                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 1996), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Secretary determines that an emission standard cannot be met within the 
specified time without creating a safety hazard.


<R05>
Sec. 87.7  Exemptions.

    (a) Exemptions based on flights for short durations at infrequent 
intervals. The emission standards of this part do not apply to engines 
which power aircraft operated in the United States for short durations 
at infrequent intervals. Such operations are limited to:
    (1) Flights of an aircraft for the purpose of export to a foreign 
country, including any flights essential to demonstrate the integrity of 
an aircraft prior to its flight to a point outside the United States.
    (2) Flights to a base where repairs, alterations or maintenance are 
to be performed, or to a point of storage, and flights for the purpose 
of returning an aircraft to service.
    (3) Official visits by representatives of foreign governments.
    (4) Other flights the Secretary determines, after consultation with 
the Administrator, to be for short durations at infrequent intervals. A 
request for such a determination shall be made before the flight takes 
place.
    (b) Exemptions for very low production models. The emissions 
standards of this part do not apply to engines of very low total 
production after the date of applicability. For the purpose of this 
part, ``very low production'' is limited to a maximum total production 
for United States civil aviation applications of no more than 200 units 
covered by the same type certificate after January 1, 1984.
    (1) A maximum annual production rate after January 1, 1984 of 20 
units covered by the same type certificate; and
    (2) A maximum total production after January 1, 1984 of 200 units 
covered by the same type certificate.
    (c) Exemptions for New Engines in Other Categories. The emissions 
standards of this part do not apply to engines for which the Secretary 
determines, with the concurrence of the Administrator, that application 
of any standard under Sec. 87.21 is not justified, based upon 
consideration of:
    (1) Adverse economic impact on the manufacturer.
    (2) Adverse economic impact on the aircraft and airline industries 
at large.
    (3) Equity in administering the standards among all economically 
competing parties.
    (4) Public health and welfare effects.
    (5) Other factors which the Secretary, after consultation with the 
Administrator, may deem relevant to the case in question.
    (d) Time Limited Exemptions for In Use Engines. The emissions 
standards of this part do not apply to aircraft or aircraft engines for 
time periods which the Secretary determines, with the concurrence of the 
Administrator, that any applicable standard under Sec. 87.11(a), 
Sec. 87.31(a), or Sec. 87.31(c), should not be applied based upon 
consideration of the following:
    (1) Documentation demonstrating that all good faith efforts to 
achieve compliance with such standard have been made.
    (2) Documentation demonstrating that the inability to comply with 
such

[[Page 8]]

standard is due to circumstances beyond the control of the owner or 
operator of the aircraft.
    (3) A plan in which the owner or operator of the aircraft shows that 
he will achieve compliance in the shortest time which is feasible.
    (4) Applications for a determination that any requirements of 
Sec. 87.11(a), Sec. 87.31(a) or Sec. 87.31(c) do not apply shall be 
submitted in duplicate to the Secretary in accordance with procedures 
established by the Secretary.
    (e) The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register the name of 
the organization to whom exemptions are granted and the period of such 
exemptions.
    (f) No state or political subdivision thereof may attempt to enforce 
a standard respecting emissions from an aircraft or engine if such 
aircraft or engine has been exempted from such standard under this part.

               (Aircraft and Aircraft Gas Turbine Engines)


<R05>
Sec. 87.60  Introduction.

    (a) Except as provided under Sec. 87.5, the procedures described in 
this subpart shall be the test program to determine the conformity of 
new aircraft gas turbine engines with the applicable standards set forth 
in this part.
    (b) The test consists of operating the engine at prescribed power 
settings on an engine dynamometer (for engines producing primarily shaft 
power) or thrust measuring test stand (for engines producing primarily 
thrust). The exhaust gases generated during engine operation are sampled 
continuously for specific component analysis through the analytical 
train.
    (c) The exhaust emission test is designed to measure hydrocarbons, 
carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide concentrations, and to determine mass 
emissions through calculations during a simulated aircraft landing-
takeoff cycle (LTO). The LTO cycle is based on time in mode data during 
high activity periods at major airports. The test for propulsion engines 
consists of a least the following four modes of engine operation: Taxi/
idle, takeoff, climbout, and approach. The mass emission for the modes 
are combined to yield the reported values.
    (d) When an engine is tested for exhaust emissions on an engine 
dynamometer or test stand, the complete

[[Page 10]]

engine shall be used with all accessories which might reasonably be 
expected to influence emissions to the atmosphere installed and 
functioning, if not otherwise prohibited by Sec. 87.62(a)(2). Use of 
service air bleed and shaft power extraction to power auxiliary gearbox-
mounted components required to drive aircraft systems is not permitted.
    (e) Other gaseous emissions measurement systems may be used if shown 
to yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the 
Administrator or the Secretary.

Sec. 88.104-94  Clean-fuel vehicle tailpipe emission standards for light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks.

    (a) A light-duty vehicle or light-duty truck will be considered as a 
TLEV, LEV, ULEV, or ZEV if it meets the applicable requirements of this 
section.
    (b) Light-duty vehicles certified to the exhaust emission standards 
for TLEVs, LEVs, and ULEVs in Tables A104-1 and A104-2 shall be 
considered as meeting the requirements of this section for that 
particular vehicle emission category for model years 1994-2000 for the 
California Pilot Program.
    (c) Light-duty vehicles certified to the exhaust emission standards 
for LEVs and ULEVs in Tables A104-1 and A104-2 shall be considered as 
meeting the requirements of this section for that particular vehicle 
emission category for model years 2001 and later for the California 
Pilot Program, and for model years 1998 and later for the Clean Fuel 
Fleet Program.
    (d) Light light-duty trucks certified to the exhaust emission 
standards for a specific weight category for TLEVs, LEVs, and ULEVs in 
Tables A104-3 and A104-4 shall be considered as meeting the requirements 
of this section for that particular vehicle emission category. For model 
years 1994-2000 for the California Pilot Program.
    (e) Light Light-duty trucks certified to the exhaust emission 
standards for a specific weight category for LEVs and ULEVs in Tables 
A104-3 and A104-4 shall be considered as meeting the requirements of 
this section for that particular vehicle emission category. For model 
years 2001 and later for the California Pilot Program, and for model 
years 1998 and later for the Clean Fuel Fleet Program.
    (f) Heavy light-duty trucks certified to the exhaust emission 
standards for a specific weight category of LEVs and ULEVs in Tables 
A104-5 and A104-6 for model years 1998 and later shall be considered as 
meeting the requirements of this section for that particular vehicle 
emission category.
    (g) A light-duty vehicle or light-duty truck shall be certified as a 
ZEV if it is determined by engineering analysis that the vehicle 
satisfies the following conditions:
    (1) The vehicle fuel system(s) must not contain either carbon or 
nitrogen compounds (including air) which, when burned, form any of the 
pollutants listed in Table A104-1 as exhaust emissions.
    (2) All primary and auxiliary equipment and engines must have no 
emissions of any of the pollutants listed in Table A104-1.
    (3) The vehicle fuel system(s) and any auxiliary engine(s) must have 
no evaporative emissions in use.
    (4) Any auxiliary heater must not operate at ambient temperatures 
above 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
    (h) NMOG standards for flexible- and dual-fueled vehicles when 
operating on

[[Page 14]]

clean alternative fuel--(1) Light-duty vehicles, and light light-duty 
trucks. Flexible- and dual-fueled LDVs and light LDTs of 1996 model year 
and later shall meet all standards in Table A104-7 for vehicles of the 
applicable model year, loaded vehicle weight, and vehicle emission 
category.
    (2) Light-duty trucks above 6,000 lbs GVWR. Flexible- and dual-
fueled LDTs above 6,000 lbs. GVWR of 1998 model year and later shall 
meet all standards in Table A104-8 for vehicles of the applicable test 
weight and vehicle emission category.
    (i) NMOG standards for flexible- and dual-fueled vehicles when 
operating on conventional fuel--(1) Light-duty vehicles, and light 
light-duty trucks. Flexible- and dual-fueled LDVs and light LDTs of 1996 
model year and later shall meet all standards in Table A104-9 for 
vehicles of the applicable model year, loaded vehicle weight, and 
vehicle emission category.
    (2) Light-duty trucks above 6,000 lbs GVWR. Flexible- and dual-
fueled LDTs of 1998 model year and later shall meet all standards in 
Table A104-10 for vehicles of the applicable test weight and vehicle 
emission category.
    (j) Other standards for flexible- and dual-fueled vehicles. When 
operating on clean alternative fuel, flexible- and dual- fueled light-
duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks must also meet the appropriate 
standards for carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, formaldehyde, and 
particulate matter as designated in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this 
section as well as all other applicable standards and requirements. When 
operating on conventional fuel, flexible- and dual-fueled vehicles must 
also meet all other applicable standards and requirements in 40 CFR part 
86.

section shall also comply with all applicable standards and requirements 
of 40 CFR part 86, except that any exhaust emission standards in 40 CFR 
part 86 pertaining to pollutants for which standards are established in 
this section shall not apply. For converted vehicles, the applicable 
standards and requirements of 40 CFR part 86 and this part 88 shall 
apply based on the model year in which the conversion is performed, 
regardless of the model year in which the base vehicle was originally 
manufactured prior to conversion.
    (1) Gaseous-fueled, diesel-fueled, and electric clean-fuel vehicles 
are waived from cold CO test requirements of subpart C of this part if 
compliance is demonstrated by engineering analysis or test data.
    (2) The standards in this section shall be administered and enforced 
in accordance with the California Regulatory Requirements Applicable to 
the Clean Fuel Fleet and California Pilot Programs, April 1, 1994, which 
are incorporated by reference.

model-year certification as permitted by regulation.
    Sales means vehicles that are produced, sold, and distributed (in 
accordance with normal business practices and applicable franchise 
agreements) in the State of California, including owners of covered 
fleets under subpart C of part 86 of this chapter. The manufacturer can 
choose at their option from one of the following three methods for 
determining sales:
    (i) Sales is defined as sales to the ultimate purchaser.
    (ii) Sales is defined as vehicle sales by a manufacturer to a 
dealer, distributer, fleet operator, broker, or any other entity which 
comprises the first point of sale.
    (iii) Sales is defined as equivalent to the production of vehicles 
for the state of California. This option can be revoked if it is 
determined that the production and actual sales numbers do not exhibit a 
functional equivalence per the language of Sec. 86.708-94(b)(1) of this

Sec. 88.204-94  Sales requirements for the California Pilot Test Program.

    (a) The total annual required minimum sales volume of new clean fuel 
vehicles in California for this program shall correspond to Table B204.
    (b) (1) When manufacturers of vehicles subject to the regulations of 
this section file a report pursuant to 40 CFR 86.085-37(b), such report 
shall include the following information: the number of light-duty 
vehicles and light-duty trucks sold only in California, and the number 
of clean-fuel vehicles sold for the Pilot program beginning with model 
year 1996.
    (2) For model years 1996 and 1997, manufacturers may exclude heavy 
light-duty trucks from the reporting required by this section.
    (c) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each 
vehicle manufacturer must sell clean-fuel vehicles in California in an 
amount equal to the required annual sales volume calculated in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section.
    (2) The required annual clean fuel vehicle sales volume for a given 
manufacturer is expressed in the following equation rounded to the 
nearest whole number:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR03JA96.003

Where:

RMS=a manufacturer's required sales in a given model year.
MS=the average of a manufacturer's total LDV and light LDT sales in 
          California three and four model years earlier than year in 
          question (for MY 1996 and 1997 RMS calculations).
  =the average of a manufacturer's total LDV and LDT sales in California 
          three and four model years earlier than year in question (for 
          MY 1998 and later RMS calculations).
TS=the average of total LDV and light LDT sales in California of all 
          manufacturers three and four model years earlier than the year 
          in question (for MY 1996 and 1997 RMS calculations). Sales of 
          manufacturers which meet the criteria of (d) of this paragraph 
          will not be included.
  =the average of total LDV and LDT sales in California of all 
          manufacturers three and four model years earlier than the year 
          in question (for MY 1998 and later RMS calculations). Sales of 
          manufacturers which meet the criteria of (d) of this paragraph 
          will not be included.
TCPPS=Pilot program annual CFV sales requirement (either 150,000 or 
          300,000) for the model year in question.

    (i) A manufacturer's share of required annual sales for model years 
1996 and 1997 will be based on LDV and light LDT sales only. Once the 
heavy LDT standards are effective beginning with model year 1998, a 
manufacturer's required sales share will be based on all LDV and LDT 
sales.
    (ii) A manufacturer certifying for the first time in California 
shall calculate annual required sales share based on projected 
California sales for the model year in question. In the second year, the 
manufacturer shall use actual sales from the previous year. In the third 
year, the manufacturer will use sales from two model years prior to the 
year in question. In the fourth year, the manufacturer will use sales 
from three years prior to the year in question. In

[[Page 19]]

the fifth year and subsequent years, the manufacturer will use average 
sales from three and four years prior to the year in question.
    (d) (1) Small volume manufacturer is defined in the Pilot program as 
one whose average annual LDV and LDT sales in California are less than 
or equal to 3,000 units during a consecutive three-year period beginning 
no earlier than model year 1993.
    (i) A manufacturer with less than three consecutive years of sales 
in California shall use a single year of sales or, if available, the 
average of two years of sales in California to determine whether they 
fall at or below the threshold of 3,000 units.
    (ii) A manufacturer certifying for the first time in California 
shall be considered a small volume manufacturer if their projected 
California sales level is at or below 3,000 units for a given year. Once 
the manufacturer has actual sales data for one year, this actual sales 
data shall be used to determine whether the manufacturer qualifies as a 
small volume manufacturer.
    (iii) A manufacturer which does not qualify as a small volume 
manufacturer in model year 1996 but whose average annual LDV and LDT 
sales fall to or below the 3,000 unit threshold between 1996 and 2001 
shall be treated as a small volume manufacturer and shall be subject to 
requirements for small volume manufacturers as specified in paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section beginning with the next model year.
    (2) A manufacturer which qualifies as a small volume manufacturer 
prior to model year 2001 is not required to comply with the sales 
requirements of this section until model year 2001.

Sec. 88.205-94  California Pilot Test Program Credits Program.

    (a) General. (1) The Administrator shall administer this credit 
program to enable vehicle manufacturers who are required to participate 
in the California Pilot Test Program to meet the clean-fuel vehicle 
sales requirements through the use of credits. Participation in this 
credit program is voluntary.
    (2) All credit-generating vehicles must meet the applicable emission 
standards and other requirements contained in subpart A of this part.
    (b) Credit generation. (1) Credits may be generated by any of the 
following means:
    (i) Sale of qualifying clean-fuel vehicles earlier than required. 
Manufacturers may earn these credits starting with the 1992 model year, 
contingent upon the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section.
    (ii) Sale of a greater number of qualifying clean-fuel vehicles than 
required.
    (iii) Sale of qualifying clean-fuel vehicles that meet more 
stringent emission standards than those required.
    (2) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, credit values 
shall be determined in accordance with the following:
    (i) For model-years through 2000, credit values shall be determined 
in accordance with table B-1 of this subpart.
    (ii) For the 2001 and subsequent model-years, credit values shall be 
determined according to table B-2 of this subpart. The sale of light-
duty vehicles classified as Transitional Low-Emission Vehicles shall not 
receive credits starting in model year 2001.
    (iii) For the calculation of credits for the sale of more clean-fuel 
vehicles than required, the manufacturer shall designate which sold 
vehicles count toward compliance with the sales requirement. The 
remaining balance of vehicles will be considered as sold beyond the 
sales requirement for credit calculations.
    (3) Vehicles greater than 8500 lbs gvwr may not generate credits.
    (c) Credit use. (1) All credits generated in accordance with these 
provisions may be freely averaged, traded, or banked for later use. 
Credits may

[[Page 20]]

not be used to remedy any nonconformity determined by enforcement 
testing.
    (2) There is one averaging and trading group containing all light-
duty vehicles and light-duty trucks.
    (3) A vehicle manufacturer desiring to demonstrate full or partial 
compliance with the sales requirements by the redemption of credits, 
shall surrender sufficient credits, as established in this paragraph 
(c). In lieu of selling a clean-fuel vehicle, a manufacturer shall 
surrender credits equal to the credit value for the corresponding 
vehicle class and model year found in table B-1.3 or table B-2.3 of this 
subpart.
    (d) Participation in the credit program. (1) During certification, 
the manufacturer shall calculate the projected credits, if any, based on 
required sales projections.
    (2) Based on information from paragraph (d)(1) of this section, each 
manufacturer's certification application under this section must 
demonstrate:
    (i) That at the end of the model-year production, there is a net 
vehicle credit balance of zero or more with any credits obtained from 
averaging, trading, or banking.
    (ii) It is recommended but not required that the source of the 
credits to be used to comply with the minimum sales requirements be 
stated. All such reports should include all credits involved in 
averaging, trading, or banking.
    (3) During the model year, manufacturers must:
    (i) Monitor projected versus actual production to be certain that 
compliance with the sales requirement is achieved at the end of the 
model year.
    (ii) Provide the end of model year reports required under this 
subpart.
    (iii) Maintain the records required under this subpart.
    (4) Projected credits based on information supplied in the 
certification application may be used to obtain a certificate of 
conformity. However, any such credits may be revoked based on review of 
end-of-model year reports, follow-up audits, and any other verification 
steps deemed appropriate by the Administrator.
    (5) Compliance under averaging, banking, and trading will be 
determined at the end of the model year.
    (6) If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error 
occurred on an end-of-year report previously submitted to EPA under this 
section, the manufacturer's credits and credit calculations will be 
recalculated.
    (i) If EPA review of a manufacturer's end-of-year report indicates 
an inadvertent credit shortfall, the manufacturer will be permitted to 
purchase the necessary credits to bring the credit balance to zero.
    (ii) If within 90 days of receipt of the manufacturer's end-of-year 
report, EPA review determines a reporting error in the manufacturer's 
favor (i.e., resulting in a positive credit balance) or if the 
manufacturer discovers such an error within 90 days of EPA receipt of 
the end-of-year report, the credits will be restored for use by the 
manufacturer.
    (e) Averaging. Averaging will only be allowed between clean-fuel 
vehicles under 8500 lbs gvwr.
    (f) Banking. (1) Credit deposits. (i) Under this program, credits 
can be banked starting in the 1992 model year.
    (ii) A manufacturer may bank credits only after the end of the model 
year and after EPA has reviewed its end-of-year report. During the model 
year and before submittal of the end-of-year report, credits originally 
designated in the certification process for banking will be considered 
reserved and may be redesignated for trading or averaging.
    (2) Credit withdraws. (i) After being generated, banked/reserved 
credits shall be available for use and shall maintain their original 
value for an infinite period of time.
    (ii) A manufacturer withdrawing banked credits shall indicate so 
during certification and in its credit reports.
    (3) Banked credits may be used in averaging, trading, or in any 
combination thereof, during the certification period. Credits declared 
for banking from the previous model year but unreviewed by EPA may also 
be used. However, they may be revoked at a later time following EPA 
review of the end-of-year report or any subsequent audit actions.
    (g) Early credits. Beginning in model year 1992 appropriate credits, 
as determined from the given credit table, will

[[Page 21]]

be given for the sale of vehicles certified to the clean-fuel vehicle 
standards for TLEVs, LEVs, ULEVs, and ZEVs, where appropriate. For LDVs 
and light LDTs (<6000 lbs GVWR), early credits can be earned from model 
year 1992 to the beginning of the Pilot Program sales requirements in 
1996. For heavy LDTs (>6000 lbs GVWR), early credits can be earned from 
model years 1992 through 1997. The actual calculation of early credits 
shall not begin until model year 1996.

sales or production mandate for CFVs or clean alternative fuels. States 
may not subject fuel or vehicle suppliers to penalties or sanctions for 
failing to produce or sell CFVs or clean alternative fuels.
    (e) (1) A state's SIP may include incentives for the sale or use in 
such state of CFVs required in California by the Clean Fuel Fleet 
Program, and the use of clean alternative fuels required to be made 
available in California by the California Pilot Program.
    (2) Incentives may include:
    (i) A registration fee on non-CFVs of at least 1 percent of the 
total cost of the vehicle. These fees shall be used to:
    (A) Provide financial incentives to purchasers of CFVs and vehicle 
dealers who sell high volumes or high percentages of CFVs.
    (B) Defray administrative costs of the incentive program.
    (ii) Exemptions for CFVs from high occupancy vehicle or trip 
reduction requirements.
    (iii) Preferences for CFVs in the use of existing parking places.

                   Subpart C--Clean-Fuel Fleet Program

    Source: 58 FR 11901, Mar. 1, 1993, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 88.301-93  General applicability.

    (a) The requirements of this subpart apply to the following:
    (1) State Implementation Plan revisions at 40 CFR part 52 made 
pursuant to sections 110 and 246 of the CAA (42 U.S.C. 7410 and 7586) 
hereafter referred to as the ``SIP revision''.
    (2) All agencies, departments and instrumentalities of the United 
States that are subject to the fleet programs established by a state's 
SIP revision.
    (b) The requirements of Secs. 88.302-93, 88.303-93, 88.311-93, 
88.312-93, and 88.313-93 of this part apply to fleets which voluntarily 
purchase and operate Inherently Low-Emission Vehicles (ILEVs).


<R05>
Sec. 88.302-93  Definitions.

    The definitions in 40 CFR part 86 of this chapter also apply to this 
subpart. The definitions in this section apply to this subpart.
    Combination heavy-duty vehicle means a vehicle with a GVWR greater 
than 8,500 pounds (3,900 kilograms) which is comprised of a truck-
tractor and one or more pieces of trailered equipment. The truck-tractor 
is a self-propelled motor vehicle built on one chassis

[[Page 23]]

which encompasses the engine, passenger compartment, and a means of 
coupling to a cargo carrying trailer(s). The truck-tractor itself is not 
designed to carry cargo.
    Inherently Low-Emission Vehicle means any LDV or LDT conforming to 
the applicable Inherently Low-Emission Vehicle standard, or any HDV with 
an engine conforming to the applicable Inherently Low-Emission Vehicle 
standard. No dual-fuel or flexible-fuel vehicles shall be considered 
Inherently Low-Emission Vehicles unless they are certified to the 
applicable standard(s) on all fuel types for which they are designed to 
operate.
    Partially-Covered Fleet pertains to a vehicle fleet in a covered 
area which contains both covered fleet vehicles and non-covered fleet 
vehicles, i.e., exempt from covered fleet purchase requirements.
    Single-unit heavy-duty vehicle means a self-propelled motor vehicle 
with a GVWR greater than 8,500 pounds (3,900 kilograms) built on one 
chassis which encompasses the engine, passenger compartment, and cargo 
carrying function, and not coupled to trailered equipment. All buses, 
whether or not they are articulated, are considered single-unit 
vehicles.


<R05>
Sec. 88.302-94  Definitions.

    The definitions in Sec. 88.302-93 and 40 CFR part 86 also apply to 
this part. All terms used in this part, but not defined in this section 
or in Sec. 88.302-93 and 40 CFR part 86 shall have the meaning assigned 
to them in the Clean Air Act.
    Can be centrally fueled means the sum of those vehicles that are 
centrally fueled and those vehicles that are capable of being centrally 
fueled.
    (1) Capable of being centrally fueled means a fleet, or that part of 
a fleet, consisting of vehicles that could be refueled 100 percent of 
the time at a location that is owned, operated, or controlled by the 
covered fleet operator, or is under contract with the covered fleet 
operator. The fact that one or more vehicles in a fleet is/are not 
capable of being centrally fueled does not exempt an entire fleet from 
the program.
    (2) Centrally fueled means a fleet, or that part of a fleet, 
consisting of vehicles that are fueled 100 percent of the time at a 
location that is owned, operated, or controlled by the covered fleet 
operator, or is under contract with the covered fleet operator. Any 
vehicle that is under normal operations garaged at home at night but 
that is, in fact, centrally fueled 100 percent of the time shall be 
considered to be centrally fueled for the purpose of this definition. 
The fact that one or more vehicles in a fleet is/are not centrally 
fueled does not exempt an entire fleet from the program. The fact that a 
vehicle is not centrally fueled does not mean it could not be centrally 
fueled in accordance with the definition of ``capable of being centrally 
fueled.''
    (3) Location means any building, structure, facility, or 
installation which; is owned or operated by a person, or is under the 
control of a person; is located on one or more contiguous properties and 
contains or could contain a fueling pump or pumps for the use of the 
vehicles owned or controlled by that person.
    Clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier means the 
business or entity that obtains a certificate of conformity with the 
clean-fuel vehicle standards and requirements for a vehicle/engine 
conversion configuration pursuant to the requirements of 40 CFR part 86 
and this part 88.
    Control means: (1) When it is used to join all entities under common 
management, means any one or a combination of the following:
    (i) A third person or firm has equity ownership of 51 percent or 
more in each of two or more firms;
    (ii) Two or more firms have common corporate officers, in whole or 
in substantial part, who are responsible for the day-to-day operation of 
the companies.
    (iii) One firm leases, operates, supervises, or in 51 percent or 
greater part owns equipment and/or facilities used by another person or 
firm, or has equity ownership of 51 percent or more of another firm.
    (2) When it is used to refer to the management of vehicles, means a 
person has the authority to decide who can operate a particular vehicle, 
and the purposes for which the vehicle can be operated.

[[Page 24]]

    (3) When it is used to refer to the management of people, means a 
person has the authority to direct the activities of another person or 
employee in a precise situation, such as at the workplace.
    Conversion configuration means any combination of vehicle/engine 
conversion hardware and a base vehicle of a specific engine family.
    Covered fleet operator means a person who operates a fleet of at 
least ten covered fleet vehicles (as defined in section 241(6) of the 
Act) and that fleet is operated in a single covered area (even if the 
covered fleet vehicles are garaged outside of it). For purposes of this 
definition, the vehicle types described in the definition of covered 
fleet (section 241(5) of the Act) as exempt from the program will not be 
counted toward the ten-vehicle criterion.
    Dealer demonstration vehicle means any vehicle that is operated by a 
motor vehicle dealer (as defined in section 216(4) of the Act) solely 
for the purpose of promoting motor vehicle sales, either on the sales 
lot or through other marketing or sales promotions, or for permitting 
potential purchasers to drive the vehicle for pre-purchase or pre-lease 
evaluation.
    Emergency vehicle means any vehicle that is legally authorized by a 
governmental authority to exceed the speed limit to transport people and 
equipment to and from situations in which speed is required to save 
lives or property, such as a rescue vehicle, fire truck, or ambulance.
    Law enforcement vehicle means any vehicle which is primarily 
operated by a civilian or military police officer or sheriff, or by 
personnel of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement 
Administration, or other agencies of the federal government, or by state 
highway patrols, municipal law enforcement, or other similar law 
enforcement agencies, and which is used for the purpose of law 
enforcement activities including, but not limited to, chase, 
apprehension, surveillance, or patrol of people engaged in or 
potentially engaged in unlawful activities. For federal law enforcement 
vehicles, the definition contained in Executive Order 12759, Section 11: 
Alternative Fueled Vehicle for the Federal Fleet, Guidance Document for 
Federal Agencies, shall apply.
    Model year, as it applies to the clean fuel vehicle fleet purchase 
requirements, means September 1 through August 31.
    Motor vehicles held for lease or rental to the general public means 
a vehicle that is owned or controlled primarily for the purpose of 
short-term rental or extended-term leasing (with or without 
maintenance), without a driver, pursuant to a contract.
    New covered fleet vehicle means a vehicle that has not been 
previously controlled by the current purchaser, regardless of the model 
year, except as follows: Vehicles that were manufactured before the 
start of the fleet program for such vehicle's weight class, vehicles 
transferred due to the purchase of a company not previously controlled 
by the purchaser or due to a consolidation of business operations, 
vehicles transferred as part of an employee transfer, or vehicles 
transferred for seasonal requirements (i.e., for less than 120 days) are 
not considered new. States are permitted to discontinue the use of the 
fourth exception for fleet operators who abuse the discretion afforded 
them. This definition of new covered fleet vehicle is distinct from the 
definition of new vehicle as it applies to manufacturer certification, 
including the certification of vehicles to the clean fuel standards.
    Owned or operated, leased or otherwise controlled by such person 
means either of the following:
    (1) Such person holds the beneficial title to such vehicle; or
    (2) Such person uses the vehicle for transportation purposes 
pursuant to a contract or similar arrangement, the term of such contract 
or similar arrangement is for a period of 120 days or more, and such 
person has control over the vehicle pursuant to the definition of 
control of this section.
    Person includes an individual, corporation, partnership, 
association, State, municipality, political subdivision of a State, and 
any agency, department, or instrumentality of the United States and any 
officer, agent, or employee thereof.
    Under normal circumstances garaged at personal residence means a 
vehicle that,

when it is not in use, is normally parked at the personal residence of 
the individual who usually operates it, rather than at a central 
refueling, maintenance, and/or business location. Such vehicles are not 
considered to be capable of being central fueled (as defined in this 
subpart) and are exempt from the program unless they are, in fact, 
centrally fueled.
    Vehicle used for motor vehicle manufacturer product evaluations and 
tests means a vehicle that is owned and operated by a motor vehicle 
manufacturer (as defined in section 216(1) of the Act), or motor vehicle 
component manufacturer, or owned or held by a university research 
department, independent testing laboratory, or other such evaluation 
facility, solely for the purpose of evaluating the performance of such 
vehicle for engineering, research and development, or quality control 
reasons.

Sec. 88.304-94  Clean-fuel fleet vehicle credit program.

    (a) General. (1) The SIP revision shall provide for a CFFV credit 
program to enable covered fleet owners/operators to meet the fleet 
vehicle purchase requirements of the CAA both by purchasing clean-fuel 
vehicles (CFVs) directly and by trading and banking CFFV credits for 
vehicle purchases.
    (2) All credit-generating vehicles must meet the applicable emission 
standards and other requirements contained in 40 CFR part 88, subpart A.
    (b) Program administration. (1)(i) Each state in which there is all 
or part of a covered area, as defined in CAA section 246(a)(2), shall 
promulgate regulations as necessary for implementing this requirement.
    (ii) The state shall submit a SIP revision before May 15, 1994 to 
the Administrator stipulating the specific mechanism by which the CFFV 
program is to be administered and enforced. The credit program shall 
commence upon EPA approval of the SIP in accordance with CAA section 
246(f)(5).
    (2) A fleet owner who purchases/leases a CFFV only to generate CFFV 
credit shall be subject to the same requirements of the state's CFFV 
program as a covered fleet owner who purchases/leases a CFFV to 
demonstrate compliance with covered fleet purchase requirements.
    (3) While in the covered area, a dual-fuel/flexible-fuel vehicle 
which a fleet owner purchases to comply with covered fleet purchase 
requirements must be operated at all times on the fuel(s) on which it 
was certified as a CFFV. If the fleet owner receives credit for a dual-
fuel/flexible-fuel vehicle purchase, the vehicle must be operated at the 
same emission level for which the vehicle generated CFFV credit.
    (c) Credit generation. (1) States shall grant CFFV credits to a 
covered fleet owner for any of the following qualifying CFFV purchases:
    (i) Purchase of a CFFV during any period subsequent to the approval 
of the SIP revision but prior to the effective date for commencement of 
a state's CFFV purchase requirement if the purchase meets all other CFFV 
requirements applicable to such purchases, including the statutory 
requirement to use only the fuel on which the vehicle was certified as a 
CFFV;
    (ii) Purchase of a greater number of CFFVs than is required under 
the SIP revision;
    (iii) Purchase of a CFFV which meets more stringent emission 
standards than required under the SIP revision; or
    (iv) Purchase of a CFFV in an exempt or non-covered vehicle category 
by the owner/operator of a covered or partially-covered fleet.
    (2) A state may retroactively grant CFFV credit(s) to a fleet owner 
for the purchase of a CFFV prior to the approval of the state's SIP 
revision if the purchase met all CFFV credit program requirements 
applicable to such purchases, including:
    (i) The vehicle purchased would have to have been certified to CFFV 
emission standards;

[[Page 26]]

    (ii) The vehicle purchased would have to have been a dedicated-fuel 
vehicle;
    (iii) If the vehicle purchased was not a dedicated-fuel vehicle, 
then the fleet owner would have to show that the vehicle had been 
operated only on the clean alternative fuel on which the vehicle had 
been certified as a CFFV.
    (3) For LDVs and LDTs, credit values shall be determined in 
accordance with Table C94-1. The state shall use Table C94-1 exclusively 
in determining LDV and LDT CFFV credit values. Table C94-1.1 applies to 
paragraphs (c)(1) (i), (ii) and (iv) of this section; Table C94-1.2 
applies to paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (4) In lieu of determining credit values in accordance with Table 
C94-1, a state may specify in its SIP revision that Table C94-2 will be 
used to determine LDV and LDT CFFV credit values in one or more affected 
nonattainment areas. Any state choosing to do so must provide adequate 
justification, based on air quality benefits, at the time the SIP 
revision is submitted. If the use of Table C94-2 is approved by EPA, the 
State shall use Table C94-2 exclusively in determining LDV and LDT CFFV 
credit values for vehicles in the subject area or areas. Table C94-2.1 
applies to paragraphs (b)(1) (i), (ii) and (iv) of this section; Table 
C94-2.2 applies to paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (5) In lieu of determining credit values in accordance with Table 
C94-1, a state containing a carbon monoxide nonattainment area(s) having 
a design value above 16.0 parts per million may specify in its SIP 
revision that Table C94-3 will be used to determine LDV and LDT CFFV 
credit values in one or more affected nonattainment areas. Any state 
choosing to do so must provide adequate justification, based on air 
quality benefits, at the time the SIP revision is submitted. If the use 
of Table C94-3 is approved by EPA, the state shall use Table C94-3 
exclusively in determining LDV and LDT CFFV credit values for vehicles 
in the subject area or areas. Table C94-3.1 applies to paragraphs (b)(1) 
(i), (ii) and (iv) of this section; Table C94-3.2 applies to paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (6) For HDVs, credit values shall be determined in accordance with 
Table C94-4. The state shall use Table C94-4 exclusively in determining 
heavy-duty vehicle CFFV credit values. Table C94-4.1 applies to 
paragraphs (c)(1) (i), (ii) and (iv) of this section, and Table C94-4.2 
applies to paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (7) In lieu of determining credit values in accordance with Table 
C94-4, a state containing a carbon monoxide nonattainment area(s) having 
a design value above 16 parts per million may specify in its SIP 
revision that Table C94-5 will be used to determine heavy-duty vehicle 
CFFV credit values in one or more affected nonattainment areas. Any 
state choosing to do so must provide adequate justification, based on 
air quality benefits, at the time the SIP revision is submitted. If the 
use of Table C94-5 is approved by EPA, the State shall use Table C94-5 
exclusively in determining heavy-duty vehicle CFFV credit values for 
vehicles in the subject area or areas. Table C94-5.1 applies to 
paragraphs (b)(1) (i), (ii) and (iv) of this section; Table C94-5.2 
applies to paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (8) Credit values shall be rounded to two decimal places.
    (9) Heavy heavy-duty vehicles. (i) States must allow purchase of any 
clean-fuel single-unit or combination HDV with a GVWR greater than 
26,000 pounds (11,800 kilograms) to generate CFFV credit for the fleet 
vehicle purchaser.
    (ii) States must exclude from generating CFFV credit the purchase of 
any combination HDV with a GVWR greater than 26,000 pounds (11,800 
kilograms) which pays all or a portion of its fuel taxes, as evidenced 
by fuel tax stickers on the combination HDV, to a state(s) which is not 
part of that covered nonattainment area.
    (10) Light-duty CFFV credits. Credits generated by the purchase of a 
qualifying clean-fuel fleet LDV or a LDT shall be designated at the time 
of issuance as light-duty CFFV credits.
    (11) Heavy-duty CFFV credits. Credits generated by the purchase of a 
qualifying clean-fuel fleet HDV shall be designated at the time of 
issuance as heavy-duty CFFV credits. Further, credits generated by the 
purchase of a light heavy-duty or a medium heavy-

[[Page 27]]

duty qualifying CFFV shall be designated at the time of issuance as 
light heavy-duty and medium heavy-duty CFFV credits, respectively.
    (d) Credit use. (1) All credits generated in accordance with these 
provisions may be freely traded or banked for later use, subject to the 
provisions contained in this subpart, without discount or depreciation 
of such credits.
    (2) A covered fleet owner or operator desiring to demonstrate full 
or partial compliance with covered fleet purchase requirements by the 
redemption of credits shall surrender sufficient credits as established 
in this paragraph. In lieu of purchasing a CFFV, a fleet owner or 
operator shall surrender credits equal to the credit value for the 
corresponding vehicle class and credit calculation method used in that 
area from either Table C94-1.3, C94-2.3, C94-3.3, C94-4.3, or C94-5.3 of 
this subpart.
    (3) Credits earned within the boundaries of a covered nonattainment 
area may be traded within those boundaries whether or not that area 
encompasses parts of more than one state.
    (4) Credits issued as a result of CFFV purchase requirements in one 
nonattainment area may not be used to demonstrate compliance in another 
nonattainment area, even if a state contains more than one covered 
nonattainment area.
    (5) Credit allocation. (i) Credits generated by the purchase of LDVs 
and LDTs of 8,500 pounds (3,900 kilograms) GVWR or less may be used to 
demonstrate compliance with covered fleet purchase requirements 
applicable to LDVs or LDTs of 8,500 pounds (3,900 kilograms) GVWR or 
less.
    (ii) Credits generated by the purchase of vehicles of more than 
8,500 pounds (3,900 kilograms) GVWR may not be used to demonstrate 
compliance with the covered fleet purchase requirements for vehicles 
weighing 8,500 pounds (3,900 kilograms) GVWR or less.
    (iii) Credits generated by the purchase of vehicles of 8,500 pounds 
(3,900 kilograms) GVWR or less may not be used to demonstrate compliance 
with requirements for vehicles of more than 8,500 pounds (3,900 
kilograms) GVWR.
    (iv) Credits generated by the purchase of a HDV of a particular 
weight subclass may be used to demonstrate compliance with required 
heavy-duty vehicle purchases for the same or lighter weight subclasses. 
These credits may not be used to demonstrate compliance with required 
HDV purchases for vehicles of heavier weight subclasses than the weight 
subclass of the vehicle which generated the credits.

<R05>
Sec. 88.306-94  Requirements for a converted vehicle to qualify as a clean-fuel fleet vehicle.

    (a) For purposes of meeting the requirements of section 246 of the 
Clean Air Act or the SIP revisions, conversions of engines or vehicles 
which satisfy the requirements of this section shall be treated as a 
purchase of a clean-fuel vehicle under subpart C of this part.
    (b) The engine or vehicle must be converted using a conversion 
configuration which has been certified according to the provisions of 40 
CFR part 86 using applicable emission standards

[[Page 28]]

and other provisions from part 88 for clean-fuel engines and vehicles. 
The following requirements will also apply:
    (1) If the installation of the certified conversion configuration is 
performed by an entity other than aftermarket conversion certifier, the 
aftermarket conversion certifier shall submit a list of such installers 
to the Administrator. Additional installers must be added to this list 
and the revised list submitted to the Administrator within 5 working 
days from the time they are authorized to perform conversion 
installations by the clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion 
certifier.
    (2) If the installation of the certified conversion configuration is 
performed by an entity other than the certificate holder, the 
certificate holder shall provide instructions for installation of the 
aftermarket conversion system to installers listed on the certificate, 
and ensure that the systems are properly installed.
    (3) For the purpose of determining whether certification under the 
Small-Volume Manufacturers Certification Program pursuant to the 
requirements of 40 CFR 86.094-14 is permitted, the 10,000 sales volume 
limit in 40 CFR 86.094-14(b)(1) is waived for a certifier of a clean-
fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion.
    (4) Clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifiers that are 
subject to the post-installation emissions testing requirements in 
paragraph (c) of this section and who will satisfy these requirements by 
using the two speed idle test procedure detailed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) 
of this section must conduct the following testing at the time of 
certification in order to generate the required certification CO 
emissions reference values. The certification CO emissions reference 
values generated must be submitted to the Administrator at the time of 
application for certification.
    (i) For dual and flexible fuel vehicles, certification reference 
values must be generated for each certification test fuel required for 
exhaust emissions testing pursuant to 40 CFR 86.113 or 40 CFR 86.1313.
    (ii) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks the test fuels 
used during the emissions testing required by paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section must comply with the fuel specifications for exhaust emissions 
testing found in 40 CFR 86.113. For heavy-duty engines the test fuels 
used during the emissions testing required by paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section must comply with the fuel specifications for exhaust emissions 
testing found in 40 CFR 86.1313.
    (iii) Single, consecutive idle mode and high-speed mode segments of 
the two speed idle test must be conducted pursuant to the requirements 
of 40 CFR 85.2215 and as modified by the provisions of paragraph 
(c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section and this paragraph to determine the 
required certification CO emission reference values.
    (A) The certification CO emission reference value for the idle mode 
of the test will be the simple average of all emissions measurements 
taken during an idle mode of 90 seconds duration pursuant to the 
requirements in 40 CFR 85.2215(a).
    (B) The certification CO emission reference value for the high-speed 
mode of the test will be the simple average of all emissions 
measurements taken during a high-speed mode of 180 seconds duration 
pursuant to the requirements in 40 CFR 85.2215(a).
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, each 
converted vehicle manufactured by a clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket 
conversion certifier with aggregate sales of less than 10,000 converted 
vehicles within a given calendar year must satisfy the post-installation 
emissions testing requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. If a 
vehicle fails to satisfy the emissions testing requirements such vehicle 
may not be considered a clean- fuel vehicle until such noncompliance is 
rectified and compliance is demonstrated.
    (1) A clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier with 
estimated sales of 300 or fewer engines and vehicles in a calendar year 
and which sells or converts vehicles outside of a non-attainment area 
(as classified under subpart D of Title I) which has an inspection and 
maintenance program that includes a test of carbon monoxide emissions 
may submit a request to the Administrator for an exemption from

[[Page 29]]

the post-installation emission test requirements of paragraph (c) of 
this section. If granted, such an exemption would apply to converted 
vehicles that have the conversion installation performed outside of a 
nonattainment area which has an inspection and maintenance program that 
includes a test of carbon monoxide emissions.
    (i) The request for exemption submitted to the Administrator must 
include the following:
    (A) The estimated number of engines and vehicles that will be 
converted in the calendar year.
    (B) Sufficient information to demonstrate that complying with the 
post-installation emission test requirement represents a severe 
financial hardship.
    (C) A description of any emission related quality control procedures 
used.
    (ii) Within 120 days of receipt of the application for exemption, 
the Administrator will notify the applicant either that an exemption is 
granted or that sufficient cause for an exemption has not been 
demonstrated and that all of the clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket 
conversion certifier's vehicles are subject to the post-installation 
test requirement of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (iii) If the clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier 
granted an exemption originally estimates that 300 or fewer conversions 
would be performed in the calendar year, and then later revises the 
estimate to more than 300 for the year, the certifier shall inform the 
Administrator of such revision. A post-installation emissions test for 
each conversion performed after the estimate is revised is required 
pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The 
estimated number of conversions from such a clean-fuel vehicle 
aftermarket conversion certifier must be greater than 300 in the 
following calendar year.
    (2) A clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier with 
aggregate sales less than 10,000 converted vehicles within a given 
calendar year shall conduct post-installation emissions testing using 
either of the following test methods:
    (i) The carbon monoxide (CO) emissions of the converted vehicle must 
be determined in the manner in which CO emissions are determined 
according to the inspection and maintenance requirements applicable in 
the area in which the vehicle is converted or is expected to be 
operated.
    (A) For dual-fuel vehicles, a separate test is required for each 
fuel on which the vehicle is capable of operating. For flexible fuel 
vehicles, a single test is required on a fuel that falls within the 
range of fuel mixtures for which the vehicle was designed. The test 
fuel(s) used must be commercially available.
    (B) A converted vehicle shall be considered to meet the requirements 
of this paragraph if the vehicle's measured exhaust CO concentration(s) 
is lower than the cutpoint(s) used to determine CO pass/fail under the 
inspection and maintenance program in the area in which the conversion 
is expected to be operated.
    (1) If CO pass/fail criteria are not available for a vehicle fuel 
type then pass/fail criteria specific to gasoline use are to be used for 
vehicles of that fuel type.
    (2) [Reserved].
    (ii) The carbon monoxide (CO) emissions of the converted vehicle 
must be determined in the manner specified in the two speed idle test-
EPA 91 found in 40 CFR 85.2215. All provisions in the two speed idle 
test must be observed except as detailed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(D) of 
this section.
    (A) For dual and flexible fuel vehicles, a separate test is required 
for each certification test fuel required for exhaust emissions testing 
pursuant to 40 CFR 86.113 or 40 CFR 86.1313.
    (B) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks the test fuels 
used during the emissions testing required by paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section must comply with the fuel specifications for exhaust emissions 
testing found in 40 CFR 86.113. For heavy-duty engines the test fuels 
used during the emissions testing required by paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section must comply with the fuel specifications for exhaust emissions 
testing found in 40 CFR 86.1313.
    (C) A converted vehicle shall be considered to meet the requirements 
of this paragraph if the following criteria are satisfied:
    (1) The vehicle's measured idle mode exhaust CO concentration(s) 
must be lower than the sum of 0.4 percent CO

[[Page 30]]

plus the idle mode certification CO emissions reference value as 
determined according to the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section.
    (2) The vehicle's measured high-speed mode exhaust CO 
concentration(s) must be lower than the sum of 0.4 percent CO plus the 
high-speed certification CO emissions reference value as determined 
according to the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (D) For the purposes of the post-installation emissions testing 
required by paragraph (c) of this section, the following adjustments to 
the two speed idle test-EPA 91 in 40 CFR 85.2215 are necessary.
    (1) Testing of hydrocarbon emissions and equipment associated solely 
with hydrocarbon emissions testing is not required.
    (2) The CO emissions pass/fail criteria in 40 CFR 85.2215(a)(2), 
(c)(1)(ii)(A), (c)(2)(ii)(A)(1), (c)(2)(iii)(A)(1), and (d)(3)(i) are to 
be replaced with the pass/fail criteria detailed in paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section. All HC pass/fail criteria in 40 CFR 
85.2215 do not apply.
    (3) The void test criteria in 40 CFR 85.2215(a)(3) and (b)(2)(iv) 
associated with maintaining the measured concentration of CO plus 
CO<SUP>2 above six percent does not apply. However, the Administrator 
may reconsider requiring that the void test criteria in 40 CFR 
85.2215(a)(3) and (b)(2)(iv) be applied, and may issue an advisory 
memorandum to this effect in the future.
    (4) The ambient temperature levels encountered by the vehicle during 
testing must comply with the specifications in 40 CFR 86.130 or 40 CFR 
86.1330.
    (d) The clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier shall be 
considered a manufacturer for purposes of Clean Air Act sections 206 and 
207 and related enforcement provisions, and must accept liability for 
in-use performance of all the vehicles produced under the certificate of 
conformity as outlined in 40 CFR part 85.
    (1) The useful life period for the purposes of determining the in-
use liability of the clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier 
shall be the original useful life of the vehicle prior to conversion.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (e) Tampering. (1) The conversion from an engine or vehicle capable 
of operating on gasoline or diesel fuel only to a clean-fuel engine or 
vehicle shall not be considered a violation of the tampering provisions 
of Clean Air Act section 203(a)(3), if such conversion is done pursuant 
to a conversion configuration certificate by the aftermarket conversion 
certifier or by an installer listed on the certificate.
    (2) In order to comply with the provisions of this subpart, an 
aftermarket conversion installer must:
    (i) Install a certified aftermarket conversion system for which the 
installer is listed by the certifier; and
    (ii) Perform such installation according to instructions provided by 
the aftermarket conversion certifier.
    (f) Data collection. The clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion 
certifier is responsible for maintaining records of each engine and 
vehicle converted for use in the Clean Fuel Fleets program for a period 
of 5 years. The records are to include the engine or vehicle make, 
engine or vehicle model, engine or vehicle model year, and engine or 
vehicle identification number of converted engines and vehicles; the 
certification number of the conversion configuration; the brand names 
and part numbers of the parts included in the conversion configuration; 
the date of the conversion and the facility at which the conversion was 
performed; and the results of post-installation emissions testing if 
required pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.

(TCMs) existing wholly or partially for air quality reasons included in 
an approved state implementation plan which restrict vehicle usage based 
primarily on temporal

[[Page 31]]

considerations, such as time-of-day and day-of-week exemptions. However, 
CFFVs shall not qualify for TCMs where the temporal element is secondary 
to some other control element and, in no case, shall such exemptions 
apply if they create a clear and direct safety hazard. This exemption 
does not include access to high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, except as 
provided in Sec. 88.313-93.
    (b) States shall also grant temporal TCM exemptions to qualifying 
CFFVs being operated after SIP approval, but prior to the effective date 
for commencement of a state's CFFV credit program.
    (c) Temporal TCM exemptions provided for in paragraph (a) of this 
section are not effective outside of the areas for which states can be 
required to establish CFFV credit programs.
    (1) Such exemptions shall remain effective only while the subject 
vehicle remains in compliance with applicable CFFV emissions standards 
and other CFFV credit program requirements.
    (2) CFFV TCM exemptions shall not be transferred between vehicles 
within the same fleet nor shall they be sold or traded.

Sec. 88.311-93  Emissions standards for Inherently Low-Emission Vehicles.

    (a) Certification. (1) Emissions Testing Procedures. A vehicle shall 
be certified as an ILEV if that vehicle satisfies the following 
conditions:
    (i) The vehicle shall be certified under the appropriate exhaust 
emissions standards from paragraph (c) or (d) of this section depending 
on the vehicle's weight classification.
    (ii) The vehicle shall be certified as having fuel vapor emissions 
which are five or less total grams per test as measured by the current 
Federal Test Procedure (FTP), modified for ILEV certification, from 40 
CFR part 86, subpart B for LDVs and LDTs and from 40 CFR part 86, 
subpart M for HDVs.
    (A) After disabling any and all auxiliary emission control devices 
(canister, purge system, etc.) related to control of evaporative 
emissions, the fuel vapor emissions shall be measured using the FTP 
regulations in effect at the time the vehicle is to be certified as an 
ILEV. For purposes of this section, the vehicle's fuel vapor emissions 
shall consist of the total grams of diurnal, hot soak, running loss, and 
resting loss emissions, as appropriate, for the particular fuel/vehicle/
engine combination to be tested. In determining ILEV evaporative 
emissions, the diurnal emissions measurement procedure shall consist of 
a single diurnal heat build using an ambient or fuel temperature range 
of 72 deg.-96  deg.F (22 deg.-36  deg.C), as appropriate for the 
applicable FTP regulations (40 CFR part 86).

[[Page 32]]

    (B) Conventional Federal Test Procedure. A vehicle with no 
evaporative emissions control system components may have its evaporative 
emissions certified for its particular GVWR weight class/subclass if it 
passes the conventional evaporative emissions FTP from 40 CFR part 86, 
subpart B for LDVs and LDTs or from 40 CFR part 86, subpart M for HDVs, 
as applicable.
    (iii) The vehicle must meet other special requirements applicable to 
conventional or clean-fuel vehicles and their fuels as described in any 
other parts of this chapter, including 40 CFR parts 86 and 88.
    (2) Vehicles which have a closed or sealed fuel system may be 
certified at the administrator's option by engineering evaluation in 
lieu of testing. These vehicles will be certified as ILEVs only if a 
leak in the fuel system would result in the vehicle becoming inoperative 
due to loss of fuel supply, or if half the fuel escapes within 24 hours.
    (b) Identification. In the application for a vehicle's certification 
as an ILEV, the manufacturer or the manufacturer's agent shall provide 
for positive identification of the vehicle's status as an ILEV in the 
vehicle's Vehicle Emission Control Information (VECI) label in 
accordance with 40 CFR 86.094-35 and 86.095-35. The label shall contain 
a highlighted statement (e.g., underscored or boldface letters) that the 
vehicle is certified to applicable emission standards for ILEV exhaust 
and evaporative emission standards.
    (c) Light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. ILEVs in LDV and LDT 
classes shall have exhaust emissions which do not exceed the LEV exhaust 
emission standards for NMOG, CO, HCHO, and PM and the ULEV exhaust 
emission standards for NO<INF>x listed in Tables A104-1 through A104-6 
for light-duty CFVs. Exhaust emissions shall be measured in accordance 
with the test procedures specified in Sec. 88.104-94(k). An ILEV must be 
able to operate on only one fuel, or must be certified as an ILEV on all 
fuels on which it can operate. These vehicles shall also comply with all 
requirements of 40 CFR part 86 which are applicable to conventional 
gasoline-fueled, methanol-fueled, diesel-fueled, natural gas-fueled or 
liquified petroleum gas-fueled LDVs/LDTs of the same vehicle class and 
model year.

    (d) Heavy-duty vehicles. ILEVs in the HDV class shall have exhaust 
emissions which do not exceed the exhaust emission standards in grams 
per brake horsepower-hour listed in Sec. 88.105-94(d). Exhaust emissions 
shall be measured in accordance with the test procedures specified in 
Sec. 88.105-94(e). An ILEV must be able to operate on only one fuel, or 
must be certified as an ILEV on all fuels on which it can operate. These 
vehicles shall also comply with all requirements of 40 CFR part 86 which 
are applicable in the case of conventional gasoline-fueled, methanol-
fueled, diesel-fueled, natural gas-fueled or liquified petroleum gas-
fueled HDVs of the same weight class and model year.
    (e) Applicability. State actions to opt out of the clean-fuel fleet 
program under section 182(c) of the Act do not affect the applicability 
of the ILEV program in the affected states.

Sec. 88.312-93  Inherently Low-Emission Vehicle labeling.

    (a) Label design. (1) Label design shall consist of either of the 
following specifications:
    (i) The label shall consist of a white rectangular background, 
approximately 12 inches (30 centimeters) high by 18 inches (45 
centimeters) wide, with ``CLEAN AIR VEHICLE'' printed in contrasting 
block capital letters at least 4.3 inches (10.6 centimeters) tall and 
1.8 inches (4.4 centimeters) wide with a stroke width not less than 0.5 
inches (1.3 centimeters). In addition, the words ``INHERENTLY LOW-
EMISSION VEHICLE'' must be present in lettering no smaller than 1 inch 
(2.5 centimeters) high. Nothing shall be added to the label which 
impairs readability. Labels shall include a serialized identification 
number; or
    (ii) The label shall consist of a white truncated-circular 
background, approximately 10 inches (25 centimeters) in diameter by 7 
inches (17.5 centimeters) in height. The bottom edge of the truncated-
circular background shall be approximately 2 inches (5 centimeters) from 
the center. The acronym ``ILEV'' shall be printed on the label in 
contrasting block capital letters at least 2 inches (5 centimeters) tall 
and 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) wide with a stroke width not less than 
0.4 inches (1.0 centimeter). In addition, the words ``CLEAN AIR 
VEHICLE'' must be present in lettering no smaller than 0.8 inches (2.0 
centimeters) high. Nothing shall be added to the label which impairs 
readability. Labels shall include a serialized identification number.
    (2) The ILEV label shall be fabricated or affixed to a vehicle in 
such a manner that its removal from the vehicle cannot be accomplished 
without defacing or destroying the label in whole or in part.
    (3) Along with the manufacturer's application to certify a 
particular ILEV engine class, the manufacturer or the manufacturer's 
agent shall submit to EPA ILEV labels or reasonable facsimiles of the 
types which may be mounted on a certified ILEV vehicle of that class.
    (b) Eligibility. Vehicle manufacturers or their agents must install 
ILEV labels on a certified ILEV vehicle at the time of its sale to an 
eligible fleet owner if the vehicle is to be eligible for expanded TCM 
exemptions. An eligible fleet owner is one who is in a covered area and 
owns a total of at least ten motor vehicles (including the ILEV(s) being 
purchased) which operate in the owner's fleet. All of the following 
shall be provided to demonstrate eligibility: Photocopies of no less 
than nine motor vehicle registrations indicating registration in the 
ILEV purchaser's name, a signed statement by the ILEV purchaser that 
these vehicles are operational in the purchaser's fleet and that the 
ILEV being purchased will also be operated in this fleet, and a signed 
statement by the ILEV purchaser that the ILEV labels will be removed and 
disposed of when the vehicle is sold, given, leased (except as part of a 
daily rental fleet), or offered for long-term loan to someone who has 
not demonstrated eligibility for expanded TCMs available to ILEVs 
according to these criteria.
    (c) ILEV Label installation. (1) Except as provided for in this 
paragraph (c), no person shall attach an ILEV label or any facsimile of 
an ILEV label to any vehicle.
    (2)(i) The manufacturer or the manufacturer's agent shall attach 
three labels on the vehicle in plain sight: One on the rear of the 
vehicle and one on each of two sides of the vehicle. Each label shall 
conform to the specifications of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (ii) In the case that an ILEV label of the proportions specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section cannot be attached to the rear of the 
ILEV, the manufacturer or the manufacturer's agent shall attach to the 
rear of the vehicle an ILEV label of either of the following 
proportions:
    (A) The label shall consist of a white rectangular background, 
approximately 4 inches (10 centimeters) high by 24 inches (60 
centimeters) wide, with ``CLEAN AIR VEHICLE'' printed in contrasting 
block capital letters at least 2.8 inches (7 centimeters) tall and 1.3 
inches (3.3 centimeters) wide with a

[[Page 34]]

stroke width not less than 0.3 inches (0.8 centimeter). In addition, the 
words ``INHERENTLY LOW-EMISSION VEHICLE'' must be present in lettering 
no smaller than 0.6 inches (1.5 centimeters) high. Nothing shall be 
added to the label which impairs readability. Labels shall include a 
serialized identification number; or
    (B) The label shall consist of a white truncated-circular 
background, approximately 5 inches (12.5 centimeters) in diameter by 3.5 
inches (8.8 centimeters) in height. The bottom edge of the truncated-
circular background shall be approximately 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) from 
the center. The acronym ``ILEV'' shall be printed on the label in 
contrasting block capital letters at least 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) tall 
and 0.8 inches (2.0 centimeters) wide with a stroke width not less than 
0.3 inches (0.8 centimeters). In addition, the words ``CLEAN AIR 
VEHICLE'' must be present in lettering no smaller than 0.4 inches (1.0 
centimeter) high. Nothing shall be added to the label which impairs 
readability. Labels shall include a serialized identification number.
    (d) Label removal. Fleet ILEV owners shall remove and dispose of the 
ILEV labels on a vehicle before selling or transferring ownership of an 
ILEV or offering it for lease (unless the ILEV is part of a daily rental 
fleet) or long-term loan. This provision shall not apply if the person 
who is receiving the vehicle demonstrates eligibility for expanded TCM 
exemptions under the federal ILEV program as described in paragraph (b) 
of this section, or is otherwise qualified under state regulations which 
expressly expand ILEV label eligibility.
    (e) Label replacement. (1) The manufacturer shall make replacement 
ILEV labels available to the fleet owner of a qualifying ILEV to replace 
any ILEV label which has been lost or removed due to vehicle damage, 
repair, sale, or lease. The fleet owner's request shall include proof of 
ownership of the ILEV in question and proof of the fleet owner's 
eligibility for ILEV TCM exemptions, as outlined in paragraph (c) of 
this section. Each label shall be imprinted with the same serial number 
as initially assigned to the damaged/missing ILEV label(s) for that 
vehicle. Any portion of a damaged label remaining on the ILEV shall be 
removed from the vehicle and submitted with the request as proof of 
loss.
    (2) Upon receipt of the replacement ILEV label(s), the fleet owner 
shall attach the new ILEV label(s) only to the vehicle for which 
replacement ILEV label(s) were requested.

Sec. 88.313-93  Incentives for the purchase of Inherently Low-Emission Vehicles.

    (a) Administration. (1) The incentives granted to ILEVs provided in 
this section are not effective outside of nonattainment areas for which 
states are required to establish CFFV programs under section 246 of the 
CAA, unless specifically added by states for qualifying vehicles.
    (2) Incentives for purchasing ILEVs shall not be transferred between 
vehicles within the same fleet nor shall they be sold or traded.
    (3) No vehicle over 26,000 pounds (11,800 kilograms) GVWR shall be 
eligible for the following ILEV incentives.
    (b) Exemption from temporal TCMs. A fleet vehicle which has been 
certified and labeled as an ILEV according to the provisions of this 
section and which continues to be in compliance with applicable 
emissions standards and other ILEV program requirements shall be 
exempted from TCMs existing for air quality reasons included in approved 
state implementation plans which restrict vehicle usage based primarily 
on temporal considerations, such as time-of-day and day-of-week 
exemptions.
    (c) Exemption from high-occupancy vehicle lane restrictions. (1) A 
fleet vehicle which has been certified and labeled as an ILEV according 
to the provisions of Secs. 88.311 and 88.312 and which continues to be 
in compliance with applicable emissions standards and other ILEV program 
requirements shall be exempt from TCMs which restrict a vehicle's access 
to certain roadway lanes based

[[Page 35]]

on the number of occupants in that vehicle, usually known as high-
occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes. These exemptions shall not apply if they 
would create a clear and direct safety hazard.
    (2) In a state containing a covered area, or areas, the governor may 
petition the Administrator for a waiver from the exemption from HOV lane 
restrictions for ILEVs for any section of HOV lane in the covered 
area(s) that can be shown to be congested primarily due to the operation 
or projected operation of ILEVs. The waiver application shall 
demonstrate the infeasibility of other means of alleviating HOV/CAV lane 
congestion, such as adding an additional HOV/CAV lane, further 
increasing vehicle occupancy requirements and reducing the use of the 
lane by noneligible vehicles.

<R05>
Sec. 89.2  Definitions.

    The following definitions apply to part 89. All terms not defined 
herein have the meaning given them in the Act.
    Act means the Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.
    Adjustable parameter means any device, system, or element of design 
which is physically capable of being adjusted (including those which are 
difficult to access) and which, if adjusted, may affect emissions or 
engine performance during emission testing.
    Administrator means the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency or his or her authorized representative.
    Auxiliary emission control device (AECD) means any element of design 
that senses temperature, vehicle speed, engine RPM, transmission gear, 
or any other parameter for the purpose of activating, modulating, 
delaying, or deactivating the operation of any part of the emission 
control system.
    Certification means, with respect to new nonroad engines, obtaining 
a certificate of conformity for an engine family complying with the 
nonroad engine emission standards and requirements specified in this 
part.
    Emission control system means any device, system, or element of 
design which controls or reduces the emission of substances from an 
engine.
    Engine, as used in this part, refers to nonroad engine.
    Engine manufacturer means any person engaged in the manufacturing or 
assembling of new nonroad engines or importing such engines for resale, 
or who acts for and is under the control of any such person in 
connection with the distribution of such engines. Engine manufacturer 
does not include any dealer with respect to new nonroad engines received 
by such person in commerce.
    Engine used in a locomotive means either an engine placed in the 
locomotive to move other equipment, freight, or passenger traffic, or an 
engine mounted on the locomotive to provide auxiliary power.
    EPA enforcement officer means any officer or employee of the 
Environmental Protection Agency so designated in writing by the 
Administrator (or by his or her designee).
    Family emission limit (FEL) means an emission level that is declared 
by the manufacturer to serve in lieu of an emission standard for 
certification purposes and for the averaging, banking, and trading 
program. A FEL must be expressed to the same number of decimal places as 
the applicable emission standard.
    Gross power means the power measured at the crankshaft or its 
equivalent, the engine being equipped only with the standard accessories 
(such as oil pumps, coolant pumps, and so forth) necessary for its 
operation on the test bed. Alternators must be used, if necessary, to 
run the engine. Fans, air conditioners, and other accessories may be 
used at the discretion of the

[[Page 41]]

manufacturer, but no power adjustments for these accessories may be 
made.
    Identification number means a specification (for example, model 
number/serial number combination) which allows a particular nonroad 
engine to be distinguished from other similar engines.
    Locomotive means a self-propelled piece of on-track equipment (other 
than equipment designed for operation both on highways and rails, 
specialized maintenance equipment, and other similar equipment) designed 
for moving other equipment, freight or passenger traffic.
    Model year (MY) means the manufacturer's annual new model production 
period which includes January 1 of the calendar year, ends no later than 
December 31 of the calendar year, and does not begin earlier than 
January 2 of the previous calendar year. Where a manufacturer has no 
annual new model production period, model year means calendar year.
    New, for the purposes of this part, means a domestic or imported 
nonroad engine, nonroad vehicle, or nonroad equipment the equitable or 
legal title to which has never been transferred to an ultimate 
purchaser. Where the equitable or legal title to the engine, vehicle, or 
equipment is not transferred to an ultimate purchaser until after the 
engine, vehicle or equipment is placed into service, then the engine, 
vehicle, or equipment will no longer be new after it is placed into 
service. A nonroad engine, vehicle, or equipment is placed into service 
when it is used for its functional purposes.
    Nonroad compression-ignition engine means a nonroad engine which 
utilizes the compression-ignition combustion cycle.
    Nonroad engine means:
    (1) Except as discussed in paragraph (2) of this definition, a 
nonroad engine is any internal combustion engine:
    (i) in or on a piece of equipment that is self-propelled or serves a 
dual purpose by both propelling itself and performing another function 
(such as garden tractors, off-highway mobile cranes and bulldozers); or
    (ii) in or on a piece of equipment that is intended to be propelled 
while performing its function (such as lawnmowers and string trimmers); 
or
    (iii) that, by itself or in or on a piece of equipment, is portable 
or transportable, meaning designed to be and capable of being carried or 
moved from one location to another. Indicia of transportability include, 
but are not limited to, wheels, skids, carrying handles, dolly, trailer, 
or platform.
    (2) An internal combustion engine is not a nonroad engine if:
    (i) the engine is used to propel a motor vehicle or a vehicle used 
solely for competition, or is subject to standards promulgated under 
section 202 of the Act; or
    (ii) the engine is regulated by a federal New Source Performance 
Standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act; or
    (iii) the engine otherwise included in paragraph (1)(iii) of this 
definition remains or will remain at a location for more than 12 
consecutive months or a shorter period of time for an engine located at 
a seasonal source. A location is any single site at a building, 
structure, facility, or installation. Any engine (or engines) that 
replaces an engine at a location and that is intended to perform the 
same or similar function as the engine replaced will be included in 
calculating the consecutive time period. An engine located at a seasonal 
source is an engine that remains at a seasonal source during the full 
annual operating period of the seasonal source. A seasonal source is a 
stationary source that remains in a single location on a permanent basis 
(i.e., at least two years) and that operates at that single location 
approximately three months (or more) each year. This paragraph does not 
apply to an engine after the engine is removed from the location.
    Nonroad equipment means equipment that is powered by nonroad 
engines.
    Nonroad vehicle means a vehicle that is powered by a nonroad engine 
as defined in this section and that is not a motor vehicle or a vehicle 
used solely for competition.
    Nonroad vehicle or nonroad equipment manufacturer means any person 
engaged in the manufacturing or assembling of new nonroad vehicles or 
equipment or importing such vehicles or

[[Page 42]]

equipment for resale, or who acts for and is under the control of any 
such person in connection with the distribution of such vehicles or 
equipment. A nonroad vehicle or equipment manufacturer does not include 
any dealer with respect to new nonroad vehicles or equipment received by 
such person in commerce.
    Opacity means the fraction of a beam of light, expressed in percent, 
which fails to penetrate a plume of smoke.
    Operating hours means:
    (1) For engine storage areas or facilities, all times during which 
personnel other than custodial personnel are at work in the vicinity of 
the storage area or facility and have access to it.
    (2) For all other areas or facilities, all times during which an 
assembly line is in operation or all times during which testing, 
maintenance, service accumulation, production or compilation of records, 
or any other procedure or activity related to certification testing, to 
translation of designs from the test stage to the production stage, or 
to engine manufacture or assembly is being carried out in a facility.
    Presentation of credentials means the display of the document 
designating a person as an EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized 
representative.
    Test fleet means the engine or group of engines that a manufacturer 
uses during certification to determine compliance with emission 
standards.
    Ultimate purchaser means, with respect to any new nonroad engine, 
new nonroad vehicle, or new nonroad equipment, the first person who in 
good faith purchases such new nonroad engine, nonroad vehicle, or 
nonroad equipment for purposes other than resale.
    Used solely for competition means exhibiting features that are not 
easily removed and that would render its use other than in competition 
unsafe, impractical, or highly unlikely.

Sec. 89.4  Section numbering.

    (a) Sections are numbered sequentially by subpart.
    (b) Where two different standards or requirements are concurrently 
applicable, the model year of applicability is indicated by the number 
following the main section number. The two digits following the hyphen 
designate the first model year for which a section is effective.

    Example: Section 89.304-96 applies to the 1996 and subsequent model 
years until superseded. If a Sec. 89.304-98 is promulgated, it would 
take effect beginning with the 1998 model year; Sec. 89.304-96 would 
apply to model years 1996 through 1997. Therefore, in calendar year 
1997, a manufacturer may be certifying both 1997 and 1998 model year 
engines, requiring the use of different requirements concurrently.

    Note: Model year 2000 and later will appear sequentially with 1999 
and earlier based on the order of the last two digits of the year,

[[Page 43]]

not in calendar year order; that is, Sec. 89.304-03 will appear before 
Sec. 89.304-99.

    (c) A section without the model year designation is applicable to 
all model years as designated in the applicability section for the 
subpart or part or in the text of the section.


<R05>
Sec. 89.5  Table and figure numbering; position.

    (a) Tables for each subpart appear in an appendix at the end of the 
subpart. Tables are numbered consecutively by order of appearance in the 
appendix. The table title will indicate the model year (if applicable) 
and the topic.
    (b) Figures for each subpart appear in an appendix at the end of the 
subpart. Figures are numbered consecutively by order of appearance in 
the appendix. The figure title will indicate the model year (if 
applicable) and the topic.

Appendix A to Subpart A--Internal Combustion Engines Manufactured Prior 
                            to July 18, 1994

    This appendix sets forth the Environmental Protection Agency's 
(EPA's) interpretation of the Clean Air Act regarding the status of 
certain internal combustion engines manufactured before July 18, 1994, 
(the effective date of the final rulemaking promulgating EPA's 
definition of nonroad engine). This interpretation does not alter, 
replace, supersede, or change the scope of subpart A. It is not final 
agency action subject to judicial review.
    1. EPA interprets the Clean Air Act as not precluding state 
regulation of internal combustion engines manufactured prior to July

[[Page 45]]

18, 1994, except that state regulation of such engines that are used in 
motor vehicles or vehicles used solely for competition is precluded. EPA 
believes that the language of Clean Air Act section 302(z) generally 
excluding emissions resulting directly from nonroad engines and nonroad 
vehicles from the definition of stationary source could not be applied 
until after the definition of nonroad engine was specified in final 
regulations promulgated by EPA. EPA believes that if the exclusionary 
language of section 302(z) were applied before EPA's definition of 
nonroad engine became final, states would have been frustrated from 
regulating internal combustion engines manufactured during that time, 
given the uncertain nature of the definition of such engines. EPA 
believes that Congress did not intend states to be prevented from 
regulating these engines before a final EPA definition was promulgated. 
EPA does not believe that Congress intended the exclusionary language of 
section 302(z) regarding nonroad engines and vehicles to be applied 
retroactively to engines, vehicles, and equipment regulated pursuant to 
a permit issued before the date that the terms nonroad engine and 
nonroad vehicle were defined.
    2. EPA further believes that internal combustion engines 
manufactured prior to July 18, 1994 are not preempted, under Clean Air 
Act section 209, from state regulation. The two sections of the Act 
preempting state regulation of nonroad engines, section 209(e)(1) and 
section 209(a) (as incorporated by section 213(d)), refer to ``nonroad 
engines subject to regulation under this Act'' or to engines ``subject 
to this part'' (i.e., part A of title II of the Act). EPA believes that, 
until EPA promulgated final regulations defining nonroad engines and 
subjecting such engines to regulation, these engines were not preempted 
from state regulation under the Act, as the engines were not yet defined 
as nonroad engines, nor were they subject to any regulation under title 
II of the Act. In the regulations with an effective date of July 18, 
1994, EPA has issued final rules defining nonroad engines and, thus, 
subjecting nonroad engines to regulation under part A of title II of the 
Act. Accordingly, EPA believes that pursuant to Clean Air Act section 
209, state regulation of new nonroad engines is preempted for engines 
manufactured on or after that date, and is not preempted as to engines 
manufactured before that date.
    3. Moreover, EPA believes that states are not precluded under 
section 209 from regulating the use and operation of nonroad engines, 
such as regulations on hours of usage, daily mass emission limits, or 
sulfur limits on fuel; nor are permits regulating such operations 
precluded once the engine is placed into service or once the equitable 
or legal title to the engine or vehicle is transferred to an ultimate 
purchaser, as long as no certification, inspection, or other approval 
related to the control on emissions is required as a condition precedent 
to the initial retail sale, titling, or registration of the engine or 
equipment. EPA believes that states are not prevented by section 209 
from requiring retrofitting of nonroad engines in certain circumstances 
once a reasonable time has passed after the engine is no longer new, as 
long as the requirements do not amount to a standard relating back to 
the original manufacturer. Therefore, EPA believes that modest retrofit 
requirements may be required after a reasonable amount of time (e.g., at 
the time of reregistration or rebuilding) and more significant retrofit 
requirements may be required after a more significant period of time 
(e.g., after the end of the useful life of the engine).

<R05>
Sec. 89.116-96  Engine families.

    (a) A manufacturer's product line is divided into engine families 
that are comprised of engines expected to have similar emission 
characteristics throughout their useful life periods.
    (b) The following characteristics distinguish engine families:
    (1) Fuel;
    (2) Cooling medium;
    (3) Method of air aspiration;
    (4) Method of exhaust aftertreatment (for example, catalytic 
converter or particulate trap);
    (5) Combustion chamber design;
    (6) Bore;
    (7) Stroke;
    (8) Number of cylinders, (engines with aftertreatment devices only); 
and
    (9) Cylinder arrangement (engines with aftertreatment devices only).
    (c) Upon a showing by the manufacturer that the useful life period 
emission characteristics are expected to be similar, engines differing 
in one or more of the characteristics in paragraph (b) of this section 
may be grouped in the same engine family.
    (d) Upon a showing by the manufacturer that the expected useful life 
period emission characteristics will be different, engines identical in 
all the characteristics of paragraph (b) of this section may be divided 
into separate engine families.


<R05>
Sec. 89.117-96  Test fleet selection.

    (a) The manufacturer must select for testing, from each engine 
family, the engine with the most fuel injected per stroke of an injector 
at maximum power.
    (b) Each engine in the test fleet must be constructed to be 
representative of production engines.
    (c) After review of the manufacturer's test fleet, the Administrator 
may select from the available fleet one additional test engine from each 
engine family.


<R05>
Sec. 89.118-96  Service accumulation.

    (a)(1) Each test engine in the test fleet must be operated with all 
emission control systems operating properly for a period sufficient to 
stabilize emissions.
    (2) A manufacturer may elect to consider as stabilized emission 
levels from engines with no more than 125 hours of service.
    (b) No maintenance, other than recommended lubrication and filter 
changes, may be performed during service accumulation without the 
Administrator's approval.
    (c) Service accumulation should be performed in a manner using good 
engineering judgment to ensure that emissions are representative of in-
use engines.
    (d) The manufacturer must maintain, and provide to the Administrator 
if requested, records stating the rationale

[[Page 50]]

for selecting the service accumulation period and records describing the 
method used to accumulate service hours on the test engine(s).


<R05>
Sec. 89.119-96  Emission tests.

    (a) Manufacturer testing. (1) Upon completion of service 
accumulation, the manufacturer must test each test engine using the 
specified test procedures, except as provided in Sec. 89.114-96. The 
procedures to be used are set forth in:
    (i) Subpart E of this part;
    (ii) The California Regulations for New 1996 and Later Heavy-Duty 
Off-Road Diesel Cycle Engines. This procedure has been incorporated by 
reference. See Sec. 89.6; and
    (iii) Part 86, subpart I of this chapter.
    (2) Each test engine must be configured to be representative of 
actual in-use operation. The Administrator may specify the adjustment of 
any adjustable parameter. All test results must be reported to the 
Administrator.
    (b) Confirmatory testing. The Administrator may conduct confirmatory 
testing or other testing on any test engine. The manufacturer must 
deliver test engines as directed by the Administrator. When the 
Administrator conducts confirmatory testing or other testing, those test 
results are used to determine compliance with emission standards.
    (c) Use of carryover test data. In lieu of testing to certify an 
engine family for a given model year, the manufacturer may submit, with 
the Administrator's approval, emission test data used to certify that 
engine family in previous years. This ``carryover'' data is only 
allowable if the submitted test data show that the test engine would 
comply with the emission standard(s) for the model year for which 
certification is being sought.
    (d) Test fuels. EPA may use the fuel specified in either Table 4 or 
Table 5 of appendix A to subpart D of this part in confirmatory testing 
or other testing on any test engine. Emission test results based on use 
of Table 5 fuel will be used to confirm compliance with HC, CO, 
NO<INF>X, PM, and smoke standards. Emission test results based on Table 
4 fuel will be used to confirm compliance with HC, CO, NO<INF>X, and 
smoke standards; when a manufacturer uses the fuel specified in Table 4 
of appendix A to subpart D of this part for its certification testing, 
EPA has the option to use the PM emission result, corrected using the PM 
correction factor specified in Sec. 89.425-96, to confirm compliance 
with the PM standard.


<R05>
Sec. 89.120-96  Compliance with emission standards.

    (a) If all test engines representing an engine family have emissions 
less than or equal to each emission standard, that family complies with 
the emission standards.
    (b) If any test engine representing an engine family has emissions 
greater than each emission standard, that family will be deemed not in 
compliance with the emission standard(s).
    (c) If aftertreatment is employed by an engine family, then a 
deterioration factor must be determined and applied.
    (d) For engine families included in the averaging, banking, and 
trading program, the families' emission limits (FELs) are used in lieu 
of the applicable federal emission standard.


<R05>
Sec. 89.121-96  Certificate of conformity effective dates.

    The certificate of conformity is valid from the date of issuance by 
EPA until 31 December of the model year or calendar year for which it is 
issued.


<R05>
Sec. 89.122-96  Certification.

    (a) If, after a review of the manufacturer's application, request 
for certificate, information obtained from any inspection, and such 
other information as the Administrator may require, the Administrator 
determines that the application is complete and that the engine family 
meets the requirements of this part and the Clean Air Act, the 
Administrator shall issue a certificate of conformity.
    (b) If, after a review of the information described in paragraph (a) 
of this section, the Administrator determines that the requirements of 
this part and the Clean Air Act have not been met, the Administrator 
will deny certification. The Administrator must give a written 
explanation when certification is denied. The manufacturer may request a 
hearing on a denial.

[[Page 51]]


<R05>
Sec. 89.123-96  Amending the application and certificate of conformity.

    (a) The manufacturer of nonroad compression-ignition engines must 
notify the Administrator when changes to information required to be 
described in the application for certification are to be made to a 
product line covered by a certificate of conformity. This notification 
must include a request to amend the application or the existing 
certificate of conformity. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this 
section, the manufacturer shall not make said changes or produce said 
engines prior to receiving approval from EPA.
    (b) A manufacturer's request to amend the application or the 
existing certificate of conformity shall include the following 
information:
    (1) A full description of the change to be made in production or of 
the engine to be added;
    (2) Engineering evaluations or data showing that engines as modified 
or added will comply with all applicable emission standards; and
    (3) A determination whether the manufacturer's original test fleet 
selection is still appropriate, and if the original test fleet selection 
is determined not to be appropriate, proposed test fleet selection(s) 
representing the engines changed or added which would have been required 
if the engines had been included in the original application for 
certification.
    (c) The Administrator may require the manufacturer to perform tests 
on the engine representing the engine to be added or changed.
    (d) Decision by Administrator. (1) Based on the description of the 
proposed amendment and data derived from such testing as the 
Administrator may require or conduct, the Administrator will determine 
whether the proposed change or addition would still be covered by the 
certificate of conformity then in effect.
    (2) If the Administrator determines that the change or new engine(s) 
meets the requirements of this subpart and the Act, the appropriate 
certificate of conformity is amended.
    (3) If the Administrator determines that the changed or new 
engine(s) does not meet the requirements of this subpart and the Act, 
the certificate of conformity will not be amended. The Administrator 
shall provide a written explanation to the manufacturer of the decision 
not to amend the certificate. The manufacturer may request a hearing on 
a denial.
    (e) A manufacturer may make changes in or additions to production 
engines concurrently with notifying the Administrator as required by 
paragraph (a) of this section, if the manufacturer complies with the 
following requirements:
    (1) In addition to the information required in paragraph (b) of this 
section, the manufacturer must supply supporting documentation, test 
data, and engineering evaluations as appropriate to demonstrate that all 
affected engines will still meet applicable emission standards.
    (2) If, after a review, the Administrator determines additional 
testing is required, the manufacturer must provide required test data 
within 30 days or cease production of the affected engines.
    (3) If the Administrator determines that the affected engines do not 
meet applicable requirements, the Administrator will notify the 
manufacturer to cease production of the affected engines and to recall 
and correct at no expense to the owner all affected engines previously 
produced.
    (4) Election to produce engines under this paragraph will be deemed 
to be a consent to recall all engines which the Administrator determines 
do not meet applicable standards and to cause such nonconformity to be 
remedied at no expense to the owner.


<R05>
Sec. 89.124-96  Record retention, maintenance, and submission.

    (a) The manufacturer of any nonroad compression-ignition engine must 
maintain the following adequately organized records:
    (1) Copies of all applications filed with the Administrator.
    (2) A detailed history of each test engine used for certification 
including the following:
    (i) A description of the test engine's construction, including a 
general description of the origin and buildup of the engine, steps taken 
to ensure that

purpose of each test;
    (v) A description of all tests performed to diagnose engine or 
emission control performance, giving the date and time of each and the 
reason(s) for the test; and
    (vi) A description of any significant event(s) affecting the engine 
during the period covered by the history of the test engine but not 
described by an entry under one of the previous paragraphs of this 
section.
    (b) Routine emission test data, such as those reporting test cell 
temperature and relative humidity at start and finish of test and raw 
emission results from each mode or test phase, must be retained for a 
period of one year after issuance of all certificates of conformity to 
which they relate. All other information specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section must be retained for a period of eight years after issuance 
of all certificates of conformity to which they relate.
    (c) Records may be kept in any format and on any media, provided 
that at the Administrator's request, organized, written records in 
English are promptly supplied by the manufacturer.
    (d) The manufacturer must supply, at the Administrator's request, 
copies of any engine maintenance instructions or explanations issued by 
the manufacturer.


<R05>
Sec. 89.125-96  Production engines, annual report.

    (a) Upon the Administrator's request, the manufacturer must supply a 
reasonable number of production engines for testing and evaluation.

    (b) The manufacturer must annually, within 30 days after the end of 
the model year, notify the Administrator of the number of engines 
produced by engine family, by gross power, by displacement, by fuel 
system, or by other categories as the Administrator may require.


<R05>
Sec. 89.126-96  Denial, revocation of certificate of conformity.

    (a) If, after review of the manufacturer's application, request for 
certification, information obtained from any inspection, and any other 
information the Administrator may require, the Administrator determines 
that one or more test engines do not meet applicable standards (or 
family emission limits, as appropriate), then the Administrator will 
notify the manufacturer in writing, setting forth the basis for this 
determination.
    (b) Notwithstanding the fact that engines described in the 
application may comply with all other requirements of this subpart, the 
Administrator may deny the issuance of, suspend, or revoke a previously 
issued certificate of conformity if the Administrator finds any one of 
the following infractions to be substantial:
    (1) The manufacturer submits false or incomplete information;
    (2) The manufacturer denies an EPA enforcement officer or EPA 
authorized representative the opportunity to conduct authorized 
inspections;
    (3) The manufacturer fails to supply requested information or amend 
its application to include all engines being produced;
    (4) The manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data which it 
submits or otherwise circumvents the intent of the Act or this part;
    (5) The manufacturer denies an EPA enforcement officer or EPA 
authorized

[[Page 53]]

representative reasonable assistance (as defined in Sec. 89.129-96(e)).
    (c) If a manufacturer knowingly commits an infraction specified in 
paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(4) of this section, knowingly commits any other 
fraudulent act which results in the issuance of a certificate of 
conformity, or fails to comply with the conditions specified in 
Secs. 89.203-96(f), 89.206-96(d), 89.209-96(c) or 89.210-96(g), the 
Administrator may deem such certificate void ab initio.
    (d) When the Administrator denies, suspends, revokes, or voids ab 
initio a certificate of conformity the manufacturer will be provided a 
written determination. The manufacturer may request a hearing under 
Sec. 89.127-96 on the Administrator's decision.
    (e) Any suspension or revocation of a certificate of conformity 
shall extend no further than to forbid the introduction into commerce of 
engines previously covered by the certification which are still in the 
hands of the manufacturer, except in cases of such fraud or other 
misconduct that makes the certification invalid ab initio.


<R05>
Sec. 89.127-96  Request for hearing.

    (a) A manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's 
denial, suspension, voiding ab initio or revocation of a certificate of 
conformity.
    (b) The manufacturer's request must be filed within 30 days of the 
Administrator's decision, be in writing, and set forth the 
manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's decision and data to 
support the objections.
    (c) If, after review of the request and supporting data, the 
Administrator finds that the request raises a substantial and factual 
issue, the Administrator will grant the manufacturer's request for a 
hearing.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 89.129-96  Right of entry.

    (a) Any manufacturer who has applied for certification of a new 
engine or engine family subject to certification testing under this 
subpart shall admit or cause to be admitted to any of the following 
facilities during operating hours any EPA enforcement officer or EPA 
authorized representative on presentation of credentials.
    (1) Any facility where any such certification testing or any 
procedures or activities connected with such certification testing are 
or were performed;
    (2) Any facility where any new engine which is being, was, or is to 
be tested is present;
    (3) Any facility where any construction process or assembly process 
used in the modification or buildup of such an engine into a 
certification engine is taking place or has taken place; and
    (4) Any facility where any record or other document relating to any 
of the above is located.
    (b) Upon admission to any facility referred to in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section, any EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized 
representative shall be allowed:
    (1) To inspect and monitor any part or aspect of such procedures, 
activities, and testing facilities, including, but not limited to, 
monitoring engine preconditioning, emission tests and service 
accumulation, maintenance, and engine storage procedures, and to verify 
correlation or calibration of test equipment;
    (2) To inspect and make copies of any such records, designs, or 
other documents; and
    (3) To inspect and photograph any part or aspect of any such 
certification engine and any components to be used in the construction 
thereof.
    (c) To allow the Administrator to determine whether production 
engines conform in all material respects to the

[[Page 55]]

design specifications applicable to those engines, as described in the 
application for certification for which a certificate of conformity has 
been issued, any manufacturer shall admit any EPA enforcement officer or 
EPA authorized representative on presentation of credentials to:
    (1) Any facility where any document, design, or procedure relating 
to the translation of the design and construction of engines and 
emission-related components described in the application for 
certification or used for certification testing into production engines 
is located or carried on; and
    (2) Any facility where any engines to be introduced into commerce 
are manufactured or assembled.
    (d) On admission to any such facility referred to in paragraph (c) 
of this section, any EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized 
representative shall be allowed:
    (1) To inspect and monitor any aspects of such manufacture or 
assembly and other procedures;
    (2) To inspect and make copies of any such records, documents or 
designs; and
    (3) To inspect and photograph any part or aspect of any such new 
engines and any component used in the assembly thereof that are 
reasonably related to the purpose of his or her entry.
    (e) Any EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative 
shall be furnished by those in charge of a facility being inspected with 
such reasonable assistance as he or she may request to help the 
enforcement officer or authorized representative discharge any function 
listed in this paragraph. Each applicant for or recipient of 
certification is required to cause those in charge of a facility 
operated for its benefit to furnish such reasonable assistance without 
charge to EPA whether or not the applicant controls the facility.
    (1) Reasonable assistance includes, but is not limited to, clerical, 
copying, interpretation and translation services; the making available 
on request of personnel of the facility being inspected during their 
working hours to inform the EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized 
representative of how the facility operates and to answer the officer's 
questions; and the performance on request of emission tests on any 
engine which is being, has been, or will be used for certification 
testing. Such tests shall be nondestructive, but may require appropriate 
service accumulation.
    (2) A manufacturer may be compelled to cause any employee at a 
facility being inspected to appear before an EPA enforcement officer or 
EPA authorized representative. The request for the employee's appearance 
shall be in writing, signed by the Assistant Administrator for Air and 
Radiation, and served on the manufacturer. Any employee who has been 
instructed by the manufacturer to appear will be entitled to be 
accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel.
    (f) The duty to admit or cause to be admitted any EPA enforcement 
officer or EPA authorized representative applies whether or not the 
applicant owns or controls the facility in question and applies both to 
domestic and to foreign manufacturers and facilities. EPA will not 
attempt to make any inspections which it has been informed that local 
law forbids. However, if local law makes it impossible to do what is 
necessary to ensure the accuracy of data generated at a facility, no 
informed judgment that an engine is certifiable or is covered by a 
certificate can properly be based on those data. It is the 
responsibility of the manufacturer to locate its testing and 
manufacturing facilities in jurisdictions where this situation will not 
arise.
    (g) Any entry without 24 hours prior written or oral notification to 
the affected manufacturer shall be authorized in writing by the 
Assistant Administrator for Enforcement.

          Subpart C--Averaging, Banking, and Trading Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 89.201-96  Applicability.

     Nonroad compression-ignition engines subject to the provisions of 
subpart A of this part are eligible to participate in the averaging, 
banking, and trading program described in this subpart.

[[Page 56]]


<R05>
Sec. 89.202-96  Definitions.

    The definitions in subpart A of this part apply to this subpart. The 
following definitions also apply to this subpart:
     Averaging for nonroad engines means the exchange of emission 
credits among engine families within a given manufacturer's product 
line.
     Banking means the retention of nonroad engine emission credits by 
the manufacturer generating the emission credits for use in future model 
year averaging or trading as permitted by these regulations.
     Emission credits represent the amount of emission reduction or 
exceedance, by a nonroad engine family, below or above the emission 
standard, respectively. Emission reductions below the standard are 
considered as ``positive credits,'' while emission exceedances above the 
standard are considered as ``negative credits.'' In addition, 
``projected credits'' refer to emission credits based on the projected 
applicable production/sales volume of the engine family. ``Reserved 
credits'' are emission credits generated within a model year waiting to 
be reported to EPA at the end of the model year. ``Actual credits'' 
refer to emission credits based on actual applicable production/sales 
volume as contained in the end-of-year reports submitted to EPA. Some or 
all of these credits may be revoked if EPA review of the end-of-year 
reports or any subsequent audit action(s) uncovers problems or errors.
     Trading means the exchange of nonroad engine emission credits 
between manufacturers.


<R05>
Sec. 89.203-96  General provisions.

     (a) The averaging, banking, and trading program for NO<INF>X 
emissions from eligible nonroad engines is described in this subpart. 
Participation in this program is voluntary.
     (b) A nonroad engine family is eligible to participate in the 
averaging, banking, and trading program for NO<INF>X emissions if it is 
subject to regulation under subpart B of this part with certain 
exceptions specified in subsection (c) of this section. No averaging, 
banking, and trading program is available for meeting the HC, CO, PM, or 
smoke emission standards specified in subpart B of this part.
     (c) Nonroad engines may not participate in the averaging, banking, 
and trading program if they are subject to state engine emission 
standards, are exported, or use an alternate or special test procedure 
under Sec. 89.114-96.
     (d) A manufacturer may certify one or more nonroad engine families 
at family emission limits (FELs) above or below the applicable emission 
standard, provided the summation of the manufacturer's projected balance 
of all credit transactions in a given model year is greater than or 
equal to zero, as determined under Sec. 89.207-96.
     (1) FELs for NO<INF>X may not exceed 14.6 grams per kilowatt hour.
     (2) An engine family certified to an FEL is subject to all 
provisions specified in subparts B, D, E, G, H, I, J, and K of this 
part, except that the applicable FEL replaces the NO<INF>X emission 
standard for the family participating in the averaging, banking, and 
trading program.
     (3) A manufacturer of an engine family with an FEL exceeding the 
applicable emission standard must obtain emission credits sufficient to 
address the associated credit shortfall via averaging, banking, or 
trading.
     (4) An engine family with an FEL below the applicable standard may 
generate emission credits for averaging, banking, trading, or a 
combination thereof. Emission credits may not be used to offset an 
engine family's emissions that exceed its applicable FEL. Credits may 
not be used to remedy nonconformity determined by a Selective 
Enforcement Audit (SEA) or by recall (in-use) testing. However, in the 
case of an SEA failure, credits may be used to allow subsequent 
production of engines for the family in question if the manufacturer 
elects to recertify to a higher FEL.
    (e) Credits generated in a given model year may be used in the 
following three model years. Credits not used by the end of the third 
model year after being generated are forfeited. Credits generated in one 
model year may not be used for prior model years.

[[Page 57]]

    (f) Manufacturers must demonstrate compliance under the averaging, 
banking, and trading program for a particular model year by 270 days 
after the model year. Engine families without an adequate amount of 
emission credits will violate the conditions of the certificates of 
conformity. The certificates of conformity may be voided ab initio under 
Sec. 89.126-96(c) for those engine families.


<R05>
Sec. 89.204-96  Averaging.

    (a) A manufacturer may use averaging to offset an emission 
exceedance of a nonroad engine family caused by an FEL above the 
applicable emission standard. Credits used in averaging may be obtained 
from credits generated by another engine family in the same model year, 
credits banked in the three previous model years, or credits obtained 
through trading.
    (b) Credits scheduled to expire in the earliest model year must be 
used first, before using other available credits.


<R05>
Sec. 89.205-96  Banking.

    (a) A manufacturer of a nonroad engine family with an FEL below the 
applicable standard for a given model year may bank credits in that 
model year for use in averaging and trading in the following three model 
years. Credits not withdrawn within the three model years after they are 
banked are forfeited.
    (b) A manufacturer of a nonroad engine family may bank credits up to 
one calendar year prior to the effective date of mandatory 
certification. Such engines must meet the requirements of subparts A, B, 
D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K of this part.
    (c) A manufacturer may bank actual credits only after the end of the 
model year and after EPA has reviewed the manufacturer's end-of-year 
reports. During the model year and before submittal of the end-of-year 
report, credits originally designated in the certification process for 
banking will be considered reserved and may be redesignated for trading 
or averaging in the end-of-year report and final report.
    (d) Credits declared for banking from the previous model year that 
have not been reviewed by EPA may be used in averaging or trading 
transactions. However, such credits may be revoked at a later time 
following EPA review of the end-of-year report or any subsequent audit 
actions.


<R05>
Sec. 89.206-96  Trading.

    (a) A nonroad engine manufacturer may exchange emission credits with 
other nonroad engine manufacturers in trading.
    (b) Credits for trading can be obtained from credits banked in the 
three previous model years or credits generated during the model year of 
the trading transaction. Traded credits expire if they are not used in 
averaging within three model years following the model year in which 
they were generated.
    (c) Traded credits can be used for averaging, banking, or further 
trading transactions.
    (d) In the event of a negative credit balance resulting from a 
transaction, both the buyer and the seller are liable, except in cases 
involving fraud. Certificates of all engine families participating in a 
negative trade may be voided ab initio under Sec. 89.126-96(c).


<R05>
Sec. 89.207-96  Credit calculation.

    For each participating engine family, emission credits (positive or 
negative) are to be calculated according to one of the following 
equations and rounded, in accordance with ASTM E29-90, to the nearest 
one-tenth of a megagram per hour (Mg/hr). ASTM E29-90 has been 
incorporated by reference. See Sec. 89.6. Consistent units are to be 
used throughout the equation.
    (a) For determining credit availability from all engine families 
generating credits:

Emission credits=(Std - FEL)  x  (Volume)  x  (MinPR)  x  (10<SUP>-6)
    (b) For determining credit usage for all engine families requiring 
credits to offset emissions in excess of the standard:

Emission credits= (Std-FEL) x (Volume)  x (MaxPR) x  (10<SUP>-6)

Where:
Std=the current and applicable nonroad engine emission standard in grams 
          per brake horsepower hour.
FEL=the family emission limit for the engine family in grams per brake 
          horsepower hour.

[[Page 58]]

Volume=the number of nonroad engines eligible to participate in the 
          averaging, banking, and trading program within the given 
          engine family during the model year. Quarterly production 
          projections are used for initial certification. Actual 
          applicable production/sales volumes is used for end-of-year 
          compliance determination.
MinPR=the power rating of the configuration within an engine family with 
          the lowest power rating.
MaxPR=the power rating of the configuration within an engine family with 
          the highest power rating.


<R05>
Sec. 89.208-96  Labeling.

    For all nonroad engines included in the averaging, banking, and 
trading program, the family emission limit to which the engine is 
certified must be included on the label required in Sec. 89.110-96.


<R05>

Sec. 89.207-96.
    (5) Submit calculations in accordance with Sec. 89.207-96 of 
projected emission credits (positive or negative) based on quarterly 
production projections for each participating family.
    (6)(i) If the engine family is projected to have negative emission 
credits, state specifically the source (manufacturer/engine family or 
reserved) of the credits necessary to offset the credit deficit 
according to quarterly projected production.
    (ii) If the engine family is projected to generate credits, state 
specifically (manufacturer/engine family or reserved) where the 
quarterly projected credits will be applied.
    (b) All certificates issued are conditional upon manufacturer 
compliance with the provisions of this subpart both during and after the 
model year of production.
    (c) Failure to comply with all provisions of this subpart will be 
considered to be a failure to satisfy the conditions upon which the 
certificate was issued, and the certificate may be deemed void ab 
initio.
    (d) The manufacturer bears the burden of establishing to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator that the conditions upon which the 
certificate was issued were satisfied or waived.
    (e) Projected credits based on information supplied in the 
certification application may be used to obtain a certificate of 
conformity. However, any such credits may be revoked based on review of 
end-of-year reports, follow-up audits, and any other verification steps 
deemed appropriate by the Administrator.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 89.301-96  Scope; applicability.

    (a) This subpart describes the equipment required in order to 
perform exhaust emission tests on new nonroad compression-ignition 
engines subject to the provisions of subpart B of part 89.
    (b) Exhaust gases, either raw or dilute, are sampled while the test 
engine is operated using an 8-mode test cycle on an engine dynamometer. 
The exhaust gases receive specific component analysis determining 
concentration of pollutant, exhaust volume, the fuel flow, and the power 
output during each mode. Emission is reported as grams per kilowatt hour 
(g/kw-hr). See subpart E of this part for a complete description of the 
test procedure.
    (c) General equipment and calibration requirements are given in 
Sec. 89.304-96 through 89.324-96. Sections 89.325-96 through 89.331-96 
set forth general test specifications.
    (d) Additional information about system design, calibration 
methodologies, and so forth, for raw gas sampling can be found in part 
86, subpart D of this chapter. Examples for system design, calibration 
methodologies, and so forth, for dilute exhaust gas sampling can be 
found in part 86, subpart N of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 89.302-96  Definitions.

    The definitions in subpart A of part 89 apply to this subpart. For 
terms not defined in part 89, the definitions in part 86, subparts A, D, 
I, and N apply to this subpart. The following definition also applies to 
this subpart.
    Specific emissions, g/kW-hr, is expressed on the basis of observed 
gross brake power. When it is not possible to test the engine in the 
gross conditions, for example, if the engine and transmission form a 
single integral unit, the engine may be tested in the net condition. 
Power corrections from net to gross conditions will be allowed with 
prior approval of the Administrator.


<R05>

Sec. 89.308-96  Sampling system requirements for gaseous emissions.

    (a) For each component (pump, sample line section, filters, and so 
forth) in the heated portion of the sampling system that has a separate 
source of power or heating element, use engineering judgment to locate 
the coolest portion of that component and monitor the temperature at 
that location. If several components are within an oven, then only the 
surface temperature of the component with the largest thermal mass and 
the oven temperature need be measured.
    (b) If water is removed by condensation, the sample gas temperature 
or sample dewpoint must be monitored either within the water trap or 
downstream. It may not exceed 7  deg.C.


<R05>
Sec. 89.309-96  Analyzers required for gaseous emissions.

advance approval of the Administrator.
    (c) The following requirements must be incorporated in each system 
used for testing under this subpart.
    (1) Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide measurements must be made on 
a dry basis (for raw exhaust measurement only). Specific requirements 
for the means of drying the sample can be found in Sec. 89.309-96(e).
    (2) Calibration or span gases for the NO<INF>X measurement system 
must pass through the NO<INF>2 to NO converter.
    (d) The electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of the equipment must be

including noise to a zero-gas during a 30-second time interval.
    (5) Span drift. The analyzer span drift during a 1-hour period must 
be less than 2 percent of full-scale chart deflection on the lowest 
range used. The analyzer span is defined as the difference between the 
span-response and the zero-response. The span-response is defined as the 
mean response including noise to a span gas during a 30-second time 
interval.
    (b) Operating procedure for analyzers and sampling system. Follow 
the start-up and operating instructions of the instrument manufacturer. 
Adhere to the minimum requirements given in Sec. 89.314-96 to 
Sec. 89.323-96.
    (c) Emission measurement accuracy--Bagged sampling. (1) Good 
engineering practice dictates that exhaust emission sample analyzer 
readings below 15 percent of full-scale chart deflection should 
generally not be used.
    (2) Some high resolution read-out systems, such as computers, data 
loggers, and so forth, can provide sufficient accuracy and resolution 
below 15 percent of full scale. Such systems may be used provided that 
additional calibrations are made to ensure the accuracy of the 
calibration curves. If a gas divider is used, the gas divider must 
conform to the accuracy requirements specified in Sec. 89.312-96(c). The 
following procedure for calibration below 15 percent of full scale may 
be used:
    (i) Span the full analyzer range using a top range calibration gas 
meeting the accuracy requirements of Sec. 89.312-96(c).
    (ii) Generate a calibration curve according to, and meeting the 
requirements of, Secs. 89.319-96 through 89.323-96.
    (iii) Select a calibration gas (a span gas may be used for 
calibrating the CO<INF>2 analyzer) with a concentration midway between 
the two lowest calibration gases or non-zero gas divider increments. 
This gas must be ``named'' to an accuracy of <plus-minus>2.0 percent of 
NIST gas standards, or other standards approved by the Administrator.
    (iv) Using the calibration curve fitted to the points generated in 
paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, check the concentration 
of the gas selected in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. The 
concentration derived from the curve must be within <plus-minus>2.3 
percent (<plus-minus>2.8 percent for CO<INF>2 span gas) of the original 
named gas concentration.
    (v) Provided the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this 
section are met, use the gas divider with the gas selected in paragraph 
(c)(2)(iii) of this section and determine the remainder of the 
calibration points. Fit a calibration curve per Secs. 89.319-96 through 
89.322-96 of this chapter for the entire analyzer range.
    (d) Emission measurement accuracy--continuous sampling. Analyzers 
used for continuous analysis must be operated such that the measured 
concentration

[[Page 64]]

falls between 15 and 100 percent of full-scale chart deflection. 
Exceptions to these limits are:
    (1) The analyzer's response may be less than 15 percent or more than 
100 percent of full scale if automatic range change circuitry is used 
and the limits for range changes are between 15 and 100 percent of full-
scale chart deflection;
    (2) The analyzer's response may be less than 15 percent of full 
scale if:
    (i) Alternative (c)(2) of this section is used to ensure that the 
accuracy of the calibration curve is maintained below 15 percent; or
    (ii) The full-scale value of the range is 155 ppm (or ppmC) or less.

    (3) The true concentration of a span gas must be within 
<plus-minus>2 percent of the NIST gas standard. The true concentration 
of a calibration gas must be within <plus-minus>1 percent of the NIST 
gas standard. The use of precision blending devices (gas dividers) to 
obtain the required calibration gas concentrations is acceptable, 
provided that the blended gases are accurate to within <plus-minus>1.5 
percent of NIST gas standards, or other gas standards which have been 
approved by the Administrator. This accuracy implies that primary gases 
used (or blending) must be ``named'' to an accuracy of at least 
<plus-minus>1 percent, traceable to NIST or other approved gas 
standards. All concentrations of calibration gas shall be given on a 
volume basis (volume percent or volume ppm).

[[Page 65]]

    (4) The gas concentrations used for calibration and span may also be 
obtained by means of a gas divider, either diluting with purified 
N<INF>2 or diluting with purified synthetic air. The accuracy of the 
mixing device must be such that the concentration of the diluted gases 
may be determined to within <plus-minus>2 percent.
    (d) Oxygen interference check gases shall contain propane with 350 
ppmC <plus-minus>75 ppmC hydrocarbon. The concentration value shall be 
determined to calibration gas tolerances by chromatographic analysis of 
total hydrocarbons plus impurities or by dynamic blending. Nitrogen

adjusted to meet the %O<INF>2I requirements. The burner air must contain 
less than 2 ppmC hydrocarbon.


<R05>
Sec. 89.313-96  Initial calibration of analyzers.

    (a) Warming-up time. The warming-up time should be according to the 
recommendations of the manufacturer. If not specified, a minimum of two 
hours shall be allowed for warming up the analyzers.
    (b) NDIR and HFID analyzer. The NDIR analyzer shall be tuned and 
maintained according to the instrument manufacturer's instructions. The 
combustion flame of the HFID analyzer shall be optimized in order to 
meet the specifications in Sec. 89.319-96(b)(2).
    (c) Zero setting and calibration. (1) Using purified synthetic air

    (d) Rechecking of zero setting. The zero setting shall be rechecked 
and the procedure described in paragraph (c) of this section repeated, 
if necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 89.314-96  Pre- and post-test calibration of analyzers.

    Each operating range used during the test shall be checked prior to 
and after each test in accordance with the following procedure. (A 
chronic need for parameter adjustment can indicate a need for instrument 
maintenance.):
    (a) The calibration is checked by using a zero gas and a span gas 
whose nominal value is between 80 percent and 100 percent of full-scale, 
inclusive, of the measuring range.
    (b) After the emission test a zero gas and the same span gas will be 
used for rechecking. The analysis will be considered acceptable if the 
difference between the two measuring results is less than 2 percent of 
full scale.


<R05>
Sec. 89.315-96  Analyzer bench checks.

    (a) Prior to initial use and after major repairs verify that each 
analyzer complies with the specifications given in Table 3 in appendix A 
of this subpart.
    (b) If a stainless steel NO<INF>2 to NO converter is used, condition 
all new or replacement converters. The conditioning consists of either 
purging the converter with air for a minimum of 4 hours or until the 
converter efficiency is greater than 90 percent. The converter must be 
at operational temperature while purging. Do not use this procedure 
prior to checking converter efficiency on in-use converters.


<R05>
Sec. 89.316-96  Analyzer leakage and response time.

    (a) Vacuum side leak check. (1) Any location within the analysis 
system where a vacuum leak could affect the test results must be 
checked.
    (2) The maximum allowable leakage rate on the vacuum side is 0.5 
percent of the in-use flow rate for the portion

[[Page 66]]

of the system being checked. The analyzer flows and bypass flows may be 
used to estimate the in-use flow rates.
    (3) The sample probe and the connection between the sample probe and 
valve V2 (see Figure 1 in appendix B of this subpart) may be excluded 
from the leak check.
    (b) Pressure side leak check. The maximum allowable leakage rate on 
the pressure side is 5 percent of the in-use flow rate.
    (c) The response time shall be accounted for in all emission 
measurement and calculations.


<R05>
Sec. 89.317-96  NO<INF>X converter check.

    (a) Prior to its introduction into service, and monthly thereafter, 
the chemiluminescent oxides of nitrogen analyzer shall be checked for 
NO<INF>2 to NO converter efficiency. Figure 2 in appendix B of this 
subpart is a reference for the following paragraphs.
    (b) Follow good engineering practices for instrument start-up and 
operation. Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance.
    (c) Zero the oxides of nitrogen analyzer with zero-grade air or 
zero-grade nitrogen.
    (d) Connect the outlet of the NO<INF>X generator to the sample inlet 
of the oxides of nitrogen analyzer which has been set to the most common 
operating range.
    (e) Introduce into the NO<INF>X generator analyzer-system an NO-in-
nitrogen (N<INF>2) mixture with an NO concentration equal to 
approximately 80 percent of the most common operating range. The 
NO<INF>2 content of the gas mixture shall be less than 5 percent of the 
NO concentration.
    (f) With the oxides of nitrogen analyzer in the NO mode, record the 
concentration of NO indicated by the analyzer.
    (g) Turn on the NO<INF>X generator O<INF>2 (or air) supply and 
adjust the O<INF>2 (or air) flow rate so that the NO indicated by the 
analyzer is about 10 percent less than indicated in paragraph (b)(5) of 
this section. Record the concentration of NO in this NO+O<INF>2 mixture.
    (h) Switch the NO<INF>X generator to the generation mode and adjust 
the generation rate so that the NO measured on the analyzer is 20 
percent of that measured in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. There must 
be at least 10 percent unreacted NO at this point. Record the 
concentration of residual NO.
    (i) Switch the oxides of nitrogen analyzer to the NO<INF>X mode and 
measure total NO<INF>X. Record this value.
    (j) Switch off the NO<INF>X generator but maintain gas flow through 
the system. The oxides of nitrogen analyzer will indicate the NO<INF>X 
in the NO+O<INF>2 mixture. Record this value.
    (k) Turn off the NO<INF>X generator O<INF>2 (or air) supply. The 
analyzer will now indicate the NO<INF>X in the original NO-in-N<INF>2 
mixture. This value should be no more than 5 percent above the value 
indicated in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (l) Calculate the efficiency of the NO<INF>X converter by 
substituting the concentrations obtained into the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JN94.000

Where:
a=concentration obtained in paragraph (i),
b=concentration obtained in paragraph (j),
c=concentration obtained in paragraph (g),
d=concentration obtained in paragraph (h).

    If converter efficiency is not greater than 90 percent, corrective 
action will be required.


<R05>
Sec. 89.318-96  Analyzer interference checks.

    (a) Gases present in the exhaust other than the one being analyzed 
can interfere with the reading in several ways. Positive interference 
occurs in

[[Page 67]]

NDIR and PMD instruments when the interfering gas gives the same effect 
as the gas being measured, but to a lesser degree. Negative interference 
occurs in NDIR instruments by the interfering gas broadening the 
absorption band of the measured gas and in CLD instruments by the 
interfering gas quenching the radiation. The interference checks 
described in this section are to be made initially and after any major 
repairs that could affect analyzer performance.
    (b) CO analyzer water and CO<INF>2 interference checks. Prior to its 
introduction into service and annually thereafter, the NDIR carbon 
monoxide analyzer shall be checked for response to water vapor and 
CO<INF>2:
    (1) Follow good engineering practices for instrument start-up and 
operation. Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance on the most 
sensitive range to be used.
    (2) Zero the carbon monoxide analyzer with either zero-grade air or 
zero-grade nitrogen.
    (3) Bubble a mixture of 3 percent CO<INF>2 in N<INF>2 through water 
at room temperature and record analyzer response.
    (4) An analyzer response of more than 1 percent of full scale for 
ranges above 300 ppm full scale or more than 3 ppm on ranges below 300 
ppm full scale requires corrective action. (Use of conditioning columns 
is one form of corrective action which may be taken.)
    (c) NO<INF>X analyzer quench check. The two gases of concern for CLD 
(and HCLD) analyzers are CO<INF>2 and water vapor. Quench responses to 
these two gases are proportional to their concentrations and, therefore, 
require test techniques to determine quench at the highest expected 
concentrations experienced during testing.
    (1) NO<INF>X analyzer CO<INF>2 quench check. A CO<INF>2 span gas 
having a concentration of 80 percent to 100 percent of full scale of the 
maximum operating range used during testing shall be passed through the 
CO<INF>2 NDIR analyzer and the value recorded as a. It is diluted 
approximately 50 percent with NO span gas and then passed through the 
CO<INF>2 NDIR and CLD (or HCLD), with the CO<INF>2 and NO values 
recorded as b and c respectively. The CO<INF>2 shall then be shut off 
and only the NO span gas passed through the CLD (or HCLD) and the NO 
value recorded as d. Percent CO<INF>2 quench shall be calculated as 
follows and shall not exceed 3 percent:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JN94.001

Where:
a=Undiluted CO<INF>2 concentration (percent)
b=Diluted CO2 concentration (percent)
c=Diluted NO concentration (ppm)
d=Undiluted NO concentration (ppm)
    (2) NO<INF>X analyzer water quench check. (i) This check applies to 
wet measurements only. An NO span gas having a concentration of 80 
percent to 100 percent of full scale of a normal operating range shall 
be passed through the CLD (or HCLD) and the response recorded as D. The 
NO span gas shall then be bubbled through water at room temperature and 
passed through the CLD (or HCLD) and the analyzer response recorded as 
AR. Determine and record the analyzer absolute operating pressure and 
the bubbler water temperature. (It is important that the NO span gas 
contains minimal NO<INF>2 concentration for this check. No allowance for 
absorption of NO<INF>2 in water has been made in the following quench 
calculations.)
    (ii) Calculations for water quench must consider dilution of the NO 
span gas with water vapor and scaling of the water vapor concentration 
of the mixture to that expected during testing. Determine the mixture's 
saturated vapor pressure (designated as Pwb) that corresponds to the 
bubbler water temperature. Calculate the water concentration (Z1, 
percent) in the mixture by the following equation:


[[Page 68]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JN94.002


where GP = analyzer operating pressure (Pa)

    (iii) Calculate the expected dilute NO span gas and water vapor 
mixture concentration (designated as D1) by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JN94.003

    (iv) For diesel (compression-ignition) exhaust, the maximum raw or 
dilute exhaust water vapor concentration expected during testing 
(designated as Wm) can be estimated from the CO<INF>2 span gas 
(designated as A) criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the 
assumption of a fuel atom H/C ratio of 1.8:1 as:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JN94.004

Where:
A = undiluted CO<INF>2 concentration.

    Percent water quench shall not exceed 3 percent and shall be 
calculated by:

Sec. 89.319-96  Hydrocarbon analyzer calibration.

    (a) The FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall receive the initial and 
periodic calibration as described in this section. The HFID used with 
petroleum-fueled diesel (compression-ignition) engines shall be operated 
to a set point <plus-minus>5.5  deg.C between 185 and 197  deg.C.
    (b) Initial and periodic optimization of detector response. Prior to 
introduction into service and at least annually thereafter, adjust the 
FID hydrocarbon analyzer for optimum hydrocarbon response as specified 
in this paragraph. Alternate methods yielding equivalent results may be 
used, if approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (1) Follow good engineering practices for initial instrument start-
up and basic operating adjustment using the appropriate fuel (see 
Sec. 89.312-96(e)) and zero-grade air.
    (2) One of the following procedures is required for FID or HFID 
optimization:
    (i) The procedure outlined in Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) 
paper No. 770141, ``Optimization of a Flame Ionization Detector for 
Determination of Hydrocarbon in Diluted Automotive Exhausts''; author, 
Glenn D. Reschke. This procedure has been incorporated by reference. See 
Sec. 89.6.
    (ii) The HFID optimization procedures outlined in Sec. 86.331-79 of 
this chapter.
    (iii) Alternative procedures may be used if approved in advance by 
the Administrator.
    (3) After the optimum flow rates have been determined, record them 
for future reference.
    (c) Initial and periodic calibration. Prior to introduction into 
service and monthly thereafter, the FID or HFID hydrocarbon analyzer 
shall be calibrated on all normally used instrument ranges using the 
steps in this paragraph. Use the same flow rate and pressures as when 
analyzing samples. Calibration gases shall be introduced directly at the 
analyzer, unless the ``overflow'' calibration option of Sec. 86.1310-
90(b)(3)(i) of this chapter for the HFID is taken.
    (1) Adjust analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the hydrocarbon analyzer with zero-grade air.
    (3) Calibrate on each used operating range with propane-in-air 
(dilute) or propane-in-nitrogen (raw) calibration gases having nominal 
concentrations starting between 10-15 percent and increasing in at least 
six incremental steps to 90 percent of that range. The incremental steps 
are to be spaced to represent good engineering practice. For each range 
calibrated, if the deviation from a least-squares best-fit straight line 
is 2 percent or less of the value at each data point, concentration 
values may be calculated by use of a single calibration factor for that 
range. If the deviation exceeds 2 percent at

[[Page 69]]

any point, the best-fit non-linear equation which represents the data to 
within 2 percent of each test point shall be used to determine 
concentration.
    (d) Oxygen interference optimization. Choose a range where the 
oxygen interference check gases will fall in the upper 50 percent. 
Conduct the test, as outlined in this paragraph, with the oven 
temperature set as required by the instrument manufacturer. Oxygen 
interference check gas specifications are found in Sec. 89.312-96(d).
    (1) Zero the analyzer.
    (2) Span the analyzer with the purified synthetic air specified in 
Sec. 89.312-96(b)(4).
    (3) Recheck zero response. If it has changed more than 0.5 percent 
of full scale repeat paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section to 
correct problem.
    (4) Introduce the 5 percent and 10 percent oxygen interference check 
gases.
    (5) Recheck the zero response. If it has changed more <plus-minus>1 
percent of full scale, repeat the test.
    (6) Calculate the percent of oxygen interference (designated as 
percent O<INF>2I) for each mixture in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JN94.006

A=hydrocarbon concentration (ppmC) of the span gas used in paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section.
B=hydrocarbon concentration (ppmC) of the oxygen interference check 
gases used in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JN94.007

D=percent of full-scale analyzer response due to A.

    (7) The percent of oxygen interference (designated as %O<INF>2I) 
must be less than <plus-minus> 3.0 percent for all required oxygen 
interference check gases prior to testing.
    (8) If the oxygen interference is greater than the specifications, 
incrementally adjust the air flow above and below the manufacturer's 
specifications, repeating paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(7) of this 
section for each flow.
    (9) If the oxygen interference is greater than the specification 
after adjusting the air flow, vary the fuel flow and thereafter the 
sample flow, repeating paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(7) of this section 
for each new setting.
    (10) If the oxygen interference is still greater than the 
specifications, repair or replace the analyzer, FID fuel, or burner air 
prior to testing. Repeat this section with the repaired or replaced 
equipment or gases.

monoxide analyzer shall be checked for response to water vapor and 
CO<INF>2 in accordance with Sec. 318.96(b).
    (c) Initial and periodic calibration. Prior to its introduction into 
service and monthly thereafter, the NDIR carbon monoxide analyzer shall 
be calibrated.
    (1) Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the carbon monoxide analyzer with either zero-grade air or 
zero-grade nitrogen.
    (3) Calibrate on each used operating range with carbon monoxide-in-
N<INF>2 calibration gases having nominal concentrations starting between 
10 and 15 percent and increasing in at least six incremental steps to 90 
percent of that range. The incremental steps are to be spaced to 
represent good engineering practice. For each range calibrated, if the 
deviation from a least-squares best-fit straight line is 2 percent or 
less of the value at each data point, concentration values may be 
calculated by use of a single calibration factor for that range. If the 
deviation exceeds 2 percent at any point, the best-fit non-linear 
equation which represents the data to within 2 percent of each test 
point shall be used to determine concentration.

N<INF>2 calibration gases with nominal concentrations starting at 
between 10 and 15 percent and increasing in at least six incremental 
steps to 90 percent of that range. The incremental steps are to be 
spaced to represent good engineering practice. For each range 
calibrated, if the deviation from a least-squares best-fit straight line 
is 2 percent or less of the value at each data point, concentration 
values may be calculated by use of a single calibration factor for that 
range. If the deviation exceeds 2 percent at any point, the best-fit 
non-linear equation which represents the data to within 2 percent of 
each test point shall be used to determine concentration.
    (d) The initial and periodic interference, system check, and 
calibration test procedures specified in part 86, subpart D of this

Sec. 89.322-96  Carbon dioxide analyzer calibration.

    (a) Prior to its introduction into service, and monthly thereafter, 
the NDIR carbon dioxide analyzer shall be calibrated as follows:
    (1) Follow good engineering practices for instrument start-up and 
operation. Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the carbon dioxide analyzer with either zero-grade air or 
zero-grade nitrogen.
    (3) Calibrate on each normally used operating range with carbon 
dioxide-in-N<INF>2 calibration or span gases having nominal 
concentrations starting between 10 and 15 percent and increasing in at 
least six incremental steps to 90 percent of that range. The incremental 
steps are to be spaced to represent good engineering practice. For each 
range calibrated, if the deviation from a least-squares best-fit 
straight line is 2 percent or less of the value at each data point, 
concentration values may be calculated by use of a single calibration 
factor for that range. If the deviation exceeds 2 percent at any point, 
the best-fit non-linear equation which represents the data to within 2 
percent of each test point shall be used to determine concentration.
    (b) The initial and periodic interference, system check, and 
calibration test procedures specified in part 86, subpart D of this 
chapter may be used in lieu of the procedures in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 89.323-96  NDIR analyzer calibration.

    (a) Detector optimization. If necessary, follow the instrument 
manufacturer's instructions for initial start-up and basic operating 
adjustments.
    (b) Calibration curve. Develop a calibration curve for each range 
used as follows:
    (1) Zero the analyzer.
    (2) Span the analyzer to give a response of approximately 90 percent 
of full-scale chart deflection.
    (3) Recheck the zero response. If it has changed more than 0.5 
percent of full scale, repeat the steps given in paragraphs (b)(1) and 
(b)(2) of this section.
    (4) Record the response of calibration gases having nominal 
concentrations starting between 10 and 15 percent and increasing in at 
least six incremental steps to 90 percent of that range. The incremental 
steps are to be spaced to represent good engineering practice.
    (5) Generate a calibration curve. The calibration curve shall be of 
fourth

[[Page 71]]

order or less, have five or fewer coefficients. If any range is within 2 
percent of being linear a linear calibration may be used. Include zero 
as a data point. Compensation for known impurities in the zero gas can 
be made to the zero-data point. The calibration curve must fit the data 
points within 2 percent of point.
    (6) Optional. A new calibration curve need not be generated if:
    (i) A calibration curve conforming to paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section exists; or
    (ii) The responses generated in paragraph (b)(4) of this section are 
within 1 percent of full scale or 2 percent of point, whichever is less, 
of the responses predicted by the calibration curve for the gases used 
in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (7) If multiple range analyzers are used, the lowest range used must 
meet the curve fit requirements below 15 percent of full scale.


<R05>
Sec. 89.324-96  Calibration of other equipment.

    Other test equipment used for testing shall be calibrated as often 
as required by the instrument manufacturer or as necessary according to 
good practice.


<R05>
Sec. 89.325-96  Engine intake air temperature measurement.

    (a) Engine intake air temperature measurement must be made within 
122 cm of the engine. The measurement location must be made either in 
the supply system or in the air stream entering the supply system.
    (b) The temperature measurements shall be accurate to within 
<plus-minus>2  deg.C.


<R05>
Sec. 89.326-96  Engine intake air humidity measurement.

    (a) Humidity conditioned air supply. Air that has had its absolute 
humidity altered is considered humidity- conditioned air. For this type 
of intake air supply, the humidity measurements must be made within the 
intake air supply system and after the humidity conditioning has taken 
place.
    (b) Nonconditioned air supply procedure. Humidity measurements in 
nonconditioned intake air supply systems must be made in the intake air 
stream entering the supply system. Alternatively, the humidity 
measurements can be measured within the intake air supply stream.


<R05>
Sec. 89.327-96  Charge cooling.

    For engines with an air-to-air intercooler (or any other low 
temperature charge air cooling device) between the turbocharger 
compressor and the intake manifold, follow SAE J1937. This procedure has 
been incorporated by reference. See Sec. 89.6. The temperature of the 
cooling medium and the temperature of the charge air shall be monitored 
and recorded.


<R05>
Sec. 89.328-96  Inlet and exhaust restrictions.

    (a) The manufacturer is liable for emission compliance over the full 
range of restrictions that are specified by the manufacturer for that 
particular engine.
    (b) Perform testing at the following inlet and exhaust restriction 
settings.
    (1) Equip the test engine with an air inlet system presenting an air 
inlet restriction at the upper limit at maximum air flow, as specified 
by the engine manufacturer for a clean air cleaner. A system 
representative of the installed engine may be used. In other cases a 
test shop system may be used.
    (2) The exhaust backpressure must be at the upper limit at maximum 
declared power, as specified by the engine manufacturer. A system 
representative of the installed engine may be used. In other cases a 
test shop system may be used.


<R05>
Sec. 89.329-96  Engine cooling system.

    An engine cooling system is required with sufficient capacity to 
maintain the engine at normal operating temperatures as prescribed by 
the engine manufacturer.


<R05>
Sec. 89.330-96  Lubricating oil and test fuels.

    (a) Lubricating oil. Use the engine lubricating oil for testing that 
meets the requirements as specified by the manufacturer for a particular 
engine and intended usage. Record the specifications of the lubricating 
oil used for the test.
    (b) Test fuels. (1) Use diesel fuels for testing which are clean and 
bright, with pour and cloud points adequate

[[Page 72]]

for operability. The diesel fuel may contain nonmetallic additives as 
follows: Cetane improver, metal deactivator, antioxidant, dehazer, 
antirust, pour depressant, dye, dispersant, and biocide.
    (2) Use only petroleum fuel meeting the specifications in Table 4 in 
appendix A of this subpart, or substantially equivalent specifications 
approved by the Administrator, for exhaust emission testing. 
Alternatively, petroleum fuel meeting the specifications in Table 5 in 
appendix A of this subpart may be used in exhaust emission testing. The 
grade of diesel fuel used must be commercially designated as ``Type 2-
D'' grade diesel fuel and recommended by the engine manufacturer. If the 
fuel specified in Table 4 in Appendix A of this subpart is used, the 
adjustment factor specified in Sec. 89.425-96 may be applied to 
particulate emission values to account for the impact of sulfur in fuel 
on particulate emissions.
    (c) Other fuels may be used for testing provided they meet the 
following qualifications:
    (1) They are commercially available;
    (2) Information acceptable to the Administrator is provided to show 
that only the designated fuel would be used in customer service;
    (3) Use of a fuel listed under paragraph (b) of this section would 
have a detrimental effect on emissions or durability; and
    (4) Fuel specifications are approved in writing by the Administrator 
prior to the start of testing.
    (d) Report the specification range of the fuel to be used under 
paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section in the 
application for certification in accordance with Sec. 89.115-96 (a)(8).

               Subpart E--Exhaust Emission Test Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 89.401-96  Scope; applicability.

    (a) This subpart describes the procedures to follow in order to 
perform exhaust emission tests on new nonroad compression-ignition 
engines subject to the provisions of subpart B of this part.
    (b) Exhaust gases, either raw or dilute, are sampled while the test 
engine is operated using an 8-mode test cycle on an engine dynamometer. 
The exhaust gases receive specific component analysis determining 
concentration of pollutant, exhaust volume, the fuel flow, and the power 
output during each mode. Emission is reported as grams per kilowatt hour 
(g/kW-hr).
    (c) Requirements for emission test equipment and calibrating this 
equipment are found in subpart D of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 89.402-96  Definitions.

    The definitions in subpart A of this part apply to this subpart. For 
terms not defined in this part, the definitions in part 86, subparts A, 
D, I, and N of this chapter apply to this subpart. The following 
definition also applies to this subpart.
    Specific emissions, (g/kW-hr), shall be expressed on the basis of 
observed gross power.
    When it is not possible to test the engine in the gross conditions, 
for example, if the engine and transmission form a single integral unit, 
the engine may be tested in the net condition. Power corrections from 
net to gross conditions will be allowed with prior approval of the 
Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 89.403-96  Symbols/abbreviations.

    (a) The abbreviations in Sec. 86.094-3 or Sec. 89.3 of this chapter 
apply to this subpart.
    (b) The abbreviations in Table 1 in appendix A to subpart D also 
apply to this subpart. Some abbreviations from Sec. 89.3 have been 
included for the convenience of the reader.
    (c) The symbols in Table 2 in appendix A to subpart D apply to this 
subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 89.404-96  Test procedure overview.

    (a) The test consists of prescribed sequences of engine operating 
conditions to be conducted on an engine dynamometer. The exhaust gases, 
generated raw or dilute during engine operation, are sampled for 
specific component analysis through the analytical train. The test is 
applicable to engines equipped with catalytic or direct-flame 
afterburners, induction system modifications, or other systems, or to 
uncontrolled engines.
    (b) The test is designed to determine the brake-specific emissions 
of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen. The test 
consists of one idle mode, four power modes at one speed and three power 
modes at another speed. These procedures require the determination of 
the concentration of each pollutant, exhaust volume, the fuel flow, and 
the power output during each mode. The measured values are weighted and 
used to calculate the grams of each pollutant emitted per kilowatt hour 
(g/kW-hr).
    (c)(1) When an engine is tested for exhaust emissions, the complete 
engine shall be tested with all emission control devices installed and 
functioning.
    (2) On air-cooled engines, the fan shall be installed.
    (3) Additional accessories (for example, oil cooler, alternators, or 
air compressors) may be installed but such accessory loading will be 
considered parasitic in nature and observed power shall be used in the 
emission calculation.
    (d) All emission control systems installed on or incorporated in the 
application must be functioning during all procedures in this subpart. 
In cases of component malfunction or failure, maintenance to correct 
component failure or malfunction must be authorized in accordance with 
Sec. 86.094-25 of this chapter.
    (e) The engine must be equipped with an electrical generation device 
typical of one used in customer service (such as an alternator). The 
power drain from it must be no greater than what is sufficient to 
operate the engine on the test stand.

[[Page 79]]

line, filters, and pumps to reach operating temperature.
    (c) Perform the following system checks:
    (1) Check the sample-line temperature (see Sec. 86.310-79 of this 
chapter for raw test procedures or Sec. 86.1310-90 of this chapter for 
dilute test procedures).
    (2) Check that the system response time has been accounted for prior 
to sample collection data recording.
    (3) A hang-up check is permitted, but is optional.
    (d) Check analyzer zero and span at a minimum before and after each 
test. Further, check analyzer zero and span any time a range change is 
made or at the maximum demonstrated time span for stability for each 
analyzer used.
    (e) Check system flow rates and pressures.


<R05>
Sec. 89.407-96  Engine dynamometer test run.

    (a) Measure and record the temperature of the air supplied to the 
engine, the fuel temperature at the pump inlet, and the observed 
barometric pressure.
    (b) The governor and fuel system shall have been adjusted to provide 
engine performance at the levels reported in the application for 
certification required under Sec. 89.115-96.
    (c) The following steps are taken for each test:
    (1) Install instrumentation and sample probes as required.
    (2) Perform the pre-test procedure as specified in Sec. 89.406-96.
    (3) Read and record the general test data as specified in 
Sec. 89.405-96(c).
    (4) Start cooling system.
    (5) Precondition (warm up) the engine in the following manner:
    (i) Operate the engine at idle for 2 to 3 minutes;
    (ii) Operate the engine at approximately 50 percent power at the 
peak torque speed for 5 to 7 minutes;
    (iii) Operate the engine at rated speed and maximum horsepower for 
25 to 30 minutes;
    (iv) Optional. It is permitted to precondition the engine at rated 
speed and maximum horsepower until the oil and water temperatures are 
stabilized. The temperatures are defined as stabilized if they are 
maintained within <plus-minus>2  deg.C for 2 minutes. The engine must be 
operated a minimum of 10 minutes for this option. This optional 
procedure may be substituted for the procedure in paragraph (c)(5)(iii) 
of this section;
    (v) Optional. If the engine has been operating on service 
accumulation for a minimum of 40 minutes, the service accumulation may 
be substituted for the procedure in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) through (iii) 
of this section.
    (6) Read and record all pre-test data specified in Sec. 89.405-
96(d).
    (7) Start the test cycle (see Sec. 89.410-96) within 20 minutes of 
the end of the warmup. (See paragraph (c)(13) of this section.)
    (8) During the first mode calculate the torque corresponding to 75, 
50, and 10 percent of the maximum observed torque for the rated speed.
    (9) During the fifth mode calculate the torque corresponding to 75 
and 50 percent of the maximum observed torque for the intermediate 
speed.
    (10) Record all modal data specified in Sec. 89.405-96(e) during a 
minimum of the last 60 seconds of each mode.
    (11) Record the analyzer(s) response to the exhaust gas during the a 
minimum of the last 60 seconds of each mode.
    (12) Test modes may be repeated, as long as the engine is 
preconditioned by running the previous mode.
    (13) If a delay of more than 20 minutes occurs between the end of 
one mode and the beginning of another mode, the test is void. If the 
delay is under four hours, the test may be restarted without 
preconditioning (begin at the point in the procedure described at 
paragraph (c)(6) of this section). If the delay exceeds 4 hours, the 
test shall include preconditioning (begin at paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section).
    (14) The engine speed and torque must be measured within the 
accuracy requirements of Table 3 (in appendix A to subpart D), and 
maintained within the requirements of Table 1 (in appendix B to this 
subpart) during a minimum of the last 60 seconds of each mode.
    (15) If at any time during a test mode, the test equipment 
malfunctions or the specifications in paragraph (c)(14) of this section 
are not met, the test mode is void and may be aborted.

[[Page 80]]

The test mode may be restarted without preconditioning (begin with 
paragraph (c)(6) of this section).
    (16) Fuel flow and air flow during the idle load condition may be 
determined just prior to or immediately following the dynamometer 
sequence, if longer times are required for accurate measurements.
    (d) Exhaust gas measurements. (1) Measure HC, CO, CO<INF>2, and 
NO<INF>X concentration in the exhaust sample.
    (2) Each analyzer range that may be used during a test mode must 
have the zero and span responses recorded prior to the execution of that 
test mode. Only the zero and span for the range(s) used to measure the 
emissions during a test mode are required to be recorded after the 
completion of the test mode.
    (3) It is permissible to change filter elements between test modes.
    (4) A leak check is permitted between test segments.
    (5) A hangup check is permitted between test segments.
    (6) If, during the emission measurement portion of a test segment, 
the value of the gauges downstream of the NDIR analyzer(s) G3 or G4 (see 
Figure 1 in appendix B to subpart D) differs by more than 
<plus-minus>0.5 kPa from the pretest value, the test segment is void.


<R05>
Sec. 89.408-96  Post-test procedures.

    (a) A hangup check is recommended at the completion of the last test 
mode using the following procedure:
    (1) Within 30 seconds introduce a zero-grade gas or room air into 
the sample probe or valve V2 (see Figure 1 in appendix B to subpart D) 
to check the ``hangup zero'' response. Simultaneously start a time 
measurement.
    (2) Select the lowest HC range used during the test.
    (3) Within four minutes of beginning the time measurement in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the difference between the span-zero 
response and the hangup zero response shall not be greater than 5.0 
percent of full scale or 10 ppmC whichever is greater.
    (b) Begin the analyzer span checks within 6 minutes after the 
completion of the last mode in the test. Record for each analyzer the 
zero and span response for each range used during the preceding test or 
test segment.
    (c) If during the test, the filter element(s) were replaced or 
cleaned, a vacuum check must be performed per Sec. 89.316-96(a) 
immediately after the span checks. If the vacuum side leak check does 
not meet the requirements of Sec. 89.316-96(a), the test is void.
    (d) Record the post-test data specified in Sec. 89.405-96(f).
    (e) For a valid test, the analyzer drift between the before-mode and 
after-mode span checks for each analyzer must meet the following 
requirements:
    (1) The span drift (defined as the change in the difference between 
the zero response and the span response) must not exceed 2 percent of 
full-scale chart deflection for each range used.
    (2) The zero response drift must not exceed 2 percent of full-scale 
chart deflection for each range used above 155 ppm (or ppmC) or 3 
percent of full-scale chart deflection for each range below 155 ppm (or 
ppmC).


<R05>
Sec. 89.409-96  Data logging.

    (a) A computer or any other automatic data processing device(s) may 
be used as long as the system meets the requirements of this subpart.
    (b) Determine from the data collection records the analyzer 
responses corresponding to the end of each mode.
    (c) Record data at a minimum of once every 5 seconds.
    (d) Determine the final value for CO<INF>2, CO, HC, and NO<INF>X 
concentrations by averaging the concentration of each point taken during 
the sample period for each mode.
    (e) For purposes of this section, calibration data includes 
calibration curves, linearity curves, span-gas responses, and zero-gas 
responses.


<R05>
Sec. 89.410-96  Engine test cycle.

    (a) The 8-mode cycle (see Table 1 in appendix B to this subpart) 
shall be followed in dynamometer operation tests of compression-ignition 
nonroad engines.
    (b) During each non-idle mode, hold the specified speed and load to 
within <plus-minus>2 percent of point. During each idle mode, speed must 
be held within the manufacturer's specifications for the engine, and the 
throttle must be in the fully closed position and torque must

[[Page 81]]

not exceed 5 percent of the peak torque value of mode 5.
    (c) If the operating conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section for modes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 cannot be maintained, the 
Administrator may authorize deviations from the specified load 
conditions. Such deviations shall not exceed 10 percent of the maximum 
torque at the test speed. The minimum deviations, above and below the 
specified load, necessary for stable operation shall be determined by 
the manufacturer and approved by the Administrator prior to the test 
run.
    (d) Power generated during the idle mode may not be included in the 
calculation of emission results.


<R05>
Sec. 89.411-96  Exhaust sample procedure--gaseous components.

    (a) Automatic data collection equipment requirements. The analyzer 
response may be read by automatic data collection (ADC) equipment such 
as computers, data loggers, and so forth. If ADC equipment is used, the 
following is required:
    (1) For bag sample analysis, the analyzer response must be stable at 
greater than 99 percent of the final reading for the dilute exhaust 
sample bag. A single value representing the average chart deflection 
over a 10-second stabilized period shall be stored.
    (2) For continuous analysis systems, a single value representing the 
average integrated concentration over a cycle shall be stored.
    (3) The chart deflections or average integrated concentrations 
required in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section may be stored 
on long-term computer storage devices such as computer tapes, storage 
discs, punch cards, and so forth, or they may be printed in a listing 
for storage. In either case a chart recorder is not required and records 
from a chart recorder, if they exist, need not be stored.
    (4) If ADC equipment is used to interpret analyzer values, the ADC 
equipment is subject to the calibration specifications of the analyzer 
as if the ADC equipment is part of analyzer system.
    (b) Data records from any one or a combination of analyzers may be 
stored as chart recorder records.
    (c) Bag sample analysis. For bag sample analysis perform the 
following sequence:
    (1) Warm up and stabilize the analyzers; clean and/or replace filter 
elements, conditioning columns (if used), and so forth, as necessary.
    (2) Obtain a stable zero reading.
    (3) Zero and span the analyzers with zero and span gases. The span 
gases must have concentrations between 75 and 100 percent of full-scale 
chart deflection. The flow rates and system pressures during spanning 
shall be approximately the same as those encountered during sampling. A 
sample bag may be used to identify the required analyzer range.
    (4) Recheck zero response. If this zero response differs from the 
zero response recorded in paragraph (c)(3) of this section by more than 
1 percent of full scale, then paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of 
this section must be repeated.
    (5) If a chart recorder is used, identify and record the most recent 
zero and span response as the pre-analysis values.
    (6) If ADC equipment is used, electronically record the most recent 
zero and span response as the pre-analysis values.
    (7) Measure HC, CO, CO<INF>2, and NO<INF>X background concentrations 
in the sample bag(s) with approximately the same flow rates and 
pressures used in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. (Constituents 
measured continuously do not require bag analysis.)
    (8) A post-analysis zero and span check of each range must be 
performed and the values recorded. The number of events that may occur 
between the pre- and post-analysis checks is not specified. However, the 
difference between pre-analysis zero and span values (recorded in 
paragraph (c)(5) or (c)(6) of this section) versus those recorded for 
the post-analysis check may not exceed the zero drift limit or the span 
drift limit of 2 percent of full-scale chart deflection for any range 
used. Otherwise the test is void.
    (d) Continuous sample analysis. For continuous sample analysis 
perform the following sequence:

[[Page 82]]

    (1) Warm up and stabilize the analyzers; clean and/or replace filter 
elements, conditioning columns (if used), and so forth, as necessary.
    (2) Leak check portions of the sampling system that operate at 
negative gauge pressures when sampling, and allow heated sample lines, 
filters, pumps, and so forth to stabilize at operating temperature.
    (3) Optional: Perform a hangup check for the HFID sampling system:
    (i) Zero the analyzer using zero air introduced at the analyzer 
port.
    (ii) Flow zero air through the overflow sampling system. Check the 
analyzer response.
    (iii) If the overflow zero response exceeds the analyzer zero 
response by 2 percent or more of the HFID full-scale deflection, hangup 
is indicated and corrective action must be taken.
    (iv) The complete system hangup check specified in paragraph (e) of 
this section is recommended as a periodic check.
    (4) Obtain a stable zero reading.
    (5) Zero and span each range to be used on each analyzer operated 
prior to the beginning of the test cycle. The span gases shall have a 
concentration between 75 and 100 percent of full-scale chart deflection. 
The flow rates and system pressures shall be approximately the same as 
those encountered during sampling. The HFID analyzer shall be zeroed and 
spanned through the overflow sampling system.
    (6) Re-check zero response. If this zero response differs from the 
zero response recorded in paragraph (d)(5) of this section by more than 
1 percent of full scale, then paragraphs (d)(4), (d)(5), and (d)(6) of 
this section must be repeated.
    (7) If a chart recorder is used, identify and record the most recent 
zero and span response as the pre-analysis values.
    (8) If ADC equipment is used, electronically record the most recent 
zero and span response as the pre-analysis values.
    (9) Collect background HC, CO, CO<INF>2, and NO<INF>X in a sample 
bag (for dilute exhaust sampling only, see Sec. 89.420-96).
    (10) Perform a post-analysis zero and span check for each range used 
at the conditions specified in paragraph (d)(5) of this section. Record 
these responses as the post-analysis values.
    (11) Neither the zero drift nor the span drift between the pre-
analysis and post-analysis checks on any range used may exceed 3 percent 
for HC, or 2 percent for NO<INF>X, CO, and CO<INF>2, of full scale chart 
deflection, or the test is void. (If the HC drift is greater than 3 
percent of full-scale chart deflection, hydrocarbon hangup is likely.)
    (12) Determine background levels of NO<INF>X, CO, or CO<INF>2 (for 
dilute exhaust sampling only) by the bag sample technique outlined in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (e) Hydrocarbon hangup. If HC hangup is indicated, the following 
sequence may be performed:
    (1) Fill a clean sample bag with background air.
    (2) Zero and span the HFID at the analyzer ports.
    (3) Analyze the background air sample bag through the analyzer 
ports.
    (4) Analyze the background air through the entire sample probe 
system.
    (5) If the difference between the readings obtained is 2 ppm or 
more, clean the sample probe and the sample line.
    (6) Reassemble the sample system, heat to specified temperature, and 
repeat the procedure in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(6) of this 
section.

Sec. 89.412-96  Raw gaseous exhaust sampling and analytical system description.

    (a) Schematic drawing. An example of a sampling and analytical 
system which may be used for testing under this subpart is shown in 
Figure 1 in appendix B to subpart D. All components or parts of 
components that are wetted by the sample or corrosive calibration gases 
shall be either chemically cleaned stainless steel or inert material, 
for example, polytetrafluoroethylene resin. The use of ``gauge savers'' 
or ``protectors'' with nonreactive diaphragms to reduce dead volumes is 
permitted.
    (b) Sample probe. (1) The sample probe shall be a straight, closed-
end, stainless steel, multi-hole probe. The inside diameter shall not be 
greater than the inside diameter of the sample line plus 0.03 cm. The 
wall thickness of the

[[Page 83]]

probe shall not be greater than 0.10 cm. The fitting that attaches the 
probe to the exhaust pipe shall be as small as practical in order to 
minimize heat loss from the probe.
    (2) The probe shall have a minimum of three holes. The spacing of 
the radial planes for each hole in the probe must be such that they 
cover approximately equal cross-sectional areas of the exhaust duct. See 
Figure 1 in appendix A to this subpart. The angular spacing of the holes 
must be approximately equal. The angular spacing of any two holes in one 
plane may not be 180 deg. <plus-minus>20 deg. (that is, section view C-C 
of Figure 1 in appendix A to this subpart). The holes should be sized 
such that each has approximately the same flow. If only three holes are 
used, they may not all be in the same radial plane.
    (3) The probe shall extend radially across the exhaust duct. The 
probe must pass through the approximate center and must extend across at 
least 80 percent of the diameter of the duct.
    (c) Sample transfer line. (1) The maximum inside diameter of the 
sample line shall not exceed 1.32 cm.
    (2) If valve V2 is used, the sample probe must connect directly to 
valve V2. The location of optional valve V2 may not be greater than 1.22 
m from the exhaust duct.
    (3) The location of optional valve V16 may not be greater than 61 cm 
from the sample pump. The leakage rate for this section on the pressure 
side of the sample pump may not exceed the leakage rate specification 
for the vacuum side of the pump.
    (d) Venting. All vents, including analyzer vents, bypass flow, and 
pressure relief vents of regulators, should be vented in such a manner 
to avoid endangering personnel in the immediate area.
    (e) Any variation from the specifications in this subpart including 
performance specifications and emission detection methods may be used 
only with prior approval by the Administrator.
    (f) Additional components, such as instruments, valves, solenoids, 
pumps, switches, and so forth, may be employed to provide additional 
information and coordinate the functions of the component systems.
    (g) The following requirements must be incorporated in each system 
used for raw testing under this subpart.
    (1) The sample for all components shall be taken with one sample 
probe, except as allowed under Sec. 89.413-96, and internally split to 
the different analyzers.
    (2) The sample transport system from the engine exhaust pipe to the 
HC analyzer and the NO<INF>X analyzer must be heated as indicated in 
Figure 1 in appendix B of subpart D.


<R05>
Sec. 89.413-96  Raw sampling procedures.

    Follow these procedures when sampling for gaseous emissions.
    (a) The gaseous emission sampling probe must be installed at least 
0.5 m or 3 times the diameter of the exhaust pipe--whichever is the 
larger--upstream of the exit of the exhaust gas system.
    (b) In the case of a multi-cylinder engine with a branched exhaust 
manifold, the inlet of the probe shall be located sufficiently far 
downstream so as to ensure that the sample is representative of the 
average exhaust emissions from all cylinders.
    (c) In multi-cylinder engines having distinct groups of manifolds, 
such as in a ``Vee'' engine configuration, it is permissible to:
    (1) Sample after all exhaust pipes have been connected together into 
a single exhaust pipe.
    (2) For each mode, sample from each exhaust pipe and average the 
gaseous concentrations to determine a value for each mode.
    (3) Sample from all exhaust pipes simultaneously with the sample 
lines connected to a common manifold prior to the analyzer. It must be 
demonstrated that the flow rate through each individual sample line is 
<plus-minus>4 percent of the average flow rate through all the sample 
lines.
    (4) Use another method, if it has been approved in advance by the 
Administrator.
    (d) All heated sampling lines shall be fitted with a heated filter 
to extract solid particles from the flow of gas required for analysis. 
The sample line for CO, CO<INF>2, and O<INF>2 analysis may be heated or 
unheated.

[[Page 84]]

    (e) If the composition of the exhaust gas is influenced by any 
treatment such as heat exchanger or air injection (except catalysts and 
soot filters) then the exhaust probe must be taken upstream of this 
device.


<R05>
Sec. 89.414-96  Air flow measurement specifications.

    (a) The air flow measurement method used must have a range large 
enough to accurately measure the air flow over the engine operating 
range during the test. Overall measurement accuracy must be 
<plus-minus>2 percent of the reading for all modes except the idle mode. 
For the idle mode, the measurement accuracy shall be <plus-minus>5 
percent or less of the reading. The Administrator must be advised of the 
method used prior to testing.
    (b) When an engine system incorporates devices that affect the air 
flow measurement (such as air bleeds) that result in understated exhaust 
emission results, corrections to the exhaust emission results shall be 
made to account for such effects.


<R05>
Sec. 89.415-96  Fuel flow measurement specifications.

    The fuel flow rate measurement instrument must have a minimum 
accuracy of <plus-minus>1 percent of full-scale flow rate for each 
measurement range used. An exception is allowed at the idle point. For 
this mode (idle), the minimum accuracy is <plus-minus>2 percent of full-
scale flow rate for the measurement range used. The controlling 
parameters are the elapsed time measurement of the event and the weight 
or volume measurement.


<R05>
Sec. 89.416-96  Raw exhaust gas flow.

    The exhaust gas flow shall be determined by one of the methods 
described in this section and conform to the tolerances of Table 3 in 
appendix A to subpart D:
    (a) Measurement of the air flow and the fuel flow by suitable 
metering systems (for details see SAE J244. This procedure has been 
incorporated by reference. See Sec. 89.6.) and calculation of the 
exhaust gas flow as follows:

G<INF>EXHW=G<INF>AIRW+G<INF>FUEL    (for wet exhaust mass)

or

V<INF>EXHD=V<INF>AIRD+(-.767) x G<INF>FUEL    (for dry exhaust volume)

or

V<INF>EXHW=V<INF>AIRW+.749 x G<INF>FUEL    (for wet exhaust volume)

    (b) Exhaust mass calculation from fuel consumption (see Sec. 89.415-
96) and exhaust gas concentrations using the method found in 
Sec. 89.418-96.


<R05>
Sec. 89.417-96  Data evaluation for gaseous emissions.

    For the evaluation of the gaseous emission recording, the last 60 
seconds of each mode are recorded, and the average values for HC, CO, 
CO<INF>2, and NO<INF>X during each mode are determined from the average 
concentration readings determined from the corresponding calibration 
data.


<R05>
Sec. 89.418-96  Raw emission sampling calculations.

    (a) The final test results shall be derived through the steps 
described in this section.
    (b) The exhaust gas flow rate G<INF>EXHW and V<INF>EXHW shall be 
determined (see Sec. 89.416-96) for each mode.
    (c) When applying G<INF>EXHW the measured concentration shall be 
converted to a wet basis according to the following formula, if not 
already measured on a wet basis.

<R05>
Sec. 89.419-96  Dilute gaseous exhaust sampling and analytical system description.

    (a) General. The exhaust gas sampling system described in this 
section is designed to measure the true mass of gaseous emissions in the 
exhaust of petroleum-fueled nonroad compression-ignition engines. This 
system utilizes the CVS concept (described in Sec. 86.1310-90 of this 
chapter) of measuring mass emissions of HC, CO, and CO<INF>2. A 
continuously integrated system is required for HC and NO<INF>X 
measurement and is allowed for all CO and CO<INF>2 measurements. The 
mass of gaseous emissions is determined from the sample concentration 
and total flow over the test period. As an option, the measurement of 
total fuel mass consumed over a cycle may be substituted for the exhaust 
measurement of CO<INF>2. General requirements are as follows:
    (1) This sampling system requires the use of a PDP-CVS and a heat 
exchanger or a CFV-CVS with either a heat exchanger or electronic flow 
compensation. Figure 2 in appendix A to this subpart is a schematic 
drawing of the PDP-CVS system. Figure 3 in appendix A to this subpart is 
a schematic drawing of the CFV-CVS system.
    (2) The HC analytical system for petroleum-fueled compression-
ignition engines requires a heated flame ionization detector (HFID) and 
heated sample system (191 <plus-minus>11  deg.C).
    (i) The HFID sample must be taken directly from the diluted exhaust 
stream through a heated probe and integrated continuously over the test 
cycle. Unless compensation for varying flow is made, the HFID must be 
used with a constant flow system to ensure a representative sample.
    (ii) The heated probe shall be located in the primary dilution 
tunnel and far enough downstream of the mixing chamber to ensure a 
uniform sample distribution across the CVS duct at the point of 
sampling.
    (3) The CO and CO<INF>2 analytical system requires:
    (i) Bag sampling (see Sec. 86.1309-90 of this chapter) and 
analytical capabilities (see Sec. 86.1311-90 of this chapter), as shown 
in Figure 2 and Figure 3 in appendix A to this subpart; or
    (ii) Continuously integrated measurement of diluted CO and CO<INF>2 
meeting

[[Page 87]]

the minimum requirements and technical specifications contained in 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Unless compensation for varying flow 
is made, a constant flow system must be used to ensure a representative 
sample.
    (4) The NO<INF>X analytical system requires a continuously 
integrated measurement of diluted NO<INF>X meeting the minimum 
requirements and technical specifications contained in paragraph (b)(4) 
of this section. Unless compensation for varying flow is made, a 
constant flow system must be used to ensure a representative sample.
    (5) Since various configurations can produce equivalent results, 
exact conformance with these drawings is not required. Additional 
components such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps, and switches 
may be used to provide additional information and coordinate the 
functions of the component systems. Other components, such as snubbers, 
which are not needed to maintain accuracy on some systems, may be 
excluded if their exclusion is based upon good engineering judgment.
    (6) Other sampling and/or analytical systems may be used if shown to 
yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the 
Administrator.
    (b) Component description. The components necessary for exhaust 
sampling shall meet the following requirements:
    (1) Exhaust dilution system. The PDP-CVS shall conform to all of the 
requirements listed for the exhaust gas PDP-CVS in Sec. 86.1309-90(b) of 
this chapter. The CFV-CVS shall conform to all of the requirements 
listed for the exhaust gas CFV-CVS in Sec. 86.1309-90(c) of this 
chapter. In addition, the CVS must conform to the following 
requirements:
    (i) The flow capacity of the CVS must be sufficient to maintain the 
diluted exhaust stream at or below the temperature required for the 
measurement of hydrocarbon emissions noted in the following paragraph 
and to prevent condensation of water at any point in the dilution 
tunnel.
    (ii) The flow capacity of the CVS must be sufficient to maintain the 
diluted exhaust stream in the primary dilution tunnel at a temperature 
of 191  deg.C or less at the sampling zone for hydrocarbon measurement 
and as required to prevent condensation at any point in the dilution 
tunnel. Gaseous emission samples may be taken directly from this 
sampling point.
    (iii) For the CFV-CVS, either a heat exchanger or electronic flow 
compensation is required (see Figure 3 in appendix A to this subpart).
    (iv) For the CFV-CVS when a heat exchanger is used, the gas mixture 
temperature, measured at a point immediately ahead of the critical flow 
venturi, shall be within <plus-minus>11  deg.C) of the average operating 
temperature observed during the test with the simultaneous requirement 
that condensation does not occur. The temperature measuring system 
(sensors and readout) shall have an accuracy and precision of 
<plus-minus>2  deg.C. For systems utilizing a flow compensator to 
maintain proportional flow, the requirement for maintaining constant 
temperature is not necessary.
    (v) The primary dilution air shall have a temperature of 25  deg.C 
<plus-minus>5  deg.C.
    (2) Continuous HC measurement system. (i) The continuous HC sample 
system (as shown in Figure 2 or 3 in appendix A to this subpart) uses an 
``overflow'' zero and span system. In this type of system, excess zero 
or span gas spills out of the probe when zero and span checks of the 
analyzer are made. The ``overflow'' system may also be used to calibrate 
the HC analyzer per Sec. 86.1321-90(b) of this chapter, although this is 
not required.
    (ii) No other analyzers may draw a sample from the continuous HC 
sample probe, line or system, unless a common sample pump is used for 
all analyzers and the sample line system design reflects good 
engineering practice.
    (iii) The overflow gas flow rates into the sample line shall be at 
least 105 percent of the sample system flow rate.
    (iv) The overflow gases shall enter the heated sample line as close 
as practical to the outside surface of the CVS duct or dilution tunnel.
    (v) The continuous HC sampling system shall consist of a probe 
(which must raise the sample to the specified temperature) and, where 
used, a sample transfer system (which must maintain the specified 
temperature). The continuous hydrocarbon sampling system (exclusive of 
the probe) shall:

[[Page 88]]

    (A) Maintain a wall temperature of 191  deg.C <plus-minus>11  deg.C 
as measured at every separately controlled heated component (that is, 
filters, heated line sections), using permanent thermocouples located at 
each of the separate components.
    (B) Have a wall temperature of 191  deg.C <plus-minus>11  deg.C over 
its entire length. The temperature of the system shall be demonstrated 
by profiling the thermal characteristics of the system where possible at 
initial installation and after any major maintenance performed on the 
system. The profiling shall be accomplished using the insertion 
thermocouple probing technique. The system temperature will be monitored 
continuously during testing at the locations and temperature described 
in Sec. 86.1310-90(b)(3)(v).
    (C) Maintain a gas temperature of 191  deg.C <plus-minus>11  deg.C 
immediately before the heated filter and HFID. These gas temperatures 
will be determined by a temperature sensor located immediately upstream 
of each component.
    (vi) The continuous hydrocarbon sampling probe shall:
    (A) Be defined as the first 25 cm to 76 cm of the continuous 
hydrocarbon sampling system.
    (B) Have a 0.48 cm minimum inside diameter.
    (C) Be installed in the primary dilution tunnel at a point where the 
dilution air and exhaust are well mixed (that is, approximately 10 
tunnel diameters downstream of the point where the exhaust enters the 
dilution tunnel).
    (D) Be sufficiently distant (radially) from other probes and the 
tunnel wall so as to be free from the influence of any wakes or eddies.
    (E) Increase the gas stream temperature to 191  deg.C <plus-minus>11 
 deg.C at the exit of the probe. The ability of the probe to accomplish 
this shall be demonstrated using the insertion thermocouple technique at 
initial installation and after any major maintenance. Compliance with 
the temperature specification shall be demonstrated by continuously 
recording during each test the temperature of either the gas stream or 
the wall of the sample probe at its terminus.
    (vii) The response time of the continuous measurement system shall 
be no greater than:
    (A) 1.5 seconds from an instantaneous step change at the port 
entrance to the analyzer to within 90 percent of the step change.
    (B) 20 seconds from an instantaneous step change at the entrance to 
the sample probe or overflow span gas port to within 90 percent of the 
step change. Analysis system response time shall be coordinated with CVS 
flow fluctuations and sampling time/test cycle offsets if necessary.
    (C) For the purpose of verification of response times, the step 
change shall be at least 60 percent of full-scale chart deflection.
    (3) Primary dilution tunnel. (i) The primary dilution tunnel shall 
be:
    (A) Small enough in diameter to cause turbulent flow (Reynolds 
Number greater than 4000) and of sufficient length to cause complete 
mixing of the exhaust and dilution air;
    (B) At least 46 cm in diameter; (engines below 110 kW may use a 
dilution tunnel that is 20 cm in diameter or larger)
    (C) Constructed of electrically conductive material which does not 
react with the exhaust components; and
    (D) Electrically grounded.
    (ii) The temperature of the diluted exhaust stream inside of the 
primary dilution tunnel shall be sufficient to prevent water 
condensation.
    (iii) The engine exhaust shall be directed downstream at the point 
where it is introduced into the primary dilution tunnel.
    (4) Continuously integrated NO<INF>X, CO, and CO<INF>2 measurement 
systems. (i) The sample probe shall:
    (A) Be in the same plane as the continuous HC probe, but shall be 
sufficiently distant (radially) from other probes and the tunnel wall so 
as to be free from the influences of any wakes or eddies.
    (B) Heated and insulated over the entire length, to prevent water 
condensation, to a minimum temperature of 55  deg.C. Sample gas 
temperature immediately before the first filter in the system shall be 
at least 55  deg.C.
    (ii) The continuous NO<INF>X, CO, or CO<INF>2 sampling and analysis 
system shall

[[Page 89]]

conform to the specifications of part 86, subpart D of this chapter with 
the following exceptions and revisions:
    (A) The system components required to be heated by part 86, subpart 
D of this chapter need only be heated to prevent water condensation, the 
minimum component temperature shall be 55  deg.C.
    (B) The system response shall be no greater than 20 seconds. 
Analysis system response time shall be coordinated with CVS flow 
fluctuations and sampling time/test cycle offsets, if necessary.
    (C) Alternative NO<INF>X measurement techniques outlined in 
Sec. 86.346-79 of this chapter are not permitted for NO<INF>X 
measurement in this subpart.
    (D) All analytical gases must conform to the specifications of 
Sec. 89.312-96.
    (E) Any range on a linear analyzer below 155 ppm must have and use a 
calibration curve conforming to Sec. 89.310-96.
    (iii) The chart deflections or voltage output of analyzers with non-
linear calibration curves shall be converted to concentration values by 
the calibration curve(s) specified in Sec. 89.323-96 before flow 
correction (if used) and subsequent integration takes place.

Sec. 89.420-96  Background sample.

    (a) Background samples are produced by drawing a sample of the 
dilution air during the 60 second exhaust collection phase of each test 
cycle mode.
    (1) Individual background samples may be produced and analyzed for 
each mode. Hence, a unique background value will be used for the 
emission calculations for each mode.
    (2) Alternatively, a single background sample may be produced by 
drawing a sample during the collection phase of each of the test cycle 
modes. Hence, a single cumulative background value will be used for the 
emission calculations for each mode.
    (b) For analysis of the individual sample described in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, a single value representing the average chart 
deflection over a 10-second stabilized period is stored. All readings 
taken during the 10-second interval must be stable at the final value to 
within <plus-minus>1 percent of full scale.
    (c) Measure HC, CO, CO<INF>2, and NO<INF>X exhaust and background 
concentrations in the sample bag(s) with approximately the same flow 
rates and pressures used during calibration.

Sec. 89.421-96  Exhaust gas analytical system; CVS bag sample.

    (a) Schematic drawings. Figure 4 in appendix A to this subpart is a 
schematic drawing of the exhaust gas analytical system used for 
analyzing CVS bag samples from compression- ignition engines. Since 
various configurations can produce accurate results, exact conformance 
with the drawing is not required. Additional components such as 
instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps and switches may be used to 
provide additional information and coordinate the functions of the 
component systems. Other components such as snubbers, which are not 
needed to maintain accuracy in some systems, may be excluded if their 
exclusion is based upon good engineering judgment.
    (b) Major component description. The analytical system, Figure 4 in 
appendix A to this subpart, consists of a flame ionization detector 
(FID) (heated for petroleum-fueled compression-ignition engines to 191 
deg.C <plus-minus>6  deg.C) for the measurement of hydrocarbons, 
nondispersive infrared analyzers (NDIR) for the measurement of carbon 
monoxide and carbon dioxide, and a chemiluminescence detector (CLD) (or 
HCLD) for the measurement of oxides of nitrogen. The exhaust gas 
analytical system shall conform to the following requirements:
    (1) The CLD (or HCLD) requires that the nitrogen dioxide present in 
the sample be converted to nitric oxide before analysis. Other types of 
analyzers may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if 
approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (2) If CO instruments are used which are essentially free of 
CO<INF>2 and water vapor interference, the use of the conditioning 
column may be deleted. (See Secs. 86.1322-84 and 86.1342-90 of this 
chapter.)
    (3) A CO instrument will be considered to be essentially free of 
CO<INF>2 and water vapor interference if its response to a mixture of 3 
percent CO<INF>2 in N2, which has been bubbled through water at room 
temperature, produces an

[[Page 90]]

equivalent CO response, as measured on the most sensitive CO range, 
which is less than 1 percent of full scale CO concentration on ranges 
above 300 ppm full scale or less than 3 ppm on ranges below 300 ppm full 
scale. (See Sec. 86.1322-84 of this chapter.)
    (c) Alternate analytical systems. Analysis systems meeting the 
specifications of part 86, subpart D of this chapter (with the exception 
of Secs. 86.346-79 and 86.347-79) may be used for the testing required 
under this subpart. Heated analyzers may be used in their heated 
configuration.
    (d) Other analyzers and equipment. Other types of analyzers and 
equipment may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if 
approved in advance by the Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 89.422-96  Dilute sampling procedures--CVS calibration.

    (a) The CVS is calibrated using an accurate flowmeter and restrictor 
valve.
    (1) The flowmeter calibration must be traceable to NIST 
measurements, and will serve as the reference value (NIST ``true'' 
value) for the CVS calibration. (Note: In no case should an upstream 
screen or other restriction which can affect the flow be used ahead of 
the flowmeter unless calibrated throughout the flow range with such a 
device.)
    (2) The CVS calibration procedures are designed for use of a 
``metering venturi'' type flowmeter. Large radius or ASME flow nozzles 
are considered equivalent if traceable to NIST measurements. Other 
measurement systems may be used if shown to be equivalent under the test 
conditions in this section and traceable to NIST measurements.
    (3) Measurements of the various flowmeter parameters are recorded 
and related to flow through the CVS.
    (4) Procedures used by EPA for both PDP-CVS and CFV-CVS are outlined 
below. Other procedures yielding equivalent results may be used if 
approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (b) After the calibration curve has been obtained, verification of 
the entire system may be performed by injecting a known mass of gas into 
the system and comparing the mass indicated by the system to the true 
mass injected. An indicated error does not necessarily mean that the 
calibration is wrong, since other factors can influence the accuracy of 
the system (for example, analyzer calibration, leaks, or HC hangup). A 
verification procedure is found in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (c) PDP-CVS calibration. (1) The following calibration procedure 
outlines the equipment, the test configuration, and the various 
parameters which must be measured to establish the flow rate of the PDP-
CVS pump.
    (i) All the parameters related to the pump are simultaneously 
measured with the parameters related to a flowmeter which is connected 
in series with the pump.
    (ii) The calculated flow rate, in
(cm\3\/s), (at pump inlet absolute pressure and temperature) can then be 
plotted versus a correlation function which is the value of a specific 
combination of pump parameters.
    (iii) The linear equation which relates the pump flow and the 
correlation function is then determined.
    (iv) In the event that a CVS has a multiple speed drive, a 
calibration for each range used must be performed.
    (2) This calibration procedure is based on the measurement of the 
absolute values of the pump and flowmeter parameters that relate the 
flow rate at each point. Two conditions must be maintained to assure the 
accuracy and integrity of the calibration curve:
    (i) The temperature stability must be maintained during calibration. 
(Flowmeters are sensitive to inlet temperature oscillations; this can 
cause the data points to be scattered. Gradual changes in temperature 
are acceptable as long as they occur over a period of several minutes.)
    (ii) All connections and ducting between the flowmeter and the CVS 
pump must be absolutely void of leakage.
    (3) During an exhaust emission test the measurement of these same 
pump parameters enables the user to calculate the flow rate from the 
calibration equation.
    (4) Connect a system as shown in Figure 5 in appendix A to this 
subpart. Although particular types of equipment are shown, other 
configurations that

[[Page 91]]

yield equivalent results may be used if approved in advance by the 
Administrator. For the system indicated, the following measurements and 
accuracies are required:

    (5) After the system has been connected as shown in Figure 5 in 
appendix A to this subpart, set the variable restrictor in the wide open 
position and run the CVS pump for 20 minutes. Record the calibration 
data.
    (6) Reset the restrictor valve to a more restricted condition in an 
increment of pump inlet depression that will yield a minimum of six data 
points for the total calibration. Allow the system to stabilize for 3 
minutes and repeat the data acquisition.
    (7) Data analysis:
    (i) The air flow rate, Q<INF>s, at each test point is calculated in 
standard cubic meters per minute (0  deg.C, 101.3 kPa) from the 
flowmeter data using the manufacturer's prescribed method.
    (ii) The air flow rate is then converted to pump flow, V<INF>o, in 
cubic meter per revolution at absolute pump inlet temperature and 
pressure:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JN94.020

Where:

V<INF>o=Pump flow, (m<SUP>3/rev) at T<INF>p, P<INF>p.
Q<INF>s=Meter air flow rate in standard cubic meters per minute, 
standard conditions are 0  deg.C, 101.3 kPa.
n=Pump speed in revolutions per minute.
T<INF>p=Pump inlet temperature  deg.K=P<INF>ti+273  deg.K, P<INF>ti=Pump 
inlet temp  deg.C
P<INF>p=Absolute pump inlet pressure, (kPa)
    =P<INF>B-P<INF>PI
Where:

P<INF>B=barometric pressure, (kPa).
P<INF>PI=Pump inlet depression, (kPa).

    (iii) The correlation function at each test point is then calculated 
from the calibration data:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JN94.021

X<INF>o=correlation function.
<greek-D>p=The pressure differential from pump inlet to pump outlet, 
(kPa).
    =P<INF>e-P<INF>p.
P<INF>e=Absolute pump outlet pressure, (kPa)
    =P<INF>B+P<INF>PO
Where:

P<INF>PO=Pressure head at pump outlet, (kPa).

    (iv) A linear least squares fit is performed to generate the 
calibration equation which has the form:

V<INF>o=D<INF>o-M(X<INF>o)
D<INF>o and M are the intercept and slope constants, respectively, 
describing the regression line.

    (8) A CVS system that has multiple speeds must be calibrated on each 
speed used. The calibration curves generated for the ranges will be 
approximately parallel and the intercept values, D<INF>o, will increase 
as the pump flow range decreases.
    (9) If the calibration has been performed carefully, the calculated 
values from the equation will be within <plus-minus>0.50 percent of the 
measured value of V<INF>o. Values of M will vary from one pump

[[Page 92]]

to another, but values of D<INF>o for pumps of the same make, model, and 
range should agree within <plus-minus>3 percent of each other. 
Calibrations should be performed at pump start-up and after major 
maintenance to assure the stability of the pump slip rate. Analysis of 
mass injection data will also reflect pump slip stability.
    (d) CFV-CVS calibration. (1) Calibration of the CFV is based upon 
the flow equation for a critical venturi. Gas flow is a function of 
inlet pressure and temperature:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JN94.022

Where:

Qs=flow.
Kv=calibration coefficient.
P=absolute pressure.
T=absolute temperature.

The calibration procedure described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section 
establishes the value of the calibration coefficient at measured values 
of pressure, temperature, and air flow.
    (2) The manufacturer's recommended procedure shall be followed for 
calibrating electronic portions of the CFV.
    (3) Measurements necessary for flow calibration are as follows:

                                          Calibration Data Measurements

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (4) Set up equipment as shown in Figure 6 in appendix A to subpart 
and eliminate leaks. (Leaks between the flow measuring devices and the 
critical flow venturi will seriously affect the accuracy of the 
calibration.)
    (5) Set the variable flow restrictor to the open position, start the 
blower, and allow the system to stabilize. Record data from all 
instruments.
    (6) Vary the flow restrictor and make at least eight readings across 
the critical flow range of the venturi.
    (7) Data analysis. The data recorded during the calibration are to 
be used in the following calculations:
    (i) The air flow rate (designated as Q<INF>s) at each test point is 
calculated in standard cubic feet per minute from the flow meter data 
using the manufacturer's prescribed method.
    (ii) Calculate values of the calibration coefficient for each test 
point:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JN94.023

Where:

Q<INF>s = Flow rate in standard cubic meter per minute, at the standard 
conditions of 0  deg.C, 101.3 kPa.
T<INF>v = Temperature at venturi inlet,  deg.K.
P<INF>v = PB - PPI (= Pressure at venturi inlet, kPA)
Where:

P<INF>PI = Venturi inlet pressure depression, (kPa).

    (iii) Plot K<INF>v as a function of venturi inlet pressure. For 
choked flow, K<INF>v will have a relatively constant value. As pressure 
decreases (vacuum increases), the venturi becomes unchoked and K<INF>v 
decreases. (See Figure 7 in appendix A to this subpart.)
    (iv) For a minimum of eight points in the critical region calculate 
an average K<INF>v and the standard deviation.
    (v) If the standard deviation exceeds 0.3 percent of the average 
K<INF>v, take corrective action.
    (e) CVS system verification. The following ``gravimetric'' technique 
can be used to verify that the CVS and analytical instruments can 
accurately measure a mass of gas that has been injected into the system. 
(Verification can also be accomplished by constant

[[Page 93]]

flow metering using critical flow orifice devices.)
    (1) Obtain a small cylinder that has been charged with 99.5 percent 
or greater propane or carbon monoxide gas (Caution--carbon monoxide is 
poisonous).
    (2) Determine a reference cylinder weight to the nearest 0.01 grams.
    (3) Operate the CVS in the normal manner and release a quantity of 
pure propane into the system during the sampling period (approximately 5 
minutes).
    (4) The calculations are performed in the normal way except in the 
case of propane. The density of propane (0.6109 kg/m\3\/carbon atom)) is 
used in place of the density of exhaust hydrocarbons.
    (5) The gravimetric mass is subtracted from the CVS measured mass 
and then divided by the gravimetric mass to determine the percent 
accuracy of the system.
    (6) Good engineering practice requires that the cause for any 
discrepancy greater than <plus-minus>2 percent must be found and 
corrected.

    The CVS positive displacement pump or critical flow venturi shall be 
calibrated following initial installation, major maintenance or as 
necessary when indicated by the CVS system verification (described in 
Sec. 89.352-96(e)).

in grams per kilowatt-hour.

    (b) The mass of each pollutant for each mode for bag measurements 
and diesel heat exchanger system measurements is determined from the 
following equations:

    (2) Oxides of nitrogen mass:

NO<INF>Xmass = V<INF>mix  x  Density<INF>NO2  x  KH  x  (NO<INF>Xconc/
10<SUP>6)

    (3) Carbon monoxide mass:

CO<INF>mass = V<INF>mix  x  Density<INF>CO  x  (CO<INF>conc/10<SUP>6)

    (4) Carbon dioxide mass:

CO<INF>2mass = V<INF>mix  x  Density<INF>CO2  x  (CO<INF>2conc/10<INF>2)

    (c) The mass of each pollutant for the mode for flow compensated 
sample systems is determined from the following equations:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JN94.025

carbon to hydrogen ratio of 1:1.93 for #1 diesel, and 1:1.80 for #2 
diesel at 20  deg.C and 101.3 kPa pressure.
HC<INF>conc = Hydrocarbon concentration of the dilute exhaust sample 
corrected for background, in ppm carbon equivalent (that is, equivalent 
propane times 3).

the fuel is 1:1.85. As an option the measured actual carbon to hydrogen 
ratio may be used:

as measured, ppm.

    Note: If a CO instrument which meets the criteria specified in 
Sec. 86.1311-90 of this chapter is used and the conditioning column has 
been deleted, CO<INF>em must be substituted directly for CO<INF>e and 
CO<INF>dm must be substituted directly for CO<INF>d.
    (4) For carbon dioxide equation:

CO<INF>2mass=Carbon dioxide emissions, in grams per test mode.
Density CO<INF>2=Density of carbon dioxide is 1.830 kg/m<SUP>3, at 20

(kW-hr)
M=mass of fuel in grams, used by the engine during a mode

                Subpart F--Selective Enforcement Auditing


<R05>
Sec. 89.501-96  Applicability.

    The requirements of subpart F are applicable to all nonroad engines 
subject to the provisions of subpart A of part 89.


<R05>
Sec. 89.502-96  Definitions.

    The definitions in subpart A of this part apply to this subpart. The 
following definitions also apply to this subpart.
    Acceptable quality level (AQL) means the maximum percentage of 
failing engines that can be considered a satisfactory process average 
for sampling inspections.
    Configuration means any subclassification of an engine family which 
can be described on the basis of gross power, emission control system, 
governed speed, injector size, engine calibration, and other parameters 
as designated by the Administrator.
    Inspection criteria means the pass and fail numbers associated with 
a particular sampling plan.
    Test engine means an engine in a test sample.
    Test sample means the collection of engines selected from the 
population of an engine family for emission testing.


<R05>
Sec. 89.503-96  Test orders.

    (a) A test order addressed to the manufacturer is required for any 
testing under this subpart.
    (b) The test order is signed by the Assistant Administrator for Air 
and Radiation or his or her designee. The test order must be delivered 
in person by an EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative 
to a company representative or sent by registered mail, return receipt 
requested, to the manufacturer's representative who signed the 
application for certification submitted by the manufacturer, pursuant to 
the requirements of the applicable section of subpart B of this part. 
Upon receipt of a test order, the manufacturer must comply with all of 
the provisions of this subpart and instructions in the test order.
    (c) Information included in test order. (1) The test order will 
specify the engine family to be selected for testing, the manufacturer's 
engine assembly plant or associated storage facility or port facility 
(for imported engines) from which the engines must be selected, the time 
and location at which engines must be selected, and the procedure by 
which engines of the specified family must be selected. The test order 
may specify the configuration to be audited and/or the number of engines 
to be selected per day. Engine manufacturers are required to select a 
minimum of four engines per day unless an alternate selection procedure 
is approved pursuant to Sec. 89.507-96(a), or unless total production of 
the specified configuration is less than four engines per day. If total 
production of the specified configuration is less than four engines per 
day, the manufacturer selects the actual number of engines produced per 
day.
    (2) The test order may include alternate families to be selected for 
testing at the Administrator's discretion in the event that engines of 
the specified family are not available for testing because those engines 
are not being manufactured during the specified time or are not being 
stored at the specified assembly plant, associated storage facilities, 
or port of entry.
    (3) If the specified family is not being manufactured at a rate of 
at least two engines per day in the case of manufacturers specified in 
Sec. 89.508-96(g)(1), or one engine per day in the case of manufacturers 
specified in Sec. 89.508-96(g)(2), over the expected duration of the 
audit, the Assistant Administrator or her or his designated 
representative may select engines of the alternate family for testing.
    (4) In addition, the test order may include other directions or 
information essential to the administration of the required testing.
    (d) A manufacturer may submit a list of engine families and the 
corresponding assembly plants, associated storage facilities, or (in the 
case of imported engines) port facilities from which the manufacturer 
prefers to have engines selected for testing in response to a test 
order. In order that a manufacturer's preferred location be considered 
for inclusion in a test order for a particular engine family, the list 
must be submitted prior to issuance of the test

[[Page 105]]

order. Notwithstanding the fact that a manufacturer has submitted the 
list, the Administrator may order selection at other than a preferred 
location.
    (e) Upon receipt of a test order, a manufacturer must proceed in 
accordance with the provisions of this subpart.
    (f)(1) During a given model year, the Administrator may not issue to 
a manufacturer more Selective Enforcement Auditing (SEA) test orders 
than an annual limit determined to be the larger of the following 
factors:
    (i) Production factor, determined by dividing the projected nonroad 
engine sales in the United States for that model year, as declared by 
the manufacturer under Sec. 89.505- 96(c)(1), by 16,000 and rounding to 
the nearest whole number. If the projected sales are less than 8,000, 
this factor is one.
    (ii) Family factor, determined by dividing the manufacturer's total 
number of certified engine families by five and rounding to the nearest 
whole number.
    (2) If a manufacturer submits to EPA in writing prior to or during 
the model year a reliable sales projection update or adds engine 
families or deletes engine families from its production, that 
information is used for recalculating the manufacturer's annual limit of 
SEA test orders.
    (3) Any SEA test order for which the family fails under Sec. 89.510-
96 or for which testing is not completed is not counted against the 
annual limit.
    (4) When the annual limit has been met, the Administrator may issue 
additional test orders to test those families for which evidence exists 
indicating noncompliance. An SEA test order issued on this basis will 
include a statement as to the reason for its issuance.


<R05>
Sec. 89.504-96  Testing by the Administrator.

    (a) The Administrator may require by test order under Sec. 89.503-96 
that engines of a specified family be selected in a manner consistent 
with the requirements of Sec. 89.507-96 and submitted to the 
Administrator at the place designated for the purpose of conducting 
emission tests. These tests will be conducted in accordance with 
Sec. 89.508-96 to determine whether engines manufactured by the 
manufacturer conform with the regulations with respect to which the 
certificate of conformity was issued.
    (b) Designating official data. (1) Whenever the Administrator 
conducts a test on a test engine or the Administrator and manufacturer 
each conduct a test on the same test engine, the results of the 
Administrator's test comprise the official data for that engine.
    (2) Whenever the manufacturer conducts all tests on a test engine, 
the manufacturer's test data is accepted as the official data, provided 
that if the Administrator makes a determination based on testing 
conducted under paragraph (a) of this section that there is a 
substantial lack of agreement between the manufacturer's test results 
and the Administrator's test results, no manufacturer's test data from 
the manufacturer's test facility will be accepted for purposes of this 
subpart.
    (c) If testing conducted under Sec. 89.503-96 is unacceptable under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Administrator must:
    (1) Notify the manufacturer in writing of the Administrator's 
determination that the test facility is inappropriate for conducting the 
tests required by this subpart and the reasons therefor; and
    (2) Reinstate any manufacturer's data upon a showing by the 
manufacturer that the data acquired under Sec. 89.503-96 was erroneous 
and the manufacturer's data was correct.
    (d) The manufacturer may request in writing that the Administrator 
reconsider the determination in paragraph (b)(2) of this section based 
on data or information which indicates that changes have been made to 
the test facility and these changes have resolved the reasons for 
disqualification.


<R05>

    (4) To inspect and photograph any part or aspect of any engine and 
any component used in the assembly thereof that is reasonably related to 
the purpose of the entry.
    (c) EPA enforcement officers or EPA authorized representatives are 
authorized to obtain reasonable assistance without cost from those in 
charge of a facility to help the officers perform any function listed in 
this subpart and they are authorized to request the recipient of a test 
order to make arrangements with those in charge of a facility operated 
for the manufacturer's benefit to furnish reasonable assistance without 
cost to EPA whether or not the recipient controls the facility.
    (1) Reasonable assistance includes, but is not limited to, clerical, 
copying, interpretation and translation services; the making available 
on an EPA enforcement officer's or EPA authorized representative's 
request of personnel of the facility being inspected during their 
working hours to inform the EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized 
representative of how the facility operates and to answer the officer's 
or representative's questions; and the performance on request of 
emission tests on any engine which is being, has been, or will be used 
for SEA testing.
    (2) A manufacturer may be compelled to cause the personal appearance 
of any employee at such a facility before an EPA enforcement officer or 
EPA authorized representative by written request for his appearance, 
signed by the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, served on 
the manufacturer. Any such employee who has been instructed by the 
manufacturer to appear will be entitled to be accompanied, represented, 
and advised by counsel.
    (d) EPA enforcement officers or EPA authorized representatives are 
authorized to seek a warrant or court order authorizing the EPA 
enforcement officers or EPA authorized representatives to conduct 
activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section, as 
appropriate, to execute the functions specified in this section. EPA 
enforcement officers or authorized representatives may proceed ex parte 
to obtain a warrant whether or not the EPA enforcement officers or EPA 
authorized representatives first attempted to seek permission of the

person to refuse to permit an EPA enforcement

[[Page 108]]

officer(s) or EPA authorized representative(s) to conduct activities 
related to entry and access as authorized in this section if the 
officer(s) or representative(s) appears without a warrant or court 
order.
    (g) A manufacturer is responsible for locating its foreign testing 
and manufacturing facilities in jurisdictions where local law prohibits 
an EPA enforcement officer(s) or EPA authorized representative(s) from 
conducting the entry and access activities specified in this section. 
EPA will not attempt to make any inspections which it has been informed 
that local foreign law prohibits.


<R05>
Sec. 89.507-96  Sample selection.

    (a) Engines comprising a test sample will be selected at the 
location and in the manner specified in the test order. If a 
manufacturer determines that the test engines cannot be selected in the 
manner specified in the test order, an alternative selection procedure 
may be employed, provided the manufacturer requests approval of the 
alternative procedure prior to the start of test sample selection, and 
the Administrator approves the procedure.
    (b) The manufacturer must assemble the test engines of the family 
selected for testing using its normal mass production process for 
engines to be distributed into commerce. If, between the time the 
manufacturer is notified of a test order and the time the manufacturer 
finishes selecting test engines, the manufacturer implements any 
change(s) in its production processes, including quality control, which 
may reasonably be expected to affect the emissions of the engines 
selected, then the manufacturer must, during the audit, inform the 
Administrator of such changes. If the test engines are selected at a 
location where they do not have their operational and emission control 
systems installed, the test order will specify the manner and location 
for selection of components to complete assembly of the engines. The 
manufacturer must assemble these components onto the test engines using 
normal assembly and quality control procedures as documented by the 
manufacturer.
    (c) No quality control, testing, or assembly procedures will be used 
on the test engine or any portion thereof, including parts and 
subassemblies, that have not been or will not be used during the 
production and assembly of all other engines of that family, unless the 
Administrator approves the modification in assembly procedures pursuant 
to paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) The test order may specify that an EPA enforcement officer(s) or 
authorized representative(s), rather than the manufacturer, select the 
test engines according to the method specified in the test order.
    (e) The order in which test engines are selected determines the 
order in which test results are to be used in applying the sampling plan 
in accordance with Sec. 89.510-96.
    (f) The manufacturer must keep on hand all untested engines, if any, 
comprising the test sample until a pass or fail decision is reached in 
accordance with Sec. 89.510-96(e). The manufacturer may ship any tested 
engine which has not failed the requirements as set forth in 
Sec. 89.510-96(b). However, once the manufacturer ships any test engine, 
it relinquishes the prerogative to conduct retests as provided in 
Sec. 89.508-96(i).


<R05>
Sec. 89.508-96  Test procedures.

    (a)(1) For nonroad engines subject to the provisions of this 
subpart, the prescribed test procedures are the nonroad engine 8-mode 
test procedure as described in subpart E of this part, the federal smoke 
test as described in part 86, subpart I of this chapter, and the 
particulate test procedure as adopted in the California Regulations for 
New 1996 and Later Heavy-Duty Off-Road Diesel Cycle Engines. This 
procedure is incorporated by reference. See Sec. 89.6.
    (2) The Administrator may, on the basis of a written application by 
a manufacturer, prescribe test procedures other than those specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section for any nonroad engine he or she 
determines is not susceptible to satisfactory testing using the 
procedures specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (b)(1) The manufacturer may not adjust, repair, prepare, or modify 
the engines selected for testing and may not perform any emission tests 
on engines

[[Page 109]]

selected for testing pursuant to the test order unless this adjustment, 
repair, preparation, modification, and/or tests are documented in the 
manufacturer's engine assembly and inspection procedures and are 
actually performed or unless these adjustments and/or tests are required 
or permitted under this subpart or are approved in advance by the 
Administrator.
    (2) The Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any engine 
parameter which the Administrator has determined to be subject to 
adjustment for certification and Selective Enforcement Audit testing in 
accordance with Sec. 89.108-96, to any setting within the physically 
adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the Administrator 
in accordance with Sec. 89.108-96, prior to the performance of any 
tests. However, if the idle speed parameter is one which the 
Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, the 
Administrator may not adjust it to any setting which causes a lower 
engine idle speed than would have been possible within the physically 
adjustable range of the idle speed parameter if the manufacturer had 
accumulated 125 hours of service on the engine under paragraph (c) of 
this section, all other parameters being identically adjusted for the 
purpose of the comparison. The manufacturer may be requested to supply 
information needed to establish an alternate minimum idle speed. The 
Administrator, in making or specifying these adjustments, may consider 
the effect of the deviation from the manufacturer's recommended setting 
on emission performance characteristics as well as the likelihood that 
similar settings will occur on in-use engines. In determining 
likelihood, the Administrator may consider factors such as, but not 
limited to, the effect of the adjustment on engine performance 
characteristics and surveillance information from similar in-use 
engines.
    (c) Service Accumulation. Prior to performing exhaust emission 
testing on an SEA test engine, the manufacturer may accumulate on each 
engine a number of hours of service equal to the greater of 125 hours or 
the number of hours the manufacturer accumulated during certification on 
the emission data engine corresponding to the family specified in the 
test order.
    (1) Service accumulation must be performed in a manner using good 
engineering judgment to obtain emission results representative of normal 
production engines. This service accumulation must be consistent with 
the new engine break-in instructions contained in the applicable owner's 
manual.
    (2) The manufacturer must accumulate service at a minimum rate of 16 
hours per engine during each 24-hour period, unless otherwise approved 
by the Administrator.
    (i) The first 24-hour period for service begins as soon as 
authorized checks, inspections, and preparations are completed on each 
engine.
    (ii) The minimum service or mileage accumulation rate does not apply 
on weekends or holidays.
    (iii) If the manufacturer's service or target is less than the 
minimum rate specified (16 hours per day), then the minimum daily 
accumulation rate is equal to the manufacturer's service target.
    (3) Service accumulation must be completed on a sufficient number of 
test engines during consecutive 24-hour periods to assure that the 
number of engines tested per day fulfills the requirements of paragraphs 
(g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section.
    (d) The manufacturer may not perform any maintenance on test engines 
after selection for testing, nor may the Administrator allow deletion of 
any engine from the test sequence, unless requested by the manufacturer 
and approved by the Administrator before any engine maintenance or 
deletion.
    (e) The manufacturer must expeditiously ship test engines from the 
point of selection to the test facility. If the test facility is not 
located at or in close proximity to the point of selection, the 
manufacturer must assure that test engines arrive at the test facility 
within 24 hours of selection. The Administrator may approve more time 
for shipment based upon a request by the manufacturer accompanied by a 
satisfactory justification.
    (f) If an engine cannot complete the service accumulation or an 
emission

[[Page 110]]

test because of a malfunction, the manufacturer may request that the 
Administrator authorize either the repair of that engine or its deletion 
from the test sequence.
    (g) Whenever a manufacturer conducts testing pursuant to a test 
order issued under this subpart, the manufacturer must notify the 
Administrator within one working day of receipt of the test order as to 
which test facility will be used to comply with the test order. If no 
test cells are available at a desired facility, the manufacturer must 
provide alternate testing capability satisfactory to the Administrator.
    (1) A manufacturer with projected nonroad engine sales for the 
United States market for the applicable year of 7,500 or greater must 
complete emission testing at a minimum rate of two engines per 24-hour 
period, including each voided test and each smoke test.
    (2) A manufacturer with projected nonroad engine sales for the 
United States market for the applicable year of less than 7,500 must 
complete emission testing at a minimum rate of one engine per 24-hour 
period, including each voided test and each smoke test.
    (3) The Administrator may approve a lower daily rate of emission 
testing based upon a request by a manufacturer accompanied by a 
satisfactory justification.
    (h) The manufacturer must perform test engine selection, shipping, 
preparation, service accumulation, and testing in such a manner as to 
assure that the audit is performed in an expeditious manner.
    (i) Retesting. (1) The manufacturer may retest any engines tested 
during a Selective Enforcement Audit once a fail decision for the audit 
has been reached in accordance with Sec. 89.510-96(e).
    (2) The Administrator may approve retesting at other times based 
upon a request by the manufacturer accompanied by a satisfactory 
justification.
    (3) The manufacturer may retest each engine a total of three times. 
The manufacturer must test each engine or vehicle the same number of 
times. The manufacturer may accumulate additional service before 
conducting a retest, subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (j) A manufacturer must test engines with the test procedure 
specified in subpart E of this part to demonstrate compliance with the 
exhaust emission standard (or applicable FEL) for oxides of nitrogen. If 
alternate procedures were used in certification pursuant to Sec. 89.114-
96, then those alternate procedures must be used.


<R05>
Sec. 89.509-96  Calculation and reporting of test results.

    (a) Initial test results are calculated following the applicable 
test procedure specified in paragraph (a) of Sec. 89.508-96. The 
manufacturer rounds these results, in accordance with ASTM E29-90, to 
the number of decimal places contained in the applicable emission 
standard expressed to one additional significant figure. This procedure 
has been incorporated by reference. See Sec. 89.6.
    (b) Final test results are calculated by summing the initial test 
results derived in paragraph (a) of this section for each test engine, 
dividing by the number of tests conducted on the engine, and rounding in 
accordance with ASTM E29-90 to the same number of decimal places 
contained in the applicable standard expressed to one additional 
significant figure.
    (c) Within five working days after completion of testing of all 
engines pursuant to a test order, the manufacturer must submit to the 
Administrator a report which includes the following information:
    (1) The location and description of the manufacturer's exhaust 
emission test facilities which were utilized to conduct testing reported 
pursuant to this section;
    (2) The applicable standards and/or FEL against which the engines 
were tested;
    (3) A description of the engine and its associated emission-related 
component selection method used;
    (4) For each test conducted;
    (i) Test engine description, including:
    (A) Configuration and engine family identification;
    (B) Year, make, and build date;
    (C) Engine identification number; and
    (D) Number of hours of service accumulated on engine prior to 
testing;

[[Page 111]]

    (ii) Location where service accumulation was conducted and 
description of accumulation procedure and schedule;
    (iii) Test number, date, test procedure used, initial test results 
before and after rounding, and final test results for all exhaust 
emission tests, whether valid or invalid, and the reason for 
invalidation, if applicable;
    (iv) A complete description of any modification, repair, 
preparation, maintenance, and/or testing which was performed on the test 
engine and has not been reported pursuant to any other paragraph of this 
subpart and will not be performed on all other production engines;
    (v) Where an engine was deleted from the test sequence by 
authorization of the Administrator, the reason for the deletion;
    (vi) Any other information the Administrator may request relevant to 
the determination as to whether the new engines being manufactured by 
the manufacturer do in fact conform with the regulations with respect to 
which the certificate of conformity was issued; and
    (5) The following statement and endorsement:

    This report is submitted pursuant to sections 213 and 208 of the 
Clean Air Act. This Selective Enforcement Audit was conducted in 
complete conformance with all applicable regulations under 40 CFR part 
89 et seq. and the conditions of the test order. No emission-related 
changes to production processes or quality control procedures for the 
engine family tested have been made between receipt of the test order 
and conclusion of the audit. All data and information reported herein 
is, to the best of (Company Name) knowledge, true and accurate. I am 
aware of the penalties associated with violations of the Clean Air Act 
and the regulations thereunder. (Authorized Company Representative.)


<R05>
Sec. 89.510-96  Compliance with acceptable quality level and passing and failing criteria for selective enforcement audits.

    (a) The prescribed acceptable quality level is 40 percent.
    (b) A failed engine is one whose final test results pursuant to 
Sec. 89.509-96(b), for one or more of the applicable pollutants, exceed 
the applicable emission standard or family emission level.
    (c) The manufacturer must test engines comprising the test sample 
until a pass decision is reached for all pollutants or a fail decision 
is reached for one pollutant. A pass decision is reached when the 
cumulative number of failed engines, as defined in paragraph (b) of this 
section, for each pollutant is less than or equal to the pass decision 
number, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, appropriate to the 
cumulative number of engines tested. A fail decision is reached when the 
cumulative number of failed engines for one or more pollutants is 
greater than or equal to the fail decision number, as defined in 
paragraph (d) of this section, appropriate to the cumulative number of 
engines tested.
    (d) The pass and fail decision numbers associated with the 
cumulative number of engines tested are determined by using the tables 
in appendix A to this subpart, ``Sampling Plans for Selective 
Enforcement Auditing of Nonroad Engines,'' appropriate to the projected 
sales as made by the manufacturer in its report to EPA under 
Sec. 89.505-96(c)(1). In the tables in appendix A to this subpart, 
sampling plan ``stage'' refers to the cumulative number of engines 
tested. Once a pass or fail decision has been made for a particular 
pollutant, the number of engines with final test results exceeding the 
emission standard for that pollutant shall not be considered any further 
for the purposes of the audit.
    (e) Passing or failing of an SEA occurs when the decision is made on 
the last engine required to make a decision under paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (f) The Administrator may terminate testing earlier than required in 
paragraph (c) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 89.511-96  Suspension and revocation of certificates of conformity.

    (a) The certificate of conformity is suspended with respect to any 
engine failing pursuant to paragraph (b) of Sec. 89.510-96 effective 
from the time that testing of that engine is completed.
    (b) The Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity for 
a family which does not pass an SEA, pursuant to paragraph Sec. 89.510-
96(c), based on the first test or all tests conducted on each engine. 
This suspension will not

[[Page 112]]

occur before ten days after failure of the audit, unless the 
manufacturer requests an earlier suspension.
    (c) If the results of testing pursuant to these regulations indicate 
that engines of a particular family produced at one plant of a 
manufacturer do not conform to the regulations with respect to which the 
certificate of conformity was issued, the Administrator may suspend the 
certificate of conformity with respect to that family for engines 
manufactured by the manufacturer at all other plants.
    (d) Notwithstanding the fact that engines described in the 
application may be covered by a certificate of conformity, the 
Administrator may suspend such certificate immediately in whole or in 
part if the Administrator finds any one of the following infractions to 
be substantial:
    (1) The manufacturer refuses to comply with the provisions of a test 
order issued by the Administrator under Sec. 89.503-96.
    (2) The manufacturer refuses to comply with any of the requirements 
of this subpart.
    (3) The manufacturer submits false or incomplete information in any 
report or information provided to the Administrator under this subpart.
    (4) The manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data submitted 
under this subpart.
    (5) An EPA enforcement officer(s) or EPA authorized 
representative(s) is denied the opportunity to conduct activities 
related to entry and access as authorized in this subpart and a warrant 
or court order is presented to the manufacturer or the party in charge 
of a facility in question.
    (6) An EPA enforcement officer(s) or EPA authorized 
representative(s) is unable to conduct activities related to entry and 
access as authorized in Sec. 89.506-96 because a manufacturer has 
located a facility in a foreign jurisdiction where local law prohibits 
those activities.
    (e) The Administrator must notify the manufacturer in writing of any 
suspension or revocation of a certificate of conformity in whole or in 
part; a suspension or revocation is effective upon receipt of the 
notification or ten days, except that the certificate is immediately 
suspended with respect to any failed engines as provided for in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (f) The Administrator may revoke a certificate of conformity for a 
family when the certificate has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) 
or (c) of this section if the proposed remedy for the nonconformity, as 
reported by the manufacturer to the Administrator, is one requiring a 
design change or changes to the engine and/or emission control system as 
described in the application for certification of the affected family.
    (g) Once a certificate has been suspended for a failed engine, as 
provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the manufacturer must 
take the following actions before the certificate is reinstated for that 
failed engine:
    (1) Remedy the nonconformity.
    (2) Demonstrate that the engine conforms to applicable standards or 
family emission levels by retesting the engine in accordance with these 
regulations.
    (3) Submit a written report to the Administrator, after successful 
completion of testing on the failed engine, which contains a description 
of the remedy and test results for each engine in addition to other 
information that may be required by this part.
    (h) Once a certificate for a failed family has been suspended 
pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the manufacturer must 
take the following actions before the Administrator will consider 
reinstating the certificate:
    (1) Submit a written report to the Administrator which identifies 
the reason for the noncompliance of the engines, describes the proposed 
remedy, including a description of any proposed quality control and/or 
quality assurance measures to be taken by the manufacturer to prevent 
future occurrences of the problem, and states the date on which the 
remedies will be implemented.
    (2) Demonstrate that the engine family for which the certificate of 
conformity has been suspended does in fact comply with these regulations 
by testing engines selected from normal production runs of that engine 
family, at the plant(s), port facility(ies) or associated storage 
facility(ies) specified by the Administrator, in accordance with

[[Page 113]]

the conditions specified in the initial test order. If the manufacturer 
elects to continue testing individual engines after suspension of a 
certificate, the certificate is reinstated for an engine actually 
determined to be in conformance with the applicable standards or family 
emission levels through testing in accordance with the applicable test 
procedures, provided that the Administrator has not revoked the 
certificate pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.
    (i) Once the certificate for a family has been revoked under 
paragraph (f) of this section and the manufacturer desires to continue 
introduction into commerce of a modified version of that family, the 
following actions must be taken before the Administrator may consider 
issuing a certificate for that modified family:
    (1) If the Administrator determines that the proposed change(s) in 
engine design may have an effect on emission performance deterioration, 
the Administrator will notify the manufacturer, within five working days 
after receipt of the report in paragraph (g) of this section, whether 
subsequent testing under this subpart is sufficient to evaluate the 
proposed change or changes or whether additional testing is required; 
and
    (2) After implementing the change or changes intended to remedy the 
nonconformity, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the modified 
engine family does in fact conform with these regulations by testing 
engines selected from normal production runs of that modified engine 
family in accordance with the conditions specified in the initial test 
order. If the subsequent audit results in passing of the audit, the 
Administrator will reissue the certificate or issue a new certificate, 
as the case may be, to include that family, provided that the 
manufacturer has satisfied the testing requirements of paragraph (i)(1) 
of this section. If the subsequent audit is failed, the revocation 
remains in effect. Any design change approvals under this subpart are 
limited to the family affected by the test order.
    (j) At any time subsequent to an initial suspension of a certificate 
of conformity for a test engine pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section, but not later than 15 days (or such other period as may be 
allowed by the Administrator) after notification of the Administrator's 
decision to suspend or revoke a certificate of conformity in whole or in 
part pursuant to paragraph (b), (c), or (f) of this section, a 
manufacturer may request a hearing as to whether the tests have been 
properly conducted or any sampling methods have been properly applied.
    (k) Any suspension of a certificate of conformity under paragraph 
(d) of this section:
    (1) will be in writing and will include the offer of an opportunity 
for a hearing conducted in accordance with Secs. 89.512-96, 89.513-96, 
and 89.514-96 and
    (2) need not apply to engines no longer in the hands of the 
manufacturer.
    (l) After the Administrator suspends or revokes a certificate of 
conformity pursuant to this section and prior to the commencement of a 
hearing under Sec. 89.512-96, if the manufacturer demonstrates to the 
Administrator's satisfaction that the decision to suspend, revoke, or 
void the certificate was based on erroneous information, the 
Administrator will reinstate the certificate.
    (m) To permit a manufacturer to avoid storing non-test engines when 
conducting an audit of a family subsequent to a failure of an SEA and 
while reauditing of the failed family, it may request that the 
Administrator conditionally reinstate the certificate for that family. 
The Administrator may reinstate the certificate subject to the condition 
that the manufacturer consents to recall all engines of that family 
produced from the time the certificate is conditionally reinstated if 
the family fails the subsequent audit at the level of the standard and 
to remedy any nonconformity at no expense to the owner.


<R05>
Sec. 89.512-96  Request for public hearing.

    (a) If the manufacturer disagrees with the Administrator's decision 
under Sec. 89.511-96 (b), (c), (d), or (f) to suspend or revoke a 
certificate or disputes the basis for an automatic suspension pursuant 
to Sec. 89.511-96 (a), the

[[Page 114]]

manufacturer may request a public hearing.
    (b) The manufacturer's request must be filed with the Administrator 
not later than 15 days after the Administrator's notification of the 
decision to suspend or revoke, unless otherwise specified by the 
Administrator. The manufacturer must simultaneously serve two copies of 
this request upon the Director of the Manufacturers Operations Division 
and file two copies with the Hearing Clerk of the Agency. Failure of the 
manufacturer to request a hearing within the time provided constitutes a 
waiver of the right to a hearing. Subsequent to the expiration of the 
period for requesting a hearing as of right, the Administrator may, at 
her or his discretion and for good cause shown, grant the manufacturer a 
hearing to contest the suspension or revocation.
    (c) The manufacturer's request for a public hearing must include:
    (1) A statement as to which engine configuration(s) within a family 
is to be the subject of the hearing;
    (2) A concise statement of the issues to be raised by the 
manufacturer at the hearing, except that in the case of the hearing 
requested under Sec. 89.511-96(j), the hearing is restricted to the 
following issues:
    (i) Whether tests have been properly conducted, specifically, 
whether the tests were conducted in accordance with applicable 
regulations under this part and whether test equipment was properly 
calibrated and functioning;
    (ii) Whether sampling plans have been properly applied, 
specifically, whether sampling procedures specified in appendix A of 
this subpart were followed and whether there exists a basis for 
distinguishing engines produced at plants other than the one from which 
engines were selected for testing which would invalidate the 
Administrator's decision under Sec. 89.511-96(c);
    (3) A statement specifying reasons why the manufacturer believes it 
will prevail on the merits of each of the issues raised; and
    (4) A summary of the evidence which supports the manufacturer's 
position on each of the issues raised.
    (d) A copy of all requests for public hearings will be kept on file 
in the Office of the Hearing Clerk and will be made available to the 
public during Agency business hours.

<R04>
         Subpart G--Importation of Nonconforming Nonroad Engines


<R05>
Sec. 89.601-96  Applicability.

    (a) Except where otherwise indicated, this subpart is applicable to 
nonroad engines for which the Administrator has promulgated regulations 
under this part prescribing emission standards and nonroad vehicles and 
equipment

[[Page 118]]

containing such nonroad engines that are offered for importation or 
imported into the United States, but which engines, at the time of 
conditional importation, are not covered by certificates of conformity 
issued under section 213 and section 206(a) of the Clean Air Act as 
amended (that is, which are nonconforming nonroad engines as defined in 
Sec. 89.602-96), and this part. Compliance with regulations under this 
subpart does not relieve any person or entity from compliance with other 
applicable provisions of the Clean Air Act.
    (b) Regulations prescribing further procedures for the importation 
of nonroad engines and nonroad vehicles and equipment into the customs 
territory of the United States, as defined in 19 U.S.C. 1202, are set 
forth in U.S. Bureau of Customs regulations.
    (c) For the purposes of this subpart, the term ``nonroad engine'' 
includes all nonroad engines incorporated into nonroad equipment or 
nonroad vehicles at the time they are imported or offered for import 
into the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 89.602-96  Definitions.

    The definitions in subpart A of this part apply to this subpart. The 
following definitions also apply to this subpart.
    Certificate of conformity. The document issued by the Administrator 
under section 213 and section 206(a) of the Act.
    Currently valid certificate of conformity. A certificate of 
conformity for which the current date is within the effective period as 
specified on the certificate of conformity, and which has not been 
withdrawn, superseded, voided, suspended, revoked, or otherwise rendered 
invalid.
    Fifteen working day hold period. The period of time between a 
request for final admission and the automatic granting of final 
admission (unless EPA intervenes) for a nonconforming nonroad engine 
conditionally imported pursuant to Sec. 89.605-96 or Sec. 89.609-96. Day 
one of the hold period is the first working day (see definition below) 
after the Manufacturers Operations Division of EPA receives a complete 
and valid application for final admission.
    Independent commercial importer (ICI). An importer who is not an 
original engine manufacturer (OEM) (see definition below), but is the 
entity in whose name a certificate of conformity for a class of nonroad 
engines has been issued.
    Model year for imported engines. The manufacturer's annual 
production period (as determined by the Administrator) which includes 
January 1 of the calendar year; provided, that if the manufacturer has 
no annual production period, the term ``model year'' means the calendar 
year in which a nonroad engine is modified. An independent commercial 
importer (ICI) is deemed to have produced a nonroad engine when the ICI 
has modified (including labeling) the nonconforming nonroad engine to 
meet applicable emission requirements.
    Nonconforming nonroad engine. A nonroad engine which is not covered 
by a certificate of conformity prior to final or conditional admission 
(or for which such coverage has not been adequately demonstrated to EPA) 
and which has not been finally admitted into the United States under the 
provisions of Sec. 89.605-96 or Sec. 89.609-96.
    Original engine manufacturer (OEM). The entity which originally 
manufactured the nonroad engine.
    Original production (OP) year. The calendar year in which the 
nonroad engine was originally produced by the OEM.
    Original production (OP) years old. The age of a nonroad engine as 
determined by subtracting the original production year of the nonroad 
engine from the calendar year of importation.
    Production changes. Those changes in nonroad engine configuration, 
equipment, or calibration which are made by an OEM or ICI in the course 
of nonroad engine production and required to be reported under 
Sec. 89.123-96.
    United States. United States includes the customs territory of the 
United States as defined in 19 U.S.C. 1202, and the Virgin Islands, 
Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
Islands.
    Useful life. A period of time as specified in subpart B of this part 
which for a nonconforming nonroad engine begins at the time of resale

<R05>
Sec. 89.604-96  Conditional admission.

    (a) A nonroad engine offered for importation under Sec. 89.605-96 or 
Sec. 89.609-96 may be conditionally admitted into the United States. 
These engines are refused final admission, unless at the time of 
conditional admission the importer has submitted to the Administrator a 
written report that the subject nonroad engine has been permitted 
conditional admission pending EPA approval of its application for final 
admission under Sec. 89.605-96 or Sec. 89.609-96. This written report is 
to contain the following:
    (1) Identification of the importer of the nonroad engine and the 
importer's address, telephone number, and taxpayer identification 
number;
    (2) Identification of the nonroad engine owner, the owner's address, 
telephone number, and taxpayer identification number;
    (3) Identification of the nonroad engine including make, model, 
identification number, and original production year;
    (4) Information indicating under what provision of these regulations 
the nonroad engine is to be imported;
    (5) Identification of the place where the subject nonroad engine is 
to be stored until EPA approval of the importer's application to the 
Administrator for final admission;
    (6) Authorization for EPA enforcement officers to conduct 
inspections or testing otherwise permitted by the Act or regulations 
thereunder;
    (7) Identification of the Independent Commercial Importer's (ICI) 
certificate of conformity that permits the ICI to import that nonroad 
engine (for importation under Sec. 89.605-96 or Sec. 89.609-96); and
    (8) Such other information as is deemed necessary by the 
Administrator.
    (b) EPA will not require a U.S. Customs Service bond for a 
nonconforming nonroad engine which is imported

[[Page 120]]

under Sec. 89.605-96 or Sec. 89.609-96. The period of conditional 
admission may not exceed 120 days. Nonroad engines imported under 
Sec. 89.605-96 or Sec. 89.609-96 may not be operated during the period 
of conditional admission except for that operation necessary to comply 
with the requirements of this subpart. During the period of conditional 
admission applicable to Sec. 89.605-96 or Sec. 89.609-96, the importer 
must store the nonroad engine at a location where the Administrator has 
reasonable access to the nonroad engine for inspection.
    (c) During the period of conditional admission under Sec. 89.605-96 
or Sec. 89.609-96, an ICI may transfer responsibility of a nonroad 
engine to another qualified ICI for the purposes of complying with this 
subpart.
    (1) The transferee ICI must be a holder of a currently valid 
certificate of conformity for the specific nonroad engine being 
transferred or be authorized to import the nonroad engine pursuant to 
Sec. 89.609-96 as of the transfer date. The transferee ICI must comply 
with all the requirements of Sec. 89.603-96, Sec. 89.604-96, and either 
Sec. 89.605-96 or Sec. 89.609-96, as applicable.
    (2) For the purpose of this subpart, the transferee ICI has 
``imported'' the nonroad engine as of the transfer date as designated in 
a written record that is signed by both ICIs.
    (3) The ICI that originally imported the nonroad engine is 
responsible for all requirements of this subpart from the actual date of 
importation until the date of transfer as designated in the written 
record. The transferee ICI is responsible for all requirements of this 
subpart beginning on the date of transfer.
    (4) A copy of the written record is to be submitted to the 
Manufacturers Operations Division of EPA within five working days of the 
transfer date.
    (d) Notwithstanding any other requirement of this subpart or U.S. 
Customs Service regulations, an ICI may also assume responsibility for 
the modification and testing of a nonconforming nonroad engine which was 
previously imported by another party. The ICI must be a holder of a 
currently valid certificate of conformity for that specific nonroad 
engine or authorized to import it pursuant to Sec. 89.609-96 at the time 
of assuming such responsibility. The ICI must comply with all the 
requirements of Sec. 89.603-96, Sec. 89.604-96, and either Sec. 89.605-
96 or Sec. 89.609-96, as applicable. For the purposes of this subpart, 
the ICI has ``imported'' the nonroad engine as of the date the ICI 
assumes responsibility for the modification and testing of the nonroad 
engine. The ICI must submit written notification to the Manufacturers 
Operations Division of EPA within 10 working days of the assumption of 
that responsibility.


<R05>
Sec. 89.605-96  Final admission of certified nonroad engines.

    (a) A nonroad engine may be finally admitted into the United States 
upon approval of the ICI's application to the Administrator. The 
application is made by completing EPA forms in accordance with EPA 
instructions. The application contains:
    (1) The information required in Sec. 89.604-96(a);
    (2) Information demonstrating that the nonroad engine has been 
modified in accordance with a valid certificate of conformity. 
Demonstration is made in one of the following ways:
    (i) The ICI attests that the nonroad engine has been modified in 
accordance with the provisions of the ICI's certificate of conformity; 
presents to EPA a statement written by the applicable Original Engine 
Manufacturer (OEM) that the OEM must provide to the ICI, and to EPA, 
information concerning production changes to the class of nonroad 
engines described in the ICI's application for certification; delivers 
to the Manufacturers Operations Division of EPA notification by the ICI 
of any production changes already implemented by the OEM at the time of 
application and their effect on emissions; and obtains from EPA written 
approval to use this demonstration option; or
    (ii) The ICI attests that the nonroad engine has been modified in 
accordance with the provisions of the ICI's certificate of conformity. 
The ICI also attests that it has conducted, within 120 days of entry, an 
applicable and valid emission test on every third nonroad engine 
imported under that certificate of conformity to demonstrate compliance 
with federal emission requirements.

[[Page 121]]

The test is to be conducted at a laboratory located within the United 
States. Sequencing of the tests is determined by the date of importation 
of each nonroad engine beginning with the prototype nonroad engine used 
to obtain the applicable certificate of conformity. Should the ICI 
exceed a threshold of 300 nonroad engines imported under the certificate 
of conformity without adjustments or other changes in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the amount of required testing is 
reduced to every fifth nonroad engine.
    (3) The results of every emission test which the ICI conducted on 
the nonroad engine pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. 
Should a subject nonroad engine fail an emission test at any time, the 
following procedures are applicable:
    (i) The ICI may either:
    (A) Conduct one retest that involves no adjustment of the nonroad 
engine from the previous test (for example, adjusting the RPM, timing, 
air-to-fuel ratio, and so forth) other than adjustments to adjustable 
parameters that, upon inspection, were found to be out of tolerance. 
When such an allowable adjustment is made, the parameter may be reset 
only to the specified (that is, nominal) value (and not any other value 
within the tolerance band); or
    (B) Initiate a change in production (production change) under the 
provisions of subpart B of this part that causes the nonroad engine to 
meet federal emission requirements.
    (ii) If the ICI chooses to retest in accordance with paragraph 
(a)(3)(i)(A) of this section:
    (A) The retests are to be completed no later than five working days 
subsequent to the first emission test;
    (B) Should the subject nonroad engine fail the second emission test, 
then the ICI must initiate a change in production (a production change) 
under the provisions of subpart B of this part that causes the nonroad 
engine to meet federal emission requirements.
    (iii) If the ICI chooses to initiate a change in production (a 
production change) under the provisions of subpart B of this part that 
causes the nonroad engine to meet federal requirements, a change 
involving adjustments of adjustable nonroad engine parameters (for 
example, adjusting the RPM, timing, air/fuel ratio) represents a change 
in the specified (that is, nominal) value to be deemed acceptable by 
EPA.
    (iv) A production change made in accordance with this section is to 
be implemented on all subsequent nonroad engines imported under the 
certificate of conformity after the date of importation of the nonroad 
engine which gave rise to the production change.
    (v) Commencing with the first nonroad engine receiving the 
production change, every third nonroad engine imported under the 
certificate of conformity is to be emission tested to demonstrate 
compliance with federal emission requirements until, as in paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii) of this section, a threshold of 300 nonroad engines imported 
under the certificate of conformity is exceeded without adjustments or 
other changes in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section, 
at which time the amount of required emission testing is reduced to 
every fifth nonroad engine.
    (vi) A report concerning these production changes is to be made to 
both the Manufacturers Operations and Certification Divisions of EPA 
within ten working days of initiation of the production change. The 
cause of any failure of an emission test is to be identified, if known;
    (4) The applicable deterioration factor, if any;
    (5) The emission test results adjusted by the deterioration factor;
    (6) Other information that may be specified by applicable 
regulations or on the certificate of conformity under which the nonroad 
engine has been modified in order to assure compliance with requirements 
of the Act;
    (7) All information required under Sec. 89.610-96 related to 
maintenance, warranties, and labeling;
    (8) An attestation by the ICI that the ICI is responsible for the 
nonroad engine's compliance with federal emission requirements, 
regardless of whether the ICI owns the nonroad engine imported under 
this section;
    (9) The name, address, and telephone number of the person who the 
ICI prefers to receive EPA notification under Sec. 89.605-96(c);

[[Page 122]]

    (10) An attestation by the ICI that all requirements of Sec. 89.607-
96 and Sec. 89.610-96 have been met; and
    (11) Other information as is deemed necessary by the Administrator.
    (b) EPA approval for final admission of a nonroad engine under this 
section is to be presumed not to have been granted if a requirement of 
this subpart has not been met. This includes, but is not limited to, 
properly modifying the nonroad engine to be in conformity in all 
material respects with the description in the application for 
certification or not complying with the provisions of Sec. 89.605-
96(a)(2) or if the final emission test results, adjusted by the 
deterioration factor, if applicable, do not comply with applicable 
emission standards.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, EPA 
approval for final admission of a nonroad engine under this section is 
presumed to have been granted if the ICI does not receive oral or 
written notice from EPA to the contrary within 15 working days of the 
date that the Manufacturers Operations Division of EPA receives the 
ICI's application under paragraph (a) of this section. EPA notice of 
nonapproval may be made to any employee of the ICI. It is the 
responsibility of the ICI to ensure that the Manufacturers Operations 
Division of EPA receives the application and to confirm the date of 
receipt. During this 15 working day hold period, the nonroad engine is 
to be stored at a location where the Administrator has reasonable access 
to the nonroad engine for the Administrator's inspection. The storage is 
to be within 50 miles of the ICI's testing facility to allow the 
Administrator reasonable access for inspection and/or testing. A storage 
facility not meeting this criterion must be approved in writing by the 
Administrator prior to the submittal of the ICI's application under 
paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 89.606-96  Inspection and testing of imported nonroad engines.

containing the records for that nonroad engine.
    (3) The maintenance and use instructions are not to contain 
requirements more restrictive than those set forth in Sec. 89.109-96 
(Maintenance Instructions) and are to be in sufficient detail and 
clarity that a mechanic of average training and ability can maintain or 
repair the nonroad engine.
    (4) For each nonroad engine imported pursuant to Sec. 89.605-96 or 
Sec. 89.609-96, ICIs must furnish with each nonroad engine a list of the 
emission control parts, emission-related parts added by the ICI, and the 
emission control and emission-related parts furnished by the Original 
Engine Manufacturer (OEM).

[[Page 126]]

    (5) The information required in this section to be furnished to the 
ultimate purchaser or owner is to be copied and maintained in a file 
containing the records for that nonroad engine prior to submitting each 
application for final admission pursuant to Sec. 89.605-96(a) or 
Sec. 89.609-96(b).
    (b) Warranties. (1) ICIs must submit to the Manufacturers Operations 
Division of EPA sample copies (including revisions) of any warranty 
documents required by this section prior to importing nonroad engines 
under this subpart.
    (2) ICIs must provide to nonroad engine owners emission warranties 
identical to those required by sections 207(a) of the Act. The warranty 
period for each nonroad engine is to commence on the date the nonroad 
engine is delivered by the ICI to the ultimate purchaser or owner.
    (3) ICIs must provide warranty insurance coverage by a prepaid 
mandatory service insurance policy underwritten by an independent 
insurance company. The policy is to:
    (i) Be subject to the approval of the Administrator if the insurance 
coverage is less than the required warranty;
    (ii) At a minimum, provide coverage for emission-related components 
installed or modified by the ICI and, to the maximum extent possible, 
the emission-related components installed by the OEM;
    (iii) Be transferable to each successive owner for the periods 
specified in Sec. 89.104-96(c); and
    (iv) Provide that in the absence of an ICI's facility being 
reasonably available (that is, within 50 miles) for performance of 
warranty repairs, the warranty repairs may be performed anywhere.
    (4) ICIs must attest in each application for final admission that 
the warranty requirements have been met, that the mandatory insurance 
has been paid and is in effect, and that certificates and statements of 
the warranties have been or will be provided to the owner or ultimate 
purchaser. A copy of the warranties and evidence that the warranties are 
paid and in effect is to be maintained in a file containing the records 
for each nonroad engine prior to submitting each application for final 
admission pursuant to Sec. 89.605-96(a) or Sec. 89.609-96(b).
    (c) Emission labeling. (1) For each nonroad engine imported pursuant 
to Sec. 89.605-96 or Sec. 89.609-96, the ICI must affix a permanent 
legible label which identifies each nonroad engine and also satisfies 
the following:
    (i) The label meets all the requirements of Sec. 89.110-96 and 
contains the following statement ``This nonroad engine was originally 
produced in (month and year of original production). It has been 
imported and modified by (ICI's name, address, and telephone number) to 
conform to United States emission regulations applicable to the (year) 
model year.''
    (ii) If the nonroad engine is owned by the ICI at the time of 
importation, the label also states ``This nonroad engine is warranted 
for five years or 3000 hours of operation from the date of purchase, 
whichever first occurs.''
    (iii) If the nonroad engine is not owned by the ICI at the time of 
importation, the label states ``This nonroad engine is warranted for 
five years or 3000 hours of operation from the date of release to the 
owner, whichever first occurs.''
    (iv) For nonroad engines imported under Sec. 89.609-96, the label 
clearly states in bold letters that ``This nonroad engine has not been 
manufactured under a certificate of conformity but conforms to United 
States emission regulations under a modification/test program.'' For all 
nonroad engines imported pursuant to Sec. 89.605-96 or Sec. 89.609-96, 
the label contains the vacuum hose routing diagram applicable to the 
nonroad engines.
    (2) As part of the application to the Administrator for final 
admission of each individual nonroad engine under Sec. 89.609-96, the 
ICI must maintain a copy of the labels for each nonroad engine in a file 
containing the records for that nonroad engine prior to submitting each 
application for final admission. ICIs importing under Sec. 89.605-96 or 
Sec. 89.609-96 must attest to compliance with the preceding labeling 
requirements of this section in each application for final admission.

<R05>
Sec. 89.611-96  Exemptions and exclusions.

    (a) Individuals, as well as ICIs, are eligible for importing nonroad 
engines into the United States under the provisions of this section, 
unless otherwise specified.
    (b) Notwithstanding other requirements of this subpart, a nonroad 
engine entitled to one of the temporary exemptions of this paragraph may 
be conditionally admitted into the United States if prior written 
approval for the conditional admission is obtained from the 
Administrator. Conditional admission is to be under bond. The 
Administrator may request that the U.S. Customs Service require a 
specific bond amount to ensure compliance with the requirements of the 
Act and this subpart. A written request for approval from the 
Administrator is to contain the identification required in Sec. 89.604-
96(a) (except for Sec. 89.604-96(a)(5)) and information that 
demonstrates that the importer is entitled to the exemption. 
Noncompliance with provisions of this section may result in the 
forfeiture of the total amount of the bond or exportation of the nonroad 
engine. The following temporary exemptions are permitted by this 
paragraph:
    (1) Exemption for repairs or alterations. Upon written approval by 
EPA, an owner of nonroad engines may conditionally import under bond 
such nonroad engines solely for purpose of repair(s) or alteration(s). 
The nonroad engines may not be operated in the United States other than 
for the sole purpose of repair or alteration. They may not be sold or 
leased in the United States and are to be exported upon completion of 
the repair(s) or alteration(s).
    (2) Testing exemption. A test nonroad engine may be conditionally 
imported by a person subject to the requirements of Sec. 89.905. A test 
nonroad engine may be operated in the United States provided that the 
operation is an integral part of the test. This exemption is limited to 
a period not exceeding one year from the date of importation unless a 
request is made by the appropriate importer concerning the nonroad 
engine in accordance with Sec. 89.905(f) for a subsequent one-year 
period.
    (3) Precertification exemption. A prototype nonroad engine for use 
in applying to EPA for certification pursuant to this subpart may be 
conditionally imported subject to applicable provisions of Sec. 89.906 
and the following requirements:
    (i) No more than one prototype nonroad engine for each engine family 
for which an importer is seeking certification is to be imported.
    (ii) The granting of precertification exemptions by the 
Administrator is discretionary. Normally, no more than three outstanding 
precertification exemptions are allowed for each importer. No 
precertification exemption is allowed if the importer requesting the 
exemption is in noncompliance with any requirement of this subpart until 
the noncompliance is corrected.
    (iii) Unless a certificate of conformity is issued for the prototype 
nonroad engine and the nonroad engine is finally admitted pursuant to 
the requirements of Sec. 89.605 within 180 days from the date of entry, 
the total amount of the bond is to be forfeited or the nonroad engine 
exported unless an extension is granted by the Administrator. A request 
for an extension is to be in writing and received by the Administrator 
prior to the date that the precertification exemption expires.
    (iv) Such precertification nonroad engine may not be operated in the 
United States other than for the sole purpose of the precertification 
exemption.
    (4) Display exemptions. (i) A nonroad engine intended solely for 
display may be conditionally imported subject to the requirements of 
Sec. 89.907.
    (ii) A display nonroad engine may be imported by any person for 
purposes related to a business or the public interest. Such purposes do 
not include collections normally inaccessible or unavailable to the 
public on a daily basis, display of a nonroad engine at a dealership, 
private use, or other purpose that the Administrator determines is not 
appropriate for display exemptions. A display nonroad engine may not be 
sold in the United States and may not be operated in the United States 
except for the operation incident and necessary to the display purpose.

[[Page 128]]

    (iii) A temporary display exemption is granted for 12 months or for 
the duration of the display purpose, whichever is shorter. Two 
extensions of up to 12 months each are available upon approval by the 
Administrator. In no circumstances, however, may the total period of 
exemption exceed 36 months. The U.S. Customs Service bonds a temporary 
display exemption.
    (c) Notwithstanding any other requirement of this subpart, a nonroad 
engine may be finally admitted into the United States under this 
paragraph if prior written approval for such final admission is obtained 
from the Administrator. Conditional admission of these nonroad engines 
under this subpart is not permitted for the purpose of obtaining such 
written approval from the Administrator. A request for approval is to 
contain the identification information required in Sec. 89.604-96(a) 
(except for Sec. 89.604-96(a)(5)) and information that demonstrates that 
the importer is entitled to the exemption or exclusion. The following 
exemptions or exclusions are permitted by this paragraph:
    (1) National security exemption. A nonroad engine may be imported 
under the national security exemption found at Sec. 89.908.
    (2) Hardship exemption. The Administrator may exempt on a case-by-
case basis a nonroad engine from federal emission requirements to 
accommodate unforeseen cases of extreme hardship or extraordinary 
circumstances.
    (3) Exemption for nonroad engines identical to United States 
certified versions.
    (i) A person (including businesses) is eligible for importing a 
nonroad engine into the United States under the provisions of this 
paragraph. An exemption will be granted if the nonroad engine:
    (A) is owned by the importer;
    (B) is not offered for importation for the purpose of resale; and
    (C) is proven to be identical, in all material respects, to a 
nonroad engine certified by the Original Engine Manufacturer (OEM) for 
sale in the United States or is proven to have been modified to be 
identical, in all material respects, to a nonroad engine certified by 
the OEM for sale in the United States according to complete written 
instructions provided by the OEM's United States representative, or his/
her designee.
    (ii) Proof of Conformity. (A) Documentation submitted pursuant to 
this section for the purpose of proving conformity of individual nonroad 
engines is to contain sufficiently organized data or evidence 
demonstrating that the nonroad engine identified pursuant to 
Sec. 89.604-96(a) is identical, in all material respects, to a nonroad 
engine identified in an OEM's application for certification.
    (B) If the documentation does not contain all the information 
required by this part, or is not sufficiently organized, EPA notifies 
the importer of any areas of inadequacy, and that the documentation does 
not receive further consideration until the required information or 
organization is provided.
    (C) If EPA determines that the documentation does not clearly or 
sufficiently demonstrate that a nonroad engine is eligible for 
importation, EPA notifies the importer in writing.
    (D) If EPA determines that the documentation clearly and 
sufficiently demonstrates that a nonroad engine is eligible for 
importation, EPA grants approval for importation and notifies the 
importer in writing. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this 
subpart, the notice constitutes approval for final admission into the 
United States.
    (d) Foreign diplomatic and military personnel may import a 
nonconforming nonroad engine without bond. At the time of admission, the 
importer must submit to the Administrator the written report required in 
Sec. 89.604-96(a) (except for information required by Sec. 89.604-
96(a)(5)) and a statement from the U.S. Department of State confirming 
qualification for this exemption. The nonroad engine may not be sold in 
the United States and must be exported if the individual's diplomatic 
status is no longer applicable, as determined by the Department of 
State, unless subsequently brought into conformity in accordance with 
Secs. 89.605-96, 89.609-96, or 89.611-96(c)(3).
    (e) Competition exclusion. A nonconforming engine may be imported by 
any person provided the importer demonstrates to the Administrator that 
the engine is used to propel a vehicle

[[Page 129]]

used solely for competition and obtains prior written approval from the 
Administrator. A nonconforming engine imported pursuant to this 
paragraph may not be operated in the United States except for that 
operation incident and necessary for the competition purpose, unless 
subsequently brought into conformity with United States emission 
requirements in accordance with Secs. 89.605-96, 89.609-96, or 89.611-
96(c)(3).
    (f) Exclusions/exemptions based on date of original manufacture. (1) 
Notwithstanding any other requirements of this subpart, the following 
nonroad engines are excluded, as determined by the engine's gross power 
output, from the requirements of the Act in accordance with section 213 
of the Act and may be imported by any person:
    (i) All nonroad engines greater than or equal to 37 kW but less than 
75 kW originally manufactured prior to January 1, 1998.
    (ii) All nonroad engines greater than or equal to 75 kW but less 
than 130 kW originally manufactured prior to January 1, 1997.

than or equal to 560 kW originally manufactured prior to January 1, 
1996.
    (iv) All nonroad engines greater than 560 kW originally manufactured 
prior to January 1, 2000.
    (2) Notwithstanding other requirements of this subpart, a nonroad 
engine not subject to an exclusion under Sec. 89.611-96(f)(1) but 
greater than 20 original production (OP) years old is entitled to an 
exemption from the requirements of the Act, provided that it has not 
been modified in those 20 OP years and it is imported into the United 
States by an ICI. At the time of admission, the ICI must submit to the 
Administrator the written report required in Sec. 89.604-96(a) (except 
for information required by Sec. 89.604-96(a)(5)).
    (g) An application for exemption and exclusion provided for in 
paragraphs (b), (c), and (e) of this section is to be mailed to: U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Mobile Sources, Manufacturers 
Operations Division (6405-J), 401 M Street, SW, Washington, DC 20460, 
Attention: Imports.


<R05>
Sec. 89.612-96  Prohibited acts; penalties.

    (a) The importation of a nonroad engine, including a nonroad engine 
incorporated into a nonroad vehicle or nonroad equipment, which is not 
covered by a certificate of conformity other than in accordance with 
this subpart and the entry regulations of the U.S. Customs Service is 
prohibited. Failure to comply with this section is a violation of 
section 213(d) and section 203 of the Act.
    (b) Unless otherwise permitted by this subpart, during a period of 
conditional admission, the importer of a nonroad engine may not:
    (1) Register, license, or operate the nonroad engine in the United 
States;
    (2) Sell or offer the nonroad engine for sale;
    (3) Store the nonroad engine on the premises of a dealer (unless 
approved by the Administrator), owner, or purchaser;
    (4) Relinquish control of the nonroad engine to the owner or 
purchaser; or
    (5) Cause a nonroad engine to be altered in any manner subsequent to 
modification and testing, if applicable, for which an application for 
final admission is based and submitted to the Administrator, unless 
approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (c) A nonroad engine conditionally admitted pursuant to Sec. 89.604-
96 and not granted final admission within 120 days of such conditional 
admission, or within such additional time as the Administrator and the 
U.S. Customs Service may allow, is deemed to be unlawfully imported into 
the United States in violation of section 213(d) and section 203 of the 
Act, unless the nonroad engine has been delivered to the U.S. Customs 
Service for export or other disposition under applicable Customs laws 
and regulations. A nonroad engine not so delivered is subject to seizure 
by the U.S. Customs Service.
    (d) An importer who violates section 213(d) and section 203 of the 
Act is subject to the provisions of section 209 of the Act and is also 
subject to a civil penalty under section 205 of the Act of not more than 
$25,000 for each nonroad engine subject to the violation. In addition to 
the penalty provided in the Act, where applicable, a person or entity

[[Page 130]]

who imports an engine under the exemption provisions of Sec. 89.611-
96(b) and, who fails to deliver the nonroad engine to the U.S. Customs 
Service is liable for liquidated damages in the amount of the bond 
required by applicable Customs laws and regulations.
    (e)(1) An ICI whose nonroad engines imported under Sec. 89.605-96 or 
Sec. 89.609-96 fail to conform to federal emission requirements after 
modification and/or testing or who fails to comply with applicable 
provisions of this subpart, may, in addition to any other applicable 
sanctions and penalties, be subject to any, or all, of the following 
sanctions:
    (i) The ICI's currently held certificates of conformity may be 
revoked or suspended;
    (ii) The ICI may be deemed ineligible to apply for new certificates 
of conformity for up to three years; and
    (iii) The ICI may be deemed ineligible to import nonroad engines 
under Sec. 89.609-96 in the future and be placed on a list of ICIs 
ineligible to import nonroad engines under the provisions of 
Sec. 89.609-96.
    (2) Grounds for the actions described in paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (i) Action or inaction by the ICI or the laboratory performing the 
emission test on behalf of the ICI, which results in fraudulent, 
deceitful, or grossly inaccurate representation of any fact or condition 
which affects a nonroad engine's eligibility for admission to the United 
States under this subpart;
    (ii) Failure of a significant number of imported nonroad engines to 
comply with federal emission requirements upon EPA inspection or retest; 
or
    (iii) Failure by an ICI to comply with requirements of this subpart.
    (3) The following procedures govern any decision to suspend, revoke, 
or refuse to issue certificates of conformity under this subpart:
    (i) When grounds appear to exist for the actions described in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Administrator must notify the ICI 
in writing of any intended suspension or revocation of a certificate of 
conformity, proposed ineligibility to apply for new certificates of 
conformity, or intended suspension of eligibility to conduct 
modification/testing under Sec. 89.609-96, and the grounds for such 
action.
    (ii) Except as provided by paragraph (e)(3)(iv), the ICI must take 
the following actions before the Administrator will consider withdrawing 
notice of intent to suspend or revoke the ICI's certificate of 
conformity or to deem the ICI ineligible to apply for new certification 
or to deem the ICI ineligible to perform modification/testing under 
Sec. 89.609-96:
    (A) Submit a written report to the Administrator which identifies 
the reason for the noncompliance of the nonroad engine, describes the 
proposed remedy, including a description of any proposed quality control 
and/or quality assurance measures to be taken by the ICI to prevent the 
future occurrence of the problem, and states the date on which the 
remedies are to be implemented or
    (B) Demonstrate that the nonroad engine does in fact comply with 
applicable regulations in this chapter by retesting, if applicable, the 
nonroad engine in accordance with the applicable emission test specified 
in subpart E of this part.
    (iii) An ICI may request, within 15 calendar days of the 
Administrator's notice of intent to suspend or revoke the ICI's 
certificate of conformity or to deem the ICI ineligible to apply for new 
certificates or to deem the ICI ineligible to perform modification/
testing under Sec. 89.609- 96, that the Administrator grant such ICI a 
hearing:
    (A) As to whether the tests, if applicable, have been properly 
conducted,
    (B) As to any substantial factual issue raised by the 
Administrator's proposed action.
    (iv) If, after the Administrator notifies an ICI of the intent to 
suspend or revoke the ICI's certificate of conformity or to deem the ICI 
ineligible to apply for new certificates or to deem the ICI ineligible 
to perform modification/testing under Sec. 89.609-96 and prior to any 
final suspension or revocation, the ICI demonstrates to the 
Administrator's satisfaction that the decision to initiate suspension or 
revocation of the certificate of conformity or eligibility to perform 
modification/testing

[[Page 131]]

under Sec. 89.609-96 was based on erroneous information, the 
Administrator will withdraw the notice of intent.
    (4) Hearings on suspensions and revocations of certificates of 
conformity or of eligibility to apply for new certificates or of 
eligibility to perform modification/testing under Sec. 89.609-96 will be 
held in accordance with the following:
    (i) The procedures prescribed by this section will apply whenever an 
ICI requests a hearing pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this 
section.
    (ii) Hearings under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) will be held in accordance 
with the procedures outlined in Sec. 86.614 of this chapter, where 
applicable, provided that where Sec. 86.612 is referred to in 
Sec. 86.614: Sec. 86.612(a) is replaced by Sec. 89.612-96(e)(2); and 
Sec. 86.612(i) is replaced by Sec. 89.612-96(e)(3)(iii).
    (5) When a hearing is requested under this section and it clearly 
appears from the data or other information contained in the request for 
a hearing, or submitted at the hearing, that no genuine and substantial 
question of fact exists with respect to the issue of whether the ICI 
failed to comply with this subpart, the Administrator will enter an 
order denying the request for a hearing, or terminating the hearing, and 
suspending or revoking the certificate of conformity and/or deeming the 
ICI ineligible to apply for new certificates or to perform modification/
testing under Sec. 89.609-96.
    (6) In lieu of requesting a hearing under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of 
this section, an ICI may respond in writing to EPA's charges in the 
notice of intent to suspend or revoke. An ICI's written response must be 
received by EPA within 30 days of the date of EPA's notice of intent. No 
final decision to suspend or revoke will be made before that time.

This list will be available to the public and may be obtained by writing 
to the following address: Chief, Selective Enforcement Auditing Section, 
Manufacturers Operations Division (6405-J), Environmental Protection 
Agency, 401 M Street SW, Washington, DC 20460.
    (c) Upon written request, EPA will make written determinations as to 
whether certain engines are or are not nonroad engines. Engines that are 
determined not to be nonroad engines are excluded from regulations under 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 89.904  Who may request an exemption.

    (a) Any person may request a testing exemption under Sec. 89.905.
    (b) Any nonroad engine manufacturer may request a national security 
exemption under Sec. 89.908.
    (c) For nonroad engine manufacturers, nonroad engines manufactured 
for export purposes are exempt without application, subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 89.909.
    (d) For eligible manufacturers, as determined by Sec. 89.906, 
manufacturer-owned nonroad engines are exempt without application, 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 89.906.

[[Page 133]]

    (e) For any person, display nonroad engines are exempt without 
application, subject to the provisions of Sec. 89.907.


<R05>
Sec. 89.905  Testing exemption.

    (a) Any person requesting a testing exemption must demonstrate the 
following:
    (1) That the proposed test program has a purpose which constitutes 
an appropriate basis for an exemption in accordance with this section;
    (2) That the proposed test program necessitates the granting of an 
exemption;
    (3) That the proposed test program exhibits reasonableness in scope; 
and
    (4) That the proposed test program exhibits a degree of control 
consonant with the purpose of the test program and EPA's monitoring 
requirements.
    (5) Paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section describe what 
constitutes a sufficient demonstration for each of the four identified 
elements.
    (b) With respect to the purpose of the proposed test program, an 
appropriate purpose would be research, investigations, studies, 
demonstrations, or training, but not national security. A concise 
statement of purpose is a required item of information.
    (c) With respect to the necessity that an exemption be granted, 
necessity arises from an inability to achieve the stated purpose in a 
practicable manner without performing or causing to be performed one or 
more of the prohibited acts under Sec. 89.1003. In appropriate 
circumstances, time constraints may be a sufficient basis for necessity, 
but the cost of certification alone, in the absence of extraordinary 
circumstances, is not a basis for necessity.
    (d) With respect to reasonableness, a test program must exhibit a 
duration of reasonable length and affect a reasonable number of engines. 
In this regard, required items of information include:
    (1) An estimate of the program's duration, and
    (2) The maximum number of nonroad engines involved.
    (e) With respect to control, the test program must incorporate 
procedures consistent with the purpose of the test and be capable of 
affording EPA monitoring capability. As a minimum, required items of 
information include:
    (1) The technical nature of the test;
    (2) The site of the test;
    (3) The time or mileage duration of the test;
    (4) The ownership arrangement with regard to the engines involved in 
the test;
    (5) The intended final disposition of the engines;
    (6) The manner in which the engine identification numbers will be 
identified, recorded, and made available; and
    (7) The means or procedure whereby test results will be recorded.
    (f) A manufacturer of new nonroad engines may request a testing 
exemption to cover nonroad engines intended for use in test programs 
planned or anticipated over the course of a subsequent one-year period. 
Unless otherwise required by the Director, Manufacturers Operations 
Division, a manufacturer requesting such an exemption need only furnish 
the information required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (d)(2) of this section 
along with a description of the record-keeping and control procedures 
that will be employed to assure that the engines are used for purposes 
consistent with paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 89.906  Manufacturer-owned exemption and precertification exemption.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any 
manufacturer-owned nonroad engine, as defined by Sec. 89.902, is exempt 
from Sec. 89.1003, without application, if the manufacturer complies 
with the following terms and conditions:
    (1) The manufacturer must establish, maintain, and retain the 
following adequately organized and indexed information on each exempted 
engine:
    (i) Engine identification number,
    (ii) Use of the engine on exempt status and
    (iii) Final disposition of any engine removed from exempt status; 
and
    (2) The manufacturer must provide right of entry and access to these 
records to EPA authorized representatives as outlined in Sec. 89.506-96.

[[Page 134]]

    (3) Unless the requirement is waived or an alternate procedure is 
approved by the Director, Manufacturers Operations Division, the 
manufacturer must permanently affix a label to each nonroad engine on 
exempt status. This label should
    (i) Be affixed in a readily visible portion of the engine,
    (ii) Be attached in such a manner that cannot be removed without 
destruction or defacement,
    (iii) State in the English language and in block letters and 
numerals of a color that contrasts with the background of the label, the 
following information:
    (A) The label heading ``Emission Control Information;''
    (B) Full corporate name and trademark of manufacturer;
    (C) Engine displacement, engine family identification, and model 
year of engine; or person of office to be contacted for further 
information about the engine;
    (D) The statement ``This nonroad engine is exempt from the 
prohibitions of 40 CFR section 90.1003.''
    (4) No provision of paragraph (a)(3) of this section prevents a 
manufacturer from including any other information it desires on the 
label.
    (b) Any independent commercial importer that desires a 
precertification exemption pursuant to Sec. 89.611(b)(3) and is in the 
business of importing, modifying, or testing uncertified nonroad engines 
for resale under the provisions of Sec. 89.611 et seq., must apply to 
the Director, Manufacturers Operations Division. The Director may 
require such independent commercial importer to submit information 
regarding the general nature of the fleet activities, the number of 
nonroad engines involved, and a demonstration that adequate record-
keeping procedures for control purposes will be employed.


<R05>
Sec. 89.907  Display exemption.

    Where an uncertified nonroad engine is a display engine to be used 
solely for display purposes, will only be operated incident and 
necessary to the display purpose, and will not be sold unless an 
applicable certificate of conformity has been received or the engine has 
been finally admitted pursuant to subpart G of this part, no request for 
exemption of the engine is necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 89.908  National security exemption.

    A manufacturer requesting a national security exemption must state 
the purpose for which the exemption is required and the request must be 
endorsed by an agency of the federal government charged with 
responsibility for national defense.


<R05>
Sec. 89.909  Export exemptions.

    (a) A new nonroad engine intended solely for export, and so labeled 
or tagged on the outside of the container and on the engine itself, is 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 89.1003, unless the importing country 
has new nonroad engine emission standards which differ from EPA 
standards.
    (b) For the purpose of paragraph (a) of this section, a country 
having no standards, whatsoever, is deemed to be a country having 
emission standards which differ from EPA standards.
    (c) EPA will maintain a list of foreign countries that have in force 
nonroad emission standards identical to EPA standards and have so 
notified EPA. This list may be obtained by writing to the following 
address: Chief, Selective Enforcement Auditing Section, Manufacturers 
Operations Division (6405-J), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M 
Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. New nonroad engines exported to such 
countries must comply with EPA certification regulations.
    (d) It is a condition of any exemption for the purpose of export 
under paragraph (a) of this section, that such exemption is void ab 
initio with respect to a new nonroad engine intended solely for export, 
where such nonroad engine is sold, or offered for sale, to an ultimate 
purchaser or otherwise distributed or introduced into commerce in the 
United States for purposes other than export.


<R05>
Sec. 89.910  Granting of exemptions.

    (a) If upon completion of the review of an exemption request made 
pursuant to Sec. 89.905 or Sec. 89.908, EPA determines it is appropriate 
to grant such an exemption, a memorandum of exemption is to be prepared 
and submitted to the person requesting the exemption. The

[[Page 135]]

memorandum is to set forth the basis for the exemption, its scope, and 
such terms and conditions as are deemed necessary. Such terms and 
conditions generally include, but are not limited to, agreements by the 
applicant to conduct the exempt activity in the manner described to EPA, 
create and maintain adequate records accessible to EPA at reasonable 
times, employ labels for the exempt engines setting forth the nature of 
the exemption, take appropriate measures to assure that the terms of the 
exemption are met, and advise EPA of the termination of the activity and 
the ultimate disposition of the engines.
    (b) Any exemption granted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
is deemed to cover any subject engine only to the extent that the 
specified terms and conditions are complied with. A breach of any term 
or condition causes the exemption to be void ab initio with respect to 
any engine. Consequently, the causing or the performing of an act 
prohibited under Sec. 89.1003( a)(1) or (a)(3), other than in strict 
conformity with all terms and conditions of this exemption, renders the 
person to whom the exemption is granted, and any other person to whom 
the provisions of Sec. 89.1003(a) are applicable, liable to suit under 
sections 204 and 205 of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 89.911  Submission of exemption requests.

    Requests for exemption or further information concerning exemptions 
and/or the exemption request review procedure should be addressed to: 
Chief, Selective Enforcement Auditing Section, Manufacturers Operations 
Division (6405-J), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW, 
Washington, DC 20460.

<R05>
Sec. 89.1004  General enforcement provisions.

    (a) Information collection provisions. (1) Every manufacturer of new 
nonroad engines and other persons subject to the requirements of this 
part must establish and maintain records, perform tests where such 
testing is not otherwise reasonably available under this part, make 
reports and provide information the Administrator may reasonably require 
to determine whether the manufacturer or other person has acted or is 
acting in compliance with this part or to otherwise carry out the 
provisions of this part, and must, upon request of an officer or 
employee duly designated by the Administrator, permit the officer or 
employee at reasonable times to have access to and copy such records. 
The manufacturer shall comply in all respects with the requirements of 
subpart I of this part.
    (2) For purposes of enforcement of this part, an officer or employee 
duly designated by the Administrator, upon presenting appropriate 
credentials, is authorized:
    (i) To enter, at reasonable times, any establishment of the 
manufacturer, or of any person whom the manufacturer engaged to perform 
any activity required under paragraph (a) (1) of this section, for the 
purposes of inspecting or observing any activity conducted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and
    (ii) To inspect records, files, papers, processes, controls, and 
facilities used in performing an activity required by paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section, by the manufacturer or by a person whom the 
manufacturer engaged to perform the activity.
    (b) Exemption provision. The Administrator may exempt a new nonroad 
engine from Sec. 89.1003 upon such terms and conditions as the 
Administrator may find necessary for the purpose of export, research, 
investigations, studies, demonstrations, or training, or for reasons of 
national security.
    (c) Importation provision. (1) A new nonroad engine, vehicle, or 
equipment offered for importation or imported by a person in violation 
of Sec. 89.1003 is to be refused admission into the United States, but 
the Secretary of the Treasury and the Administrator may, by joint 
regulation, provide for deferring a final determination as to admission 
and authorizing the delivery of such a nonroad engine offered for import 
to the owner or consignee thereof upon such terms and conditions 
(including the furnishing of a bond) as may appear to them appropriate 
to insure that the nonroad engine will be brought into conformity with 
the standards, requirements, and limitations applicable to it under this 
part.
    (2) If a nonroad engine is finally refused admission under this 
paragraph, the Secretary of the Treasury shall cause disposition thereof 
in accordance with the customs laws unless it is exported, under 
regulations prescribed by the Secretary, within 90 days of the date of 
notice of the refusal or additional time as may be permitted pursuant to 
the regulations.
    (3) Disposition in accordance with the customs laws may not be made 
in such manner as may result, directly or indirectly, in the sale, to 
the ultimate consumer, of a new nonroad engine that fails to comply with 
applicable standards of the Administrator under this part.
    (d) Export provision. A new nonroad engine intended solely for 
export, and so labeled or tagged on the outside of the container and on 
the engine itself, shall be subject to the provisions of Sec. 89.1003, 
except that if the country that is to receive the engine has emission 
standards that differ from the standards prescribed under subpart B of 
this part, then the engine must comply with the standards of the country 
that is to receive the engine.

<R05>
Sec. 89.1006  Penalties.

    (a) Violations. A violation of the requirements of this subpart is a 
violation of the applicable provisions of the Act, including sections 
213(d) and 203, and is subject to the penalty provisions thereunder.
    (1) A person who violates Sec. 89.1003(a)(1), (a)(4), or (a)(6), or 
a manufacturer or dealer who violates Sec. 89.1003(a)(3)(i), is subject 
to a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 for each violation.
    (2) A person other than a manufacturer or dealer who violates 
Sec. 89.1003(a)(3)(i) or any person who violates Sec. 89.1003(a)(3)(ii) 
is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $2,500 for each 
violation.
    (3) A violation with respect to Sec. 89.1003 (a)(1), (a)(3)(i), 
(a)(4), or (a)(6) constitutes a separate offense with respect to each 
nonroad engine.
    (4) A violation with respect to Sec. 89.1003(a)(3)(ii) constitutes a 
separate offense with respect to each part or component. Each day of a 
violation with respect to Sec. 89.1003(a)(5) constitutes a separate 
offense.
    (5) A person who violates Sec. 89.1003(a)(2) or (a)(5) is subject to 
a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 per day of violation.
    (b) Civil actions. The Administrator may commence a civil action to 
assess and recover any civil penalty under paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (1) An action under this paragraph may be brought in the district 
court of the United States for the district in which the defendant 
resides or has the Administrator's principal place of business, and the 
court has jurisdiction to assess a civil penalty.
    (2) In determining the amount of a civil penalty to be assessed 
under this paragraph, the court is to take into account the gravity of 
the violation, the economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from 
the violation, the size of the violator's business, the violator's 
history of compliance with Title II of the Act, action taken to remedy 
the violation, the effect of the penalty on the violator's ability to 
continue in business, and such other matters as justice may require.
    (3) In any such action, subpoenas for witnesses who are required to 
attend a district court in any district may run into any other district.
    (c) Administrative assessment of certain penalties--(1) 
Administrative penalty authority. In lieu of commencing a civil action 
under paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator may assess any 
civil penalty prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, except that 
the maximum amount of penalty sought against each violator in a penalty 
assessment proceeding shall not exceed $200,000, unless the 
Administrator and the Attorney General jointly determine that a matter 
involving a larger penalty amount is appropriate for administrative 
penalty assessment. Any such determination by the Administrator and the 
Attorney General is not subject to judicial review. Assessment of a 
civil penalty shall be by an order made on the record after opportunity 
for a hearing held in accordance with the procedures found at part 22 of 
this chapter. The Administrator may compromise, or remit, with or 
without conditions, any administrative penalty which may be imposed 
under this section.
    (2) Determining amount. In determining the amount of any civil 
penalty assessed under this paragraph, the Administrator shall take into 
account the gravity of the violation, the economic benefit or savings 
(if any) resulting from the violation, the size of the violator's 
business, the violator's history of compliance with Title II of the Act, 
action taken to remedy the violation, the effect of the penalty on the 
violator's ability to continue in business, and such other matters as 
justice may require.
    (3) Effect of administrator's action.
    (i) Action by the Administrator under this paragraph does not affect 
or limit the Administrator's authority to enforce any provisions of the 
Act; except that any violation with respect to which the Administrator 
has commenced and is diligently prosecuting an action under this 
paragraph, or for which the Administrator has issued a final order not 
subject to further judicial review and for which the violator has paid a 
penalty assessment under this paragraph shall not be the subject of a 
civil penalty action under paragraph (b) of this section.

[[Page 139]]

    (ii) No action by the Administrator under this paragraph shall 
affect a person's obligation to comply with a section of this part.
    (4) Finality of order. An order issued under this subsection is to 
become final 30 days after its issuance unless a petition for judicial 
review is filed under paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
    (5) Judicial review. A person against whom a civil penalty is 
assessed in accordance with this subsection may seek review of the 
assessment in the United States District Court for the District of 
Columbia or for the district in which the violation is alleged to have 
occurred, in which such person resides, or where the person's principal 
place of business is located, within the 30-day period beginning on the 
date a civil penalty order is issued. The person shall simultaneously 
send a copy of the filing by certified mail to the Administrator and the 
Attorney General. The Administrator shall file in the court within 30 
days a certified copy, or certified index, as appropriate, of the record 
on which the order was issued. The court is not to set aside or remand 
any order issued in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph 
unless substantial evidence does not exist in the record, taken as a 
whole, to support the finding of a violation or unless the 
Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of 
discretion, and the court is not to impose additional civil penalties 
unless the Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an 
abuse of discretion. In any proceedings, the United States may seek to 
recover civil penalties assessed under this section.
    (6) Collection. (i) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a 
civil penalty imposed by the Administrator as provided in this part 
after the order making the assessment has become final or after a court 
in an action brought under paragraph (c)(5) of this section has entered 
a final judgment in favor of the Administrator, the Administrator shall 
request that the Attorney General bring a civil action in an appropriate 
district court to recover the amount assessed (plus interest at rates 
established pursuant to section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986 from the date of the final order or the date of final judgment, 
as the case may be). In such an action, the validity, amount, and 
appropriateness of the penalty is not subject to review.
    (ii) A person who fails to pay on a timely basis the amount of an 
assessment of a civil penalty as described in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of 
this section shall be required to pay, in addition to that amount and 
interest, the United States' enforcement expenses, including attorney's 
fees and costs for collection proceedings, and a quarterly nonpayment 
penalty for each quarter during which the failure to pay persists. The 
nonpayment penalty is an amount equal to ten percent of the aggregate 
amount of that person's penalties and nonpayment penalties which are 
unpaid as of the beginning of such quarter.


<R05>
Sec. 89.1007  Warranty provisions.

    (a) The manufacturer of each nonroad engine must warrant to the 
ultimate purchaser and each subsequent purchaser that the engine is 
designed, built, and equipped so as to conform at the time of sale with 
applicable regulations under section 213 of the Act, and is free from 
defects in materials and workmanship which cause such engine to fail to 
conform with applicable regulations for its warranty period (as 
determined under Sec. 89.104-96).
    (b) In the case of a nonroad engine part, the manufacturer or 
rebuilder of the part may certify according to Sec. 85.2112 that use of 
the part will not result in a failure of the engine to comply with 
emission standards promulgated in this part.
    (c) For the purposes of this section, the owner of any nonroad 
engine warranted under this part is responsible for the proper 
maintenance of the engine. Proper maintenance includes replacement and 
service, at the owner's expense at a service establishment or facility 
of the owner's choosing, such items as spark plugs, points, condensers, 
and any other part, item, or device related to emission control (but not 
designed for emission control) under the terms of the last sentence of 
section 207(a)(3) of the Act, unless such part, item, or device is

Sec. 89.1008  In-use compliance provisions.

    (a) Effective with respect to nonroad vehicles, equipment, and 
engines manufactured during model years 1996 and after:
    (1) If the Administrator determines that a substantial number of any 
class or category of engines, although properly maintained and used, do 
not conform to the regulations prescribed under section 213 of the Act 
when in actual use throughout their recall period (as defined under 
Sec. 89.104-96(b)), the Administrator shall immediately notify the 
manufacturer of such nonconformity and require the manufacturer to 
submit a plan for remedying the nonconformity of the engines with 
respect to which such notification is given.
    (i) The manufacturer's plan shall provide that the nonconformity of 
any such engines which are properly used and maintained will be remedied 
at the expense of the manufacturer.
    (ii) If the manufacturer disagrees with such determination of 
nonconformity and so advises the Administrator, the Administrator shall 
afford the manufacturer and other interested persons an opportunity to 
present their views and evidence in support thereof at a public hearing. 
Unless, as a result of such hearing, the Administrator withdraws such 
determination of nonconformity, the Administrator shall, within 60 days 
after the completion of such hearing, order the manufacturer to provide 
prompt notification of such nonconformity in accordance with paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section. The manufacturer shall comply in all respects 
with the requirements of subpart G of this part.
    (2) Any notification required to be given by the manufacturer under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to any class or category 
of engines shall be given to dealers, ultimate purchasers, and 
subsequent purchasers (if known) in such manner and containing such 
information as required in subparts H and I of this part.
    (3)(i) The manufacturer shall furnish with each new nonroad engine 
written instructions for the proper maintenance and use of the engine by 
the ultimate purchaser as required under Sec. 89.109-96. The 
manufacturer shall provide in boldface type on the first page of the 
written maintenance instructions notice that maintenance, replacement, 
or repair of the emission control devices and systems may be performed 
by any nonroad engine repair establishment or individual using any 
nonroad engine part which has been certified as provided in 
Sec. 89.1007(a).
    (ii) The instruction under paragraph (3)(i) of this section must not 
include any condition on the ultimate purchaser's using, in connection 
with such engine, any component or service (other than a component or 
service provided without charge under the terms of the purchase 
agreement) which is identified by brand, trade, or corporate name. 
Subject instructions also must not directly or indirectly distinguish 
between service performed by the franchised dealers of such 
manufacturer, or any other service establishments with which such 
manufacturer has a commercial relationship, and service performed by 
independent nonroad engine repair facilities with which such 
manufacturer has no commercial relationship.
    (iii) The prohibition of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section may be 
waived by the Administrator if:
    (A) The manufacturer satisfies the Administrator that the engine 
will function properly only if the component or service so identified is 
used in connection with such engine, and
    (B) The Administrator finds that such a waiver is in the public 
interest.
    (iv) In addition, the manufacturer shall indicate by means of a 
label or tag permanently affixed to the engine that the engine is 
covered by a certificate of conformity issued for the purpose of 
assuring achievement of emission standards prescribed under section 213 
of the Act. This label or tag shall also contain information relating to 
control of emissions as prescribed under Sec. 89.110-96.
    (b) The manufacturer bears all cost obligation a dealer incurs as a 
result of a requirement imposed by paragraph (a) of this section. The 
transfer of any such cost obligation from a manufacturer to a dealer 
through franchise or other agreement is prohibited.
    (c) If a manufacturer includes in an advertisement a statement 
respecting the cost or value of emission control

[[Page 141]]

devices or systems, the manufacturer shall set forth in the statement 
the cost or value attributed to these devices or systems by the 
Secretary of Labor (through the Bureau of Labor Statistics). The 
Secretary of Labor, and his or her representatives, has the same access 
for this purpose to the books, documents, papers, and records of a 
manufacturer as the Comptroller General has to those of a recipient of 
assistance for purposes of section 311 of the Act.
    (d) Any inspection of a nonroad engine for purposes of paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, after its sale to the ultimate purchaser, is to 
be made only if the owner of such vehicle or engine voluntarily permits 
such inspection to be made, except as may be provided by any state or 
local inspection program.

which is physically capable of being adjusted (including those which are 
difficult to access) and which, if adjusted, may affect emissions or 
engine performance during emission testing or normal in-use operation.
    Administrator means the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency or his or her authorized representative.
    Auxiliary emission control device (AECD) means any element of design 
that senses temperature, vehicle speed, engine RPM, transmission gear, 
or any other parameter for the purpose of activating, modulating, 
delaying, or deactivating the operation of any part of the emission 
control system.
    Certification means, with respect to new nonroad engines, obtaining 
a certificate of conformity for an engine family complying with the 
nonroad engine emission standards and requirements specified in this 
part.
    Emission control system means any device, system, or element of 
design which controls or reduces the emission of substances from an 
engine.
    Engine as used in this part, refers to nonroad engine.
    Engine family means a group of engines, as specified in Sec. 90.116.
    Engine manufacturer means any person engaged in the manufacturing or 
assembling of new nonroad engines or the importing of such engines for 
resale, or who acts for and is under the

[[Page 144]]

control of any such person in connection with the distribution of such 
engines. Engine manufacturer does not include any dealer with respect to 
new nonroad engines received by such person in commerce.
    EPA enforcement officer means any officer, employee, or authorized 
representative of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency so designated 
in writing by the Administrator (or by his or her designee).
    Exhaust emissions means matter emitted into the atmosphere from any 
opening downstream from the exhaust port of a nonroad engine.
    Fuel system means all components involved in the transport, 
metering, and mixture of the fuel from the fuel tank to the combustion 
chamber(s) including the following: fuel tank, fuel tank cap, fuel pump, 
fuel lines, oil injection metering system, carburetor or fuel injection 
components, and all fuel system vents.
    Gross power means the power measured at the crankshaft or its 
equivalent, the engine being equipped only with the standard accessories 
(such as oil pumps, coolant pumps, and so forth) necessary for its 
operation on the test bed.
    Handheld equipment engine means a nonroad engine that meets the 
requirements specified in Sec. 90.103(a)(2) (i) through (iv).
    Model year (MY) means the manufacturer's annual new model production 
period which includes January 1 of the calendar year, ends no later than 
December 31 of the calendar year, and does not begin earlier than 
January 2 of the previous calendar year. Where a manufacturer has no 
annual new model production period, model year means calendar year.
    New, for the purposes of this part, means a nonroad engine or 
nonroad vehicle the equitable or legal title to which has never been 
transferred to an ultimate purchaser. Where the equitable or legal title 
to the engine or vehicle is not transferred to an ultimate purchaser 
until after the engine or vehicle is placed into service, then the 
engine or vehicle will no longer be new after it is placed into service. 
A nonroad engine or vehicle is placed into service when it is used for 
its functional purposes. With respect to imported nonroad engines or 
nonroad vehicles, the term ``new'' means an engine or vehicle that is 
not covered by a certificate of conformity issued under this part at the 
time of importation, and that is manufactured after the effective date 
of a regulation issued under this part which is applicable to such 
engine or vehicle (or which would be applicable to such engine or 
vehicle had it been manufactured for importation into the United 
States).
    Nonroad engine means:
    (1) Except as discussed in paragraph (2) of this definition, any 
internal combustion engine:
    (i) In or on a piece of equipment that is self-propelled or serves a 
dual purpose by both propelling itself and performing another function 
(such as garden tractors, off-highway mobile cranes, and bulldozers); or
    (ii) In or on a piece of equipment that is intended to be propelled 
while performing its function (such as lawnmowers and string trimmers); 
or
    (iii) That, by itself or in or on a piece of equipment, is portable 
or transportable, meaning designed to be and capable of being carried or 
moved from one location to another. Indicia of transportability include, 
but are not limited to, wheels, skids, carrying handles, dolly, trailer, 
or platform.
    (2) An internal combustion engine is not a nonroad engine if:
    (i) The engine is used to propel a motor vehicle or a vehicle used 
solely for competition, or is subject to standards promulgated under 
section 202 of the Act; or
    (ii) The engine is regulated by a federal New Source Performance 
Standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act; or
    (iii) The engine otherwise included in paragraph (1)(iii) of this 
definition remains or will remain at a location for more than 12 
consecutive months or a shorter period of time for an engine located at 
a seasonal source. A location is any site at a building, structure, 
facility, or installation. Any engine (or engines) that replaces an 
engine at a location and that is intended to perform the same or similar 
function as the engine replaced will be included in

[[Page 145]]

calculating the consecutive time period. An engine located at a seasonal 
source is an engine that remains at a seasonal source during the full 
annual operating period of the seasonal source. A seasonal source is a 
stationary source that remains in a single location on a permanent basis 
(i.e., at least two years) and that operates at that single location 
approximately three months (or more) each year. This paragraph does not 
apply to an engine after the engine is removed from the location.
    Nonroad vehicle means a vehicle that is powered by a nonroad engine 
as defined in this section and that is not a motor vehicle or a vehicle 
used solely for competition. Nonroad vehicle also includes equipment 
that is powered by nonroad engines.
    Nonroad vehicle manufacturer means any person engaged in the 
manufacturing or assembling of new nonroad vehicles or importing such 
vehicles for resale, or who acts for and is under the control of any 
such person in connection with the distribution of such vehicles. A 
nonroad vehicle manufacturer does not include any dealer with respect to 
new nonroad vehicles received by such person in commerce.
    Operating hours means:
    (1) For engine storage areas or facilities, all times during which 
personnel other than custodial personnel are at work in the vicinity of 
the storage area or facility and have access to it.
    (2) For all other areas or facilities, all times during which an 
assembly line is in operation or all times during which testing, 
maintenance, service accumulation, production or compilation of records, 
or any other procedure or activity related to certification testing, to 
translation of designs from the test stage to the production stage, or 
to engine manufacture or assembly is being carried out in a facility.
    Presentation of credentials means the display of the document 
designating a person as an EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized 
representative.
    Scheduled maintenance means any adjustment, repair, removal, 
disassembly, cleaning, or replacement of components or systems required 
by the manufacturer to be performed on a periodic basis to prevent part 
failure or vehicle or engine malfunction, or those actions anticipated 
as necessary to correct an overt indication of malfunction or failure 
for which periodic maintenance is not appropriate.
    Test engine means the engine or group of engines that a manufacturer 
uses during certification to determine compliance with emission 
standards.
    Ultimate purchaser means, with respect to any new nonroad engine or 
new nonroad vehicle, the first person who in good faith purchases such 
new nonroad engine or vehicle for purposes other than resale.
    Used solely for competition means exhibiting features that are not 
easily removed and that would render its use other than in competition 
unsafe, impractical, or highly unlikely.
    Warranty period means the period of time the engine or part is 
covered by the warranty provisions.

emission

[[Page 148]]

standards. Boundaries for each class are indicated in Sec. 90.116(b).
    (2) Emission standards for classes III, IV, V may be used only if an 
engine meets at least one of the following requirements:
    (i) The engine must be used in a piece of equipment that is carried 
by the operator throughout the performance of its intended function(s);
    (ii) The engine must be used in a piece of equipment that must 
operate multipositionally, such as upside down or sideways, to complete 
its intended function(s);
    (iii) The engine must be used in a piece of equipment for which the 
combined engine and equipment dry weight is under 14 kilograms, no more 
than two wheels are present on the equipment, and at least one of the 
following attributes is also present:
    (A) The operator must alternately provide support or carry the 
equipment throughout the performance of its intended function(s);
    (B) The operator must provide support or attitudinal control for the 
equipment throughout the performance of its intended function(s); and

engines used to power snowthrowers may meet class III, IV, or V 
standards.
    (5) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section, engines used 
exclusively to power snowthrowers or ice augers, at the option of the 
engine manufacturer, need not certify to or comply with standards 
regulating emissions of hydrocarbons. If the manufacturer exercises the 
option to certify to standards regulating such emissions, such engines 
must meet such standards. If the engine produced by the manufacturer is 
to be used in any equipment or vehicle other than a snowthrower or ice 
auger, it must be certified to the applicable standard regulating 
emissions of hydrocarbons.
    (b) Exhaust emissions will be measured using the procedures set 
forth in subpart E of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 90.104  Compliance with emission standards.

    (a) If all test engines representing an engine family have emissions 
less than or equal to each emission standard in a given engine 
displacement class, that family complies with that class of emission 
standards.
    (b) If any test engine representing an engine family has emissions 
greater than any one emission standard in a given engine displacement 
class, that family will be deemed not in compliance with that class of 
emission standards.
    (c) If catalysts are used in an engine family, the engine 
manufacturer must affirm that catalyst durability has been confirmed on 
the basis of the evaluation procedure that is specified in subpart E of 
this part.

    (a) Except as specified in Sec. 90.2(b), every manufacturer of new 
engines produced during or after model year 1997 must obtain a 
certificate of conformity covering such engines; however, engines 
manufactured during an annual production period beginning prior to 
September 1, 1996 are not required to be certified.
    (b)(1) The annual production period begins either when an engine 
family is first produced or on January 2 of the calendar year preceding 
the year for which the model year is designated, whichever date is 
later. The annual production period ends either when the last engine is 
produced or on December 31 of the calendar year for which the model year 
is named, whichever date is sooner.

[[Page 149]]

    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, annual 
production periods beginning prior to September 1, 1996 may not exceed 
12 months in length.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, a 
certificate of conformity is deemed to cover the engines named in such 
certificate and produced during the annual production period, as defined 
in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the 
certificate of conformity must be obtained from the Administrator prior 
to selling, offering for sale, introducing into commerce, or importing 
into the United States the new engine. Engines produced prior to the 
effective date of a certificate of conformity may also be covered by the 
certificate, once it is effective, if the following conditions are met:
    (1) The engines conform in all respects to the engines described in 
the application for the certificate of conformity.
    (2) The engines are not sold, offered for sale, introduced into 
commerce, or delivered for introduction into commerce prior to the 
effective date of the certificate of conformity.
    (3) EPA is notified prior to the beginning of production when such 
production will start, and EPA is provided a full opportunity to inspect 
and/or test the engines during and after their production. EPA must have 
the opportunity to conduct SEA production line testing as if the 
vehicles had been produced after the effective date of the certificate.
    (e) Engines that are certified by EPA prior to January 2, 1996 for 
model year 1997 may be delivered for introduction into commerce prior to 
January 2, 1996 once a certificate of conformity has been issued.
    (f) Engines imported by an original equipment manufacturer after 
December 31 of the calendar year for which the model year is named are 
still covered by the certificate of conformity as long as the production 
of the engine was completed before December 31 of that year.


<R05>

    (a) At the time of certification the engine manufacturer may propose 
which engine families should be included in an in-use test program. EPA 
will approve a manufacturer's test program if the selected engine 
families represent an adequate consideration of the elements listed in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Number of engines to be tested. The number of engines to be 
tested by a manufacturer is determined by the following method:
    (1) For an engine manufacturer with total projected annual 
production of more than 75,000 engines destined for the United States 
market for that model year, the minimum number of engines to be tested 
may be the lowest of the numbers determined in paragraph (b)(1)(i), (ii) 
or (iii) of this section:
    (i) Divide the manufacturer's total projected annual production of 
small SI engines destined for the United States market for that model 
year by 50,000, and round to the nearest whole number;

[[Page 152]]

    (ii) Test five engines each from 25 percent of all engine families 
certified in that model year; and
    (iii) Test three engines each from 50 percent of all engine families 
certified in that model year.
    (2) An engine manufacturer with total projected annual production of 
75,000 engines or less destined for the United States market for that 
model year may test a minimum of two engines.
    (c) Criteria for selecting test engines. An engine manufacturer may 
select test engines from engine families utilizing the following 
criteria and in the order specified:
    (1) Engine families using emission control technology which most 
likely will be used on Phase 2 engines;
    (2) Engine families using aftertreatment;
    (3) Engine families certified to different emission standards;
    (4) Different engine designs (such as sidevalve head versus overhead 
valve engines);
    (5) Engine families using emission control technology specifically 
installed to achieve compliance with emission standards of this part;
    (6) The engine family with the highest projected annual sales; and
    (7) Engine families which meet the above criteria, but have not been 
included in prior model year in-use testing programs as required by 
these provisions.
    (d) Collection of in-use engines. An engine manufacturer may procure 
in-use engines which have been operated for between half and three-
quarters of the engine's advertised (or projected) useful life. All 
testing may be completed within three years from the date the 
certificate is first issued for an engine family undergoing in-use 
testing.
    (1) Test engines may be procured from sources not associated with 
the engine manufacturer or vehicle manufacturer, except that with prior 
approval of the Administrator, an engine manufacturer with annual sales 
of less than 50,000 engines may obtain in-use engines associated with 
itself or its vehicle manufacturer.
    (2) A test engine should have a maintenance history representative 
of actual in-use conditions.
    (i) A manufacturer may question the end user regarding the 
accumulated usage, maintenance, operating conditions, and storage of the 
test engines.
    (ii) Documents used in the procurement process may be maintained as 
required in Sec. 90.121.
    (3) Maintenance and testing of test engines.
    (i) The manufacturer may perform minimal set-to-spec maintenance on 
a test engine. Maintenance may include only that which is listed in the 
owner's instructions for engines with the amount of service and age of 
the acquired test engine.
    (ii) Documentation of all maintenance and adjustments may be 
maintained and retained as required by Sec. 90.121.
    (4) One valid emission test may be conducted for each in-use engine.
    (5) If a selected in-use engine fails to comply with any applicable 
certification emission standard, the manufacturer may determine the 
reason for noncompliance. The manufacturer may report all determinations 
for noncompliance in its annual in-use test result report as described 
below.
    (e) In-use test program reporting. The manufacturer may submit to 
the Administrator by January 30 of each calendar year all emission 
testing results generated from in-use testing. The following information 
may be reported for each test engine:
    (1) Engine family;
    (2) Model;
    (3) Engine serial number;
    (4) Date of manufacture;
    (5) Estimated hours of use;
    (6) Results of all emission testing;
    (7) Summary of all maintenance and/or adjustments performed;
    (8) Summary of all modifications and/or repairs; and
    (9) Determinations of compliance and/or noncompliance.
    (f) The Administrator may approve and/or suggest modifications to a 
manufacturer's in-use testing program.

    (10) Other information concerning proper maintenance and use or 
indicating compliance or noncompliance with other standards may be 
indicated on the label.
    (d) If there is insufficient space on the engine (or on the vehicle 
where a supplemental label is required under paragraph (b) of this 
section) to accommodate a label including all the information required 
in paragraph (c) of this section, the manufacturer may delete or alter 
the label as indicated in this paragraph. The information deleted from 
the label must appear in the owner's manual.
    (1) Exclude the information required in paragraphs (c)(3), (4), and 
(5) of this section. The fuel or lubricant may be specified elsewhere on 
the engine.
    (2) Exclude the information required by paragraph (c)(6) of this 
section, if the date the engine was manufactured is stamped on the 
engine.
    (e) The Administrator may, upon request, waive or modify the label 
content requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, provided 
that the intent of such requirements is met.


<R05>
Sec. 90.115  Requirement of certification--supplying production engines upon request.

    Upon the Administrator's request, the manufacturer must supply a 
reasonable number of production engines for testing and evaluation. 
These engines must be representative of typical production and supplied 
for testing at such time and place and for such reasonable periods as 
the Administrator may require.


<R05>
Sec. 90.116  Certification procedure--determining engine displacement, engine class, and engine families.

    (a) Engine displacement must be calculated using nominal engine 
values and rounded to the nearest whole cubic centimeter in accordance 
with ASTM E29-93a. This procedure has been incorporated by reference. 
See Sec. 90.7.
    (b) Engines will be divided into classes by the following:
    (1) Class I--engines less than 225 cc in displacement,

[[Page 154]]

    (2) Class II--engines greater than or equal to 225 cc in 
displacement,
    (3) Class III--handheld equipment engines less than 20 cc in 
displacement,
    (4) Class IV--handheld equipment engines equal or greater than 20 cc 
but less than 50 cc in displacement, and
    (5) Class V--handheld equipment engines equal to or greater than 50 
cc in displacement.
    (c) The manufacturer's product line will be divided into groupings 
of engine families as specified by paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) To be classed in the same engine family, engines must be 
identical in all of the following applicable respects:
    (1) The combustion cycle;
    (2) The cooling mechanism;
    (3) The cylinder configuration (inline, vee, opposed, bore spacings, 
and so forth);
    (4) The number of cylinders;
    (5) The engine class;
    (6) The number of catalytic converters, location, volume, and 
composition; and
    (7) The thermal reactor characteristics.
    (e) At the manufacturer's option, engines identical in all the 
respects listed in paragraph (d) of this section may be further divided 
into different engine families if the Administrator determines that they 
may be expected to have different emission characteristics. This 
determination is based upon the consideration of features such as:
    (1) The bore and stroke;
    (2) The combustion chamber configuration;
    (3) The intake and exhaust timing method of actuation (poppet valve, 
reed valve, rotary valve, and so forth);
    (4) The intake and exhaust valve or port sizes, as applicable;
    (5) The fuel system;
    (6) The exhaust system; and
    (7) The method of air aspiration.
    (f) Where engines are of a type which cannot be divided into engine 
families based upon the criteria listed in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the Administrator will establish families for those engines 
based upon the features most related to their emission characteristics.


<R05>
Sec. 90.117  Certification procedure--test engine selection.

    (a) The manufacturer must select, from each engine family, a test 
engine that the manufacturer determines to be most likely to exceed the 
emission standard.
    (b) The test engine must be constructed to be representative of 
production engines.


<R05>
Sec. 90.118  Certification procedure--service accumulation.

    (a)(1) The test engine must be operated with all emission control 
systems operating properly for a period sufficient to stabilize 
emissions.
    (2) The period sufficient to stabilize emissions may not exceed 12 
hours.
    (b) No maintenance, other than recommended lubrication and filter 
changes, may be performed during service accumulation without the 
Administrator's approval.
    (c) Service accumulation is to be performed in a manner using good 
engineering judgment to ensure that emissions are representative of 
production engines.
    (d) The manufacturer must maintain, and provide to the Administrator 
if requested, records stating the rationale for selecting a service 
accumulation period less than 12 hours and records describing the method 
used to accumulate hours on the test engine(s).

[60 FR 34598, July 3, 1995, as amended at 61 FR 20742, May 8, 1996]

Sec. 90.118  Certification procedure--service accumulation.

                                * * * * *

    (d) The manufacturer must maintain, and provide to the 
Administrator, records stating the rationale for selecting a service 
accumulation period less than 12 hours and records describing the method 
used to accumulate hours on the test engine(s).


<R05>
Sec. 90.119  Certification procedure--testing.

    (a) Manufacturer testing. The manufacturer must test the test engine 
using the specified test procedures and appropriate test cycle. All test 
results must be reported to the Administrator.
    (1) The test procedure to be used is detailed in Subpart E of this 
part.

[[Page 155]]

    (i) Class I and II engines must use Test Cycle A described in 
Subpart E of this part, except that Class I and II engine families in 
which 100 percent of the engines sold operate only at rated speed may 
use Test Cycle B described in subpart E of this part.
    (ii) Class III, IV, and V engines must use Test Cycle C described in 
subpart E of this part.
    (2) Emission test equipment provisions are described in subpart D of 
this part.
    (b) Administrator testing. (1) The Administrator may require that 
any one or more of the test engines be submitted to the Administrator, 
at such place or places as the Administrator may designate, for the 
purposes of conducting emission tests. The Administrator may specify 
that testing will be conducted at the manufacturer's facility, in which 
case instrumentation and equipment specified by the Administrator must 
be made available by the manufacturer for test operations. Any testing 
conducted at a manufacturer's facility must be scheduled by the 
manufacturer as promptly as possible.
    (2)(i) Whenever the Administrator conducts a test on a test engine, 
the results of that test will, unless subsequently invalidated by the 
Administrator, comprise the official data for the engine and the 
manufacturer's data will not be used in determining compliance with 
emission standards.
    (ii) Prior to the performance of such test, the Administrator may 
adjust or cause to be adjusted any adjustable parameter of the test 
engine which the Administrator has determined to be subject to 
adjustment for certification testing, to any setting within the 
physically adjustable range of that parameter, to determine whether such 
engine conforms to applicable emission standards.
    (iii) For those engine parameters which the Administrator has not 
determined to be subject to adjustment for certification testing, the 
test engine presented to the Administrator for testing will be 
calibrated within the production tolerances applicable to the 
manufacturer specification shown on the engine label or in the owner's 
manual, as specified in the application for certification.
    (c) Use of carryover test data. In lieu of testing, the manufacturer 
may submit, with the Administrator's approval, emission test data used 
to certify substantially similar engine families in previous years. This 
``carryover'' test data is only allowable if the data shows the test 
engine would fully comply with the emission standards for the applicable 
class.
    (d) Scheduled maintenance during testing. No scheduled maintenance 
may be performed during testing of the engine.
    (e) Unscheduled maintenance on test engines.
    (1) Manufacturers may not perform any unscheduled engine, emission 
control system, or fuel system adjustment, repair, removal, disassembly, 
cleaning, or replacement on a test engine without the advance approval 
of the Administrator.
    (2) The Administrator may approve unscheduled maintenance if:
    (i) A preliminary determination has been made that a part failure or 
system malfunction, or the repair of such failure or malfunction, does 
not render the engine unrepresentative of engines in use, and does not 
require direct access to the combustion chamber; and
    (ii) A determination has been made that the need for maintenance or 
repairs is indicated by an overt malfunction such as persistent misfire, 
engine stall, overheating, fluid leakage, or loss of oil pressure.
    (3) Emission measurements may not be used as a means of determining 
the need for unscheduled maintenance under paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section.
    (4) The Administrator must have the opportunity to verify the extent 
of any overt indication of part failure (for example, misfire, stall), 
or an activation of an audible and/or visual signal, prior to the 
manufacturer performing any maintenance related to such overt indication 
or signal.
    (5) Unless approved by the Administrator prior to use, engine 
manufacturers may not use any equipment, instruments, or tools to 
identify malfunctioning, maladjusted, or defective engine components 
unless the same or equivalent equipment, instruments, or tools are 
available at dealerships and other service outlets and are used in

[[Page 156]]

conjunction with scheduled maintenance on such components.
    (6) If the Administrator determines that part failure or system 
malfunction occurrence and/or repair rendered the engine 
unrepresentative of production engines, the engine cannot be used as a 
test engine.
    (7) Unless waived by the Administrator, complete emission tests are 
required before and after any engine maintenance which may reasonably be 
expected to affect emissions.
    (f) Engine failure. A manufacturer may not use as a test engine any 
engine which incurs major mechanical failure necessitating disassembly 
of the engine. This prohibition does not apply to failures which occur 
after completion of the service accumulation period.


<R05>
Sec. 90.120  Certification procedure--use of special test procedures.

    (a) Use of special test procedures by EPA. The Administrator may 
establish special test procedures for any engine that the Administrator 
determines is not susceptible to satisfactory testing under the 
specified test procedures set forth in subpart E of this part.
    (b)(1) Use of alternate test procedures by an engine manufacturer. A 
manufacturer may elect to use an alternate test procedure provided that 
it yields results equal to the results from the specified test procedure 
in subpart E, its use is approved in advance by the Administrator, and 
the basis for equivalent results with the specified test procedure is 
fully described in the manufacturer's application.
    (2) An engine manufacturer electing to use alternate test procedures 
is solely responsible for the results obtained. The Administrator may 
reject data generated under test procedures which do not correlate with 
data generated under the specified procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 90.121  Certification procedure--recordkeeping.

    (a) The engine manufacturer must maintain the following adequately 
organized records:
    (1) Copies of all applications filed with the Administrator;
    (2) A copy of all data obtained through the in-use testing program; 
and
    (3) A detailed history of each test engine used for certification 
including the following:
    (i) A description of the test engine's construction, including a 
general description of the origin and buildup of the engine, steps taken 
to insure that it is representative of production engines, description 
of components specially built for the test engine, and the origin and 
description of all emission-related components;
    (ii) A description of the method used for engine service 
accumulation, including date(s) and the number of hours accumulated;
    (iii) A description of all maintenance, including modifications, 
parts changes, and other servicing performed, and the date(s), and 
reason(s) for such maintenance;
    (iv) A description of all emission tests performed including routine 
and standard test documentation, as specified in subpart E of this part, 
date(s), and the purpose of each test;
    (v) A description of all tests performed to diagnose engine or 
emission control performance, giving the date and time of each and the 
reason(s) for the test; and
    (vi) A description of any significant event(s) affecting the engine 
during the period covered by the history of the test engine but not 
described by an entry under one of the previous paragraphs of this 
section.
    (b) Routine emission test data, such as those reporting test cell 
temperature and relative humidity at start and finish of test and raw 
emission results from each mode or test phase, must be retained for a 
period of one year after issuance of all certificates of conformity to 
which they relate. All other information specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section must be retained for a period of eight years after issuance 
of all certificates of conformity to which they relate.
    (c) Records may be kept in any format and on any media, provided 
that, at the Administrator's request, organized, written records in 
English are promptly supplied by the manufacturer.

[[Page 157]]

    (d) The manufacturer must supply, at the Administrator's request, 
copies of any engine maintenance instructions or explanations issued by 
the manufacturer.


<R05>
Sec. 90.122  Amending the application and certificate of conformity.

    (a) The engine manufacturer must notify the Administrator when 
either an engine is to be added to a certificate of conformity or 
changes are to be made to a product line covered by a certificate of 
conformity. Notification occurs when the manufacturer submits an 
amendment to the original application prior to either producing such 
engines or making such changes to a product line.
    (b) The amendment must request that the engine manufacturer's 
existing certificate of conformity be amended and include the following 
information:
    (1) A full description of the engine to be added or the change(s) to 
be made in production;
    (2) The manufacturer's proposed test engine selection(s); and
    (3) Engineering evaluations or reasons why the original test engine 
is or is not still appropriate.
    (c) The Administrator may require the engine manufacturer to perform 
tests on an engine representing the engine to be added or changed.
    (d) Decision by Administrator. (1) Based on the submitted amendment 
and data derived from such testing as the Administrator may require or 
conduct, the Administrator must determine whether the proposed addition 
or change would still be covered by the certificate of conformity then 
in effect.
    (2) If the Administrator determines that the new or changed 
engine(s) meets the requirements of this subpart and the Act, the 
appropriate certificate of conformity will be amended.
    (3) If the Administrator determines that the proposed amendment 
would not be covered by the certificate of conformity, the Administrator 
must provide a written explanation to the engine manufacturer of his or 
her decision not to amend the certificate. The manufacturer may request 
a hearing on a denial.
    (e)(1) Alternatively, an engine manufacturer may make changes in or 
additions to production engines concurrently with amending the 
application as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, if the 
manufacturer determines that all affected engines will still meet 
applicable emission standards. The engine manufacturer must supply 
supporting documentation, test data, and engineering evaluations as 
appropriate to support its determination.
    (2) If, after a review, the Administrator determines additional 
testing is required, the engine manufacturer must provide required test 
data within 30 days or cease production of the affected engines.
    (3) If the Administrator determines that the affected engines do not 
meet applicable requirements, the Administrator will notify the engine 
manufacturer to cease production of the affected engines.


<R05>
Sec. 90.123  Denial, revocation of certificate of conformity.

    (a) If, after review of the engine manufacturer's application, 
request for certification, information obtained from any inspection, and 
any other information the Administrator may require, the Administrator 
determines that the test engine does not meet applicable standards and 
requirements, the Administrator will notify the manufacturer in writing, 
setting forth the basis for this determination.
    (b) Notwithstanding the fact that engines described in the 
application may comply with all other requirements of this subpart, the 
Administrator may deny the issuance of or revoke a previously issued 
certificate of conformity if the Administrator finds any one of the 
following infractions to be substantial:
    (1) The engine manufacturer submits false or incomplete information;
    (2) The engine manufacturer denies an EPA enforcement officer or EPA 
authorized representative the opportunity to conduct authorized 
inspections;
    (3) The engine manufacturer fails to supply requested information or 
amend its application to include all engines being produced;

[[Page 158]]

    (4) The engine manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data which 
it submits or otherwise circumvents the intent of the Act or this part; 
or
    (5) The engine manufacturer denies an EPA enforcement officer or EPA 
authorized representative reasonable assistance (as defined in 
Sec. 90.506).
    (c) If a manufacturer knowingly commits an infraction specified in 
paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(4) of this section or knowingly commits any 
fraudulent act which results in the issuance of a certificate of 
conformity, the Administrator may deem such certificate void ab initio.
    (d) When the Administrator denies or revokes a certificate of 
conformity, the engine manufacturer will be provided a written 
determination. The manufacturer may request a hearing on the 
Administrator's decision.
    (e) Any revocation of a certificate of conformity extends no further 
than to forbid the introduction into commerce of those engines 
previously covered by the certification which are still in the 
possession of the engine manufacturer, except in cases of such fraud or 
other misconduct that makes the certification void ab initio.


<R05>
Sec. 90.124  Request for hearing.

    (a) An engine manufacturer may request a hearing on the 
Administrator's denial or revocation of a certificate of conformity.
    (b) The engine manufacturer's request must be filed within 30 days 
of the Administrator's decision, be in writing, and set forth the 
manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's decision and data to 
support the objections.
    (c) If, after review of the request and supporting data, the 
Administrator finds that the request raises a substantial and factual 
issue, the Administrator will provide the engine manufacturer a hearing.

              Subpart D--Emission Test Equipment Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 90.301  Applicability.

    (a) This subpart describes the equipment required in order to 
perform exhaust emission tests on new nonroad spark-ignition engines and 
vehicles subject to the provisions of subpart A of part 90.
    (b) Exhaust gases, either raw or dilute, are sampled while the test 
engine is operated using a steady state test cycle on an engine 
dynamometer. The exhaust gases receive specific component analysis 
determining concentration of pollutant. Emission concentrations are 
converted to mass emission rates in grams per hour based on either fuel 
flow, fuel flow and engine intake air flow, or exhaust volume flow. 
Weighted emission rates are reported as grams per brake-kilowatt hour 
(g/kW-hr). See subpart E of this part for a complete description of the 
test procedure.
    (c) Additional information about system design, calibration 
methodologies, and so forth, for raw gas sampling can be found in part 
86, subpart D of this chapter. Examples for system design, calibration 
methodologies, and so forth, for dilute exhaust gas sampling can be 
found in part 86, subpart N of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 90.302  Definitions.

    The definitions in Sec. 90.3 apply to this subpart. The following 
definitions also apply to this subpart.
    Rated speed means the speed at which the manufacturer specifies the 
maximum rated power of an engine.
    Intermediate speed means the engine speed which is 85 percent of the 
rated speed.

subpart.
    (b) The symbols in Table 1 in Appendix A of this subpart apply to 
this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 90.304  Test equipment overview.

    (a) All engines subject to this subpart are tested for exhaust 
emissions. Engines are operated on dynamometers meeting the 
specification given in Sec. 90.305.
    (b) The exhaust is tested for gaseous emissions using a raw gas 
sampling system as described in Sec. 90.414 or a constant volume 
sampling (CVS) system as described in Sec. 90.421. Both systems require 
analyzers (see paragraph (c) of this section) specific to the pollutant 
being measured.
    (c) Analyzers used are a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) absorption 
type for carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide analysis; paramagnetic 
(PMD), zirconia (ZRDO), or electrochemical type (ECS) for oxygen 
analysis; a flame ionization (FID) or heated flame ionization (HFID) 
type for hydrocarbon analysis; and a chemiluminescent detector (CLD) or 
heated chemiluminescent detector (HCLD) for oxides of nitrogen analysis.

percent of National Institute for Standards and Testing (NIST) weights. 
Laboratories located in foreign countries may certify calibration 
weights to local government bureau standards.

Sec. 90.306  Dynamometer torque cell calibration.

    (a)(1) Any lever arm used to convert a weight or a force through a 
distance into a torque must be used in a horizontal position for 
horizontal shaft dynamometers (<plus-minus> five degrees). For vertical 
shaft dynamometers, a pulley system may be used to convert the 
dynamometer's horizontal loading into the vertical plane.
    (2) Calculate the indicated torque (IT) for each calibration weight 
to be used by:

IT=Moment Arm (meters)  x  Calibration Weight (Newtons)

    (3) Attach each calibration weight specified in Sec. 90.305(b)(2) to 
the moment arm at the calibration distance determined in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section. Record the power measurement equipment response 
(N-m) to each weight.
    (4) Compare the torque value measured to the calculated torque.
    (5) The measured torque must be within two percent of the calculated 
torque.
    (6) If the measured torque is not within two percent of the 
calculated torque, adjust or repair the system. Repeat steps in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section with the adjusted or 
repaired system.
    (b) Option. A master load-cell or transfer standard may be used to 
verify the torque measurement system.
    (1) The master load-cell and read out system must be calibrated 
using weights specified in Sec. 90.305(b)(2).
    (2) Attach the master load-cell and loading system.
    (3) Load the dynamometer to a minimum of three equally spaced torque 
values as indicated by the master load-cell for each in-use range used.
    (4) The in-use torque measurement must be within two percent of the 
torque measured by the master system for each load used.
    (5) If the in-use torque is not within two percent of the master 
torque, adjust or repair the system. Repeat steps in paragraphs (b)(2) 
through (b)(4) of this section with the adjusted or repaired system.

[[Page 160]]

    (c) Calibrated resistors may not be used for engine flywheel torque 
transducer calibration, but may be used to span the transducer prior to 
engine testing.
    (d) Other engine dynamometer system calibrations such as speed are 
performed as specified by the dynamometer manufacturer or as dictated by 
good engineering practice.


<R05>
Sec. 90.307  Engine cooling system.

    An engine cooling system is required with sufficient capacity to 
maintain the engine at normal operating temperatures as prescribed by 
the engine manufacturer. Auxiliary fan(s) may be used to maintain 
sufficient engine cooling during engine dynamometer operation.


<R05>
Sec. 90.308  Lubricating oil and test fuels.

    (a) Lubricating oil. Use the engine lubricating oil which meets the 
engine manufacturer's specifications for a particular engine and 
intended usage.
    (1) Manufacturers must use engine lubricants representative of 
commercially available engine lubricants.
    (2) For 2-stroke engines, the fuel/oil mixture ratio must be that 
which is recommended by the manufacturer.
    (b) Test Fuels--Certification. (1) The manufacturer must use 
gasoline having the specifications, or substantially equivalent 
specifications approved by the Administrator, as specified in Table 3 in 
Appendix A of this subpart for exhaust emission testing of gasoline 
fueled engines. As an option, manufacturers may use the fuel specified 
in Sec. 86.1313-94(a) of this chapter for gasoline fueled engines.
    (2) Alternative fuels, such as natural gas, propane, and methanol, 
used for exhaust emission testing and service accumulation of 
alternative fuel spark-ignition engines must be representative of 
commercially available alternative fuels.
    (i) The manufacturer shall recommend the alternative fuel to be used 
for certification testing and engine service accumulation in accordance 
with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (ii) The Administrator shall determine the alternative fuel to be 
used for testing and engine service accumulation, taking into 
consideration the alternative fuel recommended by the manufacturer.
    (3) Other fuels may be used for testing provided:
    (i) They are commercially viable;
    (ii) Information acceptable to the Administrator is provided to show 
that only the designated fuel would be used in customer service; and
    (iii) Fuel specifications are approved in writing by the 
Administrator prior to the start of testing.
    (c) Test Fuels--Service Accumulation. Unleaded gasoline 
representative of commercial gasoline generally available through retail 
outlets must be used in service accumulation for gasoline-fueled spark-
ignition engines. As an alternative, the certification test fuels 
specified under paragraph (b) of this section may be used for engine 
service accumulation. Leaded fuel may not be used during service 
accumulation. Additional fuel requirements for service accumulation are 
as follows:


<R05>
Sec. 90.309  Engine intake air temperature measurement.

    (a) The measurement location must be within 10 cm of the engine 
intake system (i.e., the air cleaner, for most engines.)
    (b) The temperature measurements must be accurate to within 
<plus-minus> 2  deg.C.


<R05>
Sec. 90.310  Engine intake air humidity measurement.

    This section refers to engines which are supplied with intake air 
other than the ambient air in the test cell (i.e., air which has been 
pumped directly to the engine air intake system). For engines which use 
ambient test cell air for the engine intake air, the ambient test cell 
humidity measurement may be used.
    (a) Humidity conditioned air supply. Air that has had its absolute 
humidity altered is considered humidity-conditioned air. For this type 
of intake air supply, the humidity measurements must be made within the 
intake air supply system and after the humidity conditioning has taken 
place.
    (b) Unconditioned air supply. Humidity measurements in unconditioned 
intake air supply systems must be made in the intake air stream entering 
the

[[Page 161]]

supply system. Alternatively, the humidity measurements can be measured 
within the intake air supply stream.


<R05>
Sec. 90.311  Test conditions.

    (a) General requirements. (1) Ambient temperature levels encountered 
by the test engine throughout the test sequence may not be less than 20 
deg.C or more than 30  deg.C. All engines must be installed on the test 
bed at their design installation angle to prevent abnormal fuel 
distribution.
    (2) Calculate all volumes and volumetric flow rates at standard 
conditions for temperature and pressure, and use these conditions 
consistently throughout all calculations. Standard conditions for 
temperature and pressure are 25  deg.C and 101.3 kPa.
    (b) Engine test conditions. Measure the absolute temperature 
(designated as T and expressed in Kelvin) of the engine air at the inlet 
to the engine and the dry atmospheric pressure (designated as p<INF>s 
and expressed in kPa), and determine the parameter f according to the 
following provisions for naturally aspirated engines:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR03JY95.009

For a certification test to be recognized as valid, the parameter f 
shall be between the limits as shown below: 0.96<f<1.04


<R05>
Sec. 90.312  Analytical gases.

    (a) The shelf life of a calibration gas may not be exceeded. The 
expiration date stated by the gas supplier must be recorded.
    (b) Pure gases. The required purity of the gases is defined by the 
contamination limits specified in this subsection. The following gases 
must be available for operation:
    (1) Purified nitrogen, also refered to as ``zero-grade nitrogen'' 
(Contamination <ls-thn-eq> 1 ppm C, <ls-thn-eq> 1 ppm CO, <ls-thn-eq> 
400 ppm CO<INF>2, <ls-thn-eq> 0.1 ppm NO);
    (2) Purified oxygen (Purity 99.5 percent vol O<INF>2);
    (3) Hydrogen-helium mixture (40 <plus-minus> 2 percent hydrogen, 
balance helium) (Contamination <ls-thn-eq> 1 ppm C, <ls-thn-eq> 400 ppm 
CO);
    (4) Purified synthetic air, also refered to as ``zero air'' or 
``zero gas'' (Contamination <ls-thn-eq> 1 ppm C, <ls-thn-eq> 1 ppm CO, 
<ls-thn-eq> 400 ppm CO<INF>2, <ls-thn-eq> 0.1 ppm NO) (Oxygen content 
between 18-21 percent vol.).
    (c) Calibration and span gases. (1) Calibration gas values are to be 
derived from NIST ``Standard Reference Materials'' (SRM's) and are to be 
single blends as specified in this subsection.
    (2) Mixtures of gases having the following chemical compositions 
must be available:

C<INF>3H<INF>8 and purified synthetic air and/or C<INF>3H<INF>8 and 
purified nitrogen;
CO and purified nitrogen;
NO<INF>X and purified nitrogen (the amount of NO<INF>2 contained in this 
calibration gas must not exceed five percent of the NO content);
CO<INF>2 and purified nitrogen.

    Note: For the HFID or FID the manufacturer may choose to use as a 
diluent span gas and the calibration gas either purified synthetic air 
or purified nitrogen. Any mixture of C<INF>3H<INF>8 and purified 
synthetic air which contains a concentration of propane higher than what 
a gas supplier considers to be safe may be substituted with a mixture of 
C<INF>3H<INF>8 and purified nitrogen. However, the manufacturer must be 
consistent in the choice of diluent (zero air or purified nitrogen) 
between the calibration and span gases. If a manufacturer chooses to use 
C<INF>3H<INF>8 and purified nitrogen for the calibration gases, then 
purified nitrogen must be the diluent for the span gases.

    (3) The true concentration of a span gas must be within <plus-minus> 
two percent of the NIST gas standard. The true concentration of a 
calibration gas must be within <plus-minus> one percent of the NIST gas 
standard. The use of precision blending devices (gas dividers) to obtain 
the required calibration gas concentrations is acceptable. Give all 
concentrations of calibration gas on a volume basis (volume percent or 
volume ppm).
    (4) The gas concentrations used for calibration and span may also be 
obtained by means of a gas divider, diluting either with purified 
N<INF>2 or with purified synthetic air. The accuracy of the mixing 
device must be such that the concentration of the diluted gases may be 
determined to within <plus-minus> two percent.
    (d) Oxygen interference check gases must contain propane with 350 
ppmC <plus-minus> 75 ppmC hydrocarbon. Determine the

[[Page 162]]

concentration value to calibration gas tolerances by chromatographic 
analysis of total hydrocarbons plus impurities or by dynamic blending. 
For gasoline fueled engines, oxygen contentration must be between 0 and 
1 percent O<INF>2. Nitrogen must be the predominant diluent with the 
balance oxygen.
    (e) Fuel for the hydrocarbon flame ionization detector (HC-FID) must 
be a blend of 40 <plus-minus> two percent hydrogen with the balance 
being helium. The mixture must contain less than one ppm equivalent 
carbon response; 98 to 100 percent hydrogen fuel may be used with 
advance approval of the Administrator.
    (f) Hydrocarbon analyzer burner air. The concentration of oxygen 
must be within one mole percent of the oxygen concentration of the 
burner air used in the latest oxygen interference check (percent 
O<INF>2I), see Sec. 90.316(d). If the difference in oxygen concentration 
is greater than one mole percent, then the oxygen interference must be 
checked and, if necessary, the analyzer adjusted to meet the percent 
O<INF>2I requirements. The burner air must contain less than two ppmC 
hydrocarbon.


<R05>
Sec. 90.313  Analyzers required.

    (a) Analyzers. Analyze measured gases with the following 
instruments:
    (1) Carbon monoxide (CO) analysis. (i) The carbon monoxide analyzer 
shall be of the non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) absorption type.
    (ii) The use of linearizing circuits is permitted.
    (2) Carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2) analysis. (i) The carbon dioxide 
analyzer shall be of the non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) absorption type.
    (ii) The use of linearizing circuits is permitted.
    (3) Oxygen (O<INF>2) analysis. Oxygen (O<INF>2) analyzers may be of 
the paramagnetic (PMD), zirconia (ZRDO) or electrochemical type (ECS).
    (4) Hydrocarbon (HC) analysis. (i) For Raw Gas Sampling, the 
hydrocarbon analyzer shall be of the heated flame ionization (HFID) 
type. For constant volume sampling, the hydrocarbon analyzer may be of 
the flame ionization (FID) type or of the heated flame ionization (HFID) 
type.
    (ii) For the HFID system, if the temperature of the exhaust gas at 
the sample probe is below 190 deg. C, the temperature of the valves, 
pipe work, and so forth, must be controlled so as to maintain a wall 
temperature of 190 deg. C <plus-minus>11 deg. C. If the temperature of 
the exhaust gas at the sample probe is above 190 deg. C, the temperature 
of the valves, pipe work, and so forth, must be controlled so as to 
maintain a wall temperature greater than 180 deg. C.
    (iii) For the HFID analyzer, the detector, oven, and sample-handling 
components within the oven must be suitable for continuous operation at 
temperatures to 200 deg. C. It must by capable of maintaining 
temperature within <plus-minus>5.5 deg. C of the set point.
    (iv) Fuel and burner air must conform to the specifications in 
Sec. 90.312.
    (v) The percent of oxygen interference must be less than three 
percent, as specified in Sec. 90.316(d).
    (5) Oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X) analysis.
    (i) This analysis device consists of the following items:
    (A) A NO<INF>2 to NO converter. The NO<INF>2 to NO converter 
efficiency must be at least 90 percent.
    (B) An ice bath located after the NO<INF>X converter (optional).
    (C) A chemiluminescent detector (CLD) or heated chemiluminescent 
detector (HCLD).
    (ii) The quench interference must be less than 3.0 percent as 
measured in Sec. 90.325.
    (b) Other analyzers and equipment. Other types of analyzers and 
equipment may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if 
approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (c) The following requirements must be incorporated as indicated in 
systems used for testing under this subpart.
    (1) Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide measurements must be made on 
a dry basis (for raw exhaust measurement only). Specific requirements 
for the means of drying the sample can be found in Sec. 90.313(e).
    (2) Calibration or span gases for the NO<INF>X measurement system 
must pass through the NO<INF>2 to NO converter.
    (d) The electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of the equipment must be 
on a level as to minimize additional errors.

[[Page 163]]

    (e) Gas drying. Chemical dryers are not an acceptable method of 
removing water from the sample. Water removal by condensation is 
acceptable. If water is removed by condensation, the sample gas 
temperature or sample dew point must be monitored either within the 
water trap or downstream and its temperature must not exceed 7 deg. C. A 
water trap performing this function is an acceptable method. Means other 
than condensation may be used only with prior approval from the 
Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 90.314  Analyzer accuracy and specifications.

    (a) Measurement and accuracy--general. The analyzers must have a 
measuring range which allows them to measure the concentrations of the 
exhaust gas sample pollutants with the accuracies shown in Table 2 in 
Appendix A of this subpart.
    (1) Precision. The precision of the analyzer must be, at worst, two 
percent of full-scale concentration for each range used. The precision 
is defined as 2.5 times the standard deviation(s) of 10 repetitive 
responses to a given calibration or span gas.
    (2) Noise. The analyzer peak-to-peak response to zero and 
calibration or span gases over any 10-second period must not exceed two 
percent of full-scale chart deflection on all ranges used.
    (3) Zero drift. The analyzer zero-response drift during a one-hour 
period must be less than two percent of full-scale chart deflection on 
the lowest range used. The zero-response is defined as the mean response 
including noise to a zero-gas during a 30-second time interval.
    (4) Span drift. The analyzer span drift during a one-hour period 
must be less than two percent of full-scale chart deflection on the 
lowest range used. The analyzer span is defined as the difference 
between the span-response and the zero-response. The span-response is 
defined as the mean response including noise to a span gas during a 30-
second time interval.
    (b) Operating procedure for analyzers and sampling system. Follow 
the start-up and operating instructions of the instrument manufacturer 
or use good engineering practice. Adhere to the minimum requirements 
given in Secs. 90.316 through 90.325 and Sec. 90.409.
    (c) Emission measurement accuracy--Bag sampling. (1) Good 
engineering practice dictates that exhaust emission sample analyzer 
readings below 15 percent of full-scale chart deflection should 
generally not be used.
    (2) Some high resolution read-out systems, such as computers, data 
loggers, and so forth, can provide sufficient accuracy and resolution 
below 15 percent of full scale. Such systems may be used provided that 
additional calibrations are made to ensure the accuracy of the 
calibration curves. The following procedure for calibration below 15 
percent of full scale may be used:

    Note to paragraph (c): If a gas divider is used, the gas divider 
must conform to the accuracy requirements as follows. The use of 
precision blending devices (gas dividers) to obtain the required 
calibration gas concentrations is acceptable, provided that the blended 
gases are accurate to within <plus-minus> 1.5 percent of NIST gas 
standards or other gas standards which have been approved by the 
Administrator. This accuracy implies that primary gases used for 
blending must be ``named'' to an accuracy of at least <plus-minus> one 
percent, traceable to NIST or other approved gas standards.

    (i) Span the full analyzer range using a top range calibration gas. 
The span gases must be accurate to within <plus-minus> two percent of 
NIST gas standards or other gas standards which have been approved by 
the Administrator.
    (ii) Generate a calibration curve according to, and meeting the 
requirements, of the sections describing analyzer calibrations which are 
found in Secs. 90.316, 90.317, 90.318, and 90.320.
    (iii) Select a calibration gas (a span gas may be used for 
calibrating the CO<INF>2 analyzer) with a concentration between the two 
lowest non-zero gas divider increments. This gas must be ``named'' to an 
accuracy of <plus-minus> one percent of NIST gas standards or other 
standards approved by the Administrator.
    (iv) Using the calibration curve fitted to the points generated in 
paragraphs (c)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section, check the concentration 
of the gas selected in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. The 
concentration derived from the curve

[[Page 164]]

must be within <plus-minus> 2.3 percent (<plus-minus> 2.8 percent for 
CO<INF>2 span gas) of the gas's original named concentration.
    (v) Provided the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this 
section are met, use the gas divider with the gas selected in paragraph 
(c)(2)(iii) of this section and determine the remainder of the 
calibration points. Fit a calibration curve per Secs. 90.316, 90.317, 
90.318, and 90.320 of this chapter for the entire analyzer range.
    (d) Emission measurement accuracy--continuous sampling. Analyzers 
used for continuous analysis must be operated such that the measured 
concentration falls between 15 and 100 percent of full-scale chart 
deflection. Exceptions to these limits are:
    (1) The analyzer's response may be less than 15 percent or more than 
100 percent of full scale if automatic range change circuitry is used 
and the limits for range changes are between 15 and 100 percent of full-
scale chart deflection;
    (2) The analyzer's response may be less than 15 percent of full 
scale if:
    (i) The alternative in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is used to 
ensure that the accuracy of the calibration curve is maintained below 15 
percent; or
    (ii) The full-scale value of the range is 155 ppm (C) or less; or
    (iii) The emissions from the engine are erratic and the integrated 
chart deflection value for the cycle is greater than 15 percent of full 
scale; or
    (iv) The contribution of all data read below the 15 percent level is 
less than 10 percent by mass of the final test results.


<R05>
Sec. 90.315  Analyzer initial calibration.

    (a) Warming-up time. The warming-up time should be according to the 
recommendations of the manufacturer. If not specified, a minimum of two 
hours should be allowed for warming up the analyzers.
    (b) NDIR, FID, and HFID analyzer. Tune and maintain the NDIR 
analyzer per the instrument manufacturer recommendations or 
specifications or using good engineering practice. The combustion flame 
of the FID or HFID analyzer must be optimized in order to meet the 
specifications in Sec. 90.316(b).
    (c) Zero setting and calibration. Using purified synthetic air (or 
nitrogen), set the CO, CO<INF>2, NO<INF>X, and HC analyzers at zero. 
Connect the appropriate calibrating gases to the analyzers and record 
the values. Use the same gas flow rates and pressure as when sampling 
exhaust.
    (d) Rechecking of zero setting. Recheck the zero setting and, if 
necessary, repeat the procedure described in paragraph (c) of this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 90.316  Hydrocarbon analyzer calibration.

    (a) Calibrate the FID and HFID hydrocarbon analyzer as described in 
this section. Operate the HFID to a set point <plus-minus> 5.5 deg. C 
between 185 and 197 deg. C.
    (b) Initial and periodic optimization of detector response. Prior to 
initial use and at least annually thereafter, adjust the FID and HFID 
hydrocarbon analyzer for optimum hydrocarbon response as specified in 
this paragraph. Alternative methods yielding equivalent results may be 
used, if approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (1) Follow good engineering practices for initial instrument start-
up and basic operating adjustment using the appropriate fuel (see 
Sec. 90.312) and purified synthetic air or zero-grade nitrogen.
    (2) Use of one of the following procedures is required for FID or 
HFID optimization:
    (i) The procedure outlined in Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) 
paper No. 770141, ``Optimization of a Flame Ionization Detector for 
Determination of Hydrocarbon in Diluted Automotive Exhausts;'' author, 
Glenn D. Reschke. This procedure has been incorporated by reference. See 
Sec. 90.7.
    (ii) The HFID optimization procedures outlined in Sec. 86.331-79 of 
this chapter.
    (iii) Alternative procedures may be used if approved in advance by 
the Administrator.
    (3) After the optimum flow rates have been determined, record them 
for future reference.
    (c) Initial and periodic calibration. Prior to initial use and 
monthly thereafter, or within one month prior to the certification test, 
the FID or HFID hydrocarbon analyzer must be calibrated

[[Page 165]]

on all normally used instrument ranges using the steps in this 
paragraph. Use the same flow rate and pressures as when analyzing 
samples. Introduce calibration gases directly at the analyzer. An 
optional method for dilute sampling described in Sec. 86.1310-
90(b)(3)(i) may be used.
    (1) Adjust analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the hydrocarbon analyzer with purified synthetic air or 
zero-grade nitrogen.
    (3) Calibrate on each used operating range with calibration gases 
having nominal concentrations between 10 and 90 percent of that range. A 
minimum of six evenly spaced points covering at least 80 percent of the 
10 to 90 range (64 percent) is required (see following table).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Example calibration points (%)        Acceptable for calibration?  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70.................  No, range covered is 50        
                                          percent, not 64.              
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90.........  Yes.                           
10, 25, 40, 55, 70, 85.................  Yes.                           
10, 30, 50, 70, 90.....................  No, though equally spaced and  
                                          entire range covered, a       
                                          minimum of six points are     
                                          needed.                       
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For each range calibrated, if the deviation from a least-squares best-
fit straight line is two percent or less of the value at each data 
point, calculate concentration values by use of a single calibration 
factor for that range. If the deviation exceeds two percent at any 
point, use the best-fit non-linear equation which represents the data to 
within two percent of each test point to determine concentration.
    (d) Oxygen interference optimization. Prior to initial use and 
monthly thereafter, perform the oxygen interference optimization as 
described in this paragraph. Choose a range where the oxygen 
interference check gases will fall in the upper 50 percent. Conduct the 
test, as outlined in this paragraph, with the oven temperature set as 
required by the instrument manufacturer. Oxygen interference check gas 
specifications are found in Sec. 90.312(d).
    (1) Zero the analyzer.
    (2) Span the analyzer with the 21 percent oxygen blend.
    (3) Recheck zero response. If it has changed more than 0.5 percent 
of full scale repeat paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section to 
correct the problem.
    (4) Introduce the five percent and 10 percent oxygen interference 
check gases.
    (5) Recheck the zero response. If it has changed by more than 
<plus-minus> one percent of full scale, repeat the test.
    (6) Calculate the percent of oxygen interference (designated as 
percent O<INF>2I) for each mixture in paragraph (d)(4) of this section 
according to the following equation.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR03JY95.010


[[Page 166]]


Where:

A = hydrocarbon concentration (ppmC) of the span gas used in paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section.
B = hydrocarbon concentration (ppmC) of the oxygen interference check 
gases used in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

    (7) The percent of oxygen interference (designated as percent 
O<INF>2I) must be less than <plus-minus> three percent for all required 
oxygen interference check gases prior to testing.
    (8) If the oxygen interference is greater than the specifications, 
incrementally adjust the air flow above and below the manufacturer's 
specifications, repeating paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(7) of this 
section for each flow.
    (9) If the oxygen interference is greater than the specification 
after adjusting the air flow, vary the fuel flow and thereafter the 
sample flow, repeating paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(7) of this section 
for each new setting.
    (10) If the oxygen interference is still greater than the 
specifications, repair or replace the analyzer, FID fuel, or burner air 
prior to testing. Repeat this section with the repaired or replaced 
equipment or gases.

Sec. 90.317  Carbon monoxide analyzer calibration.

    (a) Calibrate the NDIR carbon monoxide analyzer as described in this 
section.
    (b) Initial and periodic interference. Prior to its initial use and 
annually thereafter, check the NDIR carbon monoxide analyzer for 
response to water vapor and CO<INF>2:
    (1) Follow good engineering practices for instrument start-up and 
operation. Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance on the most 
sensitive range to be used.
    (2) Zero the carbon monoxide analyzer with either purified synthetic 
air or zero-grade nitrogen.
    (3) Bubble a mixture of three percent CO<INF>2 in N<INF>2 through 
water at room temperature and record analyzer response.
    (4) An analyzer response of more than one percent of full scale for 
ranges above 300 ppm full scale or more than three ppm on ranges below 
300 ppm full scale requires corrective action. (Use of conditioning 
columns is one form of corrective action which may be taken.)
    (c) Initial and periodic calibration. Prior to its initial use and 
monthly thereafter, or within one month prior to the certification test, 
calibrate the NDIR carbon monoxide analyzer.
    (1) Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the carbon monoxide analyzer with either purified synthetic 
air or zero-grade nitrogen.
    (3) Calibrate on each used operating range with carbon monoxide-in-
N<INF>2 calibration gases having nominal concentrations between 10 and 
90 percent of that range. A minimum of six evenly spaced points covering 
at least 80 percent of the 10 to 90 range (64 percent) is required (see 
following table).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Example calibration points (%)        Acceptable for calibration?  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70.................  No, range covered is 50        
                                          percent, not 64.              
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90.........  Yes.                           
10, 25, 40, 55, 70, 85.................  Yes.                           
10, 30, 50, 70, 90.....................  No, though equally spaced and  
                                          entire range covered, a       
                                          minimum of six points are     
                                          needed.                       
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional calibration points may be generated. For each range 
calibrated, if the deviation from a least-squares best-fit straight line 
is two percent or less of the value at each data point, calculate 
concentration values by use of a single calibration factor for that 
range. If the deviation exceeds two percent at any point, use the best-
fit non-linear equation which represents the data to within two percent 
of each test point to determine concentration.

described in this section.
    (b) Initial and Periodic Interference: Prior to its initial use and 
monthly

[[Page 167]]

thereafter, or within one month prior to the certification test, check 
the chemiluminescent oxides of nitrogen analyzer for NO<INF>2 to NO 
converter efficiency. Figure 1 in Appendix B of this subpart is a 
reference for paragraphs (b)(1) through (11) of this section:
    (1) Follow good engineering practices for instrument start-up and 
operation. Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the oxides of nitrogen analyzer with purified synthetic air 
or zero-grade nitrogen.
    (3) Connect the outlet of the NO<INF>X generator to the sample inlet 
of the oxides of nitrogen analyzer which has been set to the most common 
operating range.
    (4) Introduce into the NO<INF>X generator analyzer-system an NO-in-
nitrogen (N<INF>2) mixture with an NO concentration equal to 
approximately 80 percent of the most common operating range. The 
NO<INF>2 content of the gas mixture must be less than five percent of 
the NO concentration.
    (5) With the oxides of nitrogen analyzer in the NO mode, record the 
concentration of NO indicated by the analyzer.
    (6) Turn on the NO<INF>X generator O<INF>2 (or air) supply and 
adjust the O<INF>2 (or air) flow rate so that the NO indicated by the 
analyzer is about 10 percent less than indicated in paragraph (b)(5) of 
this section. Record the concentration of NO in this NO+O<INF>2 mixture 
as value ``c.''
    (7) Switch the NO<INF>X generator to the generation mode and adjust 
the generation rate so that the NO measured on the analyzer is 20 
percent of that measured in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. There must 
be at least 10 percent unreacted NO at this point. Record the 
concentration of residual NO as value ``d.''
    (8) Switch the oxides of nitrogen analyzer to the NO<INF>X mode and 
measure total NO<INF>X. Record this value as ``a.''
    (9) Switch off the NO<INF>X generator but maintain gas flow through 
the system. The oxides of nitrogen analyzer will indicate the NO<INF>X 
in the NO+O<INF>2 mixture. Record this value as ``b''.
    (10) Turn off the NO<INF>X generator O<INF>2 (or air) supply. The 
analyzer will now indicate the NO<INF>X in the original NO-in-N<INF>2 
mixture. This value should be no more than five percent above the value 
indicated in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (11) Calculate the efficiency of the NO<INF>X converter by 
substituting the concentrations obtained into the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR03JY95.049

Where:

a = concentration obtained in paragraph (b)(8),
b = concentration obtained in paragraph (b)(9),
c = concentration obtained in paragraph (b)(6),
d = concentration obtained in paragraph (b)(7).

    If converter efficiency is less than 90 percent, corrective action 
will be required.
    (c) Initial and periodic calibration. Prior to its initial use and 
monthly thereafter, or within one month prior to the certification test, 
calibrate the chemiluminescent oxides of nitrogen analyzer on all 
normally used instrument ranges. Use the same flow rate as when 
analyzing samples. Proceed as follows:
    (1) Adjust analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the oxides of nitrogen analyzer with purified synthetic air 
or zero-grade nitrogen.
    (3) Calibrate on each normally used operating range with NO-in-
N<INF>2 calibration gases having nominal concentrations between 10 and 
90 percent of that range. A minimum of six evenly spaced points covering 
at least 80 percent of the 10 to 90 range (64 percent) is required (see 
following table).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Example calibration points (%)        Acceptable for calibration?  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70.................  No, range covered is 50

10, 30, 50, 70, 90.....................  No, though equally spaced and  
                                          entire range covered, a       
                                          minimum of six points are     
                                          needed.                       
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional calibration points may be generated. For each range 
calibrated, if the deviation from a least-squares best-fit straight line 
is two percent or less of the value at each data point, calculate 
concentration values by use of a single calibration factor for that 
range. If the deviation exceeds two percent at any point, use the best-
fit non-linear equation which represents the data to within two percent 
of each test point to determine concentration.
    (d) The initial and periodic interference, system check, and 
calibration test procedures specified in Sec. 86.332-79 of this chapter 
may be used in lieu of the procedures specified in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 90.319  NO<INF>X converter check.

    (a) The efficiency of the converter used for the conversion of 
NO<INF>2 to NO is tested as given in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(8) of 
this section.
    (1) Using the test setup as shown in Figure 1 in Appendix B of this 
subpart (see also Sec. 90.318 of this chapter) and the procedure 
described in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(8) of this section, test the 
efficiency of converters by means of an ozonator.
    (2) Calibrate the HCLD or CLD in the most common operating range 
following the manufacturer's specifications using zero and span gas (the 
NO content of which must amount to about 80 percent of the operating 
range and the NO<INF>2 concentration of the gas mixture less than five 
percent of the NO concentration). The NO<INF>X analyzer must be in the 
NO mode so that the span gas does not pass through the converter. Record 
the indicated concentration.
    (3) Calculate the efficiency of the NO<INF>X converter as described 
in Sec. 90.318(b).
    (4) Via a T-fitting, add oxygen continuously to the gas flow until 
the concentration indicated is about 20 percent less than the indicated 
calibration concentration given in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. 
Record the indicated concentration ``c.'' The ozonator is kept 
deactivated throughout the process.
    (5) Activate the ozonator to generate enough ozone to bring the NO 
concentration down to about 20 percent (minimum 10 percent) of the 
calibration concentration given in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. 
Record the indicated concentration ``d.''

    Note: If, with the analyzer in the most common range, the NO<INF>X 
converter can not give a reduction from 80 percent to 20 percent, then 
use the highest range which will give the reduction.

    (6) Switch the NO analyzer to the NO<INF>X mode which means that the 
gas mixture (consisting of NO, NO<INF>2, O<INF>2 and N<INF>2) now passes 
through the converter. Record the indicated concentration ``a.''
    (7) Deactivate the ozonator. The mixture of gases described in 
paragraph (a)(6) of this section passes through the converter into the 
detector. Record the indicated concentration ``b.''
    (8) Switched to NO mode with the ozonator deactivated, the flow of 
oxygen or purified synthetic air is also shut off. The NO<INF>X reading 
of the analyzer may not deviate by more than <plus-minus> five percent 
of the theoretical value of the figure given in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section.
    (b) The efficiency of the converter must be tested prior to each 
calibration of the NO<INF>X analyzer.
    (c) The efficiency of the converter may not be less than 90 percent.

Sec. 90.320  Carbon dioxide analyzer calibration.

    (a) Prior to its initial use and monthly thereafter, or within one 
month prior to the certification test, calibrate the NDIR carbon dioxide 
analyzer as follows:
    (1) Follow good engineering practices for instrument start-up and 
operation. Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the carbon dioxide analyzer with either purified synthetic 
air or zero-grade nitrogen.

[[Page 169]]

    (3) Calibrate on each normally used operating range with carbon 
dioxide-in-N<INF>2 calibration or span gases having nominal 
concentrations between 10 and 90 percent of that range. A minimum of six 
evenly spaced points covering at least 80 percent of the 10 to 90 range 
(64 percent) is required (see following table).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Example calibration points (%)        Acceptable for Calibration?  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70.................  No, range covered is 50        
                                          percent, not 64.              
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90.........  Yes.                           
10, 25, 40, 55, 70, 85.................  Yes.                           
10, 30, 50, 70, 90.....................  No, though equally spaced and  
                                          entire range covered, a       
                                          minimum of six points are     
                                          needed.                       
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional calibration points may be generated. For each range 
calibrated, if the deviation from a least-squares best-fit straight line 
is two percent or less of the value at each data point, calculate 
concentration values by use of a single calibration factor for that 
range. If the deviation exceeds two percent at any point, use the best-
fit non-linear equation which represents the data to within two percent 
of each test point to determine concentration.
    (b) The initial and periodic interference, system check, and 
calibration test procedures specified in Secs. 86.316, 86.319, 86.320, 
86.321, and 86.322 of this chapter may be used in lieu of the procedures 
in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 90.321  NDIR analyzer calibration.

    (a) Detector optimization. If necessary, follow the instrument 
manufacturer's instructions for initial start-up and basic operating 
adjustments.
    (b) Calibration curve. Develop a calibration curve for each range 
used as follows:
    (1) Zero the analyzer.
    (2) Span the analyzer to give a response of approximately 90 percent 
of full-scale chart deflection.
    (3) Recheck the zero response. If it has changed more than 0.5 
percent of full scale, repeat the steps given in paragraphs (b)(1) and 
(b)(2) of this section.
    (4) Record the response of calibration gases having nominal 
concentrations between 10 and 90 percent of full-scale concentration. A 
minimum of six evenly spaced points covering at least 80 percent of the 
10 to 90 range (64 percent) is required (see following table).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Example calibration points (%)        Acceptable for calibration?  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70.................  No, range covered is 50        
                                          percent, not 64.              
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90.........  Yes.                           
10, 25, 40, 55, 70, 85.................  Yes.                           
10, 30, 50, 70, 90.....................  No, though equally spaced and  
                                          entire range covered, a       
                                          minimum of six points are     
                                          needed.                       
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (5) Generate a calibration curve. The calibration curve must be of 
fourth order or less, have five or fewer coefficients, and be of the 
form of the following equation (1) or (2). Include zero as a data point. 
Compensation for known impurities in the zero gas can be made to the 
zero-data point. The calibration curve must fit the data points within 
two percent of point or one percent of full scale, whichever is less.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR03JY95.011

where:

y = concentration
x = chart deflection

    (6) Option. A new calibration curve need not be generated if:
    (i) A calibration curve conforming to paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section exists; or,

[[Page 170]]

    (ii) The responses generated in paragraph (b)(4) of this section are 
within one percent of full scale or two percent of point, whichever is 
less, of the responses predicted by the calibration curve for the gases 
used in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (7) If multiple range analyzers are used, the lowest range used must 
meet the curve fit requirements below 15 percent of full scale.
    (c) Linear calibration criteria. If any range is within two percent 
of being linear, a linear calibration may be used. To determine if this 
criterion is met:
    (1) Perform a linear least-square regression on the data generated. 
Use an equation of the form y=mx, where x is the actual chart deflection 
and y is the concentration.
    (2) Use the equation z=y/m to find the linear chart deflection 
(designated as z) for each calibration gas concentration (designated as 
y).
    (3) Determine the linearity (designated as percent L) for each 
calibration gas by:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR03JY95.012

    (4) The linearity criterion is met if the %L is less than 
<plus-minus> two percent for each data point generated. For each 
emission test, use a calibration curve of the form Y=mx. The slope 
(designated as m) is defined for each range by the spanning process.


<R05>
Sec. 90.322  Calibration of other equipment.

    Calibrate other test equipment used for testing as often as required 
by the test equipment manufacturer or as necessary according to good 
engineering practice.


<R05>
Sec. 90.323  Analyzer bench checks.

    (a) Prior to initial use and after major repairs, verify that each 
analyzer complies with the specifications given in Table 2 in Appendix A 
of this subpart.
    (b) If a stainless steel NO<INF>2 to NO converter is used, condition 
all new or replacement converters. The conditioning consists of either 
purging the converter with air for a minimum of four hours or until the 
converter efficiency is greater than 90 percent. The converter must be 
at operational temperature while purging. Do not use this procedure 
prior to checking converter efficiency on in-use converters.


<R05>
Sec. 90.324  Analyzer leakage check.

    (a) Vacuum side leak check. (1) Check any location within the 
analysis system where a vacuum leak could affect the test results.
    (2) The maximum allowable leakage rate on the vacuum side is 0.5 
percent of the in-use flow rate for the portion of the system being 
checked. The analyzer flows and bypass flows may be used to estimate the 
in-use flow rates.
    (3) The sample probe and the connection between the sample probe and 
valve V2, see Figure 2 in Appendix B of this subpart, may be excluded 
from the leak check.
    (b) Pressure side leak check. The maximum allowable leakage rate on 
the pressure side is five percent of the in-use flow rate.


<R05>
Sec. 90.325  Analyzer interference checks.

    (a) Gases present in the exhaust other than the one being analyzed 
can interfere with the reading in several ways. Positive interference 
occurs in NDIR and PMD instruments when the interfering gas gives the 
same effect as the gas being measured, but to a lesser degree. Negative 
interference occurs in NDIR instruments by the interfering gas 
broadening the absorption band of the measured gas, and in CLD 
instruments by the interfering gas quenching the radiation. The 
interference checks described in this section are to be made initially 
and after any major repairs that could affect analyzer performance.
    (b) CO analyzer water and CO<INF>2 interference checks. Bubble 
through water at

[[Page 171]]

room temperature a CO<INF>2 span gas having a concentration of between 
80 percent and 100 percent inclusive of full scale of the maximum 
operating range used during testing and record the analyzer response. 
For dry measurements, this mixture may be introduced into the sample 
system prior to the water trap. The analyzer response must not be more 
than one percent of full scale for ranges equal to or above 300 ppm or 
more than three ppm for ranges below 300 ppm.
    (c) NO<SUP>X analyzer quench check. The two gases of concern for CLD 
(and HCLD) analyzers are CO<INF>2 and water vapor. Quench responses to 
these two gases are proportional to their concentrations and, therefore, 
require test techniques to determine quench at the highest expected 
concentrations experienced during testing.
    (1) NO<INF>X analyzer CO<INF>2 quench check. (i) Pass a CO<INF>2 
span gas having a concentration of 80 percent to 100 percent of full 
scale of the maximum operating range used during testing through the 
CO<INF>2 NDIR analyzer and record the value ``a.''
    (ii) Dilute the CO<INF>2 span gas approximately 50 percent with NO 
span gas and pass through the CO<INF>2 NDIR and CLD (or HCLD). Record 
the CO<INF>2 and NO values as ``b'' and ``c'' respectively.
    (iii) Shut off the CO<INF>2 and pass only the NO span gas through 
the CLD (or HCLD). Record the NO value as ``d.''
    (iv) Calculate the percent CO<INF>2 quench as follows, not to exceed 
three percent:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR03JY95.013

Where:

a=Undiluted CO<INF>2 concentration (percent)
b=Diluted CO<INF>2 concentration (percent)
c=Diluted NO concentration (ppm)
d=Undiluted NO concentration (ppm)

    (2) NO<INF>X analyzer water quench check. (i) This check applies to 
wet measurements only. An NO span gas having a concentration of 80 
percent to 100 percent of full scale of a normal operating range is 
passed through the CLD (or HCLD) and the response recorded as ``D''. The 
NO span gas is then bubbled through water at room temperature and passed 
through the CLD (or HCLD) and the analyzer's response recorded as AR. 
Determine and record the analyzer's absolute operating pressure and the 
bubbler water temperature. (It is important that the NO span gas 
contains minimal NO<INF>2 concentration for this check. No allowance for 
absorption of NO<INF>2 in water has been made in the following quench 
calculations.)
    (ii) Calculations for water quench must consider dilution of the NO 
span gas with water vapor and scaling of the water vapor concentration 
of the mixture to that expected during testing. Determine the mixture's 
saturated vapor pressure (designated as Pwb) that corresponds to the 
bubbler water temperature. Calculate the water concentration (``Z1'', 
percent) in the mixture by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR03JY95.014

where GP is the analyzer's standard operating pressure (pascals).
    (iii) Calculate the expected dilute NO span gas and water vapor 
mixture concentration (designated as D1) by the following equation:

Sec. 90.326  Pre- and post-test analyzer calibration.

    Calibrate the range of each analyzer used during the engine exhaust 
emission test prior to and after each test in accordance with the 
following:
    (a) Make the calibration by using a zero gas and a span gas. The 
span gas value must be between 75 percent and 100 percent of full scale, 
inclusive, of the measuring range.
    (b) Use the same analyzer(s) flow rate and pressure as that used 
during exhaust emission test sampling.
    (c) Warm-up and stabilize the analyzer(s) before the calibration is 
made.
    (d) If necessary clean and/or replace filter elements before 
calibration is made.
    (e) Calibrate analyzer(s) as follows:
    (1) Zero the analyzer using the appropriate zero gas. Adjust 
analyzer zero if necessary. Zero reading should be stable.
    (2) Span the analyzer using the appropriate span gas for the range 
being calibrated. Adjust the analyzer to the calibration set point if 
necessary.
    (3) Re-check zero and span set points.
    (4) If the response of the zero gas or span gas differs more than 
one percent of full scale, then repeat paragraphs (e) (1) through (3) of 
this section.

Sec. 90.327  Sampling system requirements.

    (a) Sample component surface temperature. For sampling systems which 
use heated components, use engineering judgment to locate the coolest 
portion of each component (pump, sample line section, filters, and so 
forth) in the heated portion of the sampling system that has a separate 
source of power or heating element. Monitor the temperature at that 
location. If several components are within an oven, then only the 
surface temperature of the component with the largest thermal mass and 
the oven temperature need be measured.
    (b) If water is removed by condensation, monitor the sample gas 
temperature or sample dew point either within the water trap or 
downstream. It may not exceed 7 deg. C.


<R05>
Sec. 90.328  Measurement equipment accuracy/calibration frequency table.

    (a) The accuracy of measurements must be such that the maximum 
tolerances shown in Table 2 in Appendix A of this subpart are not 
exceeded.
    (b) All equipment and analyzers must be calibrated according to the 
frequencies shown in Table 2 in Appendix A of this subpart.
    (c) Prior to initial use and after major repairs, bench check each 
analyzer (see Sec. 90.323).
    (d) Calibrate equipment as specified in Sec. 90.306 and Secs. 90.315 
through 90.322.
    (e) At least monthly, or after any maintenance which could alter 
calibration, perform the following calibrations and checks.
    (1) Leak check the vacuum side of the system (see Sec. 90.324(a)).
    (2) Verify that the automatic data collection system (if used) meets 
the requirements found in Table 2 in Appendix A of this subpart.

               Subpart E--Gaseous Exhaust Test Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 90.401  Applicability.

    (a) This subpart describes the procedures to follow in order to 
perform exhaust emission tests on new nonroad spark-ignition engines and 
vehicles subject to the provisions of subpart A of part 90. Provisions 
specific to raw gas sampling are in Sec. 90.414 through Sec. 90.419, 
provisions specific to constant volume sampling are in Sec. 90.420 
through Sec. 90.426. All other sections in this subpart apply to both 
raw gas sampling and constant volume sampling except where indicated 
otherwise.
    (b) Requirements for emission test equipment and calibrating this 
equipment are found in subpart D of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 90.402  Definitions.

    The definitions in Sec. 90.3, Sec. 90.101, and Sec. 90.302 apply to 
this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 90.403  Symbols, acronyms, and abbreviations.

    (a) The acronyms and abbreviations in Sec. 90.5 apply to this 
subpart.
    (b) The symbols in Table 1 in Appendix A to Subpart D apply to this 
subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 90.404  Test procedure overview.

    (a) The test consists of prescribed sequences of engine operating 
conditions to be conducted on an engine dynamometer or equivalent load 
and speed measurement device. The exhaust gases generated during engine 
operation are sampled either raw or dilute and specific components are 
analyzed through the analytical system.
    (b) The test is designed to determine the brake-specific emissions 
of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen 
and fuel consumption. The test consists of three different test cycles 
which are application specific for engines which span the typical 
operating range of nonroad spark-ignition engines. Two cycles exist for 
Class I and II engines and one is for Class III, IV, and V engines (see 
Sec. 90.103(a) and Sec. 90.116(b) for the definitions of Class I--V 
engines). The test cycles for Class I and II engines consist of one idle 
mode and five power modes at one speed (rated or intermediate). The test 
cycle for Class III, IV, and V engines consists of one idle mode at idle 
speed and one power mode at rated speed. These procedures require the 
determination of the concentration of each pollutant, fuel flow, and the 
power output during each mode. The measured values are weighted and used 
to calculate the grams of each pollutant emitted per brake kilowatt hour 
(g/kW-hr).
    (c)(1) When an engine is tested for exhaust emissions the complete 
engine must be tested, with all emission control devices installed and 
functioning.
    (2) On air cooled engines, the cooling fan must be installed. For 
engines whose cooling fan serves a dual purpose, such as an air pump/
blower, an external fan may be used to provide the engine with cooling 
air and the original cooling fan may be removed.
    (d) All emission control systems installed on or incorporated in the 
application must be functioning during all procedures in this subpart. 
In case of component malfunction or failure, no maintenance is allowed 
without prior approval from the Administrator, in accordance with 
Sec. 90.119.


<R05>
Sec. 90.405  Recorded information.

    (a) Record the information described in this section for each test, 
where applicable.
    (b) Test data; general. (1) Engine identification number.
    (2) Engine emission control system.
    (3) Test operator(s).
    (4) Number of hours of operation accumulated on the engine prior to 
beginning the warm-up portion of the test (to the nearest tenth hour).
    (5) Fuel identification.
    (6) For 2-stroke engines, fuel/oil mixture ratio.
    (7) Date of most recent analyzer bench calibration.
    (8) All pertinent instrument information such as tuning, gain, 
serial numbers, detector number, and calibration curve(s). As long as 
this information is traceable, it may be summarized by system number or 
analyzer identification numbers.
    (c) Test data; pre-test. (1) Date and time of day.
    (2) Test number.

[[Page 179]]

    (3) Barometric pressure; as an option, barometric pressure can be 
measured as a modal measurement instead of or in addition to a pre- and 
post-test measurement.
    (4) Recorder chart or equivalent. Identify for each test segment 
zero traces for each range used, and span traces for each range used.
    (d) Test data; modal. (1) Recorder chart or equivalent. Identify for 
each test mode the emission concentration traces and the associated 
analyzer range(s).
    (2) Observed engine torque.
    (3) Observed engine rpm.
    (4) Intake air flow if applicable.
    (5) Test cell temperature and humidity for each mode.
    (6) For raw gas testing; fuel flow for each mode. Fuel flow 
measurement is not required for dilute testing, but is allowed. If the 
fuel flow measurement is a volume measurement system, record the fuel 
temperature in the measurement system for fuel density corrections to 
the mass flow rate. If the fuel temperature is within 3 deg. C of the 
calibration temperature, no density correction is required.
    (7) Engine intake temperature and humidity, if applicable.
    (8) Exhaust mixing chamber surface temperature, if applicable.
    (9) Exhaust sample line temperature, if applicable.
    (10) Engine fuel inlet pressure.
    (e) Test data; post-test. (1) Recorder chart or equivalent. Identify 
the hang-up check.
    (2) Recorder chart or equivalent. Identify the zero traces for each 
range used and the span traces for each range used.
    (3) Total number of hours of operation accumulated on the engine (to 
the nearest tenth hour).
    (4) Barometric pressure, post-test segment.


<R05>
Sec. 90.406  Engine parameters to be measured and recorded.

    Measure or calculate, then record the engine parameters in Table 1 
in Appendix A of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 90.407  Engine inlet and exhaust systems.

    (a) The engine manufacturer is liable for exhaust emission 
compliance over the full range of air inlet filter systems and exhaust 
muffler systems.
    (b) The air inlet filter system and exhaust muffler system 
combination used on the test engine must be the systems expected to 
yield the highest emission levels.


<R05>
Sec. 90.408  Pre-test procedures.

    (a) Engine service accumulation and stabilization procedure. Use the 
service accumulation procedure determined by the manufacturer for 
exhaust emission stabilizing of an engine, consistent with good 
engineering practice (see Sec. 90.118).
    (1) The manufacturer determines, for each engine family, the number 
of hours at which the engine exhaust emission control system combination 
is stabilized for emission testing. However, this stabilization 
procedure may not exceed 12 hours. The manufacturer must maintain, and 
provide to the Administrator upon request, a record of the rationale 
used in making this determination. If the manufactuer can document that 
at some time prior to the full 12 hour service accumulation period the 
engine emissions are decreasing for the remainder of the 12 hours, the 
service accumulation may be completed at that time. The manufacturer may 
elect to accumulate 12 hours on each test engine within an engine family 
without making this determination.
    (2) During service accumulation, the fuel and lubricants specified 
in Sec. 90.308 must be used.
    (3) Engine maintenance during service accumulation is allowed only 
in accordance with Sec. 90.118.
    (b) Engine pre-test preparation. (1) Drain and charge the fuel 
tank(s) with the specified test fuel (see Sec. 90.308(b)) to 50 percent 
of the tank's nominal capacity. If an external fuel tank is used, the 
engine fuel inlet system pressure must be typical of what the engine 
will see in use.
    (2) Operate the engine on the dynamometer measuring the fuel 
consumption (fuel consumption required only for raw gas sampling method) 
and

[[Page 180]]

torque before and after the emission sampling equipment is installed, 
including the sample probe, using the modes specified in the following 
table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               Operating
              Engine class                    Test cycle          mode  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I, II..................................  A                            6 
I, II..................................  B                            1 
III, IV, V.............................  C                            1 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    These modes are from Table 2 in Appendix A of this subpart. The 
emission sampling equipment may not significantly affect the operational 
characteristics of the engine (typically the results should agree within 
five percent).
    (c) Analyzer pre-test procedures. (1) If necessary, warm up and 
stabilize the analyzer(s) before calibrations are performed.
    (2) Replace or clean the filter elements and then leak check the 
system as required by Sec. 90.324(a). If necessary, allow the heated 
sample line, filters, and pumps to reach operating temperature.
    (3) Perform the following system checks:
    (i) If necessary, check the sample-line temperature. Heated FID 
sample line temperature must be maintained between 110 deg. C and 
230 deg. C; a heated NO<INF>X sample line temperature must be maintained 
between 60 deg. C and 230 deg. C.
    (ii) Check that the system response time has been accounted for 
prior to sample collection data recording.
    (iii) A HC hang-up check is permitted (see Sec. 90.413(e)).
    (4) Check analyzer zero and span before and after each test at a 
minimum. Further, check analyzer zero and span any time a range change 
is made or at the maximum demonstrated time span for stability for each 
analyzer used.
    (d) Check system flow rates and pressures and reset, if necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 90.409  Engine dynamometer test run.

    (a) Engine and dynamometer start-up. (1) Only adjustments in 
accordance with Sec. 90.119 may be made to the test engine prior to 
starting a test.
    (2) If necessary, warm up the dynamometer as recommended by the 
dynamometer manufacturer or use good engineering practice.
    (3) At the manufacturer's option, the engine can be run with the 
throttle in a fixed position or by using the engine's governor (if the 
engine is manufactured with a governor). In either case, the engine 
speed and load must meet the requirements specified in paragraph (b)(12) 
of this section.
    (b) Each test consists of the following steps.
    (1) Record the general test data as specified in Sec. 90.405(b).
    (2) Precondition the engine in the following manner;
    (i) Operate the engine at a power greater than or equal to 50 
percent maximum power at the appropriate speed (rated or intermediate) 
for 20 minutes;
    (ii) Option. If the engine has been operating on service 
accumulation for a minimum of 40 minutes, the service accumulation may 
be substituted for step (i).
    (3) Record all pre-test data specified in Sec. 90.405(c).
    (4) Start the test cycle (see Sec. 90.410) within five minutes of 
the completion of the steps required by paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (5) Modes are to be performed in the numerical order specified for 
the appropriate test cycle (see ``Mode Points'' Table 2 in Appendix A of 
this subpart).
    (6) For Class I and II engines, during the maximum torque mode 
calculate the torque corresponding to 75, 50, 25, and 10 percent of the 
maximum observed torque (see Table 2 in Appendix A to this subpart).
    (7) Once engine speed and load are set for a mode, run the engine 
for a sufficient period of time to achieve thermal stability. At the 
manufacturer's option, determine and document the appropriate criterion 
for thermal stability for each engine family. If the manufacture chooses 
not to make this determination, an acceptable alternative is to run the 
engine at each mode until the cylinder head temperature remains within a 
10 deg.C bandwidth for three minutes. Cylinder head temperature may be 
measured at the base of the spark plug. After stability is achieved, 
emission measurements are initiated.
    (8) Record all modal data specified in Sec. 90.405(d) for a minimum 
time period of the last two minutes of each mode.

[[Page 181]]

Longer averaging periods are acceptable, but the data averaged must be 
from a continuous time period. The duration of time during which this 
data is recorded is referred to as the ``sampling period.'' The data 
collected during the sampling period is used for modal emission 
calculations.
    (9) Continuously record the analyzer's response to the exhaust gas 
during each mode.
    (10) Modes may be repeated.
    (11) If a delay of more than one hour occurs between the end of one 
mode and the beginning of another mode, the test is void and must be 
restarted at paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (12) The engine speed and load must be maintained within the 
requirements of Sec. 90.410 during the sampling period of each mode. If 
this requirement is not met, the mode is void and must be restarted.
    (13) If at any time during a mode the test equipment malfunctions or 
the specifications in Sec. 90.410 can not be met, the test is void and 
must be aborted. Corrective action should be taken and the test 
restarted.
    (14) If at any time during an operating mode the engine stalls, 
restart the engine immediately and continue the test starting with the 
steps required by paragraph (b)(6) of this section. If the engine will 
not restart within five minutes the test is void. If maintenance is 
required on the engine, advance approval from the Administrator is 
required as specified in Sec. 90.119. After corrective action is taken, 
the engine may be rescheduled for testing. Report the reason for the 
malfunction (if determined) and the corrective action taken.
    (15) Fuel flow and air flow during the idle condition may be 
determined just prior to or immediately following the dynamometer 
sequence, if longer times are required for accurate measurements. If the 
dilute sampling method (Constant Volume Sampling) is used, neither fuel 
flow nor air flow measurements are required.
    (c) Exhaust gas measurements. (1) Measure HC, CO, CO<INF>2, and 
NO<INF>X concentration in the exhaust sample.
    (2) Each analyzer range that may be used during a test mode must 
have the zero and span responses recorded prior to the start of the 
test. Only the range(s) used to measure the emissions during the test is 
required to have its zero and span recorded after the completion of the 
test. Depending on the stability of each individual analyzer, more 
frequent zero checks or spans between modes may be necessary.
    (3) It is permitted to change filter elements between modes.
    (4) A leak check is permitted between modes.
    (5) A hang-up check is permitted between modes (see Sec. 90.413).
    (6) If, during the emission measurement portion of a mode, the value 
of the gauges downstream of the NDIR analyzer(s) G3 or G4 (see Figure 2 
in Appendix B of Subpart D), differs by more than <plus-minus>0.5kPa 
from the pretest value, the test mode is void.


<R05>
Sec. 90.410  Engine test cycle.

    (a) Follow the appropriate 6-mode test cycle for Class I and II 
engines and 2-mode test cycle for Class III, IV, and V engines when 
testing spark-ignition engines (see Table 2 in Appendix A of this 
subpart).
    (b) During each non-idle mode, hold both the specified speed and 
load within <plus-minus> five percent of point. During the idle mode, 
hold speed within <plus-minus> ten percent of the manufacturer's 
specified idle engine speed.
    (c) If the operating conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section for Class I and II engines using Mode Points 2, 3, 4, and 5 
cannot be maintained, the Administrator may authorize deviations from 
the specified load conditions. Such deviations may not exceed 10 percent 
of the maximum torque at the test speed. The minimum deviations, above 
and below the specified load, necessary for stable operation shall be 
determined by the manufacturer and approved by the Administrator prior 
to the test run.
    (d) Do not include power generated during the idle mode, Mode 11, in 
the calculation of emission results.


<R05>
Sec. 90.411  Post-test analyzer procedures.

    (a) Perform a HC hang-up check within 60 seconds of the completion 
of the last mode in the test. Use the following procedure:

[[Page 182]]

    (1) Introduce a zero gas or room air into the sample probe or valve 
V2 (see Figure 2 in Appendix B of Subpart D) to check the ``hangup 
zero'' response. Simultaneously start a time measurement.
    (2) Select the lowest HC range used during the test.
    (3) Within four minutes of beginning the time measurement in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the difference between the zero gas 
response and the hang-up zero response may not be greater than 5.0 
percent of full scale or 10 ppmC, whichever is greater.
    (b) Begin the analyzer span checks within six minutes after the 
completion of the last mode in the test. Record for each analyzer the 
zero and span response for each range used during the preceding test or 
test segment.
    (c) If during the test, the filter element(s) were replaced or 
cleaned, a vacuum check must be performed per Sec. 90.324(a) immediately 
after the span checks. If the vacuum side leak check does not meet the 
requirements of Sec. 90.324(a), the test is void.
    (d) Read and record the post-test data specified in Sec. 90.405(e).
    (e) For a valid test, the analyzer drift between the before-segment 
and after-segment span checks for each analyzer must meet the following 
requirements:
    (1) The span drift (defined as the change in the difference between 
the zero response and the span response) may not exceed two percent of 
full-scale chart deflection for each range used.
    (2) The zero response drift may not exceed two percent of full-scale 
chart deflection for each range used above 155 ppm (or ppm C), or three 
percent of full-scale chart deflection for each range below 155 ppm (or 
ppm C).


<R05>
Sec. 90.412  Data logging.

    (a) A computer or any other automatic data collection (ADC) 
device(s) may be used as long as the system meets the requirements of 
this subpart.
    (b) Determine from the data collection records the analyzer 
responses corresponding to the end of each mode.
    (c) Record data at a minimum of rate of one Hz (one time per 
second).
    (d) Determine the final value for power by averaging the 
individually calculated power points for each value of speed and torque 
recorded during the sampling period. As an alternative, the final value 
for power can be calculated from the average values for speed and 
torque, collected during the sampling period.
    (e) Determine the final value for CO<INF>2, CO, HC, and NO<INF>X 
concentrations by averaging the concentration of each point taken during 
the sample period for each mode.


<R05>
Sec. 90.413  Exhaust sample procedure--gaseous components.

    (a) Automatic data collection equipment requirements. The analyzer 
response may be read by automatic data collection (ADC) equipment such 
as computers, data loggers, and so forth. If ADC equipment is used, the 
following is required:
    (1) For dilute grab (``bag'') sample analysis, the analyzer response 
must be stable at greater than 99 percent of the final reading for the 
dilute exhaust sample. The ADC must store a single value representing 
the average chart deflection over a 10-second stabilized period. 
Alternatively, the ADC may store the individual instantaneous chart 
deflections collected over a 10-second stabilized period.
    (2) For continuous analysis systems, the ADC must store a single 
value representing the average integrated concentration over a 
measurement period. Alternatively, the ADC may store the individual 
instantaneous values collected during the measurement period.
    (3) The chart deflections or average integrated concentrations 
required in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section may be stored 
on long-term computer storage devices such as computer tapes, storage 
discs, punch cards, or they may be printed in a listing for storage. In 
either case a chart recorder is not required and records from a chart 
recorder, if they exist, need not be stored.
    (4) If ADC equipment is used to interpret analyzer values, the ADC 
equipment is subject to the calibration specifications of the analyzer 
as if the ADC equipment is part of analyzer system.
    (b) Data records from any one or a combination of analyzers may be 
stored as chart recorder records.

[[Page 183]]

    (c) Grab sample analysis. For dilute grab sample analysis perform 
the following procedure:
    (1) Calibrate analyzers using the procedure described in 
Sec. 90.326.
    (2) Record the most recent zero and span response as the pre-
analysis values.
    (3) Measure and record HC, CO, CO<INF>2, and NO<INF>X concentrations 
in the exhaust sample bag(s) and background sample bag(s) using the same 
flow rates and pressures.
    (4) Good engineering practice dictates that exhaust emission sample 
bag analyzer readings below 15 percent of full scale should generally 
not be used.
    (5) A post-analysis zero and span calibration check of each range 
must be performed and the values recorded. The number of events that may 
occur between the pre- and post-checks is not specified. However, the 
difference between pre-analysis zero and span values (recorded in 
paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section) versus those recorded for 
the post-analysis check may not exceed the zero drift limit or the span 
drift limit of two percent of full-scale chart deflection for any range 
used. Otherwise the analysis is void.
    (d) Continuous sample analysis. For continuous sample analysis 
perform the following procedure:
    (1) Calibrate analyzers using the procedure described in 
Sec. 90.326.
    (2) Leak check portions of the sampling system that operate at 
negative gauge pressures when sampling and allow heated sample lines, 
filters, pumps, and so forth to stabilize at operating temperature.
    (3) Option: Determine the HC hang-up for the FID or HFID sampling 
system:
    (i) Zero the analyzer using zero gas introduced at the analyzer 
port.
    (ii) Flow zero gas through the overflow sampling system. Check the 
analyzer response.
    (iii) If the overflow zero response exceeds the analyzer zero 
response by two percent or more of the FID or HFID full-scale 
deflection, hang-up is indicated and corrective action must be taken 
(see paragraph (e) of this section).
    (iv) The complete system hang-up check specified in paragraph (e) of 
this section is recommended as a periodic check.
    (4) If necessary, recalibrate analyzer using the procedure specified 
in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (5) Good engineering practice dictates that analyzers used for 
continuous analysis should be operated such that the measured 
concentration falls between 15 percent and 100 percent of full scale.
    (6) Record the most recent zero and span response as the pre-
analysis values.
    (7) Collect background HC, CO, CO<INF>2, and NO<INF>X in a sample 
bag (for dilute exhaust sampling only, see Sec. 90.422).
    (8) Perform a post-analysis zero and span check for each range used 
at the conditions specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Record 
these responses as the post-analysis values.
    (9) Neither the zero drift nor the span drift between the pre-
analysis and post-analysis checks on any range used may exceed three 
percent for HC, or two percent for NO<INF>X, CO, and CO<INF>2, of full-
scale chart deflection, or the test is void. (If the HC drift is greater 
than three percent of full-scale chart deflection, HC hang-up is 
likely.)
    (10) Determine background levels of HC, NO<INF>X, CO, or CO<INF>2 
(for dilute exhaust sampling only) by the grab (``bag'') technique 
outlined in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (e) Hydrocarbon hang-up. If HC hang-up is indicated, the following 
procedure may be performed:
    (1) Fill a clean, evacuated sample bag with background air.
    (2) Zero and span the HFID at the analyzer ports.
    (3) Analyze the background air sample bag through the analyzer 
ports.
    (4) Analyze the background air through the entire sample probe 
system.
    (5) If the difference between the readings obtained is two ppm or 
more, clean the sample probe and the sample line.
    (6) Reassemble the sample system, heat to specified temperature, and 
repeat the procedure in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(5) of this 
section.

[[Page 184]]


<R05>
Sec. 90.414  Raw gaseous exhaust sampling and analytical system description.

    (a) Schematic drawing. An example of a sampling and analytical 
system which may be used for testing under this subpart is shown in 
Figure 2 in Appendix B of Subpart D. All components or parts of 
components that are wetted by the sample or corrosive calibration gases 
must be either chemically cleaned stainless steel or inert material 
(e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene resin). The use of ``gauge savers'' or 
``protectors'' with nonreactive diaphragms to reduce dead volumes is 
permitted.
    (b) Sample probe. (1) The sample probe must be a straight, closed 
end, stainless steel, multi-hole probe. The inside diameter may not be 
greater than the inside diameter of the sample line +0.03 cm. The wall 
thickness of the probe may not be greater than 0.10 cm. The fitting that 
attaches the probe to the exhaust pipe must be as small as practical in 
order to minimize heat loss from the probe.
    (2) The probe must have a minimum of three holes. The spacing of the 
radial planes for each hole in the probe must be such that they cover 
approximately equal cross-sectional areas of the exhaust duct. See 
Figure 2 in Appendix B of Subpart D. The angular spacing of the holes 
must be approximately equal. The angular spacing of any two holes in one 
plane may not be 180 deg. <plus-minus> 20 deg. (i.e., section view C-C 
of Figure 2 in Appendix B of Subpart D). The holes should be sized such 
that each has approximately the same flow. If only three holes are used, 
they may not all be in the same radial plane.
    (3) The exhaust gas probe must be located in a position which yields 
a well mixed, homogenous sample of the engine exhaust. The probe must 
extend radially across the exhaust gas stream. The probe must pass 
through the approximate center and must extend across at least 80 
percent of the exhaust gas stream. The exact position of the probe may 
vary from engine family to engine family.
    (c) Mixing chamber. The exhaust mixing chamber is located in the 
exhaust system between the muffler and the sample probe. The mixing 
chamber is an optional component of the raw gas sampling equipment.
    (1) The internal volume of the mixing chamber may not be less than 
ten times the cylinder displacement of the engine under test. The shape 
of the mixing chamber must be such that it provides a well mixed, 
homogenous sample at the sample probe location.
    (2) Couple the mixing chamber as closely as possible to the engine 
muffler.
    (3) Maintain the inner surface of the mixing chamber at a minimum 
temperature of 179 deg. C.
    (4) Thermocouple temperature monitoring of the mixing chamber inner 
surface is required to assure wall temperatures specified in paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section. The temperature measurement must be accurate to 
within <plus-minus> 5 deg. C.
    (5) The sample probe must extend radially across the exit of the 
mixing chamber. The probe must pass through the approximate center and 
must extend across at least 80 percent of the diameter of the exit. The 
exact position of the probe may vary from engine family to engine 
family. The probe must be located in a position which yields a well 
mixed, homogenous sample of the exhaust.
    (d) Sample transfer line. (1) The maximum inside diameter of the 
sample line may not exceed 1.32 cm.
    (2) If valve V2 in Figure 1 of Appendix B of this subpart is used, 
the sample probe must connect directly to valve V2. The location of 
optional valve V2 in Figure 1 of Appendix B of Subpart D may not be 
greater than 1.22 m from the exhaust duct.
    (3) The location of optional valve V16, Figure 1 of Appendix B of 
this subpart, may not be greater than 61 cm from the sample pump. The 
leakage rate for this section on the pressure side of the sample pump 
may not exceed the leakage rate specification for the vacuum side of the 
pump.
    (e) Venting. All vents, including analyzer vents, bypass flow, and 
pressure relief vents, of regulators should be vented in such a manner 
as to avoid endangering personnel in the immediate area.

[[Page 185]]

    (f) Any variation from the specifications in this subpart, including 
performance specifications and emission detection methods, may be used 
only with prior approval by the Administrator.
    (g) Additional components, such as instruments, valves, solenoids, 
pumps, switches, and so forth, may be employed to provide additional 
information and coordinate the functions of the component systems.
    (h) The following requirements must be incorporated in each system 
used for raw testing under this subpart.
    (1) Take the sample for all components with one sample probe and 
split it internally to the different analyzers.
    (2) Heat the sample transport system from the engine exhaust pipe to 
the HC analyzer for the raw gas sampling method as indicated in Figure 1 
in Appendix B of this subpart. The NO<INF>X analyzer for the raw gas 
sampling method may be heated as indicated in Figure 1 in Appendix B of 
this subpart. The HC analyzer and the NO<INF>X analyzer for the dilute 
sampling method may be heated as indicated in Figure 1 in Appendix B of 
this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 90.415  Raw gaseous sampling procedures.

    Fit all heated sampling lines with a heated filter to extract solid 
particles from the flow of gas required for analysis. The sample line 
for HC measurement must be heated. The sample line for CO, CO<INF>2 and 
NO<INF>X analysis may be heated or unheated.


<R05>
Sec. 90.416  Intake air flow measurement specifications.

    (a) If used, the engine intake air flow measurement method used must 
have a range large enough to accurately measure the air flow over the 
engine operating range during the test. Overall measurement accuracy 
must be two percent of full-scale value of the measurement device for 
all modes except the idle mode. For the idle mode, the measurement 
accuracy must be <plus-minus> five percent or less of the full-scale 
value. The Administrator must be advised of the method used prior to 
testing.
    (b) When an engine system incorporates devices that affect the air 
flow measurement (such as air bleeds, air injection, pulsed air, and so 
forth) resulting in understated exhaust emission results, make 
corrections to the exhaust emission results to account for such effects.


<R05>
Sec. 90.417  Fuel flow measurement specifications.

    (a) Fuel flow measurement is required only for raw testing. Fuel 
flow is allowed for dilute testing. If the measured fuel flow is used in 
the dilute calculations for brake-specific fuel consumption (see 
Sec. 90.426(e)), the fuel flow instrument must meet the requirements of 
this section.
    (b) The fuel flow measurement instrument must have a minimum 
accuracy of one percent of full-scale flow rate for each measurement 
range used. An exception is allowed for the idle mode. For this mode, 
the minimum accuracy is <plus-minus> five percent of full-scale flow 
rate for the measurement range used. The controlling parameters are the 
elapsed time measurement of the event and the weight or volume 
measurement.


<R05>
Sec. 90.418  Data evaluation for gaseous emissions.

    For the evaluation of the gaseous emissions recording, record the 
last four minutes of each mode and determine the average values for HC, 
CO, CO<INF>2 and NO<INF>X during each mode from the average 
concentration readings determined from the corresponding calibration 
data. Longer averaging times are acceptable, but the sampling period 
which is reported must be a continuous set of data.

<R05>
Sec. 90.420  CVS concept of exhaust gas sampling system.

    (a) A dilute exhaust sampling system is designed to directly measure 
the true mass of emissions in engine exhaust without the necessity of 
measuring either fuel flow or intake air flow. This is accomplished by 
diluting the exhaust produced by a test engine with ambient background 
air and measuring the total diluted exhaust flow rate and the 
concentration of emissions within the dilute flow. Total mass flow of an 
emission is then easily calculated.
    (b) A constant volume sampler (CVS) is typically used to control the 
total amount of dilute flow through the system. As the name implies, a 
CVS restricts flow to a known value dependent only on the dilute exhaust 
temperature and pressure.
    (c) For the testing described in this subpart, a CVS must consist 
of: a mixing tunnel into which the engine exhaust and dilutant 
(background) air are dumped; a dilute exhaust flow metering system; a 
dilute exhaust sample port; a background sample port; a dilute exhaust 
sampling system; and a background sampling system.
    (1) Mixing tunnel. The mixing tunnel must be constructed such that 
complete mixing of the engine exhaust and background air is assured 
prior to the sampling probe.

[[Page 189]]

    (2) Exhaust flow metering system. A dilute exhaust flow metering 
system must be used to control the total flow rate of the dilute engine 
exhaust as described in Sec. 90.421.
    (3) Exhaust sample port. A dilute exhaust sample port must be 
located in or downstream of the mixing tunnel at a point where complete 
mixing of the engine exhaust and background air is assured.
    (4) Background sample port. A dilute exhaust sample port must be 
located in the stream of background air before it is mixed with the 
engine exhaust. The background probe must draw a representative sample 
of the background air during each sampling mode.
    (5) Exhaust sampling system. The dilute exhaust sampling system 
controls the flow of samples from the mixing tunnel to the analyzer 
system. This could be either a continuous sampling system or grab (bag) 
sampling system. If a critical flow venturi (CFV) is used on the dilute 
exhaust sample probe, this system must assure that the sample CFV is in 
choke flow during testing. If no CFV is used, this system must assure a 
constant volumetric flow rate through the dilute exhaust sample probe or 
must incorporate electronic flow compensation.
    (6) Background sampling system. The background sampling system 
controls the flow of samples from the background air supply to the 
analyzer system. This could be either a continuous sampling system or 
grab (bag) sampling system. This system must assure a constant 
volumetric flow rate through the background sample probe.


<R05>
Sec. 90.421  Dilute gaseous exhaust sampling and analytical system description.

    (a) General. The exhaust gas sampling system described in this 
section is designed to measure the true mass of gaseous emissions in the 
exhaust of nonroad small spark-ignition engines. This system utilizes 
the Constant Volume Sampling (CVS) concept (described in Sec. 90.420) of 
measuring mass emissions of HC, NO<INF>X, CO, and CO<INF>2. Grab 
sampling for individual modes is an acceptable method of dilute testing 
for all constituents, HC, NO<INF>X, CO, and CO<INF>2. Continuous dilute 
sampling is not required for any of the exhaust constituents, but is 
allowable for all. Heated sampling is not required for any of the 
constituents, but is allowable for HC and NO<INF>X. The mass of gaseous 
emissions is determined from the sample concentration and total flow 
over the test period. As an option, the measurement of total fuel mass 
consumed over a cycle may be substituted for the exhaust measurement of 
CO<INF>2. General requirements are as follows:
    (1) This sampling system requires the use of a Positive Displacement 
Pump--Constant Volume Sampler (PDP-CVS) system with a heat exchanger, or 
a Critical Flow Venturi--Constant Volume Sampler (CFV-CVS) system with 
CFV sample probes and/or a heat exchanger or electronic flow 
compensation. Figure 2 in Appendix B of this subpart is a schematic 
drawing of the PDP-CVS system. Figure 3 in Appendix B of this subpart is 
a schematic drawing of the CFV-CVS system.
    (2) The HC analytical system requires:
    (i) Grab sampling (see Sec. 90.420, and Figure 2 or Figure 3 in 
Appendix B of this subpart) and analytical capabilities (see 
Sec. 90.423, and Figure 4 in Appendix B of this subpart), or
    (ii) Continuously integrated measurement of diluted HC meeting the 
minimum requirements and technical specifications contained in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section.
    (iii) The dilute HC analytical system for nonroad small spark-
ignition engines does not require a heated flame ionization detector 
(HFID).
    (iv) If used, the HFID sample must be taken directly from the 
diluted exhaust stream through a heated probe and integrated 
continuously over the test cycle.
    (v) The heated probe must be located in the sampling system far 
enough downstream of the mixing area to ensure a uniform sample 
distribution across the CVS duct at the sampling zone.
    (3) The CO and CO<INF>2 analytical system requires:
    (i) Grab sampling (see Sec. 90.420, and Figure 2 or Figure 3 in 
Appendix B of this subpart) and analytical capabilities (see 
Sec. 90.423, and Figure 4 in Appendix B of this subpart), or

[[Page 190]]

    (ii) Continuously integrated measurement of diluted CO and CO<INF>2 
meeting the minimum requirements and technical specifications contained 
in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (4) The NO<INF>X analytical system requires:
    (i) Grab sampling (see Sec. 90.420, and Figure 2 or Figure 3 in 
Appendix B of this subpart) and analytical capabilities (see 
Sec. 90.423, and Figure 4 in Appendix B of this subpart), or
    (ii) A continuously integrated measurement of diluted NO<INF>X 
meeting the minimum requirements and technical specifications contained 
in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (5) Since various configurations can produce equivalent results, 
exact conformance with these drawings is not required. Additional 
components such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps, and switches 
may be used to provide additional information and coordinate the 
functions of the component systems. Other components, such as snubbers, 
which are not needed to maintain accuracy on some systems, may be 
excluded if their exclusion is based upon good engineering judgment.
    (6) Other sampling and/or analytical systems may be used if shown to 
yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the 
Administrator.
    (b) Component description. The components necessary for exhaust 
0sampling must meet the following requirements:
    (1) Exhaust dilution system. The PDP-CVS must conform to all of the 
requirements listed for the exhaust gas PDP-CVS in Sec. 90.420 of this 
chapter. The CFV-CVS must conform to all of the requirements listed for 
the exhaust gas CFV-CVS in Sec. 90.420 of this chapter. In addition, the 
CVS must conform to the following requirements:
    (i) The flow capacity of the CVS must be sufficient to maintain the 
diluted exhaust stream in the dilution system at a temperature of 
190 deg. C or less at the sampling zone for hydrocarbon measurement and 
as required to prevent condensation at any point in the dilution system. 
Gaseous emission samples may be taken directly from this sampling point.
    (ii) For the CFV-CVS, either a heat exchanger or electronic flow 
compensation is required (see Figure 3 in Appendix B of this subpart).
    (iii) For the CFV-CVS when a heat exchanger is used, the gas mixture 
temperature, measured at a point immediately ahead of the critical flow 
venturi, must be within <plus-minus>11 deg. C of the average operating 
temperature observed during the test with the simultaneous requirement 
that condensation does not occur. The temperature measuring system 
(sensors and readout) must have an accuracy and precision of 
<plus-minus>2 deg. C. For systems utilizing a flow compensator to 
maintain proportional flow, the requirement for maintaining constant 
temperature is not necessary.
    (2) Continuous HC measurement system. (i) The continuous HC sample 
system (as shown in Figure 2 or 3 in Appendix B of this subpart) uses an 
``overflow'' zero and span system. In this type of system, excess zero 
or span gas spills out of the probe when zero and span checks of the 
analyzer are made.
    (ii) No other analyzers may draw a sample from the continuous HC 
sample probe, line, or system, unless a common sample pump is used for 
all analyzers and the sample line system design reflects good 
engineering practice.
    (iii) The overflow gas flow rates into the sample line must be at 
least 105 percent of the sample system flow rate.
    (iv) The overflow gases must enter the sample line as close as 
practical to the outside surface of the CVS duct or dilution system.
    (v) The continuous HC sampling system consists of a probe (which for 
a HFID analyzer must raise the sample to the specified temperature) and, 
where used, a sample transfer system (which for a HFID must maintain the 
specified temperature). The HFID continuous hydrocarbon sampling system 
(exclusive of the probe) must:
    (A) Maintain a wall temperature of 190 deg. C <plus-minus>11 deg. C 
as measured at every separately controlled heated component (that is, 
filters, heated line sections), using permanent thermocouples located at 
each of the separate components.
    (B) Have a wall temperature of 190 deg. C <plus-minus>11 deg. C over 
its entire length. The temperature of the system is demonstrated by 
profiling the thermal characteristics of the system where possible at

[[Page 191]]

initial installation and after any major maintenance performed on the 
system. The profiling is to be accomplished using the insertion 
thermocouple probing technique. The system temperature must be monitored 
continuously during testing at the locations and temperature described 
in Sec. 90.421(b)(2).
    (C) Maintain a gas temperature of 190 deg. C <plus-minus>11 deg. C 
immediately before the heated filter and HFID. Determine these gas 
temperatures by a temperature sensor located immediately upstream of 
each component.
    (vi) The continuous hydrocarbon sampling probe:
    (A) Is defined as the first 25.4 to 76.2 cm of the continuous 
hydrocarbon sampling system.
    (B) Has a 0.483 cm minimum inside diameter.
    (C) Is installed in the dilution system at a point where the 
dilution air and exhaust are well mixed and provide a homogenous 
mixture.
    (D) Is sufficiently distant (radially) from other probes and the 
system wall so as to be free from the influence of any wakes or eddies.
    (E) For a continuous HFID sample probe, the probe must increases the 
gas stream temperature to 190 deg. C <plus-minus>11 deg. C at the exit 
of the probe. Demonstrate the ability of the probe to accomplish this 
using the insertion thermocouple technique at initial installation and 
after any major maintenance. Demonstrate compliance with the temperature 
specification by continuously recording during each test the temperature 
of either the gas stream or the wall of the sample probe at its 
terminus.
    (vii) The response time of the continuous measurement system must be 
taken into account when logging test data.
    (3) Sample Mixing. (i) Configure the dilution system to ensure a 
well mixed, homogeneous sample prior to the sampling probe(s).
    (ii) Make the temperature of the diluted exhaust stream inside the 
dilution system sufficient to prevent water condensation.
    (iii) Direct the engine exhaust downstream at the point where it is 
introduced into the dilution system.
    (4) Continuously integrated NO<INF>X, CO, and CO<INF>2 measurement 
systems.
    (i) Sample probe requirements:
    (A) The sample probe for continously intergrated NO<INF>X, CO, and 
CO<INF>2 must be in the same plane as the continuous HC probe, but 
sufficiently distant (radially) from other probes and the tunnel wall so 
as to be free from the influences of any wakes or eddies.
    (B) The sample probe for continously intergrated NO<INF>X, CO, and 
CO<INF>2 must be heated and insulated over the entire length, to prevent 
water condensation, to a minimum temperature of 55 deg. C. Sample gas 
temperature immediately before the first filter in the system must be at 
least 55 deg. C.
    (ii) Conform to the continuous NO<INF>X, CO, or CO<INF>2 sampling 
and analysis system to the specifications of part 86, subpart D of this 
chapter with the following exceptions and revisions:
    (A) Heat the system components requiring heating only to prevent 
water condensation, the minimum component temperature is 55 deg. C.
    (B) Coordinate analysis system response time with CVS flow 
fluctuations and sampling time/test cycle offsets, if necessary.
    (C) Use only analytical gases conforming to the specifications of 
Sec. 90.312 of this subpart for calibration, zero and span checks.
    (D) Use a calibration curve conforming to Sec. 90.321 for CO and 
CO<INF>2 and Sec. 90.318 for NO<INF>X for any range on a linear analyzer 
below 155 ppm.
    (iii) Convert the chart deflections or voltage output of analyzers 
with non-linear calibration curves to concentration values by the 
calibration curve(s) specified in Sec. 90.321 of this chapter before 
flow correction (if used) and subsequent integration takes place.


<R05>
Sec. 90.422  Background sample.

    (a) Background samples are produced by drawing a sample of the 
dilution air during the exhaust collection phase of each test cycle 
mode.
    (1) An individual background sample may be produced and analyzed for 
each mode. Hence, a unique background value will be used for the 
emission calculations for each mode.
    (2) Alternatively, a single background sample may be produced by 
drawing a sample during the collection phase of each test cycle mode. 
Hence, a

[[Page 192]]

single cumulative background value will be used for the emission 
calculations for each mode.
    (b) For analysis of the individual sample described in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, a single value representing the average chart 
deflection over a 10-second stabilized period must be stored. All 
readings taken during the data logging period must be stable within 
<plus-minus> one percent of full scale.
    (c) Measure HC, CO, CO<INF>2, and NO<INF>X exhaust and background 
concentrations in the sample bag(s) with approximately the same flow 
rates and pressures used during calibration.


<R05>
Sec. 90.423  Exhaust gas analytical system; CVS grab sample.

    (a) Schematic drawings. Figure 4 in Appendix B of this subpart is a 
schematic drawing of the exhaust gas analytical systems used for 
analyzing CVS grab ``bag'' samples from spark-ignition engines. Since 
various configurations can produce accurate results, exact conformance 
with the drawing is not required. Additional components such as 
instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps and switches may be used to 
provide additional information and coordinate the functions of the 
component systems. Other components such as snubbers, which are not 
needed to maintain accuracy in some systems, may be excluded if their 
exclusion is based upon good engineering judgment.
    (b) Major component description. The analytical system, Figure 4 in 
Appendix B of this subpart, consists of a flame ionization detector 
(FID) or a heated flame ionization detector (HFID) for the measurement 
of hydrocarbons, non-dispersive infrared analyzers (NDIR) for the 
measurement of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and a 
chemiluminescence detector (CLD) (or heated CLD (HCLD)) for the 
measurement of oxides of nitrogen. The exhaust gas analytical system 
must conform to the following requirements:
    (1) The CLD (or HCLD) requires that the nitrogen dioxide present in 
the sample be converted to nitric oxide before analysis. Other types of 
analyzers may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if 
approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (2) If CO instruments are used which are essentially free of 
CO<INF>2 and water vapor interference, the use of the conditioning 
column may be deleted. (See Sec. 90.317 and Sec. 90.320.)
    (3) A CO instrument is considered to be essentially free of CO<INF>2 
and water vapor interference if its response to a mixture of three 
percent CO<INF>2 in N<INF>2, which has been bubbled through water at 
room temperature, produces an equivalent CO response, as measured on the 
most sensitive CO range, which is less than one percent of full-scale CO 
concentration on ranges above 300 ppm full scale or less than three ppm 
on ranges below 300 ppm full scale. (See Sec. 90.317.)
    (c) Alternate analytical systems. Analysis systems meeting the 
specifications and requirements of this subpart for dilute sampling may 
be used upon approval of the Administrator.
    (d) Other analyzers and equipment. Other types of analyzers and 
equipment may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if 
approved in advance by the Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 90.424  Dilute sampling procedures--CVS calibration.

    (a) The CVS is calibrated using an accurate flowmeter and restrictor 
valve.
    (1) The flowmeter calibration must be traceable to the National 
Institute for Standards and Testing (NIST) and serves as the reference 
value (NIST ``true'' value) for the CVS calibration. (Note: In no case 
should an upstream screen or other restriction which can affect the flow 
be used ahead of the flowmeter unless calibrated throughout the flow 
range with such a device.)
    (2) The CVS calibration procedures are designed for use of a 
``metering venturi'' type flowmeter. Large radius or American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers (ASME) flow nozzles are considered equivalent if 
traceable to NIST measurements. Other measurement systems may be used if 
shown to be equivalent under the test conditions in this section and 
traceable to NIST measurements.
    (3) Measurements of the various flowmeter parameters are recorded 
and related to flow through the CVS.

    (4) Procedures using both PDP-CVS and CFV-CVS are outlined in the 
following paragraphs. Other procedures yielding equivalent results may 
be used if approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (b) After the calibration curve has been obtained, verification of 
the entire system may be performed by injecting a known mass of gas into 
the system and comparing the mass indicated by the system to the true 
mass injected. An indicated error does not necessarily mean that the 
calibration is wrong, since other factors can influence the accuracy of 
the system (for example, analyzer calibration, leaks, or HC hangup). A 
verification procedure is found in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (c) PDP-CVS calibration. (1) The following calibration procedure 
outlines the equipment, the test configuration, and the various 
parameters which must be measured to establish the flow rate of the CVS 
pump.
    (i) All the parameters related to the pump are simultaneously 
measured with the parameters related to a flowmeter which is connected 
in series with the pump.
    (ii) The calculated flow rate, in cm<SUP>3/s, (at pump inlet 
absolute pressure and temperature) can then be plotted versus a 
correlation function which is the value of a specific combination of 
pump parameters.
    (iii) The linear equation which relates the pump flow and the 
correlation function is then determined.
    (iv) In the event that a CVS has a multiple speed drive, a 
calibration for each range used must be performed.
    (2) This calibration procedure is based on the measurement of the 
absolute values of the pump and flowmeter parameters that relate the 
flow rate at each point. Two conditions must be maintained to assure the 
accuracy and integrity of the calibration curve:
    (i) The temperature stability must be maintained during calibration. 
(Flowmeters are sensitive to inlet temperature oscillations; this can 
cause the data points to be scattered. Gradual changes in temperature 
are acceptable as long as they occur over a period of several minutes.)
    (ii) All connections and ducting between the flowmeter and the CVS 
pump must be absolutely void of leakage.
    (3) During an exhaust emission test the measurement of these same 
pump parameters enables the user to calculate the flow rate from the 
calibration equation.
    (4) Connect a system as shown in Figure 5 in Appendix B of this 
subpart. Although particular types of equipment are shown, other 
configurations that yield equivalent results may be used if approved in 
advance by the Administrator. For the system indicated, the following 
measurements and accuracies are required:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (5) After the system has been connected as shown in Figure 5 in 
Appendix B of this subpart, set the variable restrictor in the wide open 
position and run the CVS pump for 20 minutes. Record the calibration 
data.

[[Page 194]]

    (6) Reset the restrictor valve to a more restricted condition in an 
increment of pump inlet depression that will yield a minimum of six data 
points for the total calibration. Allow the system to stabilize for 
three minutes and repeat the data acquisition.
    (7) Data analysis:
    (i) The air flow rate, Q<INF>s, at each test point is calculated in 
standard cubic feet per minute 20 deg. C, 101.3 kPa from the flowmeter 
data using the manufacturer's prescribed method.
    (ii) The air flow rate is then converted to pump flow, V<INF>o, in 
cubic meter per revolution at absolute pump inlet temperature and 
pressure:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR03JY95.031

Where:

V<INF>o=Pump flow, m\3\/rev at T<INF>p, P<INF>p.
Q<INF>s=Meter air flow rate in standard cubic meters per minute, 
standard conditions are 20 deg. C, 101.3 kPa.
n=Pump speed in revolutions per minute.
T<INF>p=Absolute pump inlet temperature in Kelvin, =PTI+273 [ deg.K]
P<INF>p=Absolute pump inlet pressure, kPa.
      =P<INF>B-PPI

Where:

P<INF>B=barometric pressure, kPa
PPI=Pump inlet depression, kPa.

    (iii) The correlation function at each test point is then calculated 
from the calibration data:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR03JY95.032

Where:

X<INF>o=correlation function.
<greek-D>p=The pressure differential from pump inlet to pump outlet 
[kPa]
      <greek-D>p=P<INF>e-P<INF>p.

Where:

P<INF>e=Absolute pump outlet pressure [kPa], P<INF>e=P<INF>B+PPI

    (iv) A linear least squares fit is performed to generate the 
calibration equation which has the form:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR03JY95.033

Where:

    D<INF>o and M are the intercept and slope constants, respectively, 
describing the regression line.
    (8) A CVS system that has multiple speeds should be calibrated on 
each speed used. The calibration curves generated for the ranges will be 
approximately parallel and the intercept values, D<INF>o, will increase 
as the pump flow range decreases.
    (9) If the calibration has been performed carefully, the calculated 
values from the equation will be within <plus-minus> 0.50 percent of the 
measured value of V<INF>o. Values of M will vary from one pump to 
another, but values of D<INF>o for pumps of the same make, model, and 
range should agree within <plus-minus> three percent of each other. 
Calibrations should be performed at pump start-up and after major 
maintenance to assure the stability of the pump slip rate. Analysis of 
mass injection data will also reflect pump slip stability.
    (d) CFV-CVS calibration. (1) Calibration of the CFV is based upon 
the flow equation for a critical venturi. Gas flow is a function of 
inlet pressure and temperature:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR03JY95.034

Where:

Q<INF>s=flow rate [m\3\/min.]
K<INF>v=calibration coefficient
P=absolute pressure [kPa]
T=absolute temperature [ deg.K]

    The calibration procedure described in paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section establishes the value of the calibration coefficient at measured 
values of pressure, temperature, and air flow.
    (2) The manufacturer's recommended procedure must be followed for 
calibrating electronic portions of the CFV.
    (3) Measurements necessary for flow calibration are as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (4) Set up equipment as shown in Figure 6 in Appendix B of this 
subpart and eliminate leaks. (Leaks between the flow measuring devices 
and the critical flow venturi will seriously affect the accuracy of the 
calibration.)
    (5) Set the variable flow restrictor to the open position, start the 
blower, and allow the system to stabilize. Record data from all 
instruments.
    (6) Vary the flow restrictor and make at least eight readings across 
the critical flow range of the venturi.
    (7) Data analysis. The data recorded during the calibration are to 
be used in the following calculations:
    (i) Calculate the air flow rate (designated as Q<INF>s) at each test 
point in standard cubic feet per minute from the flow meter data using 
the manufacturer's prescribed method.
    (ii) Calculate values of the calibration coefficient for each test 
point:

Where:

Q<INF>s=Flow rate in standard cubic meters per minute, at
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR03JY95.035

the standard conditions of 20 deg. C, 101.3 kPa.
T<INF>v=Temperature at venturi inlet,  deg.K.
P<INF>v=Pressure at venturi inlet, kPa=P<INF>B-P<INF>PI

Where:

P<INF>PI=Venturi inlet pressure depression, kPa.

    (iii) Plot K<INF>v as a function of venturi inlet pressure. For 
choked flow, K<INF>v will have a relatively constant value. As pressure 
decreases (vacuum increases), the venturi becomes unchoked and K<INF>v 
decreases. (See Figure 7 in Appendix B to Subpart D.)
    (iv) For a minimum of eight points in the critical region, calculate 
an average K<INF>v and the standard deviation.
    (v) If the standard deviation exceeds 0.3 percent of the average 
K<INF>v , take corrective action.
    (e) CVS system verification. The following ``gravimetric'' technique 
may be used to verify that the CVS and analytical instruments can 
accurately measure a mass of gas that has been injected into the system. 
(Verification can also be accomplished by constant flow metering using 
critical flow orifice devices.)
    (1) Obtain a small cylinder that has been charged with 99.5 percent 
or greater propane or carbon monoxide gas (CAUTION--carbon monoxide is 
poisonous).
    (2) Determine a reference cylinder weight to the nearest 0.01 grams.
    (3) Operate the CVS in the normal manner and release a quantity of 
pure propane into the system during the sampling period (approximately 
five minutes).
    (4) The calculations are performed in the normal way except in the 
case of propane. The density of propane (0.6109 kg/m\3\/carbon atom) is 
used in place of the density of exhaust hydrocarbons.
    (5) The gravimetric mass is subtracted from the CVS measured mass 
and then divided by the gravimetric mass to determine the percent 
accuracy of the system.
    (6) Good engineering practice requires that the cause for any 
discrepancy greater than <plus-minus> two percent must be found and 
corrected.

    (b) The mass flow rate, W<INF>i in g/hr, of an emission for mode i 
is determined from the following equations:

C<INF>D CO2=Concentration of CO<INF>2 in the dilute sample [ppm]

    (e) The humidity correction factor K<INF>H is an adjustment made to 
the measured NO<INF>X. This corrects for the sensitivity that a spark-
ignition engine has to the humidity of its combustion air. The following 
formula is used to determine K<INF>H for NO<INF>X calculations:

Sec. 90.427  Catalyst thermal stress resistance evaluation.

    (a) The purpose of the evaluation procedure specified in this 
section is to determine the effect of thermal stress on catalyst 
conversion efficiency. The thermal stress is imposed on the test 
catalyst by exposing it to quiescent heated air in an oven. The 
evaluation of the effect of such stress on catalyst performance is based 
on the resultant degradation of the efficiency with which the 
conversions of specific pollutants are promoted. The application of this 
evaluation procedure involves the several steps that are described in 
the following paragraphs.
    (b) Determination of initial conversion efficiency. (1) A synthetic 
exhaust gas mixture having the composition specified in Sec. 90.329 is 
heated to a temperature of 450 deg. C <plus-minus> 5 deg. C and passed 
through the new test catalyst or, optionally, a test catalyst that has 
been exposed to temperatures less than or equal to 500 deg. C for less 
than or equal to two hours, under flow conditions that are 
representative of anticipated in-use conditions.
    (2) The concentration of each pollutant of interest, that is, 
hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, or oxides of nitrogen, in the effluent of 
the catalyst is determined by means of the instrumentation that is 
specified for exhaust gas analysis in subpart D of this part.
    (3) The conversion efficiency for each pollutant is determined by:
    (i) Subtracting the effluent concentration from the initial 
concentration;
    (ii) Dividing this result by the initial concentration; and
    (iii) Multiplying this result by 100 percent.
    (c) Imposition of thermal stress. (1) The catalyst is placed in an 
oven that has been pre-heated to 1000 deg. C and the temperature of the 
air in the oven is maintained at 1000 deg. C <plus-minus> 10 deg. C for 
six hours.
    (2) The catalyst is removed from the oven and allowed to cool to 
room temperature.
    (d) Determination of final conversion efficiency. The steps listed 
in paragraph (b) of this section are repeated.
    (e) Determination of conversion efficiency degradation.
    (1) The final conversion efficiency determined in paragraph (c) of 
this section is subtracted from the initial conversion efficiency 
determined in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) This result is divided by the initial conversion efficiency.
    (3) This result is multiplied by 100 percent.
    (f) Determination of compliance with degradation limit. The percent 
degradation determined in paragraph (e) of this section must not be 
greater than 20 percent.

<R04>
                Subpart F--Selective Enforcement Auditing


<R05>
Sec. 90.501  Applicability.

    The requirements of subpart F shall be applicable to all nonroad 
engines and vehicles subject to the provisions of subpart A of part 90.


<R05>
Sec. 90.502  Definitions.

    The definitions in subpart A of this part apply to this subpart. The 
following definitions shall also apply to this subpart.
    Acceptable quality level (AQL) means the maximum percentage of 
failing engines that can be considered a satisfactory process average 
for sampling inspections.
    Configuration means any subclassification of an engine family which 
can be described on the basis of gross power, emission control system, 
governed speed, fuel system, engine calibration, and other parameters as 
designated by the Administrator.
    Inspection criteria means the pass and fail numbers associated with 
a particular sampling plan.
    Test engine means an engine in a test sample.
    Test sample means the collection of engines selected from the 
population of an engine family for emission testing.


<R05>
Sec. 90.503  Test orders.

    (a) The Administrator shall require any testing under this subpart 
by means of a test order addressed to the manufacturer.
    (b) The test order will be signed by the Assistant Administrator for 
Air and Radiation or his or her designee. The test order will be 
delivered in person by an EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized 
representative to a company representative or sent by registered mail, 
return receipt requested, to the manufacturer's representative who 
signed the application for certification submitted by the manufacturer, 
pursuant to the requirements of the applicable section of subpart B of 
this part. Upon receipt of a test order, the manufacturer shall comply 
with all of the provisions of this subpart and instructions in the test 
order.
    (c) Information included in test order. (1) The test order will 
specify the engine family to be selected for testing, the manufacturer's 
engine assembly plant or associated storage facility or port facility 
(for imported engines) from which the engines must be selected, the time 
and location at which engines must be selected, and the procedure by 
which engines of the specified family must be selected. The test order 
may specify the configuration to be audited and/or the number of engines 
to be selected per day. Engine manufacturers will be required to select 
a minimum of four engines per day unless an alternate selection 
procedure is approved pursuant to Sec. 90.507(a), or unless total 
production of the specified configuration is less than four engines per 
day. If total production of the specified configuration is less than 
four engines per day, the manufacturer will select the actual number of 
engines produced per day.
    (2) The test order may include alternate families to be selected for 
testing at the Administrator's discretion in the event that engines of 
the specified family are not available for testing because those engines 
are not being manufactured during the specified time, or are not being 
stored at the specified assembly plant, associated storage facilities or 
port of entry.
    (3) If the specified family is not being manufactured at a rate of 
at least two engines per day in the case of manufacturers specified in 
Sec. 90.508(g)(1), or one engine per day in the case of manufacturers 
specified in Sec. 90.508(g)(2), over the expected duration of the audit, 
the Assistant Administrator or his or her designated representative may 
select engines of the alternate family for testing.
    (4) In addition, the test order may include other directions or 
information essential to the administration of the required testing.
    (d) A manufacturer may submit a list of engine families and the 
corresponding assembly plants, associated storage facilities, or (in the 
case of imported engines) port facilities from which the manufacturer 
prefers to have engines selected for testing in response to a test 
order. In order that a manufacturer's preferred location be considered 
for inclusion in a test order for a particular engine family, the list 
must be

[[Page 208]]

submitted prior to issuance of the test order. Notwithstanding the fact 
that a manufacturer has submitted the list, the Administrator may order 
selection at other than a preferred location.
    (e) Upon receipt of a test order, a manufacturer shall proceed in 
accordance with the provisions of this subpart.
    (f)(1) During a given model year, the Administrator shall not issue 
to a manufacturer more Selective Enforcement Auditing (SEA) test orders 
than an annual limit determined by the following:
    (i) for manufacturers with a projected annual production of less 
than 100,000 engines bound for the United States market for that model 
year, the number is two;
    (ii) for manufacturers with a projected annual production of 100,000 
or more engines bound for the United States market for that model year, 
by dividing the manufacturer's total number of certified engine families 
by five and rounding to the nearest whole number, unless the number of 
engine families is less than eight, in which case the number is two.
    (2) If a manufacturer submits to EPA in writing prior to or during 
the model year a reliable sales projection update or adds engine 
families or deletes engine families from its production, that 
information will be used for recalculating the manufacturer's annual 
limit of SEA test orders.
    (3) Any SEA test order for which the family fails under Sec. 90.510 
or for which testing is not completed will not be counted against the 
annual limit.
    (4) When the annual limit has been met, the Administrator may issue 
additional test orders to test those families for which evidence exists 
indicating noncompliance. An SEA test order issued on this basis will 
include a statement as to the reason for its issuance.


<R05>
Sec. 90.504  Testing by the Administrator.

    (a) The Administrator may require by test order under Sec. 90.503 
that engines of a specified family be selected in a manner consistent 
with the requirements of Sec. 90.507 and submitted to the Administrator 
at the place designated for the purpose of conducting emission tests. 
These tests will be conducted in accordance with Sec. 90.508 to 
determine whether engines manufactured by the manufacturer conform with 
the regulations with respect to which the certificate of conformity was 
issued.
    (b) Designating official data. (1) Whenever the Administrator 
conducts a test on a test engine or the Administrator and manufacturer 
each conduct a test on the same test engine, the results of the 
Administrator's test will comprise the official data for that engine.
    (2) Whenever the manufacturer conducts all tests on a test engine, 
the manufacturer's test data will be accepted as the official data, 
provided that if the Administrator makes a determination based on 
testing conducted under paragraph (a) of this section that there is a 
substantial lack of agreement between the manufacturer's test results 
and the Administrator's test results, no manufacturer's test data from 
the manufacturer's test facility will be accepted for purposes of this 
subpart.
    (c) If testing conducted under paragraph (a) of this section is 
unacceptable under Sec. 90.503, the Administrator shall:
    (1) Notify the manufacturer in writing of the Administrator's 
determination that the test facility is inappropriate for conducting the 
tests required by this subpart and the reasons therefor; and
    (2) Reinstate any manufacturer's data upon a showing by the 
manufacturer that the data acquired under paragraph (a) of this section 
was erroneous and the manufacturer's data was correct.
    (d) The manufacturer may request in writing that the Administrator 
reconsider his or her determination in paragraph (b)(2) of this section 
based on data or information which indicates that changes have been made 
to the test facility and these changes have resolved the reasons for 
disqualification.


<R05>
Sec. 90.505  Maintenance of records; submittal of information.

    (a) The manufacturer of any new nonroad engine subject to any of the 
provisions of this subpart shall establish, maintain, and retain the

requiring the manufacturer to retain additional records or submit 
information not specifically required by this section.
    (e) The manufacturer shall address all reports, submissions, 
notifications, and requests for approvals made under this subpart to: 
Director, Manufacturers Operations Division, U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, 6405-J, 401 M Street S.W., Washington, D.C. 20460.


<R05>
Sec. 90.506  Right of entry and access.

    (a) To allow the Administrator to determine whether a manufacturer 
is complying with the provisions of this subpart, a test order is issued 
which authorizes EPA enforcement officers or their authorized 
representatives upon presentation of credentials to enter during 
operating hours any of the following places:
    (1) Any facility where any engine to be introduced into commerce, 
including ports of entry, or any emission-related component is 
manufactured, assembled, or stored;
    (2) Any facility where any tests conducted pursuant to a test order 
or any procedures or activities connected with these tests are or were 
performed;

[[Page 210]]

    (3) Any facility where any engine which is being tested, was tested, 
or will be tested is present; and
    (4) Any facility where any record or other document relating to any 
of the above is located.
    (b) Upon admission to any facility referred to in paragraph (a) of 
this section, EPA enforcement officers or EPA authorized representatives 
are authorized to perform the following inspection-related activities:
    (1) To inspect and monitor any aspects of engine assembly, storage, 
testing and other procedures, and the facilities in which these 
procedures are conducted;
    (2) To inspect and monitor any aspect of engine test procedures or 
activities, including, but not limited to, engine selection, 
preparation, service accumulation, emission test cycles, and maintenance 
and verification of test equipment calibration;
    (3) To inspect and make copies of any records or documents related 
to the assembly, storage, selection and testing of an engine in 
compliance with a test order; and
    (4) To inspect and photograph any part or aspect of any engine and 
any component used in the assembly thereof that is reasonably related to 
the purpose of the entry.
    (c) EPA enforcement officers or EPA authorized representatives are 
authorized to obtain reasonable assistance without cost from those in 
charge of a facility to help the officers perform any function listed in 
this subpart, and they are authorized to request the recipient of a test 
order to make arrangements with those in charge of a facility operated 
for the manufacturer's benefit to furnish reasonable assistance without 
cost to EPA, whether or not the recipient controls the facility.
    (1) Reasonable assistance includes, but is not limited to, clerical, 
copying, interpretation and translation services, the making available 
on an EPA enforcement officer's or EPA authorized representative's 
request of personnel of the facility being inspected during their 
working hours to inform the EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized 
representative of how the facility operates and to answer the officer's 
questions, and the performance on request of emission tests on any 
engine which is being, has been, or will be used for SEA testing.
    (2) A manufacturer may be compelled to cause the personal appearance 
of any employee at such a facility before an EPA enforcement officer or 
EPA authorized representative by written request for his or her 
appearance, signed by the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, 
served on the manufacturer. Any such employee who has been instructed by 
the manufacturer to appear will be entitled to be accompanied, 
represented, and advised by counsel.
    (d) EPA enforcement officers or EPA authorized representatives are 
authorized to seek a warrant or court order authorizing the EPA 
enforcement officers or EPA authorized representatives to conduct 
activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section, as 
appropriate, to execute the functions specified in this section. EPA 
enforcement officers or authorized representatives may proceed ex parte 
to obtain a warrant whether or not the EPA enforcement officers or EPA 
authorized representatives first attempted to seek permission of the 
recipient of the test order or the party in charge of the facilities in 
question to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized 
in this section.
    (e) A recipient of a test order shall permit an EPA enforcement 
officer(s) or EPA authorized representative(s) who presents a warrant or 
court order to conduct activities related to entry and access as 
authorized in this section and as described in the warrant or court 
order. The recipient shall also cause those in charge of its facility or 
a facility operated for its benefit to permit entry and access as 
authorized in this section pursuant to a warrant or court order whether 
or not the recipient controls the facility. In the absence of a warrant 
or court order, an EPA enforcement officer(s) or EPA authorized 
representative(s) may conduct activities related to entry and access as 
authorized in this section only upon the consent of the recipient of the 
test order or the party in charge of the facilities in question.
    (f) It is not a violation of this part or of the Clean Air Act for 
any person to

[[Page 211]]

refuse to permit an EPA enforcement officer(s) or an EPA authorized 
representative(s) to conduct activities related to entry and access as 
authorized in this section if the officer or representative appears 
without a warrant or court order.
    (g) A manufacturer is responsible for locating its foreign testing 
and manufacturing facilities in jurisdictions in which local foreign law 
does not prohibit an EPA enforcement officer(s) or an EPA authorized 
representative(s) from conducting the entry and access activities 
specified in this section. EPA will not attempt to make any inspections 
which it has been informed that local foreign law prohibits.


<R05>
Sec. 90.507  Sample selection.

    (a) Engines comprising a test sample will be selected at the 
location and in the manner specified in the test order. If a 
manufacturer determines that the test engines cannot be selected in the 
manner specified in the test order, an alternative selection procedure 
may be employed, provided the manufacturer requests approval of the 
alternative procedure prior to the start of test sample selection, and 
the Administrator approves the procedure.
    (b) The manufacturer shall assemble the test engines of the family 
selected for testing using its normal mass production process for 
engines to be distributed into commerce. If, between the time the 
manufacturer is notified of a test order and the time the manufacturer 
finishes selecting test engines, the manufacturer implements any 
change(s) in its production processes, including quality control, which 
may reasonably be expected to affect the emissions of the engines 
selected, then the manufacturer shall, during the audit, inform the 
Administrator of such changes. If the test engines are selected at a 
location where they do not have their operational and emission control 
systems installed, the test order will specify the manner and location 
for selection of components to complete assembly of the engines. The 
manufacturer shall assemble these components onto the test engines using 
normal assembly and quality control procedures as documented by the 
manufacturer.
    (c) No quality control, testing, or assembly procedures will be used 
on the test engine or any portion thereof, including parts and 
subassemblies, that have not been or will not be used during the 
production and assembly of all other engines of that family, unless the 
Administrator approves the modification in assembly procedures pursuant 
to paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) The test order may specify that an EPA enforcement officer(s) or 
authorized representative(s), rather than the manufacturer, select the 
test engines according to the method specified in the test order.
    (e) The order in which test engines are selected determines the 
order in which test results are to be used in applying the sampling plan 
in accordance with Sec. 90.510.
    (f) The manufacturer shall keep on hand all untested engines, if 
any, comprising the test sample until a pass or fail decision is reached 
in accordance with Sec. 90.510(e). The manufacturer may ship any tested 
engine which has not failed in accordance with Sec. 90.510(b). However, 
once the manufacturer ships any test engine, it relinquishes the 
prerogative to conduct retests as provided in Sec. 90.508(i).


<R05>
Sec. 90.508  Test procedures.

    (a) For nonroad engines subject to the provisions of this subpart, 
the prescribed test procedures are the appropriate small SI engine test 
procedures as described in subpart E of this part.
    (b)(1) The manufacturer shall not adjust, repair, prepare, or modify 
the engines selected for testing and shall not perform any emission 
tests on engines selected for testing pursuant to the test order unless 
this adjustment, repair, preparation, modification, and/or tests are 
documented in the manufacturer's engine assembly and inspection 
procedures and are actually performed or unless these adjustments and/or 
tests are required or permitted under this subpart or are approved in 
advance by the Administrator.
    (2) The Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any engine 
parameter which the Administrator has determined to be subject to 
adjustment for certification and Selective Enforcement Audit testing in 
accordance with

[[Page 212]]

Sec. 90.112(c), to any setting within the physically adjustable range of 
that parameter, as determined by the Administrator in accordance with 
Sec. 90.112(a), prior to the performance of any tests. However, if the 
idle speed parameter is one which the Administrator has determined to be 
subject to adjustment, the Administrator shall not adjust it to any 
setting which causes a lower engine idle speed than would have been 
possible within the physically adjustable range of the idle speed 
parameter if the manufacturer had accumulated 12 hours of service on the 
engine under paragraph (c) of this section, all other parameters being 
identically adjusted for the purpose of the comparison. The manufacturer 
may be requested to supply information needed to establish an alternate 
minimum idle speed. The Administrator, in making or specifying these 
adjustments, may consider the effect of the deviation from the 
manufacturer's recommended setting on emission performance 
characteristics as well as the likelihood that similar settings will 
occur on in-use engines. In determining likelihood, the Administrator 
may consider factors such as, but not limited to, the effect of the 
adjustment on engine performance characteristics and surveillance 
information from similar in-use engines.
    (c) Service Accumulation. Prior to performing exhaust emission 
testing on an SEA test engine, the manufacturer may accumulate on each 
engine a number of hours of service equal to the greater of 12 hours or 
the number of hours the manufacturer accumulated during certification on 
the emission data engine corresponding to the family specified in the 
test order.
    (1) Service accumulation must be performed in a manner using good 
engineering judgment to obtain emission results representative of normal 
production engines. This service accumulation must be consistent with 
the new engine break-in instructions contained in the applicable owner's 
manual.
    (2) The manufacturer shall accumulate service at a minimum rate of 
12 hours per engine during each 24-hour period, unless otherwise 
approved by the Administrator.
    (i) The first 24 hour period for service shall begin as soon as 
authorized checks, inspections, and preparations are completed on each 
engine.
    (ii) The minimum service or mileage accumulation rate does not apply 
on weekends or holidays.
    (iii) If the manufacturer's service or target is less than the 
minimum rate specified (12 hours per day), then the minimum daily 
accumulation rate shall be equal to the manufacturer's service target.
    (3) Service accumulation shall be completed on a sufficient number 
of test engines during consecutive 24-hour periods to assure that the 
number of engines tested per day fulfills the requirements of paragraphs 
(g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section.
    (d) The manufacturer shall not perform any maintenance on test 
engines after selection for testing, nor shall the Administrator allow 
deletion of any engine from the test sequence, unless requested by the 
manufacturer and approved by the Administrator before any engine 
maintenance or deletion.
    (e) The manufacturer shall expeditiously ship test engines from the 
point of selection to the test facility. If the test facility is not 
located at or in close proximity to the point of selection, the 
manufacturer shall assure that test engines arrive at the test facility 
within 24 hours of selection, except that the Administrator may approve 
more time for shipment based upon a request by the manufacturer 
accompanied by a satisfactory justification.
    (f) If an engine cannot complete the service accumulation or an 
emission test because of a malfunction, the manufacturer may request 
that the Administrator authorize either the repair of that engine or its 
deletion from the test sequence.
    (g) Whenever a manufacturer conducts testing pursuant to a test 
order issued under this subpart, the manufacturer shall notify the 
Administrator within one working day of receipt of the test order as to 
which test facility will be used to comply with the test order. If no 
test cells are available at a desired facility, the manufacturer must 
provide alternate testing capability satisfactory to the Administrator.
    (1) A manufacturer with projected nonroad engine sales for the 
United

[[Page 213]]

States market for the applicable year of 7,500 or greater shall complete 
emission testing at a minimum rate of two engines per 24-hour period, 
including each voided test.
    (2) A manufacturer with projected nonroad engine sales for the 
United States market for the applicable year of less than 7,500 shall 
complete emission testing at a minimum rate of one engine per 24-hour 
period, including each voided test.
    (3) The Administrator may approve a lower daily rate of emission 
testing based upon a request by a manufacturer accompanied by a 
satisfactory justification.
    (h) The manufacturer shall perform test engine selection, shipping, 
preparation, service accumulation, and testing in such a manner as to 
assure that the audit is performed in an expeditious manner.
    (i) Retesting. (1) The manufacturer may retest any engines tested 
during a Selective Enforcement Audit once a fail decision for the audit 
has been reached in accordance with Sec. 90.510(e).
    (2) The Administrator may approve retesting at other times based 
upon a request by the manufacturer accompanied by a satisfactory 
justification.
    (3) The manufacturer may retest each engine a total of three times. 
The manufacturer shall test each engine or vehicle the same number of 
times. The manufacturer may accumulate additional service before 
conducting a retest, subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (j) A manufacturer may test engines with the test procedure 
specified in subpart E of this part to demonstrate compliance with the 
exhaust emission standards; however, if alternate procedures were used 
in certification pursuant to Sec. 90.120, then those alternate 
procedures shall be used.


<R05>
Sec. 90.509  Calculation and reporting of test results.

    (a) Initial test results are calculated following the applicable 
test procedure specified in paragraph (a) of Sec. 90.508. The 
manufacturer shall round these results, in accordance with ASTM E29-93a, 
to the number of decimal places contained in the applicable emission 
standard expressed to one additional significant figure. ASTM E29-93a 
has been incorporated by reference. See Sec. 90.7.
    (b) Final test results are calculated by summing the initial test 
results derived in paragraph (a) of this section for each test engine, 
dividing by the number of tests conducted on the engine, and rounding in 
accordance with ASTM E29-93a to the same number of decimal places 
contained in the applicable standard expressed to one additional 
significant figure.
    (c) Within five working days after completion of testing of all 
engines pursuant to a test order, the manufacturer shall submit to the 
Administrator a report which includes the following information:
    (1) The location and description of the manufacturer's exhaust 
emission test facilities which were utilized to conduct testing reported 
pursuant to this section;
    (2) The applicable standards or compliance levels against which the 
engines were tested;
    (3) A description of the engine and its associated emission-related 
component selection method used;
    (4) For each test conducted;
    (i) Test engine description, including:
    (A) Configuration and engine family identification;
    (B) Year, make and build date;
    (C) Engine identification number; and
    (D) Number of hours of service accumulated on engine prior to 
testing;
    (ii) Location where service accumulation was conducted and 
description of accumulation procedure and schedule;
    (iii) Test number, date, test procedure used, initial test results 
before and after rounding and final test results for all exhaust 
emission tests, whether valid or invalid, and the reason for 
invalidation, if applicable;
    (iv) A complete description of any modification, repair, 
preparation, maintenance, and/or testing which was performed on the test 
engine and has not been reported pursuant to any other paragraph of this 
subpart and will not be performed on all other production engines;
    (v) Where an engine was deleted from the test sequence by 
authorization of

[[Page 214]]

the Administrator, the reason for the deletion;
    (vi) Any other information the Administrator may request relevant to 
the determination as to whether the new engines being manufactured by 
the manufacturer do in fact conform with the regulations with respect to 
which the certificate of conformity was issued; and
    (5) The following statement and endorsement:
    This report is submitted pursuant to Sections 213 and 208 of the 
Clean Air Act. This Selective Enforcement Audit was conducted in 
complete conformance with all applicable regulations under 40 CFR Part 
90 et seq. and the conditions of the test order. No emission-related 
changes to production processes or quality control procedures for the 
engine family tested have been made between receipt of the test order 
and conclusion of the audit. All data and information reported herein 
is, to the best of (Company Name) knowledge, true and accurate. I am 
aware of the penalties associated with violations of the Clean Air Act 
and the regulations thereunder. (Authorized Company Representative.)


<R05>
Sec. 90.510  Compliance with acceptable quality level and passing and failing criteria for selective enforcement audits.

    (a) The prescribed acceptable quality level is 40 percent.
    (b) A failed engine is one whose final test results pursuant to 
Sec. 90.509(b), for one or more of the applicable pollutants, exceed the 
applicable emission standard.
    (c) The manufacturer shall test engines comprising the test sample 
until a pass decision is reached for all pollutants or a fail decision 
is reached for one pollutant. A pass decision is reached when the 
cumulative number of failed engines, as defined in paragraph (b) of this 
section, for each pollutant is less than or equal to the pass decision 
number, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, appropriate to the 
cumulative number of engines tested. A fail decision is reached when the 
cumulative number of failed engines for one or more pollutants is 
greater than or equal to the fail decision number, as defined in 
paragraph (d) of this section, appropriate to the cumulative number of 
engines tested.
    (d) The pass and fail decision numbers associated with the 
cumulative number of engines tested are determined by using the tables 
in Appendix A to this subpart, ``Sampling Plans for Selective 
Enforcement Auditing of Small Nonroad Engines,'' appropriate to the 
projected sales as made by the manufacturer in its report to EPA under 
Sec. 90.505(c)(1). In the tables in Appendix A to this subpart, sampling 
plan ``stage'' refers to the cumulative number of engines tested. Once a 
pass or fail decision has been made for a particular pollutant, the 
number of engines with final test results exceeding the emission 
standard for that pollutant shall not be considered any further for the 
purposes of the audit.
    (e) Passing or failing of an SEA occurs when the decision is made on 
the last engine test required to make a decision under paragraph (c) of 
this section.
    (f) The Administrator may terminate testing earlier than required in 
paragraph (c) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 90.511  Suspension and revocation of certificates of conformity.

    (a) The certificate of conformity is suspended with respect to any 
engine failing pursuant to Sec. 90.510(b) effective from the time that 
testing of that engine is completed.
    (b) The Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity for 
a family which does not pass an SEA, pursuant to paragraph 
Sec. 90.510(c), based on the first test or all tests conducted on each 
engine. This suspension will not occur before ten days after failure of 
the audit.
    (c) If the results of testing pursuant to these regulations indicate 
that engines of a particular family produced at one plant of a 
manufacturer do not conform to the regulations with respect to which the 
certificate of conformity was issued, the Administrator may suspend the 
certificate of conformity with respect to that family for engines 
manufactured by the manufacturer at all other plants.
    (d) Notwithstanding the fact that engines described in the 
application may

[[Page 215]]

be covered by a certificate of conformity, the Administrator may suspend 
such certificate in whole or in part if the Administrator finds any one 
of the following infractions to be substantial:
    (1) The manufacturer refuses to comply with the provisions of a test 
order issued by the Administrator under Sec. 90.503.
    (2) The manufacturer refuses to comply with any of the requirements 
of this subpart.
    (3) The manufacturer submits false or incomplete information in any 
report or information provided to the Administrator under this subpart.
    (4) The manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data submitted 
under this subpart.
    (5) An EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative is 
denied the opportunity to conduct activities related to entry and access 
as authorized in this subpart and a warrant or court order is presented 
to the manufacturer or the party in charge of a facility in question.
    (6) An EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative is 
unable to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized 
in Sec. 90.506 because a manufacturer has located a facility in a 
foreign jurisdiction where local law prohibits those activities.
    (e) The Administrator shall notify the manufacturer in writing of 
any suspension or revocation of a certificate of conformity in whole or 
in part, except that the certificate is immediately suspended with 
respect to any failed engines as provided for in paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (f) The Administrator may revoke a certificate of conformity for a 
family when the certificate has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) 
or (c) of this section if the proposed remedy for the nonconformity, as 
reported by the manufacturer to the Administrator, is one requiring a 
design change or changes to the engine and/or emission control system as 
described in the application for certification of the affected family.
    (g) Once a certificate has been suspended for a failed engine, as 
provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the manufacturer shall 
take the following actions:
    (1) Before the certificate is reinstated for that failed engine;
    (i) Remedy the nonconformity; and
    (ii) Demonstrate that the engine conforms to applicable standards by 
retesting the engine in accordance with these regulations.
    (2) Submit a written report to the Administrator, after successful 
completion of testing on the failed engine, which contains a description 
of the remedy and test results for each engine in addition to other 
information that may be required by this regulation.
    (h) Once a certificate for a failed family has been suspended 
pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the manufacturer shall 
take the following actions before the Administrator will consider 
reinstating the certificate:
    (1) Submit a written report to the Administrator which identifies 
the reason for the noncompliance of the engines, describes the proposed 
remedy, including a description of any proposed quality control and/or 
quality assurance measures to be taken by the manufacturer to prevent 
future occurrences of the problem, and states the date on which the 
remedies will be implemented.
    (2) Demonstrate that the engine family for which the certificate of 
conformity has been suspended does in fact comply with these regulations 
by testing engines selected from normal production runs of that engine 
family, at the plant(s), port facility(ies) or associated storage 
facility(ies) specified by the Administrator, in accordance with the 
conditions specified in the initial test order. If the manufacturer 
elects to continue testing individual engines after suspension of a 
certificate, the certificate is reinstated for an engine actually 
determined to be in conformance with the applicable standards through 
testing in accordance with the applicable test procedures, provided that 
the Administrator has not revoked the certificate pursuant to paragraph 
(f) of this section.
    (i) Once the certificate has been revoked for a family and the 
manufacturer desires to continue introduction into commerce of a 
modified version of that family, the following actions shall

[[Page 216]]

be taken before the Administrator may consider issuing a certificate for 
that modified family:
    (1) If the Administrator determines that the proposed change(s) in 
engine design may have an effect on emission performance deterioration, 
the Administrator shall notify the manufacturer, within five working 
days after receipt of the report in paragraph (f) of this section, 
whether subsequent testing under this subpart will be sufficient to 
evaluate the proposed change or changes or whether additional testing 
will be required; and
    (2) After implementing the change or changes intended to remedy the 
nonconformity, the manufacturer shall demonstrate that the modified 
engine family does in fact conform with these regulations by testing 
engines selected from normal production runs of that modified engine 
family in accordance with the conditions specified in the initial test 
order. If the subsequent audit results in passing of the audit, the 
Administrator shall reissue the certificate or issue a new certificate, 
as the case may be, to include that family, provided that the 
manufacturer has satisfied the testing requirements of paragraph (i)(1) 
of this section. If the subsequent audit is failed, the revocation 
remains in effect. Any design change approvals under this subpart are 
limited to the family affected by the test order.
    (j) At any time subsequent to an initial suspension of a certificate 
of conformity for a test engine pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section, but not later than 15 days or such other period as may be 
allowed by the Administrator after notification of the Administrator's 
decision to suspend or revoke a certificate of conformity in whole or in 
part pursuant to paragraphs (b), (c), or (f) of this section, a 
manufacturer may request a hearing as to whether the tests have been 
properly conducted or any sampling methods have been properly applied.
    (k) Any suspension of a certificate of conformity under paragraph 
(d) of this section shall:
    (1) Be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered 
an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with Secs. 90.512, 
90.513, and 90.514 and
    (2) Not apply to engines no longer in the possession of the 
manufacturer.
    (l) After the Administrator suspends or revokes a certificate of 
conformity pursuant to this section and prior to the commencement of a 
hearing under Sec. 90.512, if the manufacturer demonstrates to the 
Administrator's satisfaction that the decision to suspend, revoke, or 
void the certificate was based on erroneous information, the 
Administrator shall reinstate the certificate.
    (m) To permit a manufacturer to avoid storing non-test engines when 
conducting an audit of a family subsequent to a failure of an SEA and 
while reauditing the failed family it may request that the Administrator 
conditionally reinstate the certificate for that family. The 
Administrator may reinstate the certificate subject to the condition 
that the manufacturer commits to recall all engines of that family 
produced from the time the certificate is conditionally reinstated if 
the family fails the subsequent audit at the level of the standard and 
to remedy any nonconformity at no expense to the owner.


<R05>
Sec. 90.512  Request for public hearing.

    (a) If the manufacturer disagrees with the Administrator's decision 
to suspend, revoke or void a certificate or disputes the basis for an 
automatic suspension pursuant to Sec. 90.511(a), the manufacturer may 
request a public hearing.
    (b) The manufacturer's request shall be filed with the Administrator 
not later than 15 days after the Administrator's notification of his or 
her decision to suspend or revoke, unless otherwise specified by the 
Administrator. The manufacturer shall simultaneously serve two copies of 
this request upon the Director of the Manufacturers Operations Division 
and file two copies with the Hearing Clerk of the Agency. Failure of the 
manufacturer to request a hearing within the time provided constitutes a 
waiver of the right to a hearing. Subsequent to the expiration of the 
period for requesting a hearing as of right, the Administrator may, in 
his or her discretion and for good cause

[[Page 217]]

shown, grant the manufacturer a hearing to contest the suspension or 
revocation.
    (c) A manufacturer shall include in the request for a public 
hearing:
    (1) A statement as to which engine configuration(s) within a family 
is to be the subject of the hearing;
    (2) A concise statement of the issues to be raised by the 
manufacturer at the hearing, except that in the case of the hearing 
requested under Sec. 90.511(j), the hearing is restricted to the 
following issues:
    (i) Whether tests have been properly conducted (specifically, 
whether the tests were conducted in accordance with applicable 
regulations under this part and whether test equipment was properly 
calibrated and functioning);
    (ii) Whether sampling plans have been properly applied 
(specifically, whether sampling procedures specified in Appendix A of 
this subpart were followed and whether there exists a basis for 
distinguishing engines produced at plants other than the one from which 
engines were selected for testing which would invalidate the 
Administrator's decision under Sec. 90.511(c));
    (3) A statement specifying reasons why the manufacturer believes it 
will prevail on the merits of each of the issues raised; and
    (4) A summary of the evidence which supports the manufacturer's 
position on each of the issues raised.
    (d) A copy of all requests for public hearings will be kept on file 
in the Office of the Hearing Clerk and will be made available to the 
public during Agency business hours.

    (b) EPA will not require a U.S. Customs Service bond for a 
nonconforming engine which is imported under Sec. 90.611.


<R05>
Sec. 90.612  Exemptions and exclusions.

    (a) Individuals shall be eligible for importing engines into the 
United States under the provisions of this section, unless otherwise 
specified.
    (b) Notwithstanding other requirements of this subpart, an engine 
entitled to one of the temporary exemptions of this paragraph may be 
conditionally admitted into the United States if prior written approval 
for the conditional admission is obtained from the Administrator. 
Conditional admission is to be under U.S. Customs Service bond. The 
Administrator may request that the U.S. Customs Service require a 
specific bond amount to ensure compliance with the requirements of the 
Act and this subpart. A written request for approval from the 
Administrator is to contain the identification required in 
Sec. 90.604(c) and information that demonstrates that the importer is 
entitled to the exemption. Noncompliance with provisions of this section 
may result in the forfeiture of the total amount of the bond or 
exportation of the engine. The following temporary exemptions are 
permitted by this paragraph:
    (1) Exemption for repairs or alterations. Upon written approval by 
EPA, an owner of engines may conditionally import under bond such 
engines solely for purpose of repair(s) or alteration(s). The engines 
may not be operated in the United States other than for the sole purpose 
of repair or alteration. They may not be sold or leased in the United 
States and are to be exported upon completion of the repair(s) or 
alteration(s).
    (2) Testing exemption. A test engine may be conditionally imported 
by a person subject to the requirements of Sec. 90.905. A test engine 
may be operated in the United States provided that the operation is an 
integral part of the test. This exemption is limited to a period not 
exceeding one year from the date of importation unless a request is made 
by the appropriate importer concerning the engine in accordance with 
Sec. 90.905(f) for a subsequent one-year period.
    (3) Display exemptions.
    (i) An engine intended solely for display may be conditionally 
imported subject to the requirements of Sec. 90.907.
    (ii) A display engine may be imported by any person for purposes 
related to a business or the public interest. Such purposes do not 
include collections normally inaccessible or unavailable to the public 
on a daily basis, display of an engine at a dealership, private use, or 
other purpose that the Administrator determines is not appropriate for 
display exemptions. A display engine may not be sold in the United 
States and may not be operated in the United States except for the 
operation incident and necessary to the display purpose.
    (iii) A temporary display exemption will be granted for 12 months 
(one year) or for the duration of the display purpose, whichever is 
shorter. Two extensions of up to 12 months (one year) each are available 
upon approval by the Administrator. In no circumstances, however, may 
the total period of exemption exceed 36 months (three years).
    (c) Notwithstanding any other requirement of this subpart, an engine 
may be finally admitted into the United States under this paragraph if 
prior written approval for such final admission is obtained from the 
Administrator. Conditional admission of these engines under this subpart 
is not permitted for the purpose of obtaining such written approval from 
the Administrator. A request for approval is to contain the 
identification information required in Sec. 90.604(c) and information 
that demonstrates that the importer is entitled to the exemption or 
exclusion. The following exemptions or exclusions are permitted by this 
paragraph:
    (1) National security exemption. An engine may be imported under the 
national security exemption found at Sec. 90.908.
    (2) Hardship exemption. The Administrator may exempt on a case-by-
case basis an engine from federal emission requirements to accommodate 
unforeseen cases of extreme hardship or extraordinary circumstances.
    (3) Exemption for engines identical to United States certified 
versions.

[[Page 223]]

    (i) A person (including businesses) is eligible for importing an 
engine into the United States under the provisions of this paragraph. An 
exemption will be granted if the engine:
    (A) is owned by the importer;
    (B) is not offered for importation for the purpose of resale; and
    (C) is proven to be identical, in all material respects, to an 
engine certified by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for sale 
in the United States or is proven to have been modified to be identical, 
in all material respects, to an engine certified by the OEM for sale in 
the United States according to complete written instructions provided by 
the OEM's United States representative, or his/her designee.
    (ii) Proof of Conformity. (A) Documentation submitted pursuant to 
this section for the purpose of proving conformity of individual engines 
is to contain sufficiently organized data or evidence demonstrating that 
the engine identified pursuant to Sec. 90.604(c) is identical, in all 
material respects, to an engine identified in an OEM's application for 
certification.
    (B) If the documentation does not contain all the information 
required by this part, or is not sufficiently organized, EPA will notify 
the importer of any areas of inadequacy, and that the documentation will 
not receive further consideration until the required information or 
organization is provided.
    (C) If EPA determines that the documentation does not clearly or 
sufficiently demonstrate that an engine is eligible for importation, EPA 
will notify the importer in writing.
    (D) If EPA determines that the documentation clearly and 
sufficiently demonstrates that an engine is eligible for importation, 
EPA will grant approval for importation and notify the importer in 
writing.
    (d) Foreign diplomatic and military personnel may import a 
nonconforming engine without bond. At the time of admission, the 
importer shall submit to the Administrator the written report required 
in Sec. 90.604(a) and a statement from the U.S. Department of State 
confirming qualification for this exemption. Foreign military personnel 
may, in lieu of a statement from the U.S. Department of State, submit to 
the Administrator a copy of their orders for duty in the United States. 
The engine may not be sold in the United States and must be exported if 
the individual's diplomatic status is no longer applicable, as 
determined by the Department of State, or the foreign military orders 
for duty in the United States are no longer applicable, unless 
subsequently brought into conformity with U.S. emission requirements.
    (e) Competition exclusion. A nonconforming engine may be 
conditionally admitted by any person provided the importer demonstrates 
to the Administrator that the engine is used to propel a nonroad vehicle 
used solely for competition and obtains prior written approval from the 
Administrator. A nonconforming engine imported pursuant to this 
paragraph may not be operated in the United States except for that 
operation incident and necessary for the competition purpose, unless 
subsequently brought into conformity with United States emission 
requirements in accordance with Sec. 90.612(c)(3).
    (f) Exclusions/exemptions based on date of original manufacture.
    (1) Notwithstanding any other requirements of this subpart, engines 
originally manufactured prior to model year 1997 are excluded from the 
requirements of the Act in accordance with section 213 of the Act and 
may be imported by any person.
    (2) Notwithstanding other requirements of this subpart, an engine 
not subject to an exclusion under Sec. 90.612(f)(1) but greater than 20 
original production (OP) years old is entitled to an exemption from the 
requirements of the Act, provided that it has not been modified in those

vehicles do not include features ordinarily associated with military 
combat such as armor and/or weaponry.
    (b) EPA will maintain a list of nonroad engines that have been 
determined to be excluded because they are used solely for competition 
or for combat. This list will be available to the public and may be 
obtained by writing to the following address: Chief, Manufacturers 
Programs Branch, Manufacturers Operations Division (6405-J), 
Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 
20460.
    (c) Upon written request, EPA will make written determinations as to

manufacturer-owned nonroad engines are exempt without application, 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 90.906.
    (e) For any person, display nonroad engines are exempt without 
application, subject to the provisions of Sec. 90.907.


<R05>
Sec. 90.905  Testing exemption.

    (a) Any person requesting a testing exemption must demonstrate the 
following:
    (1) That the proposed test program has a purpose which constitutes 
an appropriate basis for an exemption in accordance with 
Sec. 90.1004(b), and in accordance with subsection (b) of this section;
    (2) That the proposed test program necessitates the granting of an 
exemption, in accordance with subsection (c) of this section;
    (3) That the proposed test program exhibits reasonableness in scope, 
in accordance with subsection (d) of this section; and
    (4) That the proposed test program exhibits a degree of control 
consonant with the purpose of the program and EPA's monitoring 
requirements, in accordance with subsection (e) of this section.
    (b) With respect to the purpose of the proposed test program, an 
appropriate purpose would be research, investigations, studies, 
demonstrations, or training, but not national security. A concise 
statement of purpose is a required item of information.
    (c) With respect to the necessity that an exemption be granted, 
necessity arises from an inability to achieve the stated purpose in a 
practicable manner without performing or causing to be performed one or 
more of the prohibited acts under Sec. 90.1003. In appropriate 
circumstances, time constraints may be a sufficient basis for necessity, 
but the cost of certification alone, in the absence of extraordinary 
circumstances, is not a basis for necessity.
    (d) With respect to reasonableness, a test program must exhibit a 
duration of reasonable length and affect a reasonable number of engines. 
In this regard, required items of information include:
    (1) An estimate of the program's duration; and
    (2) The maximum number of nonroad engines involved.
    (e) With respect to control, the test program must incorporate 
procedures consistent with the purpose of the test

[[Page 228]]

and be capable of affording EPA monitoring capability. As a minimum, 
required items of information include:
    (1) The technical nature of the test;
    (2) The site of the test;
    (3) The duration and accumulated engine operation associated with 
the test;
    (4) The ownership arrangement with regard to the engines involved in 
the test;
    (5) The intended final disposition of the engines;
    (6) The manner in which the engines used in the test will be 
identified, and that identification recorded, and made available; and
    (7) The means or procedure whereby test results will be recorded.
    (f) A manufacturer of new nonroad engines may request a testing 
exemption to cover nonroad engines intended for use in test programs 
planned or anticipated over the course of a subsequent one-year period. 
Unless otherwise required by the Director, Manufacturers Operations 
Division, a manufacturer requesting such an exemption need only furnish 
the information required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (d)(2) of this section 
along with a description of the recordkeeping and control procedures 
that will be employed to assure that the engines are used for purposes 
consistent with Sec. 90.1004(b).


<R05>
Sec. 90.906  Manufacturer-owned exemption and precertification exemption.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any

approved by the Director, Manufacturers Operations Division, the 
manufacturer must permanently affix a label to each nonroad engine on 
exempt status. This label should:
    (i) Be affixed in a readily visible portion of the engine;
    (ii) Be attached in such a manner that it cannot be removed without 
destruction or defacement;
    (iii) State in the English language and in block letters and 
numerals of a color that contrasts with the background of the label, the 
following information:
    (A) The label heading ``Emission Control Information;''
    (B) Full corporate name and trademark of manufacturer;
    (C) Engine displacement, engine family identification, and model 
year of engine; or person or office to be contacted for further 
information about the engine;
    (D) The statement ``This nonroad engine is exempt from the 
prohibitions of 40 CFR 90.1003.''
    (4) No provision of paragraph (a)(3) of this section prevents a 
manufacturer from including any other information it desires on the 
label.


<R05>
Sec. 90.907  Display exemption.

    Where an uncertified nonroad engine is a display engine to be used 
solely for display purposes, will only be operated incident and 
necessary to the display purpose, and will not be sold unless an 
applicable certificate of conformity has been received or the engine has 
been finally admitted pursuant to subpart G of this part, no request for 
exemption of the engine is necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 90.908  National security exemption.

    A manufacturer requesting a national security exemption must state 
the purpose for which the exemption is required and the request must be 
endorsed by an agency of the federal government charged with 
responsibility for national defense.


<R05>
Sec. 90.909  Export exemptions.

    (a) A new nonroad engine intended solely for export, and so labeled 
or tagged on the outside of the container

[[Page 229]]

and on the engine itself, is subject to the provisions of Sec. 90.1003, 
unless the importing country has new nonroad engine emission standards 
which differ from EPA standards.
    (b) For the purpose of paragraph (a) of this section, a country 
having no standards, whatsoever, is deemed to be a country having 
emission standards which differ from EPA standards.
    (c) EPA will maintain a list of foreign countries that have in force 
nonroad emission standards identical to U.S. EPA standards and have so 
notified EPA. This list may be obtained by writing to the following 
address: Chief, Manufacturers Programs Branch, Manufacturers Operations 
Division (6405-J), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, S.W., 
Washington, D.C. 20460. New nonroad engines exported to such countries 
must comply with U.S. EPA certification regulations.
    (d) It is a condition of any exemption for the purpose of export 
under Sec. 90.1004(b) that such exemption be void ab initio with respect 
to a new nonroad engine intended solely for export if such nonroad 
engine is sold, or offered for sale, to an ultimate purchaser in the 
United States for purposes other than export.


<R05>
Sec. 90.910  Granting of exemptions.

    (a) If upon completion of the review of an exemption request made 
pursuant to Sec. 90.905 or Sec. 90.908, EPA determines it is appropriate 
to grant such an exemption, a memorandum of exemption is to be prepared 
and submitted to the person requesting the exemption. The memorandum is 
to set forth the basis for the exemption, its scope, and such terms and 
conditions as are deemed necessary. Such terms and conditions generally 
include, but are not limited to, agreements by the applicant to conduct 
the exempt activity in the manner described to EPA, create and maintain 
adequate records accessible to EPA at reasonable times, employ labels 
for the exempt engines setting forth the nature of the exemption, take 
appropriate measures to assure that the terms of the exemption are met, 
and advise EPA of the termination of the activity and the ultimate 
disposition of the engines.
    (b) Any exemption granted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
is deemed to cover any subject engine only to the extent that the 
specified terms and conditions are complied with. A breach of any term 
or condition causes the exemption to be void ab initio with respect to 
any engine. Consequently, the causing or the performing of an act 
prohibited under Sec. 90.1003(a) (1) or (3), other than in strict 
conformity with all terms and conditions of this exemption, renders the 
person to whom the exemption is granted, and any other person to whom 
the provisions of Sec. 90.1003 are applicable, liable to suit under 
sections 204 and 205 of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 90.911  Submission of exemption requests.

    Requests for exemption or further information concerning exemptions 
and/or the exemption request review procedure should be addressed to:

acting in compliance with this part or to otherwise carry out the 
provisions of this part, and must, upon request of an officer or 
employee duly designated by the Administrator, permit the officer or 
employee at reasonable times to have access to and copy such records. 
The manufacturer shall comply in all respects with the requirements of 
subpart I of this part.
    (2) For purposes of enforcement of this part, an officer or employee 
duly designated by the Administrator, upon presenting appropriate 
credentials, is authorized:
    (i) To enter, at reasonable times, any establishment of the 
manufacturer, or of any person whom the manufacturer engaged to perform 
any activity required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for the 
purposes of inspecting or observing any activity conducted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and
    (ii) To inspect records, files, papers, processes, controls, and 
facilities used in performing an activity required by paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section, by the manufacturer or by a person whom the 
manufacturer engaged to perform the activity.
    (b) Exemption provision. The Administrator may exempt a new nonroad 
engine from Sec. 90.1003 upon such terms and conditions as the 
Administrator may find necessary for the purpose of export, research, 
investigations, studies, demonstrations, or training, or for reasons of 
national security.
    (c) Importation provision. (1) A new nonroad engine or vehicle 
offered for importation or imported by a person in violation of 
Sec. 90.1003 is to be refused admission into the United States, but the 
Secretary of the Treasury and the Administrator may, by joint 
regulation, provide for deferring a final determination as to admission 
and authorizing the delivery of such a nonroad engine offered for import 
to the owner or consignee thereof upon such terms and conditions 
(including the furnishing of a bond) as may appear to them appropriate 
to insure that the nonroad engine will be brought into conformity with 
the standards, requirements, and limitations applicable to it under this 
part.
    (2) If a nonroad engine is finally refused admission under this 
paragraph, the Secretary of the Treasury shall cause disposition thereof 
in accordance with the customs laws unless it is exported, under 
regulations prescribed by the Secretary, within 90 days of the date of 
notice of the refusal or additional time as may be permitted pursuant to 
the regulations.
    (3) Disposition in accordance with the customs laws may not be made 
in such manner as may result, directly or indirectly, in the sale, to 
the ultimate purchaser, of a new nonroad engine that fails to comply 
with applicable standards of the Administrator under this part.
    (d) Export provision. A new nonroad engine intended solely for 
export, and

[[Page 232]]

so labeled or tagged on the outside of the container and on the engine 
itself, shall be subject to the provisions of Sec. 90.1003, except that 
if the country that is to receive the engine has emission standards that 
differ from the standards prescribed under subpart B of this part, then 
the engine must comply with the standards of the country that is to 
receive the engine.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1005  Injunction proceedings for prohibited acts.

    (a) The district courts of the United States have jurisdiction to 
restrain violations of Sec. 90.1003.
    (b) Actions to restrain such violations must be brought by and in 
the name of the United States. In an action, subpoenas for witnesses who 
are required to attend a district court in any district may run into any 
other district.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1006  Penalties.

    (a) Violations. A violation of the requirements of this subpart is a 
violation of the applicable provisions of the Act and is subject to the 
penalty provisions thereunder.
    (1) A person who violates Sec. 90.1003(a)(1), (a)(4), or (a)(5), or 
a manufacturer or dealer who violates Sec. 90.1003(a)(3)(i), is subject 
to a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 for each violation.
    (2) A person other than a manufacturer or dealer who violates 
Sec. 90.1003(a)(3)(i) or any person who violates Sec. 90.1003(a)(3)(ii) 
is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $2,500 for each 
violation.
    (3) A violation with respect to Sec. 90.1003(a)(1), (a)(3)(i), 
(a)(4), or (a)(5) constitutes a separate offense with respect to each 
nonroad engine.
    (4) A violation with respect to Sec. 90.1003(a)(3)(ii) constitutes a 
separate offense with respect to each part or component. Each day of a 
violation with respect to Sec. 90.1003(a)(6) constitutes a separate 
offense.
    (5) A person who violates Sec. 90.1003(a)(2) or (a)(6) is subject to 
a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 per day of violation.
    (b) Civil actions. The Administrator may commence a civil action to 
assess and recover any civil penalty under paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (1) An action under this paragraph may be brought in the district 
court of the United States for the district in which the violation is 
alleged to have occurred, the defendant resides, or the Administrator's 
principal place of business is located, and in which the court has 
jurisdiction to assess a civil penalty.
    (2) In determining the amount of a civil penalty to be assessed 
under this paragraph, the court is to take into account the gravity of 
the violation, the economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from 
the violation, the size of the violator's business, the violator's 
history of compliance with Title II of the Act, action taken to remedy 
the violation, the effect of the penalty on the violator's ability to 
continue in business, and such other matters as justice may require.
    (3) In any such action, subpoenas for witnesses who are required to 
attend a district court in any district may run into any other district.
    (c) Administrative assessment of certain penalties. (1) 
Administrative penalty authority. In lieu of commencing a civil action 
under paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator shall assess any 
civil penalty prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, except that 
the maximum amount of penalty sought against each violator in a penalty 
assessment proceeding can not exceed $200,000, unless the Administrator 
and the Attorney General jointly determine that a matter involving a 
larger penalty amount is appropriate for administrative penalty 
assessment. Any such determination by the Administrator and the Attorney 
General is not subject to judicial review. Assessment of a civil penalty 
is made by an order made on the record after opportunity for a hearing 
held in accordance with the procedures found at part 22 of this chapter. 
The Administrator may compromise, or remit, with or without conditions, 
any administrative penalty which may be imposed under this section.
    (2) Determining amount. In determining the amount of any civil 
penalty assessed under this subsection, the Administrator is to take 
into account the

[[Page 233]]

gravity of the violation, the economic benefit or savings (if any) 
resulting from the violation, the size of the violator's business, the 
violator's history of compliance with Title II of the Act, action taken 
to remedy the violation, the effect of the penalty on the violator's 
ability to continue in business, and such other matters as justice may 
require.
    (3) Effect of administrator's action. (i) Action by the 
Administrator under this paragraph does not affect or limit the 
Administrator's authority to enforce any provisions of this part; except 
that any violation with respect to which the Administrator has commenced 
and is diligently prosecuting an action under this part, or for which 
the Administrator has issued a final order not subject to further 
judicial review and for which the violator has paid a penalty assessment 
under this part may not be the subject of a civil penalty action under 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (ii) No action by the Administrator under this part affects a 
person's obligation to comply with a section of this part.
    (4) Finality of order. An order issued under this part becomes final 
30 days after its issuance unless a petition for judicial review is 
filed under paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
    (5) Judicial review. (i) A person against whom a civil penalty is 
assessed in accordance with this part may seek review of the assessment 
in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or for 
the district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred, in 
which such person resides, or where the person's principle place of 
business is located, within the 30-day period beginning on the date a 
civil penalty order is issued. The person must simultaneously send a 
copy of the filing by certified mail to the Administrator and the 
Attorney General.
    (ii) The Administrator must file in the court within 30 days a 
certified copy, or certified index, as appropriate, of the record on 
which the order was issued. The court is not to set aside or remand any 
order issued in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph 
unless substantial evidence does not exist in the record, taken as a 
whole, to support the finding of a violation or unless the 
Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of 
discretion, and the court is not to impose additional civil penalties 
unless the Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an 
abuse of discretion. In any proceedings, the United States may seek to 
recover civil penalties assessed under this section.
    (6) Collection. (i) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a 
civil penalty imposed by the Administrator as provided in this part 
after the order making the assessment has become final or after a court 
in an action brought under paragraph (c)(5) of this section has entered 
a final judgment in favor of the Administrator, the Administrator is to 
request that the Attorney General bring a civil action in an appropriate 
district court to recover the amount assessed (plus interest at rates 
established pursuant to section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986 from the date of the final order or the date of final judgment, 
as the case may be). In such an action, the validity, amount, and 
appropriateness of the penalty are not subject to review.
    (ii) A person who fails to pay on a timely basis the amount of an 
assessment of a civil penalty as described in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of 
this section is required to pay, in addition to that amount and 
interest, the United States' enforcement expenses, including attorney's 
fees and costs for collection proceedings, and a quarterly nonpayment 
penalty for each quarter during which the failure to pay persists. The 
nonpayment penalty is an amount equal to 10 percent of the aggregate 
amount of that person's penalties and nonpayment penalties which are 
unpaid as of the beginning of such quarter.

<R05>
Sec. 90.1101  Applicability.

    The requirements of subpart L are applicable to all nonroad engines 
and vehicles subject to the provisions of subpart A of part 90.

[[Page 234]]


<R05>
Sec. 90.1102  Definitions.

    The definitions of subpart A of this part apply to this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1103  Emission warranty, warranty period.

    (a) Warranties imposed by this subpart shall be for the first two 
years of engine use from the date of sale to the ultimate purchaser.
    (b) The manufacturer of each new nonroad engine must warrant to the 
ultimate purchaser and each subsequent purchaser that the engine is 
designed, built, and equipped so as to conform at the time of sale with 
applicable regulations under section 213 of the Act, and the engine is 
free from defects in materials and workmanship which cause such engine 
to fail to conform with applicable regulations for its warranty period.
    (c) In the case of a nonroad engine part, the manufacturer or 
rebuilder of the part may certify according to Sec. 85.2112 of this 
chapter that use of the part will not result in a failure of the engine 
to comply with emission standards promulgated in this part.
    (d) For the purposes of this section, the owner of any nonroad 
engine warranted under this part is responsible for the proper 
maintenance of the engine as stated in the manufacturer's written 
instructions. Proper maintenance generally includes replacement and 
service, at the owner's expense at a service establishment or facility 
of the owner's choosing, such items as spark plugs, points, condensers, 
and any other part, item, or device related to emission control (but not 
designed for emission control) under the terms of the last sentence of 
section 207(a)(3) of the Act, unless such part, item, or device is 
covered by any warranty not mandated by this Act.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1104  Furnishing of maintenance instructions to ultimate purchaser.

    (a) The manufacturer must furnish or cause to be furnished to the 
ultimate purchaser of each new nonroad engine written instructions for 
the maintenance needed to assure proper functioning of the emission 
control system.
    (b) The manufacturer must provide in boldface type on the first page 
of the written maintenance instructions notice that maintenance, 
replacement, or repair of the emission control devices and systems may 
be performed by any nonroad engine repair establishment or individual.
    (c) The instructions under paragraph (b) of this section will not 
include any condition on the ultimate purchaser's using, in connection 
with such engine, any component or service (other than a component or 
service provided without charge under the terms of the purchase 
agreement) which is identified by brand, trade, or corporate name. Such 
instructions also will not directly or indirectly distinguish between 
service performed by the franchised dealers of such manufacturer or any 
other service establishments with which such manufacturer has a 
commercial relationship and service performed by independent nonroad 
engine repair facilities with which such manufacturer has no commercial 
relationship.
    (d) The prohibition of paragraph (c) of this section may be waived 
by the Administrator if:
    (1) The manufacturer satisfies the Administrator that the engine 
will function properly only if the component or service so identified is 
used in connection with such engine; and
    (2) The Administrator finds that such a waiver is in the public 
interest.

   Subpart A--Conformity to State or Federal Implementation Plans of 
   Transportation Plans, Programs, and Projects Developed, Funded or 
        Approved Under Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act


<R05>
Sec. 93.100  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to implement section 176(c) of the 
Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), and the 
related requirements of 23 U.S.C. 109(j), with respect to the conformity 
of transportation plans, programs, and projects which are developed, 
funded, or approved by the United States Department of Transportation 
(DOT), and by metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) or other 
recipients of funds under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (49 
U.S.C. 1601 et seq.). This subpart sets forth policy, criteria, and 
procedures for demonstrating and assuring conformity of such activities 
to an applicable implementation plan developed pursuant to section 110 
and part D of the CAA.

[[Page 236]]


<R05>
Sec. 93.101  Definitions.

    Terms used but not defined in this subpart shall have the meaning 
given them by the CAA, titles 23 and 49 U.S.C., other Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, or other DOT regulations, in that 
order of priority.
    Applicable implementation plan is defined in section 302(q) of the 
CAA and means the portion (or portions) of the implementation plan, or 
most recent revision thereof, which has been approved under section 110, 
or promulgated under section 110(c), or promulgated or approved pursuant 
to regulations promulgated under section 301(d) and which implements the 
relevant requirements of the CAA.
    CAA means the Clean Air Act, as amended.
    Cause or contribute to a new violation for a project means:
    (1) To cause or contribute to a new violation of a standard in the 
area substantially affected by the project or over a region which would 
otherwise not be in violation of the standard during the future period 
in question, if the project were not implemented, or
    (2) To contribute to a new violation in a manner that would increase 
the frequency or severity of a new violation of a standard in such area.
    Control strategy implementation plan revision is the applicable 
implementation plan which contains specific strategies for controlling 
the emissions of and reducing ambient levels of pollutants in order to 
satisfy CAA requirements for demonstrations of reasonable further 
progress and attainment (CAA sections 182(b)(1), 182(c)(2)(A), 
182(c)(2)(B), 187(a)(7), 189(a)(1)(B), and 189(b)(1)(A); and sections 
192(a) and 192(b), for nitrogen dioxide).
    Control strategy period with respect to particulate matter less than 
10 microns in diameter (PM<INF>10), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen 
dioxide (NO<INF>2), and/or ozone precursors (volatile organic compounds 
and oxides of nitrogen), means that period of time after EPA approves 
control strategy implementation plan revisions containing strategies for 
controlling PM<INF>10, NO<INF>2, CO, and/or ozone, as appropriate. This 
period ends when a State submits and EPA approves a request under 
section 107(d) of the CAA for redesignation to an attainment area.
    Design concept means the type of facility identified by the project, 
e.g., freeway, expressway, arterial highway, grade-separated highway, 
reserved right-of-way rail transit, mixed-traffic rail transit, 
exclusive busway, etc.
    Design scope means the design aspects which will affect the proposed 
facility's impact on regional emissions, usually as they relate to 
vehicle or person carrying capacity and control, e.g., number of lanes 
or tracks to be constructed or added, length of project, signalization, 
access control including approximate number and location of 
interchanges, preferential treatment for high-occupancy vehicles, etc.
    DOT means the United States Department of Transportation.
    EPA means the Environmental Protection Agency.
    FHWA means the Federal Highway Administration of DOT.
    FHWA/FTA project, for the purpose of this subpart, is any highway or 
transit project which is proposed to receive funding assistance and 
approval through the Federal-Aid Highway program or the Federal mass 
transit program, or requires Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) or 
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) approval for some aspect of the 
project, such as connection to an interstate highway or deviation from 
applicable design standards on the interstate system.
    FTA means the Federal Transit Administration of DOT.
    Forecast period with respect to a transportation plan is the period 
covered by the transportation plan pursuant to 23 CFR part 450.
    Highway project is an undertaking to implement or modify a highway 
facility or highway-related program. Such an undertaking consists of all 
required phases necessary for implementation. For analytical purposes, 
it must be defined sufficiently to:
    (1) Connect logical termini and be of sufficient length to address 
environmental matters on a broad scope;
    (2) Have independent utility or significance, i.e., be usable and be 
a reasonable expenditure even if no additional transportation 
improvements in the area are made; and

[[Page 237]]

    (3) Not restrict consideration of alternatives for other reasonably 
foreseeable transportation improvements.
    Horizon year is a year for which the transportation plan describes 
the envisioned transportation system according to Sec. 93.106.
    Hot-spot analysis is an estimation of likely future localized CO and 
PM<INF>10 pollutant concentrations and a comparison of those 
concentrations to the national ambient air quality standards. Pollutant 
concentrations to be estimated should be based on the total emissions 
burden which may result from the implementation of a single, specific 
project, summed together with future background concentrations (which 
can be estimated using the ratio of future to current traffic multiplied 
by the ratio of future to current emission factors) expected in the 
area. The total concentration must be estimated and analyzed at 
appropriate receptor locations in the area substantially affected by the 
project. Hot-spot analysis assesses impacts on a scale smaller than the 
entire nonattainment or maintenance area, including, for example, 
congested roadway intersections and highways or transit terminals, and 
uses an air quality dispersion model to determine the effects of 
emissions on air quality.
    Incomplete data area means any ozone nonattainment area which EPA 
has classified, in 40 CFR part 81, as an incomplete data area.
    Increase the frequency or severity means to cause a location or 
region to exceed a standard more often or to cause a violation at a 
greater concentration than previously existed and/or would otherwise 
exist during the future period in question, if the project were not 
implemented.
    ISTEA means the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 
1991.
    Maintenance area means any geographic region of the United States 
previously designated nonattainment pursuant to the CAA Amendments of 
1990 and subsequently redesignated to attainment subject to the 
requirement to develop a maintenance plan under section 175A of the CAA, 
as amended.
    Maintenance period with respect to a pollutant or pollutant 
precursor means that period of time beginning when a State submits and 
EPA approves a request under section 107(d) of the CAA for redesignation 
to an attainment area, and lasting for 20 years, unless the applicable 
implementation plan specifies that the maintenance period shall last for 
more than 20 years.
    Metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is that organization 
designated as being responsible, together with the State, for conducting 
the continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive planning process under 23 
U.S.C. 134 and 49 U.S.C. 1607. It is the forum for cooperative 
transportation decision- making.
    Milestone has the meaning given in sections 182(g)(1) and 189(c) of 
the CAA. A milestone consists of an emissions level and the date on 
which it is required to be achieved.
    Motor vehicle emissions budget is that portion of the total 
allowable emissions defined in a revision to the applicable 
implementation plan (or in an implementation plan revision which was 
endorsed by the Governor or his or her designee, subject to a public 
hearing, and submitted to EPA, but not yet approved by EPA) for a 
certain date for the purpose of meeting reasonable further progress 
milestones or attainment or maintenance demonstrations, for any criteria 
pollutant or its precursors, allocated by the applicable implementation 
plan to highway and transit vehicles. The applicable implementation plan 
for an ozone nonattainment area may also designate a motor vehicle 
emissions budget for oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X) for a reasonable 
further progress milestone year if the applicable implementation plan 
demonstrates that this NO<INF>X budget will be achieved with measures in 
the implementation plan (as an implementation plan must do for VOC 
milestone requirements). The applicable implementation plan for an ozone 
nonattainment area includes a NO<INF>X budget if NO<INF>X reductions are 
being substituted for reductions in volatile organic compounds in 
milestone years required for reasonable further progress.
    National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) are those standards 
established pursuant to section 109 of the CAA.
    NEPA means the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended 
(42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).

[[Page 238]]

    NEPA process completion, for the purposes of this subpart, with 
respect to FHWA or FTA, means the point at which there is a specific 
action to make a determination that a project is categorically excluded, 
to make a Finding of No Significant Impact, or to issue a record of 
decision on a Final Environmental Impact Statement under NEPA.
    Nonattainment area means any geographic region of the United States 
which has been designated as nonattainment under section 107 of the CAA 
for any pollutant for which a national ambient air quality standard 
exists.
    Not classified area means any carbon monoxide nonattainment area 
which EPA has not classified as either moderate or serious.
    Phase II of the interim period with respect to a pollutant or 
pollutant precursor means that period of time after the effective date 
of this rule, lasting until the earlier of the following: submission to 
EPA of the relevant control strategy implementation plan revisions which 
have been endorsed by the Governor (or his or her designee) and have 
been subject to a public hearing, or the date that the Clean Air Act 
requires relevant control strategy implementation plans to be submitted 
to EPA, provided EPA has notified the State, MPO, and DOT of the State's 
failure to submit any such plans. The precise end of Phase II of the 
interim period is defined in Sec. 93.128.
    Project means a highway project or transit project.
    Protective finding means a determination by EPA that the control 
strategy contained in a submitted control strategy implementation plan 
revision would have been considered approvable with respect to 
requirements for emissions reductions if all committed measures had been 
submitted in enforceable form as required by Clean Air Act section 
110(a)(2)(A).
    Recipient of funds designated under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal 
Transit Act means any agency at any level of State, county, city, or 
regional government that routinely receives title 23 U.S.C. or Federal 
Transit Act funds to construct FHWA/FTA projects, operate FHWA/FTA 
projects or equipment, purchase equipment, or undertake other services 
or operations via contracts or agreements. This definition does not 
include private landowners or developers, or contractors or entities 
that are only paid for services or products created by their own 
employees.
    Regionally significant project means a transportation project (other 
than an exempt project) that is on a facility which serves regional 
transportation needs (such as access to and from the area outside of the 
region, major activity centers in the region, major planned developments 
such as new retail malls, sports complexes, etc., or transportation 
terminals as well as most terminals themselves) and would normally be 
included in the modeling of a metropolitan area's transportation 
network, including at a minimum all principal arterial highways and all 
fixed guideway transit facilities that offer an alternative to regional 
highway travel.
    Rural transport ozone nonattainment area means an ozone 
nonattainment area that does not include, and is not adjacent to, any 
part of a Metropolitan Statistical Area or, where one exists, a 
Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (as defined by the United 
States Bureau of the Census) and is classified under Clean Air Act 
section 182(h) as a rural transport area.
    Standard means a national ambient air quality standard.
    Submarginal area means any ozone nonattainment area which EPA has 
classified as submarginal in 40 CFR part 81.
    Transit is mass transportation by bus, rail, or other conveyance 
which provides general or special service to the public on a regular and 
continuing basis. It does not include school buses or charter or 
sightseeing services.
    Transit project is an undertaking to implement or modify a transit 
facility or transit-related program; purchase transit vehicles or 
equipment; or provide financial assistance for transit operations. It 
does not include actions that are solely within the jurisdiction of 
local transit agencies, such as changes in routes, schedules, or fares. 
It may consist of several phases. For analytical purposes, it must be 
defined inclusively enough to:

[[Page 239]]

    (1) Connect logical termini and be of sufficient length to address 
environmental matters on a broad scope;
    (2) Have independent utility or independent significance, i.e., be a 
reasonable expenditure even if no additional transportation improvements 
in the area are made; and
    (3) Not restrict consideration of alternatives for other reasonably 
foreseeable transportation improvements.
    Transitional area means any ozone nonattainment area which EPA has 
classified as transitional in 40 CFR part 81.
    Transitional period with respect to a pollutant or pollutant 
precursor means that period of time which begins after submission to EPA 
of the relevant control strategy implementation plan which has been 
endorsed by the Governor (or his or her designee) and has been subject 
to a public hearing. The transitional period lasts until EPA takes final 
approval or disapproval action on the control strategy implementation 
plan submission or finds it to be incomplete. The precise beginning and 
end of the transitional period is defined in Sec. 93.128.
    Transportation control measure (TCM) is any measure that is 
specifically identified and committed to in the applicable 
implementation plan that is either one of the types listed in Sec. 108 
of the CAA, or any other measure for the purpose of reducing emissions 
or concentrations of air pollutants from transportation sources by 
reducing vehicle use or changing traffic flow or congestion conditions. 
Notwithstanding the above, vehicle technology-based, fuel-based, and 
maintenance-based measures which control the emissions from vehicles 
under fixed traffic conditions are not TCMs for the purposes of this 
subpart.
    Transportation improvement program (TIP) means a staged, multiyear, 
intermodal program of transportation projects covering a metropolitan 
planning area which is consistent with the metropolitan transportation 
plan, and developed pursuant to 23 CFR part 450.
    Transportation plan means the official intermodal metropolitan 
transportation plan that is developed through the metropolitan planning 
process for the metropolitan planning area, developed pursuant to 23 CFR 
part 450.
    Transportation project is a highway project or a transit project.

Sec. 93.102  Applicability.

    (a) Action applicability. (1) Except as provided for in paragraph 
(c) of this section or Sec. 93.134, conformity determinations are 
required for:
    (i) The adoption, acceptance, approval or support of transportation 
plans developed pursuant to 23 CFR part 450 or 49 CFR part 613 by an MPO 
or DOT;
    (ii) The adoption, acceptance, approval or support of TIPs developed 
pursuant to 23 CFR part 450 or 49 CFR part 613 by an MPO or DOT; and
    (iii) The approval, funding, or implementation of FHWA/FTA projects.
    (2) Conformity determinations are not required under this rule for 
individual projects which are not FHWA/FTA projects. However, 
Sec. 93.129 applies to such projects if they are regionally significant.
    (b) Geographic applicability. (1) The provisions of this subpart 
shall apply in all nonattainment and maintenance areas for 
transportation-related criteria pollutants for which the area is 
designated nonattainment or has a maintenance plan.
    (2) The provisions of this subpart apply with respect to emissions 
of the following criteria pollutants: ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen 
dioxide, and particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal 
to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM<INF>10).
    (3) The provisions of this subpart apply with respect to emissions 
of the following precursor pollutants:
    (i) Volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides in ozone areas;
    (ii) Nitrogen oxides in nitrogen dioxide areas; and
    (iii) Volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and PM<INF>10 in 
PM<INF>10 areas if:
    (A) During the interim period, the EPA Regional Administrator or the 
director of the State air agency has made a finding that transportation-
related

[[Page 240]]

precursor emissions within the nonattainment area are a significant 
contributor to the PM<INF>10 nonattainment problem and has so notified 
the MPO and DOT; or
    (B) During the transitional, control strategy, and maintenance 
periods, the applicable implementation plan (or implementation plan 
submission) establishes a budget for such emissions as part of the 
reasonable further progress, attainment or maintenance strategy.
    (c) Limitations. (1) Projects subject to this regulation for which 
the NEPA process and a conformity determination have been completed by 
FHWA or FTA may proceed toward implementation without further conformity 
determinations if one of the following major steps has occurred within 
the past three years: NEPA process completion; start of final design; 
acquisition of a significant portion of the right-of-way; or approval of 
the plans, specifications and estimates. All phases of such projects 
which were considered in the conformity determination are also included, 
if those phases were for the purpose of funding, final design, right-of-
way acquisition, construction, or any combination of these phases.
    (2) A new conformity determination for the project will be required 
if there is a significant change in project design concept and scope, if 
a supplemental environmental document for air quality purposes is 
initiated, or if no major steps to advance the project have occurred 
within the past three years.
    (d) Grace period for new nonattainment areas. For areas or portions 
of areas which have been in attainment for either ozone, CO, PM-10, or 
NO<INF>2 since 1990 and are subsequently redesignated to nonattainment 
for any of these pollutants, the provisions of this subpart shall not 
apply for such pollutant for 12 months following the date of final 
designation to nonattainment.

[58 FR 62235, Nov. 24, 1993, as amended at 60 FR 57184, Nov. 14, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 93.103  Priority.

    When assisting or approving any action with air quality-related 
consequences, FHWA and FTA shall give priority to the implementation of 
those transportation portions of an applicable implementation plan 
prepared to attain and maintain the NAAQS. This priority shall be 
consistent with statutory requirements for allocation of funds among 
States or other jurisdictions.


<R05>
Sec. 93.104  Frequency of conformity determinations.

    (a) Conformity determinations and conformity redeterminations for 
transportation plans, TIPs, and FHWA/FTA projects must be made according 
to the requirements of this section and the applicable implementation 
plan.
    (b) Transportation plans. (1) Each new transportation plan must be 
found to conform before the transportation plan is approved by the MPO 
or accepted by DOT.
    (2) All transportation plan revisions must be found to conform 
before the transportation plan revisions are approved by MPO or accepted 
by DOT, unless the revision merely adds or deletes exempt projects 
listed in Sec. 93.134. The conformity determination must be based on the 
transportation plan and the revision taken as a whole.
    (3) Conformity of existing transportation plans must be redetermined 
within 18 months of the following, or the existing conformity 
determination will lapse:
    (i) November 24, 1993;
    (ii) EPA approval of an implementation plan revision which:
    (A) Establishes or revises a transportation-related emissions budget 
(as required by CAA sections 175A(a), 182(b)(1), 182(c)(2)(A), 
182(c)(2)(B), 187(a)(7), 189(a)(1)(B), and 189(b)(1)(A); and sections 
192(a) and 192(b), for nitrogen dioxide); or
    (B) Adds, deletes, or changes TCMs; and
    (iii) EPA promulgation of an implementation plan which establishes 
or revises a transportation-related emissions budget or adds, deletes, 
or changes TCMs.
    (4) In any case, conformity determinations must be made no less 
frequently than every three years, or the existing conformity 
determination will lapse.
    (c) Transportation improvement programs. (1) A new TIP must be found 
to

[[Page 241]]

conform before the TIP is approved by the MPO or accepted by DOT.
    (2) A TIP amendment requires a new conformity determination for the 
entire TIP before the amendment is approved by the MPO or accepted by 
DOT, unless the amendment merely adds or deletes exempt projects listed 
in Sec. 93.134.
    (3) After an MPO adopts a new or revised transportation plan, 
conformity must be redetermined by the MPO and DOT within six months 
from the date of adoption of the plan, unless the new or revised plan 
merely adds or deletes exempt projects listed in Sec. 93.134. Otherwise, 
the existing conformity determination for the TIP will lapse.
    (4) In any case, conformity determinations must be made no less 
frequently than every three years or the existing conformity 
determination will lapse.
    (d) Projects. FHWA/FTA projects must be found to conform before they 
are adopted, accepted, approved, or funded. Conformity must be 
redetermined for any FHWA/FTA project if none of the following major 
steps has occurred within the past three years: NEPA process completion; 
start of final design; acquisition of a significant portion of the 
right-of-way; or approval of the plans, specifications and estimates.


<R05>
Sec. 93.105  Consultation.

    (a) General. The implementation plan revision required under 
Sec. 51.396 of this chapter will include procedures for interagency 
consultation (Federal, State, and local), and resolution of conflicts.
    (1) The implementation plan revision will include procedures to be 
undertaken by MPOs, State departments of transportation, and DOT with 
State and local air quality agencies and EPA before making conformity 
determinations, and by State and local air agencies and EPA with MPOs, 
State departments of transportation, and DOT in developing applicable 
implementation plans.
    (2) Before the implementation plan revision is approved by EPA, MPOs 
and State departments of transportation before making conformity 
determinations must provide reasonable opportunity for consultation with 
State air agencies, local air quality and transportation agencies, DOT, 
and EPA, including consultation on the issues described in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section.
    (b) Interagency consultation procedures: General factors. (1) States 
will provide in the implementation plan well-defined consultation 
procedures whereby representatives of the MPOs, State and local air 
quality planning agencies, State and local transportation agencies, and 
other organizations with responsibilities for developing, submitting, or 
implementing provisions of an implementation plan required by the CAA 
must consult with each other and with local or regional offices of EPA, 
FHWA, and FTA on the development of the implementation plan, the 
transportation plan, the TIP, and associated conformity determinations.
    (2) Interagency consultation procedures will include at a minimum 
the general factors listed below and the specific processes in paragraph 
(c) of this section:
    (i) The roles and responsibilities assigned to each agency at each 
stage in the implementation plan development process and the 
transportation planning process, including technical meetings;
    (ii) The organizational level of regular consultation;
    (iii) A process for circulating (or providing ready access to) draft 
documents and supporting materials for comment before formal adoption or 
publication;
    (iv) The frequency of, or process for convening, consultation 
meetings and responsibilities for establishing meeting agendas;
    (v) A process for responding to the significant comments of involved 
agencies; and
    (vi) A process for the development of a list of the TCMs which are 
in the applicable implementation plan.
    (c) Interagency consultation procedures: Specific processes. 
Interagency consultation procedures will also include the following 
specific processes:
    (1) A process involving the MPO, State and local air quality 
planning

[[Page 242]]

agencies, State and local transportation agencies, EPA, and DOT for the 
following:
    (i) Evaluating and choosing a model (or models) and associated 
methods and assumptions to be used in hot-spot analyses and regional 
emissions analyses;
    (ii) Determining which minor arterials and other transportation 
projects should be considered ``regionally significant'' for the 
purposes of regional emissions analysis (in addition to those 
functionally classified as principal arterial or higher or fixed 
guideway systems or extensions that offer an alternative to regional 
highway travel), and which projects should be considered to have a 
significant change in design concept and scope from the transportation 
plan or TIP;
    (iii) Evaluating whether projects otherwise exempted from meeting 
the requirements of this subpart (see Secs. 93.134 and 93.135) should be 
treated as non-exempt in cases where potential adverse emissions impacts 
may exist for any reason;
    (iv) Making a determination, as required by Sec. 93.113(c)(1), 
whether past obstacles to implementation of TCMs which are behind the 
schedule established in the applicable implementation plan have been 
identified and are being overcome, and whether State and local agencies 
with influence over approvals or funding for TCMs are giving maximum 
priority to approval or funding for TCMs. This process shall also 
consider whether delays in TCM implementation necessitate revisions to 
the applicable implementation plan to remove TCMs or substitute TCMs or 
other emission reduction measures;
    (v) Identifying, as required by Sec. 93.131(d), projects located at 
sites in PM<INF>10 nonattainment areas which have vehicle and roadway 
emission and dispersion characteristics which are essentially identical 
to those at sites which have violations verified by monitoring, and 
therefore require quantitative PM<INF>10 hot-spot analysis; and
    (vi) Notification of transportation plan or TIP revisions or 
amendments which merely add or delete exempt projects listed in 
Sec. 93.134.
    (2) A process involving the MPO and State and local air quality 
planning agencies and transportation agencies for the following:
    (i) Evaluating events which will trigger new conformity 
determinations in addition to those triggering events established in 
Sec. 93.104; and
    (ii) Consulting on emissions analysis for transportation activities 
which cross the borders of MPOs or nonattainment areas or air basins.
    (3) Where the metropolitan planning area does not include the entire 
nonattainment or maintenance area, a process involving the MPO and the 
State department of transportation for cooperative planning and analysis 
for purposes of determining conformity of all projects outside the 
metropolitan area and within the nonattainment or maintenance area.
    (4) A process to ensure that plans for construction of regionally 
significant projects which are not FHWA/FTA projects (including projects 
for which alternative locations, design concept and scope, or the no-
build option are still being considered), including those by recipients 
of funds designated under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act, 
are disclosed to the MPO on a regular basis, and to ensure that any 
changes to those plans are immediately disclosed;
    (5) A process involving the MPO and other recipients of funds 
designated under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act for assuming 
the location and design concept and scope of projects which are 
disclosed to the MPO as required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section but 
whose sponsors have not yet decided these features, in sufficient detail 
to perform the regional emissions analysis according to the requirements 
of Sec. 93.130.
    (6) A process for consulting on the design, schedule, and funding of 
research and data collection efforts and regional transportation model 
development by the MPO (e.g., household/travel transportation surveys).
    (7) A process (including Federal agencies) for providing final 
documents (including applicable implementation plans and implementation 
plan revisions) and supporting information to each agency after approval 
or adoption.
    (d) Resolving conflicts. Conflicts among State agencies or between 
State

[[Page 243]]

agencies and an MPO shall be escalated to the Governor if they cannot be 
resolved by the heads of the involved agencies. The State air agency has 
14 calendar days to appeal to the Governor after the State DOT or MPO 
has notified the State air agency head of the resolution of his or her 
comments. The implementation plan revision required by Sec. 51.396 of 
this chapter shall define the procedures for starting of the 14-day 
clock. If the State air agency appeals to the Governor, the final 
conformity determination must have the concurrence of the Governor. If 
the State air agency does not appeal to the Governor within 14 days, the 
MPO or State department of transportation may proceed with the final 
conformity determination. The Governor may delegate his or her role in 
this process, but not to the head or staff of the State or local air 
agency, State department of transportation, State transportation 
commission or board, or an MPO.
    (e) Public consultation procedures. Affected agencies making 
conformity determinations on transportation plans, programs, and 
projects shall establish a proactive public involvement process which 
provides opportunity for public review and comment prior to taking 
formal action on a conformity determination for all transportation plans 
and TIPs, consistent with the requirements of 23 CFR part 450. In 
addition, these agencies must specifically address in writing all public 
comments that known plans for a regionally significant project which is 
not receiving FHWA or FTA funding or approval have not been properly 
reflected in the emissions analysis supporting a proposed conformity 
finding for a transportation plan or TIP. These agencies shall also 
provide opportunity for public involvement in conformity determinations 
for projects where otherwise required by law.


<R05>
Sec. 93.106  Content of transportation plans.

    (a) Transportation plans adopted after January 1, 1995 in serious, 
severe, or extreme ozone nonattainment areas and in serious carbon 
monoxide nonattainment areas. The transportation plan must specifically 
describe the transportation system envisioned for certain future years 
which shall be called horizon years.
    (1) The agency or organization developing the transportation plan 
may choose any years to be horizon years, subject to the following 
restrictions:
    (i) Horizon years may be no more than 10 years apart.
    (ii) The first horizon year may be no more than 10 years from the 
base year used to validate the transportation demand planning model.
    (iii) If the attainment year is in the time span of the 
transportation plan, the attainment year must be a horizon year.
    (iv) The last horizon year must be the last year of the 
transportation plan's forecast period.
    (2) For these horizon years:
    (i) The transportation plan shall quantify and document the 
demographic and employment factors influencing expected transportation 
demand, including land use forecasts, in accordance with implementation 
plan provisions and Sec. 93.105;
    (ii) The highway and transit system shall be described in terms of 
the regionally significant additions or modifications to the existing 
transportation network which the transportation plan envisions to be 
operational in the horizon years. Additions and modifications to the 
highway network shall be sufficiently identified to indicate 
intersections with existing regionally significant facilities, and to 
determine their effect on route options between transportation analysis 
zones. Each added or modified highway segment shall also be sufficiently 
identified in terms of its design concept and design scope to allow 
modeling of travel times under various traffic volumes, consistent with 
the modeling methods for area-wide transportation analysis in use by the 
MPO. Transit facilities, equipment, and services envisioned for the 
future shall be identified in terms of design concept, design scope, and 
operating policies sufficiently to allow modeling of their transit 
ridership. The description of additions and modifications to the 
transportation network shall also be sufficiently specific to show that 
there is a reasonable relationship between expected land use and the 
envisioned transportation system; and

[[Page 244]]

    (iii) Other future transportation policies, requirements, services, 
and activities, including intermodal activities, shall be described.
    (b) Moderate areas reclassified to serious. Ozone or CO 
nonattainment areas which are reclassified from moderate to serious must 
meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section within two years 
from the date of reclassification.
    (c) Transportation plans for other areas. Transportation plans for 
other areas must meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section 
at least to the extent it has been the previous practice of the MPO to 
prepare plans which meet those requirements. Otherwise, transportation 
plans must describe the transportation system envisioned for the future 
specifically enough to allow determination of conformity according to 
the criteria and procedures of Secs. 93.109 through 93.127.
    (d) Savings. The requirements of this section supplement other 
requirements of applicable law or regulation governing the format or 
content of transportation plans.


<R05>
Sec. 93.107  Relationship of transportation plan and TIP conformity with the NEPA process.

    The degree of specificity required in the transportation plan and 
the specific travel network assumed for air quality modeling do not 
preclude the consideration of alternatives in the NEPA process or other 
project development studies. Should the NEPA process result in a project 
with design concept and scope significantly different from that in the 
transportation plan or TIP, the project must meet the criteria in 
Secs. 93.109 through 93.127 for projects not from a TIP before NEPA 
process completion.


<R05>
Sec. 93.108  Fiscal constraints for transportation plans and TIPs.

    Transportation plans and TIPs must be fiscally constrained 
consistent with DOT's metropolitan planning regulations at 23 CFR part 
450 in order to be found in conformity.


<R05>
Sec. 93.109  Criteria and procedures for determining conformity of transportation plans, programs, and projects: General.

    (a) In order to be found to conform, each transportation plan, 
program, and FHWA/FTA project must satisfy the applicable criteria and 
procedures in Secs. 93.110 through 93.127 as listed in Table 1 in 
paragraph (b) of this section, and must comply with all applicable 
conformity requirements of implementation plans and of court orders for 
the area which pertain specifically to conformity determination 
requirements. The criteria for making conformity determinations differ 
based on the action under review (transportation plans, TIPs, and FHWA/
FTA projects), the time period in which the conformity determination is 
made, and the relevant pollutant.
    (b) The following table indicates the criteria and procedures in 
Secs. 93.110 through 93.127 which apply for each action in each time 
period.

<R05>
Sec. 93.110  Criteria and procedures: Latest planning assumptions.

    (a) The conformity determination, with respect to all other 
applicable criteria in Secs. 93.111 through 93.127, must be based upon 
the most recent planning assumptions in force at the time of the 
conformity determination. This criterion applies during all periods. The 
conformity determination must satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b) 
through (f) of this section.
    (b) Assumptions must be derived from the estimates of current and 
future population, employment, travel, and congestion most recently 
developed by the MPO or other agency authorized to make such estimates 
and approved by the MPO. The conformity determination must also be based 
on the latest assumptions about current and future background 
concentrations.
    (c) The conformity determination for each transportation plan and 
TIP must discuss how transit operating policies (including fares and 
service levels) and assumed transit ridership have changed since the 
previous conformity determination.
    (d) The conformity determination must include reasonable assumptions 
about transit service and increases in transit fares and road and bridge 
tolls over time.
    (e) The conformity determination must use the latest existing 
information regarding the effectiveness of the

[[Page 246]]

TCMs which have already been implemented.
    (f) Key assumptions shall be specified and included in the draft 
documents and supporting materials used for the interagency and public 
consultation required by Sec. 93.105.


<R05>
Sec. 93.111  Criteria and procedures: Latest emissions model.

    (a) The conformity determination must be based on the latest 
emission estimation model available. This criterion applies during all 
periods. It is satisfied if the most current version of the motor 
vehicle emissions model specified by EPA for use in the preparation or 
revision of implementation plans in that State or area is used for the 
conformity analysis. Where EMFAC is the motor vehicle emissions model 
used in preparing or revising the applicable implementation plan, new 
versions must be approved by EPA before they are used in the conformity 
analysis.
    (b) EPA will consult with DOT to establish a grace period following 
the specification of any new model.
    (1) The grace period will be no less than three months and no more 
than 24 months after notice of availability is published in the Federal 
Register.
    (2) The length of the grace period will depend on the degree of 
change in the model and the scope of re-planning likely to be necessary 
by MPOs in order to assure conformity. If the grace period will be 
longer than three months, EPA will announce the appropriate grace period 
in the Federal Register.
    (c) Conformity analyses for which the emissions analysis was begun 
during the grace period or before the Federal Register notice of 
availability of the latest emission model may continue to use the 
previous version of the model for transportation plans and TIPs. The 
previous model may also be used for projects if the analysis was begun 
during the grace period or before the Federal Register notice of 
availability, provided no more than three years have passed since the 
draft environmental document was issued.


<R05>
Sec. 93.112  Criteria and procedures: Consultation.

    The MPO must make the conformity determination according to the 
consultation procedures in this rule and in the implementation plan 
revision required by Sec. 51.396 of this chapter, and according to the 
public involvement procedures established by the MPO in compliance with 
23 CFR part 450. This criterion applies during all periods. Until the 
implementation plan revision required by Sec. 51.396 of this chapter is 
approved by EPA, the conformity determination must be made according to 
the procedures in Secs. 93.105(a)(2) and 93.105(e). Once the 
implementation plan revision has been approved by EPA, this criterion is 
satisfied if the conformity determination is made consistent with the 
implementation plan's consultation requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 93.113  Criteria and procedures: Timely implementation of TCMs.

    (a) The transportation plan, TIP, or FHWA/FTA project which is not 
from a conforming plan and TIP must provide for the timely 
implementation of TCMs from the applicable implementation plan. This 
criterion applies during all periods.
    (b) For transportation plans, this criterion is satisfied if the 
following two conditions are met:
    (1) The transportation plan, in describing the envisioned future 
transportation system, provides for the timely completion or 
implementation of all TCMs in the applicable implementation plan which 
are eligible for funding under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit 
Act, consistent with schedules included in the applicable implementation 
plan.
    (2) Nothing in the transportation plan interferes with the 
implementation of any TCM in the applicable implementation plan.
    (c) For TIPs, this criterion is satisfied if the following 
conditions are met:
    (1) An examination of the specific steps and funding source(s) 
needed to fully implement each TCM indicates that TCMs which are 
eligible for funding under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act 
are on or ahead of the schedule established in the applicable

[[Page 247]]

implementation plan, or, if such TCMs are behind the schedule 
established in the applicable implementation plan, the MPO and DOT have 
determined that past obstacles to implementation of the TCMs have been 
identified and have been or are being overcome, and that all State and 
local agencies with influence over approvals or funding for TCMs are 
giving maximum priority to approval or funding of TCMs over other 
projects within their control, including projects in locations outside 
the nonattainment or maintenance area.
    (2) If TCMs in the applicable implementation plan have previously 
been programmed for Federal funding but the funds have not been 
obligated and the TCMs are behind the schedule in the implementation 
plan, then the TIP cannot be found to conform if the funds intended for 
those TCMs are reallocated to projects in the TIP other than TCMs, or if 
there are no other TCMs in the TIP, if the funds are reallocated to 
projects in the TIP other than projects which are eligible for Federal 
funding under ISTEA's Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement 
Program.
    (3) Nothing in the TIP may interfere with the implementation of any 
TCM in the applicable implementation plan.
    (d) For FHWA/FTA projects which are not from a conforming 
transportation plan and TIP, this criterion is satisfied if the project 
does not interfere with the implementation of any TCM in the applicable 
implementation plan.


<R05>
Sec. 93.114  Criteria and procedures: Currently conforming transportation plan and TIP.

    There must be a currently conforming transportation plan and 
currently conforming TIP at the time of project approval. This criterion 
applies during all periods. It is satisfied if the current 
transportation plan and TIP have been found to conform to the applicable 
implementation plan by the MPO and DOT according to the procedures of 
this subpart.
    (a) Only one conforming transportation plan or TIP may exist in an 
area at any time; conformity determinations of a previous transportation 
plan or TIP expire once the current plan or TIP is found to conform by 
DOT. The conformity determination on a transportation plan or TIP will 
also lapse if conformity is not determined according to the frequency 
requirements of Sec. 93.104.
    (b) This criterion is not required to be satisfied at the time of 
project approval for a TCM specifically included in the applicable 
implementation plan, provided that all other relevant criteria of this 
subpart are satisfied.

[60 FR 57185, Nov. 14, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 93.115  Criteria and procedures: Projects from a plan and TIP.

    (a) The project must come from a conforming plan and program. This 
criterion applies during all periods. If this criterion is not 
satisfied, the project must satisfy all criteria in Table 1 for a 
project not from a conforming transportation plan and TIP. A project is 
considered to be from a conforming transportation plan if it meets the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and from a conforming 
program if it meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. 
Special provisions for TCMs in an applicable implementation plan are 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) A project is considered to be from a conforming transportation 
plan if one of the following conditions applies:
    (1) For projects which are required to be identified in the 
transportation plan in order to satisfy Sec. 93.106, the project is 
specifically included in the conforming transportation plan and the 
project's design concept and scope have not changed significantly from 
those which were described in the transportation plan, or in a manner 
which would significantly impact use of the facility; or
    (2) For projects which are not required to be specifically 
identified in the transportation plan, the project is identified in the 
conforming transportation plan, or is consistent with the policies and 
purpose of the transportation plan and will not interfere with other 
projects specifically included in the transportation plan.
    (c) A project is considered to be from a conforming program if the 
following conditions are met:

[[Page 248]]

    (1) The project is included in the conforming TIP and the design 
concept and scope of the project were adequate at the time of the TIP 
conformity determination to determine its contribution to the TIP's 
regional emissions and have not changed significantly from those which 
were described in the TIP, or in a manner which would significantly 
impact use of the facility; and
    (2) If the TIP describes a project design concept and scope which 
includes project-level emissions mitigation or control measures, written 
commitments to implement such measures must be obtained from the project 
sponsor and/or operator as required by Sec. 93.133(a) in order for the 
project to be considered from a conforming program. Any change in these 
mitigation or control measures that would significantly reduce their 
effectiveness constitutes a change in the design concept and scope of 
the project.
    (d) TCMs. This criterion is not required to be satisfied for TCMs 
specifically included in an applicable implementation plan.

<R05>
Sec. 93.116  Criteria and procedures: Localized CO and PM<INF>10 violations (hot spots).

    (a) The FHWA/FTA project must not cause or contribute to any new 
localized CO or PM<INF>10 violations or increase the frequency or 
severity of any existing CO or PM<INF>10 violations in CO and PM<INF>10 
nonattainment and maintenance areas. This criterion applies during all 
periods. This criterion is satisfied if it is demonstrated that no new 
local violations will be created and the severity or number of existing 
violations will not be increased as a result of the project.
    (b) The demonstration must be performed according to the 
requirements of Secs. 93.105(c)(1)(i) and 93.131.
    (c) For projects which are not of the type identified by 
Sec. 93.131(a) or Sec. 93.131(d), this criterion may be satisfied if 
consideration of local factors clearly demonstrates that no local 
violations presently exist and no new local violations will be created 
as a result of the project. Otherwise, in CO nonattainment and 
maintenance areas, a quantitative demonstration must be performed 
according to the requirements of Sec. 93.131(b).


<R05>
Sec. 93.117  Criteria and procedures: Compliance with PM<INF>10 control measures.

    The FHWA/FTA project must comply with PM<INF>10 control measures in 
the applicable implementation plan. This criterion applies during all 
periods. It is satisfied if control measures (for the purpose of 
limiting PM<INF>10 emissions from the construction activities and/or 
normal use and operation associated with the project) contained in the 
applicable implementation plan are included in the final plans, 
specifications, and estimates for the project.


<R05>
Sec. 93.118  Criteria and procedures: Motor vehicle emissions budget (transportation plan).

    (a) The transportation plan must be consistent with the motor 
vehicle emissions budget(s) in the applicable implementation plan (or 
implementation plan submission). This criterion applies during the 
transitional period and the control strategy and maintenance periods, 
except as provided in Sec. 93.136. This criterion may be satisfied if 
the requirements in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are met:
    (b) A regional emissions analysis shall be performed as follows:
    (1) The regional analysis shall estimate emissions of any of the 
following pollutants and pollutant precursors for which the area is in 
nonattainment or maintenance and for which the applicable implementation 
plan (or implementation plan submission) establishes an emissions 
budget:
    (i) VOC as an ozone precursor;
    (ii) NO<INF>x as an ozone precursor;
    (iii) CO;
    (iv) PM<INF>10 (and its precursors VOC and/or NO<INF>x if the 
applicable implementation plan or implementation plan submission 
identifies transportation-related precursor emissions within the 
nonattainment area as a significant contributor to the PM<INF>10 
nonattainment problem or establishes a budget for such emissions); or
    (v) NO<INF>x (in NO<INF>2 nonattainment or maintenance areas);

[[Page 249]]

    (2) The regional emissions analysis shall estimate emissions from 
the entire transportation system, including all regionally significant 
projects contained in the transportation plan and all other regionally 
significant highway and transit projects expected in the nonattainment 
or maintenance area in the timeframe of the transportation plan;
    (3) The emissions analysis methodology shall meet the requirements 
of Sec. 93.130;
    (4) For areas with a transportation plan that meets the content 
requirements of Sec. 93.106(a), the emissions analysis shall be 
performed for each horizon year. Emissions in milestone years which are 
between the horizon years may be determined by interpolation; and
    (5) For areas with a transportation plan that does not meet the 
content requirements of Sec. 93.106(a), the emissions analysis shall be 
performed for any years in the time span of the transportation plan 
provided they are not more than ten years apart and provided the 
analysis is performed for the last year of the plan's forecast period. 
If the attainment year is in the time span of the transportation plan, 
the emissions analysis must also be performed for the attainment year. 
Emissions in milestone years which are between these analysis years may 
be determined by interpolation.
    (c) The regional emissions analysis shall demonstrate that for each 
of the applicable pollutants or pollutant precursors in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section the emissions are less than or equal to the motor 
vehicle emissions budget as established in the applicable implementation 
plan or implementation plan submission as follows:
    (1) If the applicable implementation plan or implementation plan 
submission establishes emissions budgets for milestone years, emissions 
in each milestone year are less than or equal to the motor vehicle 
emissions budget established for that year;
    (2) For nonattainment areas, emissions in the attainment year are 
less than or equal to the motor vehicle emissions budget established in 
the applicable implementation plan or implementation plan submission for 
that year;
    (3) For nonattainment areas, emissions in each analysis or horizon 
year after the attainment year are less than or equal to the motor 
vehicle emissions budget established by the applicable implementation 
plan or implementation plan submission for the attainment year. If 
emissions budgets are established for years after the attainment year, 
emissions in each analysis year or horizon year must be less than or 
equal to the motor vehicle emissions budget for that year, if any, or 
the motor vehicle emissions budget for the most recent budget year prior 
to the analysis year or horizon year; and
    (4) For maintenance areas, emissions in each analysis or horizon 
year are less than or equal to the motor vehicle emissions budget 
established by the maintenance plan for that year, if any, or the 
emissions budget for the most recent budget year prior to the analysis 
or horizon year.

Sec. 93.119  Criteria and procedures: Motor vehicle emissions budget (TIP).

    (a) The TIP must be consistent with the motor vehicle emissions 
budget(s) in the applicable implementation plan (or implementation plan 
submission). This criterion applies during the transitional period and 
the control strategy and maintenance periods, except as provided in 
Sec. 93.136. This criterion may be satisfied if the requirements in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are met.
    (b) For areas with a conforming transportation plan that fully meets 
the content requirements of Sec. 93.106(a), this criterion may be 
satisfied without additional regional analysis if:
    (1) Each program year of the TIP is consistent with the Federal 
funding which may be reasonably expected for that year, and required 
State/local matching funds and funds for State/local funding-only 
projects are consistent with the revenue sources expected over the same 
period; and
    (2) The TIP is consistent with the conforming transportation plan 
such

[[Page 250]]

that the regional emissions analysis already performed for the plan 
applies to the TIP also. This requires a demonstration that:
    (i) The TIP contains all projects which must be started in the TIP's 
timeframe in order to achieve the highway and transit system envisioned 
by the transportation plan in each of its horizon years;
    (ii) All TIP projects which are regionally significant are part of 
the specific highway or transit system envisioned in the transportation 
plan's horizon years; and
    (iii) The design concept and scope of each regionally significant 
project in the TIP is not significantly different from that described in 
the transportation plan.
    (3) If the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this 
section are not met, then:
    (i) The TIP may be modified to meet those requirements; or
    (ii) The transportation plan must be revised so that the 
requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section are met. 
Once the revised plan has been found to conform, this criterion is met 
for the TIP with no additional analysis except a demonstration that the 
TIP meets the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (c) For areas with a transportation plan that does not meet the 
content requirements of Sec. 93.106(a), a regional emissions analysis 
must meet all of the following requirements:
    (1) The regional emissions analysis shall estimate emissions from 
the entire transportation system, including all projects contained in 
the proposed TIP, the transportation plan, and all other regionally 
significant highway and transit projects expected in the nonattainment 
or maintenance area in the timeframe of the transportation plan;
    (2) The analysis methodology shall meet the requirements of 
Sec. 93.130(c); and
    (3) The regional analysis shall satisfy the requirements of 
Secs. 93.118(b)(1), 93.118(b)(5), and 93.118(c).


<R05>
Sec. 93.120  Criteria and procedures: Motor vehicle emissions budget (project not from a plan and TIP).

    (a) The project which is not from a conforming transportation plan 
and a conforming TIP must be consistent with the motor vehicle emissions 
budget(s) in the applicable implementation plan (or implementation plan 
submission). This criterion applies during the transitional period and 
the control strategy and maintenance periods, except as provided in 
Sec. 93.136. It is satisfied if emissions from the implementation of the 
project, when considered with the emissions from the projects in the 
conforming transportation plan and TIP and all other regionally 
significant projects expected in the area, do not exceed the motor 
vehicle emissions budget(s) in the applicable implementation plan (or 
implementation plan submission).
    (b) For areas with a conforming transportation plan that meets the 
content requirements of Sec. 93.106(a):
    (1) This criterion may be satisfied without additional regional 
analysis if the project is included in the conforming transportation 
plan, even if it is not specifically included in the latest conforming 
TIP. This requires a demonstration that:
    (i) Allocating funds to the project will not delay the 
implementation of projects in the transportation plan or TIP which are 
necessary to achieve the highway and transit system envisioned by the 
transportation plan in each of its horizon years;
    (ii) The project is not regionally significant or is part of the 
specific highway or transit system envisioned in the transportation 
plan's horizon years; and
    (iii) The design concept and scope of the project is not 
significantly different from that described in the transportation plan.
    (2) If the requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are not 
met, a regional emissions analysis must be performed as follows:
    (i) The analysis methodology shall meet the requirements of 
Sec. 93.130;
    (ii) The analysis shall estimate emissions from the transportation 
system, including the proposed project and all other regionally 
significant projects

[[Page 251]]

expected in the nonattainment or maintenance area in the timeframe of 
the transportation plan. The analysis must include emissions from all 
previously approved projects which were not from a transportation plan 
and TIP; and
    (iii) The emissions analysis shall meet the requirements of 
Secs. 93.118(b)(1), 93.118(b)(4), and 93.118(c).
    (c) For areas with a transportation plan that does not meet the 
content requirements of Sec. 93.106(a), a regional emissions analysis 
must be performed for the project together with the conforming TIP and 
all other regionally significant projects expected in the nonattainment 
or maintenance area. This criterion may be satisfied if:
    (1) The analysis methodology meets the requirements of 
Sec. 93.130(c);
    (2) The analysis estimates emissions from the transportation system, 
including the proposed project, and all other regionally significant 
projects expected in the nonattainment or maintenance area in the 
timeframe of the transportation plan; and
    (3) The regional analysis satisfies the requirements of 
Secs. 93.118(b)(1), 93.118(b)(5), and 93.118(c).

Sec. 93.121  Criteria and procedures: Localized CO violations (hot spots) in the interim period.

    (a) Each FHWA/FTA project must eliminate or reduce the severity and 
number of localized CO violations in the area substantially affected by 
the project (in CO nonattainment areas). This criterion applies during 
the interim and transitional periods only. This criterion is satisfied 
with respect to existing localized CO violations if it is demonstrated 
that existing localized CO violations will be eliminated or reduced in 
severity and number as a result of the project.
    (b) The demonstration must be performed according to the 
requirements of Secs. 93.105(c)(1)(i) and 93.131.
    (c) For projects which are not of the type identified by 
Sec. 93.131(a), this criterion may be satisfied if consideration of 
local factors clearly demonstrates that existing CO violations will be 
eliminated or reduced in severity and number. Otherwise, a quantitative 
demonstration must be performed according to the requirements of 
Sec. 93.131(b).

Sec. 93.122  Criteria and procedures: Interim period reductions in ozone and CO areas (transportation plan).

    (a) A transportation plan must contribute to emissions reductions in 
ozone and CO nonattainment areas. This criterion applies during the 
interim and transitional periods only, except as otherwise provided in 
Sec. 93.136. It applies to the net effect on emissions of all projects 
contained in a new or revised transportation plan. This criterion may be 
satisfied if a regional emissions analysis is performed as described in 
paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.
    (b) Determine the analysis years for which emissions are to be 
estimated. Analysis years shall be no more than ten years apart. The 
first analysis year shall be no later than the first milestone year 
(1995 in CO nonattainment areas and 1996 in ozone nonattainment areas). 
The second analysis year shall be either the attainment year for the 
area, or if the attainment year is the same as the first analysis year 
or earlier, the second analysis year shall be at least five years beyond 
the first analysis year. The last year of the transportation plan's 
forecast period shall also be an analysis year.
    (c) Define the `Baseline' scenario for each of the analysis years to 
be the future transportation system that would result from current 
programs, composed of the following (except that projects listed in 
Secs. 93.134 and 93.135 need not be explicitly considered):
    (1) All in-place regionally significant highway and transit 
facilities, services and activities;
    (2) All ongoing travel demand management or transportation system 
management activities; and
    (3) Completion of all regionally significant projects, regardless of 
funding source, which are currently under construction or are undergoing 
right-of-way acquisition (except for hardship acquisition and protective 
buying); come from the first three years of the previously conforming 
transportation plan and/or TIP; or have completed the

[[Page 252]]

NEPA process. (For the first conformity determination on the 
transportation plan after November 24, 1993, a project may not be 
included in the ``Baseline'' scenario if one of the following major 
steps has not occurred within the past three years: NEPA process 
completion; start of final design; acquisition of a significant portion 
of the right-of-way; or approval of the plans, specifications and 
estimates. Such a project must be included in the ``Action'' scenario, 
as described in paragraph (d) of this section.)
    (d) Define the `Action' scenario for each of the analysis years as 
the transportation system that will result in that year from the 
implementation of the proposed transportation plan, TIPs adopted under 
it, and other expected regionally significant projects in the 
nonattainment area. It will include the following (except that projects 
listed in Secs. 93.134 and 93.135 need not be explicitly considered):
    (1) All facilities, services, and activities in the `Baseline' 
scenario;
    (2) Completion of all TCMs and regionally significant projects 
(including facilities, services, and activities) specifically identified 
in the proposed transportation plan which will be operational or in 
effect in the analysis year, except that regulatory TCMs may not be 
assumed to begin at a future time unless the regulation is already 
adopted by the enforcing jurisdiction or the TCM is identified in the 
applicable implementation plan;
    (3) All travel demand management programs and transportation system 
management activities known to the MPO, but not included in the 
applicable implementation plan or utilizing any Federal funding or 
approval, which have been fully adopted and/or funded by the enforcing 
jurisdiction or sponsoring agency since the last conformity 
determination on the transportation plan;
    (4) The incremental effects of any travel demand management programs 
and transportation system management activities known to the MPO, but 
not included in the applicable implementation plan or utilizing any 
Federal funding or approval, which were adopted and/or funded prior to 
the date of the last conformity determination on the transportation 
plan, but which have been modified since then to be more stringent or 
effective;
    (5) Completion of all expected regionally significant highway and 
transit projects which are not from a conforming transportation plan and 
TIP; and
    (6) Completion of all expected regionally significant non-FHWA/FTA 
highway and transit projects that have clear funding sources and 
commitments leading toward their implementation and completion by the 
analysis year.
    (e) Estimate the emissions predicted to result in each analysis year 
from travel on the transportation systems defined by the `Baseline' and 
`Action' scenarios and determine the difference in regional VOC and 
NO<INF>x emissions (unless the Administrator determines that additional 
reductions in NO<INF>x would not contribute to attainment) between the 
two scenarios for ozone nonattainment areas and the difference in CO 
emissions between the two scenarios for CO nonattainment areas. The 
analysis must be performed for each of the analysis years according to 
the requirements of Sec. 93.130. Emissions in milestone years which are 
between the analysis years may be determined by interpolation.
    (f) This criterion is met if the regional VOC and NO<INF>x emissions 
(for ozone nonattainment areas) and CO emissions (for CO nonattainment 
areas) predicted in the `Action' scenario are less than the emissions 
predicted from the `Baseline' scenario in each analysis year, and if 
this can reasonably be expected to be true in the periods between the 
first milestone year and the analysis years. The regional analysis must 
show that the `Action' scenario contributes to a reduction in emissions 
from the 1990 emissions by any nonzero amount.


<R05>
Sec. 93.123  Criteria and procedures: Interim period reductions in ozone and CO areas (TIP).

    (a) A TIP must contribute to emissions reductions in ozone and CO 
nonattainment areas. This criterion applies during the interim and 
transitional periods only, except as otherwise provided in Sec. 93.136. 
It applies to the net

[[Page 253]]

effect on emissions of all projects contained in a new or revised TIP. 
This criterion may be satisfied if a regional emissions analysis is 
performed as described in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.
    (b) Determine the analysis years for which emissions are to be 
estimated. The first analysis year shall be no later than the first 
milestone year (1995 in CO nonattainment areas and 1996 in ozone 
nonattainment areas). The analysis years shall be no more than ten years 
apart. The second analysis year shall be either the attainment year for 
the area, or if the attainment year is the same as the first analysis 
year or earlier, the second analysis year shall be at least five years 
beyond the first analysis year. The last year of the transportation 
plan's forecast period shall also be an analysis year.
    (c) Define the `Baseline' scenario as the future transportation 
system that would result from current programs, composed of the 
following (except that projects listed in Secs. 93.134 and 93.135 need 
not be explicitly considered):
    (1) All in-place regionally significant highway and transit 
facilities, services and activities;
    (2) All ongoing travel demand management or transportation system 
management activities; and
    (3) Completion of all regionally significant projects, regardless of 
funding source, which are currently under construction or are undergoing 
right-of-way acquisition (except for hardship acquisition and protective 
buying); come from the first three years of the previously conforming 
TIP; or have completed the NEPA process. (For the first conformity 
determination on the TIP after November 24, 1993, a project may not be 
included in the ``Baseline'' scenario if one of the following major 
steps has not occurred within the past three years: NEPA process 
completion; start of final design; acquisition of a significant portion 
of the right-of-way; or approval of the plans, specifications and 
estimates. Such a project must be included in the ``Action'' scenario, 
as described in paragraph (d) of this section.)
    (d) Define the `Action' scenario as the future transportation system 
that will result from the implementation of the proposed TIP and other 
expected regionally significant projects in the nonattainment area in 
the timeframe of the transportation plan. It will include the following 
(except that projects listed in Secs. 93.134 and 93.135 need not be 
explicitly considered):
    (1) All facilities, services, and activities in the `Baseline' 
scenario;
    (2) Completion of all TCMs and regionally significant projects 
(including facilities, services, and activities) included in the 
proposed TIP, except that regulatory TCMs may not be assumed to begin at 
a future time unless the regulation is already adopted by the enforcing 
jurisdiction or the TCM is contained in the applicable implementation 
plan;
    (3) All travel demand management programs and transportation system 
management activities known to the MPO, but not included in the 
applicable implementation plan or utilizing any Federal funding or 
approval, which have been fully adopted and/or funded by the enforcing 
jurisdiction or sponsoring agency since the last conformity 
determination on the TIP;
    (4) The incremental effects of any travel demand management programs 
and transportation system management activities known to the MPO, but 
not included in the applicable implementation plan or utilizing any 
Federal funding or approval, which were adopted and/or funded prior to 
the date of the last conformity determination on the TIP, but which have 
been modified since then to be more stringent or effective;
    (5) Completion of all expected regionally significant highway and 
transit projects which are not from a conforming transportation plan and 
TIP; and
    (6) Completion of all expected regionally significant non-FHWA/FTA 
highway and transit projects that have clear funding sources and 
commitments leading toward their implementation and completion by the 
analysis year.
    (e) Estimate the emissions predicted to result in each analysis year 
from travel on the transportation systems defined by the `Baseline' and 
`Action' scenarios, and determine the difference in regional VOC and 
NO<INF>x emissions (unless the Administrator determines that

[[Page 254]]

additional reductions of NO<INF>x would not contribute to attainment) 
between the two scenarios for ozone nonattainment areas and the 
difference in CO emissions between the two scenarios for CO 
nonattainment areas. The analysis must be performed for each of the 
analysis years according to the requirements of Sec. 93.130. Emissions 
in milestone years which are between analysis years may be determined by 
interpolation.
    (f) This criterion is met if the regional VOC and NO<INF>x emissions 
in ozone nonattainment areas and CO emissions in CO nonattainment areas 
predicted in the `Action' scenario are less than the emissions predicted 
from the `Baseline' scenario in each analysis year, and if this can 
reasonably be expected to be true in the period between the analysis 
years. The regional analysis must show that the `Action' scenario 
contributes to a reduction in emissions from the 1990 emissions by any 
nonzero amount.

Sec. 93.124  Criteria and procedures: Interim period reductions for ozone and CO areas (project not from a plan and TIP).

    A transportation project which is not from a conforming 
transportation plan and TIP must contribute to emissions reductions in 
ozone and CO nonattainment areas. This criterion applies during the 
interim and transitional periods only, except as otherwise provided in 
Sec. 93.136. This criterion is satisfied if a regional emissions 
analysis is performed which meets the requirements of Sec. 93.122 and 
which includes the transportation plan and project in the `Action' 
scenario. If the project which is not from a conforming transportation 
plan and TIP is a modification of a project currently in the plan or 
TIP, the `Baseline' scenario must include the project with its original 
design concept and scope, and the `Action' scenario must include the 
project with its new design concept and scope.


<R05>
Sec. 93.125  Criteria and procedures: Interim period reductions for PM<INF>10 and NO<INF>2 areas (transportation plan).

    (a) A transportation plan must contribute to emission reductions or 
must not increase emissions in PM<INF>10 and NO<INF>2 nonattainment 
areas. This criterion applies only during the interim and transitional 
periods. It applies to the net effect on emissions of all projects 
contained in a new or revised transportation plan. This criterion may be 
satisfied if the requirements of either paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section are met.
    (b) Demonstrate that implementation of the plan and all other 
regionally significant projects expected in the nonattainment area will 
contribute to reductions in emissions of PM<INF>10 in a PM<INF>10 
nonattainment area (and of each transportation-related precursor of 
PM<INF>10 in PM<INF>10 nonattainment areas if the EPA Regional 
Administrator or the director of the State air agency has made a finding 
that such precursor emissions from within the nonattainment area are a 
significant contributor to the PM<INF>10 nonattainment problem and has 
so notified the MPO and DOT) and of NO<INF>x in an NO<INF>2 
nonattainment area, by performing a regional emissions analysis as 
follows:
    (1) Determine the analysis years for which emissions are to be 
estimated. Analysis years shall be no more than ten years apart. The 
first analysis year shall be no later than 1996 (for NO<INF>2 areas) or 
four years and six months following the date of designation (for 
PM<INF>10 areas). The second analysis year shall be either the 
attainment year for the area, or if the attainment year is the same as 
the first analysis year or earlier, the second analysis year shall be at 
least five years beyond the first analysis year. The last year of the 
transportation plan's forecast period shall also be an analysis year.
    (2) Define for each of the analysis years the ``Baseline'' scenario, 
as defined in Sec. 93.122(c), and the ``Action'' scenario, as defined in 
Sec. 93.122(d).
    (3) Estimate the emissions predicted to result in each analysis year 
from travel on the transportation systems defined by the ``Baseline'' 
and ``Action'' scenarios and determine the difference between the two 
scenarios in regional PM<INF>10 emissions in a PM<INF>10 nonattainment 
area (and transportation-related precursors of PM<INF>10 in PM<INF>10 
nonattainment areas if the EPA Regional Administrator or the director of 
the State air agency has made a finding that such precursor emissions 
from

[[Page 255]]

within the nonattainment area are a significant contributor to the 
PM<INF>10 nonattainment problem and has so notified the MPO and DOT) and 
in NO<INF>x emissions in an NO<INF>2 nonattainment area. The analysis 
must be performed for each of the analysis years according to the 
requirements of Sec. 93.130. The analysis must address the periods 
between the analysis years and the periods between 1990, the first 
milestone year (if any), and the first of the analysis years. Emissions 
in milestone years which are between the analysis years may be 
determined by interpolation.
    (4) Demonstrate that the regional PM<INF>10 emissions and PM<INF>10 
precursor emissions, where applicable, (for PM<INF>10 nonattainment 
areas) and NO<INF>x emissions (for NO<INF>2 nonattainment areas) 
predicted in the `Action' scenario are less than the emissions predicted 
from the `Baseline' scenario in each analysis year, and that this can 
reasonably be expected to be true in the periods between the first 
milestone year (if any) and the analysis years.
    (c) Demonstrate that when the projects in the transportation plan 
and all other regionally significant projects expected in the 
nonattainment area are implemented, the transportation system's total 
highway and transit emissions of PM<INF>10 in a PM<INF>10 nonattainment 
area (and transportation-related precursors of PM<INF>10 in PM<INF>10 
nonattainment areas if the EPA Regional Administrator or the director of 
the State air agency has made a finding that such precursor emissions 
from within the nonattainment area are a significant contributor to the 
PM<INF>10 nonattainment problem and has so notified the MPO and DOT) and 
of NO<INF>x in an NO<INF>2 nonattainment area will not be greater than 
baseline levels, by performing a regional emissions analysis as follows:
    (1) Determine the baseline regional emissions of PM<INF>10 and 
PM<INF>10 precursors, where applicable (for PM<INF>10 nonattainment 
areas) and NO<INF>x (for NO<INF>2 nonattainment areas) from highway and 
transit sources. Baseline emissions are those estimated to have occurred 
during calendar year 1990, unless the implementation plan revision 
required by Sec. 51.396 of this chapter defines the baseline emissions 
for a PM<INF>10 area to be those occurring in a different calendar year 
for which a baseline emissions inventory was developed for the purpose 
of developing a control strategy implementation plan.
    (2) Estimate the emissions of the applicable pollutant(s) from the 
entire transportation system, including projects in the transportation 
plan and TIP and all other regionally significant projects in the 
nonattainment area, according to the requirements of Sec. 93.130. 
Emissions shall be estimated for analysis years which are no more than 
ten years apart. The first analysis year shall be no later than 1996 
(for NO<INF>2 areas) or four years and six months following the date of 
designation (for PM<INF>10 areas). The second analysis year shall be 
either the attainment year for the area, or if the attainment year is 
the same as the first analysis year or earlier, the second analysis year 
shall be at least five years beyond the first analysis year. The last 
year of the transportation plan's forecast period shall also be an 
analysis year.
    (3) Demonstrate that for each analysis year the emissions estimated 
in paragraph (c)(2) of this section are no greater than baseline 
emissions of PM<INF>10 and PM<INF>10 precursors, where applicable (for 
PM<INF>10 nonattainment areas) or NO<INF>x (for NO<INF>2 nonattainment 
areas) from highway and transit sources.


<R05>
Sec. 93.126  Criteria and procedures: Interim period reductions for PM<INF>10 and NO<INF>2 areas (TIP).

    (a) A TIP must contribute to emission reductions or must not 
increase emissions in PM<INF>10 and NO<INF>2 nonattainment areas. This 
criterion applies only during the interim and transitional periods. It 
applies to the net effect on emissions of all projects contained in a 
new or revised TIP. This criterion may be satisfied if the requirements 
of either paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) of this section are met.
    (b) Demonstrate that implementation of the plan and TIP and all 
other regionally significant projects expected in the nonattainment area 
will contribute to reductions in emissions of PM<INF>10 in a PM<INF>10 
nonattainment area (and transportation-related precursors of PM<INF>10 
in PM<INF>10 nonattainment areas if the EPA Regional Administrator or 
the director of the State air agency has

[[Page 256]]

made a finding that such precursor emissions from within the 
nonattainment area are a significant contributor to the PM<INF>10 
nonattainment problem and has so notified the MPO and DOT) and of 
NO<INF>x in an NO<INF>2 nonattainment area, by performing a regional 
emissions analysis as follows:
    (1) Determine the analysis years for which emissions are to be 
estimated, according to the requirements of Sec. 93.125(b)(1).
    (2) Define for each of the analysis years the ``Baseline'' scenario, 
as defined in Sec. 93.123(c), and the ``Action'' scenario, as defined in 
Sec. 93.123(d).
    (3) Estimate the emissions predicted to result in each analysis year 
from travel on the transportation systems defined by the ``Baseline'' 
and ``Action'' scenarios as required by Sec. 93.125(b)(3), and make the 
demonstration required by Sec. 93.125(b)(4).
    (c) Demonstrate that when the projects in the transportation plan 
and TIP and all other regionally significant projects expected in the 
area are implemented, the transportation system's total highway and 
transit emissions of PM<INF>10 in a PM<INF>10 nonattainment area (and 
transportation-related precursors of PM<INF>10 in PM<INF>10 
nonattainment areas if the EPA Regional Administrator or the director of 
the State air agency has made a finding that such precursor emissions 
from within the nonattainment area are a significant contributor to the 
PM<INF>10 nonattainment problem and has so notified the MPO and DOT) and 
of NO<INF>x in an NO<INF>2 nonattainment area will not be greater than 
baseline levels, by performing a regional emissions analysis as required 
by Sec. 93.125(c) (1) through (3).


<R05>
Sec. 93.127  Criteria and procedures: Interim period reductions for PM<INF>10 and NO<INF>2 areas (project not from a plan and TIP).

    A transportation project which is not from a conforming 
transportation plan and TIP must contribute to emission reductions or 
must not increase emissions in PM<INF>10 and NO<INF>2 nonattainment 
areas. This criterion applies during the interim and transitional 
periods only. This criterion is met if a regional emissions analysis is 
performed which meets the requirements of Sec. 93.125 and which includes 
the transportation plan and project in the `Action' scenario. If the 
project which is not from a conforming transportation plan and TIP is a 
modification of a project currently in the transportation plan or TIP, 
and Sec. 93.125(b) is used to demonstrate satisfaction of this 
criterion, the `Baseline' scenario must include the project with its 
original design concept and scope, and the `Action' scenario must 
include the project with its new design concept and scope.


<R05>
Sec. 93.128  Transition from the interim period to the control strategy period.

    (a) Control strategy implementation plan submissions. (1) The 
transportation plan and TIP must be demonstrated to conform by 18 months 
from the date of the State's initial submission to EPA of each control 
strategy implementation plan establishing a motor vehicle emissions 
budget. If conformity is not determined by 18 months from the date of 
submission of such control strategy implementation plan, the conformity 
status of the transportation plan and TIP will lapse, and no new 
project-level conformity determinations may be made, until the 
transportation plan and TIP have been demonstrated to conform.
    (2) For areas not yet in the control strategy period for a given 
pollutant, conformity shall be demonstrated using the motor vehicle 
emissions budget(s) in a submitted control strategy implementation plan 
revision for that pollutant beginning 90 days after submission, unless 
EPA declares such budget(s) inadequate for transportation conformity 
purposes. The motor vehicle emissions budget(s) may be used to determine 
conformity during the first 90 days after its submission if EPA agrees 
that the budget(s) are adequate for conformity purposes.
    (b) Disapprovals. (1) If EPA disapproves the submitted control 
strategy implementation plan revision and so notifies the State, MPO, 
and DOT, which initiates the sanction process under Clean Air Act 
section 179 or 110(m), the conformity status of the transportation plan 
and TIP shall lapse 120 days after EPA's disapproval, and

[[Page 257]]

no new project-level conformity determinations may be made. No new 
transportation plan, TIP, or project may be found to conform until 
another control strategy implementation plan revision fulfilling the 
same Clean Air Act requirements is submitted and conformity to this 
submission is determined.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if EPA 
disapproves the submitted control strategy implementation plan revision 
but makes a protective finding, the conformity status of the 
transportation plan and TIP shall lapse on the date that highway 
sanctions as a result of the disapproval are imposed on the 
nonattainment area under section 179(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act. No new 
transportation plan, TIP, or project may be found to conform until 
another control strategy implementation plan revision fulfilling the 
same Clean Air Act requirements is submitted and conformity to this 
submission is determined.
    (c) Failure to submit and incompleteness. For areas where EPA 
notifies the State, MPO, and DOT of the State's failure to submit or 
submission of an incomplete control strategy implementation plan 
revision, which initiates the sanction process under Clean Air Act 
sections 179 or 110(m), the conformity status of the transportation plan 
and TIP shall lapse on the date that highway sanctions are imposed on 
the nonattainment area for such failure under section 179(b)(1) of the 
Clean Air Act, unless the failure has been remedied and acknowledged by 
a letter from the EPA Regional Administrator.
    (d) Federal implementation plans. When EPA promulgates a federal 
implementation plan that contains motor vehicle emissions budget(s) as a 
result of a State failure, the conformity lapse imposed by this section 
because of that State failure is removed.
    (e) Projects. If the currently conforming transportation plan and 
TIP have not been demonstrated to conform according to transitional 
period criteria and procedures, the requirements of paragraphs (e) (1) 
and (2) of this section must be met.
    (1) Before a FHWA/FTA project which is regionally significant and 
increases single-occupant vehicle capacity (a new general purpose 
highway on a new location or adding general purpose lanes) may be found 
to conform, the State air agency must be consulted on how the emissions 
which the existing transportation plan and TIP's conformity 
determination estimates for the ``Action'' scenario (as required by 
Secs. 93.122 through 93.127) compare to the motor vehicle emissions 
budget in the implementation plan submission or the projected motor 
vehicle emissions budget in the implementation plan under development.
    (2) In the event of unresolved disputes on such project-level 
conformity determinations, the State air agency may escalate the issue 
to the Governor consistent with the procedure in Sec. 93.105(d), which 
applies for any State air agency comments on a conformity determination.
    (f) Redetermination of conformity of the existing transportation 
plan and TIP according to the transitional period criteria and 
procedures. (1) The redetermination of the conformity of the existing 
transportation plan and TIP according to transitional period criteria 
and procedures (as required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (d)(1) of this 
section) does not require new emissions analysis and does not have to 
satisfy the requirements of Secs. 93.110 and 93.111 if:
    (i) The control strategy implementation plan revision submitted to 
EPA uses the MPO's modeling of the existing transportation plan and TIP 
for its projections of motor vehicle emissions; and
    (ii) The control strategy implementation plan does not include any 
transportation projects which are not included in the transportation 
plan and TIP.
    (2) A redetermination of conformity as described in paragraph (f)(1) 
of this section is not considered a conformity determination for the 
purposes of Sec. 93.104(b)(4) or Sec. 93.104(c)(4) regarding the maximum 
intervals between conformity determinations. Conformity must be 
determined according to all the applicable criteria and procedures of 
Sec. 93.109 within three years of the last determination which did not 
rely on paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
    (g) Nonattainment areas which are not required to demonstrate 
reasonable further progress and attainment. If an area

[[Page 258]]

listed in Sec. 93.136 submits a control strategy implementation plan 
revision, the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (e) of this section 
apply. Because the areas listed in Sec. 93.136 are not required to 
demonstrate reasonable further progress and attainment the provisions of 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section do not apply to these areas.
    (h) Maintenance plans. If a control strategy implementation plan 
revision is not submitted to EPA but a maintenance plan required by 
Clean Air Act section 175A is submitted to EPA, the requirements of 
paragraph (a) or (d) of this section apply, with the maintenance plan 
submission treated as a ``control strategy implementation plan 
revision'' for the purposes of those requirements.

Sec. 93.129  Requirements for adoption or approval of projects by other recipients of funds designated under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act.

    No recipient of federal funds designated under title 23 U.S.C. or 
the Federal Transit Act shall adopt or approve a regionally significant 
highway or transit project, regardless of funding source, unless there 
is a currently conforming transportation plan and TIP consistent with 
the requirements of Sec. 93.114 and the requirements of one of the 
following paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section are met:
    (a) The project comes from a conforming plan and program consistent 
with the requirements of Sec. 93.115;
    (b) The project is included in the regional emissions analysis 
supporting the currently conforming TIP's conformity determination, even 
if the project is not strictly ``included'' in the TIP for the purposes 
of MPO project selection or endorsement, and the project's design 
concept and scope have not changed significantly from those which were 
included in the regional emissions analysis, or in a manner which would 
significantly impact use of the facility;
    (c) During the control strategy or maintenance period, the project 
is consistent with the motor vehicle emissions budget(s) in the 
applicable implementation plan consistent with the requirements of 
Sec. 93.120;
    (d) During Phase II of the interim period, the project contributes 
to emissions reductions or does not increase emissions consistent with 
the requirements of Sec. 93.124 (in ozone and CO nonattainment areas) or 
Sec. 93.127 (in PM<INF>10 and NO<INF>2 nonattainment areas); or
    (e) During the transitional period, the project satisfies the 
requirements of both paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 93.130  Procedures for determining regional transportation-related emissions.

    (a) General requirements. (1) The regional emissions analysis for 
the transportation plan, TIP, or project not from a conforming plan and 
TIP shall include all regionally significant projects expected in the 
nonattainment or maintenance area, including FHWA/FTA projects proposed 
in the transportation plan and TIP and all other regionally significant 
projects which are disclosed to the MPO as required by Sec. 93.105. 
Projects which are not regionally significant are not required to be 
explicitly modeled, but VMT from such projects must be estimated in 
accordance with reasonable professional practice. The effects of TCMs 
and similar projects that are not regionally significant may also be 
estimated in accordance with reasonable professional practice.
    (2) The emissions analysis may not include for emissions reduction 
credit any TCMs which have been delayed beyond the scheduled date(s) 
until such time as implementation has been assured. If the TCM has been 
partially implemented and it can be demonstrated that it is providing 
quantifiable emission reduction benefits, the emissions analysis may 
include that emissions reduction credit.
    (3) Emissions reduction credit from projects, programs, or 
activities which require a regulation in order to be implemented may not 
be included in the emissions analysis unless the regulation is already 
adopted by the enforcing jurisdiction. Adopted regulations are required 
for demand management strategies for reducing emissions which are not 
specifically identified in the

[[Page 259]]

applicable implementation plan, and for control programs which are 
external to the transportation system itself, such as tailpipe or 
evaporative emission standards, limits on gasoline volatility, 
inspection and maintenance programs, and oxygenated or reformulated 
gasoline or diesel fuel. A regulatory program may also be considered to 
be adopted if an opt-in to a Federally enforced program has been 
approved by EPA, if EPA has promulgated the program (if the control 
program is a Federal responsibility, such as tailpipe standards), or if 
the Clean Air Act requires the program without need for individual State 
action and without any discretionary authority for EPA to set its 
stringency, delay its effective date, or not implement the program.
    (4) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(3) of this section, during the 
transitional period, control measures or programs which are committed to 
in an implementation plan submission as described in Secs. 93.118 
through 93.120, but which has not received final EPA action in the form 
of a finding of incompleteness, approval, or disapproval may be assumed 
for emission reduction credit for the purpose of demonstrating that the 
requirements of Secs. 93.118 through 93.120 are satisfied.
    (5) A regional emissions analysis for the purpose of satisfying the 
requirements of Secs. 93.122 through 93.124 may account for the programs 
in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, but the same assumptions about 
these programs shall be used for both the ``Baseline'' and ``Action'' 
scenarios.
    (6) Ambient temperatures shall be consistent with those used to 
establish the emissions budget in the applicable implementation plan. 
Factors other than temperatures, for example the fraction of travel in a 
hot stabilized engine mode, may be modified after interagency 
consultation according to Sec. 93.105 if the newer estimates incorporate 
additional or more geographically specific information or represent a 
logically estimated trend in such factors beyond the period considered 
in the applicable implementation plan.
    (b) Serious, severe, and extreme ozone nonattainment areas and 
serious carbon monoxide areas after January 1, 1995. Estimates of 
regional transportation-related emissions used to support conformity 
determinations must be made according to procedures which meet the 
requirements in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this section.
    (1) A network-based transportation demand model or models relating 
travel demand and transportation system performance to land-use 
patterns, population demographics, employment, transportation 
infrastructure, and transportation policies must be used to estimate 
travel within the metropolitan planning area of the nonattainment area. 
Such a model shall possess the following attributes:
    (i) The modeling methods and the functional relationships used in 
the model(s) shall in all respects be in accordance with acceptable 
professional practice, and reasonable for purposes of emission 
estimation;
    (ii) The network-based model(s) must be validated against ground 
counts for a base year that is not more than 10 years prior to the date 
of the conformity determination. Land use, population, and other inputs 
must be based on the best available information and appropriate to the 
validation base year;
    (iii) For peak-hour or peak-period traffic assignments, a capacity 
sensitive assignment methodology must be used;
    (iv) Zone-to-zone travel times used to distribute trips between 
origin and destination pairs must be in reasonable agreement with the 
travel times which result from the process of assignment of trips to 
network links. Where use of transit currently is anticipated to be a 
significant factor in satisfying transportation demand, these times 
should also be used for modeling mode splits;
    (v) Free-flow speeds on network links shall be based on empirical 
observations;
    (vi) Peak and off-peak travel demand and travel times must be 
provided;
    (vii) Trip distribution and mode choice must be sensitive to 
pricing, where pricing is a significant factor, if the network model is 
capable of such determinations and the necessary information is 
available;

[[Page 260]]

    (viii) The model(s) must utilize and document a logical 
correspondence between the assumed scenario of land development and use 
and the future transportation system for which emissions are being 
estimated. Reliance on a formal land-use model is not specifically 
required but is encouraged;
    (ix) A dependence of trip generation on the accessibility of 
destinations via the transportation system (including pricing) is 
strongly encouraged but not specifically required, unless the network 
model is capable of such determinations and the necessary information is 
available;
    (x) A dependence of regional economic and population growth on the 
accessibility of destinations via the transportation system is strongly 
encouraged but not specifically required, unless the network model is 
capable of such determinations and the necessary information is 
available; and
    (xi) Consideration of emissions increases from construction-related 
congestion is not specifically required.
    (2) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) estimates of 
vehicle miles traveled shall be considered the primary measure of 
vehicle miles traveled within the portion of the nonattainment or 
maintenance area and for the functional classes of roadways included in 
HPMS, for urban areas which are sampled on a separate urban area basis. 
A factor (or factors) shall be developed to reconcile and calibrate the 
network-based model estimates of vehicle miles traveled in the base year 
of its validation to the HPMS estimates for the same period, and these 
factors shall be applied to model estimates of future vehicle miles 
traveled. In this factoring process, consideration will be given to 
differences in the facility coverage of the HPMS and the modeled network 
description. Departure from these procedures is permitted with the 
concurrence of DOT and EPA.
    (3) Reasonable methods shall be used to estimate nonattainment area 
vehicle travel on off-network roadways within the urban transportation 
planning area, and on roadways outside the urban transportation planning 
area.
    (4) Reasonable methods in accordance with good practice must be used 
to estimate traffic speeds and delays in a manner that is sensitive to 
the estimated volume of travel on each roadway segment represented in 
the network model.
    (c) Areas which are not serious, severe, or extreme ozone 
nonattainment areas or serious carbon monoxide areas, or before January 
1, 1995. (1) Procedures which satisfy some or all of the requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section shall be used in all areas not subject to 
paragraph (b) of this section in which those procedures have been the 
previous practice of the MPO.
    (2) Regional emissions may be estimated by methods which do not 
explicitly or comprehensively account for the influence of land use and 
transportation infrastructure on vehicle miles traveled and traffic 
speeds and congestion. Such methods must account for VMT growth by 
extrapolating historical VMT or projecting future VMT by considering 
growth in population and historical growth trends for vehicle miles 
travelled per person. These methods must also consider future economic 
activity, transit alternatives, and transportation system policies.
    (d) Projects not from a conforming plan and TIP in isolated rural 
nonattainment and maintenance areas. This paragraph applies to any 
nonattainment or maintenance area or any portion thereof which does not 
have a metropolitan transportation plan or TIP and whose projects are 
not part of the emissions analysis of any MPO's metropolitan 
transportation plan or TIP (because the nonattainment or maintenance 
area or portion thereof does not contain a metropolitan planning area or 
portion of a metropolitan planning area and is not part of a 
Metropolitan Statistical Area or Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical 
Area which is or contains a nonattainment or maintenance area).
    (1) Conformity demonstrations for projects in these areas may 
satisfy the requirements of Secs. 93.120, 93.124, and 93.127 with one 
regional emissions analysis which includes all the regionally 
significant projects in the nonattainment or maintenance area (or 
portion thereof).
    (2) The requirements of Sec. 93.120 shall be satisfied according to 
the procedures in Sec. 93.120(c), with references to the

[[Page 261]]

``transportation plan'' taken to mean the statewide transportation plan.
    (3) The requirements of Secs. 93.124 and 93.127 which reference 
``transportation plan'' or ``TIP'' shall be taken to mean those projects 
in the statewide transportation plan or statewide TIP which are in the 
nonattainment or maintenance area (or portion thereof).
    (4) The requirement of Sec. 93.129(b) shall be satisfied if:
    (i) The project is included in the regional emissions analysis which 
includes all regionally significant highway and transportation projects 
in the nonattainment or maintenance area (or portion thereof) and 
supports the most recent conformity determination made according to the 
requirements of Secs. 93.120, 93.124, or 93.127 (as modified by 
paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section), as appropriate for the 
time period and pollutant; and
    (ii) The project's design concept and scope have not changed 
significantly from those which were included in the regional emissions 
analysis, or in a manner which would significantly impact use of the 
facility.
    (e) PM<INF>10 from construction-related fugitive dust. (1) For areas 
in which the implementation plan does not identify construction-related 
fugitive PM<INF>10 as a contributor to the nonattainment problem, the 
fugitive PM<INF>10 emissions associated with highway and transit project 
construction are not required to be considered in the regional emissions 
analysis.
    (2) In PM<INF>10 nonattainment and maintenance areas with 
implementation plans which identify construction-related fugitive 
PM<INF>10 as a contributor to the nonattainment problem, the regional 
PM<INF>10 emissions analysis shall consider construction-related 
fugitive PM<INF>10 and shall account for the level of construction 
activity, the fugitive PM<INF>10 control measures in the applicable 
implementation plan, and the dust-producing capacity of the proposed 
activities.

<R05>
Sec. 93.131  Procedures for determining localized CO and PM<INF>10 concentrations (hot-spot analysis).

    (a) In the following cases, CO hot-spot analyses must be based on 
the applicable air quality models, data bases, and other requirements 
specified in 40 CFR part 51, Appendix W (``Guideline on Air Quality 
Models (Revised)'' (1988), supplement A (1987) and supplement B (1993), 
EPA publication no. 450/2-78-027R), unless, after the interagency 
consultation process described in Sec. 93.105 and with the approval of 
the EPA Regional Administrator, these models, data bases, and other 
requirements are determined to be inappropriate:
    (1) For projects in or affecting locations, areas, or categories of 
sites which are identified in the applicable implementation plan as 
sites of current violation or possible current violation;
    (2) For those intersections at Level-of-Service D, E, or F, or those 
that will change to Level-of-Service D, E, or F because of increased 
traffic volumes related to a new project in the vicinity;
    (3) For any project involving or affecting any of the intersections 
which the applicable implementation plan identifies as the top three 
intersections in the nonattainment or maintenance area based on the 
highest traffic volumes;
    (4) For any project involving or affecting any of the intersections 
which the applicable implementation plan identifies as the top three 
intersections in the nonattainment or maintenance area based on the 
worst Level-of-Service; and
    (5) Where use of the ``Guideline'' models is practicable and 
reasonable given the potential for violations.
    (b) In cases other than those described in paragraph (a) of this 
section, other quantitative methods may be used if they represent 
reasonable and common professional practice.
    (c) CO hot-spot analyses must include the entire project, and may be 
performed only after the major design features which will significantly 
impact CO concentrations have been identified. The background 
concentration

[[Page 262]]

can be estimated using the ratio of future to current traffic multiplied 
by the ratio of future to current emission factors.
    (d) PM<INF>10 hot-spot analysis must be performed for projects which 
are located at sites at which violations have been verified by 
monitoring, and at sites which have essentially identical vehicle and 
roadway emission and dispersion characteristics (including sites near 
one at which a violation has been monitored). The projects which require 
PM-10 hot-spot analysis shall be determined through the interagency 
consultation process required in Sec. 93.105. In PM-10 nonattainment and 
maintenance areas, new or expanded bus and rail terminals and transfer 
points which increase the number of diesel vehicles congregating at a 
single location require hot-spot analysis. DOT may choose to make a 
categorical conformity determination on bus and rail terminals or 
transfer points based on appropriate modeling of various terminal sizes, 
configurations, and activity levels. The requirements of this paragraph 
for quantitative hot-spot analysis will not take effect until EPA 
releases modeling guidance on this subject and announces in the Federal 
Register that these requirements are in effect.
    (e) Hot-spot analysis assumptions must be consistent with those in 
the regional emissions analysis for those inputs which are required for 
both analyses.
    (f) PM<INF>10 or CO mitigation or control measures shall be assumed 
in the hot-spot analysis only where there are written commitments from 
the project sponsor and/or operator to the implementation of such 
measures, as required by Sec. 93.133(a).
    (g) CO and PM<INF>10 hot-spot analyses are not required to consider 
construction-related activities which cause temporary increases in 
emissions. Each site which is affected by construction-related 
activities shall be considered separately, using established 
``Guideline'' methods. Temporary increases are defined as those which 
occur only during the construction phase and last five years or less at 
any individual site.


<R05>
Sec. 93.132  Using the motor vehicle emissions budget in the applicable implementation plan (or implementation plan submission).

    (a) In interpreting an applicable implementation plan (or 
implementation plan submission) with respect to its motor vehicle 
emissions budget(s), the MPO and DOT may not infer additions to the 
budget(s) that are not explicitly intended by the implementation plan 
(or submission). Unless the implementation plan explicitly quantifies 
the amount by which motor vehicle emissions could be higher while still 
allowing a demonstration of compliance with the milestone, attainment, 
or maintenance requirement and explicitly states an intent that some or 
all of this additional amount should be available to the MPO and DOT in 
the emission budget for conformity purposes, the MPO may not interpret 
the budget to be higher than the implementation plan's estimate of 
future emissions. This applies in particular to applicable 
implementation plans (or submissions) which demonstrate that after 
implementation of control measures in the implementation plan:
    (1) Emissions from all sources will be less than the total emissions 
that would be consistent with a required demonstration of an emissions 
reduction milestone;
    (2) Emissions from all sources will result in achieving attainment 
prior to the attainment deadline and/or ambient concentrations in the 
attainment deadline year will be lower than needed to demonstrate 
attainment; or
    (3) Emissions will be lower than needed to provide for continued 
maintenance.
    (b) If an applicable implementation plan submitted before November 
24, 1993 demonstrates that emissions from all sources will be less than 
the total emissions that would be consistent with attainment and 
quantifies that ``safety margin,'' the State may submit a SIP revision 
which assigns some or all of this safety margin to highway and transit 
mobile sources for the purposes of conformity. Such a SIP revision, once 
it is endorsed by the Governor and has been subject to a public hearing, 
may be used for the purposes

[[Page 263]]

of transportation conformity before it is approved by EPA.
    (c) A conformity demonstration shall not trade emissions among 
budgets which the applicable implementation plan (or implementation plan 
submission) allocates for different pollutants or precursors, or among 
budgets allocated to motor vehicles and other sources, without a SIP 
revision or a SIP which establishes mechanisms for such trades.
    (d) If the applicable implementation plan (or implementation plan 
submission) estimates future emissions by geographic subarea of the 
nonattainment area, the MPO and DOT are not required to consider this to 
establish subarea budgets, unless the applicable implementation plan (or 
implementation plan submission) explicitly indicates an intent to create 
such subarea budgets for the purposes of conformity.
    (e) If a nonattainment area includes more than one MPO, the SIP may 
establish motor vehicle emissions budgets for each MPO, or else the MPOs 
must collectively make a conformity determination for the entire 
nonattainment area.


<R05>
Sec. 93.133  Enforceability of design concept and scope and project-level mitigation and control measures.

    (a) Prior to determining that a transportation project is in 
conformity, the MPO, other recipient of funds designated under title 23 
U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act, FHWA, or FTA must obtain from the 
project sponsor and/or operator written commitments to implement in the 
construction of the project and operation of the resulting facility or 
service any project-level mitigation or control measures which are 
identified as conditions for NEPA process completion with respect to 
local PM<INF>10 or CO impacts. Before making conformity determinations 
written commitments must also be obtained for project-level mitigation 
or control measures which are conditions for making conformity 
determinations for a transportation plan or TIP and included in the 
project design concept and scope which is used in the regional emissions 
analysis required by Secs. 93.118 through 93.120 and Secs. 93.122-93.124 
or used in the project-level hot-spot analysis required by Secs. 93.116 
and 93.121.
    (b) Project sponsors voluntarily committing to mitigation measures 
to facilitate positive conformity determinations must comply with the 
obligations of such commitments.
    (c) The implementation plan revision required in Sec. 51.396 of this 
chapter shall provide that written commitments to mitigation measures 
must be obtained prior to a positive conformity determination, and that 
project sponsors must comply with such commitments.
    (d) During the control strategy and maintenance periods, if the MPO 
or project sponsor believes the mitigation or control measure is no 
longer necessary for conformity, the project sponsor or operator may be 
relieved of its obligation to implement the mitigation or control 
measure if it can demonstrate that the requirements of Secs. 93.116, 
93.118, and 93.119 are satisfied without the mitigation or control 
measure, and so notifies the agencies involved in the interagency 
consultation process required under Sec. 93.105. The MPO and DOT must 
confirm that the transportation plan and TIP still satisfy the 
requirements of Secs. 93.118 and 93.119 and that the project still 
satisfies the requirements of Sec. 93.116, and therefore that the 
conformity determinations for the transportation plan, TIP, and project 
are still valid.


<R05>
Sec. 93.134  Exempt projects.

    Notwithstanding the other requirements of this subpart, highway and 
transit projects of the types listed in Table 2 are exempt from the 
requirement that a conformity determination be made. Such projects may 
proceed toward implementation even in the absence of a conforming 
transportation plan and TIP. A particular action of the type listed in 
Table 2 is not exempt if the MPO in consultation with other agencies 
(see Sec. 93.105(c)(1)(iii)), the EPA, and the FHWA (in the case of a 
highway project) or the FTA (in the case of a transit project) concur 
that it has potentially adverse emissions impacts for any reason. States 
and MPOs must ensure that exempt projects do not interfere with TCM 
implementation.

Sec. 93.135   Projects exempt from regional emissions analyses.

    Notwithstanding the other requirements of this subpart, highway and 
transit projects of the types listed in Table 3 are exempt from regional 
emissions analysis requirements. The local effects of these projects 
with respect to CO or PM<INF>10 concentrations must be considered to 
determine if a hot-spot analysis is required prior to making a project-
level conformity determination. These projects may then proceed to the 
project development process even in the absence of a conforming 
transportation plan and TIP. A particular action of the type listed in 
Table 3 is not exempt from regional emissions analysis if the MPO in 
consultation with other agencies (see Sec. 93.105(c)(1)(iii)), the EPA, 
and the FHWA (in the case of a highway project) or the FTA (in the case 
of a transit project) concur that it has potential regional impacts for 
any reason.

Sec. 93.136   Special provisions for nonattainment areas which are not required to demonstrate reasonable further progress and attainment.

    (a) Application. This section applies in the following areas:
    (1) Rural transport ozone nonattainment areas;
    (2) Marginal ozone areas;
    (3) Submarginal ozone areas;
    (4) Transitional ozone areas;
    (5) Incomplete data ozone areas;
    (6) Moderate CO areas with a design value of 12.7 ppm or less; and
    (7) Not classified CO areas.
    (b) Default conformity procedures. The criteria and procedures in 
Secs. 93.122 through 93.124 will remain in effect throughout the control 
strategy period for transportation plans, TIPs, and projects (not from a 
conforming plan and TIP) in lieu of the procedures in Secs. 93.118 
through 93.120, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (c) Optional conformity procedures. The State or MPO may voluntarily 
develop an attainment demonstration and corresponding motor vehicle 
emissions budget like those required in areas with higher nonattainment 
classifications. In this case, the State must submit an implementation 
plan revision which contains that budget and attainment demonstration. 
Once EPA has approved this implementation plan revision, the procedures 
in Secs. 93.118 through 93.120 apply in lieu of the procedures in 
Secs. 93.122 through 93.124.

Sec. 93.150  Prohibition.

    (a) No department, agency or instrumentality of the Federal 
Government shall engage in, support in any way or provide financial 
assistance for, license or permit, or approve any activity which does 
not conform to an applicable implementation plan.
    (b) A Federal agency must make a determination that a Federal action 
conforms to the applicable implementation plan in accordance with the 
requirements of this subpart before the action is taken.
    (c) Paragraph (b) of this section does not include Federal actions 
where:
    (1) A National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analysis was 
completed as

[[Page 266]]

evidenced by a final environmental assessment (EA), environmental impact 
statement (EIS), or finding of no significant impact (FONSI) that was 
prepared prior to January 31, 1994; or
    (2)(i) Prior to January 31, 1994, an environmental analysis was 
commenced or a contract was awarded to develop the specific 
environmental analysis;
    (ii) Sufficient environmental analysis is completed by March 15, 
1994 so that the Federal agency may determine that the Federal action is 
in conformity with the specific requirements and the purposes of the 
applicable SIP pursuant to the agency's affirmative obligation under 
section 176(c) of the Clean Air Act (Act); and
    (iii) A written determination of conformity under section 176(c) of 
the Act has been made by the Federal agency responsible for the Federal 
action by March 15, 1994.
    (d) Notwithstanding any provision of this subpart, a determination 
that an action is in conformance with the applicable implementation plan 
does not exempt the action from any other requirements of the applicable 
implementation plan, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), or 
the Clean Air Act (Act).

<R05>
Sec. 93.151  State implementation plan (SIP) revision.

    The Federal conformity rules under this subpart, in addition to any 
existing applicable State requirements, establish the conformity 
criteria and procedures necessary to meet the Act requirements until 
such time as the required conformity SIP revision is approved by EPA. A 
State's conformity provisions must contain criteria and procedures that 
are no less stringent than the requirements described in this subpart. A 
State may establish more stringent conformity criteria and procedures 
only if they apply equally to nonfederal as well as Federal entities. 
Following EPA approval of the State conformity provisions (or a portion 
thereof) in a revision to the applicable SIP, the approved (or approved 
portion of the) State criteria and procedures would govern conformity 
determinations and the Federal conformity regulations contained in this 
part would apply only for the portion, if any, of the State's conformity 
provisions that is not approved by EPA. In addition, any previously 
applicable SIP requirements relating to conformity remain enforceable 
until the State revises its SIP to specifically remove them from the SIP 
and that revision is approved by EPA.


<R05>
Sec. 93.152  Definitions.

    Terms used but not defined in this part shall have the meaning given 
them by the Act and EPA's regulations (40 CFR chapter I), in that order 
of priority.
    Affected Federal land manager means the Federal agency or the 
Federal official charged with direct responsibility for management of an 
area designated as Class I under the Act (42 U.S.C. 7472) that is 
located within 100 km of the proposed Federal action.
    Applicable implementation plan or applicable SIP means the portion 
(or portions) of the SIP or most recent revision thereof, which has been 
approved under section 110 of the Act, or promulgated under section 
110(c) of the Act (Federal implementation plan), or promulgated or 
approved pursuant to regulations promulgated under section 301(d) of the 
Act and which implements the relevant requirements of the Act.
    Areawide air quality modeling analysis means an assessment on a 
scale that includes the entire nonattainment or maintenance area which 
uses an air quality dispersion model to determine the effects of 
emissions on air quality.
    Cause or contribute to a new violation means a Federal action that:
    (1) Causes a new violation of a national ambient air quality 
standard (NAAQS) at a location in a nonattainment or maintenance area 
which would otherwise not be in violation of the standard during the 
future period in question if the Federal action were not taken; or
    (2) Contributes, in conjunction with other reasonably foreseeable 
actions, to a new violation of a NAAQS at a location in a nonattainment 
or maintenance area in a manner that would increase the frequency or 
severity of the new violation.

[[Page 267]]

    Caused by, as used in the terms ``direct emissions'' and ``indirect 
emissions,'' means emissions that would not otherwise occur in the 
absence of the Federal action.
    Criteria pollutant or standard means any pollutant for which there 
is established a NAAQS at 40 CFR part 50.
    Direct emissions means those emissions of a criteria pollutant or 
its precursors that are caused or initiated by the Federal action and 
occur at the same time and place as the action.
    Emergency means a situation where extremely quick action on the part 
of the Federal agencies involved is needed and where the timing of such 
Federal activities makes it impractical to meet the requirements of this 
subpart, such as natural disasters like hurricanes or earthquakes, civil 
disturbances such as terrorist acts and military mobilizations.
    Emissions budgets are those portions of the applicable SIP's 
projected emission inventories that describe the levels of emissions 
(mobile, stationary, area, etc.) that provide for meeting reasonable 
further progress milestones, attainment, and/or maintenance for any 
criteria pollutant or its precursors.
    Emissions offsets, for purposes of Sec. 93.158, are emissions 
reductions which are quantifiable, consistent with the applicable SIP 
attainment and reasonable further progress demonstrations, surplus to 
reductions required by, and credited to, other applicable SIP 
provisions, enforceable at both the State and Federal levels, and 
permanent within the timeframe specified by the program.
    Emissions that a Federal agency has a continuing program 
responsibility for means emissions that are specifically caused by an 
agency carrying out its authorities, and does not include emissions that 
occur due to subsequent activities, unless such activities are required 
by the Federal agency. When an agency, in performing its normal program 
responsibilities, takes actions itself or imposes conditions that result 
in air pollutant emissions by a non-Federal entity taking subsequent 
actions, such emissions are covered by the meaning of a continuing 
program responsibility.
    EPA means the Environmental Protection Agency.
    Federal action means any activity engaged in by a department, 
agency, or instrumentality of the Federal government, or any activity 
that a department, agency or instrumentality of the Federal government 
supports in any way, provides financial assistance for, licenses, 
permits, or approves, other than activities related to transportation 
plans, programs, and projects developed, funded, or approved under title 
23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (49 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.). Where the 
Federal action is a permit, license, or other approval for some aspect 
of a non-Federal undertaking, the relevant activity is the part, 
portion, or phase of the non-Federal undertaking that requires the 
Federal permit, license, or approval.
    Federal agency means, for purposes of this subpart, a Federal 
department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal government.
    Increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation of any 
standard in any area means to cause a nonattainment area to exceed a 
standard more often or to cause a violation at a greater concentration 
than previously existed and/or would otherwise exist during the future 
period in question, if the project were not implemented.
    Indirect emissions means those emissions of a criteria pollutant or 
its precursors that:
    (1) Are caused by the Federal action, but may occur later in time 
and/or may be further removed in distance from the action itself but are 
still reasonably foreseeable; and
    (2) The Federal agency can practicably control and will maintain 
control over due to a continuing program responsibility of the Federal 
agency.
    Local air quality modeling analysis means an assessment of localized 
impacts on a scale smaller than the entire nonattainment or maintenance 
area, including, for example, congested roadway intersections and 
highways or transit terminals, which uses an air quality dispersion 
model to determine the effects of emissions on air quality.
    Maintenance area means an area with a maintenance plan approved 
under section 175A of the Act.

[[Page 268]]

    Maintenance plan means a revision to the applicable SIP, meeting the 
requirements of section 175A of the Act.
    Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) is that organization 
designated as being responsible, together with the State, for conducting 
the continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive planning process under 23 
U.S.C. 134 and 49 U.S.C. 1607.
    Milestone has the meaning given in sections 182(g)(1) and 189(c)(1) 
of the Act.
    National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) are those standards 
established pursuant to section 109 of the Act and include standards for 
carbon monoxide (CO), lead (Pb), nitrogen dioxide (NO<INF>2), ozone, 
particulate matter (PM-10), and sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2).
    NEPA is the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended 
(42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).
    Nonattainment area means an area designated as nonattainment under 
section 107 of the Act and described in 40 CFR part 81.
    Precursors of a criteria pollutant are:
    (1) For ozone, nitrogen oxides (NOx), unless an area is exempted 
from NOx requirements under section 182(f) of the Act, and volatile 
organic compounds (VOC); and
    (2) For PM-10, those pollutants described in the PM-10 nonattainment 
area applicable SIP as significant contributors to the PM-10 levels.
    Reasonably foreseeable emissions are projected future indirect 
emissions that are identified at the time the conformity determination 
is made; the location of such emissions is known and the emissions are 
quantifiable, as described and documented by the Federal agency based on 
its own information and after reviewing any information presented to the 
Federal agency.
    Regional water and/or wastewater projects include construction, 
operation, and maintenance of water or wastewater conveyances, water or 
wastewater treatment facilities, and water storage reservoirs which 
affect a large portion of a nonattainment or maintenance area.
    Regionally significant action means a Federal action for which the 
direct and indirect emissions of any pollutant represent 10 percent or 
more of a nonattainment or maintenance area's emission inventory for 
that pollutant.
    Total of direct and indirect emissions means the sum of direct and 
indirect emissions increases and decreases caused by the Federal action; 
i.e., the ``net'' emissions considering all direct and indirect 
emissions. The portion of emissions which are exempt or presumed to 
conform under Sec. 93.153 (c), (d), (e), or (f) are not included in the 
``total of direct and indirect emissions.'' The ``total of direct and 
indirect emissions'' includes emissions of criteria pollutants and 
emissions of precursors of criteria pollutants.

1601 et seq.) must meet the procedures and criteria of 40 CFR part 51, 
subpart T, in lieu of the procedures set forth in this subpart.
    (b) For Federal actions not covered by paragraph (a) of this 
section, a conformity determination is required for each pollutant where 
the total of direct and indirect emissions in a nonattainment or 
maintenance area caused by a Federal action would equal or exceed any of 
the rates in paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this section.

under the provisions of CERCLA and applicable regulations issued under 
CERCLA.
    (e) Federal actions which are part of a continuing response to an 
emergency or disaster under paragraph (d)(2) of this section and which 
are to be taken more than 6 months after the commencement of the 
response to the emergency or disaster under paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section are exempt from the requirements of this subpart only if:
    (1) The Federal agency taking the actions makes a written 
determination that, for a specified period not to exceed an additional 6 
months, it is impractical to prepare the conformity analyses which would 
otherwise be required and the actions cannot be delayed due to 
overriding concerns for public health and welfare, national security 
interests and foreign policy commitments; or

[[Page 271]]

    (2) For actions which are to be taken after those actions covered by 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Federal agency makes a new 
determination as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (f) Notwithstanding other requirements of this subpart, actions 
specified by individual Federal agencies that have met the criteria set 
forth in either paragraph (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section and the 
procedures set forth in paragraph (h) of this section are presumed to 
conform, except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section.
    (g) The Federal agency must meet the criteria for establishing 
activities that are presumed to conform by fulfilling the requirements 
set forth in either paragraph (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section:
    (1) The Federal agency must clearly demonstrate using methods 
consistent with this subpart that the total of direct and indirect 
emissions from the type of activities which would be presumed to conform 
would not:
    (i) Cause or contribute to any new violation of any standard in any 
area;
    (ii) Interfere with provisions in the applicable SIP for maintenance 
of any standard;
    (iii) Increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation 
of any standard in any area; or
    (iv) Delay timely attainment of any standard or any required interim 
emission reductions or other milestones in any area including, where 
applicable, emission levels specified in the applicable SIP for purposes 
of:
    (A) A demonstration of reasonable further progress;
    (B) A demonstration of attainment; or
    (C) A maintenance plan; or
    (2) The Federal agency must provide documentation that the total of 
direct and indirect emissions from such future actions would be below 
the emission rates for a conformity determination that are established 
in paragraph (b) of this section, based, for example, on similar actions 
taken over recent years.
    (h) In addition to meeting the criteria for establishing exemptions 
set forth in paragraphs (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section, the following 
procedures must also be complied with to presume that activities will 
conform:
    (1) The Federal agency must identify through publication in the 
Federal Register its list of proposed activities that are presumed to 
conform and the basis for the presumptions;
    (2) The Federal agency must notify the appropriate EPA Regional 
Office(s), State and local air quality agencies and, where applicable, 
the agency designated under section 174 of the Act and the MPO and 
provide at least 30 days for the public to comment on the list of 
proposed activities presumed to conform;
    (3) The Federal agency must document its response to all the 
comments received and make the comments, response, and final list of 
activities available to the public upon request; and
    (4) The Federal agency must publish the final list of such 
activities in the Federal Register.
    (i) Notwithstanding the other requirements of this subpart, when the 
total of direct and indirect emissions of any pollutant from a Federal 
action does not equal or exceed the rates specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section, but represents 10 percent or more of a nonattainment or 
maintenance area's total emissions of that pollutant, the action is 
defined as a regionally significant action and the requirements of 
Sec. 93.150 and Secs. 93.155 through 93.160 shall apply for the Federal 
action.
    (j) Where an action otherwise presumed to conform under paragraph 
(f) of this section is a regionally significant action or does not in 
fact meet one of the criteria in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, that 
action shall not be presumed to conform and the requirements of 
Sec. 93.150 and Secs. 93.155 through 93.160 shall apply for the Federal 
action.
    (k) The provisions of this subpart shall apply in all nonattainment 
and maintenance areas.


<R05>
Sec. 93.154  Conformity analysis.

    Any Federal department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal 
government taking an action subject to this subpart must make its own 
conformity determination consistent with the requirements of this 
subpart. In making

[[Page 272]]

its conformity determination, a Federal agency must consider comments 
from any interested parties. Where multiple Federal agencies have 
jurisdiction for various aspects of a project, a Federal agency may 
choose to adopt the analysis of another Federal agency or develop its 
own analysis in order to make its conformity determination.


<R05>
Sec. 93.155  Reporting requirements.

    (a) A Federal agency making a conformity determination under 
Sec. 93.158 must provide to the appropriate EPA Regional Office(s), 
State and local air quality agencies and, where applicable, affected 
Federal land managers, the agency designated under section 174 of the 
Act and the MPO a 30 day notice which describes the proposed action and 
the Federal agency's draft conformity determination on the action.
    (b) A Federal agency must notify the appropriate EPA Regional 
Office(s), State and local air quality agencies and, where applicable, 
affected Federal land managers, the agency designated under section 174 
of the Clean Air Act and the MPO within 30 days after making a final 
conformity determination under Sec. 93.158.


<R05>
Sec. 93.156  Public participation.

    (a) Upon request by any person regarding a specific Federal action, 
a Federal agency must make available for review its draft conformity 
determination under Sec. 93.158 with supporting materials which describe 
the analytical methods and conclusions relied upon in making the 
applicability analysis and draft conformity determination.
    (b) A Federal agency must make public its draft conformity 
determination under Sec. 93.158 by placing a notice by prominent 
advertisement in a daily newspaper of general circulation in the area 
affected by the action and by providing 30 days for written public 
comment prior to taking any formal action on the draft determination. 
This comment period may be concurrent with any other public involvement, 
such as occurs in the NEPA process.
    (c) A Federal agency must document its response to all the comments 
received on its draft conformity determination under Sec. 93.158 and 
make the comments and responses available, upon request by any person 
regarding a specific Federal action, within 30 days of the final 
conformity determination.
    (d) A Federal agency must make public its final conformity 
determination under Sec. 93.158 for a Federal action by placing a notice 
by prominent advertisement in a daily newspaper of general circulation 
in the area affected by the action within 30 days of the final 
conformity determination.


<R05>
Sec. 93.157  Frequency of conformity determinations.

    (a) The conformity status of a Federal action automatically lapses 5 
years from the date a final conformity determination is reported under 
Sec. 93.155, unless the Federal action has been completed or a 
continuous program has been commenced to implement that Federal action 
within a reasonable time.
    (b) Ongoing Federal activities at a given site showing continuous 
progress are not new actions and do not require periodic 
redeterminations so long as such activities are within the scope of the 
final conformity determination reported under Sec. 93.155.
    (c) If, after the conformity determination is made, the Federal 
action is changed so that there is an increase in the total of direct 
and indirect emissions, above the levels in Sec. 93.153(b), a new 
conformity determination is required.


<R05>
Sec. 93.158  Criteria for determining conformity of general Federal actions.

    (a) An action required under Sec. 93.153 to have a conformity 
determination for a specific pollutant, will be determined to conform to 
the applicable SIP if, for each pollutant that exceeds the rates in 
Sec. 93.153(b), or otherwise requires a conformity determination due to 
the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action, the action 
meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, and meets any 
of the following requirements:
    (1) For any criteria pollutant, the total of direct and indirect 
emissions from the action are specifically identified and accounted for 
in the applicable SIP's attainment or maintenance demonstration;

[[Page 273]]

    (2) For ozone or nitrogen dioxide, the total of direct and indirect 
emissions from the action are fully offset within the same nonattainment 
or maintenance area through a revision to the applicable SIP or a 
similarly enforceable measure that effects emission reductions so that 
there is no net increase in emissions of that pollutant;
    (3) For any criteria pollutant, except ozone and nitrogen dioxide, 
the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action meet the 
requirements:
    (i) Specified in paragraph (b) of this section, based on areawide 
air quality modeling analysis and local air quality modeling analysis; 
or
    (ii) Meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this section and, 
for local air quality modeling analysis, the requirement of paragraph 
(b) of this section;
    (4) For CO or PM-10--
    (i) Where the State agency primarily responsible for the applicable 
SIP determines that an areawide air quality modeling analysis is not 
needed, the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action meet 
the requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section, based on 
local air quality modeling analysis; or
    (ii) Where the State agency primarily responsible for the applicable 
SIP determines that an areawide air quality modeling analysis is 
appropriate and that a local air quality modeling analysis is not 
needed, the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action meet 
the requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section, based on 
areawide modeling, or meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this 
section; or
    (5) For ozone or nitrogen dioxide, and for purposes of paragraphs 
(a)(3)(11) and (a)(4)(ii) of this section, each portion of the action or 
the action as a whole meets any of the following requirements:
    (i) Where EPA has approved a revision to an area's attainment or 
maintenance demonstration after 1990 and the State makes a determination 
as provided in paragraph (a)(5)(i)(A) of this section or where the State 
makes a commitment as provided in paragraph (a)(5)(i)(B) of this 
section:
    (A) The total of direct and indirect emissions from the action (or 
portion thereof) is determined and documented by the State agency 
primarily responsible for the applicable SIP to result in a level of 
emissions which, together with all other emissions in the nonattainment 
(or maintenance) area, would not exceed the emissions budgets specified 
in the applicable SIP;
    (B) The total of direct and indirect emissions from the action (or 
portion thereof) is determined by the State agency responsible for the 
applicable SIP to result in a level of emissions which, together with 
all other emissions in the nonattainment (or maintenance) area, would 
exceed an emissions budget specified in the applicable SIP and the State 
Governor or the Governor's designee for SIP actions makes a written 
commitment to EPA which includes the following:
    (1) A specific schedule for adoption and submittal of a revision to 
the SIP which would achieve the needed emission reductions prior to the 
time emissions from the Federal action would occur;
    (2) Identification of specific measures for incorporation into the 
SIP which would result in a level of emissions which, together with all 
other emissions in the nonattainment or maintenance area, would not 
exceed any emissions budget specified in the applicable SIP;
    (3) A demonstration that all existing applicable SIP requirements 
are being implemented in the area for the pollutants affected by the 
Federal action, and that local authority to implement additional 
requirements has been fully pursued;
    (4) A determination that the responsible Federal agencies have 
required all reasonable mitigation measures associated with their 
action; and
    (5) Written documentation including all air quality analyses 
supporting the conformity determination;
    (C) Where a Federal agency made a conformity determination based on 
a State commitment under paragraph (a)(5)(i)(B) of this section, such a 
State commitment is automatically deemed a call for a SIP revision by 
EPA under section 110(k)(5) of the Act, effective on

[[Page 274]]

the date of the Federal conformity determination and requiring response 
within 18 months or any shorter time within which the State commits to 
revise the applicable SIP;
    (ii) The action (or portion thereof), as determined by the MPO, is 
specifically included in a current transportation plan and 
transportation improvement program which have been found to conform to 
the applicable SIP under 40 CFR part 51, subpart T, or 40 CFR part 93, 
subpart A;
    (iii) The action (or portion thereof) fully offsets its emissions 
within the same nonattainment or maintenance area through a revision to 
the applicable SIP or an equally enforceable measure that effects 
emission reductions equal to or greater than the total of direct and 
indirect emissions from the action so that there is no net increase in 
emissions of that pollutant;
    (iv) Where EPA has not approved a revision to the relevant SIP 
attainment or maintenance demonstration since 1990, the total of direct 
and indirect emissions from the action for the future years (described 
in Sec. 93.159(d) do not increase emissions with respect to the baseline 
emissions:
    (A) The baseline emissions reflect the historical activity levels 
that occurred in the geographic area affected by the proposed Federal 
action during:
    (1) Calendar year 1990;
    (2) The calendar year that is the basis for the classification (or, 
where the classification is based on multiple years, the most 
representative year), if a classification is promulgated in 40 CFR part 
81; or
    (3) The year of the baseline inventory in the PM-10 applicable SIP;
    (B) The baseline emissions are the total of direct and indirect 
emissions calculated for the future years (described in Sec. 93.159(d)) 
using the historic activity levels (described in paragraph (a)(5)(iv)(A) 
of this section) and appropriate emission factors for the future years; 
or
    (v) Where the action involves regional water and/or wastewater 
projects, such projects are sized to meet only the needs of population 
projections that are in the applicable SIP.
    (b) The areawide and/or local air quality modeling analyses must:
    (1) Meet the requirements in Sec. 93.159; and
    (2) Show that the action does not:
    (i) Cause or contribute to any new violation of any standard in any 
area; or
    (ii) Increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation of 
any standard in any area.
    (c) Notwithstanding any other requirements of this section, an 
action subject to this subpart may not be determined to conform to the 
applicable SIP unless the total of direct and indirect emissions from 
the action is in compliance or consistent with all relevant requirements 
and milestones contained in the applicable SIP, such as elements 
identified as part of the reasonable further progress schedules, 
assumptions specified in the attainment or maintenance demonstration, 
prohibitions, numerical emission limits, and work practice requirements.
    (d) Any analyses required under this section must be completed, and 
any mitigation requirements necessary for a finding of conformity must 
be identified before the determination of conformity is made.


<R05>
Sec. 93.159  Procedures for conformity determinations of general Federal actions.

    (a) The analyses required under this subpart must be based on the 
latest planning assumptions.
    (1) All planning assumptions must be derived from the estimates of 
population, employment, travel, and congestion most recently approved by 
the MPO, or other agency authorized to make such estimates, where 
available.
    (2) Any revisions to these estimates used as part of the conformity 
determination, including projected shifts in geographic location or 
level of population, employment, travel, and congestion, must be 
approved by the MPO or other agency authorized to make such estimates 
for the urban area.
    (b) The analyses required under this subpart must be based on the 
latest and most accurate emission estimation techniques available as 
described below, unless such techniques are inappropriate. If such 
techniques are inappropriate and written approval of the

[[Page 275]]

EPA Regional Administrator is obtained for any modification or 
substitution, they may be modified or another technique substituted on a 
case-by-case basis or, where appropriate, on a generic basis for a 
specific Federal agency program.
    (1) For motor vehicle emissions, the most current version of the 
motor vehicle emissions model specified by EPA and available for use in 
the preparation or revision of SIPs in that State must be used for the 
conformity analysis as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of 
this section:
    (i) The EPA must publish in the Federal Register a notice of 
availability of any new motor vehicle emissions model; and
    (ii) A grace period of 3 months shall apply during which the motor 
vehicle emissions model previously specified by EPA as the most current 
version may be used. Conformity analyses for which the analysis was 
begun during the grace period or no more than 3 years before the Federal 
Register notice of availability of the latest emission model may 
continue to use the previous version of the model specified by EPA.
    (2) For non-motor vehicle sources, including stationary and area 
source emissions, the latest emission factors specified by EPA in the 
``Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors (AP-42)'' \1\ must be 
used for the conformity analysis unless more accurate emission data are 
available, such as actual stack test data from stationary sources which 
are part of the conformity analysis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Copies may be obtained from the Technical Support Division of 
OAQPS, EPA, MD-14, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) The air quality modeling analyses required under this subpart 
must be based on the applicable air quality models, data bases, and 
other requirements specified in the most recent version of the 
``Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised)'' (1986), including 
supplements (EPA publication no. 450/2-78-027R) \2\, unless:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See footnote 1 at Sec. 93.159(b)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) The guideline techniques are inappropriate, in which case the 
model may be modified or another model substituted on a case-by-case 
basis or, where appropriate, on a generic basis for a specific Federal 
agency program; and
    (2) Written approval of the EPA Regional Administrator is obtained 
for any modification or substitution.
    (d) The analyses required under this subpart, except 
Sec. 93.158(a)(1), must be based on the total of direct and indirect 
emissions from the action and must reflect emission scenarios that are 
expected to occur under each of the following cases:
    (1) The Act mandated attainment year or, if applicable, the farthest 
year for which emissions are projected in the maintenance plan;
    (2) The year during which the total of direct and indirect emissions 
from the action is expected to be the greatest on an annual basis; and
    (3) Any year for which the applicable SIP specifies an emissions 
budget.


<R05>
Sec. 93.160  Mitigation of air quality impacts.

    (a) Any measures that are intended to mitigate air quality impacts 
must be identified and the process for implementation and enforcement of 
such measures must be described, including an implementation schedule 
containing explicit timelines for implementation.
    (b) Prior to determining that a Federal action is in conformity, the 
Federal agency making the conformity determination must obtain written 
commitments from the appropriate persons or agencies to implement any 
mitigation measures which are identified as conditions for making 
conformity determinations.
    (c) Persons or agencies voluntarily committing to mitigation 
measures to facilitate positive conformity determinations must comply 
with the obligations of such commitments.
    (d) In instances where the Federal agency is licensing, permitting 
or otherwise approving the action of another governmental or private 
entity, approval by the Federal agency must be conditioned on the other 
entity meeting the mitigation measures set forth in the conformity 
determination.
    (e) When necessary because of changed circumstances, mitigation

[[Page 276]]

measures may be modified so long as the new mitigation measures continue 
to support the conformity determination. Any proposed change in the 
mitigation measures is subject to the reporting requirements of 
Sec. 93.156 and the public participation requirements of Sec. 93.157.
    (f) The implementation plan revision required in Sec. 93.151 shall 
provide that written commitments to mitigation measures must be obtained 
prior to a positive conformity determination and that such commitments 
must be fulfilled.
    (g) After a State revises its SIP to adopt its general conformity 
rules and EPA approves that SIP revision, any agreements, including 
mitigation measures, necessary for a conformity determination will be 
both State and federally enforceable. Enforceability through the 
applicable SIP will apply to all persons who agree to mitigate direct 
and indirect emissions associated with a Federal action for a conformity 
determination.

<R05>
Sec. 104.3   Notice of hearing; objection; public comment.

    (a) Notice of hearing. Whenever the Administrator publishes any 
proposed effluent standard, he shall simultaneously publish a notice of 
a public hearing to be held within thirty days following the date of 
publication of the proposed standard. Any person who has any objection 
to a proposed standard may file with the hearing clerk a concise 
statement of any such objection. No person may participate in the 
hearing on the proposed toxic pollutant effluent standards unless the 
hearing clerk has received within 25 days of the publication of the 
notice of the proposed standards a statement of objection as herein 
described. In exceptional circumstances and for good cause shown the 
Presiding Officer may allow an objection to be filed after the filing 
deadline prescribed in the preceding sentence, which good cause must 
include at a minimum lack of actual notice on the part of the objector 
or any representative of such objector of the proposed standards despite 
his exercise of due diligence, so long as such later filing will not 
cause undue delay in the proceedings or prejudice to any of the parties.
    (b) Objections. Any objection to a proposed standard which is filed 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall meet the following 
requirements:
    (1) It shall be filed in triplicate with the hearing clerk within 
the time prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section;
    (2) It shall state concisely and with particularity each portion of 
the proposed standard to which objection is taken; to the greatest 
extent feasible it shall state the basis for such objection;
    (3) To the greatest extent feasible it shall (i) state specifically 
the objector's proposed modification to any such standard proposed by 
the Agency to which objection is taken, (ii) set forth the reasons why 
such modification is sought, and (iii) identify and describe the 
scientific or other basis for such proposed modification, including 
reference to any pertinent scientific data or authority in support 
thereof.

Any objection which fails to comply with the foregoing provisions shall 
not be accepted for filing. The Presiding Officer shall promptly notify 
any person whose objection is not accepted for any of the reasons set 
forth in this section, stating the reasons therefor.
    (c) Data in support of objection or modification. In the event that 
the time prescribed for filing objections pursuant to paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section is insufficient to permit an objecting party to 
fully set forth with such objection the basis therefor together with the 
information and data specified in paragraph (b) (3) of this section, he 
may so state at the time of the filing of such objection, and file a 
more complete statement of such basis, information, and data 
(hereinafter referred to as ``supplemental data'') within the time 
prescribed by this paragraph (c). The supplemental data herein described 
shall be filed not later than 40 days following publication of the 
proposed effluent standards.
    (d) Public comment. The notice required under paragraph (a) of this 
section shall also provide for the submission to the Agency of written 
comments on the proposed rulemaking by interested persons not filing 
objections pursuant to this section as hereinabove

[[Page 280]]

described, and hence not participating in the hearing as parties. The 
notice shall fix a time deadline for the submission of such comments 
which shall be not later than the date set for commencement of the 
hearing. Such comments shall be received in evidence at the commencement 
of the hearing. The Administrator in making any decision based upon the 
record shall take into account the unavailability of cross-examination 
in determining the weight to be accorded such comments.
    (e) Promulgation in absence of objection. If no objection is filed 
pursuant to this section, then the Administrator shall promulgate the 
final standards on the basis of the Agency's statement of basis and 
purpose and any public comments received pursuant to paragraph (d) of 
this section.


<R05>
Sec. 104.4   Statement of basis and purpose.

    Whenever the Administrator publishes a proposed effluent standard, 
the notice thereof published in the Federal Register shall include a 
statement of the basis and purpose of the standard or a summary thereof. 
This statement shall include:
    (a) The purpose of the proposed standard;
    (b) An explanation of how the proposed standard was derived;
    (c) Scientific and technical data and studies supporting the 
proposed standard or references thereto if the materials are published 
or otherwise readily available; and
    (d) Such other information as may be reasonably required to set 
forth fully the basis of the standard.

Where the notice of the proposed rulemaking summarizes the full 
statement of basis and purpose, or incorporates documents by reference, 
the documents thus summarized or incorporated by reference shall 
thereupon be made available by the Agency for inspection and copying by 
any interested person.


<R05>
Sec. 104.5   Docket and record.

    Whenever the Administrator publishes a notice of hearing under this 
part, the hearing clerk shall promptly establish a docket for the 
hearing. The docket shall include all written objections filed by any 
party, any public comments received pursuant to Sec. 104.3(d), a 
verbatim transcript of the hearing, the statement of basis and purpose 
required by Sec. 104.4, and any supporting documents referred to 
therein, and other documents of exhibits that may be received in 
evidence or marked for identification by or at the direction of the 
Presiding Officer, or filed by any party in connection with the hearing. 
Copies of documents in the docket shall be available to any person upon 
payment to the Agency of such charges as the Agency may prescribe to 
cover the costs of duplication. The materials contained in the docket 
shall constitute the record.


<R05>
Sec. 104.6   Designation of Presiding Officer.

    The Chief Administrative Law Judge of the Agency may preside 
personally at any hearing under this part, or he may designate another 
Administrative Law Judge as Presiding Officer for the hearing. In the 
event of the unavailability of any such Administrative Law Judge, the 
Administrator may designate a Presiding Officer. No person who has any 
personal pecuniary interest in the outcome of a proceeding under this 
part, or who has participated in the development or enforcement of any 
standard or proposed standard at issue in a proceeding hereunder, shall 
serve as Presiding Officer in such proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 104.7   Powers of Presiding Officer.

    The Presiding Officer shall have the duty to conduct a fair hearing 
within the time constraints imposed by section 307(a) of the Act. He 
shall take all necessary action to avoid delay and to maintain order. He 
shall have all powers necessary to these ends, including but not limited 
to the power to:
    (a) Rule upon motions and requests;
    (b) Change the time and place of the hearing, and adjourn the 
hearing from time to time or from place to place;
    (c) Examine and cross-examine witnesses;
    (d) Admit or exclude evidence; and
    (e) Require any part or all of the evidence to be submitted in 
writing and by a certain date.


[[Page 281]]




<R05>
Sec. 104.8   Prehearing conferences.

    Prehearing conferences are encouraged for the purposes of 
simplification of issues, identification and scheduling of evidence and 
witnesses, the establishment of an orderly framework for the 
proceedings, the expediting of the hearing, and such other purposes of a 
similar nature as may be appropriate.
    (a) The Presiding Officer on his own motion may, and at the request 
of any party made within 20 days of the proposal of standards hereunder 
shall, direct all parties to appear at a specified time and place for an 
initial hearing session in the nature of a prehearing conference. 
Matters taken up at the conference may include, without limitation:
    (1) Consideration and simplification of any issues of law or fact;
    (2) Identification, advance submission, marking for identification, 
consideration of any objections to admission, and admission of 
documentary evidence;
    (3) Possible stipulations of fact;
    (4) The identification of each witness expected to be called by each 
party, and the nature and substance of his expected testimony;
    (5) Scheduling of witnesses where practicable, and limitation of the 
number of witnesses where appropriate in order to avoid delay or 
repetition;
    (6) If desirable, the segregation of the hearing into separate 
segments for different provisions of the proposed effluent standards and 
the establishment of separate service lists;
    (7) Encouragement of objecting parties to agree upon and designate 
lead counsel for objectors with common interests so as to avoid 
repetitious questioning of witnesses.
    (b) The Presiding Officer may, following a prehearing conference, 
issue an order setting forth the agreements reached by the parties or 
representatives, the schedule of witnesses, and a statement of issues 
for the hearing. In addition such order may direct the parties to file 
and serve copies of documents or materials, file and serve lists of 
witnesses which may include a short summary of the expected testimony of 
each and, in the case of an expert witness, his curriculum vitae, and 
may contain such other directions as may be appropriate to facilitate 
the proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 104.9   Admission of evidence.

    (a) Where the Presiding Officer has directed identification of 
witnesses and production of documentation evidence by a certain date, 
the Presiding Officer may exclude any such evidence, or refuse to allow 
any witness to testify, when the witness was not identified or the 
document was not served by the time set by the Presiding Officer. Any 
such direction with respect to a party's case in chief shall not 
preclude the use of such evidence or testimony on rebuttal or response, 
or upon a showing satisfactory to the Presiding Officer that good cause 
existed for failure to serve testimony or a document or identify a 
witness by the time required. The Presiding Officer may require direct 
testimony to be in writing under oath and served by a certain date, and 
may exclude testimony not so served.
    (b) At the first prehearing conference, or at another time before 
the beginning of the taking of oral testimony to be set by the Presiding 
Officer, the statement of basis and purpose, together with any 
publications or reference materials cited therein, except where excluded 
by stipulation, shall be received in evidence.
    (c) The Presiding Officer may exclude evidence which is immaterial, 
irrelevant, unduly repetitious or cumulative, or would involve undue 
delay, or which, if hearsay, is not of the sort upon which responsible 
persons are accustomed to rely.
    (d) If relevant and material evidence is contained in a report or 
document containing immaterial or irrelevant matter, such immaterial or 
irrelevant matter may be excluded.
    (e) Whenever written testimony or a document or object is excluded 
from evidence by the Presiding Officer, it shall at the request of the 
proponent be marked for identification. Where oral testimony is 
permitted by the Presiding Officer, but the Presiding Officer excludes 
particular oral testimony, the party offering such testimony may make a 
brief offer of proof.
    (f) Any relevant and material documentary evidence, including but 
not

[[Page 282]]

limited to affidavits, published articles, and official documents, 
regardless of the availability of the affiant or author for cross-
examination, may be admitted in evidence, subject to the provisions of 
paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) of this section. The availability or 
nonavailability of cross-examination shall be considered as affecting 
the weight to be accorded such evidence in any decision based upon the 
record.
    (g) Official notice may be taken by the Presiding Officer or the 
Administrator of any matter which could be judicially noticed in the 
United States District Courts, and of other facts within the specialized 
knowledge and experience of the Agency. Opposing parties shall be given 
adequate opportunity to show the contrary.


<R05>
Sec. 104.10   Hearing procedures.

    (a) Following the admission in evidence of the materials described 
in Sec. 104.9(b), the Agency shall have the right at the commencement of 
the hearing to supplement that evidence or to introduce additional 
relevant evidence. Thereafter the evidence of each objector shall be 
presented in support of its objection and any proposed modification. The 
Agency staff shall then be given an opportunity to rebut or respond to 
the objectors' presentation, including at its option the introduction of 
evidence which tends to support a standard or standards other than as 
set forth in the Agency's own initially proposed standards. In the event 
that evidence which tends to support such other standard or standards is 
offered and received in evidence, then the objectors may thereafter 
rebut or respond to any such new evidence.
    (b) The burden of proof as to any modification of any standard 
proposed by the Agency shall be upon the party who advocates such 
modification to show that the proposed modification is justified based 
upon a preponderance of the evidence.
    (c) Where necessary in order to prevent undue prolongation of the 
hearing, or to comply with time limitations set forth in the Act, the 
Presiding Officer may limit the number of witnesses who may testify, and 
the scope and extent of cross-examination.
    (d) A verbatim transcript of the hearing shall be maintained and 
shall constitute a part of the record.
    (e) If a party objects to the admission or rejection of any evidence 
or to any other ruling of the Presiding Officer during the hearing, he 
shall state briefly the grounds of such objection. With respect to any 
ruling on evidence, it shall not be necessary for any party to claim an 
exception in order to preserve any right of subsequent review.
    (f) Any party may at any time withdraw his objection to a proposed 
effluent standard.


<R05>
Sec. 104.11   Briefs and findings of fact.

    At the conclusion of the hearing, the Presiding Officer shall set a 
schedule for the submission by the parties of briefs and proposed 
findings of fact and conclusions. In establishing the aforesaid time 
schedule, the Presiding Officer shall consider the time constraints 
placed upon the parties and the Administrator by the statutory 
deadlines.


<R05>
Sec. 104.12   Certification of record.

    As soon as possible after the hearing, the Presiding Officer shall 
transmit to the hearing clerk the transcript of the testimony and 
exhibits introduced in the hearing. The Presiding Officer shall attach 
to the original transcript his certificate stating that, to the best of 
his knowledge and belief, the transcript is a true transcript of the 
testimony given at the hearing except in such particulars as he shall 
specify, and that the exhibits transmitted are all the exhibits as 
introduced at the hearing with such exceptions as he shall specify.


<R05>
Sec. 104.13   Interlocutory and post-hearing review of rulings of the Presiding Officer; motions.

    (a) The Presiding Officer may certify a ruling for interlocutory 
review by the Administrator where a party so requests and the Presiding 
Officer concludes that (1) the ruling from which review is sought 
involves an important question as to which there is substantial ground 
for difference of opinion, and (2) either (i) a subsequent reversal of 
his ruling would be likely to result in substantial delay or expense if 
left

[[Page 283]]

to the conclusion of the proceedings, or (ii) a ruling on the question 
by the Administrator would be of material assistance in expediting the 
hearing. The certificate shall be in writing and shall specify the 
material relevant to the ruling certified. If the Administrator 
determines that interlocutory review is not warranted, he may decline to 
consider the ruling which has been certified.
    (b) Where the Presiding Officer declines to certify a ruling the 
party who had requested certification may apply to the Administrator for 
interlocutory review, or the Administrator may on his own motion direct 
that any matter be submitted to him for review, subject to the standards 
for review set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. An application 
for review shall be in writing and shall briefly state the grounds 
relied on. If the Administrator takes no action with respect to such 
application for interlocutory review within 15 days of its filing, such 
application shall be deemed to have been denied.
    (c) Unless otherwise ordered by the Presiding Officer or the 
Administrator, the hearing shall continue pending consideration by the 
Administrator of any ruling or request for interlocutory review.
    (d) Unless otherwise ordered by the Presiding Officer or the 
Administrator, briefs in response to any application for interlocutory 
review may be filed by any party within five days of the filing of the 
application for review.
    (e) Failure to request or obtain interlocutory review does not waive 
the rights of any party to complain of a ruling following completion of 
the hearing. Within five days following the close of a hearing under 
this part, any party may apply to the Administrator for post-hearing 
review of any procedural ruling, or any ruling made by the Presiding 
Officer concerning the admission or exclusion of evidence to which 
timely objection was made. Within seven days following the filing of any 
such application any other party may file a brief in response thereto.
    (f) If the Administrator on review under paragraph (e) of this 
section determines that evidence was improperly excluded, he may order 
its admission without remand for further proceedings, or may remand with 
such instructions as he deems appropriate concerning cross-examination, 
or opportunity for any party to submit further evidence, with respect to 
such evidence as he directs should be admitted. In making his 
determination whether to remand, the Administrator shall consider 
whether the statutory time restraints permit a remand, and whether it 
would be constructive to allow cross-examination or further evidence 
with respect to the newly admitted evidence. If evidence is admitted 
without cross-examination, the Administrator shall consider the lack of 
opportunity for cross-examination in determining the weight to be given 
such evidence.
    (g) Motions shall be brief, in writing, and may be filed at any time 
following the publication of the proposed effluent standards, unless 
otherwise ordered by the Presiding Officer or the Administrator. Unless 
otherwise ordered or provided in these rules, responses to motions may 
be filed within seven days of the actual filing of the motion with the 
hearing clerk.


<R05>
Sec. 104.14   Tentative and final decision by the Administrator.

    (a) As soon as practicable following the certification of the record 
and the filing by the parties of briefs and proposed findings of fact 
and conclusions under Sec. 104.11, the Administrator, with such staff 
assistance as he deems necessary and appropriate, shall review the 
entire record and prepare and file a tentative decision based thereon. 
The tentative decision shall include findings of fact and conclusions, 
and shall be filed with the hearing clerk who shall at once transmit a 
copy thereof to each party who participated at the hearing, or his 
attorney or other representative.
    (b) Upon filing of the tentative decision, the Administrator may 
allow a reasonable time for the parties to file with him any exceptions 
to the tenative decision, a brief in support of such exceptions 
containing appropriate references to the record, and any proposed 
changes in the tentative decision. Such materials shall, upon 
submission, become part of the record. As soon as practicable after the 
filing

[[Page 284]]

thereof the Administrator shall prepare and file a final decision, 
copies of which shall be transmitted to the parties or their 
representatives in the manner prescribed in paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) In the event that the Administrator determines that due and 
timely execution of his functions, including compliance with time 
limitations established by law, imperatively and unavoidably so 
requires, he may omit the preparation and filing of the tentative 
decision and related procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this 
section, and shall instead prepare and file a final decision, copies of 
which shall be transmitted to the parties or their representatives in 
the manner prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) Any decision rendered by the Administrator pursuant to this 
section shall include a statement of his findings and conclusions, and 
the reasons and basis therefor, and shall indicate the toxic pollutant 
effluent standard or standards which the Administrator is promulgating 
or intends to promulgate based thereon.


<R05>
Sec. 104.15   Promulgation of standards.

    Upon consideration of the record, at the time of his final decision 
the Administrator shall determine whether the proposed effluent standard 
or standards should be promulgated as proposed, or whether any 
modification thereof is justified based upon a proponderance of the 
evidence adduced at the hearing, regardless of whether or not such 
modification was actually proposed by any objecting party. If he 
determines that a modification is not justified, he shall promulgate the 
standard or standards as proposed. If he determines that a modification 
is justified, he shall promulgate a standard or standards as so 
modified.


<R05>
Sec. 104.16   Filing and time.

    (a) All documents or papers required or authorized by the foregoing 
provisions of this part including, but not limited to, motions, 
applications for review, and briefs, shall be filed in duplicate with 
the hearing clerk, except as otherwise expressly provided in these 
rules. Any document or paper so required or authorized to be filed with 
the hearing clerk, if it is filed during the course of the hearing, 
shall be also filed with the Presiding Officer. A copy of each document 
or paper filed by any party with the Presiding Officer, with the hearing 
clerk, or with the Administrator shall be served upon all other parties, 
except to the extent that the list of parties to be so served may be 
modified by order of the Presiding Officer, and each such document or 
paper shall be accompanied by a certificate of such service.
    (b) A party may be represented in any proceeding under this part by 
an attorney or other authorized representative. When any document or 
paper is required under these rules to be served upon a party such 
service shall be made upon such attorney or other representative.
    (c) Except where these rules or an order of the Presiding Officer 
require receipt of a document by a certain date, any document or paper 
required or authorized to be filed by this part shall be deemed to be 
filed when postmarked, or in the case of papers delivered other than by 
mail, when received by the hearing clerk.
    (d) Sundays and legal holidays shall be included in computing the 
time allowed for the filing of any document or paper, provided, that 
when such time expires on a Sunday or legal holiday, such period shall 
be extended to include the next following business day.

<R05>
Sec. 109.1   Applicability.

    The criteria in this part are provided to assist State, local and 
regional agencies in the development of oil removal contingency plans 
for the inland navigable waters of the United States and all areas other 
than the high seas, coastal and contiguous zone waters, coastal and 
Great Lakes ports and harbors and such other areas as may be agreed upon 
between the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of 
Transportation in accordance with section 11(j)(1)(B) of the Federal 
Act, Executive Order No. 11548 dated July 20, 1970 (35 FR 11677) and 
Sec. 306.2 of the National Oil and Hazardous Materials Pollution 
Contingency Plan (35 FR 8511).


<R05>
Sec. 109.2   Definitions.

    As used in these guidelines, the following terms shall have the 
meaning indicated below:
    (a) Oil means oil of any kind or in any form, including, but not 
limited to, petroleum, fuel oil, sludge, oil refuse, and oil mixed with 
wastes other than dredged spoil.
    (b) Discharge includes, but is not limited to, any spilling, 
leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying, or dumping.
    (c) Remove or removal refers to the removal of the oil from the 
water and shorelines or the taking of such other actions as may be 
necessary to minimize or mitigate damage to the public health or 
welfare, including, but not limited to, fish, shellfish, wildlife, and 
public and private property, shorelines, and beaches.
    (d) Major disaster means any hurricane, tornado, storm, flood, high 
water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, earthquake, drought, fire, or 
other catastrophe in any part of the United States which, in the 
determination of the President, is or threatens to become of sufficient 
severity and magnitude to warrant disaster assistance by the Federal 
Government to supplement the efforts and available resources of States 
and local governments and relief organizations in alleviating the 
damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused thereby.
    (e) United States means the States, the District of Columbia, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Canal Zone, Guam, American Samoa, the 
Virgin Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.

development and implementation of State, local, and regional contingency 
plans by State and local governments in consultation with private 
interests to insure timely, efficient, coordinated and effective action 
to minimize damage

[[Page 287]]

resulting from oil discharges. Such plans will be directed toward the 
protection of the public health or welfare of the United States, 
including, but not limited to, fish, shellfish, wildlife, and public and 
private property, shorelines, and beaches. The development and 
implementation of such plans shall be consistent with the National Oil 
and Hazardous Materials Pollution Contingency Plan. State, local and 
regional oil removal contingency plans shall provide for the 
coordination of the total response to an oil discharge so that 
contingency organizations established thereunder can function 
independently, in conjunction with each other, or in conjunction with 
the National and Regional Response Teams established by the National Oil 
and Hazardous Materials Pollution Contingency Plan.


<R05>
Sec. 109.4   Relationship to Federal response actions.

    The National Oil and Hazardous Materials Pollution Contingency Plan 
provides that the Federal on-scene commander shall investigate all 
reported spills. If such investigation shows that appropriate action is 
being taken by either the discharger or non-Federal entities, the 
Federal on-scene commander shall monitor and provide advice or 
assistance, as required. If appropriate containment or cleanup action is 
not being taken by the discharger or non-Federal entities, the Federal 
on-scene commander will take control of the response activity in 
accordance with section 11(c)(1) of the Federal Act.

regional oil removal contingency plans are:
    (a) Definition of the authorities, responsibilities and duties of 
all persons, organizations or agencies which are to be involved or could 
be involved in planning or directing oil removal operations, with 
particular care to clearly define the authorities, responsibilities and 
duties of State and local governmental agencies to avoid unnecessary 
duplication of contingency planning activities and to minimize the 
potential for conflict and confusion that could be generated in an 
emergency situation as a result of such duplications.
    (b) Establishment of notification procedures for the purpose of 
early detection and timely notification of an oil discharge including:
    (1) The identification of critical water use areas to facilitate the 
reporting of and response to oil discharges.
    (2) A current list of names, telephone numbers and addresses of the 
responsible persons and alternates on call to receive notification of an 
oil discharge as well as the names, telephone numbers and addresses of 
the organizations and agencies to be notified when an oil discharge is 
discovered.
    (3) Provisions for access to a reliable communications system for 
timely notification of an oil discharge and incorporation in the 
communications system of the capability for interconnection with the 
communications systems established under related oil removal contingency 
plans, particularly State and National plans.
    (4) An established, prearranged procedure for requesting assistance 
during a major disaster or when the situation exceeds the response 
capability of the State, local or regional authority.
    (c) Provisions to assure that full resource capability is known and 
can be committed during an oil discharge situation including:
    (1) The identification and inventory of applicable equipment, 
materials and supplies which are available locally and regionally.
    (2) An estimate of the equipment, materials and supplies which would 
be required to remove the maximum oil discharge to be anticipated.
    (3) Development of agreements and arrangements in advance of an oil 
discharge for the acquisition of equipment, materials and supplies to be 
used in responding to such a discharge.
    (d) Provisions for well defined and specific actions to be taken 
after discovery and notification of an oil discharge including:
    (1) Specification of an oil discharge response operating team 
consisting of

[[Page 288]]

trained, prepared and available operating personnel.
    (2) Predesignation of a properly qualified oil discharge response 
coordinator who is charged with the responsibility and delegated 
commensurate authority for directing and coordinating response 
operations and who knows how to request assistance from Federal 
authorities operating under existing national and regional contingency 
plans.
    (3) A preplanned location for an oil discharge response operations 
center and a reliable communications system for directing the 
coordinated overall response operations.
    (4) Provisions for varying degrees of response effort depending on 
the severity of the oil discharge.
    (5) Specification of the order of priority in which the various 
water uses are to be protected where more than one water use may be 
adversely affected as a result of an oil discharge and where response 
operations may not be adequate to protect all uses.
    (e) Specific and well defined procedures to facilitate recovery of 
damages and enforcement measures as provided for by State and local 
statutes and ordinances.


<R05>
Sec. 109.6   Coordination.

    For the purposes of coordination, the contingency plans of State and 
local governments should be developed and implemented in consultation 
with private interests. A copy of any oil removal contingency plan 
developed by State and local governments should be forwarded to the 
Council on Environmental Quality upon request to facilitate the 
coordination of these contingency plans with the National Oil and 
Hazardous Materials Pollution Contingency Plan.

Sec. 110.6  Notice.

    Any person in charge of a vessel or of an onshore or offshore 
facility shall, as soon as he or she has knowledge of any discharge of 
oil from such vessel or facility in violation of section 311(b)(3) of 
the Act, immediately notify the National Response Center (NRC) (800-424-
8802; in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, 202-426-2675). If direct 
reporting to the NRC is not practicable, reports may be made to the 
Coast Guard or EPA predesignated On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) for the 
geographic area where the discharge occurs. All such reports shall be 
promptly relayed to the NRC. If it is not possible to notify the NRC or 
the predesignated OCS immediately, reports may be made immediately to 
the nearest Coast Guard unit, provided that the person in charge of the 
vessel or onshore or offshore facility notifies the NRC as soon as 
possible. The reports shall be made in accordance with such procedures 
as the Secretary of Transportation may prescribe. The procedures for 
such notice are set forth in U.S. Coast Guard regulations, 33 CFR part

    (a) This part establishes procedures, methods and equipment and 
other requirements for equipment to prevent the discharge of oil from 
non-transportation-related onshore and offshore facilities into or upon 
the navigable waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, this part 
applies to owners or operators of non-transportation-related onshore and 
offshore facilities engaged in drilling, producing, gathering, storing, 
processing, refining, transferring, distributing or consuming oil and 
oil products, and which, due to their location, could reasonably be 
expected to discharge oil in harmful quantities, as defined in part 110 
of this chapter, into or upon the navigable waters of the United States 
or adjoining shorelines.
    (c) As provided in section 313 (86 Stat. 875) departments, agencies, 
and instrumentalities of the Federal government are subject to these 
regulations to the

[[Page 291]]

same extent as any person, except for the provisions of Sec. 112.6.
    (d) This part does not apply to:
    (1) Facilities, equipment or operations which are not subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection Agency, as follows:
    (i) Onshore and offshore facilities, which, due to their location, 
could not reasonably be expected to discharge oil into or upon the 
navigable waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines. This 
determination shall be based solely upon a consideration of the 
geographical, locational aspects of the facility (such as proximity to 
navigable waters or adjoining shorelines, land contour, drainage, etc.) 
and shall exclude consideration of manmade features such as dikes, 
equipment or other structures which may serve to restrain, hinder, 
contain, or otherwise prevent a discharge of oil from reaching navigable 
waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines; and
    (ii) Equipment or operations of vessels or transportation-related 
onshore and offshore facilities which are subject to authority and 
control of the Department of Transportation, as defined in the 
Memorandum of Understanding between the Secretary of Transportation and 
the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, dated November 
24, 1971, 36 FR 24000.
    (2) Those facilities which, although otherwise subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection Agency, meet both of the 
following requirements:
    (i) The underground buried storage capacity of the facility is 
42,000 gallons or less of oil, and
    (ii) The storage capacity, which is not buried, of the facility is 
1,320 gallons or less of oil, provided no single container has a 
capacity in excess of 660 gallons.
    (e) This part provides for the preparation and implementation of 
Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plans prepared in accordance 
with Sec. 112.7, designed to complement existing laws, regulations, 
rules, standards, policies and procedures pertaining to safety 
standards, fire prevention and pollution prevention rules, so as to form 
a comprehensive balanced Federal/State spill prevention program to 
minimize the potential for oil discharges. Compliance with this part 
does not in any way relieve the owner or operator of an onshore or an 
offshore facility from compliance with other Federal, State or local 
laws.

discharged or, due to their location, could reasonably be expected to 
discharge oil in harmful quantities, as defined in 40 CFR part 110, into 
or upon the navigable waters of the United States or adjoining 
shorelines, shall prepare a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure 
Plan (hereinafter ``SPCC Plan''), in writing and in accordance with 
Sec. 112.7. Except as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section, 
such SPCC Plan shall be prepared within six months after the effective 
date of this part and shall be fully implemented as soon as possible, 
but not later than one year after the effective date of this part.
    (b) Owners or operators of onshore and offshore facilities that 
become operational after the effective date of this part, and that have 
discharged or could reasonably be expected to discharge oil in harmful 
quantities, as defined in 40 CFR part 110, into or upon the navigable 
waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines, shall prepare an 
SPCC Plan in accordance with Sec. 112.7. Except as provided for in 
paragraph (f) of this section, such SPCC Plan shall be prepared within 
six months after the date such facility begins operations and shall be 
fully implemented as soon as possible, but not later than one year after 
such facility begins operations.
    (c) Owners or operators of onshore and offshore mobile or portable 
facilities, such as onshore drilling or workover rigs, barge mounted 
offshore drilling or workover rigs, and portable fueling facilities 
shall prepare and implement an SPCC Plan as required by paragraphs (a), 
(b) and (d) of this section. The owners or operators of such facility 
need not prepare a new SPCC Plan each time the facility is moved to a 
new site. The SPCC Plan may be a general plan, prepared in accordance 
with Sec. 112.7, using good engineering practice. When the mobile or 
portable facility is moved, it must be located and installed using the 
spill prevention practices outlined in the SPCC Plan for the facility. 
No mobile or portable facility subject to this regulation shall operate 
unless the SPCC Plan has been implemented. The SPCC Plan shall only 
apply while the facility is in a fixed (non-transportation) operating 
mode.
    (d) No SPCC Plan shall be effective to satisfy the requirements of 
this part unless it has been reviewed by a Registered Professional 
Engineer and certified to by such Professional Engineer. By means of 
this certification the engineer, having examined the facility and being 
familiar with the provisions of this part, shall attest that the SPCC 
Plan has been prepared in accordance with good engineering practices.

normally attended at least 8 hours per day, or at the nearest field 
office if the facility is not so attended, and shall make such Plan 
available to the Regional Administrator for on-site review during normal 
working hours.
    (f) Extensions of time. (1) The Regional Administrator may authorize 
an extension of time for the preparation and full implementation of an 
SPCC Plan beyond the time permitted for the preparation and 
implementation of an SPCC Plan pursuant to paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of 
this section where he finds that the owner or operator of a facility 
subject to paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of this section cannot fully 
comply with the requirements of this part as a result of either 
nonavailability of qualified personnel, or delays in construction or 
equipment delivery beyond the control and without the fault of such 
owner or operator or their respective agents or employees.
    (2) Any owner or operator seeking an extension of time pursuant to 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section may submit a letter of request to the 
Regional Administrator. Such letter shall include:
    (i) A complete copy of the SPCC Plan, if completed;
    (ii) A full explanation of the cause for any such delay and the 
specific aspects of the SPCC Plan affected by the delay;
    (iii) A full discussion of actions being taken or contemplated to 
minimize or mitigate such delay;
    (iv) A proposed time schedule for the implementation of any 
corrective actions being taken or contemplated, including interim dates 
for completion of tests or studies, installation and operation of any 
necessary equipment or other preventive measures.

In addition, such owner or operator may present additional oral or 
written statements in support of his letter of request.
    (3) The submission of a letter of request for extension of time 
pursuant to paragraph (f)(2) of this section shall in no way relieve the 
owner or operator from his obligation to comply with the requirements of 
Sec. 112.3 (a), (b) or (c). Where an extension of time is authorized by 
the Regional Administrator for particular equipment or other specific 
aspects of the SPCC Plan, such extension shall in no way affect the 
owner's or operator's obligation to comply with the requirements of 
Sec. 112.3 (a), (b) or (c) with respect to other equipment or other 
specific aspects of the SPCC Plan for which an extension of time has not 
been expressly authorized.

the facility owner or operator may submit written information, views, 
and arguments on the amendment. After considering all relevant material 
presented, the Regional Administrator shall notify the facility owner or 
operator of any amendment required or shall rescind the notice. The 
amendment required by the Regional Administrator shall become part of 
the Plan 30 days after such notice, unless the Regional Administrator, 
for good cause, shall specify another effective date. The owner or 
operator of the facility shall implement the amendment of the Plan as 
soon as possible, but not later than six months after the amendment 
becomes part of the Plan, unless the Regional Administrator specifies 
another date.
    (f) An owner or operator may appeal a decision made by the Regional 
Administrator requiring an amendment to an SPCC Plan. The appeal shall 
be made to the Administrator of the United States Environmental 
Protection Agency and must be made in writing within 30 days of receipt 
of the notice from the Regional Administrator requiring the amendment. A

Sec. 112.5   Amendment of Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plans by owners or operators.

    (a) Owners or operators of facilities subject to Sec. 112.3 (a), (b) 
or (c) shall amend the SPCC Plan for such facility in accordance with 
Sec. 112.7 whenever there is a change in facility design, construction, 
operation or maintenance which materially affects the facility's 
potential for the discharge of

[[Page 296]]

oil into or upon the navigable waters of the United States or adjoining 
shore lines. Such amendments shall be fully implemented as soon as 
possible, but not later than six months after such change occurs.
    (b) Notwithstanding compliance with paragraph (a) of this section, 
owners and operators of facilities subject to Sec. 112.3 (a), (b) or (c) 
shall complete a review and evaluation of the SPCC Plan at least once 
every three years from the date such facility becomes subject to this 
part. As a result of this review and evaluation, the owner or operator 
shall amend the SPCC Plan within six months of the review to include 
more effective prevention and control technology if: (1) Such technology 
will significantly reduce the likelihood of a spill event from the 
facility, and (2) if such technology has been field-proven at the time 
of the review.
    (c) No amendment to an SPCC Plan shall be effective to satisfy the 
requirements of this section unless it has been certified by a 
Professional Engineer in accordance with Sec. 112.3(d).


<R05>
Sec. 112.7   Guidelines for the preparation and implementation of a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan.

    The SPCC Plan shall be a carefully thought-out plan, prepared in 
accordance with good engineering practices, and which has the full 
approval of management at a level with authority to commit the necessary 
resources. If the plan calls for additional facilities or procedures, 
methods, or equipment not yet fully operational, these items should be 
discussed in separate paragraphs, and the details of installation and 
operational start-up should be explained separately. The complete SPCC 
Plan shall follow the sequence outlined below, and include a discussion 
of the facility's conformance with the appropriate guidelines listed:
    (a) A facility which has experienced one or more spill events within 
twelve months prior to the effective date of this part should include a 
written description of each such spill, corrective action taken and 
plans for preventing recurrence.
    (b) Where experience indicates a reasonable potential for equipment 
failure (such as tank overflow, rupture, or leakage), the plan should 
include a prediction of the direction, rate of flow, and total quantity 
of oil which could be discharged from the facility as a result of each 
major type of failure.
    (c) Appropriate containment and/or diversionary structures or 
equipment to prevent discharged oil from reaching a navigable water 
course should be provided. One of the following preventive systems or 
its equivalent should be used as a minimum:
    (1) Onshore facilities:
    (i) Dikes, berms or retaining walls sufficiently impervious to 
contain spilled oil;
    (ii) Curbing;
    (iii) Culverting, gutters or other drainage systems;
    (iv) Weirs, booms or other barriers;
    (v) Spill diversion ponds;
    (vi) Retention ponds;
    (vii) Sorbent materials.
    (2) Offshore facilities:
    (i) Curbing, drip pans;
    (ii) Sumps and collection systems.
    (d) When it is determined that the installation of structures or 
equipment listed in Sec. 112.7(c) to prevent discharged oil from 
reaching the navigable waters is not practicable from any onshore or 
offshore facility, the owner or operator should clearly demonstrate such 
impracticability and provide the following:
    (1) A strong oil spill contingency plan following the provision of 
40 CFR part 109.
    (2) A written commitment of manpower, equipment and materials 
required to expeditiously control and remove any harmful quantity of oil 
discharged.
    (e) In addition to the minimal prevention standards listed under 
Sec. 112.7(c), sections of the Plan should include a complete discussion 
of conformance with the following applicable guidelines, other effective 
spill prevention and containment procedures (or, if more stringent, with 
State rules, regulations and guidelines):
    (1) Facility drainage (onshore); (excluding production facilities). 
(i) Drainage from diked storage areas should be restrained by valves or 
other positive means to prevent a spill or other excessive leakage of 
oil into the drainage

[[Page 297]]

system or inplant effluent treatment system, except where plan systems 
are designed to handle such leakage. Diked areas may be emptied by pumps 
or ejectors; however, these should be manually activated and the 
condition of the accumulation should be examined before starting to be 
sure no oil will be discharged into the water.
    (ii) Flapper-type drain valves should not be used to drain diked 
areas. Valves used for the drainage of diked areas should, as far as 
practical, be of manual, open-and-closed design. When plant drainage 
drains directly into water courses and not into wastewater treatment 
plants, retained storm water should be inspected as provided in 
paragraphs (e)(2)(iii) (B), (C) and (D) of this section before drainage.
    (iii) Plant drainage systems from undiked areas should, if possible, 
flow into ponds, lagoons or catchment basins, designed to retain oil or 
return it to the facility. Catchment basins should not be located in 
areas subject to periodic flooding.
    (iv) If plant drainage is not engineered as above, the final 
discharge of all in-plant ditches should be equipped with a diversion 
system that could, in the event of an uncontrolled spill, return the oil 
to the plant.
    (v) Where drainage waters are treated in more than one treatment 
unit, natural hydraulic flow should be used. If pump transfer is needed, 
two ``lift'' pumps should be provided, and at least one of the pumps 
should be permanently installed when such treatment is continuous. In 
any event, whatever techniques are used facility drainage systems should 
be adequately engineered to prevent oil from reaching navigable waters 
in the event of equipment failure or human error at the facility.
    (2) Bulk storage tanks (onshore); (excluding production facilities). 
(i) No tank should be used for the storage of oil unless its material 
and construction are compatible with the material stored and conditions 
of storage such as pressure and temperature, etc.
    (ii) All bulk storage tank installations should be constructed so 
that a secondary means of containment is provided for the entire 
contents of the largest single tank plus sufficient freeboard to allow 
for precipitation. Diked areas should be sufficiently impervious to 
contain spilled oil. Dikes, containment curbs, and pits are commonly 
employed for this purpose, but they may not always be appropriate. An 
alternative system could consist of a complete drainage trench enclosure 
arranged so that a spill could terminate and be safely confined in an 
in-plant catchment basin or holding pond.
    (iii) Drainage of rainwater from the diked area into a storm drain 
or an effluent discharge that empties into an open water course, lake, 
or pond, and bypassing the in-plant treatment system may be acceptable 
if:
    (A) The bypass valve is normally sealed closed.
    (B) Inspection of the run-off rain water ensures compliance with 
applicable water quality standards and will not cause a harmful 
discharge as defined in 40 CFR part 110.
    (C) The bypass valve is opened, and resealed following drainage 
under responsible supervision.
    (D) Adequate records are kept of such events.
    (iv) Buried metallic storage tanks represent a potential for 
undetected spills. A new buried installation should be protected from 
corrosion by coatings, cathodic protection or other effective methods 
compatible with local soil conditions. Such buried tanks should at least 
be subjected to regular pressure testing.
    (v) Partially buried metallic tanks for the storage of oil should be 
avoided, unless the buried section of the shell is adequately coated, 
since partial burial in damp earth can cause rapid corrosion of metallic 
surfaces, especially at the earth/air interface.
    (vi) Aboveground tanks should be subject to periodic integrity 
testing, taking into account tank design (floating roof, etc.) and using 
such techniques as hydrostatic testing, visual inspection or a system of 
non-destructive shell thickness testing. Comparison records should be 
kept where appropriate, and tank supports and foundations should be 
included in these inspections. In addition, the outside of the tank 
should frequently be observed by operating personnel for signs of 
deterioration, leaks which might cause a

[[Page 298]]

spill, or accumulation of oil inside diked areas.
    (vii) To control leakage through defective internal heating coils, 
the following factors should be considered and applied, as appropriate.
    (A) The steam return or exhaust lines from internal heating coils 
which discharge into an open water course should be monitored for 
contamination, or passed through a settling tank, skimmer, or other 
separation or retention system.
    (B) The feasibility of installing an external heating system should 
also be considered.
    (viii) New and old tank installations should, as far as practical, 
be fail-safe engineered or updated into a fail-safe engineered 
installation to avoid spills. Consideration should be given to providing 
one or more of the following devices:
    (A) High liquid level alarms with an audible or visual signal at a 
constantly manned operation or surveillance station; in smaller plants 
an audible air vent may suffice.
    (B) Considering size and complexity of the facility, high liquid 
level pump cutoff devices set to stop flow at a predetermined tank 
content level.
    (C) Direct audible or code signal communication between the tank 
gauger and the pumping station.
    (D) A fast response system for determining the liquid level of each 
bulk storage tank such as digital computers, telepulse, or direct vision 
gauges or their equivalent.
    (E) Liquid level sensing devices should be regularly tested to 
insure proper operation.
    (ix) Plant effluents which are discharged into navigable waters 
should have disposal facilities observed frequently enough to detect 
possible system upsets that could cause an oil spill event.
    (x) Visible oil leaks which result in a loss of oil from tank seams, 
gaskets, rivets and bolts sufficiently large to cause the accumulation 
of oil in diked areas should be promptly corrected.
    (xi) Mobile or portable oil storage tanks (onshore) should be 
positioned or located so as to prevent spilled oil from reaching 
navigable waters. A secondary means of containment, such as dikes or 
catchment basins, should be furnished for the largest single compartment 
or tank. These facilities should be located where they will not be 
subject to periodic flooding or washout.
    (3) Facility transfer operations, pumping, and in-plant process 
(onshore); (excluding production facilities). (i) Buried piping 
installations should have a protective wrapping and coating and should 
be cathodically protected if soil conditions warrant. If a section of 
buried line is exposed for any reason, it should be carefully examined 
for deterioration. If corrosion damage is found, additional examination 
and corrective action should be taken as indicated by the magnitude of 
the damage. An alternative would be the more frequent use of exposed 
pipe corridors or galleries.
    (ii) When a pipeline is not in service, or in standby service for an 
extended time the terminal connection at the transfer point should be 
capped or blank-flanged, and marked as to origin.
    (iii) Pipe supports should be properly designed to minimize abrasion 
and corrosion and allow for expansion and contraction.
    (iv) All aboveground valves and pipelines should be subjected to 
regular examinations by operating personnel at which time the general 
condition of items, such as flange joints, expansion joints, valve 
glands and bodies, catch pans, pipeline supports, locking of valves, and 
metal surfaces should be assessed. In addition, periodic pressure 
testing may be warranted for piping in areas where facility drainage is 
such that a failure might lead to a spill event.
    (v) Vehicular traffic granted entry into the facility should be 
warned verbally or by appropriate signs to be sure that the vehicle, 
because of its size, will not endanger above ground piping.
    (4) Facility tank car and tank truck loading/unloading rack 
(onshore). (i) Tank car and tank truck loading/unloading procedures 
should meet the minimum requirements and regulation established by the 
Department of Transportation.
    (ii) Where rack area drainage does not flow into a catchment basin 
or treatment facility designed to handle spills, a quick drainage system 
should

[[Page 299]]

be used for tank truck loading and unloading areas. The containment 
system should be designed to hold at least maximum capacity of any 
single compartment of a tank car or tank truck loaded or unloaded in the 
plant.
    (iii) An interlocked warning light or physical barrier system, or 
warning signs, should be provided in loading/unloading areas to prevent 
vehicular departure before complete disconnect of flexible or fixed 
transfer lines.
    (iv) Prior to filling and departure of any tank car or tank truck, 
the lowermost drain and all outlets of such vehicles should be closely 
examined for leakage, and if necessary, tightened, adjusted, or replaced 
to prevent liquid leakage while in transit.
    (5) Oil production facilities (onshore)--(i) Definition. An onshore 
production facility may include all wells, flowlines, separation 
equipment, storage facilities, gathering lines, and auxiliary non-
transportation-related equipment and facilities in a single geographical 
oil or gas field operated by a single operator.
    (ii) Oil production facility (onshore) drainage. (A) At tank 
batteries and central treating stations where an accidental discharge of 
oil would have a reasonable possibility of reaching navigable waters, 
the dikes or equivalent required under Sec. 112.7(c)(1) should have 
drains closed and sealed at all times except when rainwater is being 
drained. Prior to drainage, the diked area should be inspected as 
provided in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii) (B), (C), and (D) of this section. 
Accumulated oil on the rainwater should be picked up and returned to 
storage or disposed of in accordance with approved methods.
    (B) Field drainage ditches, road ditches, and oil traps, sumps or 
skimmers, if such exist, should be inspected at regularly scheduled 
intervals for accumulation of oil that may have escaped from small 
leaks. Any such accumulations should be removed.
    (iii) Oil production facility (onshore) bulk storage tanks. (A) No 
tank should be used for the storage of oil unless its material and 
construction are compatible with the material stored and the conditions 
of storage.
    (B) All tank battery and central treating plant installations should 
be provided with a secondary means of containment for the entire 
contents of the largest single tank if feasible, or alternate systems 
such as those outlined in Sec. 112.7(c)(1). Drainage from undiked areas 
should be safely confined in a catchment basin or holding pond.
    (C) All tanks containing oil should be visually examined by a 
competent person for condition and need for maintenance on a scheduled 
periodic basis. Such examination should include the foundation and 
supports of tanks that are above the surface of the ground.
    (D) New and old tank battery installations should, as far as 
practical, be fail-safe engineered or updated into a fail-safe 
engineered installation to prevent spills. Consideration should be given 
to one or more of the following:
    (1) Adequate tank capacity to assure that a tank will not overfill 
should a pumper/gauger be delayed in making his regular rounds.
    (2) Overflow equalizing lines between tanks so that a full tank can 
overflow to an adjacent tank.
    (3) Adequate vacuum protection to prevent tank collapse during a 
pipeline run.
    (4) High level sensors to generate and transmit an alarm signal to 
the computer where facilities are a part of a computer production 
control system.
    (iv) Facility transfer operations, oil production facility 
(onshore). (A) All above ground valves and pipelines should be examined 
periodically on a scheduled basis for general condition of items such as 
flange joints, valve glands and bodies, drip pans, pipeline supports, 
pumping well polish rod stuffing boxes, bleeder and gauge valves.
    (B) Salt water (oil field brine) disposal facilities should be 
examined often, particularly following a sudden change in atmospheric 
temperature to detect possible system upsets that could cause an oil 
discharge.
    (C) Production facilities should have a program of flowline 
maintenance to prevent spills from this source. The program should 
include periodic examinations, corrosion protection, flowline 
replacement, and adequate records, as appropriate, for the individual 
facility.
    (6) Oil drilling and workover facilities (onshore). (i) Mobile 
drilling or

[[Page 300]]

workover equipment should be positioned or located so as to prevent 
spilled oil from reaching navigable waters.
    (ii) Depending on the location, catchment basins or diversion 
structures may be necessary to intercept and contain spills of fuel, 
crude oil, or oily drilling fluids.
    (iii) Before drilling below any casing string or during workover 
operations, a blowout prevention (BOP) assembly and well control system 
should be installed that is capable of controlling any well head 
pressure that is expected to be encountered while that BOP assembly is 
on the well. Casing and BOP installations should be in accordance with 
State regulatory agency requirements.
    (7) Oil drilling, production, or workover facilities (offshore). (i) 
Definition: ``An oil drilling, production or workover facility 
(offshore)'' may include all drilling or workover equipment, wells, 
flowlines, gathering lines, platforms, and auxiliary nontransportation-
related equipment and facilities in a single geographical oil or gas 
field operated by a single operator.
    (ii) Oil drainage collection equipment should be used to prevent and 
control small oil spillage around pumps, glands, valves, flanges, 
expansion joints, hoses, drain lines, separators, treaters, tanks, and 
allied equipment. Drains on the facility should be controlled and 
directed toward a central collection sump or equivalent collection 
system sufficient to prevent discharges of oil into the navigable waters 
of the United States. Where drains and sumps are not practicable oil 
contained in collection equipment should be removed as often as 
necessary to prevent overflow.
    (iii) For facilities employing a sump system, sump and drains should 
be adequately sized and a spare pump or equivalent method should be 
available to remove liquid from the sump and assure that oil does not 
escape. A regular scheduled preventive maintenance inspection and 
testing program should be employed to assure reliable operation of the 
liquid removal system and pump start-up device. Redundant automatic sump 
pumps and control devices may be required on some installations.
    (iv) In areas where separators and treaters are equipped with dump 
valves whose predominant mode of failure is in the closed position and 
pollution risk is high, the facility should be specially equipped to 
prevent the escape of oil. This could be accomplished by extending the 
flare line to a diked area if the separator is near shore, equipping it 
with a high liquid level sensor that will automatically shut-in wells 
producing to the separator, parallel redundant dump valves, or other 
feasible alternatives to prevent oil discharges.
    (v) Atmospheric storage or surge tanks should be equipped with high 
liquid level sensing devices or other acceptable alternatives to prevent 
oil discharges.
    (vi) Pressure tanks should be equipped with high and low pressure 
sensing devices to activate an alarm and/or control the flow or other 
acceptable alternatives to prevent oil discharges.
    (vii) Tanks should be equipped with suitable corrosion protection.
    (viii) A written procedure for inspecting and testing pollution 
prevention equipment and systems should be prepared and maintained at 
the facility. Such procedures should be included as part of the SPCC 
Plan.
    (ix) Testing and inspection of the pollution prevention equipment 
and systems at the facility should be conducted by the owner or operator 
on a scheduled periodic basis commensurate with the complexity, 
conditions and circumstances of the facility or other appropriate 
regulations.
    (x) Surface and subsurface well shut-in valves and devices in use at 
the facility should be sufficiently described to determine method of 
activation or control, e.g., pressure differential, change in fluid or 
flow conditions, combination of pressure and flow, manual or remote 
control mechanisms. Detailed records for each well, while not 
necessarily part of the plan should be kept by the owner or operator.
    (xi) Before drilling below any casing string, and during workover 
operations a blowout preventer (BOP) assembly and well control system 
should be installed that is capable of controlling any well-head 
pressure that is expected

[[Page 301]]

to be encountered while that BOP assembly is on the well. Casing and BOP 
installations should be in accordance with State regulatory agency 
requirements.
    (xii) Extraordinary well control measures should be provided should 
emergency conditions, including fire, loss of control and other abnormal 
conditions, occur. The degree of control system redundancy should vary 
with hazard exposure and probable consequences of failure. It is 
recommended that surface shut-in systems have redundant or ``fail 
close'' valving. Subsurface safety valves may not be needed in producing 
wells that will not flow but should be installed as required by 
applicable State regulations.
    (xiii) In order that there will be no misunderstanding of joint and 
separate duties and obligations to perform work in a safe and pollution 
free manner, written instructions should be prepared by the owner or 
operator for contractors and subcontractors to follow whenever contract 
activities include servicing a well or systems appurtenant to a well or 
pressure vessel. Such instructions and procedures should be maintained 
at the offshore production facility. Under certain circumstances and 
conditions such contractor activities may require the presence at the 
facility of an authorized representative of the owner or operator who 
would intervene when necessary to prevent a spill event.
    (xiv) All manifolds (headers) should be equipped with check valves 
on individual flowlines.
    (xv) If the shut-in well pressure is greater than the working 
pressure of the flowline and manifold valves up to and including the 
header valves associated with that individual flowline, the flowline 
should be equipped with a high pressure sensing device and shut-in valve 
at the wellhead unless provided with a pressure relief system to prevent 
over pressuring.
    (xvi) All pipelines appurtenant to the facility should be protected 
from corrosion. Methods used, such as protective coatings or cathodic 
protection, should be discussed.
    (xvii) Sub-marine pipelines appurtenant to the facility should be 
adequately protected against environmental stresses and other activities 
such as fishing operations.
    (xviii) Sub-marine pipelines appurtenant to the facility should be 
in good operating condition at all times and inspected on a scheduled 
periodic basis for failures. Such inspections should be documented and 
maintained at the facility.
    (8) Inspections and records. Inspections required by this part 
should be in accordance with written procedures developed for the 
facility by the owner or operator. These written procedures and a record 
of the inspections, signed by the appropriate supervisor or inspector, 
should be made part of the SPCC Plan and maintained for a period of 
three years.
    (9) Security (excluding oil production facilities). (i) All plants 
handling, processing, and storing oil should be fully fenced, and 
entrance gates should be locked and/or guarded when the plant is not in 
production or is unattended.
    (ii) The master flow and drain valves and any other valves that will 
permit direct outward flow of the tank's content to the surface should 
be securely locked in the closed position when in non-operating or non-
standby status.
    (iii) The starter control on all oil pumps should be locked in the 
``off'' position or located at a site accessible only to authorized 
personnel when the pumps are in a non-operating or non-standby status.
    (iv) The loading/unloading connections of oil pipelines should be 
securely capped or blank-flanged when not in service or standby service 
for an extended time. This security practice should also apply to 
pipelines that are emptied of liquid content either by draining or by 
inert gas pressure.
    (v) Facility lighting should be commensurate with the type and 
location of the facility. Consideration should be given to: (A) 
Discovery of spills occurring during hours of darkness, both by 
operating personnel, if present, and by non-operating personnel (the 
general public, local police, etc.) and (B) prevention of spills 
occurring through acts of vandalism.

[[Page 302]]

    (10) Personnel, training and spill prevention procedures. (i) Owners 
or operators are responsible for properly instructing their personnel in 
the operation and maintenance of equipment to prevent the discharges of 
oil and applicable pollution control laws, rules and regulations.
    (ii) Each applicable facility should have a designated person who is 
accountable for oil spill prevention and who reports to line management.
    (iii) Owners or operators should schedule and conduct spill 
prevention briefings for their operating personnel at intervals frequent 
enough to assure adequate understanding of the SPCC Plan for that 
facility. Such briefings should highlight and describe known spill 
events or failures, malfunctioning components, and recently developed 
precautionary measures.


<R05>
Sec. 112.20  Facility response plans.

    (a) The owner or operator of any non-transportation-related onshore 
facility that, because of its location, could reasonably be expected to 
cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging oil into or on 
the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines shall prepare and submit a 
facility response plan to the Regional Administrator, according to the 
following provisions:
    (1) For the owner or operator of a facility in operation on or 
before February 18, 1993 who is required to prepare and submit a 
response plan under 33 U.S.C. 1321(j)(5), the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 
(Pub. L. 101-380, 33 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) requires the submission of a 
response plan that satisfies the requirements of 33 U.S.C. 1321(j)(5) no 
later than February 18, 1993.
    (i) The owner or operator of an existing facility that was in 
operation on or before February 18, 1993 who submitted a response plan 
by February 18, 1993 shall revise the response plan to satisfy the 
requirements of this section and resubmit the response plan or updated 
portions of the response plan to the Regional Administrator by February 
18, 1995.
    (ii) The owner or operator of an existing facility in operation on 
or before February 18, 1993 who failed to submit a response plan by 
February 18, 1993 shall prepare and submit a response plan that 
satisfies the requirements of this section to the Regional Administrator 
before August 30, 1994.
    (2) The owner or operator of a facility in operation on or after 
August 30, 1994 that satisfies the criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this 
section or that is notified by the Regional Administrator pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section shall prepare and submit a facility 
response plan that satisfies the requirements of this section to the 
Regional Administrator.
    (i) For a facility that commenced operations after February 18, 1993 
but prior to August 30, 1994, and is required to prepare and submit a 
response plan based on the criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, 
the owner or operator shall submit the response plan or updated portions 
of the response plan, along with a completed version of the response 
plan cover sheet contained in Appendix F to this part, to the Regional 
Administrator prior to August 30, 1994.
    (ii) For a newly constructed facility that commences operation after 
August 30, 1994, and is required to prepare and submit a response plan 
based on the criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the owner or 
operator shall submit the response plan, along with a completed version 
of the response plan cover sheet contained in Appendix F to this part, 
to the Regional Administrator prior to the start of operations 
(adjustments to the response plan to reflect changes that occur at the 
facility during the start-up phase of operations must be submitted to 
the Regional Administrator after an operational trial period of 60 
days).
    (iii) For a facility required to prepare and submit a response plan 
after August 30, 1994, as a result of a planned change in design, 
construction, operation, or maintenance that renders the facility 
subject to the criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the owner 
or operator shall submit the response plan, along with a completed 
version of the response plan cover sheet contained in Appendix F to this 
part, to the Regional Administrator before the portion of the facility 
undergoing change commences operations (adjustments to the response plan 
to reflect

[[Page 303]]

changes that occur at the facility during the start-up phase of 
operations must be submitted to the Regional Administrator after an 
operational trial period of 60 days).
    (iv) For a facility required to prepare and submit a response plan 
after August 30, 1994, as a result of an unplanned event or change in 
facility characteristics that renders the facility subject to the 
criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the owner or operator 
shall submit the response plan, along with a completed version of the 
response plan cover sheet contained in Appendix F to this part, to the 
Regional Administrator within six months of the unplanned event or 
change.
    (3) In the event the owner or operator of a facility that is 
required to prepare and submit a response plan uses an alternative 
formula that is comparable to one contained in Appendix C to this part 
to evaluate the criterion in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) or (f)(1)(ii)(C) of 
this section, the owner or operator shall attach documentation to the 
response plan cover sheet contained in Appendix F to this part that 
demonstrates the reliability and analytical soundness of the alternative 
formula.
    (b)(1) The Regional Administrator may at any time require the owner 
or operator of any non-transportation-related onshore facility to 
prepare and submit a facility response plan under this section after 
considering the factors in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. If such a 
determination is made, the Regional Administrator shall notify the 
facility owner or operator in writing and shall provide a basis for the 
determination. If the Regional Administrator notifies the owner or 
operator in writing of the requirement to prepare and submit a response 
plan under this section, the owner or operator of the facility shall 
submit the response plan to the Regional Administrator within six months 
of receipt of such written notification.
    (2) The Regional Administrator shall review plans submitted by such 
facilities to determine whether the facility could, because of its 
location, reasonably be expected to cause significant and substantial 
harm to the environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable 
waters or adjoining shorelines.
    (c) The Regional Administrator shall determine whether a facility 
could, because of its location, reasonably be expected to cause 
significant and substantial harm to the environment by discharging oil 
into or on the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines, based on the 
factors in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. If such a determination is 
made, the Regional Administrator shall notify the owner or operator of 
the facility in writing and:
    (1) Promptly review the facility response plan;
    (2) Require amendments to any response plan that does not meet the 
requirements of this section;
    (3) Approve any response plan that meets the requirements of this 
section; and
    (4) Review each response plan periodically thereafter on a schedule 
established by the Regional Administrator provided that the period 
between plan reviews does not exceed five years.
    (d)(1) The owner or operator of a facility for which a response plan 
is required under this part shall revise and resubmit revised portions 
of the response plan within 60 days of each facility change that 
materially may affect the response to a worst case discharge, including:
    (i) A change in the facility's configuration that materially alters 
the information included in the response plan;
    (ii) A change in the type of oil handled, stored, or transferred 
that materially alters the required response resources;
    (iii) A material change in capabilities of the oil spill removal 
organization(s) that provide equipment and personnel to respond to 
discharges of oil described in paragraph (h)(5) of this section;
    (iv) A material change in the facility's spill prevention and 
response equipment or emergency response procedures; and
    (v) Any other changes that materially affect the implementation of 
the response plan.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 
amendments to personnel and telephone number lists included in the 
response plan and a

[[Page 304]]

change in the oil spill removal organization(s) that does not result in 
a material change in support capabilities do not require approval by the 
Regional Administrator. Facility owners or operators shall provide a 
copy of such changes to the Regional Administrator as the revisions 
occur.
    (3) The owner or operator of a facility that submits changes to a 
response plan as provided in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section 
shall provide the EPA-issued facility identification number (where one 
has been assigned) with the changes.
    (4) The Regional Administrator shall review for approval changes to 
a response plan submitted pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
for a facility determined pursuant to paragraph (f)(3) of this section 
to have the potential to cause significant and substantial harm to the 
environment.
    (e) If the owner or operator of a facility determines pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section that the facility could not, because of 
its location, reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the 
environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters or 
adjoining shorelines, the owner or operator shall complete and maintain 
at the facility the certification form contained in Appendix C to this 
part and, in the event an alternative formula that is comparable to one 
contained in Appendix C to this part is used to evaluate the criterion 
in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) or (f)(1)(ii)(C) of this section, the owner 
or operator shall attach documentation to the certification form that 
demonstrates the reliability and analytical soundness of the comparable 
formula and shall notify the Regional Administrator in writing that an 
alternative formula was used.
    (f)(1) A facility could, because of its location, reasonably be 
expected to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging oil 
into or on the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if it meets any of the following 
criteria applied in accordance with the flowchart contained in 
Attachment C-I to Appendix C to this part:
    (i) The facility transfers oil over water to or from vessels and has 
a total oil storage capacity greater than or equal to 42,000 gallons; or
    (ii) The facility's total oil storage capacity is greater than or 
equal to 1 million gallons, and one of the following is true:
    (A) The facility does not have secondary containment for each 
aboveground storage area sufficiently large to contain the capacity of 
the largest aboveground oil storage tank within each storage area plus 
sufficient freeboard to allow for precipitation;
    (B) The facility is located at a distance (as calculated using the 
appropriate formula in Appendix C to this part or a comparable formula) 
such that a discharge from the facility could cause injury to fish and 
wildlife and sensitive environments. For further description of fish and 
wildlife and sensitive environments, see Appendices I, II, and III of 
the ``Guidance for Facility and Vessel Response Plans: Fish and Wildlife 
and Sensitive Environments'' (see Appendix E to this part, section 10, 
for availability) and the applicable Area Contingency Plan prepared 
pursuant to section 311(j)(4) of the Clean Water Act;
    (C) The facility is located at a distance (as calculated using the 
appropriate formula in Appendix C to this part or a comparable formula) 
such that a discharge from the facility would shut down a public 
drinking water intake; or
    (D) The facility has had a reportable oil spill in an amount greater 
than or equal to 10,000 gallons within the last 5 years.

agree with the Regional Administrator's determination that the facility 
could, because of its location, reasonably be expected to cause 
substantial harm or significant and substantial harm to the environment 
by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters or adjoining 
shorelines, or that amendments to the facility response plan are 
necessary prior to

[[Page 308]]

approval, such as changes to the worst case discharge planning volume, 
the owner or operator may submit a request for reconsideration to the 
Regional Administrator and provide additional information and data in 
writing to support the request. The request and accompanying information 
must be submitted to the Regional Administrator within 60 days of 
receipt of notice of the Regional Administrator's original decision. The 
Regional Administrator shall consider the request and render a decision 
as rapidly as practicable.
    (2) In the event the owner or operator of a facility believes a 
change in the facility's classification status is warranted because of 
an unplanned event or change in the facility's characteristics (i.e., 
substantial harm or significant and substantial harm), the owner or 
operator may submit a request for reconsideration to the Regional 
Administrator and provide additional information and data in writing to 
support the request. The Regional Administrator shall consider the 
request and render a decision as rapidly as practicable.
    (3) After a request for reconsideration under paragraph (i)(1) or 
(i)(2) of this section has been denied by the Regional Administrator, an 
owner or operator may appeal a determination made by the Regional 
Administrator. The appeal shall be made to the EPA Administrator and 
shall be made in writing within 60 days of receipt of the decision from 
the Regional Administrator that the request for reconsideration was 
denied. A complete copy of the appeal must be sent to the Regional 
Administrator at the time the appeal is made. The appeal shall contain a 
clear and concise statement of the issues and points of fact in the 
case. It also may contain additional information from the owner or 
operator, or from any other person. The EPA Administrator may request 
additional information from the owner or operator, or from any other 
person. The EPA Administrator shall render a decision as rapidly as 
practicable and shall notify the owner or operator of the decision.

                     Environmental Protection Agency

                                 Purpose

    This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) establishes the 
jurisdictional responsibilities for offshore facilities, including 
pipelines, pursuant to section 311 (j)(1)(c), (j)(5), and (j)(6)(A) of 
the Clean Water Act (CWA), as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 
(Public Law 101-380). The Secretary of the Department of the Interior 
(DOI), Secretary of the Department of Transportation (DOT), and 
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) agree to the 
division of responsibilities set forth below for spill prevention and 
control, response planning, and equipment inspection activities pursuant 
to those provisions.

                               Background

    Executive Order (E.O.) 12777 (56 FR 54757) delegates to DOI, DOT, 
and EPA various responsibilities identified in section 311(j) of the 
CWA. Sections 2(b)(3), 2(d)(3), and 2(e)(3) of E.O. 12777 assigned to 
DOI spill prevention and control, contingency planning, and equipment 
inspection activities associated with offshore facilities. Section 
311(a)(11) defines the term ``offshore facility'' to include facilities 
of any kind located in, on, or under navigable waters of the United 
States. By using this definition, the traditional DOI role of regulating 
facilities on the Outer Continental Shelf is expanded by E.O. 12777 to 
include inland lakes, rivers, streams, and any other inland waters.

                            Responsibilities

    Pursuant to section 2(i) of E.O. 12777, DOI redelegates, and EPA and 
DOT agree to assume, the functions vested in DOI by sections 2(b)(3), 
2(d)(3), and 2(e)(3) of E.O. 12777 as set forth below. For purposes of 
this MOU, the term ``coast line'' shall be defined as in the Submerged 
Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301(c)) to mean ``the line of ordinary low water 
along that portion of the coast which is in direct contact with the open 
sea and the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters.''
    1. To EPA, DOI redelegates responsibility for non-transportation-
related offshore facilities located landward of the coast line.
    2. To DOT, DOI redelegates responsibility for transportation-related 
facilities, including pipelines, located landward of the coast line. The 
DOT retains jurisdiction for deepwater ports and their associated 
seaward pipelines, as delegated by E.O. 12777.
    3. The DOI retains jurisdiction over facilities, including 
pipelines, located seaward of the coast line, except for deepwater ports 
and associated seaward pipelines delegated by E.O. 12777 to DOT.

                             Effective Date

    This MOU is effective on the date of the final execution by the 
indicated signatories.

                               Limitations

    1. The DOI, DOT, and EPA may agree in writing to exceptions to this 
MOU on a facility-specific basis. Affected parties will receive 
notification of the exceptions.
    2. Nothing in this MOU is intended to replace, supersede, or modify 
any existing agreements between or among DOI, DOT, or EPA.

                      Modification and Termination

    Any party to this agreement may propose modifications by submitting 
them in writing to the heads of the other agency/department. No 
modification may be adopted except with the consent of all parties. All 
parties shall indicate their consent to or disagreement with any 
proposed modification within 60 days of receipt. Upon the request of any 
party, representatives of all parties shall meet for the purpose of 
considering exceptions or modifications to this agreement. This MOU may 
be terminated only with the mutual consent of all parties.

    2.0  Description of Screening Criteria for the Substantial Harm 
                                Flowchart

    A facility that has the potential to cause substantial harm to the 
environment in the event of a discharge must prepare and submit a 
facility-specific response plan to EPA in accordance with Appendix F to 
this part. A description of the screening criteria for the substantial 
harm flowchart is provided below:
    2.1  Non-Transportation-Related Facilities With a Total Oil Storage 
Capacity Greater Than or Equal to 42,000 Gallons Where Operations 
Include Over-Water Transfers of Oil. A non-transportation-related 
facility with a total oil storage capacity greater than 42,000 gallons 
that transfers oil over water to or from vessels must submit a response 
plan to EPA. Daily oil transfer operations at these types of facilities 
occur between barges and vessels and onshore bulk storage tanks over 
open water. These facilities are located adjacent to navigable water.
    2.2  Lack of Adequate Secondary Containment at Facilities With a 
Total Oil Storage Capacity Greater Than or Equal to 1 Million Gallons. 
Any facility with a total oil storage capacity greater than or equal to 
1 million gallons without secondary containment sufficiently large to 
contain the capacity of the largest aboveground oil storage tank within 
each area plus sufficient freeboard to allow for precipitation must 
submit a response plan to EPA. Secondary containment structures that 
meet the standard of good engineering practice for the purposes of this 
part include berms, dikes, retaining walls, curbing, culverts, gutters, 
or other drainage systems.
    2.3  Proximity to Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments at 
Facilities With a Total Oil Storage Capacity Greater Than or Equal to 1 
Million Gallons. A facility with a total oil storage capacity greater 
than or equal to 1 million gallons must submit its response plan if it 
is located at a distance such that a discharge from the facility could 
cause injury (as defined at 40 CFR 112.2) to fish and wildlife and 
sensitive environments. For further description of fish and wildlife and 
sensitive environments, see Appendices I, II, and III to DOC/NOAA's 
``Guidance for Facility and Vessel Response Plans: Fish and Wildlife and 
Sensitive Environments'' (see Appendix E to this part, section 10, for 
availability) and the applicable Area Contingency Plan. Facility owners 
or operators must determine the distance at which an oil spill could 
cause injury to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments using the 
appropriate formula presented in Attachment C-III to this appendix or a 
comparable formula.
    2.4  Proximity to Public Drinking Water Intakes at Facilities with a 
Total Storage Oil Capacity Greater Than or Equal to 1 Million Gallons. A 
facility with a total storage capacity greater than or equal to 1 
million gallons must submit its response plan if it is located at a 
distance such that a discharge from the facility would shut down a 
public drinking water intake, which is analogous to a public water 
system as described at 40 CFR 143.2(c). The distance at which an oil 
spill from an SPCC-regulated facility would shut down a public drinking 
water intake shall be calculated using the appropriate formula presented 
in Attachment C-III to this appendix or a comparable formula.
    2.5  Facilities That Have Experienced Reportable Oil Spills in an 
Amount Greater Than or Equal to 10,000 Gallons Within the Past 5 Years

[[Page 312]]

and That Have a Total Oil Storage Capacity Greater Than or Equal to 1 
Million Gallons. A facility's oil spill history within the past 5 years 
shall be considered in the evaluation for substantial harm. Any facility 
with a total oil storage capacity greater than or equal to 1 million 
gallons that has experienced a reportable oil spill in an amount greater 
than or equal to 10,000 gallons within the past 5 years must submit a 
response plan to EPA.

   3.0  Certification for Facilities That Do Not Pose Substantial Harm

    If the facility does not meet the substantial harm criteria listed 
in Attachment C-I to this appendix, the owner or operator shall complete 
and maintain at the facility the certification form contained in 
Attachment C-II to this appendix. In the event an alternative formula 
that is comparable to the one in this appendix is used to evaluate the 
substantial harm criteria, the owner or operator shall attach 
documentation to the certification form that demonstrates the 
reliability and analytical soundness of the comparable formula and shall 
notify the Regional Administrator in writing that an alternative formula 
was used.

         Attachment C-III--Calculation of the Planning Distance

                            1.0  Introduction

    1.1  The facility owner or operator must evaluate whether the 
facility is located at a distance such that a discharge from the 
facility could cause injury to fish and wildlife and sensitive 
environments or disrupt operations at a public drinking water intake. To 
quantify that distance, EPA considered oil transport mechanisms over 
land and on still, tidal influence, and moving navigable waters. EPA has 
determined that the primary concern for calculation of a planning 
distance is the transport of oil in navigable waters during adverse 
weather conditions. Therefore, two formulas have been developed to 
determine distances for planning purposes from the point of discharge at 
the facility to the potential site of impact on moving and still waters, 
respectively. The formula for oil transport on moving navigable water is 
based on the velocity of the water body and the time interval for 
arrival of response resources. The still water formula accounts for the 
spread of discharged oil over the surface of the water. The method to 
determine oil transport on tidal influence areas is based on the type of 
oil spilled and the distance down current during ebb tide and up current 
during flood tide to the point of maximum tidal influence.
    1.2  EPA's formulas were designed to be simple to use. However, 
facility owners or operators may calculate planning distances using more 
sophisticated formulas, which take into account broader scientific or 
engineering principles, or local conditions. Such comparable formulas 
may result in different planning distances than EPA's formulas. In the 
event that an alternative formula that is comparable to one contained in 
this appendix is used to evaluate the criterion in 40 CFR 
112.20(f)(1)(ii)(B) or (f)(1)(ii)(C), the owner or operator shall attach 
documentation to the response plan cover sheet contained in Appendix F 
to this part that demonstrates the reliability and analytical soundness 
of the alternative formula and shall notify the Regional Administrator 
in

[[Page 315]]

writing that an alternative formula was used.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ For persistent oils or non-persistent oils, a worst case 
trajectory model (i.e., an alternative formula) may be substituted for 
the distance formulas described in still, moving, and tidal waters, 
subject to Regional Administrator's review of the model. An example of 
an alternative formula that is comparable to the one contained in this 
appendix would be a worst case trajectory calculation based on credible 
adverse winds, currents, and/or river stages, over a range of seasons, 
weather conditions, and river stages. Based on historical information or 
a spill trajectory model, the Agency may require that additional fish 
and wildlife and sensitive environments or public drinking water intakes 
also be protected.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1.3  A regulated facility may meet the criteria for the potential to 
cause substantial harm to the environment without having to perform a 
planning distance calculation. For facilities that meet the substantial 
harm criteria because of inadequate secondary containment or oil spill 
history, as listed in the flowchart in Attachment C-I to this appendix, 
calculation of the planning distance is unnecessary. For facilities that 
do not meet the substantial harm criteria for secondary containment or 
oil spill history as listed in the flowchart, calculation of a planning 
distance for proximity to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments 
and public drinking water intakes is required, unless it is clear 
without performing the calculation (e.g., the facility is located in a 
wetland) that these areas would be impacted.
    1.4  A facility owner or operator who must perform a planning 
distance calculation on navigable water is only required to do so for 
the type of navigable water conditions (i.e., moving water, still water, 
or tidal- influenced water) applicable to the facility. If a facility 
owner or operator determines that more than one type of navigable water 
condition applies, then the facility owner or operator is required to 
perform a planning distance calculation for each navigable water type to 
determine the greatest single distance that oil may be transported. As a 
result, the final planning distance for oil transport on water shall be 
the greatest individual distance rather than a summation of each 
calculated planning distance.
    1.5  The planning distance formula for transport on moving waterways 
contains three variables: the velocity of the navigable water (v), the 
response time interval (t), and a conversion factor (c). The velocity, 
v, is determined by using the Chezy-Manning equation, which, in this 
case, models the flood flow rate of water in open channels. The Chezy-
Manning equation contains three variables which must be determined by 
facility owners or operators. Manning's Roughness Coefficient (for flood 
flow rates), n, can be determined from Table 1 of this attachment. The 
hydraulic radius, r, can be estimated using the average mid-channel 
depth from charts provided by the sources listed in Table 2 of this 
attachment. The average slope of the river, s, can be determined using 
topographic maps that can be ordered from the U.S. Geological Survey, as 
listed in Table 2 of this attachment.
    1.6  Table 3 of this attachment contains specified time intervals 
for estimating the arrival of response resources at the scene of a 
discharge. Assuming no prior planning, response resources should be able 
to arrive at the discharge site within 12 hours of the discovery of any 
oil discharge in Higher Volume Port Areas and within 24 hours in Great 
Lakes and all other river, canal, inland, and nearshore areas. The 
specified time intervals in Table 3 of Appendix C are to be used only to 
aid in the identification of whether a facility could cause substantial 
harm to the environment. Once it is determined that a plan must be 
developed for the facility, the owner or operator shall reference 
Appendix E to this part to determine appropriate resource levels and 
response times. The specified time intervals of this appendix include a 
3-hour time period for deployment of boom and other response equipment. 
The Regional Administrator may identify additional areas as appropriate.

              2.0  Oil Transport on Moving Navigable Waters

    2.1  The facility owner or operator must use the following formula 
or a comparable formula as described in Sec. 112.20(a)(3) to calculate 
the planning distance for oil transport on moving navigable water:

d=v x t x c; where
d: the distance downstream from a facility within which fish and 
          wildlife and sensitive environments could be injured or a 
          public drinking water intake would be shut down in the event 
          of an oil discharge (in miles);
v: the velocity of the river/navigable water of concern (in ft/sec) as 
          determined by Chezy-Manning's equation (see below and Tables 1 
          and 2 of this attachment);
t: the time interval specified in Table 3 based upon the type of water 
          body and location (in hours); and
c: constant conversion factor 0.68 sec<bullet>mile/hr<bullet>ft (3600 
          sec/hr <divide> 5280 ft/mile).

    2.2 Chezy-Manning's equation is used to determine velocity:
v=1.5/n x r\2/3\ x s\1/2\; where
v=the velocity of the river of concern (in ft/sec);
n=Manning's Roughness Coefficient from Table 1 of this attachment;

[[Page 316]]

r=the hydraulic radius; the hydraulic radius can be approximated for 
          parabolic channels by multiplying the average mid-channel 
          depth of the river (in feet) by 0.667 (sources for obtaining 
          the mid-channel depth are listed in Table 2 of this 
          attachment); and
s=the average slope of the river (unitless) obtained from U.S. 
          Geological Survey topographic maps at the address listed in 
          Table 2 of this attachment.

Additional information can be obtained from the following sources:      
  1. The State's Department of Natural Resources (DNR) or the State's   
   Aids to Navigation office;                                           
  2. A knowledgeable local marina operator; or                          
  3. A knowledgeable local water authority (e.g., State water           
   commission)                                                          
                                                                        


    2.3  The average slope of the river (s) can be determined from the 
topographic maps using the following steps:
    (1) Locate the facility on the map.
    (2) Find the Normal Pool Elevation at the point of discharge from 
the facility into the water (A).
    (3) Find the Normal Pool Elevation of the public drinking water 
intake or fish and wildlife and sensitive environment located downstream 
(B) (Note: The owner or operator should use a minimum of 20 miles 
downstream as a cutoff to obtain the average slope if the location of a 
specific public drinking water intake or fish and wildlife and sensitive 
environment is unknown).
    (4) If the Normal Pool Elevation is not available, the elevation 
contours can be used to find the slope. Determine elevation of the water 
at the point of discharge from the facility (A). Determine the elevation 
of the water at the appropriate distance downstream (B). The formula 
presented below can be used to calculate the slope.
    (5) Determine the distance (in miles) between the facility and the 
public drinking water intake or fish and wildlife and sensitive 
environments (C).
    (6) Use the following formula to find the slope, which will be a 
unitless value: Average Slope=[(A-B) (ft)/C (miles)]  x  [1 mile/5280 
feet]
    2.4  If it is not feasible to determine the slope and mid-channel 
depth by the Chezy-Manning equation, then the river velocity can be 
approximated on- site. A specific length, such as 100 feet, can be 
marked off along the shoreline. A float can be dropped into the stream 
above the mark, and the time required for the float to travel the 
distance can be used to determine the velocity in feet per second. 
However, this method will not yield an average velocity for the length 
of the stream, but a velocity only for the specific location of 
measurement. In addition, the flow rate will vary depending on weather 
conditions such as wind and rainfall. It is recommended that facility 
owners or operators repeat the measurement under a variety of conditions 
to obtain the most accurate estimate of the surface water velocity under 
adverse weather conditions.
    2.5  The planning distance calculations for moving and still 
navigable waters are based on worst case discharges of persistent oils. 
Persistent oils are of concern because they can remain in the water for 
significant periods of time and can potentially exist in large 
quantities downstream. Owners or operators of facilities that store 
persistent as well as non-persistent oils may use a comparable formula. 
The volume of oil discharged is not included as part of the planning 
distance calculation for moving navigable waters. Facilities that will 
meet this substantial harm criterion are those with facility capacities 
greater than or equal to 1 million gallons. It is assumed that these 
facilities are capable of having an oil discharge of sufficient quantity 
to cause injury to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments or shut 
down a public drinking water intake. While owners or operators of 
transfer facilities that store greater than or equal to 42,000 gallons 
are not required to use a planning distance formula for purposes of the 
substantial harm criteria, they should use a planning distance 
calculation in the development of facility-specific response plans.

    2.6  Example of the Planning Distance Calculation for Oil Transport 
on Moving Navigable Waters. The following example provides a sample 
calculation using the planning distance formula for a facility 
discharging oil into the Monongahela River:
    (1) Solve for v by evaluating n, r, and s for the Chezy-Manning 
equation:
    Find the roughness coefficient, n, on Table 1 of this attachment for 
a regular section of a major stream with a top width greater than 100 
feet. The top width of the river can be found from the topographic map.

n=0.035.
Find slope, s, where A=727 feet, B=710 feet, and C=25 miles.

Solving:
s=[(727 ft-1710 ft)/25 miles] x [1 mile/5280 feet]=1.3 x 10<SUP>-4

    The average mid-channel depth is found by averaging the mid-channel 
depth for each mile along the length of the river between

[[Page 318]]

the facility and the public drinking water intake or the fish or 
wildlife or sensitive environment (or 20 miles downstream if 
applicable). This value is multiplied by 0.667 to obtain the hydraulic 
radius. The mid-channel depth is found by obtaining values for r and s 
from the sources shown in Table 2 for the Monongahela River.

Solving:
r=0.667 x 20 feet=13.33 feet
Solve for v using:
v=1.5/n x r<SUP>2/3 x s<SUP>1/2:
v=[1.5/0.035] x (13.33)<SUP>2/3 x (1.3 x 10<SUP>-4)<SUP>1/2
v=2.73 feet/second
    (2) Find t from Table 3 of this attachment. The Monongahela River's 
resource response time is 27 hours.
    (3) Solve for planning distance, d:

d=v x t x c
d=(2.73 ft/sec) x (27 hours) x (0.68 sec<bullet>mile/hr<bullet>ft)
d=50 miles

Therefore, 50 miles downstream is the appropriate planning distance for 
this facility.

                    3.0  Oil Transport on Still Water

    3.1  For bodies of water including lakes or ponds that do not have a 
measurable velocity, the spreading of the oil over the surface must be 
considered. Owners or operators of facilities located next to still 
water bodies may use a comparable means of calculating the planning 
distance. If a comparable formula is used, documentation of the 
reliability and analytical soundness of the comparable calculation must 
be attached to the response plan cover sheet.
    3.2  Example of the Planning Distance Calculation for Oil Transport 
on Still Water. To assist those facilities which could potentially 
discharge into a still body of water, the following analysis was 
performed to provide an example of the type of formula that may be used 
to calculate the planning distance. For this example, a worst case 
discharge of 2,000,000 gallons is used.
    (1) The surface area in square feet covered by an oil spill on still 
water, A1, can be determined by the following formula,\2\ where V is the 
volume of the spill in gallons and C is a constant conversion factor:

    \2\ Huang, J.C. and Monastero, F.C., 1982. Review of the State-of-
the-Art of Oil Pollution Models. Final report submitted to the American 
Petroleum Institute by Raytheon Ocean Systems, Co., East Providence, 
Rhode Island.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A<INF>1=10<SUP>5 x V\<SUP>3/4\ x C
C=0.1643
A<INF>1=10<SUP>5 x (2,000,000 gallons)\<SUP>3/4\ x (0.1643)
A<INF>1=8.74 x 10<SUP>8 ft<SUP>2
    (2) The spreading formula is based on the theoretical condition that 
the oil will spread uniformly in all directions forming a circle. In 
reality, the outfall of the discharge will direct the oil to the surface 
of the water where it intersects the shoreline. Although the oil will 
not spread uniformly in all directions, it is assumed that the discharge 
will spread from the shoreline into a semi-circle (this assumption does 
not account for winds or wave action).
    (3) The area of a circle=<dagger>r<SUP>2
    (4) To account for the assumption that oil will spread in a semi-
circular shape, the area of a circle is divided by 2 and is designated 
as A<INF>2.

A<INF>2=(<dagger>r<SUP>2)/2
Solving for the radius, r, using the relationship A<INF>1=A<INF>2: 
          8.74 x 10<SUP>8 ft<SUP>2=(<dagger><SUP>2)/2
Therefore, r=23,586 ft
r=23,586 ft<divide>5,280 ft/mile=4.5 miles
Assuming a 20 knot wind under storm conditions:
1 knot=1.15 miles/hour
20 knots x 1.15 miles/hour/knot=23 miles/hr
Assuming that the oil slick moves at 3 percent of the wind's speed:\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Oil Spill Prevention & Control. National Spill Control School, 
Corpus Christi State University, Thirteenth Edition, May 1990.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

23 miles/hour x 0.03=0.69 miles/hour

    (5) To estimate the distance that the oil will travel, use the times 
required for response resources to arrive at different geographic 
locations as shown in Table 3 of this attachment.

For example:
For Higher Volume Port Areas: 15 hrs x 0.69 miles/hr=10.4 miles
For Great Lakes and all other areas: 27 hrs x 0.69 miles/hr=18.6 miles
    (6) The total distance that the oil will travel from the point of 
discharge, including the distance due to spreading, is calculated as 
follows:

Higher Volume Port Areas: d=10.4+4.5 miles or approximately 15 miles
Great Lakes and all other areas: d=18.6+4.5 miles or approximately 23 
          miles

               4.0  Oil Transport on Tidal-Influence Areas

    4.1  The planning distance method for tidal influence navigable 
water is based on worst case discharges of persistent and non-persistent 
oils. Persistent oils are of primary concern because they can 
potentially cause harm over a greater distance. For persistent oils 
discharged into tidal waters, the planning distance is 15 miles from the 
facility down current during ebb tide and to the point of maximum tidal 
influence or 15 miles, whichever is less, during flood tide.
    4.2  For non-persistent oils discharged into tidal waters, the 
planning distance is 5 miles from the facility down current during ebb 
tide and to the point of maximum tidal influence or 5 miles, whichever 
is less, during flood tide.

[[Page 319]]

    4.3  Example of Determining the Planning Distance for Two Types of 
Navigable Water Conditions. Below is an example of how to determine the 
proper planning distance when a facility could impact two types of 
navigable water conditions: moving water and tidal water.
    (1) Facility X stores persistent oil and is located downstream from 
locks along a slow moving river which is affected by tides. The river 
velocity, v, is determined to be 0.5 feet/second from the Chezy-Manning 
equation used to calculate oil transport on moving navigable waters. The 
specified time interval, t, obtained from Table 3 of this attachment for 
river areas is 27 hours. Therefore, solving for the planning distance, 
d:

d=v x t x c
d=(0.5 ft/sec) x (27 hours) x (0.68 sec\mile/hr\ft)
d=9.18 miles.

    (2) However, the planning distance for maximum tidal influence down 
current during ebb tide is 15 miles, which is greater than the 
calculated 9.18 miles. Therefore, 15 miles downstream is the appropriate 
planning distance for this facility.

                      5.0  Oil Transport Over Land

    5.1  Facility owners or operators must evaluate the potential for 
oil to be transported over land to navigable waters of the United 
States. The owner or operator must evaluate the likelihood that portions 
of a worst case discharge would reach navigable waters via open channel 
flow or from sheet flow across the land, or be prevented from reaching 
navigable waters when trapped in natural or man-made depressions 
excluding secondary containment structures.
    5.2  As discharged oil travels over land, it may enter a storm drain 
or open concrete channel intended for drainage. It is assumed that once 
oil reaches such an inlet, it will flow into the receiving navigable 
water. During a storm event, it is highly probable that the oil will 
either flow into the drainage structures or follow the natural contours 
of the land and flow into the navigable water. Expected minimum and 
maximum velocities are provided as examples of open concrete channel and 
pipe flow. The ranges listed below reflect minimum and maximum 
velocities used as design criteria.\4\ The calculation below 
demonstrates that the time required for oil to travel through a storm 
drain or open concrete channel to navigable water is negligible and can 
be considered instantaneous. The velocities are:

    \4\ The design velocities were obtained from Howard County, Maryland 
Department of Public Works' Storm Drainage Design Manual.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

For open concrete channels:
maximum velocity=25 feet per second
minimum velocity=3 feet per second
For storm drains:
maximum velocity=25 feet per second
minimum velocity=2 feet per second

    5.3  Assuming a length of 0.5 mile from the point of discharge 
through an open concrete channel or concrete storm drain to a navigable 
water, the travel times (distance/velocity) are:

1.8 minutes at a velocity of 25 feet per second
14.7 minutes at a velocity of 3 feet per second
22.0 minutes for at a velocity of 2 feet per second

    5.4  The distances that shall be considered to determine the 
planning distance are illustrated in Figure C-I of this attachment. The 
relevant distances can be described as follows:

D1=Distance from the nearest opportunity for discharge, X<INF>1, to a 
          storm drain or an open concrete channel leading to navigable 
          water.
D2=Distance through the storm drain or open concrete channel to 
          navigable water.
D3=Distance downstream from the outfall within which fish and wildlife 
          and sensitive environments could be injured or a public 
          drinking water intake would be shut down as determined by the 
          planning distance formula.
D4=Distance from the nearest opportunity for discharge, X<INF>2, to fish 
          and wildlife and sensitive environments not bordering 
          navigable water.

    5.5  A facility owner or operator whose nearest opportunity for 
discharge is located within 0.5 mile of a navigable water must complete 
the planning distance calculation (D3) for the type of navigable water 
near the facility or use a comparable formula.
    5.6  A facility that is located at a distance greater than 0.5 mile 
from a navigable water must also calculate a planning distance (D3) if 
it is in close proximity (i.e., D1 is less than 0.5 mile and other 
factors are conducive to oil travel over land) to storm drains that flow 
to navigable waters. Factors to be considered in assessing oil transport 
over land to storm drains shall include the topography of the 
surrounding area, drainage patterns, man-made barriers (excluding 
secondary containment structures), and soil distribution and porosity. 
Storm drains or concrete drainage channels that are located in close 
proximity to the facility can provide a direct pathway to navigable 
waters, regardless of the length of the drainage pipe. If D1 is less 
than or equal to 0.5 mile, a discharge from the facility could pose 
substantial harm because the time to travel the distance from the storm 
drain to the navigable water (D2) is virtually instantaneous.

[[Page 320]]

    5.7  A facility's proximity to fish and wildlife and sensitive 
environments not bordering a navigable water, as depicted as D4 in 
Figure C-I of this attachment, must also be considered, regardless of 
the distance from the facility to navigable waters. Factors to be 
considered in assessing oil transport over land to fish and wildlife and 
sensitive environments should include the topography of the surrounding 
area, drainage patterns, man-made barriers (excluding secondary 
containment structures), and soil distribution and porosity.
    5.8  If a facility is not found to pose substantial harm to fish and 
wildlife and sensitive environments not bordering navigable waters via 
oil transport on land, then supporting documentation should be 
maintained at the facility. However, such documentation should be 
submitted with the response plan if a facility is found to pose 
substantial harm.

Appendix D to Part 112--Determination of a Worst Case Discharge Planning 
                                 Volume

                            1.0  Instructions

    1.1  An owner or operator is required to complete this worksheet if 
the facility meets the criteria, as presented in Appendix C to this 
part, or it is determined by the RA that the facility could cause 
substantial harm to the environment. The calculation of a worst case 
discharge planning volume is used for emergency planning purposes, and 
is required in 40 CFR 112.20 for facility owners or operators who must 
prepare a response plan. When planning for the amount of resources and 
equipment necessary to respond to the worst case discharge planning 
volume, adverse weather conditions must be taken into consideration. An 
owner or operator is required to determine the facility's worst case 
discharge planning volume from either Part A of this appendix for an 
onshore storage facility, or Part B of this appendix for an onshore 
production facility. The worksheet considers the provision of adequate 
secondary containment at a facility.
    1.2  For onshore storage facilities and production facilities, 
permanently manifolded oil storage tanks are defined as tanks that are 
designed, installed, and/or operated in such a manner that the multiple 
tanks function as one storage unit (i.e., multiple tank volumes are 
equalized). In a worst case discharge scenario, a single failure could 
cause the discharge of the contents of more than one tank. The owner or 
operator must provide evidence in the response plan that tanks with 
common piping or piping systems are not operated as one unit. If such 
evidence is provided and is acceptable to the RA, the worst case 
discharge planning volume would be based on the capacity of the largest 
oil storage tank within a common secondary containment area or the 
largest oil storage tank within a single secondary containment area, 
whichever is greater. For permanently manifolded tanks that function as 
one oil storage unit, the worst case discharge planning volume would be 
based on the combined oil storage capacity of all manifolded tanks or 
the capacity of the largest single oil storage tank within a secondary 
containment area, whichever is greater. For purposes of this rule, 
permanently manifolded tanks that are separated by internal divisions 
for each tank are considered to be single tanks and individual 
manifolded tank volumes are not combined.
    1.3  For production facilities, the presence of exploratory wells, 
production wells, and oil storage tanks must be considered in the 
calculation. Part B of this appendix takes these additional factors into 
consideration and provides steps for their inclusion in the total worst 
case discharge planning volume. Onshore oil production facilities may 
include all wells, flowlines, separation equipment, storage facilities, 
gathering lines, and auxiliary non-transportation-related equipment and 
facilities in a single geographical oil or gas field operated by a 
single operator. Although a potential worst case discharge planning 
volume is calculated within each section of the worksheet, the final 
worst case amount depends on the risk parameter that results in the 
greatest volume.
    1.4  Marine transportation-related transfer facilities that contain 
fixed aboveground onshore structures used for bulk oil storage are 
jointly regulated by EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), and are termed 
``complexes.'' Because the USCG also requires response plans from 
transportation-related facilities to address a worst case discharge of 
oil, a separate calculation for the worst case discharge planning volume 
for USCG-related facilities is included in the USCG IFR (see Appendix E 
to this part, section 10, for availability). All complexes that are 
jointly regulated by EPA and the USCG must compare both calculations for 
worst case discharge planning volume derived by using the EPA and USCG 
methodologies and plan for whichever volume is greater.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ ``Storage facilities'' represent all facilities subject to this 
part, excluding oil production facilities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Part A of this worksheet is to be completed by the owner or operator 
of an SPCC-regulated facility (excluding oil production facilities) if 
the facility meets the criteria as presented in Appendix C to this part, 
or if it is determined by the RA that the facility could cause 
substantial harm to the environment. If you are the owner or operator of 
a production facility, please proceed to Part B of this worksheet.

                       A.1  SINGLE-TANK FACILITIES

    For facilities containing only one aboveground oil storage tank, the 
worst case discharge planning volume equals the capacity of the oil 
storage tank. If adequate secondary containment (sufficiently large to 
contain the capacity of the aboveground oil storage tank plus sufficient 
freeboard to allow for precipitation) exists for the oil storage tank, 
multiply the capacity of the tank by 0.8.

storage tanks at the facility without adequate secondary containment?

    \2\ Secondary containment is defined in 40 CFR 112.7(e)(2). 
Acceptable methods and structures for containment are also given in 40 
CFR 112.7(c)(1).

  PART B: WORST CASE DISCHARGE PLANNING VOLUME CALCULATION FOR ONSHORE 
                          PRODUCTION FACILITIES

    Part B of this worksheet is to be completed by the owner or operator 
of an SPCC-regulated oil production facility if the facility meets the 
criteria presented in Appendix C to this part, or if it is determined by 
the RA that the facility could cause substantial harm. A production 
facility consists of all wells (producing and exploratory) and related 
equipment in a single geographical oil or gas field operated by a single 
operator.

                       B.1  SINGLE-TANK FACILITIES

    B.1.1  For facilities containing only one aboveground oil storage 
tank, the worst case discharge planning volume equals the capacity of 
the aboveground oil storage tank plus the production volume of the well 
with the highest output at the facility. If adequate secondary 
containment (sufficiently large to contain the capacity of the 
aboveground oil storage tank plus sufficient freeboard to allow for 
precipitation) exists for the storage tank, multiply the capacity of the 
tank by 0.8.
    B.1.2  For facilities with production wells producing by pumping, if 
the rate of the well with the highest output is known and the number of 
days the facility is unattended can be predicted, then the production 
volume is equal to the pumping rate of the well multiplied by the 
greatest number of days the facility is unattended.
    B.1.3  If the pumping rate of the well with the highest output is 
estimated or the maximum number of days the facility is unattended is 
estimated, then the production volume is determined from the pumping 
rate of the well multiplied by 1.5 times the greatest number of days 
that the facility has been or is expected to be unattended.

wells producing under pressure.

    Are all aboveground oil storage tanks or groups of aboveground oil 
storage tanks at the facility without adequate secondary containment?

______ (Y/N)

    B.2.1  If the answer is yes, the final worst case volume equals the 
total aboveground oil storage capacity without adequate secondary 
containment plus the production volume of the well with the highest 
output at the facility.
    (1) For facilities with production wells producing by pumping, if 
the rate of the well with the highest output is known and the number of 
days the facility is unattended can be predicted, then the production 
volume is equal to the pumping rate of the well multiplied by the 
greatest number of days the facility is unattended.
    (2) If the pumping rate of the well with the highest output is 
estimated or the maximum number of days the facility is unattended is

 Attachment D-I--Methods to Calculate Production Volumes for Production 
 Facilities With Exploratory Wells or Production Wells Producing Under 
                                Pressure

                            1.0  Introduction

    The owner or operator of a production facility with exploratory 
wells or production wells producing under pressure shall compare the 
well rate of the highest output well (rate of well), in barrels per day, 
to the ability of response equipment and personnel to recover the volume 
of oil that could be discharged (rate of recovery), in barrels per day. 
The result of this comparison will determine the method used to 
calculate the production volume for the production facility. This 
production volume is to be used to calculate the worst case discharge 
planning volume in Part B of this appendix.

                       2.0  Description of Methods

    2.1  Method A
    If the well rate would overwhelm the response efforts (i.e., rate of 
well/rate of recovery <gr-thn-eq> 1), then the production volume would 
be the 30-day forecasted well rate for a well 10,000 feet deep or less, 
or the 45-day forecasted well rate for a well deeper than 10,000 feet.
    (1) For wells 10,000 feet deep or less:
Production volume=30 days  x  rate of well.
    (2) For wells deeper than 10,000 feet:
Production volume=45 days  x  rate of well.
    2.2  Method B
    2.2.1  If the rate of recovery would be greater than the well rate 
(i.e., rate of well/rate of recovery <1), then the production volume 
would equal the sum of two terms:

Production volume=discharge volume<INF>1 + discharge volume<INF>2

    2.2.2  The first term represents the volume of the oil discharged 
from the well between the time of the blowout and the time the response 
resources are on scene and recovering oil (discharge volume<INF>1).

Discharge volume<INF>1=(days unattended+days to respond)  x  (rate of 
          well)

    2.2.3  The second term represents the volume of oil discharged from 
the well after the response resources begin operating until the spill is 
stopped, adjusted for the recovery rate of the response resources 
(discharge volume<INF>2).
    (1) For wells 10,000 feet deep or less:
Discharge volume<INF>2=[30 days-(days unattended + days to respond)]  x  
          (rate of well)  x  (rate of well/rate of recovery)
    (2) For wells deeper than 10,000 feet:
Discharge volume<INF>2=[45 days-(days unattended + days to respond)]  x  
          (rate of well)  x  (rate of well/rate of recovery)

                              3.0  Example

    3.1  A facility consists of two production wells producing under 
pressure, which are both less than 10,000 feet deep. The well rate of 
well A is 5 barrels per day, and the well rate of well B is 10 barrels 
per day. The facility is unattended for a maximum of 7 days. The 
facility operator estimates that it will take 2 days to have response 
equipment and personnel on scene and responding to a blowout, and that 
the projected rate of recovery will be 20 barrels per day.
    (1) First, the facility operator determines that the highest output 
well is well B. The facility operator calculates the ratio of the rate 
of well to the rate of recovery:

10 barrels per day/20 barrels per day=0.5 Because the ratio is less than 
          one, the facility operator will use Method B to calculate the 
          production volume.
    (2) The first term of the equation is:

Discharge volume<INF>1=(7 days + 2 days)  x  (10 barrels per day)=90 
          barrels

    (3) The second term of the equation is:

Discharge volume<INF>2=[30 days--(7 days + 2 days)]  x  (10 barrels per 
          day)  x  (0.5)=105 barrels

    (4) Therefore, the production volume is:

Production volume=90 barrels + 105 barrels=195 barrels

    3.2  If the recovery rate was 5 barrels per day, the ratio of rate 
of well to rate of recovery would be 2, so the facility operator would

[[Page 325]]

use Method A. The production volume would have been:

30 days  x  10 barrels per day=300 barrels

    Appendix E to Part 112--Determination and Evaluation of Required 
             Response Resources for Facility Response Plans

                      1.0  Purpose and Definitions

    1.1  The purpose of this appendix is to describe the procedures to 
identify response resources to meet the requirements of Sec. 112.20. To 
identify response resources to meet the facility response plan 
requirements of 40 CFR 112.20(h), owners or operators shall follow this 
appendix or, where not appropriate, shall clearly demonstrate in the 
response plan why use of this appendix is not appropriate at the 
facility and make comparable arrangements for response resources.
    1.2  Definitions.
    1.2.1  Nearshore is an operating area defined as extending seaward 
12 miles from the boundary lines defined in 46 CFR part 7, except in the 
Gulf of Mexico. In the Gulf of Mexico, it means the area extending 12 
miles from the line of demarcation (COLREG lines) defined in 49 CFR 
80.740 and 80.850.
    1.2.2  Non-persistent oils or Group 1 oils include:
    (1) A petroleum-based oil that, at the time of shipment, consists of 
hydrocarbon fractions:
    (A) At least 50 percent of which by volume, distill at a temperature 
of 340 degrees C (645 degrees F); and
    (B) At least 95 percent of which by volume, distill at a temperature 
of 370 degrees C (700 degrees F); and
    (2) A non-petroleum oil with a specific gravity less than 0.8.
    1.2.3  Non-petroleum oil is oil of any kind that is not petroleum-
based. It includes, but is not limited to, animal and vegetable oils.
    1.2.4  Ocean means the nearshore area.
    1.2.5  Operating area means Rivers and Canals, Inland, Nearshore, 
and Great Lakes geographic location(s) in which a facility is handling, 
storing, or transporting oil.
    1.2.6  Operating environment means Rivers and Canals, Inland, Great 
Lakes, or Ocean. These terms are used to define the conditions in which 
response equipment is designed to function.
    1.2.7  Persistent oils include:
    (1) A petroleum-based oil that does not meet the distillation 
criteria for a non-persistent oil. Persistent oils are further 
classified based on specific gravity as follows:
    (A) Group 2--specific gravity less than 0.85;
    (B) Group 3--specific gravity equal to or greater than 0.85 and less 
than 0.95;
    (C) Group 4--specific gravity equal to or greater than 0.95 and less 
than 1.0; or
    (D) Group 5--specific gravity equal to or greater than 1.0.
    (2) A non-petroleum oil with a specific gravity of 0.8 or greater. 
These oils are further classified based on specific gravity as follows:
    (A) Group 2--specific gravity equal to or greater than 0.8 and less 
than 0.85;
    (B) Group 3--specific gravity equal to or greater than 0.85 and less 
than 0.95;
    (C) Group 4--specific gravity equal to or greater than 0.95 and less 
than 1.0; or
    (D) Group 5--specific gravity equal to or greater than 1.0.
    1.2.8  Other definitions are included in Sec. 112.2 and section 1.1 
of Appendix C.

                2.0  Equipment Operability and Readiness

    2.1  All equipment identified in a response plan must be designed to 
operate in the conditions expected in the facility's geographic area 
(i.e., operating environment). These conditions vary widely based on 
location and season. Therefore, it is difficult to identify a single 
stockpile of response equipment that will function effectively in each 
geographic location (i.e., operating area).
    2.2  Facilities handling, storing, or transporting oil in more than 
one operating environment as indicated in Table 1 of this appendix must 
identify equipment capable of successfully functioning in each operating 
environment.
    2.3  When identifying equipment for the response plan (based on the 
use of this appendix), a facility owner or operator must consider the 
inherent limitations of the operability of equipment components and 
response systems. The criteria in Table 1 of this appendix shall be used 
to evaluate the operability in a given environment. These criteria 
reflect the general conditions in certain operating environments.
    2.3.1  The Regional Administrator may require documentation that the 
boom identified in a facility response plan meets the criteria in Table 
1 of this appendix. Absent acceptable documentation, the Regional 
Administrator may require that the boom be tested to demonstrate that it 
meets the criteria in Table 1 of this appendix. Testing must be in 
accordance with ASTM F 715, ASTM F 989, or other tests approved by EPA 
as deemed appropriate (see Appendix E to this part, section 10, for 
general availability of documents).
    2.4  Table 1 of this appendix lists criteria for oil recovery 
devices and boom. All other equipment necessary to sustain or support 
response operations in an operating environment must be designed to 
function in the same conditions. For example, boats that deploy or 
support skimmers or boom must be

[[Page 326]]

capable of being safely operated in the significant wave heights listed 
for the applicable operating environment.
    2.5  A facility owner or operator shall refer to the applicable Area 
Contingency Plan (ACP), where available, to determine if ice, debris, 
and weather-related visibility are significant factors to evaluate the 
operability of equipment. The ACP may also identify the average 
temperature ranges expected in the facility's operating area. All 
equipment identified in a response plan must be designed to operate 
within those conditions or ranges.
    2.6  This appendix provides information on response resource 
mobilization and response times. The distance of the facility from the 
storage location of the response resources must be used to determine 
whether the resources can arrive on-scene within the stated time. A 
facility owner or operator shall include the time for notification, 
mobilization, and travel of resources identified to meet the medium and 
Tier 1 worst case discharge requirements identified in section 4.3 of 
this appendix (for medium discharges) and section 5.3 of this appendix 
(for worst case discharges). The facility owner or operator must plan 
for notification and mobilization of Tier 2 and 3 response resources as 
necessary to meet the requirements for arrival on-scene in accordance 
with section 5.3 of this appendix. An on-water speed of 5 knots and a 
land speed of 35 miles per hour is assumed, unless the facility owner or 
operator can demonstrate otherwise.
    2.7  In identifying equipment, the facility owner or operator shall 
list the storage location, quantity, and manufacturer's make and model. 
For oil recovery devices, the effective daily recovery capacity, as 
determined using section 6 of this appendix, must be included. For boom, 
the overall boom height (draft and freeboard) shall be included. A 
facility owner or operator is responsible for ensuring that the 
identified boom has compatible connectors.

    3.0  Determining Response Resources Required for Small Discharges

    3.1  A facility owner or operator shall identify sufficient response 
resources available, by contract or other approved means as described in 
Sec. 112.2, to respond to a small discharge. A small discharge is 
defined as any discharge volume less than or equal to 2,100 gallons, but 
not to exceed the calculated worst case discharge. The equipment must be 
designed to function in the operating environment at the point of 
expected use.
    3.2  Complexes that are regulated by EPA and the USCG must also 
consider planning quantities for the transportation-related transfer 
portion of the facility. The USCG planning level that corresponds to 
EPA's ``small discharge'' is termed ``the average most probable 
discharge.'' The USCG revisions to 33 CFR part 154 define ``the average 
most probable discharge'' as a discharge of 50 barrels (2,100 gallons). 
Owners or operators of complexes must compare oil spill volumes for a 
small discharge and an average most probable discharge and plan for 
whichever quantity is greater.
    3.3  The response resources shall, as appropriate, include:
    3.3.1  One thousand feet of containment boom (or, for complexes with 
marine transfer components, 1,000 feet of containment boom or two times 
the length of the largest vessel that regularly conducts oil transfers 
to or from the facility, whichever is greater), and a means of deploying 
it within 1 hour of the discovery of a spill;
    3.3.2  Oil recovery devices with an effective daily recovery 
capacity equal to the amount of oil discharged in a small discharge or 
greater which is available at the facility within 2 hours of the 
detection of an oil discharge; and
    3.3.3  Oil storage capacity for recovered oily material indicated in 
section 9.2 of this appendix.

   4.0  Determining Response Resources Required for Medium Discharges

    4.1  A facility owner or operator shall identify sufficient response 
resources available, by contract or other approved means as described in 
Sec. 112.2, to respond to a medium discharge of oil for that facility. 
This will require response resources capable of containing and 
collecting up to 36,000 gallons of oil or 10 percent of the worst case 
discharge, whichever is less. All equipment identified must be designed 
to operate in the applicable operating environment specified in Table 1 
of this appendix.
    4.2  Complexes that are regulated by EPA and the USCG must also 
consider planning quantities for the transportation-related transfer 
portion of the facility. The USCG planning level that corresponds to 
EPA's ``medium discharge'' is termed ``the maximum most probable 
discharge.'' The USCG revisions to 33 CFR part 154 define ``the maximum 
most probable discharge'' as a discharge of 1,200 barrels (50,400 
gallons) or 10 percent of the worst case discharge, whichever is less. 
Owners or operators of complexes must compare spill volumes for a medium 
discharge and a maximum most probable discharge and plan for whichever 
quantity is greater.
    4.3  Oil recovery devices identified to meet the applicable medium 
discharge volume planning criteria must be located such that they are 
capable of arriving on-scene within 6 hours in higher volume port areas 
and the Great Lakes and within 12 hours in all other areas. Higher 
volume port areas and Great Lakes areas are defined in section 1.1 of 
Appendix C to this part.
    4.4  Because rapid control, containment, and removal of oil are 
critical to reduce spill

[[Page 327]]

impact, the owner or operator must determine response resources using an 
effective daily recovery capacity for oil recovery devices equal to 50 
percent of the planning volume applicable for the facility as determined 
in section 4.1 of this appendix. The effective daily recovery capacity 
for oil recovery devices identified in the plan must be determined using 
the criteria in section 6 of this appendix.
    4.5  In addition to oil recovery capacity, the plan shall, as 
appropriate, identify sufficient quantity of containment boom available, 
by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, to 
arrive within the required response times for oil collection and 
containment and for protection of fish and wildlife and sensitive 
environments. For further description of fish and wildlife and sensitive 
environments, see Appendices I, II, and III to DOC/NOAA's ``Guidance for 
Facility and Vessel Response Plans: Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive 
Environments'' (see Appendix E to this part, section 10, for 
availability) and the applicable ACP. While the regulation does not set 
required quantities of boom for oil collection and containment, the 
response plan shall identify and ensure, by contract or other approved 
means as described in Sec. 112.2, the availability of the quantity of 
boom identified in the plan for this purpose.
    4.6  The plan must indicate the availability of temporary storage 
capacity to meet section 9.2 of this appendix. If available storage 
capacity is insufficient to meet this level, then the effective daily 
recovery capacity must be derated (downgraded) to the limits of the 
available storage capacity.
    4.7  The following is an example of a medium discharge volume 
planning calculation for equipment identification in a higher volume 
port area: The facility's largest aboveground storage tank volume is 
840,000 gallons. Ten percent of this capacity is 84,000 gallons. Because 
10 percent of the facility's largest tank, or 84,000 gallons, is greater 
than 36,000 gallons, 36,000 gallons is used as the planning volume. The 
effective daily recovery capacity is 50 percent of the planning volume, 
or 18,000 gallons per day. The ability of oil recovery devices to meet 
this capacity must be calculated using the procedures in section 6 of 
this appendix. Temporary storage capacity available on-scene must equal 
twice the daily recovery capacity as indicated in section 9.2 of this 
appendix, or 36,000 gallons per day. This is the information the 
facility owner or operator must use to identify and ensure the 
availability of the required response resources, by contract or other 
approved means as described in Sec. 112.2. The facility owner shall also 
identify how much boom is available for use.

    5.0  Determining Response Resources Required for the Worst Case 
               Discharge to the Maximum Extent Practicable

    5.1  A facility owner or operator shall identify and ensure the 
availability of, by contract or other approved means as described in 
Sec. 112.2, sufficient response resources to respond to the worst case 
discharge of oil to the maximum extent practicable. Section 7 of this 
appendix describes the method to determine the necessary response 
resources. A worksheet is provided as Attachment E-1 at the end of this 
appendix to simplify the procedures involved in calculating the planning 
volume for response resources for the worst case discharge.
    5.2  Complexes that are regulated by EPA and the USCG must also 
consider planning for the worst case discharge at the transportation-
related portion of the facility. The USCG requires that transportation-
related facility owners or operators use a different calculation for the 
worst case discharge in the revisions to 33 CFR part 154. Owners or 
operators of complex facilities that are regulated by EPA and the USCG 
must compare both calculations of worst case discharge derived by EPA 
and the USCG and plan for whichever volume is greater.
    5.3  Oil spill response resources identified in the response plan 
and available, by contract or other approved means as described in 
Sec. 112.2, to meet the applicable worst case discharge planning volume 
must be located such that they are capable of arriving at the scene of a 
discharge within the times specified for the applicable response tier 
listed below:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   Tier 1        Tier 2        Tier 3   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Higher volume port areas.....  6 hrs........  30 hrs......  54 hrs      
Great Lakes..................  12 hrs.......  36 hrs......  60 hrs      
All other river and canal,     12 hrs.......  36 hrs......  60 hrs      
 inland, and nearshore areas.                                           
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The three levels of response tiers apply to the amount of time in which 
facility owners or operators must plan for response resources to arrive 
at the scene of a spill to respond to the worst case discharge planning 
volume. For example, at a worst case discharge in an inland area, the 
first tier of response resources (i.e., that amount of on-water and 
shoreline cleanup capacity necessary to respond to the fraction of the 
worst case discharge as indicated through the series of steps described 
in sections 7.2 and 7.3 of this appendix) would arrive at the scene of 
the discharge within 12 hours; the second tier of response resources 
would arrive within 36 hours; and the third tier of response resources 
would arrive within 60 hours.

[[Page 328]]

    5.4  The effective daily recovery capacity for oil recovery devices 
identified in the response plan must be determined using the criteria in 
section 6 of this appendix. A facility owner or operator shall identify 
the storage locations of all response resources used for each tier. The 
owner or operator of a facility whose required daily recovery capacity 
exceeds the applicable contracting caps in Table 5 of this appendix 
shall, as appropriate, identify sources of additional equipment, their 
location, and the arrangements made to obtain this equipment during a 
response. The owner or operator of a facility whose calculated planning 
volume exceeds the applicable contracting caps in Table 5 of this 
appendix shall, as appropriate, identify sources of additional equipment 
equal to twice the cap listed in Tier 3 or the amount necessary to reach 
the calculated planning volume, whichever is lower. The resources 
identified above the cap shall be capable of arriving on-scene not later 
than the Tier 3 response times in section 5.3 of this appendix. No 
contract is required. While general listings of available response 
equipment may be used to identify additional sources (i.e., ``public'' 
resources vs. ``private'' resources), the response plan shall identify 
the specific sources, locations, and quantities of equipment that a 
facility owner or operator has considered in his or her planning. When 
listing USCG-classified oil spill removal organization(s) that have 
sufficient removal capacity to recover the volume above the response 
capacity cap for the specific facility, as specified in Table 5 of this 
appendix, it is not necessary to list specific quantities of equipment.
    5.5  A facility owner or operator shall identify the availability of 
temporary storage capacity to meet section 9.2 of this appendix. If 
available storage capacity is insufficient, then the effective daily 
recovery capacity must be derated (downgraded) to the limits of the 
available storage capacity.
    5.6  When selecting response resources necessary to meet the 
response plan requirements, the facility owner or operator shall, as 
appropriate, ensure that a portion of those resources is capable of 
being used in close-to-shore response activities in shallow water. For 
any EPA-regulated facility that is required to plan for response in 
shallow water, at least 20 percent of the on-water response equipment 
identified for the applicable operating area shall, as appropriate, be 
capable of operating in water of 6 feet or less depth.
    5.7  In addition to oil spill recovery devices, a facility owner or 
operator shall identify sufficient quantities of boom that are 
available, by contract or other approved means as described in 
Sec. 112.2, to arrive on-scene within the specified response times for 
oil containment and collection. The specific quantity of boom required 
for collection and containment will depend on the facility-specific 
information and response strategies employed. A facility owner or 
operator shall, as appropriate, also identify sufficient quantities of 
oil containment boom to protect fish and wildlife and sensitive 
environments. For further description of fish and wildlife and sensitive 
environments, see Appendices I, II, and III to DOC/NOAA's ``Guidance for 
Facility and Vessel Response Plans: Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive 
Environments'' (see Appendix E to this part, section 10, for 
availability), and the applicable ACP. Refer to this guidance document 
for the number of days and geographic areas (i.e., operating 
environments) specified in Table 2 of this appendix.
    5.8  A facility owner or operator shall also identify, by contract 
or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, the availability of 
an oil spill removal organization(s) (as described in Sec. 112.2) 
capable of responding to a shoreline cleanup operation involving the 
calculated volume of oil and emulsified oil that might impact the 
affected shoreline. The volume of oil that shall, as appropriate, be 
planned for is calculated through the application of factors contained 
in Tables 2 and 3 of this appendix. The volume calculated from these 
tables is intended to assist the facility owner or operator to identify 
an oil spill removal organization with sufficient resources and 
expertise.

  6.0  Determining Effective Daily Recovery Capacity for Oil Recovery 
                                 Devices

    6.1  Oil recovery devices identified by a facility owner or operator 
must be identified by the manufacturer, model, and effective daily 
recovery capacity. These capacities must be used to determine whether 
there is sufficient capacity to meet the applicable planning criteria 
for a small discharge, a medium discharge, and a worst case discharge to 
the maximum extent practicable.
    6.2  To determine the effective daily recovery capacity of oil 
recovery devices, the formula listed in section 6.2.1 of this appendix 
shall be used. This formula considers potential limitations due to 
available daylight, weather, sea state, and percentage of emulsified oil 
in the recovered material. The RA may assign a lower efficiency factor 
to equipment listed in a response plan if it is determined that such a 
reduction is warranted.
    6.2.1  The following formula shall be used to calculate the 
effective daily recovery capacity:

R = T  x  24 hours  x  E

where:

R--Effective daily recovery capacity;
T--Throughput rate in barrels per hour (nameplate capacity); and

[[Page 329]]

E--20 percent efficiency factor (or lower factor as determined by the 
          Regional Administrator).

    6.2.2  For those devices in which the pump limits the throughput of 
liquid, throughput rate shall be calculated using the pump capacity.
    6.2.3  For belt or moptype devices, the throughput rate shall be 
calculated using the speed of the belt or mop through the device, 
assumed thickness of oil adhering to or collected by the device, and 
surface area of the belt or mop. For purposes of this calculation, the 
assumed thickness of oil will be \1/4\ inch.
    6.2.4  Facility owners or operators that include oil recovery 
devices whose throughput is not measurable using a pump capacity or 
belt/mop speed may provide information to support an alternative method 
of calculation. This information must be submitted following the 
procedures in section 6.3.2 of this appendix.
    6.3  As an alternative to section 6.2 of this appendix, a facility 
owner or operator may submit adequate evidence that a different 
effective daily recovery capacity should be applied for a specific oil 
recovery device. Adequate evidence is actual verified performance data 
in spill conditions or tests using American Society of Testing and 
Materials (ASTM) Standard F 631-80, F 808-83 (1988), or an equivalent 
test approved by EPA as deemed appropriate (see Appendix E to this part, 
section 10, for general availability of documents).
    6.3.1  The following formula must be used to calculate the effective 
daily recovery capacity under this alternative:

R = D  x  U

where:

R--Effective daily recovery capacity;
D--Average Oil Recovery Rate in barrels per hour (Item 26 in F 808-83; 
          Item 13.1.15 in F 631-80; or actual performance data); and
U--Hours per day that equipment can operate under spill conditions. Ten 
          hours per day must be used unless a facility owner or operator 
          can demonstrate that the recovery operation can be sustained 
          for longer periods.

    6.3.2  A facility owner or operator submitting a response plan shall 
provide data that supports the effective daily recovery capacities for 
the oil recovery devices listed. The following is an example of these 
calculations:
    (1) A weir skimmer identified in a response plan has a 
manufacturer's rated throughput at the pump of 267 gallons per minute 
(gpm).

267 gpm=381 barrels per hour (bph)
R=381 bph x 24 hr/day x 0.2=1,829 barrels per day

    (2) After testing using ASTM procedures, the skimmer's oil recovery 
rate is determined to be 220 gpm. The facility owner or operator 
identifies sufficient resources available to support operations for 12 
hours per day.

220 gpm=314 bph
R=314 bph x 12 hr/day=3,768 barrels per day

    (3) The facility owner or operator will be able to use the higher 
capacity if sufficient temporary oil storage capacity is available. 
Determination of alternative efficiency factors under section 6.2 of 
this appendix or the acceptability of an alternative effective daily 
recovery capacity under section 6.3 of this appendix will be made by the 
Regional Administrator as deemed appropriate.

      7.0  Calculating Planning Volumes for a Worst Case Discharge

    7.1  A facility owner or operator shall plan for a response to the 
facility's worst case discharge. The planning for on-water oil recovery 
must take into account a loss of some oil to the environment due to 
evaporative and natural dissipation, potential increases in volume due 
to emulsification, and the potential for deposition of oil on the 
shoreline. The procedures for non-petroleum oils are discussed in 
section 7.7 of this appendix.
    7.2  The following procedures must be used by a facility owner or 
operator in determining the required on-water oil recovery capacity:
    7.2.1  The following must be determined: the worst case discharge 
volume of oil in the facility; the appropriate group(s) for the types of 
oil handled, stored, or transported at the facility [persistent (Groups 
2, 3, 4, 5) or non-persistent (Group 1)]; and the facility's specific 
operating area. See sections 1.2.2 and 1.2.7 of this appendix for the 
definitions of non-persistent and persistent oils, respectively. 
Facilities that handle, store, or transport oil from different oil 
groups must calculate each group separately, unless the oil group 
constitutes 10 percent or less by volume of the facility's total oil 
storage capacity. This information is to be used with Table 2 of this 
appendix to determine the percentages of the total volume to be used for 
removal capacity planning. Table 2 of this appendix divides the volume 
into three categories: oil lost to the environment; oil deposited on the 
shoreline; and oil available for on-water recovery.
    7.2.2  The on-water oil recovery volume shall, as appropriate, be 
adjusted using the appropriate emulsification factor found in Table 3 of 
this appendix. Facilities that handle, store, or transport oil from 
different petroleum groups must compare the on-water recovery volume for 
each oil group (unless the oil group constitutes 10 percent or less by 
volume of the facility's total storage capacity) and use the calculation 
that results in the largest on-water oil recovery volume to plan for the 
amount of response resources for a worst case discharge.

[[Page 330]]

    7.2.3  The adjusted volume is multiplied by the on-water oil 
recovery resource mobilization factor found in Table 4 of this appendix 
from the appropriate operating area and response tier to determine the 
total on-water oil recovery capacity in barrels per day that must be 
identified or contracted to arrive on-scene within the applicable time 
for each response tier. Three tiers are specified. For higher volume 
port areas, the contracted tiers of resources must be located such that 
they are capable of arriving on-scene within 6 hours for Tier 1, 30 
hours for Tier 2, and 54 hours for Tier 3 of the discovery of an oil 
discharge. For all other rivers and canals, inland, nearshore areas, and 
the Great Lakes, these tiers are 12, 36, and 60 hours.
    7.2.4  The resulting on-water oil recovery capacity in barrels per 
day for each tier is used to identify response resources necessary to 
sustain operations in the applicable operating area. The equipment shall 
be capable of sustaining operations for the time period specified in 
Table 2 of this appendix. The facility owner or operator shall identify 
and ensure the availability, by contract or other approved means as 
described in Sec. 112.2, of sufficient oil spill recovery devices to 
provide the effective daily oil recovery capacity required. If the 
required capacity exceeds the applicable cap specified in Table 5 of 
this appendix, then a facility owner or operator shall ensure, by 
contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, only for 
the quantity of resources required to meet the cap, but shall identify 
sources of additional resources as indicated in section 5.4 of this 
appendix. The owner or operator of a facility whose planning volume 
exceeded the cap in 1993 must make arrangements to identify and ensure 
the availability, by contract or other approved means as described in 
Sec. 112.2, for additional capacity to be under contract by 1998 or 
2003, as appropriate. For a facility that handles multiple groups of 
oil, the required effective daily recovery capacity for each oil group 
is calculated before applying the cap. The oil group calculation 
resulting in the largest on-water recovery volume must be used to plan 
for the amount of response resources for a worst case discharge, unless 
the oil group comprises 10 percent or less by volume of the facility's 
total oil storage capacity.
    7.3  The procedures discussed in sections 7.3.1-7.3.3 of this 
appendix must be used to calculate the planning volume for identifying 
shoreline cleanup capacity (for Group 1 through Group 4 oils).
    7.3.1  The following must be determined: the worst case discharge 
volume of oil for the facility; the appropriate group(s) for the types 
of oil handled, stored, or transported at the facility [persistent 
(Groups 2, 3, or 4) or non-persistent (Group 1)]; and the geographic 
area(s) in which the facility operates (i.e., operating areas). For a 
facility handling, storing, or transporting oil from different groups, 
each group must be calculated separately. Using this information, Table 
2 of this appendix must be used to determine the percentages of the 
total volume to be used for shoreline cleanup resource planning.
    7.3.2  The shoreline cleanup planning volume must be adjusted to 
reflect an emulsification factor using the same procedure as described 
in section 7.2.2 of this appendix.
    7.3.3  The resulting volume shall be used to identify an oil spill 
removal organization with the appropriate shoreline cleanup capability.
    7.4  A response plan must identify response resources with fire 
fighting capability. The owner or operator of a facility that handles, 
stores, or transports Group 1 through Group 4 oils that does not have 
adequate fire fighting resources located at the facility or that cannot 
rely on sufficient local fire fighting resources must identify adequate 
fire fighting resources. It is recommended that the facility owner or 
operator ensure, by contract or other approved means as described in 
Sec. 112.2, the availability of these resources. The response plan must 
also identify an individual located at the facility to work with the 
fire department for Group 1 through Group 4 oil fires. This individual 
shall also verify that sufficient well-trained fire fighting resources 
are available within a reasonable response time to a worst case 
scenario. The individual may be the qualified individual identified in 
the response plan or another appropriate individual located at the 
facility.
    7.5  The following is an example of the procedure described above in 
sections 7.2 and 7.3 of this appendix: A facility with a 270,000 barrel 
(11.3 million gallons) capacity for #6 oil (specific gravity 0.96) is 
located in a higher volume port area. The facility is on a peninsula and 
has docks on both the ocean and bay sides. The facility has four 
aboveground oil storage tanks with a combined total capacity of 80,000 
barrels (3.36 million gallons) and no secondary containment. The 
remaining facility tanks are inside secondary containment structures. 
The largest aboveground oil storage tank (90,000 barrels or 3.78 million 
gallons) has its own secondary containment. Two 50,000 barrel (2.1 
million gallon) tanks (that are not connected by a manifold) are within 
a common secondary containment tank area, which is capable of holding 
100,000 barrels (4.2 million gallons) plus sufficient freeboard.
    7.5.1  The worst case discharge for the facility is calculated by 
adding the capacity of all aboveground oil storage tanks without 
secondary containment (80,000 barrels) plus the capacity of the largest 
aboveground oil storage tank inside secondary containment. The resulting 
worst case discharge volume is 170,000 barrels or 7.14 million gallons.

[[Page 331]]

    7.5.2  Because the requirements for Tiers 1, 2, and 3 for inland and 
nearshore exceed the caps identified in Table 5 of this appendix, the 
facility owner will contract for a response to 10,000 barrels per day 
(bpd) for Tier 1, 20,000 bpd for Tier 2, and 40,000 bpd for Tier 3. 
Resources for the remaining 7,850 bpd for Tier 1, 9,750 bpd for Tier 2, 
and 7,600 bpd for Tier 3 shall be identified but need not be contracted 
for in advance. The facility owner or operator shall, as appropriate, 
also identify or contract for quantities of boom identified in their 
response plan for the protection of fish and wildlife and sensitive 
environments within the area potentially impacted by a worst case 
discharge from the facility. For further description of fish and 
wildlife and sensitive environments, see Appendices I, II, and III to 
DOC/NOAA's ``Guidance for Facility and Vessel Response Plans: Fish and 
Wildlife and Sensitive Environments,'' (see Appendix E to this part, 
section 10, for availability) and the applicable ACP. Attachment C-III 
to Appendix C provides a method for calculating a planning distance to 
fish and wildlife and sensitive environments and public drinking water 
intakes that may be impacted in the event of a worst case discharge.
    7.6  The procedures discussed in sections 7.6.1--7.6.3 of this 
appendix must be used to determine appropriate response resources for 
facilities with Group 5 oils.
    7.6.1  The owner or operator of a facility that handles, stores, or 
transports Group 5 oils shall, as appropriate, identify the response 
resources available by contract or other approved means, as described in 
Sec. 112.2. The equipment identified in a response plan shall, as 
appropriate, include:
    (1) Sonar, sampling equipment, or other methods for locating the oil 
on the bottom or suspended in the water column;
    (2) Containment boom, sorbent boom, silt curtains, or other methods 
for containing the oil that may remain floating on the surface or to 
reduce spreading on the bottom;
    (3) Dredges, pumps, or other equipment necessary to recover oil from 
the bottom and shoreline;
    (4) Equipment necessary to assess the impact of such discharges; and
    (5) Other appropriate equipment necessary to respond to a discharge 
involving the type of oil handled, stored, or transported.
    7.6.2  Response resources identified in a response plan for a 
facility that handles, stores, or transports Group 5 oils under section 
7.6.1 of this appendix shall be capable of being deployed (on site) 
within 24 hours of discovery of a discharge to the area where the 
facility is operating.
    7.6.3  A response plan must identify response resources with fire 
fighting capability. The owner or operator of a facility that handles, 
stores, or transports Group 5 oils that does not have adequate fire 
fighting resources located at the facility or that cannot rely on 
sufficient local fire fighting resources must identify adequate fire 
fighting resources. It is recommended that the owner or operator ensure, 
by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, the 
availability of these resources. The response plan shall also identify 
an individual located at the facility to work with the fire department 
for Group 5 oil fires. This individual shall also verify that sufficient 
well-trained fire fighting resources are available within a reasonable 
response time to respond to a worst case discharge. The individual may 
be the qualified individual identified in the response plan or another 
appropriate individual located at the facility.
    7.7  The procedures described in sections 7.7.1-7.7.5 of this 
appendix must be used to determine appropriate response plan development 
and evaluation criteria for facilities that handle, store, or transport 
non-petroleum oils. Refer to section 8 of this appendix for information 
on the limitations on the use of dispersants for inland and nearshore 
areas.
    7.7.1  An owner or operator of a facility that handles, stores, or 
transports non-petroleum oil must provide information in his or her plan 
that identifies:
    (1) Procedures and strategies for responding to a worst case 
discharge of non-petroleum oils to the maximum extent practicable; and
    (2) Sources of the equipment and supplies necessary to locate, 
recover, and mitigate such a discharge.
    7.7.2  An owner or operator of a facility that handles, stores, or 
transports non-petroleum oil must ensure that any equipment identified 
in a response plan is capable of operating in the conditions expected in 
the geographic area(s) (i.e., operating environments) in which the 
facility operates using the criteria in Table 1 of this appendix. When 
evaluating the operability of equipment, the facility owner or operator 
must consider limitations that are identified in the appropriate ACPs, 
including:
    (1) Ice conditions;
    (2) Debris;
    (3) Temperature ranges; and
    (4) Weather-related visibility.
    7.7.3  The owner or operator of a facility that handles, stores, or 
transports non-petroleum oil must identify the response resources that 
are available by contract or other approved means, as described in 
Sec. 112.2. The equipment described in the response plan shall, as 
appropriate, include:
    (1) Containment boom, sorbent boom, or other methods for containing 
oil floating on the surface or to protect shorelines from impact;
    (2) Oil recovery devices appropriate for the type of non-petroleum 
oil carried; and

[[Page 332]]

    (3) Other appropriate equipment necessary to respond to a discharge 
involving the type of oil carried.
    7.7.4  Response resources identified in a response plan according to 
section 7.7.3 of this appendix must be capable of commencing an 
effective on-scene response within the applicable tier response times in 
section 5.3 of this appendix.
    7.7.5  A response plan must identify response resources with fire 
fighting capability. The owner or operator of a facility that handles, 
stores, or transports non-petroleum oils that does not have adequate 
fire fighting resources located at the facility or that cannot rely on 
sufficient local fire fighting resources must identify adequate fire 
fighting resources. It is recommended that the owner or operator ensure, 
by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, the 
availability of these resources. The response plan must also identify an 
individual located at the facility to work with the fire department for 
non-petroleum fires. This individual shall also verify that sufficient 
well-trained fire fighting resources are available within a reasonable 
response time to a worst case scenario. The individual may be the 
qualified individual identified in the response plan or another 
appropriate individual located at the facility.

    8.0  Determining the Availability of Alternative Response Methods

    8.1  For dispersants to be identified in a response plan, they must 
be on the NCP Product Schedule that is maintained by EPA. (Some States 
have a list of approved dispersants for use within State waters. These 
State-approved dispersants are listed on the NCP Product Schedule.)
    8.2  Identification of dispersant application in the plan does not 
imply that the use of this technique will be authorized. Actual 
authorization for use during a spill response will be governed by the 
provisions of the NCP and the applicable ACP. To date, dispersant 
application has not been approved by ACPs for inland areas or shallow 
nearshore areas.

   9.0  Additional Equipment Necessary to Sustain Response Operations

    9.1  A facility owner or operator shall, as appropriate, ensure that 
sufficient numbers of trained personnel and boats, aerial spotting 
aircraft, containment boom, sorbent materials, boom anchoring materials, 
and other supplies are available to sustain response operations to 
completion. All such equipment must be suitable for use with the primary 
equipment identified in the response plan. A facility owner or operator 
is not required to list these resources, but shall certify their 
availability.
    9.2  A facility owner or operator shall evaluate the availability of 
adequate temporary storage capacity to sustain the effective daily 
recovery capacities from equipment identified in the plan. Because of 
the inefficiencies of oil spill recovery devices, response plans must 
identify daily storage capacity equivalent to twice the effective daily 
recovery capacity required on-scene. This temporary storage capacity may 
be reduced if a facility owner or operator can demonstrate by waste 
stream analysis that the efficiencies of the oil recovery devices, 
ability to decant waste, or the availability of alternative temporary 
storage or disposal locations will reduce the overall volume of oily 
material storage requirement.
    9.3  A facility owner or operator shall ensure that his or her 
planning includes the capability to arrange for disposal of recovered 
oil products. Specific disposal procedures will be addressed in the 
applicable ACP.

                1.0 Model Facility-Specific Response Plan

    (A) Owners or operators of facilities regulated under this part 
which pose a threat of substantial harm to the environment by 
discharging oil into or on navigable waters or adjoining shorelines are 
required to prepare and submit facility-specific response plans to EPA 
in accordance with the provisions in this appendix. This appendix 
further describes the required elements in Sec. 112.20(h).
    (B) Response plans must be sent to the appropriate EPA Regional 
office. Figure F-1 of this Appendix lists each EPA Regional office and 
the address where owners or operators must submit their response plans. 
Those facilities deemed by the Regional Administrator (RA) to pose a 
threat of significant and substantial harm to the environment will have 
their plans reviewed and approved by EPA. In certain cases, information 
required in the model response plan is similar to information currently 
maintained in the facility's Spill Prevention, Control, and 
Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan as required by 40 CFR 112.3. In these cases, 
owners or operators may reproduce the information and include a 
photocopy in the response plan.
    (C) A complex may develop a single response plan with a set of core 
elements for all regulating agencies and separate sections for the non-
transportation-related and transportation-related components, as 
described in Sec. 112.20(h). Owners or operators of large facilities 
that handle, store, or transport oil at more than one geographically 
distinct location (e.g., oil storage areas at opposite ends of a single, 
continuous parcel of property) shall, as appropriate, develop separate 
sections of the response plan for each storage area.

                   1.1  Emergency Response Action Plan

    Several sections of the response plan shall be co-located for easy 
access by response personnel during an actual emergency or oil spill. 
This collection of sections shall be called the Emergency Response 
Action Plan. The Agency intends that the Action Plan contain only as 
much information as is necessary to combat the spill and be arranged so 
response actions are not delayed. The Action Plan may be arranged in a 
number of ways. For example, the sections of the Emergency Response 
Action Plan may be photocopies or condensed versions of the forms 
included in the associated sections of the response plan. Each Emergency 
Response Action Plan section may be tabbed for quick reference. The 
Action Plan shall be maintained in the front of the same binder that 
contains the complete response plan or it shall be contained in a 
separate binder. In the latter case, both binders shall be kept together 
so that the entire plan can be accessed by the qualified individual and 
appropriate spill response personnel. The Emergency Response Action Plan 
shall be made up of the following sections:

1. Qualified Individual Information (Section 1.2) partial
2. Emergency Notification Phone List (Section 1.3.1) partial
3. Spill Response Notification Form (Section 1.3.1) partial
4. Response Equipment List and Location (Section 1.3.2) complete
5. Response Equipment Testing and Deployment (Section 1.3.3) complete
6. Facility Response Team (Section 1.3.4) partial
7. Evacuation Plan (Section 1.3.5) condensed
8. Immediate Actions (Section 1.7.1) complete
9. Facility Diagram (Section 1.9) complete

                        1.2  Facility Information

    The facility information form is designed to provide an overview of 
the site and a description of past activities at the facility. Much of 
the information required by this section may be obtained from the 
facility's existing SPCC Plan.
    1.2.1  Facility name and location: Enter facility name and street 
address. Enter the address of corporate headquarters only if corporate 
headquarters are physically located at the facility. Include city, 
county, state, zip code, and phone number.
    1.2.2  Latitude and Longitude: Enter the latitude and longitude of 
the facility. Include degrees, minutes, and seconds of the main entrance 
of the facility.
    1.2.3  Wellhead Protection Area: Indicate if the facility is located 
in or drains into a wellhead protection area as defined by the Safe 
Drinking Water Act of 1986 (SDWA).\1\ The response plan requirements in 
the Wellhead Protection Program are outlined by the State or Territory 
in which the facility resides.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ A wellhead protection area is defined as the surface and 
subsurface area surrounding a water well or wellfield, supplying a 
public water system, through which contaminants are reasonably likely to 
move toward and reach such water well or wellfield. For further 
information regarding State and territory protection programs, facility 
owners or operators may contact the SDWA Hotline at 1-800-426-4791.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1.2.4  Owner/operator: Write the name of the company or person 
operating the facility and the name of the person or company that owns 
the facility, if the two are different. List the address of the owner, 
if the two are different.
    1.2.5  Qualified Individual: Write the name of the qualified 
individual for the entire facility. If more than one person is listed, 
each individual indicated in this section shall have full authority to 
implement the facility response plan. For each individual, list: name, 
position, home and work addresses (street addresses, not P.O. boxes), 
emergency phone number, and specific response training experience.
    1.2.6  Date of Oil Storage Start-up: Enter the year which the 
present facility first started storing oil.
    1.2.7  Current Operation: Briefly describe the facility's operations 
and include the Standard Industry Classification (SIC) code.
    1.2.8  Dates and Type of Substantial Expansion: Include information 
on expansions that have occurred at the facility. Examples of such 
expansions include, but are not limited to: Throughput expansion, 
addition of a product line, change of a product line, and installation 
of additional oil storage capacity. The data provided shall include all 
facility historical information and detail the expansion of the 
facility. An example of substantial expansion is any material alteration 
of the facility which causes the owner or operator of the facility to 
re-evaluate and increase the response equipment necessary to adequately 
respond to a worst case discharge from the facility.

                   1.3  Emergency Response Information

    (A) The information provided in this section shall describe what 
will be needed in an actual emergency involving the discharge of oil or 
a combination of hazardous substances and oil discharge. The Emergency 
Response Information section of the plan must include the following 
components:

    (1) The information provided in the Emergency Notification Phone 
List in section 1.3.1 identifies and prioritizes the names and phone 
numbers of the organizations and personnel that need to be notified 
immediately in the event of an emergency. This section shall include all 
the appropriate phone numbers for the facility. These numbers must be 
verified each time the plan is updated. The contact list must be 
accessible to all facility employees to ensure that, in case of a 
discharge, any employee on site could immediately notify the appropriate 
parties.
    (2) The Spill Response Notification Form in section 1.3.1 creates a 
checklist of information that shall be provided to the National Response 
Center (NRC) and other response personnel. All information on this 
checklist must be known at the time of notification, or be in the 
process of being collected. This notification form is based on a similar 
form used by the NRC. Note: Do not delay spill notification to collect 
the information on the list.
    (3) Section 1.3.2 provides a description of the facility's list of 
emergency response equipment and location of the response equipment. 
When appropriate, the amount of oil that emergency response equipment 
can handle and any limitations (e.g., launching sites) must be 
described.
    (4) Section 1.3.3 provides information regarding response equipment 
tests and deployment drills. Response equipment deployment exercises 
shall be conducted to ensure that response equipment is operational and 
the personnel who would operate the equipment in a spill response are 
capable of deploying and operating it. Only a representative sample of 
each type of response equipment needs to be deployed and operated, as 
long as the remainder is properly maintained. If appropriate, testing of 
response equipment may be conducted while it is being deployed. 
Facilities without facility-owned response equipment must ensure that 
the oil spill removal organization that is identified in the response 
plan to provide this response equipment certifies that the deployment 
exercises have been met. Refer to the National Preparedness for Response 
Exercise Program (PREP) Guidelines (see Appendix E to this part, section 
10, for availability), which satisfy Oil Pollution Act (OPA) response 
exercise requirements.
    (5) Section 1.3.4 lists the facility response personnel, including 
those employed by the facility and those under contract to the facility 
for response activities, the amount of time needed for personnel to 
respond, their responsibility in the case of an emergency, and their 
level of response training. Three different forms are included in this 
section. The Emergency Response Personnel List shall be composed of all 
personnel employed by the facility whose duties involve responding to 
emergencies, including oil spills, even when they are not physically 
present at the site. An example of this type of person would be the 
Building Engineer-in-Charge or Plant Fire Chief. The second form is a 
list of the Emergency Response Contractors (both primary and secondary) 
retained by the facility. Any changes in contractor status must be 
reflected in updates to the response plan. Evidence of contracts with 
response contractors shall be included in this section so that the 
availability of resources can be verified. The last form is the Facility 
Response Team List, which shall be composed of both emergency response 
personnel (referenced by job title/position) and emergency response 
contractors, included in one of the two lists described above, that will 
respond immediately upon discovery of an oil spill or other emergency 
(i.e., the first people to respond). These are to be persons normally on 
the facility premises or primary response contractors. Examples of these 
personnel would be the Facility Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Spill Team 
1, Facility Fire Engine Company 1, Production Supervisor, or Transfer 
Supervisor. Company personnel must be able to respond immediately and 
adequately if contractor support is not available.
    (6) Section 1.3.5 lists factors that must, as appropriate, be 
considered when preparing an evacuation plan.
    (7) Section 1.3.6 references the responsibilities of the qualified 
individual for the facility in the event of an emergency.

[[Page 343]]

    (B) The information provided in the emergency response section will 
aid in the assessment of the facility's ability to respond to a worst 
case discharge and will identify additional assistance that may be 
needed. In addition, the facility owner or operator may want to produce 
a wallet-size card containing a checklist of the immediate response and 
notification steps to be taken in the event of an oil discharge.

                         1.3.5  Evacuation Plans

    1.3.5.1  Based on the analysis of the facility, as discussed 
elsewhere in the plan, a facility-wide evacuation plan shall be 
developed. In addition, plans to evacuate parts of the facility that are 
at a high risk of exposure in the event of a spill or other release must 
be developed. Evacuation routes must be shown on a diagram of the 
facility (see section 1.9 of this appendix). When developing evacuation 
plans, consideration must be given to the following factors, as 
appropriate:
    (1) Location of stored materials;
    (2) Hazard imposed by spilled material;
    (3) Spill flow direction;
    (4) Prevailing wind direction and speed;
    (5) Water currents, tides, or wave conditions (if applicable);
    (6) Arrival route of emergency response personnel and response 
equipment;
    (7) Evacuation routes;
    (8) Alternative routes of evacuation;
    (9) Transportation of injured personnel to nearest emergency medical 
facility;
    (10) Location of alarm/notification systems;
    (11) The need for a centralized check-in area for evacuation 
validation (roll call);
    (12) Selection of a mitigation command center; and
    (13) Location of shelter at the facility as an alternative to 
evacuation.
    1.3.5.2  One resource that may be helpful to owners or operators in 
preparing this section of the response plan is The Handbook of Chemical 
Hazard Analysis Procedures by the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA), Department of Transportation (DOT), and EPA. The Handbook of 
Chemical Hazard Analysis Procedures is available from: FEMA , 
Publication Office, 500 C. Street, S.W., Washington, DC 20472, (202) 
646-3484.
    1.3.5.3  As specified in Sec. 112.20(h)(1)(vi), the facility owner 
or operator must reference existing community evacuation plans, as 
appropriate.

                  1.3.6  Qualified Individual's Duties

    The duties of the designated qualified individual are specified in 
Sec. 112.20(h)(3)(ix). The qualified individual's duties must be 
described and be consistent with the minimum requirements in 
Sec. 112.20(h)(3)(ix). In addition, the qualified individual must be 
identified with the Facility Information in section 1.2 of the response 
plan.

                         1.4  Hazard Evaluation

    This section requires the facility owner or operator to examine the 
facility's operations closely and to predict where discharges could 
occur. Hazard evaluation is a widely used industry practice that allows 
facility owners or operators to develop a complete understanding of 
potential hazards and the response actions necessary to address these 
hazards. The Handbook of Chemical Hazard Analysis Procedures, prepared 
by the EPA, DOT, and the FEMA and the Hazardous Materials Emergency 
Planning Guide (NRT-1), prepared by the National Response Team are good 
references for conducting a hazard analysis. Hazard identification and 
evaluation will assist facility owners or operators in planning for 
potential discharges, thereby reducing the severity of discharge impacts 
that may occur in the future. The evaluation also may help the operator 
identify and correct potential sources of discharges. In addition, 
special hazards to workers and emergency response personnel's health and 
safety shall be evaluated, as well as the facility's oil spill history.

                      1.4.1  Hazard  Identification

    The Tank and Surface Impoundment (SI) forms, or their equivalent, 
that are part of this section must be completed according to the 
directions below. (``Surface Impoundment'' means a facility or part of a 
facility which is a natural topographic depression, man-made excavation, 
or diked area formed primarily of earthen materials (although it may be 
lined with man-made materials), which is designed to hold an 
accumulation of liquid wastes or wastes containing free liquids, and 
which is not an injection well or a seepage facility.) Similar 
worksheets, or their equivalent, must be developed for any other type of 
storage containers.
    (1) List each tank at the facility with a separate and distinct 
identifier. Begin aboveground tank identifiers with an ``A'' and 
belowground tank identifiers with a ``B'', or submit multiple sheets 
with the aboveground tanks and belowground tanks on separate sheets.
    (2) Use gallons for the maximum capacity of a tank; and use square 
feet for the area.
    (3) Using the appropriate identifiers and the following 
instructions, fill in the appropriate forms:
    (a) Tank or SI number--Using the aforementioned identifiers (A or B) 
or multiple reporting sheets, identify each tank or SI at the facility 
that stores oil or hazardous materials.
    (b) Substance Stored--For each tank or SI identified, record the 
material that is stored therein. If the tank or SI is used to store more 
than one material, list all of the stored materials.
    (c) Quantity Stored--For each material stored in each tank or SI, 
report the average volume of material stored on any given day.
    (d) Tank Type or Surface Area/Year--For each tank, report the type 
of tank (e.g., floating top), and the year the tank was originally 
installed. If the tank has been refabricated, the year that the latest 
refabrication was completed must be recorded in parentheses next to the 
year installed. For

[[Page 350]]

each SI, record the surface area of the impoundment and the year it went 
into service.
    (e) Maximum Capacity--Record the operational maximum capacity for 
each tank and SI. If the maximum capacity varies with the season, record 
the upper and lower limits.
    (f) Failure/Cause--Record the cause and date of any tank or SI 
failure which has resulted in a loss of tank or SI contents.
    (4) Using the numbers from the tank and SI forms, label a schematic 
drawing of the facility. This drawing shall be identical to any 
schematic drawings included in the SPCC Plan.
    (5) Using knowledge of the facility and its operations, describe the 
following in writing:
    (a) The loading and unloading of transportation vehicles that risk 
the discharge of oil or release of hazardous substances during transport 
processes. These operations may include loading and unloading of trucks, 
railroad cars, or vessels. Estimate the volume of material involved in 
transfer operations, if the exact volume cannot be determined.
    (b) Day-to-day operations that may present a risk of discharging oil 
or releasing a hazardous substance. These activities include scheduled 
venting, piping repair or replacement, valve maintenance, transfer of 
tank contents from one tank to another, etc. (not including 
transportation-related activities). Estimate the volume of material 
involved in these operations, if the exact volume cannot be determined.
    (c) The secondary containment volume associated with each tank and/
or transfer point at the facility. The numbering scheme developed on the 
tables, or an equivalent system, must be used to identify each 
containment area. Capacities must be listed for each individual unit 
(tanks, slumps, drainage traps, and ponds), as well as the facility 
total.
    (d) Normal daily throughput for the facility and any effect on 
potential discharge volumes that a negative or positive change in that 
throughput may cause.

                      1.4.2  Vulnerability Analysis

    The vulnerability analysis shall address the potential effects 
(i.e., to human health, property, or the environment) of an oil spill. 
Attachment C-III to Appendix C to this part provides a method that 
owners or operators shall use to determine appropriate distances from 
the facility to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments. Owners or 
operators can use a comparable formula that is considered acceptable by 
the RA. If a comparable formula is used, documentation of the 
reliability and analytical soundness of the formula must be attached to 
the response plan cover sheet. This analysis must be prepared for each 
facility and, as appropriate, must discuss the vulnerability of:
    (1) Water intakes (drinking, cooling, or other);
    (2) Schools;
    (3) Medical facilities;
    (4) Residential areas;
    (5) Businesses;
    (6) Wetlands or other sensitive environments; \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Refer to the DOC/NOAA ``Guidance for Facility and Vessel 
Response Plans: Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments'' (See 
appendix E to this part, section 10, for availability).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (7) Fish and wildlife;
    (8) Lakes and streams;
    (9) Endangered flora and fauna;
    (10) Recreational areas;
    (11) Transportation routes (air, land, and water);
    (12) Utilities; and
    (13) Other areas of economic importance (e.g., beaches, marinas) 
including terrestrially sensitive environments, aquatic environments, 
and unique habitats.

            1.4.3  Analysis of the Potential for an Oil Spill

    Each owner or operator shall analyze the probability of a spill 
occurring at the facility. This analysis shall incorporate factors such 
as oil spill history, horizontal range of a potential spill, and 
vulnerability to natural disaster, and shall, as appropriate, 
incorporate other factors such as tank age. This analysis will provide 
information for developing discharge scenarios for a worst case 
discharge and small and medium discharges and aid in the development of 
techniques to reduce the size and frequency of spills. The owner or 
operator may need to research the age of the tanks and the oil spill 
history at the facility.

              1.4.4  Facility Reportable Oil Spill History

    Briefly describe the facility's reportable oil spill \3\ history for 
the entire life of the facility to the extent that such information is 
reasonably identifiable, including:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ As described in 40 CFR part 110, reportable oil spills are those 
that: (a) violate applicable water quality standards, or (b) cause a 
film or sheen upon or discoloration of the surface of the water or 
adjoining shorelines or cause a sludge or emulsion to be deposited 
beneath the surface of the water or upon adjoining shorelines.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Date of discharge(s);
    (2) List of discharge causes;
    (3) Material(s) discharged;
    (4) Amount discharged in gallons;
    (5) Amount of discharge that reached navigable waters, if 
applicable;
    (6) Effectiveness and capacity of secondary containment;
    (7) Clean-up actions taken;
    (8) Steps taken to reduce possibility of recurrence;
    (9) Total oil storage capacity of the tank(s) or impoundment(s) from 
which the material discharged;
    (10) Enforcement actions;
    (11) Effectiveness of monitoring equipment; and

[[Page 352]]

    (12) Description(s) of how each oil spill was detected.

The information solicited in this section may be similar to requirements 
in 40 CFR 112.4(a). Any duplicate information required by Sec. 112.4(a) 
may be photocopied and inserted.

                        1.5  Discharge Scenarios

    In this section, the owner or operator is required to provide a 
description of the facility's worst case discharge, as well as a small 
and medium spill, as appropriate. A multi-level planning approach has 
been chosen because the response actions to a spill (i.e., necessary 
response equipment, products, and personnel) are dependent on the 
magnitude of the spill. Planning for lesser discharges is necessary 
because the nature of the response may be qualitatively different 
depending on the quantity of the discharge. The facility owner or 
operator shall discuss the potential direction of the spill pathway.

                   1.5.1  Small and Medium Discharges

    1.5.1.1  To address multi-level planning requirements, the owner or 
operator must consider types of facility-specific spill scenarios that 
may contribute to a small or medium spill. The scenarios shall account 
for all the operations that take place at the facility, including but 
not limited to:
    (1) Loading and unloading of surface transportation;
    (2) Facility maintenance;
    (3) Facility piping;
    (4) Pumping stations and sumps;
    (5) Oil storage tanks;
    (6) Vehicle refueling; and
    (7) Age and condition of facility and components.
    1.5.1.2  The scenarios shall also consider factors that affect the 
response efforts required by the facility. These include but are not 
limited to:
    (1) Size of the spill;
    (2) Proximity to downgradient wells, waterways, and drinking water 
intakes;
    (3) Proximity to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments;
    (4) Likelihood that the discharge will travel offsite (i.e., 
topography, drainage) ;
    (5) Location of the material spilled (i.e., on a concrete pad or 
directly on the soil);
    (6) Material discharged;
    (7) Weather or aquatic conditions (i.e., river flow);
    (8) Available remediation equipment;
    (9) Probability of a chain reaction of failures; and
    (10) Direction of spill pathway.

                       1.5.2  Worst Case Discharge

    1.5.2.1  In this section, the owner or operator must identify the 
worst case discharge volume at the facility. Worksheets for production 
and non-production facility owners or operators to use when calculating 
worst case discharge are presented in Appendix D to this part. When 
planning for the worst case discharge response, all of the 
aforementioned factors listed in the small and medium discharge section 
of the response plan shall be addressed.
    1.5.2.2  For onshore storage facilities and production facilities, 
permanently manifolded oil storage tanks are defined as tanks that are 
designed, installed, and/or operated in such a manner that the multiple 
tanks function as one storage unit (i.e., multiple tank volumes are 
equalized). In this section of the response plan, owners or operators 
must provide evidence that oil storage tanks with common piping or 
piping systems are not operated as one unit. If such evidence is 
provided and is acceptable to the RA, the worst case discharge volume 
shall be based on the combined oil storage capacity of all manifold 
tanks or the oil storage capacity of the largest single oil storage tank 
within the secondary containment area, whichever is greater. For 
permanently manifolded oil storage tanks that function as one storage 
unit, the worst case discharge shall be based on the combined oil 
storage capacity of all manifolded tanks or the oil storage capacity of 
the largest single tank within a secondary containment area, whichever 
is greater. For purposes of the worst case discharge calculation, 
permanently manifolded oil storage tanks that are separated by internal 
divisions for each tank are considered to be single tanks and individual 
manifolded tank volumes are not combined.

                    1.6  Discharge Detection Systems

    In this section, the facility owner or operator shall provide a 
detailed description of the procedures and equipment used to detect 
discharges. A section on spill detection by personnel and a discussion 
of automated spill detection, if applicable, shall be included for both 
regular operations and after hours operations. In addition, the facility 
owner or operator shall discuss how the reliability of any automated 
system will be checked and how frequently the system will be inspected.

                 1.6.1  Discharge Detection by Personnel

    In this section, facility owners or operators shall describe the 
procedures and personnel that will detect any spill or uncontrolled 
discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance. A thorough 
discussion of facility inspections must be included. In addition, a 
description of initial response actions shall be addressed. This section 
shall reference section 1.3.1 of the response plan for emergency 
response information.

[[Page 353]]

                  1.6.2  Automated Discharge Detection

    In this section, facility owners or operators must describe any 
automated spill detection equipment that the facility has in place. This 
section shall include a discussion of overfill alarms, secondary 
containment sensors, etc. A discussion of the plans to verify an 
automated alarm and the actions to be taken once verified must also be 
included.

                        1.7  Plan Implementation

    In this section, facility owners or operators must explain in detail 
how to implement the facility's emergency response plan by describing 
response actions to be carried out under the plan to ensure the safety 
of the facility and to mitigate or prevent discharges described in 
section 1.5 of the response plan. This section shall include the 
identification of response resources for small, medium, and worst case 
spills; disposal plans; and containment and drainage planning. A list of 
those personnel who would be involved in the cleanup shall be 
identified. Procedures that the facility will use, where appropriate or 
necessary, to update their plan after an oil spill event and the time 
frame to update the plan must be described.

   1.7.1  Response Resources for Small, Medium, and Worst Case Spills

    1.7.1.1  Once the spill scenarios have been identified in section 
1.5 of the response plan, the facility owner or operator shall identify 
and describe implementation of the response actions. The facility owner 
or operator shall demonstrate accessibility to the proper response 
personnel and equipment to effectively respond to all of the identified 
spill scenarios. The determination and demonstration of adequate 
response capability are presented in Appendix E to this part. In 
addition, steps to expedite the cleanup of oil spills must be discussed. 
At a minimum, the following items must be addressed:
    (1) Emergency plans for spill response;
    (2) Additional response training;
    (3) Additional contracted help;
    (4) Access to additional response equipment/experts; and
    (5) Ability to implement the plan including response training and 
practice drills.

                          1.7.2  Disposal Plans

    1.7.2.1  Facility owners or operators must describe how and where 
the facility intends to recover, reuse, decontaminate, or dispose of 
materials after a discharge has taken place. The appropriate permits 
required to transport or dispose of recovered materials according to 
local, State, and Federal requirements must be addressed. Materials that 
must be accounted for in the disposal plan, as appropriate, include:
    (1) Recovered product;
    (2) Contaminated soil;
    (3) Contaminated equipment and materials, including drums, tank 
parts, valves, and shovels;
    (4) Personnel protective equipment;
    (5) Decontamination solutions;
    (6) Adsorbents; and
    (7) Spent chemicals.
    1.7.2.2  These plans must be prepared in accordance with Federal 
(e.g., the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act [RCRA]), State, and 
local regulations, where applicable. A copy of the disposal plans from 
the facility's SPCC Plan may be inserted with this section, including 
any diagrams in those plans.

                1.7.3  Containment and Drainage Planning

    A proper plan to contain and control a spill through drainage may 
limit the threat of harm to human health and the environment. This 
section shall describe how to contain and control a spill through 
drainage, including:
    (1) The available volume of containment (use the information 
presented in section 1.4.1 of the response plan);
    (2) The route of drainage from oil storage and transfer areas;

[[Page 354]]

    (3) The construction materials used in drainage troughs;
    (4) The type and number of valves and separators used in the 
drainage system;
    (5) Sump pump capacities;
    (6) The containment capacity of weirs and booms that might be used 
and their location (see section 1.3.2 of this appendix); and
    (7) Other cleanup materials.

In addition, facility owners or operators must meet the inspection and 
monitoring requirements for drainage contained in 40 CFR 112.7(e). A 
copy of the containment and drainage plans that are required in 40 CFR 
112.7(e) may be inserted in this section, including any diagrams in 
those plans.

    Note: The general permit for stormwater drainage may contain 
additional requirements.

      1.8  Self-Inspection, Drills/Exercises, and Response Training

    The owner or operator must develop programs for facility response 
training and for drills/exercises according to the requirements of 40 
CFR 112.21. Logs must be kept for facility drills/exercises, personnel 
response training, and spill prevention meetings. Much of the 
recordkeeping information required by this section is also contained in 
the SPCC Plan required by 40 CFR 112.3. These logs may be included in 
the facility response plan or kept as an annex to the facility response 
plan.

                     1.8.1  Facility Self-Inspection

    Pursuant to 40 CFR 112.7(e)(8), each facility shall include the 
written procedures and records of inspections in the SPCC Plan. The 
inspection shall include the tanks, secondary containment, and response 
equipment at the facility. Records of the inspections of tanks and 
secondary containment required by 40 CFR 112.7(e) shall be cross-
referenced in the response plan. The inspection of response equipment is 
a new requirement in this plan. Facility self-inspection requires two 
steps: (1) a checklist of things to inspect; and (2) a method of 
recording the actual inspection and its findings. The date of each 
inspection shall be noted. These records are required to be maintained 
for 5 years.

                        1.8.1.1  Tank Inspection

    The tank inspection checklist presented below has been included as 
guidance during inspections and monitoring. Similar requirements exist 
in 40 CFR 112.7(e). Duplicate information from the SPCC Plan may be 
photocopied and inserted in this section. The inspection checklist 
consists of the following items:

                        Tank Inspection Checklist

1. Check tanks for leaks, specifically looking for:
    A. drip marks;
    B. discoloration of tanks;
    C. puddles containing spilled or leaked material;
    D. corrosion;
    E. cracks; and
    F. localized dead vegetation.
2. Check foundation for:
    A. cracks;
    B. discoloration;
    C. puddles containing spilled or leaked material;
    D. settling;
    E. gaps between tank and foundation; and
    F. damage caused by vegetation roots.
3. Check piping for:
    A. droplets of stored material;
    B. discoloration;
    C. corrosion;
    D. bowing of pipe between supports;
    E. evidence of stored material seepage from valves or seals; and
    F. localized dead vegetation.

and 1.7.2 of the response plan), checking the following:

                     Secondary Containment Checklist

1. Dike or berm system.
    A. Level of precipitation in dike/available capacity;
    B. Operational status of drainage valves;
    C. Dike or berm permeability;
    D. Debris;
    E. Erosion;
    F. Permeability of the earthen floor of diked area; and
    G. Location/status of pipes, inlets, drainage beneath tanks, etc.
2. Secondary containment
    A. Cracks;
    B. Discoloration;
    C. Presence of spilled or leaked material (standing liquid);
    D. Corrosion; and
    E. Valve conditions.
3. Retention and drainage ponds
    A. Erosion;
    B. Available capacity;
    C. Presence of spilled or leaked material;
    D. Debris; and
    E. Stressed vegetation.

During inspection, make note of discrepancies in any of the above 
mentioned items, and report them immediately to the proper facility 
personnel. Similar requirements exist in 40 CFR 112.7(e). Duplicate 
information from the SPCC Plan may be photocopied and inserted in this 
section.

                    1.8.2  Facility Drills/Exercises

    (A) CWA section 311(j)(5), as amended by OPA, requires the response 
plan to contain a description of facility drills/exercises. According to 
40 CFR 112.21(c), the facility owner or operator shall develop a program 
of facility response drills/exercises, including evaluation procedures. 
Following the PREP guidelines (see Appendix E to this part, section 10, 
for availability) would satisfy a facility's requirements for drills/
exercises under this part. Alternately, under Sec. 112.21(c), a facility 
owner or operator may develop a program that is not based on the PREP 
guidelines. Such a program is subject to approval by the Regional 
Administrator based on the description of the program provided in the 
response plan.
    (B) The PREP Guidelines specify that the facility conduct internal 
and external drills/exercises. The internal exercises include: qualified 
individual notification drills, spill management team tabletop 
exercises, equipment deployment exercises, and unannounced exercises. 
External exercises include Area Exercises. Credit for an Area or 
Facility-specific Exercise will be given to the facility for an actual 
response to a spill in the area if the plan was utilized for response to 
the spill and the objectives of the Exercise were met and were properly 
evaluated, documented and self-certified.
    (C) Section 112.20(h)(8)(ii) requires the facility owner or operator 
to provide a description of the drill/exercise program to be carried out 
under the response plan. Qualified Individual Notification Drill and 
Spill Management Team Tabletop Drill logs shall be provided in sections 
1.8.2.1 and 1.8.2.2, respectively. These logs may be included in the 
facility response plan or kept as an annex to the facility response 
plan. See section 1.3.3 of this appendix for Equipment Deployment Drill 
Logs.

                        1.8.3  Response Training

    Section 112.21(a) requires facility owners or operators to develop 
programs for facility response training. Facility owners or operators 
are required by Sec. 112.20(h)(8)(iii) to provide a description of the 
response training program to be carried out under the response plan. A 
facility's training program can be based on the USCG's Training Elements 
for Oil Spill Response, to the extent applicable to facility operations, 
or another response training program acceptable to the RA. The training 
elements are available from Petty Officer Daniel Caras at (202) 267-6570 
or fax 267-4085/4065. Personnel response training logs and discharge 
prevention meeting logs shall be included in sections 1.8.3.1 and 
1.8.3.2 of the response plan respectively. These logs may be included in 
the facility response plan or kept as an annex to the facility response 
plan.

                              1.9  Diagrams

    The facility-specific response plan shall include the following 
diagrams. Additional diagrams that would aid in the development of 
response plan sections may also be included.

(1) The Site Plan Diagram shall, as appropriate, include and identify:
    (A) the entire facility to scale;
    (B) above and below ground bulk oil storage tanks;
    (C) the contents and capacities of bulk oil storage tanks;
    (D) the contents and capacity of drum oil storage areas;
    (E) the contents and capacities of surface impoundments;
    (F) process buildings;
    (G) transfer areas;
    (H) secondary containment systems (location and capacity);
    (I) structures where hazardous materials are stored or handled,

regulated by other Agencies. In most cases, this interface is defined as 
the last valve inside secondary containment before piping leaves the 
secondary containment area to connect to the transportation-related 
portion of the facility (i.e., the structure used or intended to be used 
to transfer oil to or from a vessel or pipeline). In the absence of 
secondary containment, this interface is the valve manifold adjacent to 
the tank nearest the transfer structure as described above. The 
interface may be defined differently at a specific facility if agreed to 
by the RA and the appropriate Federal official.
(2) The Site Drainage Plan Diagram shall, as appropriate, include:
    (A) major sanitary and storm sewers, manholes, and drains;
    (B) weirs and shut-off valves;
    (C) surface water receiving streams;
    (D) fire fighting water sources;
    (E) other utilities;
    (F) response personnel ingress and egress;
    (G) response equipment transportation routes; and
    (H) direction of spill flow from discharge points.

through (5) of this section (``Wetlands'' means those areas that are 
inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and 
duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do 
support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in 
saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally included playa lakes, 
swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas such as sloughs, prairie 
potholes, wet meadows, prairie river overflows, mudflats, and natural 
ponds): Provided, That waste treatment systems (other than cooling ponds 
meeting the criteria of this paragraph) are not waters of the United 
States.

Navigable waters do not include prior converted cropland. 
Notwithstanding the determination of an area's status as prior converted 
cropland by any other federal agency, for the purposes of the Clean 
Water Act, the final authority regarding Clean Water Act jurisdiction 
remains with EPA.

    (j) Process waste water means any water which, during manufacturing 
or processing, comes into direct contact with or results from the 
production or use of any raw material, intermediate product, finished 
product, byproduct, or waste product.

such permit;
    (3) Continuous or anticipated intermittent discharges from a point 
source, identified in a permit or permit application under section 402 
of this Act, which are caused by events occurring within the scope of 
the relevant operating or treatment systems; or
    (b) A discharge is ``in compliance with a permit issued under 
section 402 of this Act'' if the permit contains an effluent limitation 
specifically applicable to the substance discharged or an effluent 
limitation applicable to another waste parameter which has been 
specifically identified in the permit as intended to limit such 
substance, and the discharge is in compliance with the effluent 
limitation.
    (c) A discharge results ``from circumstances identified, reviewed 
and made a part of the public record with respect to a permit issued or 
modified under section 402 of the Act, and subject to a condition in 
such permit,'' whether or not the discharge is in compliance with the 
permit, where:

the event of an on-site release; and
    (3) The treatment to be provided is in place.
    (d) A discharge is a ``continuous or anticipated intermittent 
discharge from a point source, identified in a permit or permit 
application under section 402 of this Act, and caused by events 
occurring within the scope of the relevant operating or treatment 
systems,'' whether or not the discharge is in compliance with the 
permit, if:
    (1) The hazardous substance is discharged from a point source for 
which a valid permit exists or for which a permit application has been 
submitted; and
    (2) The discharge of the hazardous substance results from:
    (i) The contamination of noncontact cooling water or storm water, 
provided that such cooling water or storm water is not contaminated by 
an on-site spill of a hazardous substance; or
    (ii) A continuous or anticipated intermittent discharge of process 
waste water, and the discharge originates within the manufacturing or 
treatment systems; or
    (iii) An upset or failure of a treatment system or of a process

    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) These regulations apply to all discharges of reportable 
quantities to a POTW, where the discharge originates from a mobile 
source, except where such source has contracted with, or otherwise 
received written permission from the owners or operators of the POTW to 
discharge that quantity, and the mobile source can show that prior to 
accepting the substance from an industrial discharger, the substance had 
been treated to comply with any effluent limitation under sections 301, 
302 or 306 or pretreatment standard under section 307 applicable to that 
facility.


<R05>
Sec. 117.14  Demonstration projects.

    In any case where a substance designated as hazardous in 40 CFR part 
116 is discharged from any vessel or onshore or offshore facility in a 
quantity equal to or exceeding the reportable quantity determined by 
this part, the owner, operator or person in charge will be liable, 
pursuant to section 311 (f) and (g) of the Act, to the United States 
Government for the actual costs incurred in the removal of such 
substance, subject only to the defenses and monetary limitations 
enumerated in section 311 (f) and (g) of the Act.

The Administrator may act to mitigate the damage to the public health or 
welfare caused by a discharge and the cost of such mitigation shall be 
considered a cost incurred under section 311(c) for the removal of that 
substance by the United States Government.

parties shall be provided an opportunity to comment on such request in 
such manner as the Regional Administrator deems appropriate. All 
interested and affected parties will be given reasonable opportunity to 
present evidence and testimony at a public hearing on the question 
whether to grant or deny certification if the Regional Administrator 
determines that such a hearing is necessary or appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 121.24   Certification.

    If, after considering the complete description, the record of a 
hearing, if any, held pursuant to Sec. 121.23, and such other 
information and data as the Regional Administrator deems relevant, the 
Regional Administrator determines that there is reasonable assurance 
that the proposed activity will not result in a violation of applicable 
water quality standards, he shall so certify. If the Regional 
Administrator determines that no water quality standards are applicable 
to the waters which might be affected by the proposed activity, he shall 
so notify the applicant and the licensing or permitting agency in 
writing and shall provide the licensing or permitting agency with 
advice, suggestions, and recommendations with respect to conditions to 
be incorporated in any license or permit to achieve compliance with the 
purpose of this Act. In such case, no certification shall be required.


<R05>
Sec. 121.25   Adoption of new water quality standards.

    (a) In any case where:
    (1) A license or permit was issued without certification due to the 
absence of applicable water quality standards; and
    (2) Water quality standards applicable to the waters into which the 
licensed or permitted activity may discharge are subsequently 
established; and
    (3) The Administrator is the certifying agency because:
    (i) No State or interstate agency has authority to certify; or
    (ii) Such new standards were promulgated by the Administrator 
pursuant to section 10(c)(2) of the Act; and
    (4) The Regional Administrator determines that such uncertified 
activity is violating water quality standards;

Then the Regional Administrator shall notify the licensee or permittee 
of such violation, including his recommendations as to actions necessary 
for compliance. If the licensee or permittee fails within 6 months of 
the date of such notice to take action which in the opinion of the 
Regional Administrator will result in compliance with applicable water 
quality standards, the Regional Administrator shall notify the licensing 
or permitting agency that the licensee or permittee has failed, after 
reasonable notice, to comply with such standards and that suspension of 
the applicable license or permit is required by section 21(b)(9)(B) of 
the Act.
    (b) Where a license or permit is suspended pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this section, and where the licensee or permittee subsequently takes 
action which in the Regional Administrator's opinion will result in 
compliance with applicable water quality standards, the Regional 
Administrator shall then notify the licensing or permitting agency that 
there is reasonable assurance that the licensed or permitted activity 
will comply with applicable water quality standards.

[[Page 385]]


<R05>
Sec. 121.26   Inspection of facility or activity before operation.

    Where any facility or activity has received certification pursuant 
to Sec. 121.24 in connection with the issuance of a license or permit 
for construction, and where such facility or activity is not required to 
obtain an operating license or permit, the Regional Administrator or his 
representative, prior to the initial operation of such facility or 
activity, shall be afforded the opportunity to inspect such facility or 
activity for the purpose of determining if the manner in which such 
facility or activity will be operated or conducted will violate 
applicable water quality standards.


<R05>
Sec. 121.27   Notification to licensing or permitting agency.

    If the Regional Administrator, after an inspection pursuant to 
Sec. 121.26, determines that operation of the proposed facility or 
activity will violate applicable water quality standards, he shall so 
notify the applicant and the licensing or permitting agency, including 
his recommendations as to remedial measures necessary to bring the 
operation of the proposed facility into compliance with such standards.


<R05>
Sec. 121.28   Termination of suspension.

    Where a licensing or permitting agency, following a public hearing, 
suspends a license or permit after receiving the Regional 
Administrator's notice and recommendation pursuant to Sec. 121.27, the 
applicant may submit evidence to the Regional Administrator that the 
facility or activity or the operation or conduct thereof has been 
modified so as not to violate water quality standards. If the Regional 
Administrator determines that water quality standards will not be 
violated, he shall so notify the licensing or permitting agency.


<R04>
                        Subpart D--Consultations


<R05>
Sec. 121.30   Review and advice.

    The Regional Administrator may, and upon request shall, provide 
licensing and permitting agencies with determinations, definitions and 
interpretations with respect to the meaning and content of water quality 
standards where they have been federally approved under section 10 of 
the Act, and findings with respect to the application of all applicable 
water quality standards in particular cases and in specific 
circumstances relative to an activity for which a license or permit is 
sought. The Regional Administrator may, and upon request shall, also 
advise licensing and permitting agencies as to the status of compliance 
by dischargers with the conditions and requirements of applicable water 
quality standards. In cases where an activity for which a license or 
permit is sought will affect water quality, but for which there are no 
applicable water quality standards, the Regional Administrator may 
advise licensing or permitting agencies with respect to conditions of 
such license or permit to achieve compliance with the purpose of the 
Act.

<R04>
         Subpart A--Definitions and General Program Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 122.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Coverage. (1) These regulations contain provisions for the 
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Program under 
section 318, 402, and 405 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) (Pub. L. 92-500, 
as amended by Pub. L. 95-217, Pub. L. 95-576, Pub. L. 96-483, Pub. L. 
97-117, and Pub. L. 100-4; 33 U.S.C.1251 et seq.)
    (2) These regulations cover basic EPA permitting requirements (part 
122), what a State must do to obtain approval to operate its program in 
lieu of a Federal program and minimum requirements for administering the 
approved State program (part 123), and procedures for EPA processing of 
permit applications and appeals (part 124). Part 124 is also applicable 
to other EPA permitting programs, as detailed in that part.
    (b) Scope of the NPDES permit requirement. (1) The NPDES program 
requires permits for the discharge of ``pollutants'' from any ``point 
source'' into ``waters of the United States.'' The terms ``pollutant'', 
``point source'' and ``waters of the United States'' are defined in 
Sec. 122.2.
    (2) The following are point sources requiring NPDES permits for 
discharges:
    (i) Concentrated animal feeding operations as defined in 
Sec. 122.23;
    (ii) Concentrated aquatic animal production facilities as defined in 
Sec. 122.24;
    (iii) Discharges into aquaculture projects as set forth in 
Sec. 122.25;
    (iv) Discharges of storm water as set forth in Sec. 122.26; and

[[Page 387]]

    (v) Silvicultural point sources as defined in Sec. 122.27.
    (3) The permit program established under this part also applies to 
owners or operators of any treatment works treating domestic sewage, 
whether or not the treatment works is otherwise required to obtain an 
NPDES permit in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, unless 
all requirements implementing section 405(d) of CWA applicable to the 
treatment works treating domestic sewage are included in a permit issued 
under the appropriate provisions of subtitle C of the Solid Waste 
Disposal Act, Part C of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Marine 
Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, or the Clean Air Act, 
or under State permit programs approved by the Administrator as adequate 
to assure compliance with section 405 of the CWA.
    (4) The Regional Administrator may designate any person subject to 
the standards for sewage sludge use and disposal as a ``treatment works 
treating domestic sewage'' as defined in Sec. 122.1, where he or she 
finds that a permit is necessary to protect public health and the 
environment from the adverse effects of sewage sludge or to ensure 
compliance with the technical standards for sludge use and disposal 
developed under CWA section 405(d). Any person designated as a 
``treatment works treating domestic sewage'' shall submit an application 
for a permit under Sec. 122.21 within 180 days of being notified by the 
Regional Administrator that a permit is required. The Regional 
Administrator's decision to designate a person as a ``treatment works 
treating domestic sewage'' under this paragraph shall be stated in the 
fact sheet or statement of basis for the permit.
    (c) State programs. Certain requirements set forth in part 122 and 
124 are made applicable to approved State programs by reference in part 
123. These references are set forth in Sec. 123.25. If a section or 
paragraph of part 122 or 124 is applicable to States, through reference 
in Sec. 123.25, that fact is signaled by the following words at the end 
of the section or paragraph heading: (Applicable to State programs, see 
Sec. 123.25). If these words are absent, the section (or paragraph) 
applies only to EPA administered permits.
    (d) Relation to other requirements--(1) Permit application forms. 
Applicants for EPA issued permits must submit their applications on 
EPA's permit application forms when available. Most of the information 
requested on these application forms is required by these regulations. 
The basic information required in the general form (Form 1) and the 
additional information required for NPDES applications (Forms 2 a 
through d) are listed in Sec. 122.21. Applicants for State issued 
permits must use State forms which must require at a minimum the 
information listed in these sections.
    (2) Technical regulations. The NPDES permit program has separate 
additional regulations. These separate regulations are used by permit 
issuing authorities to determine what requirements must be placed in 
permits if they are issued. These separate regulations are located at 40 
CFR parts 125, 129, 133, 136, 40 CFR subchapter N (parts 400 through 
460), and 40 CFR part 503.
    (e) Public participation. This rule establishes the requirements for 
public participation in EPA and State permit issuance and enforcement 
and related variance proceedings, and in the approval of State NPDES 
programs. These requirements carry out the purposes of the public 
participation requirements of 40 CFR part 25 (Public Participation), and 
supersede the requirements of that part as they apply to actions covered 
under parts 122, 123, and 124.
    (f) State authorities. Nothing in part 122, 123, or 124 precludes 
more stringent State regulation of any activity covered by these 
regulations, whether or not under an approved State program.

[48 FR 14153, Apr. 1, 1983, as amended at 54 FR 18781, May 2, 1989; 55 
FR 48062, Nov. 16, 1990; 58 FR 9413, Feb. 19, 1993; 60 FR 33931, June 
29, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 122.2  Definitions.

    The following definitions apply to parts 122, 123, and 124. Terms 
not defined in this section have the meaning given by CWA. When a 
defined term appears in a definition, the defined term is sometimes 
placed in quotation marks as an aid to readers.

[[Page 388]]

    Administrator means the Administrator of the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency, or an authorized representative.
    Applicable standards and limitations means all State, interstate, 
and federal standards and limitations to which a ``discharge,'' a 
``sewage sludge use or disposal practice,'' or a related activity is 
subject under the CWA, including ``effluent limitations,'' water quality 
standards, standards of performance, toxic effluent standards or 
prohibitions, ``best management practices,'' pretreatment standards, and 
``standards for sewage sludge use or disposal'' under sections 301, 302, 
303, 304, 306, 307, 308, 403 and 405 of CWA.
    Application means the EPA standard national forms for applying for a 
permit, including any additions, revisions or modifications to the 
forms; or forms approved by EPA for use in ``approved States,'' 
including any approved modifications or revisions.
    Approved program or approved State means a State or interstate 
program which has been approved or authorized by EPA under part 123.
    Average monthly discharge limitation means the highest allowable 
average of ``daily discharges'' over a calendar month, calculated as the 
sum of all ``daily discharges'' measured during a calendar month divided 
by the number of ``daily discharges'' measured during that month.
    Average weekly discharge limitation means the highest allowable 
average of ``daily discharges'' over a calendar week, calculated as the 
sum of all ``daily discharges'' measured during a calendar week divided 
by the number of ``daily discharges'' measured during that week.
    Best management practices (``BMPs'') means schedules of activities, 
prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, and other management 
practices to prevent or reduce the pollution of ``waters of the United 
States.'' BMPs also include treatment requirements, operating 
procedures, and practices to control plant site runoff, spillage or 
leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from raw material storage.
    BMPs means ``best management practices.''
    Class I sludge management facility means any POTW identified under 
40 CFR 403.8(a) as being required to have an approved pretreatment 
program (including such POTWs located in a State that has elected to 
assume local program responsibilities pursuant to 40 CFR 403.10(e)) and 
any other treatment works treating domestic sewage classified as a Class 
I sludge management facility by the Regional Administrator, or, in the 
case of approved State programs, the Regional Administrator in 
conjunction with the State Director, because of the potential for its 
sludge use or disposal practices to adversely affect public health and 
the environment.
    Contiguous zone means the entire zone established by the United 
States under Article 24 of the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the 
Contiguous Zone.
    Continuous discharge means a ``discharge'' which occurs without 
interruption throughout the operating hours of the facility, except for 
infrequent shutdowns for maintenance, process changes, or other similar 
activities.
    CWA means the Clean Water Act (formerly referred to as the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act or Federal Water Pollution Control Act 
Amendments of 1972) Public Law 92-500, as amended by Public Law 95-217, 
Public Law 95-576, Public Law 96-483 and Public Law 97-117, 33 U.S.C. 
1251 et seq.
    CWA and regulations means the Clean Water Act (CWA) and applicable 
regulations promulgated thereunder. In the case of an approved State 
program, it includes State program requirements.
    Daily discharge means the ``discharge of a pollutant'' measured 
during a calendar day or any 24-hour period that reasonably represents 
the calendar day for purposes of sampling. For pollutants with 
limitations expressed in units of mass, the ``daily discharge'' is 
calculated as the total mass of the pollutant discharged over the day. 
For pollutants with limitations expressed in other units of measurement, 
the ``daily discharge'' is calculated as the average measurement of the 
pollutant over the day.
    Direct discharge means the ``discharge of a pollutant.''

[[Page 389]]

    Director means the Regional Administrator or the State Director, as 
the context requires, or an authorized representative. When there is no 
``approved State program,'' and there is an EPA administered program, 
``Director'' means the Regional Administrator. When there is an approved 
State program, ``Director'' normally means the State Director. In some 
circumstances, however, EPA retains the authority to take certain 
actions even when there is an approved State program. (For example, when 
EPA has issued an NPDES permit prior to the approval of a State program, 
EPA may retain jurisdiction over that permit after program approval, see 
Sec. 123.1.) In such cases, the term ``Director'' means the Regional 
Administrator and not the State Director.
    Discharge when used without qualification means the ``discharge of a 
pollutant.''
    Discharge of a pollutant means:
    (a) Any addition of any ``pollutant'' or combination of pollutants 
to ``waters of the United States'' from any ``point source,'' or
    (b) Any addition of any pollutant or combination of pollutants to 
the waters of the ``contiguous zone'' or the ocean from any point source 
other than a vessel or other floating craft which is being used as a 
means of transportation.

This definition includes additions of pollutants into waters of the 
United States from: surface runoff which is collected or channelled by 
man; discharges through pipes, sewers, or other conveyances owned by a 
State, municipality, or other person which do not lead to a treatment 
works; and discharges through pipes, sewers, or other conveyances, 
leading into privately owned treatment works. This term does not include 
an addition of pollutants by any ``indirect discharger.''
    Discharge Monitoring Report (``DMR'') means the EPA uniform national 
form, including any subsequent additions, revisions, or modifications 
for the reporting of self-monitoring results by permittees. DMRs must be 
used by ``approved States'' as well as by EPA. EPA will supply DMRs to 
any approved State upon request. The EPA national forms may be modified 
to substitute the State Agency name, address, logo, and other similar 
information, as appropriate, in place of EPA's.
    DMR means ``Discharge Monitoring Report.''
    Draft permit means a document prepared under Sec. 124.6 indicating 
the Director's tentative decision to issue or deny, modify, revoke and 
reissue, terminate, or reissue a ``permit.'' A notice of intent to 
terminate a permit, and a notice of intent to deny a permit, as 
discussed in Sec. 124.5, are types of ``draft permits.'' A denial of a 
request for modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination, as 
discussed in Sec. 124.5, is not a ``draft permit.'' A ``proposed 
permit'' is not a ``draft permit.''
    Effluent limitation means any restriction imposed by the Director on 
quantities, discharge rates, and concentrations of ``pollutants'' which 
are ``discharged'' from ``point sources'' into ``waters of the United 
States,'' the waters of the ``contiguous zone,'' or the ocean.
    Effluent limitations guidelines means a regulation published by the 
Administrator under section 304(b) of CWA to adopt or revise ``effluent 
limitations.''
    Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') means the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency.
    EPA means the United States ``Environmental Protection Agency.''
    Facility or activity means any NPDES ``point source'' or any other 
facility or activity (including land or appurtenances thereto) that is 
subject to regulation under the NPDES program.
    Federal Indian reservation means all land within the limits of any 
Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States 
Government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and including 
rights-of-way running through the reservation.
    General permit means an NPDES ``permit'' issued under Sec. 122.28 
authorizing a category of discharges under the CWA within a geographical 
area.
    Hazardous substance means any substance designated under 40 CFR part 
116 pursuant to section 311 of CWA.
    Indian Tribe means any Indian Tribe, band, group, or community 
recognized by the Secretary of the Interior and exercising governmental 
authority over a Federal Indian reservation.

[[Page 390]]

    Indirect discharger means a nondomestic discharger introducing 
``pollutants'' to a ``publicly owned treatment works.''
    Interstate agency means an agency of two or more States established 
by or under an agreement or compact approved by the Congress, or any 
other agency of two or more States having substantial powers or duties 
pertaining to the control of pollution as determined and approved by the 
Administrator under the CWA and regulations.
    Major facility means any NPDES ``facility or activity'' classified 
as such by the Regional Administrator, or, in the case of ``approved 
State programs,'' the Regional Administrator in conjunction with the 
State Director.
    Maximum daily discharge limitation means the highest allowable 
``daily discharge.''
    Municipality means a city, town, borough, county, parish, district, 
association, or other public body created by or under State law and 
having jurisdiction over disposal of sewage, industrial wastes, or other 
wastes, or an Indian tribe or an authorized Indian tribal organization, 
or a designated and approved management agency under section 208 of CWA.
    National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) means the 
national program for issuing, modifying, revoking and reissuing, 
terminating, monitoring and enforcing permits, and imposing and 
enforcing pretreatment requirements, under sections 307, 402, 318, and 
405 of CWA. The term includes an ``approved program.''
    New discharger means any building, structure, facility, or 
installation:
    (a) From which there is or may be a ``discharge of pollutants;''
    (b) That did not commence the ``discharge of pollutants'' at a 
particular ``site'' prior to August 13, 1979;
    (c) Which is not a ``new source;'' and
    (d) Which has never received a finally effective NDPES permit for 
discharges at that ``site.''

This definition includes an ``indirect discharger'' which commences 
discharging into ``waters of the United States'' after August 13, 1979. 
It also includes any existing mobile point source (other than an 
offshore or coastal oil and gas exploratory drilling rig or a coastal 
oil and gas developmental drilling rig) such as a seafood processing 
rig, seafood processing vessel, or aggregate plant, that begins 
discharging at a ``site'' for which it does not have a permit; and any 
offshore or coastal mobile oil and gas exploratory drilling rig or 
coastal mobile oil and gas developmental drilling rig that commences the 
discharge of pollutants after August 13, 1979, at a ``site'' under EPA's 
permitting jurisdiction for which it is not covered by an individual or 
general permit and which is located in an area determined by the 
Regional Administrator in the issuance of a final permit to be an area 
or biological concern. In determining whether an area is an area of 
biological concern, the Regional Administrator shall consider the 
factors specified in 40 CFR 125.122(a) (1) through (10).

An offshore or coastal mobile exploratory drilling rig or coastal mobile 
developmental drilling rig will be considered a ``new discharger'' only 
for the duration of its discharge in an area of biological concern.
    New source means any building, structure, facility, or installation 
from which there is or may be a ``discharge of pollutants,'' the 
construction of which commenced:
    (a) After promulgation of standards of performance under section 306 
of CWA which are applicable to such source, or
    (b) After proposal of standards of performance in accordance with 
section 306 of CWA which are applicable to such source, but only if the 
standards are promulgated in accordance with section 306 within 120 days 
of their proposal.
    NPDES means ``National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System.''

approved State sludge management program under section 405(f) of the 
CWA, the Regional Administrator may designate any person subject to the 
standards for sewage sludge use and disposal in 40 CFR part 503 as a 
``treatment works treating domestic sewage,'' where he or she finds that 
there is a potential for adverse effects

[[Page 393]]

on public health and the environment from poor sludge quality or poor 
sludge handling, use or disposal practices, or where he or she finds 
that such designation is necessary to ensure that such person is in 
compliance with 40 CFR part 503.
    Variance means any mechanism or provision under section 301 or 316 
of CWA or under 40 CFR part 125, or in the applicable ``effluent

may be susceptible to use in interstate or foreign commerce, including 
all waters which are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide;
    (b) All interstate waters, including interstate ``wetlands;''
    (c) All other waters such as intrastate lakes, rivers, streams 
(including intermittent streams), mudflats, sandflats, ``wetlands,'' 
sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, playa lakes, or natural ponds 
the use, degradation, or destruction of which would affect or could 
affect interstate or foreign commerce including any such waters:
    (1) Which are or could be used by interstate or foreign travelers 
for recreational or other purposes;

Waste treatment systems, including treatment ponds or lagoons designed 
to meet the requirements of CWA (other than cooling ponds as defined in 
40 CFR 423.11(m) which also meet the criteria of this definition) are 
not waters of the United States. This exclusion applies only to manmade 
bodies of water which neither were originally created in waters of the 
United States (such as disposal area in wetlands) nor resulted from the 
impoundment of waters of the United States. [See Note 1 of this 
section.] Waters of the United States do not include prior converted 
cropland. Notwithstanding the determination of an area's status as prior 
converted cropland by any other federal agency, for the purposes of the 
Clean Water Act, the final authority regarding Clean Water Act 
jurisdiction remains with EPA.
    Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by 
surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to 
support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of 
vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. 
Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.
    Whole effluent toxicity means the aggregate toxic effect of an 
effluent measured directly by a toxicity test.

    Note: At 45 FR 48620, July 21, 1980, the Environmental Protection 
Agency suspended until further notice in Sec. 122.2, the last sentence, 
beginning ``This exclusion applies . . .'' in the definition of ``Waters 
of the United States.'' This revision continues that suspension.\1\

Sec. 122.3  Exclusions.

    The following discharges do not require NPDES permits:

[[Page 394]]

    (a) Any discharge of sewage from vessels, effluent from properly 
functioning marine engines, laundry, shower, and galley sink wastes, or 
any other discharge incidental to the normal operation of a vessel. This 
exclusion does not apply to rubbish, trash, garbage, or other such 
materials discharged overboard; nor to other discharges when the vessel 
is operating in a capacity other than as a means of transportation such 
as when used as an energy or mining facility, a storage facility or a 
seafood processing facility, or when secured to a storage facility or a 
seafood processing facility, or when secured to the bed of the ocean, 
contiguous zone or waters of the United States for the purpose of 
mineral or oil exploration or development.
    (b) Discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United 
States which are regulated under section 404 of CWA.
    (c) The introduction of sewage, industrial wastes or other 
pollutants into publicly owned treatment works by indirect dischargers. 
Plans or agreements to switch to this method of disposal in the future 
do not relieve dischargers of the obligation to have and comply with 
permits until all discharges of pollutants to waters of the United 
States are eliminated. (See also Sec. 122.47(b)). This exclusion does 
not apply to the introduction of pollutants to privately owned treatment 
works or to other discharges through pipes, sewers, or other conveyances 
owned by a State, municipality, or other party not leading to treatment 
works.
    (d) Any discharge in compliance with the instructions of an On-Scene 
Coordinator pursuant to 40 CFR part 300 (The National Oil and Hazardous 
Substances Pollution Contingency Plan) or 33 CFR 153.10(e) (Pollution by 
Oil and Hazardous Substances).
    (e) Any introduction of pollutants from non point-source 
agricultural and silvicultural activities, including storm water runoff 
from orchards, cultivated crops, pastures, range lands, and forest 
lands, but not discharges from concentrated animal feeding operations as 
defined in Sec. 122.23, discharges from concentrated aquatic animal 
production facilities as defined in Sec. 122.24, discharges to 
aquaculture projects as defined in Sec. 122.25, and discharges from 
silvicultural point sources as defined in Sec. 122.27.
    (f) Return flows from irrigated agriculture.
    (g) Discharges into a privately owned treatment works, except as the 
Director may otherwise require under Sec. 122.44(m).

Sec. 122.4  Prohibitions (applicable to State NPDES programs, see Sec. 123.25).

    No permit may be issued:
    (a) When the conditions of the permit do not provide for compliance 
with the applicable requirements of CWA, or regulations promulgated 
under CWA;
    (b) When the applicant is required to obtain a State or other 
appropriate certification under section 401 of CWA and Sec. 124.53 and 
that certification has not been obtained or waived;
    (c) By the State Director where the Regional Administrator has 
objected to issuance of the permit under Sec. 123.44;
    (d) When the imposition of conditions cannot ensure compliance with 
the applicable water quality requirements of all affected States;
    (e) When, in the judgment of the Secretary, anchorage and navigation 
in or on any of the waters of the United States would be substantially 
impaired by the discharge;
    (f) For the discharge of any radiological, chemical, or biological 
warfare agent or high-level radioactive waste;
    (g) For any discharge inconsistent with a plan or plan amendment 
approved under section 208(b) of CWA;
    (h) For any discharge to the territorial sea, the waters of the 
contiguous zone, or the oceans in the following circumstances:
    (1) Before the promulgation of guidelines under section 403(c) of 
CWA (for determining degradation of the waters of the territorial seas, 
the contiguous zone, and the oceans) unless the Director determines 
permit issuance to be in the public interest; or
    (2) After promulgation of guidelines under section 403(c) of CWA, 
when insufficient information exists to make a reasonable judgment 
whether the discharge complies with them.

[[Page 395]]

    (i) To a new source or a new discharger, if the discharge from its 
construction or operation will cause or contribute to the violation of 
water quality standards. The owner or operator of a new source or new 
discharger proposing to discharge into a water segment which does not 
meet applicable water quality standards or is not expected to meet those 
standards even after the application of the effluent limitations 
required by sections 301(b)(1)(A) and 301(b)(1)(B) of CWA, and for which 
the State or interstate agency has performed a pollutants load 
allocation for the pollutant to be discharged, must demonstrate, before 
the close of the public comment period, that:
    (1) There are sufficient remaining pollutant load allocations to 
allow for the discharge; and
    (2) The existing dischargers into that segment are subject to 
compliance schedules designed to bring the segment into compliance with 
applicable water quality standards.

<R05>
Sec. 122.5  Effect of a permit.

    (a) Applicable to State programs, see Sec. 123.25. (1) Except for 
any toxic effluent standards and prohibitions imposed under section 307 
of the CWA and ``standards for sewage sludge use or disposal'' under 
405(d) of the CWA, compliance with a permit during its term constitutes 
compliance, for purposes of enforcement, with sections 301, 302, 306, 
307, 318, 403, and 405 (a)-(b) of CWA. However, a permit may be 
modified, revoked and reissued, or terminated during its term for cause 
as set forth in Secs. 122.62 and 122.64.
    (2) Compliance with a permit condition which implements a particular 
``standard for sewage sludge use or disposal'' shall be an affirmative 
defense in any enforcement action brought for a violation of that 
``standard for sewage sludge use or disposal'' pursuant to sections 
405(e) and 309 of the CWA.
    (b) Applicable to State programs, See Sec. 123.25. The issuance of a 
permit does not convey any property rights of any sort, or any exclusive 
privilege.
    (c) The issuance of a permit does not authorize any injury to 
persons or property or invasion of other private rights, or any 
infringement of State or local law or regulations.

Sec. 122.6  Continuation of expiring permits.

    (a) EPA permits. When EPA is the permit-issuing authority, the 
conditions of an expired permit continue in force under 5 U.S.C. 558(c) 
until the effective date of a new permit (see Sec. 124.15) if:
    (1) The permittee has submitted a timely application under 
Sec. 122.21 which is a complete (under Sec. 122.21(e)) application for a 
new permit; and
    (2) The Regional Administrator, through no fault of the permittee 
does not issue a new permit with an effective date under Sec. 124.15 on 
or before the expiration date of the previous permit (for example, when 
issuance is impracticable due to time or resource constraints).
    (b) Effect. Permits continued under this section remain fully 
effective and enforceable.
    (c) Enforcement. When the permittee is not in compliance with the 
conditions of the expiring or expired permit the Regional Administrator 
may choose to do any or all of the following:
    (1) Initiate enforcement action based upon the permit which has been 
continued;
    (2) Issue a notice of intent to deny the new permit under 
Sec. 124.6. If the permit is denied, the owner or operator would then be 
required to cease the activities authorized by the continued permit or 
be subject to enforcement action for operating without a permit;
    (3) Issue a new permit under part 124 with appropriate conditions; 
or
    (4) Take other actions authorized by these regulations.
    (d) State continuation. (1) An EPA-issued permit does not continue 
in force beyond its expiration date under Federal law if at that time a 
State is the permitting authority. States authorized to administer the 
NPDES program may continue either EPA or State-issued permits until the 
effective date of the new permits, if State law allows. Otherwise, the 
facility or activity is operating without a permit from the time of 
expiration of the old permit to

[[Page 396]]

the effective date of the State-issued new permit.

EPA pursuant to these regulations may be claimed as confidential by the 
submitter. Any such claim must be asserted at the time of submission in 
the manner prescribed on the application form or instructions or, in the 
case of other submissions, by stamping the words ``confidential business 
information'' on each page containing such information. If no claim is 
made at the time of submission, EPA may make the information available 
to the public without further notice. If a claim is asserted, the 
information will be treated in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 
part 2 (Public Information).
    (b) Applicable to State programs, see Sec. 123.25. Claims of 
confidentiality for the following information will be denied:
    (1) The name and address of any permit applicant or permittee;
    (2) Permit applications, permits, and effluent data.
    (c) Applicable to State programs, see Sec. 123.25. Information 
required by NPDES application forms provided by the Director under 
Sec. 122.21 may not be claimed confidential. This includes information 
submitted on the forms themselves and any attachments used to supply 
information required by the forms.

permit.
    (c) Time to apply. (1) Any person proposing a new discharge, shall 
submit an application at least 180 days before the date on which the 
discharge is to commence, unless permission for a later date has been 
granted by the Director. Facilities proposing a new discharge of storm 
water associated with industrial activity shall submit an application 
180 days before that facility commences industrial activity which may 
result in a discharge of storm water associated with that industrial 
activity. Facilities described under Sec. 122.26(b)(14)(x) shall submit 
applications at least 90 days before the date on which construction is 
to commence. Different submittal dates may be required under the terms 
of applicable general permits. Persons proposing a new discharge are 
encouraged to submit their applications well in advance of the 90 or 180 
day requirements to avoid delay. See also paragraph (k) of this section 
and Sec. 122.26 (c)(1)(i)(G) and (c)(1)(ii). New discharges composed

sewage'' not addressed under paragraphs (c)(2) (i) or (ii) of this 
section must submit the information listed in paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) 
(A)-(E) of this section, to the Director within 1 year after publication 
of a standard applicable to its sewage sludge use or disposal 
practice(s). The Director shall determine when such ``treatment works 
treating domestic sewage'' must apply for a permit.
    (A) Name, mailing address and location of the ``treatment works 
treating domestic sewage;''
    (B) The operator's name, address, telephone number, ownership 
status, and status as Federal, State, private, public or other entity;

(including, where applicable, the location of any sites where sewage 
sludge is transferred for treatment, use, or disposal, as well as the 
name of the applicator or other contractor who applies the sewage sludge 
to land, if different from the ``treatment works treating domestic 
sewage,'' and the name of any distributors if the sewage sludge is sold 
or given away in a bag or similar enclosure for application to the land, 
if different from the ``treatment works treating domestic sewage'');
    (D) Annual amount of sewage sludge generated, treated, used or 
disposed (dry weight basis); and
    (E) The most recent data the ``treatment works treating domestic 
sewage'' may have on the quality of the sewage sludge.
    (iv) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(2) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this 
section, the Director may require permit applications from any 
``treatment works treating domestic sewage'' at any time if the Director 
determines that a permit is necessary to protect public health and the 
environment from any potential adverse effects that may occur from toxic 
pollutants in sewage sludge.
    (v) Any ``treatment works treating domestic sewage'' that commences 
operations after promulgation of an applicable ``standard for sewage 
sludge use or disposal'' shall submit an application to the Director at 
least 180 days prior to the date proposed for commencing operations.
    (d) Duty to reapply. (1) Any POTW with a currently effective permit 
shall submit a new application at least 180 days before the expiration

under Sec. 122.21 and paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) of this section.
    (ii) In addition to any other applicable requirements in this part, 
all POTWs and other ``treatment works treating domestic sewage,'' 
including ``sludge-only facilities,'' must submit with their 
applications the information listed at 40 CFR 501.15 (a)(2) within the 
time frames established in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (e) Completeness. The Director shall not issue a permit before 
receiving a complete application for a permit except for NPDES general 
permits. An application for a permit is complete when the Director 
receives an application form and any supplemental information which are 
completed to his or her satisfaction. The completeness of any 
application for a permit shall be

[[Page 398]]

judged independently of the status of any other permit application or 
permit for the same facility or activity. For EPA administered NPDES 
programs, an application which is reviewed under Sec. 124.3 is complete 
when the Director receives either a complete application or the 
information listed in a notice of deficiency.
    (f) Information requirements. All applicants for NPDES permits shall 
provide the following information to the Director, using the application 
form provided by the Director (additional information required of 
applicants is set forth in paragraphs (g) through (k) of this section).
    (1) The activities conducted by the applicant which require it to 
obtain an NPDES permit.
    (2) Name, mailing address, and location of the facility for which 
the application is submitted.
    (3) Up to four SIC codes which best reflect the principal products 
or services provided by the facility.
    (4) The operator's name, address, telephone number, ownership 
status, and status as Federal, State, private, public, or other entity.
    (5) Whether the facility is located on Indian lands.
    (6) A listing of all permits or construction approvals received or 
applied for under any of the following programs:
    (i) Hazardous Waste Management program under RCRA.
    (ii) UIC program under SDWA.
    (iii) NPDES program under CWA.
    (iv) Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program under the 
Clean Air Act.
    (v) Nonattainment program under the Clean Air Act.
    (vi) National Emission Standards for Hazardous Pollutants (NESHAPS) 
preconstruction approval under the Clean Air Act.
    (vii) Ocean dumping permits under the Marine Protection Research and 
Sanctuaries Act.
    (viii) Dredge or fill permits under section 404 of CWA.
    (ix) Other relevant environmental permits, including State permits.
    (7) A topographic map (or other map if a topographic map is 
unavailable) extending one mile beyond the property boundaries of the 
source, depicting the facility and each of its intake and discharge 
structures; each of its hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal 
facilities; each well where fluids from the facility are injected 
underground; and those wells, springs, other surface water bodies, and 
drinking water wells listed in public records or otherwise known to the 
applicant in the map area.
    (8) A brief description of the nature of the business.
    (g) Application requirements for existing manufacturing, commercial, 
mining, and silvicultural dischargers. Existing manufacturing, 
commercial mining, and silvicultural dischargers applying for NPDES 
permits, except for those facilities subject to the requirements of 
Sec. 122.21(h), shall provide the following information to the Director, 
using application forms provided by the Director.
    (1) Outfall location. The latitude and longitude to the nearest 15 
seconds and the name of the receiving water.
    (2) Line drawing. A line drawing of the water flow through the 
facility with a water balance, showing operations contributing 
wastewater to the effluent and treatment units. Similar processes, 
operations, or production areas may be indicated as a single unit, 
labeled to correspond to the more detailed identification under 
paragraph (g)(3) of this section. The water balance must show 
approximate average flows at intake and discharge points and between 
units, including treatment units. If a water balance cannot be 
determined (for example, for certain mining activities), the applicant 
may provide instead a pictorial description of the nature and amount of 
any sources of water and any collection and treatment measures.
    (3) Average flows and treatment. A narrative identification of each 
type of process, operation, or production area which contributes 
wastewater to the effluent for each outfall, including process 
wastewater, cooling water, and stormwater runoff; the average flow which 
each process contributes; and a description of the treatment the 
wastewater receives, including the ultimate disposal of any solid or 
fluid

[[Page 399]]

wastes other than by discharge. Processes, operations, or production 
areas may be described in general terms (for example, ``dye-making 
reactor'', ``distillation tower''). For a privately owned treatment 
works, this information shall include the identity of each user of the 
treatment works. The average flow of point sources composed of storm 
water may be estimated. The basis for the rainfall event and the method 
of estimation must be indicated.
    (4) Intermittent flows. If any of the discharges described in 
paragraph (g)(3) of this section are intermittent or seasonal, a 
description of the frequency, duration and flow rate of each discharge 
occurrence (except for stormwater runoff, spillage or leaks).
    (5) Maximum production. If an effluent guideline promulgated under 
section 304 of CWA applies to the applicant and is expressed in terms of 
production (or other measure of operation), a reasonable measure of the 
applicant's actual production reported in the units used in the 
applicable effluent guideline. The reported measure must reflect the 
actual production of the facility as required by Sec. 122.45(b)(2).
    (6) Improvements. If the applicant is subject to any present 
requirements or compliance schedules for construction, upgrading or 
operation of waste treatment equipment, an identification of the 
abatement requirement, a description of the abatement project, and a 
listing of the required and projected final compliance dates.
    (7) Effluent characteristics. Information on the discharge of 
pollutants specified in this paragraph (except information on storm 
water discharges which is to be provided as specified in Sec. 122.26). 
When ``quantitative data'' for a pollutant are required, the applicant 
must collect a sample of effluent and analyze it for the pollutant in 
accordance with analytical methods approved under 40 CFR part 136. When 
no analytical method is approved the applicant may use any suitable 
method but must provide a description of the method. When an applicant 
has two or more outfalls with substantially identical effluents, the 
Director may allow the applicant to test only one outfall and report 
that the quantitative data also apply to the substantially identical 
outfalls. The requirements in paragraphs (g)(7) (iii) and (iv) of this 
section that an applicant must provide quantitative data for certain 
pollutants known or believed to be present do not apply to pollutants 
present in a discharge solely as the result of their presence in intake 
water; however, an applicant must report such pollutants as present. 
Grab samples must be used for pH, temperature, cyanide, total phenols, 
residual chlorine, oil and grease, fecal coliform and fecal 
streptococcus. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must 
be used. However, a minimum of one grab sample may be taken for 
effluents from holding ponds or other impoundments with a retention 
period greater than 24 hours. In addition, for discharges other than 
storm water discharges, the Director may waive composite sampling for 
any outfall for which the applicant demonstrates that the use of an 
automatic sampler is infeasible and that the minimum of four (4) grab 
samples will be a representative sample of the effluent being 
discharged. For storm water discharges, all samples shall be collected 
from the discharge resulting from a storm event that is greater than 0.1 
inch and at least 72 hours from the previously measurable (greater than 
0.1 inch rainfall) storm event. Where feasible, the variance in the 
duration of the event and the total rainfall of the event should not 
exceed 50 percent from the average or median rainfall event in that 
area. For all applicants, a flow-weighted composite shall be taken for 
either the entire discharge or for the first three hours of the 
discharge. The flow-weighted composite sample for a storm water 
discharge may be taken with a continuous sampler or as a combination of 
a minimum of three sample aliquots taken in each hour of discharge for 
the entire discharge or for the first three hours of the discharge, with 
each aliquot being separated by a minimum period of fifteen minutes 
(applicants submitting permit applications for storm water discharges 
under Sec. 122.26(d) may collect flow weighted composite samples using 
different protocols with respect to the time duration between the 
collection

[[Page 400]]

of sample aliquots, subject to the approval of the Director). However, a 
minimum of one grab sample may be taken for storm water discharges from 
holding ponds or other impoundments with a retention period greater than 
24 hours. For a flow-weighted composite sample, only one analysis of the 
composite of aliquots is required. For storm water discharge samples 
taken from discharges associated with industrial activities, 
quantitative data must be reported for the grab sample taken during the 
first thirty minutes (or as soon thereafter as practicable) of the 
discharge for all pollutants specified in Sec. 122.26(c)(1). For all 
storm water permit applicants taking flow-weighted composites, 
quantitative data must be reported for all pollutants specified in 
Sec. 122.26 except pH, temperature, cyanide, total phenols, residual 
chlorine, oil and grease, fecal coliform, and fecal streptococcus. The 
Director may allow or establish appropriate site-specific sampling 
procedures or requirements, including sampling locations, the season in 
which the sampling takes place, the minimum duration between the 
previous measurable storm event and the storm event sampled, the minimum 
or maximum level of precipitation required for an appropriate storm 
event, the form of precipitation sampled (snow melt or rain fall), 
protocols for collecting samples under 40 CFR part 136, and additional 
time for submitting data on a case-by-case basis. An applicant is 
expected to ``know or have reason to believe'' that a pollutant is 
present in an effluent based on an evaluation of the expected use, 
production, or storage of the pollutant, or on any previous analyses for 
the pollutant. (For example, any pesticide manufactured by a facility 
may be expected to be present in contaminated storm water runoff from 
the facility.)
    (i)(A) Every applicant must report quantitative data for every 
outfall for the following pollutants:

Biochemial Oxygen Demand (BOD<INF>5)
Chemical Oxygen Demand
Total Organic Carbon
Total Suspended Solids
Ammonia (as N)
Temperature (both winter and summer)
pH

    (B) The Director may waive the reporting requirements for individual 
point sources or for a particular industry category for one or more of 
the pollutants listed in paragraph (g)(7)(i)(A) of this section if the 
applicant has demonstrated that such a waiver is appropriate because 
information adequate to support issuance of a permit can be obtained 
with less stringent requirements.
    (ii) Each applicant with processes in one or more primary industry 
category (see appendix A to part 122) contributing to a discharge must 
report quantitative data for the following pollutants in each outfall 
containing process wastewater:
    (A) The organic toxic pollutants in the fractions designated in 
table I of appendix D of this part for the applicant's industrial 
category or categories unless the applicant qualifies as a small 
business under paragraph (g)(8) of this section. Table II of appendix D 
of this part lists the organic toxic pollutants in each fraction. The 
fractions result from the sample preparation required by the analytical 
procedure which uses gas chromotography/mass spectrometry. A 
determination that an applicant falls within a particular industrial 
category for the purposes of selecting fractions for testing is not 
conclusive as to the applicant's inclusion in that category for any 
other purposes. [See Notes 2, 3, and 4 of this section.]
    (B) The pollutants listed in table III of appendix D of this part 
(the toxic metals, cyanide, and total phenols).
    (iii)(A) Each applicant must indicate whether it knows or has reason 
to believe that any of the pollutants in table IV of appendix D (certain 
conventional and nonconventional pollutants) is discharged from each 
outfall. If an applicable effluent limitations guideline either directly 
limits the pollutant or, by its express terms, indirectly limits the 
pollutant through limitations on an indicator, the applicant must report 
quantitative data. For every pollutant discharged which is not so 
limited in an effluent limitations guideline, the applicant must either 
report quantitative data or briefly describe the reasons the pollutant 
is expected to be discharged.

[[Page 401]]

    (B) Each applicant must indicate whether it knows or has reason to 
believe that any of the pollutants listed in table II or table III of 
appendix D (the toxic pollutants and total phenols) for which 
quantitative data are not otherwise required under paragraph (g)(7)(ii) 
of this section, is discharged from each outfall. For every pollutant 
expected to be discharged in concentrations of 10 ppb or greater the 
applicant must report quantitative data. For acrolein, acrylonitrile, 
2,4 dinitrophenol, and 2-methyl-4,6 dinitrophenol, where any of these 
four pollutants are expected to be discharged in concentrations of 100 
ppb or greater the applicant must report quantitative data. For every 
pollutant expected to be discharged in concentrations less than 10 ppb, 
or in the case of acrolein, acrylonitrile, 2,4 dinitrophenol, and 2-
methyl-4,6 dinitrophenol, in concentrations less than 100 ppb, the 
applicant must either submit quantitative data or briefly describe the 
reasons the pollutant is expected to be discharged. An applicant 
qualifying as a small business under paragraph (g)(8) of this section is 
not required to analyze for pollutants listed in table II of appendix D 
(the organic toxic pollutants).
    (iv) Each applicant must indicate whether it knows or has reason to 
believe that any of the pollutants in table V of appendix D of this part 
(certain hazardous substances and asbestos) are discharged from each 
outfall. For every pollutant expected to be discharged, the applicant 
must briefly describe the reasons the pollutant is expected to be 
discharged, and report any quantitative data it has for any pollutant.
    (v) Each applicant must report qualitative data, generated using a 
screening procedure not calibrated with analytical standards, for 
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) if it:
    (A) Uses or manufactures 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4,5,-
T); 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy) propanoic acid (Silvex, 2,4,5,-TP); 2-
(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy) ethyl, 2,2-dichloropropionate (Erbon); O,O-
dimethyl O-(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl) phosphorothioate (Ronnel); 2,4,5-
trichlorophenol (TCP); or hexachlorophene (HCP); or
    (B) Knows or has reason to believe that TCDD is or may be present in 
an effluent.
    (8) Small business exemption. An applicant which qualifies as a 
small business under one of the following criteria is exempt from the 
requirements in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(A) or (g)(7)(iii)(A) of this 
section to submit quantitative data for the pollutants listed in table 
II of appendix D of this part (the organic toxic pollutants):
    (i) For coal mines, a probable total annual production of less than 
100,000 tons per year.
    (ii) For all other applicants, gross total annual sales averaging 
less than $100,000 per year (in second quarter 1980 dollars).
    (9) Used or manufactured toxics. A listing of any toxic pollutant 
which the applicant currently uses or manufactures as an intermediate or 
final product or byproduct. The Director may waive or modify this 
requirement for any applicant if the applicant demonstrates that it 
would be unduly burdensome to identify each toxic pollutant and the 
Director has adequate information to issue the permit.
    (10) [Reserved]
    (11) Biological toxicity tests. An identification of any biological 
toxicity tests which the applicant knows or has reason to believe have 
been made within the last 3 years on any of the applicant's discharges 
or on a receiving water in relation to a discharge.
    (12) Contract analyses. If a contract laboratory or consulting firm 
performed any of the analyses required by paragraph (g)(7) of this 
section, the identity of each laboratory or firm and the analyses 
performed.
    (13) Additional information. In addition to the information reported 
on the application form, applicants shall provide to the Director, at 
his or her request, such other information as the Director may 
reasonably require to assess the discharges of the facility and to 
determine whether to issue an NPDES permit. The additional information 
may include additional quantitative data and bioassays to assess the 
relative toxicity of discharges to

[[Page 402]]

aquatic life and requirements to determine the cause of the toxicity.
    (h) Application requirements for manufacturing, commercial, mining 
and silvicultural facilities which discharge only non-process 
wastewater. Except for stormwater discharges, all manufacturing, 
commercial, mining and silvicultural dischargers applying for NPDES 
permits which discharge only non-process wastewater not regulated by an 
effluent limitations guideline or new source performance standard shall 
provide the following information to the Director, using application 
forms provided by the Director:
    (1) Outfall location. Outfall number, latitude and longitude to the 
nearest 15 seconds, and the name of the receiving water.
    (2) Discharge date (for new dischargers). Date of expected 
commencement of discharge.
    (3) Type of waste. An identification of the general type of waste 
discharged, or expected to be discharged upon commencement of 
operations, including sanitary wastes, restaurant or cafeteria wastes, 
or noncontact cooling water. An identification of cooling water 
additives (if any) that are used or expected to be used upon 
commencement of operations, along with their composition if existing 
composition is available.
    (4) Effluent characteristics. (i) Quantitative data for the 
pollutants or parameters listed below, unless testing is waived by the 
Director. The quantitative data may be data collected over the past 365 
days, if they remain representative of current operations, and must 
include maximum daily value, average daily value, and number of 
measurements taken. The applicant must collect and analyze samples in 
accordance with 40 CFR part 136. Grab samples must be used for pH, 
temperature, oil and grease, total residual chlorine, and fecal 
coliform. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be 
used. New dischargers must include estimates for the pollutants or 
parameters listed below instead of actual sampling data, along with the 
source of each estimate. All levels must be reported or estimated as 
concentration and as total mass, except for flow, pH, and temperature.
    (A) Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD<INF>5).
    (B) Total Suspended Solids (TSS).
    (C) Fecal Coliform (if believed present or if sanitary waste is or 
will be discharged).
    (D) Total Residual Chlorine (if chlorine is used).
    (E) Oil and Grease.
    (F) Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) (if non-contact cooling water is or 
will be discharged).
    (G) Total Organic Carbon (TOC) (if non-contact cooling water is or 
will be discharged).
    (H) Ammonia (as N).
    (I) Discharge Flow.
    (J) pH.
    (K) Temperature (Winter and Summer).
    (ii) The Director may waive the testing and reporting requirements 
for any of the pollutants or flow listed in paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this 
section if the applicant submits a request for such a waiver before or 
with his application which demonstrates that information adequate to 
support issuance of a permit can be obtained through less stringent 
requirements.
    (iii) If the applicant is a new discharger, he must complete and 
submit Item IV of Form 2e (see Sec. 122.21(h)(4)) by providing 
quantitative data in accordance with that section no later than two 
years after commencement of discharge. However, the applicant need not 
complete those portions of Item IV requiring tests which he has already 
performed and reported under the discharge monitoring requirements of 
his NPDES permit.
    (iv) The requirements of parts i and iii of this section that an 
applicant must provide quantitative data or estimates of certain 
pollutants do not apply to pollutants present in a discharge solely as a 
result of their presence in intake water. However, an applicant must 
report such pollutants as present. Net credit may be provided for the 
presence of pollutants in intake water if the requirements of 
Sec. 122.45(g) are met.
    (5) Flow. A description of the frequency of flow and duration of any 
seasonal or intermittent discharge (except for stormwater runoff, leaks, 
or spills).

[[Page 403]]

    (6) Treatment system.  A brief description of any system used or to 
be used.
    (7) Optional information. Any additional information the applicant 
wishes to be considered, such as influent data for the purpose of 
obtaining ``net'' credits pursuant to Sec. 122.45(g).
    (8) Certification. Signature of certifying official under 
Sec. 122.22.
    (i) Application requirements for new and existing concentrated 
animal feeding operations and aquatic animal production facilities. New 
and existing concentrated animal feeding operations (defined in 
Sec. 122.23) and concentrated aquatic animal production facilities 
(defined in Sec. 122.24) shall provide the following information to the 
Director, using the application form provided by the Director:
    (1) For concentrated animal feeding operations:
    (i) The type and number of animals in open confinement and housed 
under roof.
    (ii) The number of acres used for confinement feeding.
    (iii) The design basis for the runoff diversion and control system, 
if one exists, including the number of acres of contributing drainage, 
the storage capacity, and the design safety factor.
    (2) For concentrated aquatic animal production facilities:
    (i) The maximum daily and average monthly flow from each outfall.
    (ii) The number of ponds, raceways, and similar structures.
    (iii) The name of the receiving water and the source of intake 
water.
    (iv) For each species of aquatic animals, the total yearly and 
maximum harvestable weight.
    (v) The calendar month of maximum feeding and the total mass of food 
fed during that month.
    (j) Application requirements for new and existing POTWs. (1) The 
following POTWs shall provide the results of valid whole effluent 
biological toxicity testing to the Director:
    (i) All POTWs with design influent flows equal to or greater than 
one million gallons per day;
    (ii) All POTWs with approved pretreatment programs or POTWs required 
to develop a pretreatment program;
    (2) In addition to the POTWs listed in paragraph (j)(1) of this 
section, the Director may require other POTWs to submit the results of 
toxicity tests with their permit applications, based on consideration of 
the following factors:
    (i) The variability of the pollutants or pollutant parameters in the 
POTW effluent (based on chemical-specific information, the type of 
treatment facility, and types of industrial contributors);
    (ii) The dilution of the effluent in the receiving water (ratio of 
effluent flow to receiving stream flow);
    (iii) Existing controls on point or nonpoint sources, including 
total maximum daily load calculations for the waterbody segment and the 
relative contribution of the POTW;
    (iv) Receiving stream characteristics, including possible or known 
water quality impairment, and whether the POTW discharges to a coastal 
water, one of the Great Lakes, or a water designated as an outstanding 
natural resource; or
    (v) Other considerations (including but not limited to the history 
of toxic impact and compliance problems at the POTW), which the Director 
determines could cause or contribute to adverse water quality impacts.
    (3) For POTWs required under paragraph (j)(1) or (j)(2) of this 
section to conduct toxicity testing, POTWs shall use EPA's methods or 
other established protocols which are scientifically defensible and 
sufficiently sensitive to detect aquatic toxicity. Such testing must 
have been conducted since the last NPDES permit reissuance or permit 
modification under 40 CFR 122.62(a), whichever occurred later.
    (4) All POTWs with approved pretreatment programs shall provide the 
following information to the Director: a written technical evaluation of 
the need to revise local limits under 40 CFR 403.5(c)(1).
    (k) Application requirements for new sources and new discharges. New 
manufacturing, commercial, mining and silvicultural dischargers applying 
for NPDES permits (except for new discharges of facilities subject to 
the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section or new discharges of 
storm water

[[Page 404]]

associated with industrial activity which are subject to the 
requirements of Sec. 122.26(c)(1) and this section (except as provided 
by Sec. 122.26(c)(1)(ii)) shall provide the following information to the 
Director, using the application forms provided by the Director:
    (1) Expected outfall location. The latitude and longitude to the 
nearest 15 seconds and the name of the receiving water.
    (2) Discharge dates. The expected date of commencement of discharge.
    (3) Flows, sources of pollution, and treatment technologies--(i) 
Expected treatment of wastewater. Description of the treatment that the 
wastewater will receive, along with all operations contributing 
wastewater to the effluent, average flow contributed by each operation, 
and the ultimate disposal of any solid or liquid wastes not discharged.
    (ii) Line drawing. A line drawing of the water flow through the 
facility with a water balance as described in Sec. 122.21(g)(2).
    (iii) Intermittent flows. If any of the expected discharges will be 
intermittent or seasonal, a description of the frequency, duration and 
maximum daily flow rate of each discharge occurrence (except for 
stormwater runoff, spillage, or leaks).
    (4) Production. If a new source performance standard promulgated 
under section 306 of CWA or an effluent limitation guideline applies to 
the applicant and is expressed in terms of production (or other measure 
of operation), a reasonable measure of the applicant's expected actual 
production reported in the units used in the applicable effluent 
guideline or new source performance standard as required by 
Sec. 122.45(b)(2) for each of the first three years. Alternative 
estimates may also be submitted if production is likely to vary.
    (5) Effluent characteristics. The requirements in paragraphs 
(h)(4)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section that an applicant must 
provide estimates of certain pollutants expected to be present do not 
apply to pollutants present in a discharge solely as a result of their 
presence in intake water; however, an applicant must report such 
pollutants as present. Net credits may be provided for the presence of 
pollutants in intake water if the requirements of Sec. 122.45(g) are 
met. All levels (except for discharge flow, temperature, and pH) must be 
estimated as concentration and as total mass.
    (i) Each applicant must report estimated daily maximum, daily 
average, and source of information for each outfall for the following 
pollutants or parameters. The Director may waive the reporting 
requirements for any of these pollutants and parameters if the applicant 
submits a request for such a waiver before or with his application which 
demonstrates that information adequate to support issuance of the permit 
can be obtained through less stringent reporting requirements.
    (A) Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD).
    (B) Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD).
    (C) Total Organic Carbon (TOC).
    (D) Total Suspended Solids (TSS).
    (E) Flow.
    (F) Ammonia (as N).
    (G) Temperature (winter and summer).
    (H) pH.
    (ii) Each applicant must report estimated daily maximum, daily 
average, and source of information for each outfall for the following 
pollutants, if the applicant knows or has reason to believe they will be 
present or if they are limited by an effluent limitation guideline or 
new source performance standard either directly or indirectly through 
limitations on an indicator pollutant: all pollutants in table IV of 
appendix D of part 122 (certain conventional and nonconventional 
pollutants).
    (iii) Each applicant must report estimated daily maximum, daily 
average and source of information for the following pollutants if he 
knows or has reason to believe that they will be present in the 
discharges from any outfall:

metals, in the discharge from any outfall: Total cyanide, and total 
phenols);
    (B) The organic toxic pollutants in table II of appendix D (except 
bis (chloromethyl) ether, dichlorofluoromethane and 
trichlorofluoromethane). This requirement is waived for applicants with 
expected gross sales of less

[[Page 405]]

than $100,000 per year for the next three years, and for coal mines with 
expected average production of less than 100,000 tons of coal per year.
    (iv) The applicant is required to report that 2,3,7,8 
Tetrachlorodibenzo-P-Dioxin (TCDD) may be discharged if he uses or 
manufactures one of the following compounds, or if he knows or has 
reason to believe that TCDD will or may be present in an effluent:
    (A) 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4,5-T) (CAS 93-76-5);
    (B) 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy) propanoic acid (Silvex, 2,4,5-TP)

(CAS 299-84-3);
    (E) 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (TCP) (CAS 95-95-4); or
    (F) Hexachlorophene (HCP) (CAS 70-30-4);
    (v) Each applicant must report any pollutants listed in table V of 
appendix D (certain hazardous substances) if he believes they will be 
present in any outfall (no quantitative estimates are required unless 
they are already available).
    (vi) No later than two years after the commencement of discharge 
from the proposed facility, the applicant is required to complete and 
submit Items V and VI of NPDES application Form 2c (see Sec. 122.21(g)). 
However, the applicant need not complete those portions of Item V 
requiring tests which he has already performed and reported under the 
discharge monitoring requirements of his NPDES permit.
    (6) Engineering Report. Each applicant must report the existence of 
any technical evaluation concerning his wastewater treatment, along with 
the name and location of similar plants of which he has knowledge.
    (7) Other information. Any optional information the permittee wishes 
to have considered.
    (8) Certification. Signature of certifying official under 
Sec. 122.22.
    (l) Special provisions for applications from new sources. (1) The 
owner or operator of any facility which may be a new source(as defined 
in Sec. 122.2) and which is located in a State without an approved NPDES 
program must comply with the provisions of this paragaraph.
    (2)(i) Before beginning any on-site construction as defined in 
Sec. 122.29, the owner or operator of any facility which may be a new 
source must submit information to the Regional Administrator so that he 
or she can determine if the facility is a new source. The Regional 
Administrator may request any additional information needed to determine 
whether the facility is a new source.
    (ii) The Regional Administrator shall make an initial determination 
whether the facility is a new source within 30 days of receiving all 
necessary information under paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section.
    (3) The Regional Administrator shall issue a public notice in 
accordance with Sec. 124.10 of the new source determination under 
paragraph (k)(2) of this section. If the Regional Administrator has 
determined that the facility is a new source, the notice shall state 
that the applicant must comply with the environmental review 
requirements of 40 CFR 6.600 et seq.
    (4) Any interested person may challenge the Regional Administrator's 
initial new source determination by requesting an evidentiary hearing 
under subpart E of part 124 within 30 days of issuance of the public 
notice of the initial determination. If all parties to the evidentiary 
hearing on the determination agree, the Regional Administrator may defer 
the hearing until after a final permit decision is made, and consolidate 
the hearing on the determination with any hearing on the permit.
    (m) Variance requests by non-POTWs. A discharger which is not a 
publicly owned treatment works (POTW) may request a variance from 
otherwise applicable effluent limitations under any of the following 
statutory or regulatory provisions within the times specified in this 
paragraph:
    (1) Fundamentally different factors. (i) A request for a variance 
based on the presence of ``fundamentally different factors'' from those 
on which the effluent limitations guideline was based shall be filed as 
follows:

    (A) For a request from best practicable control technology currently 
available (BPT), by the close of the public comment period under 
Sec. 124.10.
    (B) For a request from best available technology economically 
achievable (BAT) and/or best conventional pollutant control technology 
(BCT), by no later than:
    (1) July 3, 1989, for a request based on an effluent limitation 
guideline promulgated before February 4, 1987, to the extent July 3, 
1989 is not later than that provided under previously promulgated 
regulations; or
    (2) 180 days after the date on which an effluent limitation 
guideline is published in the Federal Register for a request based on an 
effluent limitation guideline promulgated on or after February 4, 1987.
    (ii) The request shall explain how the requirements of the 
applicable regulatory and/or statutory criteria have been met.
    (2) Non-conventional pollutants. A request for a variance from the 
BAT requirements for CWA section 301(b)(2)(F) pollutants (commonly 
called ``non-conventional'' pollutants) pursuant to section 301(c) of 
CWA because of the economic capability of the owner or operator, or 
pursuant to section 301(g) of the CWA (provided however that a 
Sec. 301(g) variance may only be requested for ammonia; chlorine; color; 
iron; total phenols (4AAP) (when determined by the Administrator to be a 
pollutant covered by section 301(b)(2)(F)) and any other pollutant which 
the Administrator lists under section 301(g)(4) of the CWA) must be made 
as follows:
    (i) For those requests for a variance from an effluent limitation 
based upon an effluent limitation guideline by:
    (A) Submitting an initial request to the Regional Administrator, as 
well as to the State Director if applicable, stating the name of the 
discharger, the permit number, the outfall number(s), the applicable 
effluent guideline, and whether the discharger is requesting a section 
301(c) or section 301(g) modification or both. This request must have 
been filed not later than:
    (1) September 25, 1978, for a pollutant which is controlled by a BAT 
effluent limitation guideline promulgated before December 27, 1977; or
    (2) 270 days after promulgation of an applicable effluent limitation 
guideline for guidelines promulgated after December 27, 1977; and
    (B) Submitting a completed request no later than the close of the 
public comment period under Sec. 124.10 demonstrating that the 
requirements of Sec. 124.13 and the applicable requirements of part 125 
have been met. Notwithstanding this provision, the complete application 
for a request under section 301(g) shall be filed 180 days before EPA 
must make a decision (unless the Regional Division Director establishes 
a shorter or longer period).
    (ii) For those requests for a variance from effluent limitations not 
based on effluent limitation guidelines, the request need only comply 
with paragraph (m)(2)(i)(B) of this section and need not be preceded by 
an initial request under paragraph (m)(2)(i)(A) of this section.
    (3)-(4) [Reserved]
    (5) Water quality related effluent limitations. A modification under 
section 302(b)(2) of requirements under section 302(a) for achieving 
water quality related effluent limitations may be requested no later

permit from which the modification is sought.
    (6) Thermal discharges. A variance under CWA section 316(a) for the 
thermal component of any discharge must be filed with a timely 
application for a permit under this section, except that if thermal 
effluent limitations are established under CWA section 402(a)(1) or are 
based on water quality standards the request for a variance may be filed 
by the close of the public comment period under Sec. 124.10. A copy of 
the request as required under 40 CFR part 125, subpart H, shall be sent 
simultaneously to the appropriate State or interstate certifying agency 
as required under 40 CFR part 125. (See Sec. 124.65 for special 
procedures for section 316(a) thermal variances.)

the permit from which the modification is sought.
    (o) Expedited variance procedures and time extensions. (1) 
Notwithstanding the time requirements in paragraphs (m) and (n) of this 
section, the Director may notify a permit applicant before a draft 
permit is issued under Sec. 124.6 that the draft permit will likely 
contain limitations which are eligible for variances. In the notice the 
Director may require the applicant as a condition of consideration of 
any potential variance request to submit a request explaining how the 
requirements of part 125 applicable to the variance have been met and 
may require its submission within a specified reasonable time after 
receipt of the notice. The notice may be sent before the permit 
application has been submitted. The draft or final permit may contain 
the alternative limitations which may become effective upon final grant 
of the variance.
    (2) A discharger who cannot file a timely complete request required 
under paragraph (m)(2)(i)(B) or (m)(2)(ii) of this section may request 
an extension. The extension may be granted or denied at the discretion 
of the Director. Extensions shall be no more than 6 months in duration.
    (p) Recordkeeping. Except for information required by paragraph 
(d)(3)(ii) of this section, which shall be retained for a period of at

Sec. 122.22  Signatories to permit applications and reports (applicable to State programs, see Sec. 123.25).

    (a) Applications. All permit applications shall be signed as 
follows:
    (1) For a corporation. By a responsible corporate officer. For the 
purpose of this section, a responsible corporate officer means: (i) A 
president, secretary, treasurer, or vice-president of the corporation in 
charge of a principal business function, or any other person who perfoms 
similar policy- or decision-making functions for the corporation, or 
(ii) the manager of one or more manufacturing, production, or operating 
facilities employing more than 250 persons or having gross annual sales 
or expenditures exceeding $25 million (in second-quarter 1980 dollars), 
if authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to the 
manager in accordance with corporate procedures.

    Note: EPA does not require specific assignments or delegations of 
authority to responsible corporate officers identified in 
Sec. 122.22(a)(1)(i). The Agency will presume that these responsible 
corporate officers have the requisite authority to sign permit 
applications unless the corporation has notified the Director to the 
contrary. Corporate procedures governing authority to sign permit 
applications may provide for assignment or delegation to applicable 
corporate positions under Sec. 122.22(a)(1)(ii) rather than to specific 
individuals.

    (2) For a partnership or sole proprietorship. By a general partner 
or the proprietor, respectively; or
    (3) For a municipality, State, Federal, or other public agency. By 
either a principal executive officer or ranking elected official. For 
purposes of this section, a principal executive officer of a Federal 
agency includes: (i) The chief executive officer of the agency, or (ii) 
a senior executive officer having responsibility for the overall 
operations of a principal geographic unit of the agency (e.g., Regional 
Administrators of EPA).
    (b) All reports required by permits, and other information requested 
by the Director shall be signed by a person described in paragraph (a) 
of this section, or by a duly authorized representative of that person. 
A person is a duly authorized representative only if:
    (1) The authorization is made in writing by a person described in 
paragraph (a) of this section;
    (2) The authorization specifies either an individual or a position 
having responsibility for the overall operation of the regulated 
facility or activity such as the position of plant manager, operator of 
a well or a well field, superintendent, position of equivalent 
responsibility, or an individual or position having overall 
responsibility for environmental matters for the company, (A duly 
authorized representative may thus be either a named individual or any 
individual occupying a named position.) and,
    (3) The written authorization is submitted to the Director.
    (c) Changes to authorization. If an authorization under paragraph 
(b) of this section is no longer accurate because a different individual 
or position has responsibility for the overall operation of the 
facility, a new authorization satisfying the requirements of paragraph 
(b) of this section must be submitted to the Director prior to or 
together with

[[Page 409]]

any reports, information, or applications to be signed by an authorized 
representative.
    (d) Certification. Any person signing a document under paragraph (a) 
or (b) of this section shall make the following certification:

    I certify under penalty of law that this document and all 
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in 
accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel 
properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my 
inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons 
directly responsible for gathering the information, the information 
submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, 
and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for 
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and 
imprisonment for knowing violations.

sewer systems. In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) 
of this section, an operator of a storm water discharge associated with 
industrial activity which discharges through a large or medium municipal 
separate storm sewer system shall submit, to the operator of the 
municipal separate storm sewer system receiving the discharge no later 
than May 15, 1991, or 180 days prior to commencing such discharge: the 
name of the facility; a contact person and phone number; the location of 
the discharge; a description, including Standard Industrial 
Classification, which best reflects the principal products or services 
provided by each facility; and any existing NPDES permit number.
    (5) Other municipal separate storm sewers. The Director may issue 
permits for municipal separate storm sewers that are designated under 
paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section on a system-wide basis, 
jurisdiction-wide basis, watershed basis or other appropriate basis, or 
may issue permits for individual discharges.
    (6) Non-municipal separate storm sewers. For storm water discharges 
associated with industrial activity from point sources which discharge 
through a non-municipal or non-publicly owned separate storm sewer 
system, the Director, in his discretion, may issue: a single NPDES 
permit, with each discharger a co-permittee to a permit issued to the 
operator of the portion of the system that discharges into waters of the 
United States; or, individual permits to each discharger of storm water 
associated with industrial activity through the non-municipal conveyance 
system.
    (i) All storm water discharges associated with industrial activity 
that discharge through a storm water discharge system that is not a 
municipal separate storm sewer must be covered by an individual permit, 
or a permit issued to the operator of the portion of the system that 
discharges to waters of the United States, with each discharger to the 
non-municipal conveyance a co-permittee to that permit.
    (ii) Where there is more than one operator of a single system of 
such conveyances, all operators of storm water discharges associated 
with industrial activity must submit applications.
    (iii) Any permit covering more than one operator shall identify the 
effluent limitations, or other permit conditions, if any, that apply to 
each operator.
    (7) Combined sewer systems. Conveyances that discharge storm water 
runoff combined with municipal sewage are point sources that must obtain 
NPDES permits in accordance with the procedures of Sec. 122.21 and are 
not subject to the provisions of this section.
    (8) Whether a discharge from a municipal separate storm sewer is or 
is not subject to regulation under this section shall have no bearing on 
whether the owner or operator of the discharge is eligible for funding 
under title II, title III or title VI of the Clean Water Act. See 40 CFR 
part 35, subpart I, appendix A(b)H.2.j.
    (9) On and after October 1, 1994, dischargers composed entirely of 
storm water, that are not otherwise already required by paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section to obtain a permit, shall be required to apply for and 
obtain a permit according to the application requirements in paragraph 
(g) of this section. The Director may not require a permit for 
discharges of storm water as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section or agricultural storm water runoff which is exempted from the 
definition of point source at Secs. 122.2 and 122.3.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Co-permittee means a permittee to a NPDES 
permit that is only responsible for permit conditions relating to the 
discharge for which it is operator.
    (2) Illicit discharge means any discharge to a municipal separate 
storm sewer that is not composed entirely of storm water except 
discharges pursuant to a NPDES permit (other than the NPDES permit for 
discharges from the municipal separate storm sewer) and discharges 
resulting from fire fighting activities.

representing a group of applicants (except facilities that have existing 
individual NPDES permits for storm water) that are part of the same 
subcategory (see 40 CFR subchapter N, part 405 to 471) or, where such 
grouping is inapplicable, are sufficiently similar as to be appropriate 
for general permit coverage under Sec. 122.28 of this part. The part 1 
application shall be submitted to the Office of Water Enforcement and 
Permits, U.S. EPA, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460 (EN-336) for 
approval. Once a part 1 application is approved, group applicants are to 
submit Part 2 of the group application to the Office of Water 
Enforcement and Permits. A group application shall consist of:
    (i) Part 1. Part 1 of a group application shall:
    (A) Identify the participants in the group application by name and 
location. Facilities participating in the group application shall be 
listed in nine subdivisions, based on the facility location relative to 
the nine precipitation zones indicated in appendix E to this part.

activities of participants of the group application and explaining why 
the participants, as a whole, are sufficiently similar to be a covered 
by a general permit;
    (C) Include a list of significant materials stored exposed to 
precipitation by participants in the group application and materials 
management practices employed to diminish contact by these materials 
with precipitation and storm water runoff;
    (D) For groups of more than 1,000 members, identify at least 100 
dischargers participating in the group application from which 
quantitative data will be submitted. For groups of 100 or more members, 
identify a minimum of ten percent of the dischargers participating in 
the group application from

[[Page 419]]

which quantitative data will be submitted. For groups of between 21 and 
99 members identify a minimum of ten dischargers participating in the 
group application from which quantitative data will be submitted. For 
groups of 4 to 20 members, identify a minimum of 50 percent of the 
dischargers participating in the group application from which 
quantitative data will be submitted. For groups with more than 10 
members, either a minimum of two dischargers from each precipitation 
zone indicated in appendix E of this part in which ten or more members 
of the group are located, or one discharger from each precipitation zone 
indicated in appendix E of this part in which nine or fewer members of 
the group are located, must be identified to submit quantitative data. 
For groups of 4 to 10 members, at least one facility in each 
precipitation zone indicated in appendix E of this part in which members 
of the group are located must be identifed to submit quantitative data. 
A description of why the facilities selected to perform sampling and 
analysis are representative of the group as a whole in terms of the 
information provided in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(B) and (c)(1)(i)(C) of this 
section, shall accompany this section. Different factors impacting the 
nature of the storm water discharges, such as the processes used and 
material management, shall be represented, to the extent feasible, in a 
manner roughly equivalent to their proportion in the group.
    (ii) Part 2. Part 2 of a group application shall contain 
quantitative data (NPDES Form 2F), as modified by paragraph (c)(1) of

sources of suspected illegal or illicit activity;
    (4) Field screening points shall be located to the degree 
practicable at the farthest manhole or other accessible location 
downstream in the system, within each cell; however, safety of personnel 
and accessibility of the location should be considered in making this 
determination;
    (5) Hydrological conditions; total drainage area of the site; 
population density of the site; traffic density; age of the structures 
or buildings in the area; history of the area; and land use types;
    (6) For medium municipal separate storm sewer systems, no more than 
250 cells need to have identified field screening points; in large 
municipal separate storm sewer systems, no more than 500 cells need to 
have identified field screening points; cells established by the grid 
that contain no storm sewer segments will be eliminated from 
consideration; if fewer than 250 cells in medium municipal sewers are 
created, and fewer than 500 in large systems are created by the overlay 
on the municipal sewer map, then all those cells which contain a segment 
of the sewer system shall be subject to field screening (unless access 
to the separate storm sewer system is impossible); and
    (7) Large or medium municipal separate storm sewer systems which are 
unable to utilize the procedures described in paragraphs (d)(1)(iv)(D) 
(1) through (6) of this section, because a sufficiently detailed map of 
the separate storm sewer systems is unavailable, shall field screen no 
more than 500 or 250 major outfalls respectively (or all major outfalls 
in the system, if less); in such circumstances, the applicant shall 
establish a grid system consisting of north-south and east-west lines 
spaced \1/4\ mile apart as an overlay to the boundaries of the municipal 
storm sewer system, thereby creating a series of cells; the applicant 
will then select major outfalls in as many cells as possible until at 
least 500 major outfalls (large municipalities) or 250 major outfalls 
(medium municipalities) are selected; a field screening analysis shall 
be undertaken at these major outfalls.
    (E) Characterization plan. Information and a proposed program to 
meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section. Such 
description shall include: the location of outfalls or field screening

field screening point is representative, the seasons during which 
sampling is intended, a description of the sampling equipment. The 
proposed location of outfalls or field screening points for such 
sampling should reflect water quality concerns (see paragraph 
(d)(1)(iv)(C) of this section) to the extent practicable.
    (v) Management programs. (A) A description of the existing 
management programs to control pollutants from the municipal separate 
storm sewer system. The description shall provide information on 
existing structural and source controls, including operation

by May 17, 1993.
    (5) A permit application shall be submitted to the Director within 
60 days of notice, unless permission for a later date is granted by the 
Director (see 40 CFR 124.52(c)), for:
    (i) A storm water discharge which the Director, or in States with 
approved NPDES programs, either the Director or the EPA Regional 
Administrator, determines that the discharge contributes to a violation 
of a water quality standard or is a significant contributor of 
pollutants to waters of the United States (see paragraph (a)(1)(v) of 
this section);
    (ii) A storm water discharge subject to paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this 
section.
    (6) Facilities with existing NPDES permits for storm water 
discharges associated with industrial activity shall maintain existing

for storm water discharges associated with industrial activity no later 
than May 17, 1994, or, for any such municipality which fails to submit a 
complete Part II group permit application by May 17, 1993, one year 
after receipt of a complete permit application;
    (ii) The Director shall issue or deny permits for large municipal 
separate

[[Page 428]]

storm sewer systems no later than November 16, 1993, or, for new sources

application;
    (iii) The Director shall issue or deny permits for medium municipal 
separate storm sewer systems no later than May 17, 1994, or, for new 
sources or existing sources which fail to submit a complete permit 
application by May 17, 1993, one year after receipt of a complete permit 
application.
    (f) Petitions. (1) Any operator of a municipal separate storm sewer 
system may petition the Director to require a separate NPDES permit (or 
a permit issued under an approved NPDES State program) for any discharge 
into the municipal separate storm sewer system.
    (2) Any person may petition the Director to require a NPDES permit 
for a discharge which is composed entirely of storm water which 
contributes to a violation of a water quality standard or is a 
significant contributor of pollutants to waters of the United States.
    (3) The owner or operator of a municipal separate storm sewer system 
may petition the Director to reduce the Census estimates of the 
population served by such separate system to account for storm water 
discharged to combined sewers as defined by 40 CFR 35.2005(b)(11) that 
is treated in a publicly owned treatment works. In municipalities in 
which combined sewers are operated, the Census estimates of population 
may be reduced proportional to the fraction, based on estimated lengths, 
of the length of combined sewers over the sum of the length of combined 
sewers and municipal separate storm sewers where an applicant has 
submitted the NPDES permit number associated with each discharge point 
and a map indicating areas served by combined sewers and the location of 
any combined sewer overflow discharge point.
    (4) Any person may petition the Director for the designation of a 
large or medium municipal separate storm sewer system as defined by 
paragraphs (b)(4)(iv) or (b)(7)(iv) of this section.
    (5) The Director shall make a final determination on any petition 
received under this section within 90 days after receiving the petition.
    (g) Application requirements for discharges composed entirely of 
storm water under Clean Water Act section 402(p)(6). Any operator of a 
point source required to obtain a permit under paragraph (a)(9) of this 
section shall submit an application in accordance with the following 
requirements.
    (1) Application deadlines. The operator shall submit an application 
in accordance with the following deadlines:
    (i) A discharger which the Director determines to contribute to a 
violation of a water quality standard or is a significant contributor of 
pollutants to waters of the United States shall apply for a permit to 
the Director within 180 days of receipt of notice, unless permission for 
a later date is granted by the Director (see 40 CFR 124.52(c)); or
    (ii) All other dischargers shall apply to the Director no later than 
August 7, 2001.
    (2) Application requirements. The operator shall submit an 
application in accordance with the following requirements, unless 
otherwise modified by the Director:
    (i) Individual application for non-municipal discharges. The 
requirements contained in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Application requirements for municipal separate storm sewer 
discharges. The requirements contained in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (iii) Notice of intent to be covered by a general permit issued by 
the Director. The requirements contained in 40 CFR 122.28(b)(2).

Sec. 122.27  Silvicultural activities (applicable to State NPDES programs, see Sec. 123.25).

    (a) Permit requirement. Silvicultural point sources, as defined in 
this section, as point sources subject to the NPDES permit program.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Silvicultural point source means any 
discernible, confined and discrete conveyance related to rock crushing, 
gravel washing, log

[[Page 429]]

sorting, or log storage facilities which are operated in connection with 
silvicultural activities and from which pollutants are discharged into 
waters of the United States. The term does not include non-point source 
silvicultural activities such as nursery operations, site preparation, 
reforestation and subsequent cultural treatment, thinning, prescribed 
burning, pest and fire control, harvesting operations, surface drainage, 
or road construction and maintenance from which there is natural runoff. 
However, some of these activities (such as stream crossing for roads) 
may involve point source discharges of dredged or fill material which 
may require a CWA section 404 permit (See 33 CFR 209.120 and part 233).
    (2) Rock crushing and gravel washing facilities means facilities 
which process crushed and broken stone, gravel, and riprap (See 40 CFR 
part 436, subpart B, including the effluent limitations guidelines).
    (3) Log sorting and log storage facilities means facilities whose 
discharges result from the holding of unprocessed wood, for example, 
logs or roundwood with bark or after removal of bark held in self-
contained bodies of water (mill ponds or log ponds) or stored on land 
where water is applied intentionally on the logs (wet decking). (See 40 
CFR part 429, subpart I, including the effluent limitations guidelines).


<R05>
Sec. 122.28  General permits (applicable to State NPDES programs, see Sec. 123.25).

    (a) Coverage. The Director may issue a general permit in accordance 
with the following:
    (1) Area. The general permit shall be written to cover a category of 
discharges or sludge use or disposal practices or facilities described 
in the permit under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, except those 
covered by individual permits, within a geographic area. The area shall 
correspond to existing geographic or political boundaries, such as:
    (i) Designated planning areas under sections 208 and 303 of CWA;
    (ii) Sewer districts or sewer authorities;
    (iii) City, county, or State political boundaries;
    (iv) State highway systems;
    (v) Standard metropolitan statistical areas as defined by the Office 
of Management and Budget;
    (vi) Urbanized areas as designated by the Bureau of the Census 
according to criteria in 30 FR 15202 (May 1, 1974); or
    (vii) Any other appropriate division or combination of boundaries.
    (2) Sources. The general permit may be written to regulate, within 
the area described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, either:
    (i) Storm water point sources; or
    (ii) A category of point sources other than storm water point 
sources, or a category of ``treatment works treating domestic sewage,'' 
if the sources or ``treatment works treating domestic sewage'' all:
    (A) Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations;
    (B) Discharge the same types of wastes or engage in the same types 
of sludge use or disposal practices;
    (C) Require the same effluent limitations, operating conditions, or 
standards for sewage sludge use or disposal;
    (D) Require the same or similar monitoring; and
    (E) In the opinion of the Director, are more appropriately 
controlled under a general permit than under individual permits.
    (b) Administration. (1) In general. General permits may be issued, 
modified, revoked and reissued, or terminated in accordance with 
applicable requirements of part 124 or corresponding State regulations. 
Special procedures for issuance are found at Sec. 123.44 for States and 
Sec. 124.58 for EPA.
    (2) Authorization to discharge, or authorization to engage in sludge 
use and disposal practices. (i) Except as provided in paragraphs 
(b)(2)(v) and (b)(2)(vi) of this section, dischargers (or treatment 
works treating domestic sewage) seeking coverage under a general permit 
shall submit to the Director a written notice of intent to be covered by 
the general permit. A discharger (or treatment works treating domestic 
sewage) who fails to submit a notice of intent in accordance with the 
terms of the permit is not authorized to discharge,

[[Page 430]]

(or in the case of sludge disposal permit, to engage in a sludge use or 
disposal practice), under the terms of the general permit unless the 
general permit, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, 
contains a provision that a notice of intent is not required or the 
Director notifies a discharger (or treatment works treating domestic 
sewage) that it is covered by a general permit in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section. A complete and timely, notice of 
intent (NOI), to be covered in accordance with general permit 
requirements, fulfills the requirements for permit applications for 
purposes of Secs. 122.6, 122.21 and 122.26.
    (ii) The contents of the notice of intent shall be specified in the 
general permit and shall require the submission of information necessary 
for adequate program implementation, including at a minimum, the legal 
name and address of the owner or operator, the facility name and 
address, type of facility or discharges, and the receiving stream(s). 
General permits for storm water discharges associated with industrial 
activity from inactive mining, inactive oil and gas operations, or 
inactive landfills occurring on Federal lands where an operator cannot 
be identified may contain alternative notice of intent requirements. All 
notices of intent shall be signed in accordance with Sec. 122.22.
    (iii) General permits shall specify the deadlines for submitting 
notices of intent to be covered and the date(s) when a discharger is 
authorized to discharge under the permit;
    (iv) General permits shall specify whether a discharger (or 
treatment works treating domestic sewage) that has submitted a complete 
and timely notice of intent to be covered in accordance with the general 
permit and that is eligible for coverage under the permit, is authorized 
to discharge, (or in the case of a sludge disposal permit, to engage in 
a sludge use or disposal practice), in accordance with the permit either 
upon receipt of the notice of intent by the Director, after a waiting 
period specified in the general permit, on a date specified in the 
general permit, or upon receipt of notification of inclusion by the 
Director. Coverage may be terminated or revoked in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (v) Discharges other than discharges from publicly owned treatment 
works, combined sewer overflows, primary industrial facilities, and 
storm water discharges associated with industrial activity, may, at the 
discretion of the Director, be authorized to discharge under a general 
permit without submitting a notice of intent where the Director finds 
that a notice of intent requirement would be inappropriate. In making 
such a finding, the Director shall consider: the type of discharge; the 
expected nature of the discharge; the potential for toxic and 
conventional pollutants in the discharges; the expected volume of the 
discharges; other means of identifying discharges covered by the permit; 
and the estimated number of discharges to be covered by the permit. The 
Director shall provide in the public notice of the general permit the 
reasons for not requiring a notice of intent.
    (vi) The Director may notify a discharger (or treatment works 
treating domestic sewage) that it is covered by a general permit, even 
if the discharger (or treatment works treating domestic sewage) has not 
submitted a notice of intent to be covered. A discharger (or treatment 
works treating domestic sewage) so notified may request an individual 
permit under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (3) Requiring an individual permit. (i) The Director may require any 
discharger authorized by a general permit to apply for and obtain an 
individual NPDES permit. Any interested person may petition the Director 
to take action under this paragraph. Cases where an individual NPDES 
permit may be required include the following:
    (A) The discharger or ``treatment works treating domestic sewage'' 
is not in compliance with the conditions of the general NPDES permit;
    (B) A change has occurred in the availability of demonstrated 
technology or practices for the control or abatement of pollutants 
applicable to the point source or treatment works treating domestic 
sewage;

[[Page 431]]

    (C) Effluent limitation guidelines are promulgated for point sources 
covered by the general NPDES permit;
    (D) A Water Quality Management plan containing requirements 
applicable to such point sources is approved;
    (E) Circumstances have changed since the time of the request to be 
covered so that the discharger is no longer appropriately controlled 
under the general permit, or either a temporary or permanent reduction 
or elimination of the authorized discharge is necessary;
    (F) Standards for sewage sludge use or disposal have been 
promulgated for the sludge use and disposal practice covered by the 
general NPDES permit; or
    (G) The discharge(s) is a significant contributor of pollutants. In 
making this determination, the Director may consider the following 
factors:
    (1) The location of the discharge with respect to waters of the 
United States;
    (2) The size of the discharge;
    (3) The quantity and nature of the pollutants discharged to waters 
of the United States; and
    (4) Other relevant factors;
    (ii) For EPA issued general permits only, the Regional Administrator 
may require any owner or operator authorized by a general permit to 
apply for an individual NPDES permit as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i) 
of this section, only if the owner or operator has been notified in 
writing that a permit application is required. This notice shall include 
a brief statement of the reasons for this decision, an application form, 
a statement setting a time for the owner or operator to file the 
application, and a statement that on the effective date of the 
individual NPDES permit the general permit as it applies to the 
individual permittee shall automatically terminate. The Director may 
grant additional time upon request of the applicant.
    (iii) Any owner or operator authorized by a general permit may 
request to be excluded from the coverage of the general permit by 
applying for an individual permit. The owner or operator shall submit an 
application under Sec. 122.21, with reasons supporting the request, to 
the Director no later than 90 days after the publication by EPA of the 
general permit in the Federal Register or the publication by a State in 
accordance with applicable State law. The request shall be processed 
under part 124 or applicable State procedures. The request shall be 
granted by issuing of any individual permit if the reasons cited by the 
owner or operator are adequate to support the request.
    (iv) When an individual NPDES permit is issued to an owner or 
operator otherwise subject to a general NPDES permit, the applicability 
of the general permit to the individual NPDES permittee is automatically 
terminated on the effective date of the individual permit.
    (v) A source excluded from a general permit solely because it 
already has an individual permit may request that the individual permit 
be revoked, and that it be covered by the general permit. Upon 
revocation of the individual permit, the general permit shall apply to 
the source.
    (c) Offshore oil and gas facilities (Not applicable to State 
programs). (1) The Regional Administrator shall, except as provided 
below, issue general permits covering discharges from offshore oil and 
gas exploration and production facilities within the Region's 
jurisdiction. Where the offshore area includes areas, such as areas of 
biological concern, for which separate permit conditions are required, 
the Regional Administrator may issue separate general permits, 
individual permits, or both. The reason for separate general permits or 
individual permits shall be set forth in the appropriate fact sheets or 
statements of basis. Any statement of basis or fact sheet for a draft 
permit shall include the Regional Administrator's tentative 
determination as to whether the permit applies to ``new sources,'' ``new 
dischargers,'' or existing sources and the reasons for this 
determination, and the Regional Administrator's proposals as to areas of 
biological concern subject either to separate individual or general 
permits. For Federally leased lands, the general permit area should 
generally be no less extensive than the lease sale area defined by the 
Department of the Interior.
    (2) Any interested person, including any prospective permittee, may 
petition the Regional Administrator to

[[Page 432]]

issue a general permit. Unless the Regional Administrator determines 
under paragraph (c)(1) of this section that no general permit is 
appropriate, he shall promptly provide a project decision schedule 
covering the issuance of the general permit or permits for any lease 
sale area for which the Department of the Interior has published a draft 
environmental impact statement. The project decision schedule shall meet 
the requirements of Sec. 124.3(g), and shall include a schedule 
providing for the issuance of the final general permit or permits not 
later than the date of the final notice of sale projected by the 
Department of the Interior or six months after the date of the request, 
whichever is later. The Regional Administrator may, at his discretion, 
issue a project decision schedule for offshore oil and gas facilities in 
the territorial seas.
    (3) Nothing in this paragraph (c) shall affect the authority of the 
Regional Administrator to require an individual permit under 
Sec. 122.28(b)(3)(i) (A) through (G).

<R05>
Sec. 122.29  New sources and new dischargers.

    (a) Definitions. (1) New source and new discharger are defined in 
Sec. 122.2. [See Note 2.]
    (2) Source means any building, structure, facility, or installation 
from which there is or may be a discharge of pollutants.
    (3) Existing source means any source which is not a new source or a 
new discharger.
    (4) Site is defined in Sec. 122.2;
    (5) Facilities or equipment means buildings, structures, process or 
production equipment or machinery which form a permanent part of the new 
source and which will be used in its operation, if these facilities or 
equipment are of such value as to represent a substantial commitment to 
construct. It excludes facilities or equipment used in connection with 
feasibility, engineering, and design studies regarding the source or 
water pollution treatment for the source.
    (b) Criteria for new source determination. (1) Except as otherwise 
provided in an applicable new source performance standard, a source is a 
``new source'' if it meets the definition of ``new source'' in 
Sec. 122.2, and
    (i) It is constructed at a site at which no other source is located; 
or
    (ii) It totally replaces the process or production equipment that 
causes the discharge of pollutants at an existing source; or
    (iii) Its processes are substantially independent of an existing 
source at the same site. In determining whether these processes are 
substantially independent, the Director shall consider such factors as 
the extent to which the new facility is integrated with the existing 
plant; and the extent to which the new facility is engaged in the same 
general type of activity as the existing source.
    (2) A source meeting the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) (i), 
(ii), or (iii) of this section is a new source only if a new source 
performance standard is independently applicable to it. If there is no 
such independently applicable standard, the source is a new discharger. 
See Sec. 122.2.
    (3) Construction on a site at which an existing source is located 
results in a modification subject to Sec. 122.62 rather than a new 
source (or a new discharger) if the construction does not create a new 
building, structure, facility, or installation meeting the criteria of 
paragraph (b)(1) (ii) or (iii) of this section but otherwise alters, 
replaces, or adds to existing process or production equipment.
    (4) Construction of a new source as defined under Sec. 122.2 has 
commenced if the owner or operator has:
    (i) Begun, or caused to begin as part of a continuous on-site 
construction program:
    (A) Any placement, assembly, or installation of facilities or 
equipment; or
    (B) Significant site preparation work including clearing, excavation 
or removal of existing buildings, structures, or facilities which is 
necessary for the

[[Page 433]]

placement, assembly, or installation of new source facilities or 
equipment; or
    (ii) Entered into a binding contractual obligation for the purchase 
of facilities or equipment which are intended to be used in its 
operation with a reasonable time. Options to purchase or contracts which 
can be terminated or modified without substantial loss, and contracts 
for feasibility engineering, and design studies do not constitute a 
contractual obligation under the paragraph.
    (c) Requirement for an environmental impact statement. (1) The 
issuance of an NPDES permit to new source:
    (i) By EPA may be a major Federal action significantly affecting the 
quality of the human environment within the meaning of the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 33 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. and is 
subject to the environmental review provisions of NEPA as set out in 40 
CFR part 6, subpart F. EPA will determine whether an Environmental 
Impact Statement (EIS) is required under Sec. 122.21(k) (special 
provisions for applications from new sources) and 40 CFR part 6, subpart 
F;
    (ii) By an NPDES approved State is not a Federal action and 
therefore does not require EPA to conduct an environmental review.
    (2) An EIS prepared under this paragraph shall include a 
recommendation either to issue or deny the permit.
    (i) If the recommendation is to deny the permit, the final EIS shall 
contain the reasons for the recommendation and list those measures, if 
any, which the applicant could take to cause the recommendation to be 
changed;
    (ii) If the recommendation is to issue the permit, the final EIS 
shall recommend the actions, if any, which the permittee should take to 
prevent or minimize any adverse environmental impacts;
    (3) The Regional Administrator, to the extent allowed by law, shall 
issue, condition (other than imposing effluent limitations), or deny the 
new source NPDES permit following a complete evaluation of any 
significant beneficial and adverse impacts of the proposed action and a 
review of the recommendations contained in the EIS or finding of no 
significant impact.
    (d) Effect of compliance with new source performance standards. (The 
provisions of this paragraph do not apply to existing sources which 
modify their pollution control facilities or construct new pollution 
control facilities and achieve performance standards, but which are 
neither new sources or new dischargers or otherwise do not meet the 
requirements of this paragraph.)
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, any new 
discharger, the construction of which commenced after October 18, 1972, 
or new source which meets the applicable promulgated new source 
performance standards before the commencement of discharge, may not be 
subject to any more stringent new source performance standards or to any 
more stringent technology-based standards under section 301(b)(2) of CWA 
for the soonest ending of the following periods:
    (i) Ten years from the date that construction is completed;
    (ii) Ten years from the date the source begins to discharge process 
or other nonconstruction related wastewater; or
    (iii) The period of depreciation or amortization of the facility for 
the purposes of section 167 or 169 (or both) of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1954.
    (2) The protection from more stringent standards of performance 
afforded by paragraph (d)(1) of this section does not apply to:
    (i) Additional or more stringent permit conditions which are not 
technology based; for example, conditions based on water quality 
standards, or toxic effluent standards or prohibitions under section 
307(a) of CWA; or
    (ii) Additional permit conditions in accordance with Sec. 125.3 
controlling toxic pollutants or hazardous substances which are not 
controlled by new source performance standards. This includes permit 
conditions controlling pollutants other than those identified as toxic 
pollutants or hazardous substances when control of these pollutants has 
been specifically identified as the method to control the toxic 
pollutants or hazardous substances.
    (3) When an NPDES permit issued to a source with a ``protection 
period'' under paragraph (d)(1) of this section

[[Page 434]]

will expire on or after the expiration of the protection period, that 
permit shall require the owner or operator of the source to comply with 
the requirements of section 301 and any other then applicable 
requirements of CWA immediately upon the expiration of the protection 
period. No additional period for achieving compliance with these 
requirements may be allowed except when necessary to achieve compliance 
with requirements promulgated less than 3 years before the expiration of 
the protection period.
    (4) The owner or operator of a new source, a new discharger which 
commenced discharge after August 13, 1979, or a recommencing discharger 
shall install and have in operating condition, and shall ``start-up'' 
all pollution control equipment required to meet the conditions of its 
permits before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time 
(not to exceed 90 days), the owner or operator must meet all permit 
conditions. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply if the owner 
or operator is issued a permit containing a compliance schedule under 
Sec. 122.47(a)(2).
    (5) After the effective date of new source performance standards, it 
shall be unlawful for any owner or operator of any new source to operate

                      Subpart C--Permit Conditions


<R05>
Sec. 122.41  Conditions applicable to all permits (applicable to State programs, see Sec. 123.25).

    The following conditions apply to all NPDES permits. Additional 
conditions applicable to NPDES permits are in Sec. 122.42. All 
conditions applicable to NPDES permits shall be incorporated into the 
permits either expressly or by reference. If incorporated by reference, 
a specific citation to these regulations (or the corresponding approved 
State regulations) must be given in the permit.
    (a) Duty to comply. The permittee must comply with all conditions of 
this permit. Any permit noncompliance constitutes a violation of the 
Clean Water Act and is grounds for enforcement action; for permit 
termination, revocation and reissuance, or modification; or denial of a 
permit renewal application.
    (1) The permittee shall comply with effluent standards or 
prohibitions established under section 307(a) of the Clean Water Act for 
toxic pollutants and with standards for sewage sludge use or disposal 
established under section 405(d) of the CWA within the time provided in 
the regulations that establish these standards or prohibitions or 
standards for sewage sludge use or disposal, even if the permit has not 
yet been modified to incorporate the requirement.
    (2) The Clean Water Act provides that any person who violates 
section 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, 318 or 405 of the Act, or any permit 
condition or limitation implementing any such sections in a permit 
issued under section 402, or any requirement imposed in a pretreatment 
program approved under sections 402(a)(3) or 402(b)(8) of the Act, is 
subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 per day for each 
violation. The Clean Water Act provides that any person who negligently 
violates sections 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, 318, or 405 of the Act, or 
any condition or limitation implementing any of such sections in a 
permit issued under section 402 of the Act, or any requirement imposed 
in a pretreatment program approved under section 402(a)(3) or 402(b)(8) 
of the Act, is subject to criminal penalties of $2,500 to $25,000 per 
day of violation, or imprisonment of not more than 1 year, or both. In 
the case of a second or subsequent conviction for a negligent violation, 
a person shall be subject to criminal penalties of not more than $50,000 
per day of violation, or by imprisonment of not more than 2 years, or 
both. Any person who knowingly violates such sections, or such 
conditions or limitations is subject to criminal penalties of $5,000 to 
$50,000 per day of violation, or imprisonment for not more than 3 years, 
or both. In the case of a second or subsequent conviction for a knowing 
violation, a person shall be subject to criminal penalties of not more 
than $100,000 per day of violation, or imprisonment of not more than 6

[[Page 435]]

years, or both. Any person who knowingly violates section 301, 302, 303, 
306, 307, 308, 318 or 405 of the Act, or any permit condition or 
limitation implementing any of such sections in a permit issued under 
section 402 of the Act, and who knows at that time that he thereby 
places another person in imminent danger of death or serious bodily 
injury, shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine of not more than 
$250,000 or imprisonment of not more than 15 years, or both. In the case 
of a second or subsequent conviction for a knowing endangerment 
violation, a person shall be subject to a fine of not more than $500,000 
or by imprisonment of not more than 30 years, or both. An organization, 
as defined in section 309(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CWA, shall, upon 
conviction of violating the imminent danger provision, be subject to a 
fine of not more than $1,000,000 and can be fined up to $2,000,000 for 
second or subsequent convictions.
    (3) Any person may be assessed an administrative penalty by the 
Administrator for violating section 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, 318 or 405 
of this Act, or any permit condition or limitation implementing any of 
such sections in a permit issued under section 402 of this Act. 
Administrative penalties for Class I violations are not to exceed 
$10,000 per violation, with the maximum amount of any Class I penalty 
assessed not to exceed $25,000. Penalties for Class II violations are 
not to exceed $10,000 per day for each day during which the violation 
continues, with the maximum amount of any Class II penalty not to exceed 
$125,000.
    (b) Duty to reapply. If the permittee wishes to continue an activity 
regulated by this permit after the expiration date of this permit, the 
permittee must apply for and obtain a new permit.
    (c) Need to halt or reduce activity not a defense. It shall not be a 
defense for a permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been 
necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain 
compliance with the conditions of this permit.
    (d) Duty to mitigate. The permittee shall take all reasonable steps 
to minimize or prevent any discharge or sludge use or disposal in 
violation of this permit which has a reasonable likelihood of adversely 
affecting human health or the environment.
    (e) Proper operation and maintenance. The permittee shall at all 
times properly operate and maintain all facilities and systems of 
treatment and control (and related appurtenances) which are installed or 
used by the permittee to achieve compliance with the conditions of this 
permit. Proper operation and maintenance also includes adequate 
laboratory controls and appropriate quality assurance procedures. This 
provision requires the operation of back-up or auxiliary facilities or 
similar systems which are installed by a permittee only when the 
operation is necessary to achieve compliance with the conditions of the 
permit.
    (f) Permit actions. This permit may be modified, revoked and 
reissued, or terminated for cause. The filing of a request by the 
permittee for a permit modification, revocation and reissuance, or 
termination, or a notification of planned changes or anticipated 
noncompliance does not stay any permit condition.
    (g) Property rights. This permit does not convey any property rights 
of any sort, or any exclusive privilege.
    (h) Duty to provide information. The permittee shall furnish to the 
Director, within a reasonable time, any information which the Director 
may request to determine whether cause exists for modifying, revoking 
and reissuing, or terminating this permit or to determine compliance 
with this permit. The permittee shall also furnish to the Director upon 
request, copies of records required to be kept by this permit.
    (i) Inspection and entry. The permittee shall allow the Director, or 
an authorized representative (including an authorized contractor acting 
as a representative of the Administrator), upon presentation of 
credentials and other documents as may be required by law, to:
    (1) Enter upon the permittee's premises where a regulated facility 
or activity is located or conducted, or where records must be kept under 
the conditions of this permit;
    (2) Have access to and copy, at reasonable times, any records that 
must

[[Page 436]]

be kept under the conditions of this permit;
    (3) Inspect at reasonable times any facilities, equipment (including 
monitoring and control equipment), practices, or operations regulated or 
required under this permit; and
    (4) Sample or monitor at reasonable times, for the purposes of 
assuring permit compliance or as otherwise authorized by the Clean Water 
Act, any substances or parameters at any location.
    (j) Monitoring and records. (1) Samples and measurements taken for 
the purpose of monitoring shall be representative of the monitored 
activity.
    (2) Except for records of monitoring information required by this 
permit related to the permittee's sewage sludge use and disposal 
activities, which shall be retained for a period of at least five years 
(or longer as required by 40 CFR part 503), the permittee shall retain 
records of all monitoring information, including all calibration and 
maintenance records and all original strip chart recordings for 
continuous monitoring instrumentation, copies of all reports required by 
this permit, and records of all data used to complete the application 
for this permit, for a period of at least 3 years from the date of the 
sample, measurement, report or application. This period may be extended 
by request of the Director at any time.
    (3) Records of monitoring information shall include:
    (i) The date, exact place, and time of sampling or measurements;
    (ii) The individual(s) who performed the sampling or measurements;
    (iii) The date(s) analyses were performed;
    (iv) The individual(s) who performed the analyses;
    (v) The analytical techniques or methods used; and
    (vi) The results of such analyses.
    (4) Monitoring results must be conducted according to test 
procedures approved under 40 CFR part 136 or, in the case of sludge use 
or disposal, approved under 40 CFR part 136 unless otherwise specified 
in 40 CFR part 503, unless other test procedures have been specified in 
the permit.
    (5) The Clean Water Act provides that any person who falsifies, 
tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or 
method required to be maintained under this permit shall, upon 
conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000, or by 
imprisonment for not more than 2 years, or both. If a conviction of a 
person is for a violation committed after a first conviction of such 
person under this paragraph, punishment is a fine of not more than 
$20,000 per day of violation, or by imprisonment of not more than 4 
years, or both.
    (k) Signatory requirement. (1) All applications, reports, or 
information submitted to the Director shall be signed and certified. 
(See Sec. 122.22)
    (2) The CWA provides that any person who knowingly makes any false 
statement, representation, or certification in any record or other 
document submitted or required to be maintained under this permit, 
including monitoring reports or reports of compliance or non-compliance 
shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000 
per violation, or by imprisonment for not more than 6 months per 
violation, or by both.
    (l) Reporting requirements. (1) Planned changes. The permittee shall 
give notice to the Director as soon as possible of any planned physical 
alterations or additions to the permitted facility. Notice is required 
only when:
    (i) The alteration or addition to a permitted facility may meet one 
of the criteria for determining whether a facility is a new source in 
Sec. 122.29(b); or
    (ii) The alteration or addition could significantly change the 
nature or increase the quantity of pollutants discharged. This 
notification applies to pollutants which are subject neither to effluent 
limitations in the permit, nor to notification requirements under 
Sec. 122.42(a)(1).
    (iii) The alteration or addition results in a significant change in 
the permittee's sludge use or disposal practices, and such alteration, 
addition, or change may justify the application of permit conditions 
that are different from or absent in the existing permit, including 
notification of additional use or disposal sites not reported during the 
permit application process or not reported pursuant to an approved land 
application plan;

[[Page 437]]

    (2) Anticipated noncompliance. The permittee shall give advance 
notice to the Director of any planned changes in the permitted facility 
or activity which may result in noncompliance with permit requirements.
    (3) Transfers. This permit is not transferable to any person except 
after notice to the Director. The Director may require modification or 
revocation and reissuance of the permit to change the name of the 
permittee and incorporate such other requirements as may be necessary 
under the Clean Water Act. (See Sec. 122.61; in some cases, modification 
or revocation and reissuance is mandatory.)
    (4) Monitoring reports. Monitoring results shall be reported at the 
intervals specified elsewhere in this permit.
    (i) Monitoring results must be reported on a Discharge Monitoring 
Report (DMR) or forms provided or specified by the Director for 
reporting results of monitoring of sludge use or disposal practices.
    (ii) If the permittee monitors any pollutant more frequently than 
required by the permit using test procedures approved under 40 CFR part 
136 or, in the case of sludge use or disposal, approved under 40 CFR 
part 136 unless otherwise specified in 40 CFR part 503, or as specified 
in the permit, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the 
calculation and reporting of the data submitted in the DMR or sludge 
reporting form specified by the Director.
    (iii) Calculations for all limitations which require averaging of 
measurements shall utilize an arithmetic mean unless otherwise specified 
by the Director in the permit.
    (5) Compliance schedules. Reports of compliance or noncompliance 
with, or any progress reports on, interim and final requirements 
contained in any compliance schedule of this permit shall be submitted 
no later than 14 days following each schedule date.
    (6) Twenty-four hour reporting. (i) The permittee shall report any 
noncompliance which may endanger health or the environment. Any 
information shall be provided orally within 24 hours from the time the 
permittee becames aware of the circumstances. A written submission shall 
also be provided within 5 days of the time the permittee becomes aware 
of the circumstances. The written submission shall contain a description 
of the noncompliance and its cause; the period of noncompliance, 
including exact dates and times, and if the noncompliance has not been 
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps 
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the 
noncompliance.
    (ii) The following shall be included as information which must be 
reported within 24 hours under this paragraph.
    (A) Any unanticipated bypass which exceeds any effluent limitation 
in the permit. (See Sec. 122.41(g).
    (B) Any upset which exceeds any effluent limitation in the permit.
    (C) Violation of a maximum daily discharge limitation for any of the 
pollutants listed by the Director in the permit to be reported within 24 
hours. (See Sec. 122.44(g).)
    (iii) The Director may waive the written report on a case-by-case 
basis for reports under paragraph (l)(6)(ii) of this section if the oral 
report has been received within 24 hours.
    (7) Other noncompliance. The permittee shall report all instances of 
noncompliance not reported under paragraphs (l) (4), (5), and (6) of 
this section, at the time monitoring reports are submitted. The reports 
shall contain the information listed in paragraph (l)(6) of this 
section.
    (8) Other information. Where the permittee becomes aware that it 
failed to submit any relevant facts in a permit application, or 
submitted incorrect information in a permit application or in any report 
to the Director, it shall promptly submit such facts or information.
    (m) Bypass--(1) Definitions. (i) Bypass means the intentional 
diversion of waste streams from any portion of a treatment facility.
    (ii) Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to 
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become 
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which 
can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe 
property

[[Page 438]]

damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
    (2) Bypass not exceeding limitations. The permittee may allow any 
bypass to occur which does not cause effluent limitations to be 
exceeded, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure 
efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of 
paragraphs (m)(3) and (m)(4) of this section.
    (3) Notice--(i) Anticipated bypass. If the permittee knows in 
advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice, if 
possible at least ten days before the date of the bypass.
    (ii) Unanticipated bypass. The permittee shall submit notice of an 
unanticipated bypass as required in paragraph (l)(6) of this section 
(24-hour notice).
    (4) Prohibition of bypass. (i) Bypass is prohibited, and the 
Director may take enforcement action against a permittee for bypass, 
unless:
    (A) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, 
or severe property damage;
    (B) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the 
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or 
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition 
is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been 
installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent 
a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or 
preventive maintenance; and
    (C) The permittee submitted notices as required under paragraph 
(m)(3) of this section.
    (ii) The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after 
considering its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will 
meet the three conditions listed above in paragraph (m)(4)(i) of this 
section.
    (n) Upset--(1) Definition. Upset means an exceptional incident in 
which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with technology 
based permit effluent limitations because of factors beyond the 
reasonable control of the permittee. An upset does not include 
noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly 
designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of 
preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
    (2) Effect of an upset. An upset constitutes an affirmative defense 
to an action brought for noncompliance with such technology based permit 
effluent limitations if the requirements of paragraph (n)(3) of this 
section are met. No determination made during administrative review of 
claims that noncompliance was caused by upset, and before an action for 
noncompliance, is final administrative action subject to judicial 
review.
    (3) Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset. A permittee 
who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall 
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or 
other relevant evidence that:
    (i) An upset occurred and that the permittee can identify the 
cause(s) of the upset;
    (ii) The permitted facility was at the time being properly operated; 
and
    (iii) The permittee submitted notice of the upset as required in 
paragraph (1)(6)(ii)(B) of this section (24 hour notice).
    (iv) The permittee complied with any remedial measures required 
under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (4) Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding the permittee 
seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset has the burden of proof.

[[Page 439]]

under Sec. 122.41(1), all existing manufacturing, commercial, mining, 
and silvicultural dischargers must notify the Director as soon as they 
know or have reason to believe:
    (1) That any activity has occurred or will occur which would result 
in the discharge, on a routine or frequent basis, of any toxic pollutant 
which is not limited in the permit, if that discharge will exceed the 
highest of the following ``notification levels'':
    (i) One hundred micrograms per liter (100 <greek-m>g/l);
    (ii) Two hundred micrograms per liter (200 <greek-m>g/l) for 
acrolein and acrylonitrile; five hundred micrograms per liter (500 
<greek-m>g/l) for 2,4-dinitrophenol and for 2-methyl-4,6-dinitrophenol; 
and one milligram per liter (1 mg/l) for antimony;
    (iii) Five (5) times the maximum concentration value reported for 
that pollutant in the permit application in accordance with 
Sec. 122.21(g)(7); or
    (iv) The level established by the Director in accordance with 
Sec. 122.44(f).
    (2) That any activity has occurred or will occur which would result 
in any discharge, on a non-routine or infrequent basis, of a toxic 
pollutant which is not limited in the permit, if that discharge will 
exceed the highest of the following ``notification levels'':
    (i) Five hundred micrograms per liter (500 <greek-m>g/l);
    (ii) One milligram per liter (1 mg/l) for antimony;
    (iii) Ten (10) times the maximum concentration value reported for

    (iv) The level established by the Director in accordance with 
Sec. 122.44(f).
    (b) Publicly owned treatment works. All POTWs must provide adequate 
notice to the Director of the following:
    (1) Any new introduction of pollutants into the POTW from an 
indirect discharger which would be subject to section 301 or 306 of CWA 
if it were directly discharging those pollutants; and
    (2) Any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants 
being introduced into that POTW by a source introducing pollutants into 
the POTW at the time of issuance of the permit.
    (3) For purposes of this paragraph, adequate notice shall include 
information on (i) the quality and quantity of effluent introduced into 
the POTW, and (ii) any anticipated impact of the change on the quantity 
or quality of effluent to be discharged from the POTW.
    (c) Municipal separate storm sewer systems. The operator of a large 
or medium municipal separate storm sewer system or a municipal separate 
storm sewer that has been designated by the Director under

<R05>
Sec. 122.43  Establishing permit conditions (applicable to State programs, see Sec. 123.25).

    (a) In addition to conditions required in all permits (Secs. 122.41 
and 122.42), the Director shall establish conditions, as required on a 
case-by-case basis, to provide for and assure compliance with all 
applicable requirements of CWA and regulations. These shall include 
conditions under Secs. 122.46 (duration of permits), 122.47(a) 
(schedules of compliance), 122.48 (monitoring), and for EPA permits only 
122.47(b) (alternates schedule of compliance) and 122.49 (considerations 
under Federal law).
    (b)(1) For a State issued permit, an applicable requirement is a 
State statutory or regulatory requirement which takes effect prior to 
final administrative disposition of a permit. For a permit issued by 
EPA, an applicable requirement is a statutory or regulatory requirement 
(including any interim final regulation) which takes effect prior to the 
issuance of the permit (except as provided in Sec. 124.86(c) for NPDES 
permits being processed under subpart E or F of part 124). Section 
124.14 (reopening of comment period) provides a means for reopening EPA 
permit proceedings at the discretion of the Director where new 
requirements become effective during the permitting process and are of 
sufficient magnitude to make additonal proceedings desirable. For State 
and EPA administered programs, an applicable requirement is also any 
requirement which takes effect prior to the modification or revocation 
and reissuance of a permit, to the extent allowed in Sec. 122.62.
    (2) New or reissued permits, and to the extent allowed under 
Sec. 122.62 modified or revoked and reissued permits, shall incorporate 
each of the applicable requirements referenced in Secs. 122.44 and 
122.45.
    (c) Incorporation. All permit conditions shall be incorporated 
either expressly or by reference. If incorporated by reference, a 
specific citation to the applicable regulations or requirements must be 
given in the permit.


<R05>
Sec. 122.44  Establishing limitations, standards, and other permit conditions (applicable to State NPDES programs, see Sec. 123.25).

    In addition to the conditions established under Sec. 122.43(a), each 
NPDES permit shall include conditions meeting the following requirements 
when applicable.
    (a) Technology-based effluent limitations and standards based on 
effluent limitations and standards promulgated under section 301 of CWA 
or new source performance standards promulgated under section 306 of 
CWA, on case-by-case effluent limitations determined under section 
402(a)(1) of CWA, or on a combination of the two, in accordance with 
Sec. 125.3. For new sources or new dischargers, these technology based 
limitations and standards are subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 122.29(d) (protection period).
    (b)(1) Other effluent limitations and standards under sections 301, 
302, 303, 307, 318 and 405 of CWA. If any applicable toxic effluent 
standard or prohibition (including any schedule of compliance specified 
in such effluent standard or prohibition) is promulgated under section 
307(a) of CWA for a toxic pollutant and that standard or prohibition is 
more stringent than any limitation on the pollutant in the permit, the 
Director shall institute proceedings under these regulations to modify 
or revoke and reissue the permit to conform to the toxic effluent 
standard or prohibition. See also Sec. 122.41(a).
    (2) Standards for sewage sludge use or disposal under section 405(d) 
of the CWA unless those standards have been included in a permit issued 
under the appropriate provisions of subtitle C of the Solid Waste 
Disposal Act, Part C of Safe Drinking Water Act, the Marine Protection, 
Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, or the Clean Air Act, or under 
State permit programs approved by the Administrator. When there are no 
applicable standards for sewage sludge use or disposal, the permit may 
include requirements developed on a case-by-case basis to protect public 
health and the environment from any adverse effects which may occur from 
toxic pollutants in sewage sludge. If

[[Page 441]]

any applicable standard for sewage sludge use or disposal is promulgated 
under section 405(d) of the CWA and that standard is more stringent than 
any limitation on the pollutant or practice in the permit, the Director 
may initiate proceedings under these regulations to modify or revoke and 
reissue the permit to conform to the standard for sewage sludge use or 
disposal.
    (c) Reopener clause: for any discharger within a primary industry 
category (see appendix A), requirements under section 307(a)(2) of CWA 
as follows:
    (1) On or before June 30, 1981: (i) If applicable standards or 
limitations have not yet been promulgated, the permit shall include a 
condition stating that, if an applicable standard or limitation is 
promulgated under sections 301(b)(2) (C) and (D), 304(b)(2), and 
307(a)(2) and that effluent standard or limitation is more stringent 
than any effluent limitation in the permit or controls a pollutant not 
limited in the permit, the permit shall be promptly modified or revoked 
and reissued to conform to that effluent standard or limitation.
    (ii) If applicable standards or limitations have been promulgated or 
approved, the permit shall include those standards or limitations. (If 
EPA approves existing effluent limitations or decides not to develop new 
effluent limitations, it will publish a notice in the Federal Register 
that the limitations are ``approved'' for the purpose of this 
regulation.)
    (2) On or after the statutory deadline set forth in section 
301(b)(2) (A), (C), and (E) of CWA, any permit issued shall include 
effluent limitations to meet the requirements of section 301(b)(2) (A), 
(C), (D), (E), (F), whether or not applicable effluent limitations 
guidelines have been promulgated or approved. These permits need not 
incorporate the clause required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (3) The Director shall promptly modify or revoke and reissue any 
permit containing the clause required under paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section to incorporate an applicable effluent standard or limitation 
under sections 301(b)(2) (C) and (D), 304(b)(2) and 307(a)(2) which is 
promulgated or approved after the permit is issued if that effluent 
standard or limitation is more stringent than any effluent limitation in 
the permit, or controls a pollutant not limited in the permit.
    (4) For any permit issued to a treatment works treating domestic 
sewage (including ``sludge-only facilities''), the Director shall 
include a reopener clause to incorporate any applicable standard for 
sewage sludge use or disposal promulgated under section 405(d) of the 
CWA. The Director may promptly modify or revoke and reissue any permit 
containing the reopener clause required by this paragraph if the 
standard for sewage sludge use or disposal is more stringent than any 
requirements for sludge use or disposal in the permit, or controls a 
pollutant or practice not limited in the permit.
    (d) Water quality standards and State requirements: any requirements 
in addition to or more stringent than promulgated effluent limitations 
guidelines or standards under sections 301, 304, 306, 307, 318 and 405 
of CWA necessary to:
    (1) Achieve water quality standards established under section 303 of 
the CWA, including State narrative criteria for water quality.
    (i) Limitations must control all pollutants or pollutant parameters 
(either conventional, nonconventional, or toxic pollutants) which the 
Director determines are or may be discharged at a level which will 
cause, have the reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an 
excursion above any State water quality standard, including State 
narrative criteria for water quality.
    (ii) When determining whether a discharge causes, has the reasonable 
potential to cause, or contributes to an in-stream excursion above a 
narrative or numeric criteria within a State water quality standard, the 
permitting authority shall use procedures which account for existing 
controls on point and nonpoint sources of pollution, the variability of 
the pollutant or pollutant parameter in the effluent, the sensitivity of 
the species to toxicity testing (when evaluating whole effluent 
toxicity), and where appropriate, the dilution of the effluent in the 
receiving water.
    (iii) When the permitting authority determines, using the procedures 
in

[[Page 442]]

paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, that a discharge causes, has the 
reasonable potential to cause, or contributes to an in-stream excursion 
above the allowable ambient concentration of a State numeric criteria 
within a State water quality standard for an individual pollutant, the 
permit must contain effluent limits for that pollutant.
    (iv) When the permitting authority determines, using the procedures 
in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, that a discharge causes, has 
the reasonable potential to cause, or contributes to an in-stream 
excursion above the numeric criterion for whole effluent toxicity, the 
permit must contain effluent limits for whole effluent toxicity.
    (v) Except as provided in this subparagraph, when the permitting 
authority determines, using the procedures in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of 
this section, toxicity testing data, or other information, that a 
discharge causes, has the reasonable potential to cause, or contributes 
to an in-stream excursion above a narrative criterion within an 
applicable State water quality standard, the permit must contain 
effluent limits for whole effluent toxicity. Limits on whole effluent 
toxicity are not necessary where the permitting authority demonstrates 
in the fact sheet or statement of basis of the NPDES permit, using the 
procedures in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, that chemical-
specific limits for the effluent are sufficient to attain and maintain 
applicable numeric and narrative State water quality standards.
    (vi) Where a State has not established a water quality criterion for 
a specific chemical pollutant that is present in an effluent at a 
concentration that causes, has the reasonable potential to cause, or 
contributes to an excursion above a narrative criterion within an 
applicable State water quality standard, the permitting authority must 
establish effluent limits using one or more of the following options:
    (A) Establish effluent limits using a calculated numeric water 
quality criterion for the pollutant which the permitting authority 
demonstrates will attain and maintain applicable narrative water quality 
criteria and will fully protect the designated use. Such a criterion may 
be derived using a proposed State criterion, or an explicit State policy 
or regulation interpreting its narrative water quality criterion, 
supplemented with other relevant information which may include: EPA's 
Water Quality Standards Handbook, October 1983, risk assessment data, 
exposure data, information about the pollutant from the Food and Drug 
Administration, and current EPA criteria documents; or
    (B) Establish effluent limits on a case-by-case basis, using EPA's 
water quality criteria, published under section 304(a) of the CWA, 
supplemented where necessary by other relevant information; or
    (C) Establish effluent limitations on an indicator parameter for the 
pollutant of concern, provided:
    (1) The permit identifies which pollutants are intended to be 
controlled by the use of the effluent limitation;
    (2) The fact sheet required by Sec. 124.56 sets forth the basis for 
the limit, including a finding that compliance with the effluent limit 
on the indicator parameter will result in controls on the pollutant of 
concern which are sufficient to attain and maintain applicable water 
quality standards;
    (3) The permit requires all effluent and ambient monitoring 
necessary to show that during the term of the permit the limit on the 
indicator parameter continues to attain and maintain applicable water 
quality standards; and
    (4) The permit contains a reopener clause allowing the permitting 
authority to modify or revoke and reissue the permit if the limits on 
the indicator parameter no longer attain and maintain applicable water 
quality standards.
    (vii) When developing water quality-based effluent limits under this 
paragraph the permitting authority shall ensure that:
    (A) The level of water quality to be achieved by limits on point 
sources established under this paragraph is derived from, and complies 
with all applicable water quality standards; and
    (B) Effluent limits developed to protect a narrative water quality 
criterion, a numeric water quality criterion, or both, are consistent 
with the assumptions and requirements of any available wasteload 
allocation for the

[[Page 443]]

discharge prepared by the State and approved by EPA pursuant to 40 CFR 
130.7.
    (2) Attain or maintain a specified water quality through water 
quality related effluent limits established under section 302 of CWA;
    (3) Conform to the conditions to a State certification under section 
401 of the CWA that meets the requirements of Sec. 124.53 when EPA is 
the permitting authority. If a State certification is stayed by a court 
of competent jurisdiction or an appropriate State board or agency, EPA 
shall notify the State that the Agency will deem certification waived 
unless a finally effective State certification is received within sixty 
days from the date of the notice. If the State does not forward a 
finally effective certification within the sixty day period, EPA shall 
include conditions in the permit that may be necessary to meet EPA's 
obligation under section 301(b)(1)(C) of the CWA;
    (4) Conform to applicable water quality requirements under section 
401(a)(2) of CWA when the discharge affects a State other than the 
certifying State;
    (5) Incorporate any more stringent limitations, treatment standards, 
or schedule of compliance requirements established under Federal or 
State law or regulations in accordance with section 301(b)(1)(C) of CWA;
    (6) Ensure consistency with the requirements of a Water Quality 
Management plan approved by EPA under section 208(b) of CWA;
    (7) Incorporate section 403(c) criteria under part 125, subpart M, 
for ocean discharges;
    (8) Incorporate alternative effluent limitations or standards where 
warranted by ``fundamentally different factors,'' under 40 CFR part 125, 
subpart D;
    (9) Incorporate any other appropriate requirements, conditions, or 
limitations (other than effluent limitations) into a new source permit 
to the extent allowed by the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 
U.S.C. 4321 et seq. and section 511 of the CWA, when EPA is the permit 
issuing authority. (See Sec. 122.29(c)).
    (e) Technology-based controls for toxic pollutants. Limitations 
established under paragraphs (a), (b), or (d) of this section, to 
control pollutants meeting the criteria listed in paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section. Limitations will be established in accordance with 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section. An explanation of the development of 
these limitations shall be included in the fact sheet under 
Sec. 124.56(b)(1)(i).
    (1) Limitations must control all toxic pollutants which the Director 
determines (based on information reported in a permit application under 
Sec. 122.21(g)(7) or (10) or in a notification under Sec. 122.42(a)(1) 
or on other information) are or may be discharged at a level greater 
than the level which can be achieved by the technology-based treatment 
requirements appropriate to the permittee under Sec. 125.3(c); or
    (2) The requirement that the limitations control the pollutants 
meeting the criteria of paragraph (e)(1) of this section will be 
satisfied by:
    (i) Limitations on those pollutants; or
    (ii) Limitations on other pollutants which, in the judgment of the 
Director, will provide treatment of the pollutants under paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section to the levels required by Sec. 125.3(c).
    (f) Notification level. A ``notification level'' which exceeds the 
notification level of Sec. 122.42(a)(1)(i), (ii) or (iii), upon a 
petition from the permittee or on the Director's initiative. This new 
notification level may not exceed the level which can be achieved by the 
technology-based treatment requirements appropriate to the permittee 
under Sec. 125.3(c)
    (g) Twenty-four hour reporting. Pollutants for which the permittee 
must report violations of maximum daily discharge limitations under 
Sec. 122.41(1)(6)(ii)(C) (24-hour reporting) shall be listed in the 
permit. This list shall include any toxic pollutant or hazardous 
substance, or any pollutant specifically identified as the method to 
control a toxic pollutant or hazardous substance.
    (h) Durations for permits, as set forth in Sec. 122.46.
    (i) Monitoring requirements. In addition to Sec. 122.48, the 
following monitoring requirements:
    (1) To assure compliance with permit limitations, requirements to 
monitor:

[[Page 444]]

    (i) The mass (or other measurement specified in the permit) for each 
pollutant limited in the permit;
    (ii) The volume of effluent discharged from each outfall;
    (iii) Other measurements as appropriate including pollutants in 
internal waste streams under Sec. 122.45(i); pollutants in intake water 
for net limitations under Sec. 122.45(f); frequency, rate of discharge, 
etc., for noncontinuous discharges under Sec. 122.45(e); pollutants 
subject to notification requirements under Sec. 122.42(a); and 
pollutants in sewage sludge or other monitoring as specified in 40 CFR 
part 503; or as determined to be necessary on a case-by-case basis 
pursuant to section 405(d)(4) of the CWA.
    (iv) According to test procedures approved under 40 CFR part 136 for 
the analyses of pollutants having approved methods under that part, and 
according to a test procedure specified in the permit for pollutants 
with no approved methods.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (i)(4) and (i)(5) of this 
section, requirements to report monitoring results shall be established 
on a case-by-case basis with a frequency dependent on the nature and 
effect of the discharge, but in no case less than once a year. For 
sewage sludge use or disposal practices, requirements to monitor and 
report results shall be established on a case-by-case basis with a 
frequency dependent on the nature and effect of the sewage sludge use or 
disposal practice; minimally this shall be as specified in 40 CFR part 
503 (where applicable), but in no case less than once a year.
    (3) Requirements to report monitoring results for storm water 
discharges associated with industrial activity which are subject to an 
effluent limitation guideline shall be established on a case-by-case 
basis with a frequency dependent on the nature and effect of the 
discharge, but in no case less than once a year.
    (4) Requirements to report monitoring results for storm water 
discharges associated with industrial activity (other than those 
addressed in paragraph (i)(3) of this section) shall be established on a 
case-by-case basis with a frequency dependent on the nature and effect 
of the discharge. At a minimum, a permit for such a discharge must 
require:
    (i) The discharger to conduct an annual inspection of the facility 
site to identify areas contributing to a storm water discharge 
associated with industrial activity and evaluate whether measures to 
reduce pollutant loadings identified in a storm water pollution 
prevention plan are adequate and properly implemented in accordance with 
the terms of the permit or whether additional control measures are 
needed;
    (ii) The discharger to maintain for a period of three years a record 
summarizing the results of the inspection and a certification that the 
facility is in compliance with the plan and the permit, and identifying 
any incidents of non-compliance;
    (iii) Such report and certification be signed in accordance with 
Sec. 122.22; and
    (iv) Permits for storm water discharges associated with industrial 
activity from inactive mining operations may, where annual inspections 
are impracticable, require certification once every three years by a 
Registered Professional Engineer that the facility is in compliance with 
the permit, or alternative requirements.
    (5) Permits which do not require the submittal of monitoring result 
reports at least annually shall require that the permittee report all 
instances of noncompliance not reported under Sec. 122.41(l) (1), (4), 
(5), and (6) at least annually.
    (j) Pretreatment program for POTWs. Requirements for POTWs to:
    (1) Identify, in terms of character and volume of pollutants, any 
significant indirect dischargers into the POTW subject to pretreatment 
standards under section 307(b) of CWA and 40 CFR part 403.
    (2) Submit a local program when required by and in accordance with 
40 CFR part 403 to assure compliance with pretreatment standards to the 
extent applicable under section 307(b). The local program shall be 
incorporated into the permit as described in 40 CFR part 403. The 
program shall require all indirect dischargers to the POTW to comply 
with the reporting requirements of 40 CFR part 403.

[[Page 445]]

    (3) For POTWs which are ``sludge-only facilities,'' a requirement to 
develop a pretreatment program under 40 CFR part 403 when the Director 
determines that a pretreatment program is necessary to assure compliance 
with Section 405(d) of the CWA.
    (k) Best management practices to control or abate the discharge of 
pollutants when:
    (1) Authorized under section 304(e) of CWA for the control of toxic 
pollutants and hazardous substances from ancillary industrial 
activities;
    (2) Numeric effluent limitations are infeasible, or
    (3) The practices are reasonably necessary to achieve effluent 
limitations and standards or to carry out the purposes and intent of 
CWA.
    (l) Reissued permits. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (l)(2) of 
this section when a permit is renewed or reissued, interim effluent 
limitations, standards or conditions must be at least as stringent as 
the final effluent limitations, standards, or conditions in the previous 
permit (unless the circumstances on which the previous permit was based 
have materially and substantially changed since the time the permit was 
issued and would constitute cause for permit modification or revocation 
and reissuance under Sec. 122.62.)
    (2) In the case of effluent limitations established on the basis of 
Section 402(a)(1)(B) of the CWA, a permit may not be renewed, reissued, 
or modified on the basis of effluent guidelines promulgated under 
section 304(b) subsequent to the original issuance of such permit, to 
contain effluent limitations which are less stringent than the 
comparable effluent limitations in the previous permit.
    (i) Exceptions--A permit with respect to which paragraph (l)(2) of 
this section applies may be renewed, reissued, or modified to contain a 
less stringent effluent limitation applicable to a pollutant, if--
    (A) Material and substantial alterations or additions to the 
permitted facility occurred after permit issuance which justify the 
application of a less stringent effluent limitation;
    (B)(1) Information is available which was not available at the time 
of permit issuance (other than revised regulations, guidance, or test 
methods) and which would have justified the application of a less 
stringent effluent limitation at the time of permit issuance; or
    (2) The Administrator determines that technical mistakes or mistaken 
interpretations of law were made in issuing the permit under section 
402(a)(1)(b);
    (C) A less stringent effluent limitation is necessary because of 
events over which the permittee has no control and for which there is no 
reasonably available remedy;
    (D) The permittee has received a permit modification under section 
301(c), 301(g), 301(h), 301(i), 301(k), 301(n), or 316(a); or
    (E) The permittee has installed the treatment facilities required to 
meet the effluent limitations in the previous permit and has properly 
operated and maintained the facilities but has nevertheless been unable 
to achieve the previous effluent limitations, in which case the 
limitations in the reviewed, reissued, or modified permit may reflect 
the level of pollutant control actually achieved (but shall not be less 
stringent than required by effluent guidelines in effect at the time of 
permit renewal, reissuance, or modification).
    (ii) Limitations. In no event may a permit with respect to which 
paragraph (l)(2) of this section applies be renewed, reissued, or 
modified to contain an effluent limitation which is less stringent than 
required by effluent guidelines in effect at the time the permit is 
renewed, reissued, or modified. In no event may such a permit to 
discharge into waters be renewed, issued, or modified to contain a less 
stringent effluent limitation if the implementation of such limitation 
would result in a violation of a water quality standard under section 
303 applicable to such waters.
    (m) Privately owned treatment works. For a privately owned treatment 
works, any conditions expressly applicable to any user, as a limited co-
permittee, that may be necessary in the permit issued to the treatment 
works to ensure compliance with applicable requirements under this part. 
Alternatively, the Director may issue separate permits to the treatment 
works

[[Page 446]]

and to its users, or may require a separate permit application from any 
user. The Director's decision to issue a permit with no conditions 
applicable to any user, to impose conditions on one or more users, to 
issue separate permits, or to require separate applications, and the 
basis for that decision, shall be stated in the fact sheet for the draft 
permit for the treatment works.
    (n) Grants. Any conditions imposed in grants made by the 
Administrator to POTWs under sections 201 and 204 of CWA which are 
reasonably necessary for the achievement of effluent limitations under 
section 301 of CWA.
    (o) Sewage sludge. Requirements under section 405 of CWA governing 
the disposal of sewage sludge from publicly owned treatment works or any 
other treatment works treating domestic sewage for any use for which 
regulations have been established, in accordance with any applicable 
regulations.
    (p) Coast Guard. When a permit is issued to a facility that may 
operate at certain times as a means of transportation over water, a 
condition that the discharge shall comply with any applicable 
regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the department in which the 
Coast Guard is operating, that establish specifications for safe 
transportation, handling, carriage, and storage of pollutants.
    (q) Navigation. Any conditions that the Secretary of the Army 
considers necessary to ensure that navigation and anchorage will not be 
substantially impaired, in accordance with Sec. 124.58.
    (r) Great Lakes. When a permit is issued to a facility that 
discharges into the Great Lakes System (as defined in 40 CFR 132.2), 
conditions promulgated by the State, Tribe, or EPA pursuant to 40 CFR 
part 132.

<R05>
Sec. 122.45  Calculating NPDES permit conditions (applicable to State NPDES programs, see Sec. 123.25).

    (a) Outfalls and discharge points. All permit effluent limitations, 
standards and prohibitions shall be established for each outfall or 
discharge point of the permitted facility, except as otherwise provided 
under Sec. 122.44(k) (BMPs where limitations are infeasible) and 
paragraph (i) of this section (limitations on internal waste streams).
    (b) Production-based limitations. (1) In the case of POTWs, permit 
effluent limitations, standards, or prohibitions shall be calculated 
based on design flow.
    (2)(i) Except in the case of POTWs or as provided in paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii) of this section, calculation of any permit limitations, 
standards, or prohibitions which are based on production (or other 
measure of operation) shall be based not upon the designed production 
capacity but rather upon a reasonable measure of actual production of 
the facility. For new sources or new dischargers, actual production 
shall be estimated using projected production. The time period of the 
measure of production shall correspond to the time period of the 
calculated permit limitations; for example, monthly production shall be 
used to calculate average monthly discharge limitations.
    (ii)(A)(1) The Director may include a condition establishing 
alternate permit limitations, standards, or prohibitions based upon 
anticipated increased (not to exceed maximum production capability) or 
decreased production levels.
    (2) For the automotive manufacturing industry only, the Regional 
Administrator shall, and the State Director may establish a condition 
under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A)(1) of this section if the applicant 
satisfactorily demonstrates to the Director at the time the application 
is submitted that its actual production, as indicated in paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of this section, is substantially below maximum production 
capability and that there is a reasonable potential for an increase 
above actual production during the duration of the permit.
    (B) If the Director establishes permit conditions under paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section:
    (1) The permit shall require the permittee to notify the Director at 
least two business days prior to a month in which the permittee expects 
to operate at a level higher than the lowest production level identified 
in the permit.

[[Page 447]]

The notice shall specify the anticipated level and the period during 
which the permittee expects to operate at the alternate level. If the 
notice covers more than one month, the notice shall specify the reasons 
for the anticipated production level increase. New notice of discharge 
at alternate levels is required to cover a period or production level 
not covered by prior notice or, if during two consecutive months 
otherwise covered by a notice, the production level at the permitted 
facility does not in fact meet the higher level designated in the 
notice.
    (2) The permittee shall comply with the limitations, standards, or 
prohibitions that correspond to the lowest level of production specified 
in the permit, unless the permittee has notified the Director under 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B)(1) of this section, in which case the permittee 
shall comply with the lower of the actual level of production during 
each month or the level specified in the notice.
    (3) The permittee shall submit with the DMR the level of production 
that actually occurred during each month and the limitations, standards, 
or prohibitions applicable to that level of production.
    (c) Metals. All permit effluent limitations, standards, or 
prohibitions for a metal shall be expressed in terms of ``total 
recoverable metal'' as defined in 40 CFR part 136 unless:
    (1) An applicable effluent standard or limitation has been 
promulgated under the CWA and specifies the limitation for the metal in 
the dissolved or valent or total form; or
    (2) In establishing permit limitations on a case-by-case basis under 
Sec. 125.3, it is necessary to express the limitation on the metal in 
the dissolved or valent or total form to carry out the provisions of the 
CWA; or
    (3) All approved analytical methods for the metal inherently measure 
only its dissolved form (e.g., hexavalent chromium).
    (d) Continuous discharges. For continuous discharges all permit 
effluent limitations, standards, and prohibitions, including those 
necessary to achieve water quality standards, shall unless impracticable 
be stated as:
    (1) Maximum daily and average monthly discharge limitations for all 
dischargers other than publicly owned treatment works; and
    (2) Average weekly and average monthly discharge limitations for 
POTWs.
    (e) Non-continuous discharges. Discharges which are not continuous, 
as defined in Sec. 122.2, shall be particularly described and limited, 
considering the following factors, as appropriate:
    (1) Frequency (for example, a batch discharge shall not occur more 
than once every 3 weeks);
    (2) Total mass (for example, not to exceed 100 kilograms of zinc and 
200 kilograms of chromium per batch discharge);
    (3) Maximum rate of discharge of pollutants during the discharge 
(for example, not to exceed 2 kilograms of zinc per minute); and
    (4) Prohibition or limitation of specified pollutants by mass, 
concentration, or other appropriate measure (for example, shall not 
contain at any time more than 0.1 mg/1 zinc or more than 250 grams (\1/
4\ kilogram) of zinc in any discharge).
    (f) Mass limitations. (1) All pollutants limited in permits shall 
have limitations, standards or prohibitions expressed in terms of mass 
except:
    (i) For pH, temperature, radiation, or other pollutants which cannot 
appropriately be expressed by mass;
    (ii) When applicable standards and limitations are expressed in 
terms of other units of measurement; or
    (iii) If in establishing permit limitations on a case-by-case basis 
under Sec. 125.3, limitations expressed in terms of mass are infeasible 
because the mass of the pollutant discharged cannot be related to a 
measure of operation (for example, discharges of TSS from certain mining 
operations), and permit conditions ensure that dilution will not be used 
as a substitute for treatment.
    (2) Pollutants limited in terms of mass additionally may be limited 
in terms of other units of measurement, and the permit shall require the 
permittee to comply with both limitations.
    (g) Pollutants in intake water. (1) Upon request of the discharger, 
technology-based effluent limitations or standards

[[Page 448]]

shall be adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the discharger's 
intake water if:
    (i) The applicable effluent limitations and standards contained in 
40 CFR subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be applied on a 
net basis; or
    (ii) The discharger demonstrates that the control system it proposes 
or uses to meet applicable technology-based limitations and standards 
would, if properly installed and operated, meet the limitations and 
standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters.
    (2) Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand 
(BOD) or total suspended solids (TSS) should not be granted unless the 
permittee demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in 
the effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the 
generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional 
limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or 
elsewhere.
    (3) Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the 
applicable limitation or standard, up to a maximum value equal to the 
influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine 
eligibility for credits and compliance with permit limits.
    (4) Credit shall be granted only if the discharger demonstrates that 
the intake water is drawn from the same body of water into which the 
discharge is made. The Director may waive this requirement if he finds 
that no environmental degradation will result.
    (5) This section does not apply to the discharge of raw water 
clarifier sludge generated from the treatment of intake water.
    (h) Internal waste streams. (1) When permit effluent limitations or 
standards imposed at the point of discharge are impractical or 
infeasible, effluent limitations or standards for discharges of 
pollutants may be imposed on internal waste streams before mixing with 
other waste streams or cooling water streams. In those instances, the 
monitoring required by Sec. 122.44(i) shall also be applied to the 
internal waste streams.
    (2) Limits on internal waste streams will be imposed only when the 
fact sheet under Sec. 124.56 sets forth the exceptional circumstances 
which make such limitations necessary, such as when the final discharge 
point is inaccessible (for example, under 10 meters of water), the 
wastes at the point of discharge are so diluted as to make monitoring 
impracticable, or the interferences among pollutants at the point of 
discharge would make detection or analysis impracticable.
    (i) Disposal of pollutants into wells, into POTWs or by land 
application. Permit limitations and standards shall be calculated as 
provided in Sec. 122.50.

Sec. 122.46  Duration of permits (applicable to State programs, see Sec. 123.25).

    (a) NPDES permits shall be effective for a fixed term not to exceed 
5 years.
    (b) Except as provided in Sec. 122.6, the term of a permit shall not 
be extended by modification beyond the maximum duration specified in 
this section.
    (c) The Director may issue any permit for a duration that is less 
than the full allowable term under this section.
    (d) A permit may be issued to expire on or after the statutory 
deadline set forth in section 301(b)(2) (A), (C), and (E), if the permit 
includes effluent limitations to meet the requirements of section 
301(b)(2) (A), (C), (D), (E) and (F), whether or not applicable effluent 
limitations guidelines have been promulgated or approved.
    (e) A determination that a particular discharger falls within a 
given industrial category for purposes of setting a permit expiration 
date under paragraph (d) of this section is not conclusive as to the 
discharger's inclusion in that industrial category for any other 
purposes, and does not prejudice any rights to challenge or change that 
inclusion at the time that a permit based on that determination is 
formulated.

<R05>
Sec. 122.47  Schedules of compliance.

    (a) General (applicable to State programs, see Sec. 123.25). The 
permit may, when appropriate, specify a schedule of compliance leading 
to compliance with CWA and regulations.
    (1) Time for compliance. Any schedules of compliance under this 
section shall require compliance as soon as possible, but not later than 
the applicable statutory deadline under the CWA.
    (2) The first NPDES permit issued to a new source or a new 
discharger shall contain a schedule of compliance only when necessary to 
allow a reasonable opportunity to attain compliance with requirements 
issued or revised after commencement of construction but less than three 
years before commencement of the relevant discharge. For recommencing 
dischargers, a schedule of compliance shall be available only when 
necessary to allow a reasonable opportunity to attain compliance with 
requirements issued or revised less than three years before 
recommencement of discharge.
    (3) Interim dates. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of 
this section, if a permit establishes a schedule of compliance which 
exceeds 1 year from the date of permit issuance, the schedule shall set 
forth interim requirements and the dates for their achievement.
    (i) The time between interim dates shall not exceed 1 year, except 
that in the case of a schedule for compliance with standards for sewage 
sludge use and disposal, the time between interim dates shall not exceed 
six months.
    (ii) If the time necessary for completion of any interim requirement 
(such as the construction of a control facility) is more than 1 year and 
is not readily divisible into stages for completion, the permit shall 
specify interim dates for the submission of reports of progress toward 
completion of the interim requirements and indicate a projected 
completion date.

    Note: Examples of interim requirements include: (a) Submit a 
complete Step 1 construction grant (for POTWs); (b) let a contract for 
construction of required facilities; (c) commence construction of 
required facilities; (d) complete construction of required facilities.

    (4) Reporting. The permit shall be written to require that no later 
than 14 days following each interim date and the final date of 
compliance, the permittee shall notify the Director in writing of its 
compliance or noncompliance with the interim or final requirements, or 
submit progress reports if paragraph (a)(3)(ii) is applicable.
    (b) Alternative schedules of compliance. An NPDES permit applicant 
or permittee may cease conducting regulated activities (by terminating 
of direct discharge for NPDES sources) rather than continuing to operate 
and meet permit requriements as follows:
    (1) If the permittee decides to cease conducting regulated 
activities at a given time within the term of a permit which has already 
been issued:
    (i) The permit may be modified to contain a new or additional 
schedule leading to timely cessation of activities; or
    (ii) The permittee shall cease conducting permitted activities 
before non-compliance with any interim or final compliance schedule 
requirement already specified in the permit.
    (2) If the decision to cease conducting regulated activities is made 
before issuance of a permit whose term will include the termination 
date, the permit shall contain a schedule leading to termination which 
will ensure timely compliance with applicable requirements no later than 
the statutory deadline.
    (3) If the permittee is undecided whether to cease conducting 
regulated activities, the Director may issue or modify a permit to 
contain two schedules as follows:
    (i) Both schedules shall contain an identical interim deadline 
requiring a final decision on whether to cease conducting regulated 
activities no later than a date which ensures sufficient time to comply 
with applicable requirements in a timely manner if the decision is to 
continue conducting regulated activities;
    (ii) One schedule shall lead to timely compliance with applicable 
requirements, no later than the statutory deadline;
    (iii) The second schedule shall lead to cessation of regulated 
activities by a

[[Page 450]]

date which will ensure timely compliance with applicable requirements no 
later than the statutory deadline.
    (iv) Each permit containing two schedules shall include a 
requirement that after the permittee has made a final decision under 
paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section it shall follow the schedule leading 
to compliance if the decision is to continue conducting regulated 
activities, and follow the schedule leading to termination if the 
decision is to cease conducting regulated activities.
    (4) The applicant's or permittee's decision to cease conducting 
regulated activities shall be evidenced by a firm public commitment 
satisfactory to the Director, such as a resolution of the board of 
directors of a corporation.

<R05>
Sec. 122.48  Requirements for recording and reporting of monitoring results (applicable to State programs, see Sec. 123.25).

    All permits shall specify:
    (a) Requirements concerning the proper use, maintenance, and 
installation, when appropriate, of monitoring equipment or methods 
(including biological monitoring methods when appropriate);
    (b) Required monitoring including type, intervals, and frequency 
sufficient to yield data which are representative of the monitored 
activity including, when appropriate, continuous monitoring;
    (c) Applicable reporting requirements based upon the impact of the 
regulated activity and as specified in Sec. 122.44. Reporting shall be 
no less frequent than specified in the above regulation.

Sec. 122.49  Considerations under Federal law.

    The following is a list of Federal laws that may apply to the 
issuance of permits under these rules. When any of these laws is 
applicable, its procedures must be followed. When the applicable law 
requires consideration or adoption of particular permit conditions or 
requires the denial of a permit, those requirements also must be 
followed.
    (a) The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 16 U.S.C. 1273 et seq. section 7 
of the Act prohibits the Regional Administrator from assisting by 
license or otherwise the construction of any water resources project 
that would have a direct, adverse effect on the values for which a 
national wild and scenic river was established.
    (b) The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, 16 U.S.C. 470 et 
seq. section 106 of the Act and implementing regulations (36 CFR part 
800) require the Regional Administrator, before issuing a license, to 
adopt measures when feasible to mitigate potential adverse effects of 
the licensed activity and properties listed or eligible for listing in 
the National Register of Historic Places. The Act's requirements are to 
be implemented in cooperation with State Historic Preservation Officers 
and upon notice to, and when appropriate, in consultation with the 
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.
    (c) The Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. section 7 of 
the Act and implementing regulations (50 CFR part 402) require the 
Regional Administrator to ensure, in consultation with the Secretary of 
the Interior or Commerce, that any action authorized by EPA is not 
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or 
threatened species or adversely affect its critical habitat.
    (d) The Coastal Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C. 1451 et seq. section 
307(c) of the Act and implementing regulations (15 CFR part 930) 
prohibit EPA from issuing a permit for an activity affecting land or 
water use in the coastal zone until the applicant certifies that the 
proposed activity complies with the State Coastal Zone Management 
program, and the State or its designated agency concurs with the 
certification (or the Secretary of Commerce overrides the State's 
nonconcurrence).
    (e) The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, 16 U.S.C. 661 et seq., 
requires that the Regional Administrator, before issuing a permit 
proposing or authorizing the impoundment (with certain exemptions), 
diversion, or other control or modification of any body of water, 
consult with the appropriate State

[[Page 451]]

agency exercising jurisdiction over wildlife resources to conserve those 
resources.
    (f) Executive orders. [Reserved]
    (g) The National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., 
may require preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement and 
consideration of EIS-related permit conditions (other than effluent 
limitations) as provided in Sec. 122.29(c).

(Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), Safe Drinking Water Act (42 
U.S.C. 300f et seq.), Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), Resource

<R05>
Sec. 122.50  Disposal of pollutants into wells, into publicly owned treatment works or by land application (applicable to State NPDES programs, see 
          Sec. 123.25).

    (a) When part of a discharger's process wastewater is not being 
discharged into waters of the United States or contiguous zone because 
it is disposed into a well, into a POTW, or by land application thereby 
reducing the flow or level of pollutants being discharged into waters of 
the United States, applicable effluent standards and limitations for the 
discharge in an NPDES permit shall be adjusted to reflect the reduced 
raw waste resulting from such disposal. Effluent limitations and 
standards in the permit shall be calculated by one of the following 
methods:
    (1) If none of the waste from a particular process is discharged 
into waters of the United States, and effluent limitations guidelines 
provide separate allocation for wastes from that process, all 
allocations for the process shall be eliminated from calculation of 
permit effluent limitations or standards.
    (2) In all cases other than those described in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, effluent limitations shall be adjusted by multiplying the 
effluent limitation derived by applying effluent limitation guidelines 
to the total waste stream by the amount of wastewater flow to be treated 
and discharged into waters of the United States, and dividing the result 
by the total wastewater flow. Effluent limitations and standards so 
calculated may be further adjusted under part 125, subpart D to make 
them more or less stringent if discharges to wells, publicly owned 
treatment works, or by land application change the character or 
treatability of the pollutants being discharged to receiving waters. 
This method may be algebraically expressed as:

                                                                        
                                             E x N                      
                                    P=   ------------                   
                                               T                        
                                                                        

where P is the permit effluent limitation, E is the limitation derived 
by applying effluent guidelines to the total wastestream, N is the 
wastewater flow to be treated and discharged to waters of the United 
States, and T is the total wastewater flow.
    (b) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to the extent that 
promulgated effluent limitations guidelines:
    (1) Control concentrations of pollutants discharged but not mass; or
    (2) Specify a different specific technique for adjusting effluent 
limitations to account for well injection, land application, or disposal 
into POTWs.
    (c) Paragraph (a) of this section does not alter a discharger's 
obligation to meet any more stringent requirements established under 
Secs. 122.41, 122.42, 122.43, and 122.44.

   Subpart D--Transfer, Modification, Revocation and Reissuance, and 
                         Termination of Permits


<R05>
Sec. 122.61  Transfer of permits (applicable to State programs, see Sec. 123.25).

    (a) Transfers by modification. Except as provided in paragraph (b) 
of this section, a permit may be transferred by the permittee to a new 
owner or operator only if the permit has been modified or revoked and 
reissued (under Sec. 122.62(b)(2)), or a minor modification made (under 
Sec. 122.63(d)), to identify the new permittee and incorporate such 
other requirements as may be necessary under CWA.
    (b) Automatic transfers. As an alternative to transfers under 
paragraph (a) of this section, any NPDES permit may

[[Page 452]]

be automatically transferred to a new permittee if:
    (1) The current permittee notifies the Director at least 30 days in 
advance of the proposed transfer date in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section;
    (2) The notice includes a written agreement between the existing and 
new permittees containing a specific date for transfer of permit 
responsibility, coverage, and liability between them; and
    (3) The Director does not notify the existing permittee and the 
proposed new permittee of his or her intent to modify or revoke and 
reissue the permit. A modification under this subparagraph may also be a 
minor modification under Sec. 122.63. If this notice is not received, 
the transfer is effective on the date specified in the agreement 
mentioned in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 122.62  Modification or revocation and reissuance of permits (applicable to State programs, see Sec. 123.25).

    When the Director receives any information (for example, inspects 
the facility, receives information submitted by the permittee as 
required in the permit (see Sec. 122.41), receives a request for 
modification or revocation and reissuance under Sec. 124.5, or conducts 
a review of the permit file) he or she may determine whether or not one 
or more of the causes listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
for modification or revocation and reissuance or both exist. If cause 
exists, the Director may modify or revoke and reissue the permit 
accordingly, subject to the limitations of Sec. 124.5(c), and may 
request an updated application if necessary. When a permit is modified, 
only the conditions subject to modification are reopened. If a permit is 
revoked and reissued, the entire permit is reopened and subject to 
revision and the permit is reissued for a new term. See 
Sec. 124.5(c)(2). If cause does not exist under this section or 
Sec. 122.63, the Director shall not modify or revoke and reissue the 
permit. If a permit modification satisfies the criteria in Sec. 122.63 
for ``minor modifications'' the permit may be modified without a draft 
permit or public review. Otherwise, a draft permit must be prepared and 
other procedures in part 124 (or procedures of an approved State 
program) followed.
    (a) Causes for modification. The following are causes for 
modification but not revocation and reissuance of permits except when 
the permittee requests or agrees.
    (1) Alterations. There are material and substantial alterations or 
additions to the permitted facility or activity (including a change or 
changes in the permittee's sludge use or disposal practice) which 
occurred after permit issuance which justify the application of permit 
conditions that are different or absent in the existing permit.

    Note: Certain reconstruction activities may cause the new source 
provisions of Sec. 122.29 to be applicable.

    (2) Information. The Director has received new information. Permits 
may be modified during their terms for this cause only if the 
information was not available at the time of permit issuance (other than 
revised regulations, guidance, or test methods) and would have justified 
the application of different permit conditions at the time of issuance. 
For NPDES general permits (Sec. 122.28) this cause includes any 
information indicating that cumulative effects on the environment are 
unacceptable. For new source or new discharger NPDES permits 
Secs. 122.21, 122.29), this cause shall include any significant 
information derived from effluent testing required under 
Sec. 122.21(k)(5)(vi) or Sec. 122.21(h)(4)(iii) after issuance of the 
permit.
    (3) New regulations. The standards or regulations on which the 
permit was based have been changed by promulgation of amended standards 
or regulations or by judicial decision after the permit was issued. 
Permits may be modified during their terms for this cause only as 
follows:
    (i) For promulgation of amended standards or regulations, when:
    (A) The permit condition requested to be modified was based on a 
promulgated effluent limitation guideline, EPA approved or promulgated 
water quality standards, or the Secondary Treatment Regulations under 
part 133; and
    (B) EPA has revised, withdrawn, or modified that portion of the 
regulation or effluent limitation guideline on

[[Page 453]]

which the permit condition was based, or has approved a State action 
with regard to a water quality standard on which the permit condition 
was based; and
    (C) A permittee requests modification in accordance with Sec. 124.5 
within ninety (90) days after Federal Register notice of the action on 
which the request is based.
    (ii) For judicial decisions, a court of competent jurisdiction has 
remanded and stayed EPA promulgated regulations or effluent limitation 
guidelines, if the remand and stay concern that portion of the 
regulations or guidelines on which the permit condition was based and a 
request is filed by the permittee in accordance with Sec. 124.5 within 
ninety (90) days of judicial remand.
    (iii) For changes based upon modified State certifications of NPDES 
permits, see Sec. 124.55(b).
    (4) Compliance schedules. The Director determines good cause exists 
for modification of a compliance schedule, such as an act of God, 
strike, flood, or materials shortage or other events over which the 
permittee has little or no control and for which there is no reasonably 
available remedy. However, in no case may an NPDES compliance schedule 
be modified to extend beyond an applicable CWA statutory deadline. See 
also Sec. 122.63(c) (minor modifications) and paragraph (a)(14) of this 
section (NPDES innovative technology).
    (5) When the permittee has filed a request for a variance under CWA 
section 301(c), 301(g), 301(h), 301(i), 301(k), or 316(a) or for 
``fundamentally different factors'' within the time specified in 
Sec. 122.21 or Sec. 125.27(a).
    (6) 307(a) toxics. When required to incorporate an applicable 307(a) 
toxic effluent standard or prohibition (see Sec. 122.44(b)).
    (7) Reopener. When required by the ``reopener'' conditions in a 
permit, which are established in the permit under Sec. 122.44(b) (for 
CWA toxic effluent limitations and standards for sewage sludge use or 
disposal, see also Sec. 122.44(c)) or 40 CFR Sec. 403.10(e) 
(pretreatment program).
    (8)(i) Net limits. Upon request of a permittee who qualifies for 
effluent limitations on a net basis under Sec. 122.45(h).
    (ii) When a discharger is no longer eligible for net limitations, as 
provided in Sec. 122.45(h)(1)(ii)(B).
    (9) Pretreatment. As necessary under 40 CFR 403.8(e) (compliance 
schedule for development of pretreatment program).
    (10) Failure to notify. Upon failure of an approved State to notify, 
as required by section 402(b)(3), another State whose waters may be 
affected by a discharge from the approved State.
    (11) Non-limited pollutants. When the level of discharge of any 
pollutant which is not limited in the permit exceeds the level which can 
be achieved by the technology-based treatment requirements appropriate 
to the permittee under Sec. 125.3(c).
    (12) Notification levels. To establish a ``notification level'' as 
provided in Sec. 122.44(f).
    (13) Compliance schedules. To modify a schedule of compliance to 
reflect the time lost during construction of an innovative or 
alternative facility, in the case of a POTW which has received a grant 
under section 202(a)(3) of CWA for 100% of the costs to modify or 
replace facilities constructed with a grant for innovative and 
alternative wastewater technology under section 202(a)(2). In no case 
shall the compliance schedule be modified to extend beyond an applicable 
CWA statutory deadline for compliance.
    (14) [Reserved]
    (15) To correct technical mistakes, such as errors in calculation, 
or mistaken interpretations of law made in determining permit 
conditions.
    (16) When the discharger has installed the treatment technology 
considered by the permit writer in setting effluent limitations imposed 
under section 402(a)(1) of the CWA and has properly operated and 
maintained the facilities but nevertheless has been unable to achieve 
those effluent limitations. In this case, the limitations in the 
modified permit may reflect the level of pollutant control actually 
achieved (but shall not be less stringent than required by a 
subsequently promulgated effluent limitations guideline).
    (17) [Reserved]

[[Page 454]]

    (18) Land application plans. When required by a permit condition to 
incorporate a land application plan for beneficial reuse of sewage 
sludge, to revise an existing land application plan, or to add a land 
application plan.
    (b) Causes for modification or revocation and reissuance. The 
following are causes to modify or, alternatively, revoke and reissue a 
permit:
    (1) Cause exists for termination under Sec. 122.64, and the Director 
determines that modification or revocation and reissuance is 
appropriate.
    (2) The Director has received notification (as required in the 
permit, see Sec. 122.41(l)(3)) of a proposed transfer of the permit. A 
permit also may be modified to reflect a transfer after the effective 
date of an automatic transfer (Sec. 122.61(b)) but will not be revoked 
and reissued after the effective date of the transfer except upon the 
request of the new permittee.

Sec. 122.63  Minor modifications of permits.

    Upon the consent of the permittee, the Director may modify a permit 
to make the corrections or allowances for changes in the permitted 
activity listed in this section, without following the procedures of 
part 124. Any permit modification not processed as a minor modification 
under this section must be made for cause and with part 124 draft permit 
and public notice as required in Sec. 122.62. Minor modifications may 
only:
    (a) Correct typographical errors;
    (b) Require more frequent monitoring or reporting by the permittee;
    (c) Change an interim compliance date in a schedule of compliance, 
provided the new date is not more than 120 days after the date specified 
in the existing permit and does not interfere with attainment of the 
final compliance date requirement; or
    (d) Allow for a change in ownership or operational control of a 
facility where the Director determines that no other change in the 
permit is necessary, provided that a written agreement containing a 
specific date for transfer of permit responsibility, coverage, and 
liability between the current and new permittees has been submitted to 
the Director.
    (e)(1) Change the construction schedule for a discharger which is a 
new source. No such change shall affect a discharger's obligation to 
have all pollution control equipment installed and in operation prior to 
discharge under Sec. 122.29.
    (2) Delete a point source outfall when the discharge from that 
outfall is terminated and does not result in discharge of pollutants 
from other outfalls except in accordance with permit limits.
    (f) [Reserved]
    (g) Incorporate conditions of a POTW pretreatment program that has 
been approved in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.11 (or a 
modification thereto that has been approved in accordance with the

    (a) The following are causes for terminating a permit during its 
term, or for denying a permit renewal application:
    (1) Noncompliance by the permittee with any condition of the permit;
    (2) The permittee's failure in the application or during the permit 
issuance process to disclose fully all relevant facts, or the 
permittee's misrepresentation of any relevant facts at any time;
    (3) A determination that the permitted activity endangers human 
health or the environment and can only be regulated to acceptable levels 
by permit modification or termination; or
    (4) A change in any condition that requires either a temporary or 
permanent reduction or elimination of any discharge or sludge use or 
disposal practice controlled by the permit (for

 Appendix B to Part 122--Criteria for Determining a Concentrated Animal 
                     Feeding Operation (Sec. 122.23)

    An animal feeding operation is a concentrated animal feeding 
operation for purposes of Sec. 122.23 if either of the following 
criteria are met.
    (a) More than the numbers of animals specified in any of the 
following categories are confined:
    (1) 1,000 slaughter and feeder cattle,
    (2) 700 mature dairy cattle (whether milked or dry cows),
    (3) 2,500 swine each weighing over 25 kilograms (approximately 55 
pounds),
    (4) 500 horses,
    (5) 10,000 sheep or lambs,
    (6) 55,000 turkeys,
    (7) 100,000 laying hens or broilers (if the facility has continuous 
overflow watering),
    (8) 30,000 laying hens or broilers (if the facility has a liquid 
manure system),
    (9) 5,000 ducks, or
    (10) 1,000 animal units; or
    (b) More than the following number and types of animals are 
confined:
    (1) 300 slaughter or feeder cattle,
    (2) 200 mature dairy cattle (whether milked or dry cows),
    (3) 750 swine each weighing over 25 kilograms (approximately 55 
pounds),
    (4) 150 horses,
    (5) 3,000 sheep or lambs,
    (6) 16,500 turkeys,
    (7) 30,000 laying hens or broilers (if the facility has continuous 
overflow watering),
    (8) 9,000 laying hens or broilers (if the facility has a liquid 
manure handling system),
    (9) 1,500 ducks, or
    (10) 300 animal units;

and either one of the following conditions are met: pollutants are 
discharged into navigable waters through a manmade ditch, flushing 
system or other similar man-made device; or pollutants are discharged 
directly into waters of the United States which originate outside of and 
pass over, across, or through the facility or otherwise come into direct 
contact with the animals confined in the operation.
    Provided, however, that no animal feeding operation is a 
concentrated animal feeding operation as defined above if such animal 
feeding operation discharges only in the event of a 25 year, 24-hour 
storm event.
    The term animal unit means a unit of measurement for any animal 
feeding operation calculated by adding the following numbers: the number 
of slaughter and feeder cattle multiplied by 1.0, plus the number of 
mature dairy cattle multiplied by 1.4, plus the number of swine weighing 
over 25 kilograms (approximately 55 pounds) multiplied by 0.4, plus the 
number of sheep multiplied by 0.1, plus the number of horses multiplied 
by 2.0.
    The term manmade means constructed by man and used for the purpose 
of transporting wastes.

Appendix C to Part 122--Criteria for Determining a Concentrated Aquatic 
                Animal Production Facility (Sec. 122.24)

    A hatchery, fish farm, or other facility is a concentrated aquatic 
animal production facility for purposes of Sec. 122.24 if it contains, 
grows, or holds aquatic animals in either of the following categories:
    (a) Cold water fish species or other cold water aquatic animals in 
ponds, raceways, or other similar structures which discharge at least 30 
days per year but does not include:
    (1) Facilities which produce less than 9,090 harvest weight 
kilograms (approximately 20,000 pounds) of aquatic animals per year; and
    (2) Facilities which feed less than 2,272 kilograms (approximately 
5,000 pounds) of food during the calendar month of maximum feeding.
    (b) Warm water fish species or other warm water aquatic animals in 
ponds, raceways, or other similar structures which discharge at least 30 
days per year, but does not include:
    (1) Closed ponds which discharge only during periods of excess 
runoff; or
    (2) Facilities which produce less than 45,454 harvest weight 
kilograms (approximately 100,000 pounds) of aquatic animals per year.
    ``Cold water aquatic animals'' include, but are not limited to, the 
Salmonidae family of fish; e.g., trout and salmon.
    ``Warm water aquatic animals'' include, but are not limited to, the 
Ameiuride, Centrarchidae and Cyprinidae families of fish; e.g., 
respectively, catfish, sunfish and minnows.

                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 123.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This part specifies the procedures EPA will follow in approving, 
revising, and withdrawing State programs and the requirements State 
programs must meet to be approved by the Administrator under sections 
318, 402, and 405 (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System--
NPDES) of CWA.
    (b) These regulations are promulgated under the authority of 
sections 304(i), 101(e), 405, and 518(e) of the CWA, and implement the 
requirements of those sections.
    (c) The Administrator shall approve State programs which conform to 
the applicable requirements of this part. A State NPDES program will not 
be approved by the Administrator under section 402 of CWA unless it has 
authority to control the discharges specified in sections 318 and 405(a) 
of CWA. Permit programs under sections 318 and 405(a) will not be 
approved independent of a section 402 program. (Permit programs under 
section 405(f) of CWA (sludge management programs) may be approved under 
40 CFR part 501 independently of a section 402 permit program.)
    (d)(1) Upon approval of a State program, the Administrator shall 
suspend the issuance of Federal permits for those activities subject to 
the approved State program. After program approval EPA shall retain 
jurisdiction over any permits (including general permits) which it has 
issued unless arrangements have been made with the State in the 
Memorandum of Agreement for the State to assume responsibility for these 
permits. Retention of jurisdiction shall include the processing of any 
permit appeals, modification requests, or variance requests; the conduct 
of inspections, and the receipt and review of self-monitoring reports. 
If any permit appeal, modification request or variance request is not 
finally resolved when the federally issued permit expires, EPA may, with 
the consent of the State, retain jurisdiction until the matter is 
resolved.
    (2) The procedures outlined in the preceding paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section for suspension of permitting authority and transfer of 
existing permits will also apply when EPA approves an Indian Tribe's 
application to operate a State program and a State was the authorized 
permitting authority under Sec. 123.23(b) for activities within the 
scope of the newly approved program. The authorized State will retain 
jurisdiction over its existing permits as described in paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section absent a different arrangement

[[Page 464]]

stated in the Memorandum of Agreement executed between EPA and the 
Tribe.
    (e) Upon submission of a complete program, EPA will conduct a public 
hearing, if interest is shown, and determine whether to approve or 
disapprove the program taking into consideration the requirements of 
this part, the CWA and any comments received.
    (f) Any State program approved by the Administrator shall at all 
times be conducted in accordance with the requirements of this part.
    (g)(1) Except as may be authorized pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of 
this section or excluded by Sec. 122.3, the State program must prohibit 
all point source discharges of pollutants, all discharges into 
aquaculture projects, and all disposal of sewage sludge which results in 
any pollutant from such sludge entering into any waters of the United 
States within the State's jurisdiction except as authorized by a permit 
in effect under the State program or under section 402 of CWA. NPDES 
authority may be shared by two or more State agencies but each agency 
must have Statewide jurisdiction over a class of activities or 
discharges. When more than one agency is responsible for issuing 
permits, each agency must make a submission meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 123.21 before EPA will begin formal review.
    (2) A State may seek approval of a partial or phased program in 
accordance with section 402(n) of the CWA.
    (h) In many cases, States (other than Indian Tribes) will lack 
authority to regulate activities on Indian lands. This lack of authority 
does not impair that State's ability to obtain full program approval in 
accordance with this part, i.e., inability of a State to regulate 
activities on Indian lands does not constitute a partial program. EPA 
will administer the program on Indian lands if a State (or Indian Tribe) 
does not seek or have authority to regulate activities on Indian lands.

    Note: States are advised to contact the United States Department of 
the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, concerning authority over Indian 
lands.

    (i) Nothing in this part precludes a State from:
    (1) Adopting or enforcing requirements which are more stringent or 
more extensive than those required under this part;
    (2) Operating a program with a greater scope of coverage than that 
required under this part. If an approved State program has greater scope 
of coverage than required by Federal law the additional coverage is not 
part of the Federally approved program.

    Note: For example, if a State requires permits for discharges into 
publicly owned treatment works, these permits are not NPDES permits.

<R05>
Sec. 123.2  Definitions.

    The definitions in part 122 and part 501 apply to all subparts of 
this part.

[54 FR 18784, May 2, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 123.3  Coordination with other programs.

    Issuance of State permits under this part may be coordinated with 
issuance of RCRA, UIC, NPDES, and 404 permits whether they are 
controlled by the State, EPA, or the Corps of Engineers. See Sec. 124.4.


<R04>
                  Subpart B--State Program Submissions


<R05>
Sec. 123.21  Elements of a program submission.

    (a) Any State that seeks to administer a program under this part 
shall submit to the Administrator at least three copies of a program 
submission. The submission shall contain the following:
    (1) A letter from the Governor of the State (or in the case of an 
Indian Tribe in accordance with Sec. 123.33(b), the Tribal authority 
exercising powers substantially similar to those of a State Governor) 
requesting program approval;
    (2) A complete program description, as required by Sec. 123.22, 
describing how the State intends to carry out its responsibilities under 
this part;
    (3) An Attorney General's statement as required by Sec. 123.23;

[[Page 465]]

    (4) A Memorandum of Agreement with the Regional Administrator as 
required by Sec. 123.24;
    (5) Copies of all applicable State statutes and regulations, 
including those governing State administrative procedures;
    (b)(1) Within 30 days of receipt by EPA of a State program 
submission, EPA will notify the State whether its submission is 
complete. If EPA finds that a State's submission is complete, the 
statutory review period (i.e., the period of time allotted for formal 
EPA review of a proposed State program under CWA) shall be deemed to 
have begun on the date of receipt of the State's submission. If EPA 
finds that a State's submission is incomplete, the statutory review 
period shall not begin until all the necessary information is received 
by EPA.
    (2) In the case of an Indian Tribe eligible under Sec. 123.33(b), 
EPA shall take into consideration the contents of the Tribe's request 
submitted under Sec. 123.32, in determining if the program submission 
required by Sec. 123.21(a) is complete.
    (c) If the State's submission is materially changed during the 
statutory review period, the statutory review period shall begin again 
upon receipt of the revised submission.
    (d) The State and EPA may extend the statutory review period by 
agreement.

[48 FR 14178, Apr. 1, 1983; 50 FR 6941, Feb. 19, 1985, as amended at 58 
FR 67981, Dec. 22, 1993; 59 FR 64343, Dec. 14, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 123.22  Program description.

    Any State that seeks to administer a program under this part shall 
submit a description of the program it proposes to administer in lieu of 
the Federal program under State law or under an interstate compact. The 
program description shall include:
    (a) A description in narrative form of the scope, structure, 
coverage and processes of the State program.
    (b) A description (including organization charts) of the 
organization and structure of the State agency or agencies which will 
have responsibility for administering the program, including the 
information listed below. If more than one agency is responsible for 
administration of a program, each agency must have statewide 
jurisdiction over a class of activities. The responsibilities of each 
agency must be delineated, their procedures for coordination set forth, 
and an agency may be designated as a ``lead agency'' to facilitate 
communications between EPA and the State agencies having program 
responsibility. If the State proposes to administer a program of greater 
scope of coverage than is required by Federal law, the information 
provided under this paragraph shall indicate the resources dedicated to 
administering the Federally required portion of the program.
    (1) A description of the State agency staff who will carry out the 
State program, including the number, occupations, and general duties of 
the employees. The State need not submit complete job descriptions for 
every employee carrying out the State program.
    (2) An itemization of the estimated costs of establishing and 
administering the program for the first two years after approval, 
including cost of the personnel listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, cost of administrative support, and cost of technical support.
    (3) An itemization of the sources and amounts of funding, including 
an estimate of Federal grant money, available to the State Director for 
the first two years after approval to meet the costs listed in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, identifying any restrictions or limitations upon 
this funding.
    (c) A description of applicable State procedures, including 
permitting procedures and any State administrative or judicial review 
procedures;
    (d) Copies of the permit form(s), application form(s), and reporting 
form(s) the State intends to employ in its program. Forms used by States 
need not be identical to the forms used by EPA but should require the 
same basic information, except that State NPDES programs are required to 
use standard Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMR). The State need not 
provide copies of uniform national forms it intends to use but should 
note its intention to use such forms.

    Note: States are encouraged to use uniform national forms 
established by the Administrator. If uniform national forms are used, 
they may be modified to include the

[[Page 466]]

State Agency's name, address, logo, and other similar information, as 
appropriate, in place of EPA's.

    (e) A complete description of the State's compliance tracking and 
enforcement program.
    (f) A State seeking approval of a sludge management program under 
section 405(f) of the CWA as part of its NPDES program, in addition to 
the above requirements of this section, shall include the inventory as 
required in 40 CFR 501.12(f).
    (g) In the case of Indian Tribes eligible under Sec. 123.33(b), if a 
State has been authorized by EPA to issue permits on the Federal Indian 
reservation in accordance with Sec. 123.23(b), a description of how 
responsibility for pending permit applications, existing permits, and 
supporting files will be transferred from the State to the eligible 
Indian Tribe. To the maximum extent practicable, this should include a 
Memorandum of Agreement negotiated between the State and the Indian 
Tribe addressing the arrangements for such transfer.

[48 FR 14178, Apr. 1, 1983; 50 FR 6941, Feb. 19, 1985, as amended at 54 
FR 18784, May 2, 1989; 58 FR 67981, Dec. 22, 1993; 59 FR 64343, Dec. 14,

<R05>
Sec. 123.23  Attorney General's statement.

    (a) Any State that seeks to administer a program under this part 
shall submit a statement from the State Attorney General (or the 
attorney for those State or interstate agencies which have independent 
legal counsel) that the laws of the State, or an interstate compact, 
provide adequate authority to carry out the program described under 
Sec. 123.22 and to meet the requirements of this part. This statement 
shall include citations to the specific statutes, administrative 
regulations, and, where appropriate, judicial decisions which 
demonstrate adequate authority. State statutes and regulations cited by 
the State Attorney General or independent legal counsel shall be in the 
form of lawfully adopted State statutes and regulations at the time the 
statement is signed and shall be fully effective by the time the program 
is approved. To qualify as ``independent legal counsel'' the attorney 
signing the statement required by this section must have full authority 
to independently represent the State agency in court on all matters 
pertaining to the State program.

    Note: EPA will supply States with an Attorney General's statement 
format on request.

    (b) If a State (which is not an Indian Tribe) seeks authority over 
activities on Indian lands, the statement shall contain an appropriate 
analysis of the State's authority.
    (c) The Attorney General's statement shall certify that the State 
has adequate legal authority to issue and enforce general permits if the 
State seeks to implement the general permit program under Sec. 122.28.

[48 FR 14178, Apr. 1, 1983, as amended at 58 FR 67981, Dec. 22, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 123.24  Memorandum of Agreement with the Regional Administrator.

    (a) Any State that seeks to administer a program under this part 
shall submit a Memorandum of Agreement. The Memorandum of Agreement 
shall be executed by the State Director and the Regional Administrator 
and shall become effective when approved by the Administrator. In 
addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, 
the Memorandum of Agreement may include other terms, conditions, or 
agreements consistent with this part and relevant to the administration 
and enforcement of the State's regulatory program. The Administrator 
shall not approve any Memorandum of Agreement which contains provisions 
which restrict EPA's statutory oversight responsibility.
    (b) The Memorandum of Agreement shall include the following:
    (1)(i) Provisions for the prompt transfer from EPA to the State of 
pending permit applications and any other information relevant to 
program operation not already in the possession of the State Director 
(e.g., support files for permit issuance, compliance reports, etc.). If 
existing permits are transferred from EPA to the State for 
administration, the Memorandum of Agreement shall contain provisions 
specifying a procedure for transferring the administration of these 
permits. If a State lacks the authority to directly

[[Page 467]]

administer permits issued by the Federal government, a procedure may be 
established to transfer responsibility for these permits.

    Note: For example, EPA and the State and the permittee could agree 
that the State would issue a permit(s) identical to the outstanding 
Federal permit which would simultaneously be terminated.

    (ii) Where a State has been authorized by EPA to issue permits in 
accordance with Sec. 123.23(b) on the Federal Indian reservation of the 
Indian Tribe seeking program approval, provisions describing how the 
transfer of pending permit applications, permits, and any other 
information relevant to the program operation not already in the 
possession of the Indian Tribe (support files for permit issuance, 
compliance reports, etc.) will be accomplished.
    (2) Provisions specifying classes and categories of permit 
applications, draft permits, and proposed permits that the State will 
send to the Regional Administrator for review, comment and, where 
applicable, objection.
    (3) Provisions specifying the frequency and content of reports, 
documents and other information which the State is required to submit to 
EPA. The State shall allow EPA to routinely review State records, 
reports, and files relevant to the administration and enforcement of the 
approved program. State reports may be combined with grant reports where 
appropriate. These procedures shall implement the requirements of 
Sec. 123.43.
    (4) Provisions on the State's compliance monitoring and enforcement 
program, including:
    (i) Provisions for coordination of compliance monitoring activities 
by the State and by EPA. These may specify the basis on which the 
Regional Administrator will select facilities or activities within the 
State for EPA inspection. The Regional Administrator will normally 
notify the State at least 7 days before any such inspection; and
    (ii) Procedures to assure coordination of enforcement activities.
    (5) When appropriate, provisions for joint processing of permits by 
the State and EPA for facilities or activities which require permits 
from both EPA and the State under different programs. (See Sec. 124.4.)

    Note: To promote efficiency and to avoid duplication and 
inconsistency, States are encouraged to enter into joint processing 
agreements with EPA for permit issuance. Likewise, States are encouraged 
(but not required) to consider steps to coordinate or consolidate their 
own permit programs and activities.

    (6) Provisions for modification of the Memorandum of Agreement in 
accordance with this part.
    (c) The Memorandum of Agreement, the annual program grant and the 
State/EPA Agreement should be consistent. If the State/EPA Agreement 
indicates that a change is needed in the Memorandum of Agreement, the 
Memorandum of Agreement may be amended through the procedures set forth 
in this part. The State/EPA Agreement may not override the Memorandum of 
Agreement.

    Note: Detailed program priorities and specific arrangements for EPA 
support of the State program will change and are therefore more 
appropriately negotiated in the context of annual agreements rather than 
in the MOA. However, it may still be appropriate to specify in the MOA 
the basis for such detailed agreements, e.g., a provision in the MOA 
specifying that EPA will select facilities in the State for inspection 
annually as part of the State/EPA agreement.

    (d) The Memorandum of Agreement shall also specify the extent to 
which EPA will waive its right to review, object to, or comment upon 
State-issued permits under section 402(d)(3), (e) or (f) of CWA. While 
the Regional Administrator and the State may agree to waive EPA review 
of certain ``classes or categories'' of permits, no waiver of review may

[[Page 469]]


    Note: States need not implement provisions identical to the above 
listed provisions. Implemented provisions must, however, establish 
requirements at least as stringent as the corresponding listed 
provisions. While States may impose more stringent requirements, they 
may not make one requirement more lenient as a tradeoff for making 
another requirement more stringent; for example, by requiring that 
public hearings be held prior to issuing any permit while reducing the 
amount of advance notice of such a hearing.
    State programs may, if they have adequate legal authority, implement 
any of the provisions of parts 122 and 124. See, for example, 
Sec. 122.5(d) (continuation of permits) and Sec. 124.4 (consolidation of 
permit processing).
    For example, a State may impose more stringent requirements in an 
NPDES program by omitting the upset provision of Sec. 122.41 or by 
requiring more prompt notice of an upset.

    (b) State NPDES programs shall have an approved continuing planning 
process under 40 CFR 35.1500 and shall assure that the approved planning 
process is at all times consistent with CWA.
    (c) State NPDES programs shall ensure that any board or body which 
approves all or portions of permits shall not include as a member any 
person who receives, or has during the previous 2 years received, a 
significant portion of income directly or indirectly from permit holders 
or applicants for a permit.
    (1) For the purposes of this paragraph:
    (i) Board or body includes any individual, including the Director, 
who has or shares authority to approve all or portions of permits either 
in the first instance, as modified or reissued, or on appeal.
    (ii) Significant portion of income means 10 percent or more of gross 
personal income for a calendar year, except that it means 50 percent or 
more of gross personal income for a calendar year if the recipient is 
over 60 years of age and is receiving that portion under retirement, 
pension, or similar arrangement.
    (iii) Permit holders or applicants for a permit does not include any 
department or agency of a State government, such as a Department of 
Parks or a Department of Fish and Wildlife.
    (iv) Income includes retirement benefits, consultant fees, and stock 
dividends.
    (2) For the purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, income is not 
received ``directly or indirectly from permit holders or applicants for 
a permit'' when it is derived from mutual fund payments, or from other 
diversified investments for which the recipient does not know the 
identity of the primary sources of income.

Sec. 123.26  Requirements for compliance evaluation programs.

    (a) State programs shall have procedures for receipt, evaluation, 
retention and investigation for possible enforcement of all notices and 
reports required of permittees and other regulated persons (and for 
investigation for possible enforcement of failure to submit these 
notices and reports).
    (b) State programs shall have inspection and surveillance procedures 
to determine, independent of information supplied by regulated persons, 
compliance or noncompliance with applicable program requirements. The 
State shall maintain:
    (1) A program which is capable of making comprehensive surveys of 
all facilities and activities subject to the State Director's authority 
to identify persons subject to regulation who have failed to comply with 
permit application or other program requirements. Any compilation, index 
or inventory of such facilities and activities shall be made available 
to the Regional Administrator upon request;
    (2) A program for periodic inspections of the facilities and 
activities subject to regulation. These inspections shall be conducted 
in a manner designed to:
    (i) Determine compliance or noncompliance with issued permit 
conditions and other program requirements;
    (ii) Verify the accuracy of information submitted by permittees and 
other regulated persons in reporting forms and other forms supplying 
monitoring data; and

[[Page 470]]

    (iii) Verify the adequacy of sampling, monitoring, and other methods 
used by permittees and other regulated persons to develop that 
information;
    (3) A program for investigating information obtained regarding 
violations of applicable program and permit requirements; and
    (4) Procedures for receiving and ensuring proper consideration of 
information submitted by the Public about violations. Public effort in 
reporting violations shall be encouraged, and the State Director shall 
make available information on reporting procedures.
    (c) The State Director and State officers engaged in compliance 
evaluation shall have authority to enter any site or premises subject to 
regulation or in which records relevant to program operation are kept in 
order to copy any records, inspect, monitor or otherwise investigate 
compliance with the State program including compliance with permit 
conditions and other program requirements. States whose law requires a 
search warrant before entry conform with this requirement.
    (d) Investigatory inspections shall be conducted, samples shall be 
taken and other information shall be gathered in a manner (e.g., using 
proper ``chain of custody'' procedures) that will produce evidence 
admissible in an enforcement proceeding or in court.
    (e) State NPDES compliance evaluation programs shall have procedures 
and ability for:
    (1) Maintaining a comprehensive inventory of all sources covered by 
NPDES permits and a schedule of reports required to be submitted by 
permittees to the State agency;
    (2) Initial screening (i.e., pre-enforcement evaluation) of all 
permit or grant-related compliance information to identify violations 
and to establish priorities for further substantive technical 
evaluation;
    (3) When warranted, conducting a substantive technical evaluation 
following the initial screening of all permit or grant-related 
compliance information to determine the appropriate agency response;
    (4) Maintaining a management information system which supports the 
compliance evaluation activities of this part; and
    (5) Inspecting the facilities of all major dischargers and all Class 
I sludge management facilities (as defined in 40 CFR 501.2) where 
applicable at least annually.

<R05>
Sec. 123.27  Requirements for enforcement authority.

    (a) Any State agency administering a program shall have available 
the following remedies for violations of State program requirements:
    (1) To restrain immediately and effectively any person by order or 
by suit in State court from engaging in any unauthorized activity which 
is endangering or causing damage to public health or the environment;

    Note: This paragraph (a)(1) requires that States have a mechanism 
(e.g., an administrative cease and desist order or the ability to seek a 
temporary restraining order) to stop any unauthorized activity 
endangering public health or the environment.

    (2) To sue in courts of competent jurisdiction to enjoin any 
threatened or continuing violation of any program requirement, including 
permit conditions, without the necessity of a prior revocation of the 
permit;
    (3) To assess or sue to recover in court civil penalties and to seek 
criminal remedies, including fines, as follows:
    (i) Civil penalties shall be recoverable for the violation of any 
NPDES permit condition; any NPDES filing requirement; any duty to allow 
or carry out inspection, entry or monitoring activities; or, any 
regulation or orders issued by the State Director. These penalties shall 
be assessable in at least the amount of $5,000 a day for each violation.
    (ii) Criminal fines shall be recoverable against any person who 
willfully or negligently violates any applicable standards or 
limitations; any NPDES permit condition; or any NPDES filing 
requirement. These fines shall be assessable in at least the amount of 
$10,000 a day for each violation.

    Note: States which provide the criminal remedies based on ``criminal 
negligence,'' ``gross negligence'' or strict liability satisfy the 
requirement of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section.


[[Page 471]]


    (iii) Criminal fines shall be recoverable against any person who 
knowingly makes any false statement, representation or certification in 
any NPDES form, in any notice or report required by an NPDES permit, or 
who knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method 
required to be maintained by the Director. These fines shall be 
recoverable in at least the amount of $5,000 for each instance of 
violation.

    Note: In many States the State Director will be represented in State 
courts by the State Attorney General or other appropriate legal officer. 
Although the State Director need not appear in court actions he or she 
should have power to request that any of the above actions be brought.

    (b)(1) The maximum civil penalty or criminal fine (as provided in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section) shall be assessable for each instance 
of violation and, if the violation is continuous, shall be assessable up 
to the maximum amount for each day of violation.
    (2) The burden of proof and degree of knowledge or intent required 
under State law for establishing violations under paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section, shall be no greater than the burden of proof or degree of 
knowledge or intent EPA must provide when it brings an action under the 
appropriate Act;

    Note: For example, this requirement is not met if State law includes 
mental state as an element of proof for civil violations.

    (c) A civil penalty assessed, sought, or agreed upon by the State 
Director under paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall be appropriate to 
the violation.

    Note: To the extent that State judgments or settlements provide 
penalties in amounts which EPA believes to be substantially inadequate 
in comparison to the amounts which EPA would require under similar 
facts, EPA, when authorized by the applicable statute, may commence 
separate actions for penalties.
    Procedures for assessment by the State of the cost of 
investigations, inspections, or monitoring surveys which lead to the 
establishment of violations;
    In addition to the requirements of this paragraph, the State may 
have other enforcement remedies. The following enforcement options, 
while not mandatory, are highly recommended:
    Procedures which enable the State to assess or to sue any persons 
responsible for unauthorized activities for any expenses incurred by the 
State in removing, correcting, or terminating any adverse effects upon 
human health and the environment resulting from the unauthorized 
activity, whether or not accidental;
    Procedures which enable the State to sue for compensation for any 
loss or destruction of wildlife, fish or aquatic life, or their habitat, 
and for any other damages caused by unauthorized activity, either to the 
State or to any residents of the State who are directly aggrieved by the 
unauthorized activity, or both; and
    Procedures for the administrative assessment of penalties by the 
Director.

    (d) Any State administering a program shall provide for public 
participation in the State enforcement process by providing either:
    (1) Authority which allows intervention as of right in any civil or 
administrative action to obtain remedies specified in paragraphs (a)(1), 
(2) or (3) of this section by any citizen having an interest which is or 
may be adversely affected; or
    (2) Assurance that the State agency or enforcement authority will:
    (i) Investigate and provide written responses to all citizen 
complaints submitted pursuant to the procedures specified in 
Sec. 123.26(b)(4);
    (ii) Not oppose intervention by any citizen when permissive 
intervention may be authorized by statute, rule, or regulation; and
    (iii) Publish notice of and provide at least 30 days for public 
comment on any proposed settlement of a State enforcement action.
    (e) Indian Tribes that cannot satisfy the criminal enforcement 
authority requirements of this section may still receive program 
approval if they meet the requirement for enforcement authority 
established under Sec. 123.34.

<R05>
Sec. 123.28  Control of disposal of pollutants into wells.

    State law must provide authority to issue permits to control the 
disposal of

[[Page 472]]

pollutants into wells. Such authority shall enable the State to protect 
the public health and welfare and to prevent the pollution of ground and 
surface waters by prohibiting well discharges or by issuing permits for 
such discharges with appropriate permit terms and conditions. A program 
approved under section 1422 of SDWA satisfies the requirements of this 
section.

    Note: States which are authorized to administer the NPDES permit 
program under section 402 of CWA are encouraged to rely on existing 
statutory authority, to the extent possible, in developing a State UIC 
program under section 1422 of SDWA. Section 402(b)(1)(D) of CWA requires 
that NPDES States have the authority ``to issue permits which * * * 
control the disposal of pollutants into wells.'' In many instances, 
therefore, NPDES States will have existing statutory authority to 
regulate well disposal which satisfies the requirements of the UIC 
program. Note, however, that CWA excludes certain types of well 
injections from the definition of ``pollutant.'' If the State's 
statutory authority contains a similar exclusion it may need to be 
modified to qualify for UIC program approval.


<R05>
Sec. 123.29  Prohibition.

    State permit programs shall provide that no permit shall be issued 
when the Regional Administrator has objected in writing under 
Sec. 123.44.


<R05>
Sec. 123.30  Judicial review of approval or denial of permits.

    All States that administer or seek to administer a program under 
this part shall provide an opportunity for judicial review in State 
Court of the final approval or denial of permits by the State that is 
sufficient to provide for, encourage, and assist public participation in 
the permitting process. A State will meet this standard if State law 
allows an opportunity for judicial review that is the same as that 
available to obtain judicial review in federal court of a federally-
issued NPDES permit (see Sec. 509 of the Clean Water Act). A State will 
not meet this standard if it narrowly restricts the class of persons who 
may challenge the approval or denial of permits (for example, if only 
the permittee can obtain judicial review, if persons must demonstrate 
injury to a pecuniary interest in order to obtain judicial review, or if 
persons must have a property interest in close proximity to a discharge 
or surface waters in order to obtain judicial review.) This requirement 
does not apply to Indian Tribes.

Sec. 123.31   Requirements for eligibility of Indian Tribes.

    (a) Consistent with section 518(e) of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. 1377(e), 
the Regional Administrator will treat an Indian Tribe as eligible to 
apply for NPDES program authority if it meets the following criteria:
    (1) The Indian Tribe is recognized by the Secretary of the Interior.
    (2) The Indian Tribe has a governing body carrying out substantial 
governmental duties and powers.
    (3) The functions to be exercised by the Indian Tribe pertain to the 
management and protection of water resources which are held by an Indian 
Tribe, held by the United States in trust for the Indians, held by a 
member of an Indian Tribe if such property interest is subject to a 
trust restriction on alienation, or otherwise within the borders of an 
Indian reservation.
    (4) The Indian Tribe is reasonably expected to be capable, in the 
Regional Administrator's judgment, of carrying out the functions to be 
exercised, in a manner consistent with the terms and purposes of the Act 
and applicable regulations, of an effective NPDES permit program.
    (b) An Indian Tribe which the Regional Administrator determines 
meets the criteria described in paragraph (a) of this section must also 
satisfy the State program requirements described in this part for 
assumption of the State program.

by the Tribal governing body, such as, but not limited to, the exercise 
of police powers affecting (or relating to) the health, safety, and 
welfare of the affected population; taxation; and the exercise of the 
power of eminent domain; and
    (3) Identify the source of the Tribal government's authority to 
carry out the governmental functions currently being performed.
    (c) A map or legal description of the area over which the Indian 
Tribe asserts authority under section 518(e)(2) of the Act; a statement 
by the Tribal Attorney General (or equivalent official authorized to 
represent the Tribe in all legal matters in court pertaining to the 
program for which it seeks approval) which describes the basis for the 
Tribe's assertion (including the nature or subject matter of the 
asserted regulatory authority); copies of those documents such as Tribal 
constitutions, by-laws, charters, executive orders, codes, ordinances, 
and/or resolutions which support the Tribe believes are relevant to its 
assertion under section 518(e)(2) of the Act; and a description of the 
location of the surface waters for which the Tribe proposes to establish 
an NPDES permit program.
    (d) A narrative statement describing the capability of the Indian 
Tribe to administer an effective, environmentally sound NPDES permit 
program. The statement should include:
    (1) A description of the Indian Tribe's previous management 
experience which may include the administration of programs and service 
authorized by the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act 
(25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.), the Indian Mineral Development Act (25 U.S.C. 
2101 et seq.), or the Indian Sanitation Facility Construction Activity 
Act (42 U.S.C. 2004a);
    (2) A list of existing environmental or public health programs 
administered by the Tribal governing body, and a copy of related Tribal 
laws, regulations, and policies;

executive, legislative, and judicial functions of the Tribal government;
    (4) A description of the existing, or proposed, agency of the Indian 
Tribe which will assume primary responsibility for establishing and 
administering an NPDES permit program (including a description of the 
relationship between the existing or proposed agency and its regulated 
entities);
    (5) A description of the technical and administrative abilities of 
the staff to administer and manage an effective, environmentally sound 
NPDES permit program or a plan which proposes how the Tribe will acquire 
additional administrative and technical expertise. The plan must address 
how the Tribe will obtain the funds to acquire the administrative and 
technical expertise.
    (e) The Regional Administrator may, at his or her discretion, 
request further documentation necessary to support a Tribe's 
eligibility.
    (f) If the Administrator or his or her delegatee has previously 
determined that a Tribe has met the prerequisites that make it eligible 
to assume a role similar to that of a state as provided by statute under 
the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water Act, or the Clean Air Act, 
then that Tribe need provide only that information unique to the NPDES 
program which is requested by the Regional Administrator.

was collected by EPA. The Memorandum of Agreement under Sec. 123.24 
shall provide for the following, in such manner as the State Director 
and the Regional Administrator shall agree:
    (a) Prompt transmission to the State Director from the Regional 
Administrator of copies of any pending permit applications or any other 
relevant information collected before the approval of the State permit 
program and not already in the possession of the State Director. When 
existing permits are transferred to the State Director (e.g., for 
purposes of compliance monitoring, enforcement or reissuance), relevant 
information includes support files for permit issuance, compliance 
reports and records of enforcement actions.
    (b) Procedures to ensure that the State Director will not issue a 
permit on the basis of any application received from the Regional 
Administrator which the Regional Administrator identifies as incomplete 
or otherwise deficient until the State Director receives information 
sufficient to correct the deficiency.


<R05>
Sec. 123.43  Transmission of information to EPA.

    (a) Each State agency administering a permit program shall transmit 
to the Regional Administrator copies of permit program forms and any 
other relevant information to the extent and in the manner agreed to by 
the State Director and Regional Administrator in the Memorandum of 
Agreement and not inconsistent with this part. Proposed permits shall be 
prepared by State agencies unless agreement to the contrary has been 
reached under Sec. 123.44(j). The Memorandum of Agreement shall provide 
for the following:
    (1) Prompt transmission to the Regional Administrator of a copy of 
all complete permit applications received by the State Director, except 
those for

[[Page 475]]

which permit review has been waived under Sec. 123.24(d). The State 
shall supply EPA with copies of permit applications for which permit 
review has been waived whenever requested by EPA;
    (2) Prompt transmission to the Regional Administrator of notice of 
every action taken by the State agency related to the consideration of 
any permit application or general permit, including a copy of each 
proposed or draft permit and any conditions, requirements, or documents 
which are related to the proposed or draft permit or which affect the 
authorization of the proposed permit, except those for which permit 
review has been waived under Sec. 123.24(d). The State shall supply EPA 
with copies of notices for which permit review has been waived whenever 
requested by EPA; and
    (3) Transmission to the Regional Administrator of a copy of every 
issued permit following issuance, along with any and all conditions, 
requirements, or documents which are related to or affect the 
authorization of the permit.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) The State program shall provide for transmission by the State 
Director to EPA of:
    (1) Notices from publicly owned treatment works under Sec. 122.42(b) 
and 40 CFR part 403, upon request of the Regional Administrator;
    (2) A copy of any significant comments presented in writing pursuant 
to the public notice of a draft permit and a summary of any significant 
comments presented at any hearing on any draft permit, except those 
comments regarding permits for which permit review has been waived under 
Sec. 123.24(d) and for which EPA has not otherwise requested receipt, 
if:
    (i) The Regional Administrator requests this information; or
    (ii) The proposed permit contains requirements significantly 
different from those contained in the tentative determination and draft 
permit; or
    (iii) Significant comments objecting to the tentative determination 
and draft permit have been presented at the hearing or in writing 
pursuant to the public notice.
    (d) Any State permit program shall keep such records and submit to 
the Administrator such information as the Administrator may reasonably 
require to ascertain whether the State program complies with the 
requirements of CWA or of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 123.44  EPA review of and objections to State permits.

    (a)(1) The Memorandum of Agreement shall provide a period of time 
(up to 90 days from receipt of proposed permits) to which the Regional 
Administrator may make general comments upon, objections to, or 
recommendations with respect to proposed permits. EPA reserves the right 
to take 90 days to supply specific grounds for objection, 
notwithstanding any shorter period specified in the Memorandum of 
Agreement, when a general objection is filed within the review period 
specified in the Memorandum of Agreement. The Regional Administrator 
shall send a copy of any comment, objection or recommendation to the 
permit applicant.
    (2) In the case of general permits, EPA shall have 90 days from the 
date of receipt of the proposed general permit to comment upon, object 
to or make recommendations with respect to the proposed general permit, 
and is not bound by any shorter time limits set by the Memorandum of 
Agreement for general comments, objections or recommendations. The EPA 
Director, Office of Water Enforcement and Permits may comment upon, 
object to, or make recommendations with respect to proposed general 
permits, except those for separate storm sewers, on EPA's behalf.
    (b)(1) Within the period of time provided under the Memorandum of 
Agreement for making general comments upon, objections to or 
recommendations with respect to proposed permits, the Regional 
Administrator shall notify the State Director of any objection to 
issuance of a proposed permit (except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section for proposed general permits). This notification shall set 
forth in writing the general nature of the objection.
    (2) Within 90 days following receipt of a proposed permit to which 
he or she has objected under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or in the 
case of general

[[Page 476]]

permits within 90 days after receipt of the proposed general permit, the 
Regional Administrator, or in the case of general permits other than for 
separate storm sewers, the Regional Administrator or the EPA Director, 
Office of Water Enforcement and Permits, shall set forth in writing and 
transmit to the State Director:
    (i) A statement of the reasons for the objection (including the 
section of CWA or regulations that support the objection), and
    (ii) The actions that must be taken by the State Director to 
eliminate the objection (including the effluent limitations and 
conditions which the permit would include if it were issued by the 
Regional Administrator.)

    Note: Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, in effect, modify any 
existing agreement between EPA and the State which provides less than 90 
days for EPA to supply the specific grounds for an objection. However, 
when an agreement provides for an EPA review period of less than 90 
days, EPA must file a general objection, in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section within the time specified in the agreement. This 
general objection must be followed by a specific objection within the 
90-day period. This modification to MOA's allows EPA to provide detailed 
information concerning acceptable permit conditions, as required by 
section 402(d) of CWA. To avoid possible confusion, MOA's should be 
changed to reflect this arrangement.

    (c) The Regional Administrator's objection to the issuance of a 
proposed permit must be based upon one or more of the following grounds:
    (1) The permit fails to apply, or to ensure compliance with, any 
applicable requirement of this part;

    Note: For example, the Regional Administrator may object to a permit 
not requiring the achievement of required effluent limitations by 
applicable statutory deadlines.

    (2) In the case of a proposed permit for which notification to the 
Administrator is required under section 402(b)(5) of CWA, the written 
recommendations of an affected State have not been accepted by the 
permitting State and the Regional Administrator finds the reasons for 
rejecting the recommendations are inadequate;
    (3) The procedures followed in connection with formulation of the 
proposed permit failed in a material respect to comply with procedures 
required by CWA or by regulations thereunder or by the Memorandum of 
Agreement;
    (4) Any finding made by the State Director in connection with the 
proposed permit misinterprets CWA or any guidelines or regulations under 
CWA, or misapplies them to the facts;
    (5) Any provisions of the proposed permit relating to the 
maintenance of records, reporting, monitoring, sampling, or the 
provision of any other information by the permittee are inadequate, in 
the judgment of the Regional Administrator, to assure compliance with 
permit conditions, including effluent standards and limitations or 
standards for sewage sludge use and disposal required by CWA, by the 
guidelines and regulations issued under CWA, or by the proposed permit;
    (6) In the case of any proposed permit with respect to which 
applicable effluent standards and limitations or standards for sewage 
sludge use and disposal under sections 301, 302, 306, 307, 318, 403, and 
405 of CWA have not yet been promulgated by the Agency, the proposed 
permit, in the judgment of the Regional Administrator, fails to carry 
out the provisions of CWA or of any regulations issued under CWA; the 
provisions of this paragraph apply to determinations made pursuant to 
Sec. 125.3(c)(2) in the absence of applicable guidelines, to best 
management practices under section 304(e) of CWA, which must be 
incorporated into permits as requirements under section 301, 306, 307, 
318, 403 or 405, and to sewage sludge use and disposal requirements 
developed on a case-by-case basis pursuant to section 405(d) of CWA, as 
the case may be;
    (7) Issuance of the proposed permit would in any other respect be 
outside the requirements of CWA, or regulations issued under CWA.
    (8) The effluent limits of a permit fail to satisfy the requirements 
of 40 CFR 122.44(d).
    (9) For a permit issued by a Great Lakes State or Tribe (as defined 
in 40 CFR 132.2), the permit does not satisfy the conditions promulgated 
by the State, Tribe, or EPA pursuant to 40 CFR part 132.
    (d) Prior to notifying the State Director of an objection based upon 
any

[[Page 477]]

of the grounds set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the Regional 
Administrator:
    (1) Shall consider all data transmitted pursuant to Sec. 123.43;
    (2) May, if the information provided is inadequate to determine 
whether the proposed permit meets the guidelines and requirements of 
CWA, request the State Director to transmit to the Regional 
Administrator the complete record of the permit proceedings before the 
State, or any portions of the record that the Regional Administrator 
determines are necessary for review. If this request is made within 30 
days of receipt of the State submittal under Sec. 123.43, it shall 
constitute an interim objection to the issuance of the permit, and the 
full period of time specified in the Memorandum of Agreement for the 
Regional Administrator's review shall recommence when the Regional 
Administrator has received such record or portions of the record; and
    (3) May, in his or her discretion, and to the extent feasible within 
the period of time available under the Memorandum of Agreement, afford 
to interested persons an opportunity to comment on the basis for the 
objection;
    (e) Within 90 days of receipt by the State Director of an objection 
by the Regional Administrator, the State or interstate agency or any 
interested person may request that a public hearing be held by the 
Regional Administrator on the objection. A public hearing in accordance 
with the procedures of Sec. 124.12 (c) and (d) shall be held, and public 
notice provided in accordance with Sec. 124.10, whenever requested by 
the State or the interstate agency which proposed the permit or if 
warranted by significant public interest based on requests received.
    (f) A public hearing held under paragraph (e) of this section shall 
be conducted by the Regional Administrator, and, at the Regional 
Administrator's discretion, with the assistance of an EPA panel 
designated by the Regional Administrator, in an orderly and expeditious 
manner.
    (g) Following the public hearing, the Regional Administrator shall 
reaffirm the original objection, modify the terms of the objection, or 
withdraw the objection, and shall notify the State of this decision.
    (h)(1) If no public hearing is held under paragraph (e) of this 
section and the State does not resubmit a permit revised to meet the 
Regional Administrator's objection within 90 days of receipt of the 
objection, the Regional Administrator may issue the permit in accordance 
with parts 121, 122 and 124 of this chapter and any other guidelines and 
requirements of CWA.
    (2) If a public hearing is held under paragraph (e) of this section, 
the Regional Administrator does not withdraw the objection, and the 
State does not resubmit a permit revised to meet the Regional 
Administrator's objection or modified objection within 30 days of the 
date of the Regional Administrator's notification under paragraph (g) of 
this section, the Regional Administrator may issue the permit in 
accordance with parts 121, 122 and 124 of this chapter and any other 
guidelines and requirements of CWA.
    (3) Exclusive authority to issue the permit passes to EPA when the 
times set out in this paragraph expire.
    (i) In the case of proposed general permits for discharges other 
than from separate storm sewers insert ``or the EPA Director, Office of 
Water Enforcement and Permits'' after ``Regional Administrator'' 
whenever it appears in paragraphs (c) through (h) of this section.
    (j) The Regional Administrator may agree, in the Memorandum of 
Agreement under Sec. 123.24, to review draft permits rather than 
proposed permits. In such a case, a proposed permit need not be prepared 
by the State and transmitted to the Regional Administrator for review in 
accordance with this section unless the State proposes to issue a permit 
which differs from the draft permit reviewed by the Regional 
Administrator, the Regional Administrator has objected to the draft 
permit, or there is significant public comment.

<R05>
Sec. 123.45  Noncompliance and program reporting by the Director.

    The Director shall prepare quarterly, semi-annual, and annual 
reports as detailed below. When the State is the permit-issuing 
authority, the State Director shall submit all reports required under 
this section to the Regional Administrator, and the EPA Region in turn 
shall submit the State reports to EPA Headquarters. When EPA is the 
permit-issuing authority, the Regional Administrator shall submit all 
reports required under this section to EPA Headquarters.
    (a) Quarterly reports. The Director shall submit quarterly narrative 
reports for major permittees as follows:
    (1) Format. The report shall use the following format:
    (i) Provide a separate list of major NPDES permittees which shall be 
subcategorized as non-POTWs, POTWs, and Federal permittees.
    (ii) Alphabetize each list by permittee name. When two or more 
permittees have the same name, the permittee with the lowest permit 
number shall be entered first.
    (iii) For each permittee on the list, include the following 
information in the following order:
    (A) The name, location, and permit number.
    (B) A brief description and date of each instance of noncompliance 
for which paragraph (a)(2) of this section requires reporting. Each 
listing shall indicate each specific provision of paragraph (a)(2) 
(e.g., (ii)(A) thru (iii)(G)) which describes the reason for reporting 
the violation on the quarterly report.
    (C) The date(s), and a brief description of the action(s) taken by 
the Director to ensure compliance.
    (D) The status of the instance(s) of noncompliance and the date 
noncompliance was resolved.
    (E) Any details which tend to explain or mitigate the instance(s) of 
noncompliance.
    (2) Instances of noncompliance by major dischargers to be reported--
(i) General. Instances of noncompliance, as defined in paragraphs 
(a)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section, by major dischargers shall be 
reported in successive reports until the noncompliance is reported as 
resolved (i.e., the permittee is no longer violating the permit 
conditions reported as noncompliance in the QNCR). Once an instance of 
noncompliance is reported as resolved in the QNCR, it need not appear in 
subsequent reports.
    (A) All reported violations must be listed on the QNCR for the 
reporting period when the violation occurred, even if the violation is 
resolved during that reporting period.
    (B) All permittees under current enforcement orders (i.e., 
administrative and judicial orders and consent decrees) for previous 
instances of noncompliance must be listed in the QNCR until the orders 
have been satisfied in full and the permittee is in compliance with 
permit conditions. If the permittee is in compliance with the 
enforcement order, but has not achieved full compliance with permit 
conditions, the compliance status shall be reported as ``resolved 
pending,'' but the permittee will continue to be listed on the QNCR.
    (ii) Category I noncompliance. The following instances of 
noncompliance by major dischargers are Category I noncompliance:
    (A) Violations of conditions in enforcement orders except compliance 
schedules and reports.
    (B) Violations of compliance schedule milestones for starting 
construction, completing construction, and attaining final compliance by 
90 days or more from the date of the milestone specified in an 
enforcement order or a permit.
    (C) Violations of permit effluent limits that exceed the Appendix A 
``Criteria for Noncompliance Reporting in the NPDES Program''.
    (D) Failure to provide a compliance schedule report for final 
compliance or a monitoring report. This applies when the permittee has 
failed to submit a final compliance schedule progress report, 
pretreatment report, or a Discharge Monitoring Report within 30 days 
from the due date specified in an enforcement order or a permit.
    (iii) Category II noncompliance. Category II noncompliance includes 
violations of permit conditions which the Agency believes to be of 
substantial concern and may not meet the Category I criteria. The 
following are instances of noncompliance which must

[[Page 479]]

be reported as Category II noncompliance unless the same violation meets 
the criteria for Category I noncompliance:
    (A) (1) Violation of a permit limit;
    (2) An unauthorized bypass;
    (3) An unpermitted discharge; or
    (4) A pass-through of pollutants which causes or has the potential 
to cause a water quality problem (e.g., fish kills, oil sheens) or 
health problems (e.g., beach closings, fishing bans, or other 
restrictions of beneficial uses).
    (B) Failure of an approved POTW to implement its approved 
pretreatment program adequately including failure to enforce industrial 
pretreatment requirements on industrial users as required in the 
approved program.
    (C) Violations of any compliance schedule milestones (except those 
milestones listed in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) by 90 days 
or more from the date specified in an enforcement order or a permit.
    (D) Failure of the permittee to provide reports (other than those 
reports listed in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(D) of this section) within 30 
days from the due date specified in an enforcement order or a permit.
    (E) Instances when the required reports provided by the permittee 
are so deficient or incomplete as to cause misunderstanding by the 
Director and thus impede the review of the status of compliance.
    (F) Violations of narrative requirements (e.g., requirements to 
develop Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plans and 
requirements to implement Best Management Practices), which are of 
substantial concern to the regulatory agency.
    (G) Any other violation or group of permit violations which the 
Director or Regional Administrator considers to be of substantial 
concern.
    (b) Semi-annual statistical summary report. Summary information 
shall be provided twice a year on the number of major permittees with 
two or more violations of the same monthly average permit limitation in 
a six month period, including those otherwise reported under paragraph 
(a) of this section. This report shall be submitted at the same time, 
according to the Federal fiscal year calendar, as the first and third 
quarter QNCRs.
    (c) Annual reports for NPDES--(1) Annual noncompliance report. 
Statistical reports shall be submitted by the Director on nonmajor NPDES 
permittees indicating the total number reviewed, the number of 
noncomplying nonmajor permittees, the number of enforcement actions, and 
number of permit modifications extending compliance deadlines. The 
statistical information shall be organized to follow the types of 
noncompliance listed in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) A separate list of nonmajor discharges which are one or more 
years behind in construction phases of the compliance schedule shall 
also be submitted in alphabetical order by name and permit number.
    (d) Schedule--(1) For all quarterly reports. On the last working day 
of May, August, November, and February, the State Director shall submit 
to the Regional Administrator information concerning noncompliance with 
NPDES permit requirements by major dischargers in the State in acordance 
with the following schedule. The Regional Administrator shall prepare 
and submit information for EPA-issued permits to EPA Headquarters in 
accordance with the same schedule:

   Quarters covered by reports on noncompliance by major dischargers:   
                    [Date for completion of reports]                    
  January, February, and March............  \1\ May 31                  
  April, May, and June....................  \1\ August 31               
  July, August, and September.............  \1\ November 30

\1\ Reports must be made available to the public for inspection and     
  copying on this date.                                                 

    (2) For all annual reports. The period for annual reports shall be 
for the calendar year ending December 31, with reports completed and 
available to the public no more than 60 days later.
    (e) Sludge noncompliance program reports. The Director shall prepare 
and submit semi-annual noncompliance and annual program reports as 
required under 40 CFR 501.21. The Director may

 Appendix A to Sec. 123.45--Criteria for Noncompliance Reporting in the 
                              NPDES Program

    This appendix describes the criteria for reporting violations of 
NPDES permit effluent limits in the quarterly noncompliance report 
(QNCR) as specified under Sec. 123.45(a)(2)(ii)(c). Any violation of an 
NPDES permit is a violation of the Clean Water Act (CWA) for which the 
permittee is liable. An agency's decision as to what enforcement action, 
if any, should be taken in such cases, will be based on an analysis of 
facts and legal requirements.

                  Violations of Permit Effluent Limits

    Cases in which violations of permit effluent limits must be reported 
depend upon the magnitude and/or frequency of the violation. Effluent 
violations should be evaluated on a parameter-by-parameter and outfall-
by-outfall basis. The criteria for reporting effluent violations are as 
follows:

 a. Reporting Criteria for Violations of Monthly Average Permit Limits--
                         Magnitude and Frequency

    Violations of monthly average effluent limits which exceed or equal 
the product of the Technical Review Criteria (TRC) times the effluent 
limit, and occur two months in a six month period must be reported. TRCs 
are for two groups of pollutants.

Group I Pollutants--TRC=1.4
Group II Pollutants--TRC=1.2

    b. Reporting Criteria for Chronic Violations of Monthly Average 
Limits
    Chronic violations must be reported in the QNCR if the monthly 
average permit limits are exceeded any four months in a six-month 
period. These criteria apply to all Group I and Group II pollutants.

                       Group I Pollutants--TRC=1.4

                              Oxygen Demand

Biochemical Oxygen Demand
Chemical Oxygen Demand
Total Oxygen Demands
Total Organic Carbon

<R05>
Sec. 123.46  Individual control strategies.

    (a) Not later than February 4, 1989, each State shall submit to the 
Regional Administrator for review, approval, and implementation an 
individual control strategy for each point source identified by the 
State pursuant to section 304(l)(1)(C) of the Act which discharges to a 
water identified by the State pursuant to section 304(l)(1)(B) which 
will produce a reduction in the discharge of toxic pollutants from the 
point sources identified under section 304(l)(1)(C) through the 
establishment of effluent limitations under section 402 of the CWA and 
water quality standards under section 303(c)(2)(B) of

[[Page 481]]

the CWA, which reduction is sufficient, in combination with existing 
controls on point and nonpoint sources of pollution, to achieve the 
applicable water quality standard as soon as possible, but not later 
than three years after the date of establishment of such strategy.
    (b) The Administrator shall approve or disapprove the control 
strategies submitted by any State pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section, not later than June 4, 1989. If a State fails to submit control 
strategies in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section or the 
Administrator does not approve the control strategies submitted by such 
State in accordance with paragraph (a), then, not later than June 4, 
1990, the Administrator in cooperation with such State and after notice 
and opportunity for public comment, shall implement the requirements of 
CWA section 304(l)(1) in such State. In the implementation of such 
requirements, the Administrator shall, at a minimum, consider for 
listing under CWA section 304(l)(1) any navigable waters for which any 
person submits a petition to the Administrator for listing not later 
than October 1, 1989.
    (c) For the purposes of this section the term individual control 
strategy, as set forth in section 304(l) of the CWA, means a final NPDES 
permit with supporting documentation showing that effluent limits are 
consistent with an approved wasteload allocation, or other documentation 
which shows that applicable water quality standards will be met not 
later than three years after the individual control strategy is 
established. Where a State is unable to issue a final permit on or 
before February 4, 1989, an individual control strategy may be a draft 
permit with an attached schedule (provided the State meets the schedule 
for issuing the final permit) indicating that the permit will be issued 
on or before February 4, 1990. If a point source is subject to section 
304(l)(1)(C) of the CWA and is also subject to an on-site response 
action under sections 104 or 106 of the Comprehensive Environmental 
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), (42 U.S.C. 
9601 et seq.), an individual control strategy may be the decision

applicable criteria set forth in section 304(l) of the CWA, and in 40 
CFR part 122, including Sec. 122.44(d). At any time after the Regional 
Administrator disapproves an ICS (or conditionally aproves a draft 
permit as an ICS), the Regional Office may submit a written notification 
to the State that the Regional Office intends to issue the ICS. Upon 
mailing the notification, and notwithstanding any other regulation,

program based on the requirements of this part and of CWA and taking 
into consideration all comments received. A responsiveness summary shall 
be prepared by the Regional Office which identifies the public 
participation activities conducted, describes the matters presented to 
the public, summarizes significant comments received and explains the 
Agency's response to these comments.
    (c) If the Administrator approves the State's program he or she 
shall notify the State and publish notice in the

[[Page 483]]

Federal Register. The Regional Administrator shall suspend the issuance 
of permits by EPA as of the date of program approval.

<R05>
Sec. 123.62  Procedures for revision of State programs.

    (a) Either EPA or the approved State may initiate program revision. 
Program revision may be necessary when the controlling Federal or State 
statutory or regulatory authority is modified or supplemented. The State 
shall keep EPA fully informed of any proposed modifications to its basic 
statutory or regulatory authority, its forms, procedures, or priorities. 
Grounds for program revision include cases where a State's existing 
approved program includes authority to issue NPDES permits for 
activities on a Federal Indian reservation and an Indian Tribe has 
subsequently been approved for assumption of the NPDES program under 40 
CFR part 123 extending to those lands.
    (b) Revision of a State program shall be accomplished as follows:
    (1) The State shall submit a modified program description, Attorney 
General's statement, Memorandum of Agreement, or such other documents as 
EPA determines to be necessary under the circumstances.
    (2) Whenever EPA determines that the proposed program revision is 
substantial, EPA shall issue public notice and provide an opportunity to 
comment for a period of at least 30 days. The public notice shall be 
mailed to interested persons and shall be published in the Federal 
Register and in enough of the largest newspapers in the State to provide 
Statewide coverage. The public notice shall summarize the proposed 
revisions and provide for the opportunity to request a public hearing. 
Such a hearing will be held if there is significant public interest 
based on requests received.
    (3) The Administrator shall approve or disapprove program revisions 
based on the requirements of this part and of the CWA.
    (4) A program revision shall become effective upon the approval of 
the Administrator. Notice of approval of any substantial revision shall 
be published in the Federal Register. Notice of approval of non-
substantial program revisions may be given by a letter from the 
Administrator to the State Governor or his designee.
    (c) States with approved programs shall notify EPA whenever they 
propose to transfer all or part of any program from the approved State 
agency to any other State agency, and shall identify any new division of 
responsibilities among the agencies involved. The new agency is not 
authorized to administer the program until approved by the Administrator 
under paragraph (b) of this section. Organizational charts required 
under Sec. 123.22(b) shall be revised and resubmitted.
    (d) Whenever the Administrator has reason to believe that 
circumstances have changed with respect to a State program, he may 
request, and the State shall provide, a supplemental Attorney General's 
statement, program description, or such other documents or information 
as are necessary.
    (e) State NPDES programs only. All new programs must comply with 
these regulations immediately upon approval. Any approved State section 
402 permit program which requires revision to conform to this part shall 
be so revised within one year of the date of promulgation of these 
regulations, unless a State must amend or enact a statute in order to 
make the required revision in which case such revision shall take place 
within 2 years, except that revision of State programs to implement the 
requirements of 40 CFR part 403 (pretreatment) shall be accomplished as 
provided in 40 CFR 403.10. In addition, approved States shall submit, 
within 6 months, copies of their permit forms for EPA review and 
approval. Approved States shall also assure that permit applicants, 
other than POTWs, submit, as part of their application, the information 
required under Secs. 124.4(d) and 122.21 (g) or (h), as appropriate.

    (f) Revision of a State program by a Great Lakes State or Tribe (as 
defined in 40 CFR 132.2) to conform to section 118 of the CWA and 40 CFR 
part 132 shall be accomplished pursuant to 40 CFR part 132.

<R05>
Sec. 123.64  Procedures for withdrawal of State programs.

    (a) A State with a program approved under this part may voluntarily 
transfer program responsibilities required by Federal law to EPA by 
taking the following actions, or in such other manner as may be agreed 
upon with the Administrator.
    (1) The State shall give the Administrator 180 days notice of the 
proposed transfer and shall submit a plan for the orderly transfer of 
all relevant program information not in the possession of EPA (such as 
permits, permit files, compliance files, reports, permit applications) 
which are necessary for EPA to administer the program.
    (2) Within 60 days of receiving the notice and transfer plan, the 
Administrator shall evaluate the State's transfer plan and shall 
identify any additional information needed by the Federal government for 
program administration and/or identify any other deficiencies in the 
plan.
    (3) At least 30 days before the transfer is to occur the 
Administrator shall publish notice of the transfer in the Federal 
Register and in enough of the largest newspapers in the State to provide 
Statewide coverage, and shall mail notice to all permit holders, permit 
applicants, other regulated persons and other interested persons on 
appropriate EPA and State mailing lists.
    (b) The following procedures apply when the Administrator orders the 
commencement of proceedings to determine whether to withdraw approval of 
a State program.
    (1) Order. The Administrator may order the commencement of 
withdrawal proceedings on his or her own initiative or in response to a 
petition

[[Page 485]]

from an interested person alleging failure of the State to comply with 
the requirements of this part as set forth in Sec. 123.63. The 
Administrator shall respond in writing to any petition to commence 
withdrawal proceedings. He may conduct an informal investigation of the 
allegations in the petition to determine whether cause exists to 
commence proceedings under this paragraph. The Administrator's order 
commencing proceedings under this paragraph shall fix a time and place 
for the commencement of the hearing and shall specify the allegations 
against the State which are to be considered at the hearing. Within 30 
days the State shall admit or deny these allegations in a written 
answer. The party seeking withdrawal of the State's program shall have 
the burden of coming forward with the evidence in a hearing under this 
paragraph.
    (2) Definitions. For purposes of this paragraph the definitions of 
``Act,'' ``Administrative Law Judge,'' ``Hearing Clerk,'' and 
``Presiding Officer'' in 40 CFR 22.03 apply in addition to the 
following:
    (i) Party means the petitioner, the State, the Agency, and any other 
person whose request to participate as a party is granted.
    (ii) Person means the Agency, the State and any individual or 
organization having an interest in the subject matter of the proceeding.
    (iii) Petitioner means any person whose petition for commencement of 
withdrawal proceedings has been granted by the Administrator.
    (3) Procedures. (i) The following provisions of 40 CFR part 22 
(Consolidated Rules of Practice) are applicable to proceedings under 
this paragraph:
    (A) Sec. 22.02--(use of number/gender);
    (B) Sec. 22.04(c)--(authorities of Presiding Officer);
    (C) Sec. 22.06--(filing/service of rulings and orders);
    (D) Sec. 22.09--(examination of filed documents);
    (E) Sec. 22.19(a), (b) and (c)--(prehearing conference);
    (F) Sec. 22.22--(evidence);
    (G) Sec. 22.23--(objections/offers of proof);
    (H) Sec. 22.25--(filing the transcript); and
    (I) Sec. 22.26--(findings/conclusions).
    (ii) The following provisions are also applicable:
    (A) Computation and extension of time--(1) Computation. In computing 
any period of time prescribed or allowed in these rules of practice, 
except as otherwise provided, the day of the event from which the 
designated period begins to run shall not be included. Saturdays, 
Sundays, and Federal legal holidays shall be included. When a stated 
time expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the stated time 
period shall be extended to include the next business day.
    (2) Extensions of time. The Administrator, Regional Administrator, 
or Presiding Officer, as appropriate, may grant an extension of time for 
the filing of any pleading, document, or motion (i) upon timely motion 
of a party to the proceeding, for good cause shown, and after 
consideration of prejudice to other parties, or (ii) upon his own 
motion. Such a motion by a party may only be made after notice to all 
other parties, unless the movant can show good cause why serving notice 
is impracticable. The motion shall be filed in advance of the date on 
which the pleading, document or motion is due to be filed, unless the 
failure of a party to make timely motion for extension of time was the 
result of excusable neglect.
    (3) The time for commencement of the hearing shall not be extended 
beyond the date set in the Administrator's order without approval of the 
Administrator.
    (B) Ex parte discussion of proceedings. At no time after the 
issuance of the order commencing proceedings shall the Administrator, 
the Regional Administrator, the Regional Judicial Officer, the Presiding 
Officer, or any other person who is likely to advise these officials in 
the decision on the case, discuss ex parte the merits of the proceeding 
with any interested person outside the Agency, with any Agency staff 
member who performs a prosecutorial or investigative function in such 
proceeding or a factually related proceeding, or with any representative 
of such person. Any ex parte memorandum or other communication addressed 
to the Administrator, the Regional Administrator, the Regional Judicial 
Officer, or

[[Page 486]]

the Presiding Officer during the pendency of the proceeding and relating 
to the merits thereof, by or on behalf of any party, shall be regarded 
as argument made in the proceeding and shall be served upon all other 
parties. The other parties shall be given an opportunity to reply to 
such memorandum or communication.
    (C) Intervention--(1) Motion. A motion for leave to intervene in any 
proceeding conducted under these rules of practice must set forth the 
grounds for the proposed intervention, the position and interest of the 
movant and the likely impact that intervention will have on the 
expeditious progress of the proceeding. Any person already a party to 
the proceeding may file an answer to a motion to intervene, making 
specific reference to the factors set forth in the foregoing sentence 
and paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C)(3) of this section, within ten (10) days 
after service of the motion for leave to intervene.
    (2) However, motions to intervene must be filed within 15 days from 
the date the notice of the Administrator's order is first published.
    (3) Disposition. Leave to intervene may be granted only if the 
movant demonstrates that (i) his presence in the proceeding would not 
unduly prolong or otherwise prejudice that adjudication of the rights of 
the original parties; (ii) the movant will be adversely affected by a 
final order; and (iii) the interests of the movant are not being 
adequately represented by the original parties. The intervenor shall 
become a full party to the proceeding upon the granting of leave to 
intervene.
    (4) Amicus curiae. Persons not parties to the proceeding who wish to 
file briefs may so move. The motion shall identify the interest of the 
applicant and shall state the reasons why the proposed amicus brief is 
desirable. If the motion is granted, the Presiding Officer or 
Administrator shall issue an order setting the time for filing such 
brief. An amicus curiae is eligible to participate in any briefing after 
his motion is granted, and shall be served with all briefs, reply 
briefs, motions, and orders relating to issues to be briefed.
    (D) Motions--(1) General. All motions, except those made orally on 
the record during a hearing, shall (i) be in writing; (ii) state the 
grounds therefor with particularity; (iii) set forth the relief or order 
sought; and (iv) be accompanied by any affidavit, certificate, other 
evidence, or legal memorandum relied upon. Such motions shall be served 
as provided by paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (2) Response to motions. A party's response to any written motion 
must be filed within ten (10) days after service of such motion, unless 
additional time is allowed for such response. The response shall be 
accompanied by any affidavit, certificate, other evidence, or legal 
memorandum relied upon. If no response is filed within the designated 
period, the parties may be deemed to have waived any objection to the 
granting of the motion. The Presiding Officer, Regional Administrator, 
or Administrator, as appropriate, may set a shorter time for response, 
or make such other orders concerning the disposition of motions as they 
deem appropriate.
    (3) Decision. The Administrator shall rule on all motions filed or 
made after service of the recommended decision upon the parties. The 
Presiding Officer shall rule on all other motions. Oral argument on 
motions will be permitted where the Presiding Officer, Regional 
Administrator, or the Administrator considers it necessary or desirable.
    (4) Record of proceedings. (i) The hearing shall be either 
stenographically reported verbatim or tape recorded, and thereupon 
transcribed by an official reporter designated by the Presiding Officer;
    (ii) All orders issued by the Presiding Officer, transcripts of 
testimony, written statements of position, stipulations, exhibits, 
motions, briefs, and other written material of any kind submitted in the 
hearing shall be a part of the record and shall be available for 
inspection or copying in the Office of the Hearing Clerk, upon payment 
of costs. Inquiries may be made at the Office of the Administrative Law 
Judges, Hearing Clerk, 401 M Street, SW, Washington, DC 20460;

[[Page 487]]

    (iii) Upon notice to all parties the Presiding Officer may authorize 
corrections to the transcript which involves matters of substance;
    (iv) An original and two (2) copies of all written submissions to 
the hearing shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk;
    (v) A copy of each submission shall be served by the person making 
the submission upon the Presiding Officer and each party of record. 
Service under this paragraph shall take place by mail or personal 
delivery;
    (vi) Every submission shall be accompanied by an acknowledgement of 
service by the person served or proof of service in the form of a 
statement of the date, time, and manner of service and the names of the 
persons served, certified by the person who made service, and;
    (vii) The Hearing Clerk shall maintain and furnish to any person 
upon request, a list containing the name, service address, and telephone 
number of all parties and their attorneys or duly authorized 
representatives.
    (5) Participation by a person not a party. A person who is not a 
party may, in the discretion of the Presiding Officer, be permitted to 
make a limited appearance by making oral or written statement of his/her 
position on the issues within such limits and on such conditions as may 
be fixed by the Presiding Officer, but he/she may not otherwise 
participate in the proceeding.
    (6) Rights of parties. (i) All parties to the proceeding may:
    (A) Appear by counsel or other representative in all hearing and 
pre-hearing proceedings;
    (B) Agree to stipulations of facts which shall be made a part of the 
record.
    (7) Recommended decision. (i) Within 30 days after the filing of 
proposed findings and conclusions, and reply briefs, the Presiding 
Officer shall evaluate the record before him/her, the proposed findings 
and conclusions and any briefs filed by the parties and shall prepare a 
recommended decision, and shall certify the entire record, including the 
recommended decision, to the Administrator.
    (ii) Copies of the recommended decision shall be served upon all 
parties.
    (iii) Within 20 days after the certification and filing of the 
record and recommended decision, all parties may file with the 
Administrator exceptions to the recommended decision and a supporting 
brief.
    (8) Decision by Administrator. (i) Within 60 days after the 
certification of the record and filing of the Presiding Officer's 
recommeded decision, the Administrator shall review the record before 
him and issue his own decision.
    (ii) If the Administrator concludes that the State has administered 
the program in conformity with the appropriate Act and regulations his 
decision shall constitute ``final agency action'' within the meaning of 
5 U.S.C. 704.
    (iii) If the Administrator concludes that the State has not 
administered the program in conformity with the appropriate Act and 
regulations he shall list the deficiencies in the program and provide 
the State a reasonable time, not to exceed 90 days, to take such 
appropriate corrective action as the Administrator determines necessary.
    (iv) Within the time prescribed by the Administrator the State shall 
take such appropriate corrective action as required by the Administrator 
and shall file with the Administrator and all parties a statement 
certified by the State Director that such appropriate corrective action 
has been taken.
    (v) The Administrator may require a further showing in addition to 
the certified statement that corrective action has been taken.
    (vi) If the State fails to take such appropriate corrective action 
and file a certified statement thereof within the time prescribed by the 
Administrator, the Administrator shall issue a supplementary order 
withdrawing approval of the State program. If the State takes such 
appropriate corrective action, the Administrator shall issue a 
supplementary order stating that approval of authority is not withdrawn.
    (vii) The Administrator's supplementary order shall constitute final 
Agency action within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 704.
    (viii) Withdrawal of authorization under this section and the 
appropriate Act does not relieve any person from complying with the 
requirements of

[[Page 488]]

State law, nor does it affect the validity of actions by the State prior 
to withdrawal.

                 Subpart A--General Program Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 124.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This part contains EPA procedures for issuing, modifying, 
revoking and reissuing, or terminating all RCRA, UIC, PSD and NPDES 
``permits'' (including ``sludge-only'' permits issued pursuant to 
Sec. 122.1(b)(3)), other than RCRA and UIC ``emergency permits'' (see 
Secs. 270.61 and 144.34) and RCRA ``permits by rule'' (Sec. 270.60). The 
latter kinds of permits are governed by part 270. RCRA interim status 
and UIC authorization by rule are not ``permits'' and are covered by 
specific provisions in parts 144, subpart C, and 270. This part also 
does not apply to permits issued, modified, revoked and reissued or 
terminated by the Corps of Engineers. Those procedures are specified in 
33 CFR parts 320-327. The procedures of this part also apply to denial 
of a permit for the active life of a RCRA hazardous waste management 
facility or unit under Sec. 270.29.
    (b) Part 124 is organized into six subparts. Subpart A contains 
general procedural requirements applicable to all permit programs 
covered by these regulations. Subparts B through F supplement these 
general provisions with requirements that apply to only one or more of 
the programs. Subpart A describes the steps EPA will follow in receiving 
permit applications, preparing draft permits, issuing public notice, 
inviting public comment and holding public hearings on draft permits. 
Subpart A also covers assembling an administrative record, responding to 
comments, issuing a final permit decision, and allowing for 
administrative appeal of the final permit decision. Subpart B is 
reserved for specific procedural requirements for RCRA permits. There 
are none of these at present but they may be added in the future. 
Subpart C contains definitions and specific procedural requirements for 
PSD permits. Subpart D applies to NPDES permits until an evidentiary 
hearing begins, when subpart E procedures take over for EPA-issued NPDES 
permits and EPA-terminated RCRA permits. Subpart F, which is based on 
the ``initial licensing'' provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act 
(APA), can be used instead of subparts A through E in appropriate cases.
    (c) Part 124 offers an opportunity for three kinds of hearings: A 
public hearing under subpart A, an evidentiary hearing under subpart E, 
and a panel hearing under subpart F. This chart describes when these 
hearings are available for each of the five permit programs.

                                       Hearings Available Under This Part

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) This part is designed to allow permits for a given facility 
under two or more of the listed programs to be processed separately or 
together at the choice of the Regional Administrator. This allows EPA to 
combine the processing of permits only when appropriate, and not 
necessarily in all cases. The Regional Administrator may consolidate 
permit processing when the permit applications are submitted, when draft 
permits are prepared, or when final permit decisions are issued. This 
part also allows consolidated permits to be subject to a single public 
hearing under Sec. 124.12, a single evidentiary hearing under 
Sec. 124.75, or a single non-adversary panel hearing under Sec. 124.120. 
Permit applicants may recommend whether or not their applications should 
be consolidated in any given case.
    (e) Certain procedural requirements set forth in part 124 must be 
adopted by States in order to gain EPA approval to operate RCRA, UIC, 
NPDES, and 404 permit programs. These requirements are listed in 
Secs. 123.25 (NPDES), 145.11 (UIC), 233,26 (404), and 271.14 (RCRA) and 
signaled by the following words at the end of the appropriate part 124 
section or paragraph heading: (applicable to State programs see 
Secs. 123.25 (NPDES), 145.11 (UIC), 233.26 (404), and 271.14 (RCRA)). 
Part 124 does not apply to PSD permits issued by an approved State.
    (f) To coordinate decisionmaking when different permits will be 
issued by EPA and approved State programs, this part allows applications 
to be jointly processed, joint comment periods and hearings to be held, 
and final permits to be issued on a cooperative basis whenever EPA and a 
State agree to take such steps in general or in individual cases. These 
joint processing agreements may be provided in the Memorandum of 
Agreement developed under Secs. 123.24 (NPDES), 145.24 (UIC), 233.24 
(404), and 271.8 (RCRA).

<R05>
Sec. 124.2  Definitions.

    (a) In addition to the definitions given in Secs. 122.2 and 123.2 
(NPDES), 501.2 (sludge management), 144.3 and 145.2 (UIC), 233.3 (404), 
and 270.2 and 271.2 (RCRA), the definitions below apply to this part, 
except for PSD permits which are governed by the definitions in 
Sec. 124.41. Terms not defined in this section have the meaning given by 
the appropriate Act.
    Administrator means the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, or an authorized representative.
    Applicable standards and limitations means all State, interstate, 
and federal standards and limitations to which a ``discharge,'' a 
``sludge use or disposal practice'' or a related activity is subject 
under the CWA, including ``standards for sewage sludge use or 
disposal,'' ``effluent limitations,'' water quality standards, standards 
of performance, toxic effluent standards or prohibitions, ``best 
management practices,'' and pretreatment standards under sections 301, 
302, 303, 304, 306, 307, 308, 403, and 405 of CWA.
    Application means the EPA standard national forms for applying for a 
permit, including any additions, revisions or modifications to the 
forms; or forms approved by EPA for use in ``approved States,'' 
including any approved modifications or revisions. For RCRA, application 
also includes the information required by the Director under 
Secs. 270.14 through 270.29 [contents of Part B of the RCRA 
application].
    Appropriate Act and regulations means the Clean Water Act (CWA); the 
Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation 
Recovery Act (RCRA); or Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), whichever is 
applicable; and applicable regulations promulgated under those statutes. 
In the case of an ``approved State program'' appropriate Act and 
regulations includes program requirements.
    Consultation with the Regional Administrator (Sec. 124.62(a)(2)) 
means review by the Regional Administrator following evaluation by a 
panel of the technical merits of all 301(k) applications approved by the 
Director. The panel (to be appointed by the Director of the Office of 
Water Enforcement and Permits) will consist of Headquarters, Regional, 
and State personnel familiar with the industrial category in question.
    CWA means the Clean Water Act (formerly referred to as the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act of Federal Pollution Control Act Amendments 
of 1972) Public Law 92-500, as amended by Public Law 95-217 and Public 
Law 95-576; 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.
    Director means the Regional Administrator, the State director or the 
Tribal director as the context requires, or an authorized 
representative. When there is no approved State or Tribal program, and 
there is an EPA administered program, Director means the Regional 
Administrator. When there is an approved State or Tribal program, 
``Director'' normally means the State or Tribal director. In some 
circumstances, however, EPA retains the authority to take certain 
actions even when there is an approved State or Tribal program. (For 
example, when EPA has issued an NPDES permit prior to the approval of a 
State program, EPA may retain jurisdiction over that permit after 
program approval; see Sec. 123.1) In such cases, the term ``Director'' 
means the Regional Administrator and not the State or Tribal director.
    Draft permit means a document prepared under Sec. 124.6 indicating 
the Director's tentative decision to issue or deny, modify, revoke and 
reissue, terminate, or reissue a ``permit.'' A notice of intent to 
terminate a permit and a notice of intent to deny a permit as discussed 
in Sec. 124.5, are types of ``draft permits.'' A denial of a request for 
modification, revocation and reissuance or termination, as discussed in 
Sec. 124.5, is not a ``draft permit.'' A ``proposal permit'' is not a 
``draft permit.''
    Environmental Appeals Board shall mean the Board within the Agency 
described in Sec. 1.25(e) of this title. The Administrator delegates 
authority to the Environmental Appeals Board to issue final decisions in 
RCRA, PSD, UIC, or NPDES permit appeals filed under this subpart, 
including informal appeals of denials of requests for modification, 
revocation and reissuance, or termination of permits under Section

[[Page 492]]

124.5(b). An appeal directed to the Administrator, rather than to the 
Environmental Appeals Board, will not be considered. This delegation 
does not preclude the Environmental Appeals Board from referring an 
appeal or a motion under this subpart to the Administrator when the 
Environmental Appeals Board, in its discretion, deems it appropriate to 
do so. When an appeal or motion is referred to the Administrator by the 
Environmental Appeals Board, all parties shall be so notified and the 
rules in this subpart referring to the Environmental Appeals Board shall 
be interpreted as referring to the Administrator.

Sec. 124.3  Application for a permit.

    (a) Applicable to State programs, see Secs. 123.25 (NPDES), 145.11 
(UIC), 233.26 (404), and 271.14 (RCRA). (1) Any person who requires a 
permit under the RCRA, UIC, NPDES, or PSD programs shall complete, sign, 
and submit to the Director an application for each permit required under 
Secs. 270.1 (RCRA), 144.1 (UIC), 40 CFR 52.21 (PSD), and 122.1 (NPDES). 
Applications are not required for RCRA permits by rule (Sec. 270.60), 
underground injections authorized by rules (Secs. 144.21 through 
144.26), NPDES general permits (Sec. 122.28) and 404 general permits 
(Sec. 233.37).

[[Page 494]]

    (2) The Director shall not begin the processing of a permit until 
the applicant has fully complied with the application requirements for 
that permit. See Secs. 270.10, 270.13 (RCRA), 144.31 (UIC), 40 CFR 52.21 
(PSD), and 122.21 (NPDES).
    (3) Permit applications (except for PSD permits) must comply with 
the signature and certification requirements of Secs. 122.22 (NPDES), 
144.32 (UIC), 233.6 (404), and 270.11 (RCRA).
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) The Regional Administrator shall review for completeness every 
application for an EPA-issued permit. Each application for an EPA-issued 
permit submitted by a new HWM facility, a new UIC injection well, a 
major PSD stationary source or major PSD modification, or an NPDES new 
source or NPDES new discharger should be reviewed for completeness by 
the Regional Administrator within 30 days of its receipt. Each 
application for an EPA-issued permit submitted by an existing HWM 
facility (both Parts A and B of the application), existing injection 
well or existing NPDES source or sludge-only facility should be reviewed 
for completeness within 60 days of receipt. Upon completing the review, 
the Regional Administrator shall notify the applicant in writing whether 
the application is complete. If the application is incomplete, the 
Regional Administrator shall list the information necessary to make the 
application complete. When the application is for an existing HWM 
facility, an existing UIC injection well or an existing NPDES source or 
``sludge-only facility'' the Regional Administrator shall specify in the 
notice of deficiency a date for submitting the necessary information. 
The Regional Administrator shall notify the applicant that the 
application is complete upon receiving this information. After the 
application is completed, the Regional Administrator may request 
additional information from an applicant but only when necessary to 
clarify, modify, or supplement previously submitted material. Requests 
for such additional information will not render an application 
incomplete.
    (d) If an applicant fails or refuses to correct deficiencies in the 
application, the permit may be denied and appropriate enforcement 
actions may be taken under the applicable statutory provision including 
RCRA section 3008, SDWA sections 1423 and 1424, CAA section 167, and CWA 
sections 308, 309, 402(h), and 402(k).
    (e) If the Regional Administrator decides that a site visit is 
necessary for any reason in conjunction with the processing of an 
application, he or she shall notify the applicant and a date shall be 
scheduled.
    (f) The effective date of an application is the date on which the 
Regional Administrator notifies the applicant that the application is 
complete as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (g) For each application from a major new HWM facility, major new 
UIC injection well, major NPDES new source, major NPDES new discharger, 
or a permit to be issued under provisions of Sec. 122.28(c), the 
Regional Administrator shall, no later than the effective date of the 
application, prepare and mail to the applicant a project decision 
schedule. (This paragraph does not apply to PSD permits.) The schedule 
shall specify target dates by which the Regional Administrator intends 
to:
    (1) Prepare a draft permit;
    (2) Give public notice;
    (3) Complete the public comment period, including any public 
hearing;
    (4) Issue a final permit; and
    (5) In the case of an NPDES permit, complete any formal proceedings 
under subpart E or F.

Sec. 124.4

0  Consolidation of permit processing.

    (a)(1) Whenever a facility or activity requires a permit under more 
than one statute covered by these regulations, processing of two or more 
applications for those permits may be consolidated. The first step in 
consolidation is to prepare each draft permit at the same time.
    (2) Whenever draft permits are prepared at the same time, the 
statements

[[Page 495]]

of basis (required under Sec. 124.7 for EPA-issued permits only) or fact 
sheets (Sec. 124.8), administrative records (required under Sec. 124.9 
for EPA-issued permits only), public comment periods (Sec. 124.10), and 
any public hearings (Sec. 124.12) on those permits should also be 
consolidated. The final permits may be issued together. They need not be 
issued together if in the judgment of the Regional Administrator or 
State Director(s), joint processing would result in unreasonable delay 
in the issuance of one or more permits.
    (b) Whenever an existing facility or activity requires additional 
permits under one or more of the statutes covered by these regulations, 
the permitting authority may coordinate the expiration date(s) of the 
new permit(s) with the expiration date(s) of the existing permit(s) so 
that all permits expire simultaneously. Processing of the subsequent 
applications for renewal permits may then be consolidated.
    (c) Processing of permit applications under paragraph (a) or (b) of 
this section may be consolidated as follows:
    (1) The Director may consolidate permit processing at his or her 
discretion whenever a facility or activity requires all permits either 
from EPA or from an approved State.
    (2) The Regional Administrator and the State Director(s) may agree 
to consolidate draft permits whenever a facility or activity requires 
permits from both EPA and an approved State.
    (3) Permit applicants may recommend whether or not the processing of 
their applications should be consolidated.
    (d) Whenever permit processing is consolidated and the Regional 
Administrator invokes the ``initial licensing'' provisions of subpart F 
for an NPDES, RCRA, or UIC permit, any permit(s) with which that NPDES, 
RCRA or UIC permit was consolidated shall likewise be processed under 
subpart F.
    (e) Except with the written consent of the permit applicant, the 
Regional Administrator shall not consolidate processing a PSD permit 
with any other permit under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section or 
process a PSD permit under subpart F as provided in paragraph (d) of 
this section when to do so would delay issuance of the PSD permit more 
than one year from the effective date of the application under 
Sec. 124.3(f).


<R05>
Sec. 124.5  Modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination of permits.

    (a) (Applicable to State programs, see Secs. 123.25 (NPDES), 145.11 
(UIC), 233.26 (404), and 271.14 (RCRA)). Permits (other than PSD 
permits) may be modified, revoked and reissued, or terminated either at 
the request of any interested person (including the permittee) or upon 
the Director's initiative. However, permits may only be modified, 
revoked and reissued, or terminated for the reasons specified in 
Sec. 122.62 or Sec. 122.64 (NPDES), 144.39 or 144.40 (UIC), 233.14 or 
233.15 (404), and 270.41 or 270.43 (RCRA). All requests shall be in 
writing and shall contain facts or reasons supporting the request.
    (b) If the Director decides the request is not justified, he or she 
shall send the requester a brief written response giving a reason for 
the decision. Denials of requests for modification, revocation and 
reissuance, or termination are not subject to public notice, comment, or 
hearings. Denials by the Regional Administrator may be informally 
appealed to the Environmental Appeals Board by a letter briefly setting 
forth the relevant facts. The Environmental Appeals Board may direct the 
Regional Administrator to begin modification, revocation and reissuance, 
or termination proceedings under paragraph (c) of this section. The 
appeal shall be considered denied if the Environmental Appeals Board 
takes no action on the letter within 60 days after receiving it. This 
informal appeal is, under 5 U.S.C. 704, a prerequisite to seeking 
judicial review of EPA action in denying a request for modification, 
revocation and reissuance, or termination.
    (c) (Applicable to State programs, see Secs. 123.25 (NPDES), 145.11 
(UIC), 233.26 (404), and 271.14 (RCRA)). (1) If the Director tentatively 
decides to modify or revoke and reissue a permit under Secs. 122.62 
(NPDES), 144.39 (UIC), 233.14 (404), or 270.41 or 270.42(c) (RCRA), he 
or she shall prepare a draft permit under Sec. 124.6 incorporating the 
proposed changes. The Director may request additional information and, 
in the case of

[[Page 496]]

a modified permit, may require the submission of an updated application. 
In the case of revoked and reissued permits, the Director shall require 
the submission of a new application.
    (2) In a permit modification under this section, only those 
conditions to be modified shall be reopened when a new draft permit is 
prepared. All other aspects of the existing permit shall remain in 
effect for the duration of the unmodified permit. When a permit is 
revoked and reissued under this section, the entire permit is reopened 
just as if the permit had expired and was being reissued. During any 
revocation and reissuance proceeding the permittee shall comply with all 
conditions of the existing permit until a new final permit is reissued.
    (3) ``Minor modifications'' as defined in Secs. 122.63 (NPDES), 
144.41 (UIC), and 233.16 (404), and ``Classes 1 and 2 modifications'' as 
defined in Sec. 270.42 (a) and (b) (RCRA) are not subject to the 
requirements of this section.
    (d) (Applicable to State programs, see Secs. 123.25 (NPDES), 145.11 
(UIC), 233.26 (404), and 271.14 (RCRA)). If the Director tentatively 
decides to terminate a permit under Secs. 122.64 (NDPES), 144.40 (UIC), 
233.15 (404), or 270.43 (RCRA), he or she shall issue a notice of intent 
to terminate. A notice of intent to terminate is a type of draft permit 
which follows the same procedures as any draft permit prepared under 
Sec. 124.6. In the case of EPA-issued permits, a notice of intent to 
terminate shall not be issued if the Regional Administrator and the 
permittee agree to termination in the course of transferring permit 
responsibility to an approved State under Secs. 123.24(b)(1) (NPDES), 
145.24(b)(1) (UIC), 271.8(b)(6) (RCRA), or 501.14(b)(1) (Sludge).
    (e) When EPA is the permitting authority, all draft permits 
(including notices of intent to terminate) prepared under this section 
shall be based on the administrative record as defined in Sec. 124.9.
    (f) (Applicable to State programs, see Sec. 233.26 (404)). Any 
request by the permittee for modification to an existing 404 permit 
(other than a request for a minor modification as defined in Sec. 233.16 
(404)) shall be treated as a permit application and shall be processed 
in accordance with all requirements of Sec. 124.3.
    (g)(1) (Reserved for PSD Modification Provisions).
    (2) PSD permits may be terminated only by rescission under 
Sec. 52.21(w) or by automatic expiration under Sec. 52.21(r). 
Applications for rescission shall be precessed under Sec. 52.21(w) and 
are not subject to this part.

Sec. 124.6  Draft permits.

    (a) (Applicable to State programs, see Secs. 123.25 (NPDES), 145.11 
(UIC), 233.26 (404), and 271.14 (RCRA).) Once an application is 
complete, the Director shall tentatively decide whether to prepare a 
draft permit (except in the case of State section 404 permits for which 
no draft permit is required under Sec. 233.39) or to deny the 
application.
    (b) If the Director tentatively decides to deny the permit 
application, he or she shall issue a notice of intent to deny. A notice 
of intent to deny the permit application is a type of draft permit which 
follows the same procedures as any draft permit prepared under this 
section. See Sec. 124.6(e). If the Director's final decision 
(Sec. 124.15) is that the tentative decision to deny the permit 
application was incorrect, he or she shall withdraw the notice of intent 
to deny and proceed to prepare a draft permit under paragraph (d) of 
this section.

conditions certified by a State agency under Sec. 124.55, and all 
variances that are to be included under Sec. 124.63.
    (e) (Applicable to State programs, see Secs. 123.25 (NPDES), 145.11 
(UIC), 233.26 (404), and 271.14 (RCRA).) All draft permits prepared by 
EPA under this section shall be accompanied by a statement of basis 
(Sec. 124.7) or fact sheet (Sec. 124.8), and shall be based on the 
administrative record (Sec. 124.9), publicly noticed (Sec. 124.10) and 
made available for public comment (Sec. 124.11). The Regional 
Administrator shall give notice of opportunity for a public hearing 
(Sec. 124.12), issue a final decision (Sec. 124.15) and respond to 
comments (Sec. 124.17). For RCRA, UIC or PSD permits, an appeal may be 
taken under Sec. 124.19 and, for NPDES permits, an appeal may be taken

need not be physically included with the rest of the record as long as 
it is specifically referred to in the statement of basis or the fact 
sheet.
    (d) This section applies to all draft permits when public notice was 
given after the effective date of these regulations.

Sec. 124.11  Public comments and requests for public hearings.

    (Applicable to State programs, see Secs. 123.25 (NPDES), 145.11 
(UIC), 233.26 (404), and 271.14 (RCRA)). During the public comment 
period provided under Sec. 124.10, any interested person may submit 
written comments on the draft permit or the permit application for 404 
permits when no draft permit is required (see Sec. 233.39) and may 
request a public hearing, if no hearing has already been scheduled. A 
request for a public hearing shall be in writing and shall state the 
nature of the issues proposed to be raised in the hearing. All comments 
shall be considered in making the final decision and shall be answered 
as provided in Sec. 124.17.

Sec. 124.12  Public hearings.

    (a) (Applicable to State programs, see Secs. 123.25 (NPDES), 145.11 
(UIC), 233.26 (404), and 271.14 (RCRA).) (1) The Director shall hold a 
public hearing whenever he or she finds, on the basis of requests, a 
significant degree of public interest in a draft permit(s);
    (2) The Director may also hold a public hearing at his or her 
discretion, whenever, for instance, such a hearing might clarify one or 
more issues involved in the permit decision;
    (3) For RCRA permits only, (i) the Director shall hold a public 
hearing whenever he or she receives written notice of opposition to a 
draft permit and a request for a hearing within 45 days of public notice 
under Sec. 124.10(b)(1); (ii) whenever possible the Director shall 
schedule a hearing under this section at a location convenient to the 
nearest population center to the proposed facility;
    (4) Public notice of the hearing shall be given as specified in 
Sec. 124.10.
    (b) Whenever a public hearing will be held and EPA is the permitting 
authority, the Regional Administrator shall designate a Presiding 
Officer for the hearing who shall be responsible for its scheduling and 
orderly conduct.
    (c) Any person may submit oral or written statements and data 
concerning the draft permit. Reasonable limits may be set upon the time 
allowed for oral statements, and the submission of statements in writing 
may be required. The public comment period under Sec. 124.10 shall 
automatically be extended to the close of any public hearing under this 
section. The hearing officer may also extend the comment period by so 
stating at the hearing.
    (d) A tape recording or written transcript of the hearing shall be 
made available to the public.
    (e)(1) At his or her discretion, the Regional Administrator may 
specify that RCRA or UIC permits be processed under the procedures in

Regional Administrator shall have the discretion to provide a hearing 
under the procedures in subpart F. The permit applicant may request such 
a hearing pursuant to Sec. 124.114 no one or more issues, if the 
applicant explains in his request why he or she believes those issues:
    (i) Are genuine issues to material fact; and (ii) determine the 
outcome of one or more contested permit conditions identified as such in 
the applicant's request, that would require extensive changes to the 
facility (``contested major permit conditions''). If the Regional 
Administrator decides to deny the request, he or she shall send to the 
applicant a brief written statement of his or her reasons for concluding 
that no such determinative issues

[[Page 502]]

have been presented for resolution in such a hearing.

<R05>
Sec. 124.13  Obligation to raise issues and provide information during the public comment period.

    All persons, including applicants, who believe any condition of a 
draft permit is inappropriate or that the Director's tentative decision 
to deny an application, terminate a permit, or prepare a draft permit is 
inappropriate, must raise all reasonably ascertainable issues and submit 
all reasonably available arguments supporting their position by the 
close of the public comment period (including any public hearing) under 
Sec. 124.10. Any supporting materials which are submitted shall be 
included in full and may not be incorporated by reference, unless they 
are already part of the administrative record in the same proceeding, or 
consist of State or Federal statutes and regulations, EPA documents of 
general applicability, or other generally available reference materials. 
Commenters shall make supporting materials not already included in the 
administrative record available to EPA as directed by the Regional 
Administrator. (A comment period longer than 30 days may be necessary to 
give commenters a reasonable opportunity to comply with the requirements 
of this section. Additional time shall be granted under Sec. 124.10 to 
the extent that a commenter who requests additional time demonstrates 
the need for such time.)

[49 FR 38051, Sept. 26, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 124.14  Reopening of the public comment period.

    (a)(1) The Regional Administrator may order the public comment 
period reopened if the procedures of this paragraph could expedite the 
decisionmaking process. When the public comment period is reopened under 
this paragraph, all persons, including applicants, who believe any 
condition of a draft permit is inappropriate or that the Regional 
Administrator's tentative decision to deny an application, terminate a 
permit, or prepare a draft permit is inappropriate, must submit all 
reasonably available factual grounds supporting their position, 
including all supporting material, by a date, not less than sixty days 
after public notice under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, set by the 
Regional Administrator. Thereafter, any person may file a written 
response to the material filed by any other person, by a date, not less 
than twenty days after the date set for filing of the material, set by 
the Regional Administrator.
    (2) Public notice of any comment period under this paragraph shall 
identify the issues to which the requirements of Sec. 124.14(a) shall 
apply.
    (3) On his own motion or on the request of any person, the Regional 
Administrator may direct that the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section shall apply during the initial comment period where it 
reasonably appears that issuance of the permit will be contested and 
that applying the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section will 
substantially expedite the decisionmaking process. The notice of the 
draft permit shall state whenever this has been done.
    (4) A comment period of longer than 60 days will often be necessary 
in complicated proceedings to give commenters a reasonable opportunity 
to comply with the requirements of this section. Commenters may request 
longer comment periods and they shall be granted under Sec. 124.10 to 
the extent they appear necessary.
    (b) If any data information or arguments submitted during the public 
comment period, including information or arguments required under 
Sec. 124.13, appear to raise substantial new questions concerning a 
permit, the Regional Administrator may take one or more of the following 
actions:
    (1) Prepare a new draft permit, appropriately modified, under 
Sec. 124.6;
    (2) Prepare a revised statement of basis under Sec. 124.7, a fact 
sheet or revised fact sheet under Sec. 124.8 and reopen the comment 
period under Sec. 124.14; or
    (3) Reopen or extend the comment period under Sec. 124.10 to give 
interested persons an opportunity to comment on the information or 
arguments submitted.

[[Page 503]]

    (c) Comments filed during the reopened comment period shall be 
limited to the substantial new questions that caused its reopening. The 
public notice under Sec. 124.10 shall define the scope of the reopening.
    (d) For RCRA, UIC, or NPDES permits, the Regional Administrator may 
also, in the circumstances described above, elect to hold further 
proceedings under subpart F. This decision may be combined with any of 
the actions enumerated in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) Public notice of any of the above actions shall be issued under 
Sec. 124.10.

<R05>
Sec. 124.15  Issuance and effective date of permit.

    (a) After the close of the public comment period under Sec. 124.10 
on a draft permit, the Regional Administrator shall issue a final permit 
decision (or a decision to deny a permit for the active life of a RCRA 
hazardous waste management facility or unit under Sec. 270.29). The 
Regional Administrator shall notify the applicant and each person who 
has submitted written comments or requested notice of the final permit 
decision. This notice shall include reference to the procedures for 
appealing a decision on a RCRA, UIC, or PSD permit or for contesting a 
decision on an NPDES permit or a decision to terminate a RCRA permit. 
For the purposes of this section, a final permit decision means a final 
decision to issue, deny, modify, revoke and reissue, or terminate a 
permit.
    (b) A final permit decision (or a decision to deny a permit for the 
active life of a RCRA hazardous waste management facility or unit under 
Sec. 270.29) shall become effective 30 days after the service of notice 
of the decision unless:
    (1) A later effective date is specified in the decision; or
    (2) Review is requested under Sec. 124.19 (RCRA, UIC, and PSD 
permits) or an evidentiary hearing is requested under Sec. 124.74 (NPDES 
permit and RCRA permit terminations); or
    (3) No comments requested a change in the draft permit, in which 
case the permit shall become effective immediately upon issuance.

[48 FR 14264, Apr. 1, 1983, as amended at 54 FR 9607, Mar. 7, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 124.16  Stays of contested permit conditions.

    (a) Stays. (1) If a request for review of a RCRA or UIC permit under 
Sec. 124.19 or an NPDES permit under Sec. 124.74 or Sec. 124.114 is 
granted or if conditions of a RCRA or UIC permit are consolidated for 
reconsideration in an evidentiary hearing on an NPDES permit under 
Secs. 124.74, 124.82 or 124.114, the effect of the contested permit 
conditions shall be stayed and shall not be subject to judicial review 
pending final agency action. (No stay of a PSD permit is available under 
this section.) If the permit involves a new facility or new injection 
well, new source, new discharger or a recommencing discharger, the 
applicant shall be without a permit for the proposed new facility, 
injection well, source or discharger pending final agency action. See 
also Sec. 124.60.
    (2) Uncontested conditions which are not severable from those 
contested shall be stayed together with the contested conditions. Stayed 
provisions of permits for existing facilities, injection wells, and 
sources shall be identified by the Regional Administrator. All other 
provisions of the permit for the existing facility, injection well, or 
source shall remain fully effective and enforceable.
    (b) Stays based on cross effects. (1) A stay may be granted based on 
the grounds that an appeal to the Administrator under Sec. 124.19 of one 
permit may result in changes to another EPA-issued permit only when each 
of the permits involved has been appealed to the Administrator and he or 
she has accepted each appeal.
    (2) No stay of an EPA-issued RCRA, UIC, or NPDES permit shall be 
granted based on the staying of any State-issued permit except at the 
discretion of the Regional Administrator and only upon written request 
from the State Director.
    (c) Any facility or activity holding an existing permit must:
    (1) Comply with the conditions of that permit during any 
modification or

[[Page 504]]

revocation and reissuance proceeding under Sec. 124.5; and
    (2) To the extent conditions of any new permit are stayed under this 
section, comply with the conditions of the existing permit which 
correspond to the stayed conditions, unless compliance with the existing 
conditions would be technologically incompatible with compliance with 
other conditions of the new permit which have not been stayed.


<R05>
Sec. 124.17  Response to comments.

    (a) (Applicable to State programs, see Secs. 123.25 (NPDES), 145.11 
(UIC), 233.26 (404), and 271.14 (RCRA).) At the time that any final 
permit decision is issued under Sec. 124.15, the Director shall issue a 
response to comments. States are only required to issue a response to 
comments when a final permit is issued. This response shall:
    (1) Specify which provisions, if any, of the draft permit have been 
changed in the final permit decision, and the reasons for the change; 
and
    (2) Briefly describe and respond to all significant comments on the 
draft permit or the permit application (for section 404 permits only) 
raised during the public comment period, or during any hearing.
    (b) For EPA-issued permits, any documents cited in the response to 
comments shall be included in the administrative record for the final 
permit decision as defined in Sec. 124.18. If new points are raised or 
new material supplied during the public comment period, EPA may document 
its response to those matters by adding new materials to the 
administrative record.
    (c) (Applicable to State programs, see Secs. 123.25 (NPDES), 145.11 
(UIC), 233.26 (404), and 271.14 (RCRA).) The response to comments shall 
be available to the public.


<R05>
Sec. 124.18  Administrative record for final permit when EPA is the permitting authority.

    (a) The Regional Administrator shall base final permit decisions 
under Sec. 124.15 on the administrative record defined in this section.
    (b) The administrative record for any final permit shall consist of 
the administrative record for the draft permit and:
    (1) All comments received during the public comment period provided 
under Sec. 124.10 (including any extension or reopening under 
Sec. 124.14);
    (2) The tape or transcript of any hearing(s) held under Sec. 124.12;
    (3) Any written materials submitted at such a hearing;
    (4) The response to comments required by Sec. 124.17 and any new 
material placed in the record under that section;

section should be added to the record as soon as possible after their 
receipt or publication by the Agency. The record shall be complete on 
the date the final permit is issued.
    (d) This section applies to all final RCRA, UIC, PSD, and NPDES 
permits when the draft permit was subject to the administrative record 
requirements of Sec. 124.9 and to all NPDES permits when the draft 
permit was included in a public notice after October 12, 1979.
    (e) Material readily available at the issuing Regional Office, or 
published materials which are generally available and which are included 
in the administrative record under the standards of this section or of 
Sec. 124.17 (``Response to comments''), need not be physically included 
in the same file as the rest of the record as long as it is specifically 
referred to in the statement of basis or fact sheet or in the response 
to comments.


<R05>
Sec. 124.19  Appeal of RCRA, UIC, and PSD permits.

    (a) Within 30 days after a RCRA, UIC, or PSD final permit decision 
(or a decision under Sec. 270.29 to deny a permit for the active life of 
a RCRA hazardous waste management facility or unit) has been issued 
under Sec. 124.15, any person who filed comments on that draft permit or 
participated in the public hearing may petition the Environmental

[[Page 505]]

Appeals Board to review any condition of the permit decision. Any person 
who failed to file comments or failed to participate in the public 
hearing on the draft permit may petition for administrative review only 
to the extent of the changes from the draft to the final permit 
decision. The 30-day period within which a person may request review 
under this section begins with the service of notice of the Regional 
Administrator's action unless a later date is specified in that notice. 
The petition shall include a statement of the reasons supporting that 
review, including a demonstration that any issues being raised were 
raised during the public comment period (including any public hearing) 
to the extent required by these regulations and when appropriate, a 
showing that the condition in question is based on:
    (1) A finding of fact or conclusion of law which is clearly 
erroneous, or
    (2) An exercise of discretion or an important policy consideration 
which the Environmental Appeals Board should, in its discretion, review.
    (b) The Environmental Appeals Board may also decide on its 
initiative to review any condition of any RCRA, UIC, or PSD permit 
issued under this part. The Environmental Appeals Board must act under 
this paragraph within 30 days of the service date of notice of the 
Regional Administrator's action.
    (c) Within a reasonable time following the filing of the petition 
for review, the Environmental Appeals Board shall issue an order 
granting or denying the petition for review. To the extent review is 
denied, the conditions of the final permit decision become final agency 
action. Public notice of any grant of review by the Environmental 
Appeals Board under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be given 
as provided in Sec. 124.10. Public notice shall set forth a briefing 
schedule for the appeal and shall state that any interested person may 
file an amicus brief. Notice of denial of review shall be sent only to 
the person(s) requesting review.
    (d) The Environmental Appeals Board may defer consideration of an 
appeal of a RCRA or UIC permit under this section until the completion 
of formal proceedings under subpart E or F relating to an NPDES permit 
issued to the same facility or activity upon concluding that:
    (1) The NPDES permit is likely to raise issues relevant to a 
decision of the RCRA or UIC appeals;
    (2) The NPDES permit is likely to be appealed; and
    (3) Either: (i) The interests of both the facility or activity and 
the public are not likely to be materially adversely affected by the 
deferral; or
    (ii) Any adverse effect is outweighed by the benefits likely to 
result from a consolidated decision on appeal.
    (e) A petition to the Environmental Appeals Board under paragraph 
(a) of this section is, under 5 U.S.C. 704, a prerequisite to the 
seeking of judicial review of the final agency action.
    (f)(1) For purposes of judicial review under the appropriate Act, 
final agency action occurs when a final RCRA, UIC, or PSD permit is 
issued or denied by EPA and agency review procedures are exhausted. A 
final permit decision shall be issued by the Regional Administrator:
    (i) When the Environmental Appeals Board issues notice to the 
parties that review has been denied;
    (ii) When the Environmental Appeals Board issues a decision on the 
merits of the appeal and the decision does not include a remand of the 
proceedings; or
    (iii) Upon the completion of remand proceedings if the proceedings 
are remanded, unless the Environmental Appeals Board's remand order 
specifically provides that appeal of the remand decision will be 
required to exhaust administrative remedies.
    (2) Notice of any final agency action regarding a PSD permit shall 
promptly be published in the Federal Register.
    (g) Motions to reconsider a final order shall be filed within ten 
(10) days after service of the final order. Every such motion must set 
forth the matters claimed to have been erroneously decided and the 
nature of the alleged errors. Motions for reconsideration under this 
provision shall be directed to, and decided by, the Environmental 
Appeals Board. Motions for reconsideration directed to the 
administrator, rather than to the Environmental Appeals Board, will not 
be considered, except in cases that the Environmental

[[Page 506]]

Appeals Board has referred to the Administrator pursuant to Sec. 124.2 
and in which the Administrator has issued the final order. A motion for 
reconsideration shall not stay the effective date of the final order 
unless specifically so ordered by the Environmental Appeals Board.

<R05>
Sec. 124.20  Computation of time.

    (a) Any time period scheduled to begin on the occurrence of an act 
or event shall begin on the day after the act or event.
    (b) Any time period scheduled to begin before the occurrence of an 
act or event shall be computed so that the period ends on the day before 
the act or event.
    (c) If the final day of any time period falls on a weekend or legal 
holiday, the time period shall be extended to the next working day.
    (d) Whenever a party or interested person has the right or is 
required to act within a prescribed period after the service of notice 
or other paper upon him or her by mail, 3 days shall be added to the 
prescribed time.


<R05>
Sec. 124.21  Effective date of part 124.

    (a) Except for paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, part 124 will 
become effective July 18, 1980. Because this effective date will precede 
the processing of any RCRA or UIC permits, part 124 will apply in its 
entirety to all RCRA and UIC permits.
    (b) All provisions of part 124 pertaining to the RCRA program will 
become effective on November 19, 1980.
    (c) All provisions of part 124 pertaining to the UIC program will 
become effective July 18, 1980, but shall not be implemented until the 
effective date of 40 CFR part 146.
    (d) This part does not significantly change the way in which NPDES 
permits are processed. Since October 12, 1979, NPDES permits have been 
the subject to almost identical requirements in the revised NPDES 
regulations which were promulgated on June 7, 1979. See 44 FR 32948. To 
the extent this part changes the revised NPDES permit regulations, those 
changes will take effect as to all permit proceedings in progress on 
July 3, 1980.
    (e) This part also does not significantly change the way in which 
PSD permits are processed. For the most part, these regulations will 
also apply to PSD proceedings in progress on July 18, 1980. However, 
because it would be disruptive to require retroactively a formal 
administrative record for PSD permits issued without one, Secs. 124.9 
and 124.18 will apply to PSD permits for which draft permits were 
prepared after the effective date of these regulations.


<R04>
        Subpart B--Specific Procedures Applicable to RCRA Permits


<R05>
Sec. 124.31  Pre-application public meeting and notice.

    (a) Applicability. The requirements of this section shall apply to 
all RCRA part B applications seeking initial permits for hazardous waste 
management units over which EPA has permit issuance authority. The 
requirements of this section shall also apply to RCRA part B 
applications seeking renewal of permits for such units, where the 
renewal application is proposing a significant change in facility 
operations. For the purposes of this section, a ``significant change'' 
is any change that would qualify as a class 3 permit modification under 
40 CFR 270.42. For the purposes of this section only, ``hazardous waste 
management units over which EPA has permit issuance authority'' refers 
to hazardous waste management units for which the State where the units 
are located has not been authorized to issue RCRA permits pursuant to 40 
CFR part 271. The requirements of this section do not apply to permit 
modifications under 40 CFR 270.42 or to applications that are submitted 
for the sole purpose of conducting post-closure activities or post-
closure activities and corrective action at a facility.
    (b) Prior to the submission of a part B RCRA permit application for 
a facility, the applicant must hold at least one meeting with the public 
in order to solicit questions from the community and inform the 
community of proposed hazardous waste management activities. The 
applicant shall post a sign-in

[[Page 507]]

sheet or otherwise provide a voluntary opportunity for attendees to 
provide their names and addresses.
    (c) The applicant shall submit a summary of the meeting, along with 
the list of attendees and their addresses developed under paragraph (b) 
of this section, and copies of any written comments or materials 
submitted at the meeting, to the permitting agency as a part of the part 
B application, in accordance with 40 CFR 270.14(b).
    (d) The applicant must provide public notice of the pre-application 
meeting at least 30 days prior to the meeting. The applicant must 
maintain, and provide to the permitting agency upon request, 
documentation of the notice.
    (1) The applicant shall provide public notice in all of the 
following forms:
    (i) A newspaper advertisement. The applicant shall publish a notice, 
fulfilling the requirements in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, in a 
newspaper of general circulation in the county or equivalent 
jurisdiction that hosts the proposed location of the facility. In 
addition, the Director shall instruct the applicant to publish the 
notice in newspapers of general circulation in adjacent counties or 
equivalent jurisdictions, where the Director determines that such 
publication is necessary to inform the affected public. The notice must 
be published as a display advertisement.
    (ii) A visible and accessible sign. The applicant shall post a 
notice on a clearly marked sign at or near the facility, fulfilling the 
requirements in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If the applicant 
places the sign on the facility property, then the sign must be large 
enough to be readable from the nearest point where the public would pass 
by the site.
    (iii) A broadcast media announcement. The applicant shall broadcast 
a notice, fulfilling the requirements in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section, at least once on at least one local radio station or television 
station. The applicant may employ another medium with prior approval of 
the Director.
    (iv) A notice to the permitting agency. The applicant shall send a 
copy of the newspaper notice to the permitting agency and to the 
appropriate units of State and local government, in accordance with 
Sec. 124.10(c)(1)(x).
    (2) The notices required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section must 
include:
    (i) The date, time, and location of the meeting;
    (ii) A brief description of the purpose of the meeting;
    (iii) A brief description of the facility and proposed operations, 
including the address or a map (e.g., a sketched or copied street map) 
of the facility location;
    (iv) A statement encouraging people to contact the facility at least 
72 hours before the meeting if they need special access to participate 
in the meeting; and
    (v) The name, address, and telephone number of a contact person for 
the applicant.

<R05>
Sec. 124.32  Public notice requirements at the application stage.

    (a) Applicability. The requirements of this section shall apply to 
all RCRA part B applications seeking initial permits for hazardous waste 
management units over which EPA has permit issuance authority. The 
requirements of this section shall also apply to RCRA part B 
applications seeking renewal of permits for such units under 40 CFR 
270.51. For the purposes of this section only, ``hazardous waste 
management units over which EPA has permit issuance authority'' refers 
to hazardous waste management units for which the State where the units 
are located has not been authorized to issue RCRA permits pursuant to 40 
CFR part 271. The requirements of this section do not apply to permit 
modifications under 40 CFR 270.42 or permit applications submitted for 
the sole purpose of conducting post-closure activities or post-closure 
activities and corrective action at a facility.
    (b) Notification at application submittal.
    (1) The Director shall provide public notice as set forth in 
Sec. 124.10(c)(1)(ix), and notice to appropriate units of State and 
local government as set forth in Sec. 124.10(c)(1)(x), that a part B 
permit application has been submitted to the Agency and is available for 
review.

[[Page 508]]

    (2) The notice shall be published within a reasonable period of time 
after the application is received by the Director. The notice must 
include:
    (i) The name and telephone number of the applicant's contact person;
    (ii) The name and telephone number of the permitting agency's 
contact office, and a mailing address to which information, opinions, 
and inquiries may be directed throughout the permit review process;
    (iii) An address to which people can write in order to be put on the 
facility mailing list;
    (iv) The location where copies of the permit application and any 
supporting documents can be viewed and copied;
    (v) A brief description of the facility and proposed operations, 
including the address or a map (e.g., a sketched or copied street map) 
of the facility location on the front page of the notice; and
    (vi) The date that the application was submitted.
    (c) Concurrent with the notice required under Sec. 124.32(b) of this 
subpart, the Director must place the permit application and any 
supporting documents in a location accessible to the public in the 
vicinity of the facility or at the permitting agency's office.

[60 FR 63432, Dec. 11, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 124.33  Information repository.

    (a) Applicability. The requirements of this section apply to all 
applications seeking RCRA permits for hazardous waste management units 
over which EPA has permit issuance authority. For the purposes of this 
section only, ``hazardous waste management units over which EPA has 
permit issuance authority'' refers to hazardous waste management units 
for which the State where the units are located has not been authorized 
to issue RCRA permits pursuant to 40 CFR part 271.
    (b) The Director may assess the need, on a case-by-case basis, for 
an information repository. When assessing the need for an information 
repository, the Director shall consider a variety of factors, including: 
the level of public interest; the type of facility; the presence of an 
existing repository; and the proximity to the nearest copy of the 
administrative record. If the Director determines, at any time after 
submittal of a permit application, that there is a need for a 
repository, then the Director shall notify the facility that it must 
establish and maintain an information repository. (See 40 CFR 270.30(m) 
for similar provisions relating to the information repository during the 
life of a permit).
    (c) The information repository shall contain all documents, reports, 
data, and information deemed necessary by the Director to fulfill the 
purposes for which the repository is established. The Director shall 
have the discretion to limit the contents of the repository.
    (d) The information repository shall be located and maintained at a 
site chosen by the facility. If the Director finds the site unsuitable 
for the purposes and persons for which it was established, due to 
problems with the location, hours of availability, access, or other 
relevant considerations, then the Director shall specify a more 
appropriate site.
    (e) The Director shall specify requirements for informing the public 
about the information repository. At a minimum, the Director shall 
require the facility to provide a written notice about the information 
repository to all individuals on the facility mailing list.
    (f) The facility owner/operator shall be responsible for maintaining 
and updating the repository with appropriate information throughout a 
time period specified by the Director. The Director may close the 
repository at his or her discretion, based on the factors in paragraph 
(b) of this section.

        Subpart C--Specific Procedures Applicable to PSD Permits


<R05>
Sec. 124.41  Definitions applicable to PSD permits.

    Whenever PSD permits are processed under this part, the following 
terms shall have the following meanings:
    Administrator, EPA, and Regional Administrator shall have the 
meanings set forth in Sec. 124.2, except when EPA has delegated 
authority to administer those regulations to another agency under the 
applicable subsection of 40 CFR 52.21, the term EPA shall mean

[[Page 509]]

the delegate agency and the term Regional Administrator shall mean the 
chief administrative officer of the delegate agency.
    Application means an application for a PSD permit.
    Appropriate Act and Regulations means the Clean Air Act and 
applicable regulations promulgated under it.
    Approved program means a State implementation plan providing for 
issuance of PSD permits which has been approved by EPA under the Clean 
Air Act and 40 CFR part 51. An approved State is one administering an 
approved program. State Director as used in Sec. 124.4 means the 
person(s) responsible for issuing PSD permits under an approved program, 
or that person's delegated representative.
    Construction has the meaning given in 40 CFR 52.21.
    Director means the Regional Administrator.
    Draft permit shall have the meaning set forth in Sec. 124.2.
    Facility or activity means a major PSD stationary source or major 
PSD modification.
    Federal Land Manager has the meaning given in 40 CFR 52.21.
    Indian Governing Body has the meaning given in 40 CFR 52.21.
    Major PSD modification means a major modification as defined in 40 
CFR 52.21.
    Major PSD stationary source means a major stationary source as 
defined in 40 CFR 52.21(b)(1).

PSD stationary source or major PSD modification.
    Site means the land or water area upon which a major PSD stationary 
source or major PSD modification is physically located or conducted, 
including but not limited to adjacent land used for utility systems; as 
repair, storage, shipping or processing areas; or otherwise in 
connection with the major PSD stationary source or major PSD 
modification.
    State means a State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa and includes 
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.


<R05>
Sec. 124.42  Additional procedures for PSD permits affecting Class I areas.

    (a) The Regional Administrator shall provide notice of any permit 
application for a proposed major PSD stationary source or major PSD 
modification the emissions from which would affect a Class I area to the 
Federal Land Manager, and the Federal official charged with direct 
responsibility for management of any lands within such area. The 
Regional Administrator shall provide such notice promptly after 
receiving the application.
    (b) Any demonstration which the Federal Land Manager wishes to 
present under 40 CFR 52.21(q)(3), and any variances sought by an owner 
or operator under Sec. 52.21(q)(4) shall be submitted in writing, 
together with any necessary supporting analysis, by the end of the 
public comment period under Sec. 124.10 or Sec. 124.118. (40 CFR 
52.21(q)(3) provides for denial of a PSD permit to a facility or 
activity when the Federal Land Manager demonstrates that its emissions 
would adversely affect a Class I area even though the applicable 
increments would not be exceeded. 40 CFR 52.21(q)(4) conversely 
authorizes EPA, with the concurrence of the Federal Land Manager and 
State responsible, to grant certain variances from the otherwise 
applicable emission limitations to a facility or activity whose 
emissions would affect a Class I area.)
    (c) Variances authorized by 40 CFR 52.21 (q)(5) through (q)(7) shall 
be handled as specified in those paragraphs and shall not be subject to 
this part. Upon receiving appropriate documentation of a variance 
properly granted under any of these provisions, the Regional 
Administrator shall enter the variance in the administrative record.

[[Page 510]]

Any decisions later made in proceedings under this part concerning that 
permit shall be consistent with the conditions of that variance.

Sec. 124.51  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart sets forth additional requirements and procedures 
for decisionmaking for the NPDES program.
    (b) Decisions on NPDES variance requests ordinarily will be made 
during the permit issuance process. Variances and other changes in 
permit conditions ordinarily will be decided through the same notice-
and-comment and hearing procedures as the basic permit.
    (c) As stated in 40 CFR 131.4, an Indian Tribe that meets the 
statutory criteria which authorize EPA to treat the Tribe in a manner 
similar to that in which it treats a State for purposes of the Water 
Quality Standards program is likewise qualified for such treatment for 
purposes of State certification of water quality standards pursuant to 
section 401(a)(1) of the Act and subpart D of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 124.52  Permits required on a case-by-case basis.

    (a) Various sections of part 122, subpart B allow the Director to 
determine, on a case-by-case basis, that certain concentrated animal 
feeding operations (Sec. 122.23), concentrated aquatic animal production 
facilities (Sec. l22.24), storm water discharges (Sec. 122.26), and 
certain other facilities covered by general permits (Sec. 122.28) that 
do not generally require an individual permit may be required to obtain 
an individual permit because of their contributions to water pollution.
    (b) Whenever the Regional Administrator decides that an individual 
permit is required under this section, except as provided in paragraph 
(c) of this section, the Regional Administrator shall notify the 
discharger in writing of that decision and the reasons for it, and shall 
send an application form with the notice. The discharger must apply for 
a permit under Sec. 122.21 within 60 days of notice, unless permission 
for a later date is granted by the Regional Administrator. The question 
whether the designation was proper will remain open for consideration 
during the public comment period under Sec. 124.11 or Sec. 124.118 and 
in any subsequent hearing.
    (c) Prior to a case-by-case determination that an individual permit 
is required for a storm water discharge under this section (see 40 CFR 
122.26 (a)(1)(v), (c)(1)(v), and (g)(1)(i)), the Regional Administrator 
may require the discharger to submit a permit application or other 
information regarding the discharge under section 308 of the CWA. In 
requiring such information, the Regional Administrator shall notify the 
discharger in writing and shall send an application form with the 
notice. The discharger must apply for a permit under 40 CFR 122.26 
(a)(1)(v) and (c)(1)(v) within 60 days of notice or under 40 CFR 
122.26(g)(1)(i) within 180 days of notice, unless permission for a later 
date is granted by the Regional Administrator. The question whether the 
initial designation was proper will remain open for consideration during 
the public comment period under Sec. 124.11 or Sec. 124.118 and in any 
subsequent hearing.

<R05>
Sec. 124.53  State certification.

    (a) Under CWA section 401(a)(1), EPA may not issue a permit until a 
certification is granted or waived in accordance with that section by 
the State in which the discharge originates or will originate.
    (b) Applications received without a State certification shall be 
forwarded by the Regional Administrator to the certifying State agency 
with a request that certification be granted or denied.
    (c) If State certification has not been received by the time the 
draft permit is prepared, the Regional Administrator shall send the 
certifying State agency:
    (1) A copy of a draft permit;
    (2) A statement that EPA cannot issue or deny the permit until the 
certifying State agency has granted or denied certification under 
Sec. 124.55, or waived its right to certify; and

[[Page 511]]

    (3) A statement that the State will be deemed to have waived its 
right to certify unless that right is exercised within a specified 
reasonable time not to exceed 60 days from the date the draft permit is 
mailed to the certifying State agency unless the Regional Administrator 
finds that unusual circumstances require a longer time.
    (d) State certification shall be granted or denied within the 
reasonable time specified under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The 
State shall send a notice of its action, including a copy of any 
certification, to the applicant and the Regional Administrator.
    (e) State certification shall be in writing and shall include:
    (1) Conditions which are necessary to assure compliance with the 
applicable provisions of CWA sections 208(e), 301, 302, 303, 306, and 
307 and with appropriate requirements of State law;
    (2) When the State certifies a draft permit instead of a permit 
application, any conditions more stringent than those in the draft 
permit which the State finds necessary to meet the requirements listed 
in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. For each more stringent condition, 
the certifying State agency shall cite the CWA or State law references 
upon which that condition is based. Failure to provide such a citation 
waives the right to certify with respect to that condition; and
    (3) A statement of the extent to which each condition of the draft 
permit can be made less stringent without violating the requirements of 
State law, including water quality standards. Failure to provide this 
statement for any condition waives the right to certify or object to any 
less stringent condition which may be established during the EPA permit 
issuance process.


<R05>
Sec. 124.54  Special provisions for State certification and concurrence on applications for section 301(h) variances.

    (a) When an application for a permit incorporating a variance 
request under CWA section 301(h) is submitted to a State, the 
appropriate State official shall either:
    (1) Deny the request for the CWA section 301(h) variance (and so 
notify the applicant and EPA) and, if the State is an approved NPDES 
State and the permit is due for reissuance, process the permit 
application under normal procedures; or
    (2) Forward a certification meeting the requirements of Sec. 124.53 
to the Regional Administrator.
    (b) When EPA issues a tentative decision on the request for a 
variance under CWA section 301(h), and no certification has been 
received under paragraph (a) of this section, the Regional Administrator 
shall forward the tentative decision to the State in accordance with 
Sec. 124.53(b) specifying a reasonable time for State certification and 
concurrence. If the State fails to deny or grant certification and 
concurrence under paragraph (a) of this section within such reasonable 
time, certification shall be waived and the State shall be deemed to 
have concurred in the issuance of a CWA section 301(h) variance.
    (c) Any certification provided by a State under paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section shall constitute the State's concurrence (as required by 
section 301(h)) in the issuance of the permit incorporating a section 
301(h) variance subject to any conditions specified therein by the 
State. CWA section 301(h) certification and concurrence under this 
section will not be forwarded to the State by EPA for recertification 
after the permit issuance process; States must specify any conditions 
required by State law, including water quality standards, in the initial 
certification.

Sec. 124.55  Effect of State certification.

    (a) When certification is required under CWA section 401(a)(1) no 
final permit shall be issued:
    (1) If certification is denied, or
    (2) Unless the final permit incorporates the requirements specified 
in the certification under Sec. 124.53(d)(1) and (2).
    (b) If there is a change in the State law or regulation upon which a 
certification is based, or if a court of competent jurisdiction or 
appropriate State board or agency stays, vacates, or remands a 
certification, a State which has issued a certification under 
Sec. 124.53 may issue a modified certification or notice of waiver and 
forward

[[Page 512]]

it to EPA. If the modified certification is received before final agency 
action on the permit, the permit shall be consistent with the more 
stringent conditions which are based upon State law identified in such 
certification. If the certification or notice of waiver is received 
after final agency action on the permit, the Regional Administrator may 
modify the permit on request of the permittee only to the extent 
necessary to delete any conditions based on a condition in a 
certification invalidated by a court of competent jurisdiction or by an 
appropriate State board or agency.
    (c) A State may not condition or deny a certification on the grounds 
that State law allows a less stringent permit condition. The Regional 
Administrator shall disregard any such certification conditions, and 
shall consider those conditions or denials as waivers of certification.
    (d) A condition in a draft permit may be changed during agency 
review in any manner consistent with a certification meeting the 
requirements of Sec. 124.53(d). No such changes shall require EPA to 
submit the permit to the State for recertification.
    (e) Review and appeals of limitations and conditions attributable to 
State certification shall be made through the applicable procedures of 
the State and may not be made through the procedures in this part.
    (f) Nothing in this section shall affect EPA's obligation to comply 
with Sec. 122.47. See CWA section 301(b)(1)(C).


<R05>
Sec. 124.56  Fact sheets.

    (Applicable to State programs, see Sec. 123.25 (NPDES).) In addition 
to meeting the requirements of Sec. 124.8, NPDES fact sheets shall 
contain the following:
    (a) Any calculations or other necessary explanation of the 
derivation of specific effluent limitations and conditions or standards 
for sewage sludge use or disposal, including a citation to the 
applicable effluent limitation guideline, performance standard, or 
standard for sewage sludge use or disposal as required by Sec. 122.44 
and reasons why they are applicable or an explanation of how the 
alternate effluent limitations were developed.
    (b)(1) When the draft permit contains any of the following 
conditions, an explanation of the reasons why such conditions are 
applicable:
    (i) Limitations to control toxic pollutants under Sec. 122.44(e);
    (ii) Limitations on internal waste streams under Sec. 122.45(i); or
    (iii) Limitations on indicator pollutants under Sec. 125.3(g).
    (iv) Limitations set on a case-by-case basis under Sec. 125.3 (c)(2) 
or (c)(3), or pursuant to Section 405(d)(4) of the CWA.
    (2) For every permit to be issued to a treatment works owned by a 
person other than a State or municipality, an explanation of the 
Director's decision on regulation of users under Sec. 122.44(m).
    (c) When appropriate, a sketch or detailed description of the 
location of the discharge or regulated activity described in the 
application; and
    (d) For EPA-issued NPDES permits, the requirements of any State 
certification under Sec. 124.53.
    (e) For permits that include a sewage sludge land application plan 
under 40 CFR 501.15(a)(2)(ix), a brief description of how each of the 
required elements of the land application plan are addressed in the 
permit.

<R05>
Sec. 124.59  Conditions requested by the Corps of Engineers and other government agencies.

    (Applicable to State programs, see Sec. 123.25 (NPDES).) (a) If 
during the comment period for an NPDES draft permit, the District 
Engineer advises the Director in writing that anchorage and navigation 
of any of the waters of the United States would be substantially 
impaired by the granting of a permit, the permit shall be denied and the 
applicant so notified. If the District Engineer advised the Director 
that imposing specified conditions upon the permit is necessary to avoid 
any substantial impairment of anchorage or navigation, then the Director 
shall include the specified conditions in the permit. Review or appeal 
of denial of a permit or of conditions specified by the District 
Engineer shall be made through the applicable procedures of the Corps of 
Engineers, and may not be made through the procedures provided in this 
part. If the conditions are stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction 
or by applicable procedures of the Corps of Engineers, those conditions 
shall be considered stayed in the NPDES permit for the duration of that 
stay.
    (b) If during the comment period the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
the National Marine Fisheries Service, or any other State or Federal 
agency with jurisdiction over fish, wildlife, or public health advises 
the Director in writing that the imposition of specified conditions upon 
the permit is necessary to avoid substantial impairment of fish, 
shellfish, or wildlife resources, the Director may include the specified 
conditions in the permit to the extent they are determined necessary to 
carry out the provisions of Sec. 122.49 and of the CWA.
    (c) In appropriate cases the Director may consult with one or more 
of the agencies referred to in this section before issuing a draft 
permit and may reflect their views in the statement of basis, the fact 
sheet, or the draft permit.

<R05>
Sec. 124.60  Issuance and effective date and stays of NPDES permits.

    In addition to the requirements of Sec. 124.15, the following 
provisions apply to NPDES permits and to RCRA or UIC permits to the 
extent those permits may have been consolidated with an NPDES permit in 
a formal hearing:
    (a)(1) If a request for a formal hearing is granted under 
Sec. 124.75 or Sec. 124.114 regarding the initial permit issued for a 
new source, a new discharger, or a recommencing discharger, or if a 
petition for review of the denial of a request for a formal hearing with 
respect to such a permit is timely filed with the Administrator under 
Sec. 124.91, the applicant shall be without a permit pending final 
Agency action under Sec. 124.91.
    (2) Whenever a source or facility subject to this paragraph or to 
paragraph (c)(7) of this section has received a final permit under 
Sec. 124.15 which is the subject of a hearing request under Sec. 124.74 
or a formal hearing under Sec. 124.75, the Presiding Officer, on motion 
by the source or facility, may issue an order authorizing it to begin 
discharges (or in the case of RCRA permits, construction or operations) 
if it complies with all uncontested conditions of the final permit and 
all other appropriate conditions imposed by the Presiding Officer during 
the period until final agency action. The motion shall be granted if no 
party opposes it, or if the source or facility demonstrates that:
    (i) It is likely to receive a permit to discharge (or in the case of 
RCRA permits, to operate or construct) at that site;
    (ii) The environment will not be irreparably harmed if the source or 
facility is allowed to begin discharging (or in the case of RCRA, to 
begin operating or construction) in compliance with the conditions of 
the Presiding Officer's order pending final agency action; and
    (iii) Its discharge (or in the case of RCRA, its operation or 
construction) pending final agency action is in the public interest.
    (3) For RCRA only, no order under paragraph (a)(2) may authorize a 
facility to commence construction if any party has challenged a 
construction-related permit term or condition.
    (b) The Regional Administrator, at any time prior to the rendering 
of an initial decision in a formal hearing on a permit, may withdraw the 
permit and prepare a new draft permit under Sec. 124.6 addressing the 
portions so withdrawn. The new draft permit shall proceed through the 
same process of public comment and opportunity for a public hearing as 
would apply to any other draft permit subject to this part. Any portions 
of the permit which are not withdrawn and which are not stayed under 
this section shall remain in effect.
    (c)(1) If a request for a formal hearing is granted in whole or in 
part under Sec. 124.75 regarding a permit for an existing source, or if 
a petition for review of the denial of a request for a formal hearing 
with respect to that permit is timely filed with the Administrator under 
Sec. 124.91, the force and effect of the contested conditions of the 
final permit shall be stayed. The Regional Administrator shall notify, 
in accordance with Sec. 124.75, the discharger and all parties of the 
uncontested conditions of the final permit that are enforceable 
obligations of the discharger.
    (2) When effluent limitations are contested, but the underlying 
control technology is not, the notice shall identify the installation of 
the technology in accordance with the permit compliance schedules (if 
uncontested) as an uncontested, enforceable obligation of the permit.
    (3) When a combination of technologies is contested, but a portion 
of the combination is not contested, that portion shall be identified as 
uncontested if compatible with the combination of technologies proposed 
by the requester.
    (4) Uncontested conditions, if inseverable from a contested 
condition, shall be considered contested.
    (5) Uncontested conditions shall become enforceable 30 days after 
the date of notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section granting the 
request. If, however, a request for a formal hearing on a condition was 
denied and the denial is appealed under Sec. 124.91, then that condition 
shall become enforceable upon the date of the notice of the 
Administrator's decision on the appeal if the denial is affirmed, or 
shall be

[[Page 515]]

stayed, in accordance with this section, if the Administrator reverses 
the denial and grants the evidentiary hearing.
    (6) Uncontested conditions shall include:
    (i) Preliminary design and engineering studies or other requirements 
necessary to achieve the final permit conditions which do not entail 
substantial expenditures;
    (ii) Permit conditions which will have to be met regardless of which 
party prevails at the evidentiary hearing;
    (iii) When the discharger proposed a less stringent level of 
treatment than that contained in the final permit, any permit conditions 
appropriate to meet the levels proposed by the discharger, if the 
measures required to attain that less stringent level of treatment are 
consistent with the measures required to attain the limits proposed by 
any other party; and
    (iv) Construction activities, such as segregation of waste streams 
or installation of equipment, which would partially meet the final 
permit conditions and could also be used to achieve the discharger's 
proposed alternative conditions.
    (7) If for any offshore or coastal mobile exploratory drilling rig 
or coastal mobile developmental drilling rig which has never received a 
finally effective permit to discharge at a ``site,'' but which is not a 
``new discharger'' or a ``new source,'' the Regional Administrator finds 
that compliance with certain permit conditions may be necessary to avoid 
irreparable environmental harm during the administrative review, he may 
specify in the statement of basis or fact sheet that those conditions, 
even if contested, shall remain enforceable obligations of the 
discharger during administrative review unless otherwise modified by the 
Presiding Officer under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (d) If at any time after a hearing is granted and after the Regional 
Administrator's notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section it becomes 
clear that a permit requirement is no longer contested, any party may 
request the Presiding Officer to issue an order identifying the 
requirements as uncontested. The requirement identified in such order 
shall become enforceable 30 days after the issuance of the order.
    (e) When a formal hearing is granted under Sec. 124.75 on an 
application for a renewal of an existing permit, all provisions of the 
existing permit as well as uncontested provisions of the new permit, 
shall continue fully enforceable and effective until final agency action 
under Sec. 124.91. (See Sec. 122.6) Upon written request from the 
applicant, the Regional Administrator may delete requirements from the 
existing permit which unnecessarily duplicate uncontested provisions of 
the new permit.
    (f) When issuing a finally effective NPDES permit the conditions of 
which were the subject of a formal hearing under subpart E or F, the 
Regional Administrator shall extend the permit compliance schedule to 
the extent required by a stay under this section provided that no such 
extension shall be granted which would:
    (1) Result in the violation of an applicable statutory deadline; or
    (2) Cause the permit to expire more than 5 years after issuance 
under Sec. 124.15(a).

    Note: Extensions of compliance schedules under Sec. 124.60(f)(2) 
will not automatically be granted for a period equal to the period the 
stay is in effect for an effluent limitation. For example, if both the 
Agency and the discharger agree that a certain treatment technology is 
required by the CWA where guidelines do not apply, but a hearing is 
granted to consider the effluent limitations which the technology will 
achieve, requirements regarding installation of the underlying 
technology will not be stayed during the hearing. Thus, unless the 
hearing extends beyond the final compliance date in the permit, it will 
not ordinarily be necessary to extend the compliance schedule. However, 
when application of an underlying technology is challenged, the stay for 
installation requirements relating to that technology would extend for 
the duration of the hearing.

    (g) For purposes of judicial review under CWA section 509(b), final 
agency action on a permit does not occur unless and until a party has 
exhausted its administrative remedies under subparts E and F and 
Sec. 124.91. Any party which neglects or fails to seek review

[[Page 516]]

under Sec. 124.91 thereby waives its opportunity to exhaust available 
agency remedies.

Sec. 124.62  Decision on variances.

    (Applicable to State programs, see Sec. 123.25 (NPDES).)
    (a) The Director may grant or deny requests for the following 
variances (subject to EPA objection under Sec. 123.44 for State 
permits):
    (1) Extensions under CWA section 301(i) based on delay in completion 
of a publicly owned treatment works;
    (2) After consultation with the Regional Administrator, extensions 
under CWA section 301(k) based on the use of innovative technology; or
    (3) Variances under CWA section 316(a) for thermal pollution.
    (b) The State Director may deny, or forward to the Regional 
Administrator with a written concurrence, or submit to EPA without 
recommendation a completed request for:
    (1) A variance based on the economic capability of the applicant 
under CWA section 301(c); or
    (2) A variance based on water quality related effluent limitations 
under CWA section 302(b)(2).
    (c) The Regional Administrator may deny, forward, or submit to the 
EPA Office Director for Water Enforcement and Permits with a 
recommendation for approval, a request for a variance listed in 
paragraph (b) of this section that is forwarded by the State Director, 
or that is submitted to the Regional Administrator by the requester 
where EPA is the permitting authority.
    (d) The EPA Office Director for Water Enforcement and Permits may 
approve or deny any variance request submitted under paragraph (c) of 
this section. If the Office Director approves the variance, the Director 
may prepare a draft permit incorporating the variance. Any public notice 
of a draft permit for which a variance or modification has been approved 
or denied shall identify the applicable procedures for appealing that 
decision under Sec. 124.64.
    (e) The State Director may deny or forward to the Administrator (or 
his delegate) with a written concurrence a completed request for:
    (1) A variance based on the presence of ``fundamentally different 
factors'' from those on which an effluent limitations guideline was 
based;
    (2) A variance based upon certain water quality factors under CWA 
section 301(g).
    (f) The Administrator (or his delegate) may grant or deny a request 
for a variance listed in paragraph (e) of this section that is forwarded 
by the State Director, or that is submitted to EPA by the requester 
where EPA is the permitting authority. If the Administrator (or his 
delegate) approves the variance, the State Director or Regional 
Administrator may prepare a draft permit incorporating the variance. Any 
public notice of a draft permit for which a variance or modification has 
been approved or denied shall identify the applicable procedures for 
appealing that decision under Sec. 124.64.

Sec. 124.63  Procedures for variances when EPA is the permitting authority.

    (a) In States where EPA is the permit issuing authority and a 
request for a variance is filed as required by Sec. 122.21, the request 
shall be processed as follows:
    (1)(i) If, at the time, that a request for a variance based on the 
presence of fundamentally different factors or on section 301(g) of the 
CWA is submitted, the Regional Administrator has received an application 
under Sec. 124.3 for issuance or renewal of that permit, but has not yet 
prepared a draft permit under Sec. 124.6 covering the discharge in

[[Page 517]]

question, the Administrator (or his delegate) shall give notice of a 
tentative decision on the request at the time the notice of the draft 
permit is prepared as specified in Sec. 124.10, unless this would 
significantly delay the processing of the permit. In that case the 
processing of the variance request may be separated from the permit in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and the processing of 
the permit shall proceed without delay.
    (ii) If, at the time, that a request for a variance under sections 
301(c) or 302(b)(2) of the CWA is submitted, the Regional Administrator 
has received an application under Sec. 124.3 for issuance or renewal of 
that permit, but has not yet prepared a draft permit under Sec. 124.6 
covering the discharge in question, the Regional Administrator, after 
obtaining any necessary concurrence of the EPA Deputy Assistant 
Administrator for Water Enforcement under Sec. 124.62, shall give notice 
of a tentative decision on the request at the time the notice of the 
draft permit is prepared as specified in Sec. 124.10, unless this would 
significantly delay the processing of the permit. In that case the 
processing of the variance request may be separated from the permit in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and the processing of 
the permit shall proceed without delay.
    (2) If, at the time that a request for a variance is filed the 
Regional Administrator has given notice under Sec. 124.10 of a draft 
permit covering the discharge in question, but that permit has not yet 
become final, administrative proceedings concerning that permit may be 
stayed and the Regional Administrator shall prepare a new draft permit 
including a tentative decision on the request, and the fact sheet 
required by Sec. 124.8. However, if this will significantly delay the 
processing of the existing draft permit or the Regional Administrator, 
for other reasons, considers combining the variance request and the 
existing draft permit inadvisable, the request may be separated from the 
permit in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and the 
administrative dispositon of the existing draft permit shall proceed 
without delay.
    (3) If the permit has become final and no application under 
Sec. 124.3 concerning it is pending or if the variance request has been 
separated from a draft permit as described in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) 
of this section, the Regional Administrator may prepare a new draft 
permit and give notice of it under Sec. 124.10. This draft permit shall 
be accompanied by the fact sheet required by Sec. 124.8 except that the 
only matters considered shall relate to the requested variance.

Sec. 124.64  Appeals of variances.

    (a) When a State issues a permit on which EPA has made a variance 
decision, separate appeals of the State permit and of the EPA variance 
decision are possible. If the owner or operator is challenging the same 
issues in both proceedings, the Regional Administrator will decide, in 
consultation with State officials, which case will be heard first.
    (b) Variance decisions made by EPA may be appealed under either 
subpart E or F, provided the requirements of the applicable subpart are 
met. However, whenever the basic permit decision is eligible only for an 
evidentiary hearing under subpart E while the variance decision is 
eligible only for a panel hearing under subpart F, the issues relating 
to both the basic permit decision and the variance decision shall be 
considered in the subpart E proceeding. No subpart F hearing may be held 
if a subpart E hearing would be held in addition. See Sec. 124.111(b).
    (c) Stays for section 301(g) variances. If a request for an 
evidentiary hearing is granted on a variance requested under CWA section 
301(g), or if a petition for review of the denial of a request for the 
hearing is filed under Sec. 124.91, any otherwise applicable standards 
and limitations under CWA section 301 shall not be stayed unless:
    (1) In the judgment of the Regional Administrator, the stay or the 
variance sought will not result in the discharge of pollutants in 
quantities which may reasonably be anticipated to pose an unacceptable 
risk to human health or the environment because of bioaccumulation, 
persistency in the

[[Page 518]]

environment, acute toxicity, chronic toxicity, or synergistic 
propensities; and
    (2) In the judgment of the Regional Administrator, there is a 
substantial likelihood that the discharger will succeed on the merits of 
its appeal; and
    (3) The discharger files a bond or other appropriate security which 
is required by the Regional Administrator to assure timely compliance 
with the requirements from which a variance is sought in the event that 
the appeal is unsuccessful.
    (d) Stays for variances other than section 301(g) are governed by 
Sec. 124.60.

<R05>
Sec. 124.66  Special procedures for decisions on thermal variances under section 316(a).

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 124.65, the only issues connected 
with issuance of a particular permit on which EPA will make a final 
Agency decision before the final permit is issued under Secs. 124.15 and 
124.60 are whether alternative effluent limitations would be justified 
under CWA section 316(a) and whether cooling water intake structures 
will use the best available technology under section 316(b). Permit 
applicants who wish an early decision on these issues should request it 
and furnish supporting reasons at the time their permit applications are 
filed under Sec. 122.21. The Regional Administrator will then decide 
whether or not to make an early decision. If it is granted, both the 
early decision on CWA section 316 (a) or (b) issues and the grant of the 
balance of the permit shall be considered permit issuance under these 
regulations, and shall be subject to the same requirements of public 
notice and comment and the same opportunity for an evidentiary or panel 
hearing under subpart E or F.
    (b) If the Regional Administrator, on review of the administrative 
record, determines that the information necessary to decide whether or 
not the CWA section 316(a) issue is not likely to be available in time 
for a decision on permit issuance, the Regional Administrator may issue 
a permit under Sec. 124.15 for a term up to 5 years. This permit shall 
require achievement of the effluent limitations initially proposed for 
the thermal component of the discharge no later than the date otherwise 
required by law. However, the permit shall also afford the permittee an 
opportunity to file a demonstration under CWA section 316(a) after 
conducting such studies as are required under 40 CFR part 125, subpart 
H. A new discharger may not exceed the thermal effluent limitation which 
is initially proposed unless and until its CWA section 316(a) variance 
request is finally approved.
    (c) Any proceeding held under paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
publicly noticed as required by Sec. 124.10 and shall be conducted at a 
time allowing the permittee to take necessary measures to meet the final 
compliance date in the event its request for modification of thermal 
limits is denied.
    (d) Whenever the Regional Administrator defers the decision under 
CWA section 316(a), any decision under section 316(b) may be deferred.

  Subpart E--Evidentiary Hearings for EPA-Issued NPDES Permits and EPA-
                         Terminated RCRA Permits


<R05>
Sec. 124.71  Applicability.

    (a) The regulations in this subpart govern all formal hearings 
conducted by EPA under CWA sections 402 and 405(f), except those 
conducted under subpart F. They also govern all evidentiary hearings 
conducted under RCRA section 3008 in connection with the termination of 
a RCRA permit. This includes termination of interim status for failure 
to furnish information needed to make a final decision. A formal hearing 
is available to challenge any NPDES permit issued under Sec. 124.15 
except for a general permit. Persons affected by a general permit may 
not challenge the conditions of a general permit as of right in further 
agency proceedings. They may instead either challenge the general permit 
in court, or apply for an individual NPDES permit under Sec. 122.21 as 
authorized in Sec. 122.28 and then request a formal hearing on the 
issuance or denial of an individual permit. (The Regional Administrator 
also has the discretion to use the procedures of subpart F for general 
permits. See Sec. 124.111).

[[Page 519]]

    (b) In certain cases, evidentiary hearings under this subpart may 
also be held on the conditions of UIC permits, or of RCRA permits which 
are being issued, modified, or revoked and reissued, rather than 
terminated or suspended. This will occur when the conditions of the UIC 
or RCRA permit in question are closely linked with the conditions of an 
NPDES permit as to which an evidentiary hearing has been granted. See 
Sec. 124.74(b)(2). Any interested person may challenge the Regional 
Administrator's initial new source determination by requesting an 
evidentiary hearing under this part. See Sec. 122.29.
    (c) PSD permits may never be subject to an evidentiary hearing under 
this subpart. Section 124.74(b)(2)(iv) provides only for consolidation 
of PSD permits with other permits subject to a panel hearing under 
subpart F.

<R05>
Sec. 124.72  Definitions.

    For the purpose of this subpart, the following definitions are 
applicable:
    Environmental Appeals Board shall mean the Board within the Agency 
described in Sec. 1.25 of this title. The Administrator delegates 
authority to the Environmental Appeals Board to issue final decisions in 
NPDES appeals filed under this subpart. An appeal directed to the 
Administrator, rather than to the Environmental Appeals Board, will not 
be considered. This delegation does not preclude the Environmental 
Appeals Board from referring an appeal or a motion to the Administrator 
when the Environmental Appeals Board, in its discretion, deems it 
appropriate to do so. When an appeal or motion is referred to the 
Administrator by the Environmental Appeals Board, all parties shall be 
so notified and the rules in this subpart referring to the Environmental 
Appeals Board shall be interpreted as referring to the Administrator.
    Hearing Clerk means The Hearing Clerk, U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460.
    Party means the EPA trial staff under Sec. 124.78 and any person 
whose request for a hearing under Sec. 124.74 or whose request to be 
admitted as a party or to intervene under Sec. 124.79 or Sec. 124.117 
has been granted.
    Presiding Officer for the purposes of this subpart means an 
Administrative Law Judge appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3105 and designated to 
preside at the hearing. Under subpart F other persons may also serve as 
hearing officers. See Sec. 124.119.
    Regional Hearing Clerk means an employee of the Agency designated by 
a Regional Administrator to establish a repository for all books, 
records, documents, and other materials relating to hearings under this 
subpart.

[48 FR 14264, Apr. 1, 1983, as amended at 57 FR 5335, Feb. 13, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 124.73  Filing and submission of documents.

    (a) All submissions authorized or required to be filed with the 
Agency under this subpart shall be filed with the Regional Hearing 
Clerk, unless otherwise provided by regulation. Submissions shall be 
considered filed on the date on which they are mailed or delivered in 
person to the Regional Hearing Clerk.
    (b) All submissions shall be signed by the person making the 
submission, or by an attorney or other authorized agent or 
representative.
    (c)(1) All data and information referred to or in any way relied 
upon in any submission shall be included in full and may not be 
incorporated by reference, unless previously submitted as part of the 
administrative record in the same proceeding. This requirement does not 
apply to State or Federal statutes and regulations, judicial decisions 
published in a national reporter system, officially issued EPA documents 
of general applicability, and any other generally available reference 
material which may be incorporated by reference. Any party incorporating 
materials by reference shall provide copies upon request by the Regional 
Administrator or the Presiding Officer.
    (2) If any part of the material submitted is in a foreign language, 
it shall be accompanied by an English translation verified under oath to 
be complete and accurate, together with the name, address, and a brief 
statement of

[[Page 520]]

the qualifications of the person making the translation. Translations of 
literature or other material in a foreign language shall be accompanied 
by copies of the original publication.
    (3) Where relevant data or information is contained in a document 
also containing irrelevant matter, either the irrelevant matter shall be 
deleted or the relevant portions shall be indicated.
    (4) Failure to comply with the requirements of this section or any 
other requirement in this subpart may result in the noncomplying 
portions of the submission being excluded from consideration. If the 
Regional Administrator or the Presiding Officer, on motion by any party 
or sua sponte, determines that a submission fails to meet any 
requirement of this subpart, the Regional Administrator or Presiding 
Officer shall direct the Regional Hearing Clerk to return the 
submission, together with a reference to the applicable regulations. A 
party whose materials have been rejected has 14 days to correct the 
errors and resubmit, unless the Regional Administrator or the Presiding 
Officer finds good cause to allow a longer time.
    (d) The filing of a submission shall not mean or imply that it in 
fact meets all applicable requirements or that it contains reasonable 
grounds for the action requested or that the action requested is in 
accordance with law.
    (e) The original of all statements and documents containing factual 
material, data, or other information shall be signed in ink and shall 
state the name, address, and the representative capacity of the person 
making the submission.


<R05>
Sec. 124.74  Requests for evidentiary hearing.

    (a) Within 30 days following the service of notice of the Regional 
Administrator's final permit decision under Sec. 124.15, any interested 
person may submit a request to the Regional Administrator under 
paragraph (b) of this section for an evidentiary hearing to reconsider 
or contest that decision. If such a request is submitted by a person 
other than the permittee, the person shall simultaneously serve a copy 
of the request on the permittee.
    (b)(1) In accordance with Sec. 124.76, such requests shall state 
each legal or factual question alleged to be at issue, and their 
relevance to the permit decision, together with a designation of the 
specific factual areas to be adjudicated and the hearing time estimated 
to be necessary for adjudication. Information supporting the request or 
other written documents relied upon to support the request shall be 
submitted as required by Sec. 124.73 unless they are already part of the 
administrative record required by Sec. 124.18.

    Note: This paragraph allows the submission of requests for 
evidentiary hearings even though both legal and factual issues may be 
raised, or only legal issues may be raised. In the latter case, because 
no factual issues were raised, the Regional Administrator would be 
required to deny the request. However, on review of the denial the 
Environmental Appeals Board is authorized by Sec. 124.91(a)(1) to review 
policy or legal conclusions of the Regional Administrator. EPA is 
requiring an appeal to the Environmental Appeals Board even of purely 
legal issues involved in a permit decision to ensure that the 
Environmental Appeals Board will have an opportunity to review any 
permit before it will be final and subject to judicial review.

    (2) Persons requesting an evidentiary hearing on an NPDES permit 
under this section may also request an evidentiary hearing on a RCRA or 
UIC permit, PSD permits may never be made part of an evidentiary hearing 
under subpart E. This request is subject to all the requirements of 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section and in addition will be granted only 
if:
    (i) Processing of the RCRA or UIC permit at issue was consolidated 
with the processing of the NPDES permit as provided in Sec. 124.4;
    (ii) The standards for granting a hearing on the NPDES permit are 
met;
    (iii) The resolution of the NPDES permit issues is likely to make 
necessary or appropriate modification of the RCRA or UIC permit; and
    (iv) If a PSD permit is involved, a permittee who is eligible for an 
evidentiary hearing under subpart E on his or her NPDES permit requests 
that the formal hearing be conducted under

[[Page 521]]

the procedures of subpart F and the Regional Administrator finds that 
consolidation is unlikly to delay final permit issuance beyond the PSD 
one-year statutory deadline.
    (c) These requests shall also contain:
    (1) The name, mailing address, and telephone number of the person 
making such request;
    (2) A clear and concise factual statement of the nature and scope of 
the interest of the requester;
    (3) The names and addresses of all persons whom the requester 
represents; and
    (4) A statement by the requester that, upon motion of any party 
granted by the Presiding Officer, or upon order of the Presiding Officer 
sua sponte without cost or expense to any other party, the requester 
shall make available to appear and testify, the following:
    (i) The requester;
    (ii) All persons represented by the requester; and
    (iii) All officers, directors, employees, consultants, and agents of 
the requester and the persons represented by the requester.
    (5) Specific references to the contested permit conditions, as well 
as suggested revised or alternative permit conditions (including permit 
denials) which, in the judgment of the requester, would be required to 
implement the purposes and policies of the CWA.
    (6) In the case of challenges to the application of control or 
treatment technologies identified in the statement of basis or fact 
sheet, identification of the basis for the objection, and the 
alternative technologies or combination of technologies which the 
requester believes are necessary to meet the requirements of the CWA.
    (7) Identification of the permit obligations that are contested or 
are inseverable from contested conditions and should be stayed if the 
request is granted by reference to the particular contested conditions 
warranting the stay.
    (8) Hearing requests also may ask that a formal hearing be held 
under the procedures set forth in subpart F. An applicant may make such 
a request even if the proceeding does not constitute ``initial 
licensing'' as defined in Sec. 124.111.
    (d) If the Regional Administrator grants an evidentiary hearing 
request, in whole or in part, the Regional Administrator shall identify 
the permit conditions which have been contested by the requester and for 
which the evidentiary hearing has been granted. Permit conditions which 
are not contested or for which the Regional Administrator has denied the 
hearing request shall not be affected by, or considered at, the 
evidentiary hearing. The Regional Administrator shall specify these 
conditions in writing in accordance with Sec. 124.60(c).
    (e) The Regional Administrator must grant or deny all requests for 
an evidentiary hearing on a particular permit. All requests that are 
granted for a particular permit shall be combined in a single 
evidentiary hearing.
    (f) The Regional Administrator (upon notice to all persons who have 
already submitted hearing requests) may extend the time allowed for 
submitting hearing requests under this section for good cause.

<R05>
Sec. 124.75  Decision on request for a hearing.

    (a)(1) Within 30 days following the expiration of the time allowed 
by Sec. 124.74 for submitting an evidentiary hearing request, the 
Regional Administrator shall decide the extent to which, if at all, the 
request shall be granted, provided that the request conforms to the 
requirements of Sec. 124.74, and sets forth material issues of fact 
relevant to the issuance of the permit.
    (2) When an NPDES permit for which a hearing request has been 
granted constitutes ``initial licensing'' under Sec. 124.111, the 
Regional Administrator may elect to hold a formal hearing under the 
procedures of subpart F rather than under the procedures of this subpart 
even if no person has requested that subpart F be applied. If the 
Regional Administrator makes such a decision, he or she shall issue a 
notice of hearing under Sec. 124.116. All subsequent proceedings shall 
then be governed by Secs. 124.117 through 124.121, except that

[[Page 522]]

any reference to a draft permit shall mean the final permit.
    (3) Whenever the Regional Administrator grants a request made under 
Sec. 124.74(c)(8) for a formal hearing under subpart F on an NPDES 
permit that does not constitute an initial license under Sec. 124.111, 
the Regional Administrator shall issue a notice of hearing under 
Sec. 124.116 including a statement that the permit will be processed 
under the procedures of subpart F unless a written objection is received 
within 30 days. If no valid objection is received, the application shall 
be processed in accordance with Secs. 124.117 through 124.121, except 
that any reference to a draft permit shall mean the final permit. If a 
valid objection is received, this subpart shall be applied instead.
    (b) If a request for a hearing is denied in whole or in part, the 
Regional Administrator shall briefly state the reasons. That denial is 
subject to review by the Environmental Appeals Board under Sec. 124.91.

[48 FR 14264, Apr. 1, 1983, as amended at 57 FR 5336, Feb. 13, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 124.76  Obligation to submit evidence and raise issues before a final permit is issued.

    In any case where the Regional Administrator elected to apply the 
requirements of Sec. 124.14(a), no evidence shall be submitted by any 
party to a hearing under this Subpart that was not submitted to the 
administrative record required by Sec. 124.18 as part of the preparation 
of and comment on a draft permit, unless good cause is shown for the 
failure to submit it. No issues shall be raised by any party that were 
not submitted to the administrative record required by Sec. 124.18 as 
part of the preparation of and comment on a draft permit unless good 
cause is shown for the failure to submit them. Good cause includes the 
case where the party seeking to raise the new issues or introduce new 
information shows that it could not reasonably have ascertained the 
issues or made the information available within the time required by 
Sec. 124.15; or that it could not have reasonably anticipated the 
relevance or materiality of the information sought to be introduced. 
Good cause exists for the introduction of data available on operation 
authorized under Sec. 124.60(a)(2).

[49 FR 38051, Sept. 26, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 124.77  Notice of hearing.

    Public notice of the grant of an evidentiary hearing regarding a 
permit shall be given as provided in Sec. 124.57(b) and by mailing a 
copy to all persons who commented on the draft permit, testified at the 
public hearing, or submitted a request for a hearing. Before the 
issuance of the notice, the Regional Administrator shall designate the

trial staff;
    (2) Decisional body means any Agency employee who is or may 
reasonably be expected to be involved in the decisional process of the 
proceeding including the Administrator, the members of the Environmental 
Appeals Board, the Presiding Officer, the Regional Administrator (if he 
or she does not designate himself or herself as a member of the Agency 
trial staff), and any of their staff participating in the decisional 
process. In the case of a nonadversary panel hearing, the decisional 
body shall also include the panel members, whether or not permanently 
employed by the Agency;
    (3) Ex parte communication means any communication, written or oral, 
relating to the merits of the proceeding between the decisional body and 
an interested person outside the Agency or the

[[Page 523]]

include:
    (i) Communications between Agency employees other than between the 
Agency trial staff and the members of the decisional body;
    (ii) Discussions between the decisional body and either:
    (A) Interested persons outside the Agency, or
    (B) The Agency trial staff, if all parties have received prior 
written notice of the proposed communications and have been given the 
opportunity to be present and participate therein.
    (4) Interested person outside the Agency includes the permit 
applicant, any person who filed written comments in the proceeding, any 
person who requested the hearing, any person who requested to 
participate or intervene in the hearing, any participant in the hearing 
and any other interested person not employed by the Agency at the time 
of the communications, and any attorney of record for those persons.
    (b)(1) No interested person outside the Agency or member of the 
Agency trial staff shall make or knowingly cause to be made to any 
members of the decisional body, an ex parte communication on the merits 
of the proceedings.
    (2) No member of the decisional body shall make or knowingly cause 
to be made to any interested person outside the Agency or member of the 
Agency trial staff, an ex parte communication on the merits of the

knowingly causes to be made a communication prohibited by this 
subsection shall file with the Regional Hearing Clerk all written 
communications or memoranda stating the substance of all oral 
communications together with all written responses and memoranda stating 
the substance of all oral responses.
    (c) Whenever any member of the decisionmaking body receives an ex 
parte communication knowingly made or knowingly caused to be made by a 
party or representative of a party in violation of this section, the 
person presiding at the stage of the hearing then in progress may, to 
the extent consistent with justice and the policy of the CWA, require 
the party to show cause why its claim or interest in the proceedings 
should not be dismissed, denied, disregarded, or otherwise adversely 
affected on account of such violation.
    (d) The prohibitions of this section begin to apply upon issuance of 
the notice of the grant of a hearing under Sec. 124.77 or Sec. 124.116. 
This prohibition terminates at the date of final agency action.

<R05>
Sec. 124.79  Additional parties and issues.

    (a) Any person may submit a request to be admitted as a party within 
15 days after the date of mailing, publication, or posting of notice of 
the grant of an evidentiary hearing, whichever occurs last. The 
Presiding Officer shall grant requests that meet the requirements of 
Secs. 124.74 and 124.76.
    (b) After the expiration of the time prescribed in paragraph (a) of 
this section any person may file a motion for leave to intervene as a 
party. This motion must meet the requirements of Secs. 124.74 and 124.76 
and set forth the grounds for the proposed intervention. No factual or 
legal issues, besides those raised by timely hearing requests, may be 
proposed except for good cause. A motion for leave to intervene must 
also contain a verified statement showing good cause for the failure to 
file a timely request to be admitted as a party. The Presiding Officer 
shall grant the motion only upon an express finding on the record that:
    (1) Extraordinary circumstances justify granting the motion;
    (2) The intervener has consented to be bound by:
    (i) Prior written agreements and stipulations by and between the 
existing parties; and
    (ii) All orders previously entered in the proceedings; and

<R05>
Sec. 124.81  Assignment of Administrative Law Judge.

    No later than the date of mailing, publication, or posting of the

Regional Administrator shall refer the proceeding to the Chief 
Administrative Law Judge who shall assign an Administrative Law Judge to 
serve as Presiding Officer for the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 124.82  Consolidation and severance.

    (a) The Administrator, Regional Administrator, or Presiding Officer 
has the discretion to consolidate, in whole or in part, two or more 
proceedings to be held under this subpart, whenever it appears that a 
joint hearing on any or all of the matters in issue would expedite or 
simplify consideration of the issues and that no party would be 
prejudiced thereby. Consolidation shall not affect the right of any 
party to raise issues that might have been raised had there been no 
consolidation.
    (b) If the Presiding Officer determines consolidation is not 
conducive to an expeditious, full, and fair hearing, any party or issues 
may be severed and heard in a separate proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 124.83  Prehearing conferences.

    (a) The Presiding Officer, sua sponte, or at the request of any 
party, may direct the parties or their attorneys or duly authorized 
representatives to appear at a specified time and place for one or more 
conferences before or during a hearing, or to submit written proposals 
or correspond for the purpose of considering any of the matters set 
forth in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) The Presiding Officer shall allow a reasonable period before the 
hearing begins for the orderly completion of all prehearing procedures 
and for the submission and disposition of all prehearing motions. Where 
the circumstances warrant, the Presiding Officer may call a prehearing 
conference to inquire into the use of available procedures contemplated 
by the parties and the time required for their completion, to establish 
a schedule for their completion, and to set a tentative date for 
beginning the hearing.
    (c) In conferences held, or in suggestions submitted, under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the following matter may be considered:
    (1) Simplification, clarification, amplification, or limitation of 
the issues.
    (2) Admission of facts and of the genuineness of documents, and 
stipulations of facts.
    (3) Objections to the introduction into evidence at the hearing of 
any written testimony, documents, papers, exhibits, or other submissions 
proposed by a party, except that the administrative record required by 
Sec. 124.19 shall be received in evidence subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 124.85(d)(2). At any time before the end of the hearing any party 
may make, and the Presiding Officer shall consider and rule upon, 
motions to strike testimony or other evidence other than the 
administrative record on the grounds of relevance, competency, or 
materiality.
    (4) Matters subject to official notice may be taken.
    (5) Scheduling as many of the following as are deemed necessary and 
proper by the Presiding Officer:
    (i) Submission of narrative statements of position on each factual 
issue in controversy;

[[Page 525]]

    (ii) Submission of written testimony and documentary evidence (e.g., 
affidavits, data, studies, reports, and any other type of written 
material) in support of those statements; or
    (iii) Requests by any party for the production of additional 
documentation, data, or other information relevant and material to the 
facts in issue.
    (6) Grouping participants with substantially similar interests to 
eliminate redundant evidence, motions, and objections.
    (7) Such other matters that may expedite the hearing or aid in the 
disposition of the matter.
    (d) At a prehearing conference or at some other reasonable time set 
by the Presiding Officer, each party shall make available to all other 
parties the names of the expert and other witnesses it expects to call. 
At its discretion or at the request of the Presiding Officer, a party 
may include a brief narrative summary of any witness's anticipated 
testimony. Copies of any written testimony, documents, papers, exhibits, 
or materials which a party expects to introduce into evidence, and the 
administrative record required by Sec. 124.18 shall be marked for 
identification as ordered by the Presiding Officer. Witnesses, proposed 
written testimony, and other evidence may be added or amended upon order 
of the Presiding Officer for good cause shown. Agency employees and 
consultants shall be made available as witnesses by the Agency to the 
same extent that production of such witnesses is required of other 
parties under Sec. 124.74(c)(4). (See also Sec. 124.85(b)(16).)
    (e) The Presiding Officer shall prepare a written prehearing order 
reciting the actions taken at each prehearing conference and setting 
forth the schedule for the hearing, unless a transcript has been taken 
and accurately reflects these matters. The order shall include a written 
statement of the areas of factual agreement and disagreement and of the 
methods and procedures to be used in developing the evidence and the 
respective duties of the parties in connection therewith. This order 
shall control the subsequent course of the hearing unless modified by 
the Presiding Officer for good cause shown.


<R05>
Sec. 124.84  Summary determination.

    (a) Any party to an evidentiary hearing may move with or without 
supporting affidavits and briefs for a summary determination in its 
favor upon any of the issues being adjudicated on the basis that there 
is no genuine issue of material fact for determination. This motion 
shall be filed at least 45 days before the date set for the hearing, 
except that upon good cause shown the motion may be filed at any time 
before the close of the hearing.
    (b) Any other party may, within 30 days after service of the motion, 
file and serve a response to it or a countermotion for summary 
determination. When a motion for summary determination is made and 
supported, a party opposing the motion may not rest upon mere 
allegations or denials but must show, by affidavit or by other materials 
subject to consideration by the Presiding Officer, that there is a 
genuine issue of material fact for determination at the hearing.
    (c) Affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth 
facts that would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively 
that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.
    (d) The Presiding Officer may set the matter for oral argument and 
call for the submission of proposed findings, conclusions, briefs, or 
memoranda of law. The Presiding Officer shall rule on the motion not 
more than 30 days after the date responses to the motion are filed under 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) If all factual issues are decided by summary determination, no 
hearing will be held and the Presiding Officer shall prepare an initial 
decision under Sec. 124.89. If summary determination is denied or if 
partial summary determination is granted, the Presiding Officer shall 
issue a memorandum opinion and order, interlocutory in character, and 
the hearing will proceed on the remaining issues. Appeals from 
interlocutory rulings are governed by Sec. 124.90.
    (f) Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing a 
motion for

[[Page 526]]

summary determination that he or she cannot for reasons stated present, 
by affidavit or otherwise, facts essential to justify his or her 
opposition, the Presiding Officer may deny the motion or order a 
continuance to allow additional affidavits or other information to be 
obtained or may make such other order as is just and proper.


<R05>
Sec. 124.85  Hearing procedure.

    (a)(1) The permit applicant always bears the burden of persuading 
the Agency that a permit authorizing pollutants to be discharged should 
be issued and not denied. This burden does not shift.

    Note: In many cases the documents contained in the administrative 
record, in particular the fact sheet or statement of basis and the 
response to comments, should adequately discharge this burden.

    (2) The Agency has the burden of going forward to present an 
affirmative case in support of any challenged condition of a final 
permit.
    (3) Any hearing participant who, by raising material issues of fact, 
contends:
    (i) That particular conditions or requirements in the permit are 
improper or invalid, and who desires either:
    (A) The inclusion of new or different conditions or requirements; or
    (B) The deletion of those conditions or requirements; or
    (ii) That the denial or issuance of a permit is otherwise improper 
or invalid, shall have the burden of going forward to present an 
affirmative case at the conclusion of the Agency case on the challenged 
requirement.
    (b) The Presiding Officer shall conduct a fair and impartial 
hearing, take action to avoid unnecessary delay in the disposition of 
the proceedings, and maintain order. For these purposes, the Presiding 
Officer may:
    (1) Arrange and issue notice of the date, time, and place of 
hearings and conferences;
    (2) Establish the methods and procedures to be used in the 
development of the evidence;
    (3) Prepare, after considering the views of the participants, 
written statements of areas of factual disagreement among the 
participants;
    (4) Hold conferences to settle, simplify, determine, or strike any 
of the issues in a hearing, or to consider other matters that may 
facilitate the expeditious disposition of the hearing;
    (5) Administer oaths and affirmations;
    (6) Regulate the course of the hearing and govern the conduct of 
participants;
    (7) Examine witnesses;
    (8) Identify and refer issues for interlocutory decision under 
Sec. 124.90;
    (9) Rule on, admit, exclude, or limit evidence;
    (10) Establish the time for filing motions, testimony, and other 
written evidence, briefs, findings, and other submissions;
    (11) Rule on motions and other procedural matters pending before 
him, including but not limited to motions for summary determination in 
accordance with Sec. 124.84;
    (12) Order that the hearing be conducted in stages whenever the 
number of parties is large or the issues are numerous and complex;
    (13) Take any action not inconsistent with the provisions of this 
subpart for the maintenance of order at the hearing and for the 
expeditious, fair, and impartial conduct of the proceeding;
    (14) Provide for the testimony of opposing witnesses to be heard 
simultaneously or for such witnesses to meet outside the hearing to 
resolve or isolate issues or conflicts;
    (15) Order that trade secrets be treated as confidential business 
information in accordance with Secs. 122.7 (NPDES) and 270.12 (RCRA) and 
40 CFR part 2; and
    (16) Allow such cross-examination as may be required for a full and 
true disclosure of the facts. No cross-examination shall be allowed on 
questions of policy except to the extent required to disclose the 
factual basis for permit requirements, or on questions of law, or 
regarding matters (such as the validity of effluent limitations 
guidelines) that are not subject to challenge in an evidentiary hearing. 
No Agency witnesses shall be required to testify or be made available 
for cross-examination on such matters. In deciding whether or not to 
allow cross-examination, the Presiding Officer shall consider the 
likelihood of clarifying or resolving a

[[Page 527]]

disputed issue of material fact compared to other available methods. The 
party seeking cross-examination has the burden of demonstrating that 
this standard has been met.
    (c) All direct and rebuttal evidence at an evidentiary hearing shall 
be submitted in written form, unless, upon motion and good cause shown, 
the Presiding Officer determines that oral presentation of the evidence 
on any particular fact will materially assist in the efficient 
identification and clarification of the issues. Written testimony shall 
be prepared in narrative form.
    (d)(1) The Presiding Officer shall admit all relevant, competent, 
and material evidence, except evidence that is unduly repetitious. 
Evidence may be received at any hearing even though inadmissible under 
the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings. The weight to 
be given evidence shall be determined by its reliability and probative 
value.
    (2) The administrative record required by Sec. 124.18 shall be 
admitted and received in evidence. Upon motion by any party the 
Presiding Officer may direct that a witness be provided to sponsor a 
portion or portions of the administrative record. The Presiding Officer, 
upon finding that the standards in Sec. 124.85(b)(3) have been met, 
shall direct the appropriate party to produce the witness for cross-
examination. If a sponsoring witness cannot be provided, the Presiding 
Officer may reduce the weight accorded the appropriate portion of the 
record.

    Note: Receiving the administrative record into evidence 
automatically serves several purposes: (1) It documents the prior course 
of the proceedings; (2) it provides a record of the views of affected 
persons for consideration by the agency decisionmaker; and (3) it 
provides factual material for use by the decisionmaker.

    (3) Whenever any evidence or testimony is excluded by the Presiding 
Officer as inadmissible, all such evidence or testimony existing in 
written form shall remain a part of the record as an offer of proof. The 
party seeking the admission of oral testimony may make an offer of 
proof, by means of a brief statement on the record describing the 
testimony excluded.
    (4) When two or more parties have substantially similar interests 
and positions, the Presiding Officer may limit the number of attorneys 
or other party representatives who will be permitted to cross-examine 
and to make and argue motions and objections on behalf of those parties. 
Attorneys may, however, engage in cross-examination relevant to matters 
not adequately covered by previous cross-examination.
    (5) Rulings of the Presiding Officer on the admissibility of 
evidence or testimony, the propriety of cross-examination, and other 
procedural matters shall appear in the record and shall control further 
proceedings, unless reversed as a result of an interlocutory appeal 
taken under Sec. 124.90.
    (6) All objections shall be made promptly or be deemed waived. 
Parties shall be presumed to have taken exception to an adverse ruling. 
No objection shall be deemed waived by further participation in the 
hearing.
    (e) Admission of evidence on environmental impacts. If a hearing is 
granted under this subpart for a new source subject to NEPA, the 
Presiding Officer may admit evidence relevant to any environmental 
impacts of the permitted facility if the evidence would be relevant to 
the Agency's obligation under Sec. 122.29(c)(3). If the source holds a 
final EPA-issued RCRA, PSD, or UIC permit, or an ocean dumping permit 
under the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA), no 
such evidence shall be admitted nor shall cross-examination be allowed 
relating to:
    (1) Effects on air quality, (2) effects attributable to underground 
injection or hazardous waste management practices, or (3) effects of 
ocean dumping subject to the MPRSA, which were considered or could have 
been considered in the PSD, RCRA, UIC, or MPRSA permit issuance 
proceedings. However, the presiding officer may admit without cross-
examination or any supporting witness relevant portions of the record of 
PSD, RCRA, UIC, or MPRSA permit issuance proceedings.

<R05>
Sec. 124.86  Motions.

    (a) Any party may file a motion (including a motion to dismiss a 
particular claim on a contested issue) with the Presiding Officer on any 
matter relating to the proceeding. All motions shall be in writing and 
served as provided in Sec. 124.80 except those made on the record during 
an oral hearing before the Presiding Officer.
    (b) Within 10 days after service of any written motion, any part to 
the proceeding may file a response to the motion. The time for response 
may be shortened to 3 days or extended for an additional 10 days by the 
Presiding Officer for good cause shown.
    (c) Notwithstanding Sec. 122.4, any party may file with the 
Presiding Officer a motion seeking to apply to the permit any regulatory 
or statutory provision issued or made available after the issuance of 
the permit under Sec. 124.15. The Presiding Officer shall grant any 
motion to apply a new statutory provision unless he or she finds it 
contrary to legislative intent. The Presiding Officer may grant a motion 
to apply a new regulatory requirement when appropriate to carry out the 
purpose of CWA, and when no party would be unduly prejudiced thereby.


<R05>
Sec. 124.87  Record of hearings.

    (a) All orders issued by the Presiding Officer, transcripts of oral 
hearings or arguments, written statements of position, written direct 
and rebuttal testimony, and any other data, studies, reports, 
documentation, information and other written material of any kind 
submitted in the proceeding shall be a part of the hearing record and 
shall be available to the public except as provided in Secs. 122.7 
(NPDES) and 270.12 (RCRA), in the Office of the Regional Hearing Clerk, 
as soon as it is received in that office.
    (b) Evidentiary hearings shall be either stenographically reported 
verbatim or tape recorded, and thereupon transcribed. After the hearing, 
the reporter shall certify and file with the Regional Hearing Clerk:
    (1) The original of the transcript, and
    (2) The exhibits received or offered into evidence at the hearing.
    (c) The Regional Hearing Clerk shall promptly notify each of the 
parties of the filing of the certified transcript of proceedings. Any 
party who desires a copy of the transcript of the hearing may obtain a 
copy of the hearing transcript from the Regional Hearing Clerk upon 
payment of costs.
    (d) The Presiding Officer shall allow witnesses, parties, and their 
counsel an opportunity to submit such written proposed corrections of 
the transcript of any oral testimony taken at the hearing, pointing out 
errors that may have been made in transcribing the testimony, as are 
required to make the transcript conform to the testimony. Except in 
unusual cases, no more than 30 days shall be allowed for submitting such 
corrections from the day a complete transcript of the hearing becomes 
available.


<R05>
Sec. 124.88  Proposed findings of fact and conclusions; brief.

    Within 45 days after the certified transcript is filed, any party 
may file with the Regional Hearing Clerk proposed findings of fact and 
conclusions of law and a brief in support thereof. Briefs shall contain 
appropriate references to the record. A copy of these findings, 
conclusions, and brief shall be served upon all the other parties and 
the Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer, for good cause shown, may 
extend the time for filing the proposed findings and conclusions and/or 
the brief. The Presiding Officer may allow reply briefs.


<R05>
Sec. 124.89  Decisions.

    (a) The Presiding Officer shall review and evaluate the record, 
including the proposed findings and conclusions, any briefs filed by the 
parties, and any interlocutory decisions under Sec. 124.90 and shall 
issue and file his initial decision with the Regional Hearing Clerk. The 
Regional Hearing Clerk shall immediately serve copies of the initial 
decision upon all parties (or their counsel of record) and the 
Administrator.
    (b) The initial decision of the Presiding Officer shall 
automatically become the final decision 30 days after its service unless 
within that time:
    (1) A party files a petition for review by the Environmental Appeals 
Board pursuant to Sec. 124.91; or

[[Page 529]]

    (2) The Environmental Appeals Board sua sponte files a notice that 
it will review the decision pursuant to Sec. 124.91.

[48 FR 14264, Apr. 1, 1983, as amended at 57 FR 5336, Feb. 13, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 124.90  Interlocutory appeal.

    (a) Except as provided in this section, appeals to the Environmental 
Appeals Board may be taken only under Sec. 124.91. Appeals from orders 
or rulings may be taken under this section only if the Presiding 
Officer, upon motion of a party, certifies those orders or rulings to 
the Environmental Appeals Board for appeal on the record. Requests to 
the Presiding Officer for certification must be filed in writing within 
10 days of service of notice of the order, ruling, or decision and shall 
state briefly the grounds relied on.
    (b) The Presiding Officer may certify an order or ruling for appeal 
to the Environmental Appeals Board if:
    (1) The order or ruling involves an important question on which 
there is substantial ground for difference of opinion, and
    (2) Either: (i) An immediate appeal of the order or ruling will 
materially advance the ultimate completion of the proceeding; or
    (ii) A review after the final order is issued will be inadequate or 
ineffective.
    (c) If the Environmental Appeals Board decides that certification 
was improperly granted, it shall decline to hear the appeal. The 
Environmental Appeals Board shall accept or decline all interlocutory 
appeals within 30 days of their submission; if the Environmental Appeals 
Board takes no action within that time, the appeal shall be 
automatically dismissed. When the Presiding Officer declines to certify 
an order or ruling to the Environmental Appeals Board for an 
interlocutory appeal, it may be reviewed by the Environmental Appeals 
Board only upon appeal from the initial decision of the Presiding 
Officer, except when the Environmental Appeals Board determines, upon 
motion of a party and in exceptional circumstances, that to delay review 
would not be in the public interest. Such motion shall be made within 5 
days after receipt of notification that the Presiding Officer has 
refused to certify an order or ruling for interlocutory appeal to the 
Environmental Appeals Board. Ordinarily, the interlocutory appeal will 
be decided on the basis of the submissions made to the Presiding 
Officer. The Environmental Appeals Board may, however, allow briefs and 
oral argument.
    (d) In exceptional circumstances, the Presiding Officer may stay the 
proceeding pending a decision by the Environmental Appeals Board upon an 
order or ruling certified by the Presiding Officer for an interlocutory 
appeal, or upon the denial of such certification by the Presiding 
Officer.
    (e) The failure to request an interlocutory appeal shall not prevent 
taking exception to an order or ruling in an appeal under Sec. 124.91.

[48 FR 14264, Apr. 1, 1983, as amended at 57 FR 5336, Feb. 13, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 124.91  Appeal to the Administrator.

    (a)(1) Within 30 days after service of an initial decision, or a 
denial in whole or in part of a request for an evidentiary hearing, any 
party or requester, as the case may be, may appeal any matter set forth 
in the initial decision or denial, or any adverse order or ruling to 
which the party objected during the hearing, by filing with the 
Environmental Appeals Board notice of appeal and petition for review. 
The petition shall include a statement of the supporting reasons and, 
when appropriate, a showing that the initial decision contains:
    (i) A finding of fact or conclusion of law which is clearly 
erroneous, or
    (ii) An exercise of discretion or policy which is important and 
which the Environmental Appeals Board should review.
    (2) Within 15 days after service of a petition for review under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, any other party to the proceeding may 
file a responsive petition.
    (3) Policy decisions made or legal conclusions drawn in the course 
of denying a request for an evidentiary hearing may be reviewed and 
changed by the Environmental Appeals Board in an appeal under this 
section.
    (b) Within 30 days of an initial decision or denial of a request for 
an evidentiary hearing, the Environmental Appeals Board may, sua sponte, 
review

[[Page 530]]

such decision. Within 7 days after the Environmental Appeals Board has 
decided under this section to review an initial decision or the denial 
of a request for an evidentiary hearing, notice of that decision shall 
be served by mail upon all affected parties and the Regional 
Administrator.
    (c)(1) Within a reasonable time following the filing of the petition 
for review, the Environmental Appeals Board shall issue an order either 
granting or denying the petition for review. When the Environmental 
Appeals Board grants a petition for review or determines under paragraph 
(b) of this section to review a decision, the Environmental Appeals 
Board may notify the parties that only certain issues shall be briefed.
    (2) Upon granting a petition for review, the Regional Hearing Clerk 
shall promptly forward a copy of the record to the Environmental Appeals 
Board and shall retain a complete duplicate copy of the record in the 
Regional Office.
    (d) Notwithstanding the grant of a petition for review or a 
determination under paragraph (b) of this section to review a decision, 
the Environmental Appeals Board may summarily affirm without opinion an 
initial decision or the denial of a request for an evidentiary hearing.
    (e) A petition to the Environmental Appeals Board under paragraph 
(a) of this section for review of any initial decision or the denial of 
an evidentiary hearing is, under 5 U.S.C. 704, a prerequisite to the 
seeking of judicial review of the final decision of the Agency.
    (f) If a party timely files a petition for review or if the 
Environmental Appeals Board sua sponte orders review, then, for purposes 
of judicial review, final Agency action on an issue occurs as follows:
    (1) If the Environmental Appeals Board denies review or summarily 
affirms without opinion as provided in Sec. 124.91(d), then the initial 
decision or denial becomes the final Agency action and occurs upon the 
service of notice of the Environmental Appeals Board's action.
    (2) If the Environmental Appeals Board issues a decision without 
remanding the proceeding then the final permit, redrafted as required by 
the Environmental Appeals Board's original decision, shall be reissued 
and served upon all parties to the appeal.
    (3) If the Environmental Appeals Board issues a decision remanding 
the proceeding, then final Agency action occurs upon completion of the 
remanded proceeding, inlcuding any appeals to the Environmental Appeals 
Board from the results of the remanded proceeding.
    (g) The petitioner may file a brief in support of the petition 
within 21 days after the Environmental Appeals Board has granted a 
petition for review. Any other party may file a responsive brief within 
21 days of service of the petitioner's brief. The petitioner then may 
file a reply brief within 14 days of service of the responsive brief. 
Any person may file an amicus brief for the consideration of the 
Environmental Appeals Board within the same time periods that govern 
reply briefs. If the Environmental Appeals Board determines, sua sponte, 
to review an initial Regional Administrator's decision or the denial of 
a request for an evidentiary hearing, the Environmental Appeals Board 
shall notify the parties of the schedule for filing briefs.
    (h) Review by the Environmental Appeals Board of an initial decision 
or the denial of an evidentiary hearing shall be limited to the issues 
specified under paragraph (a) of this section, except that after notice 
to all the parties, the Environmental Appeals Board may raise and decide 
other matters which it considers material on the basis of the record.
    (i) Motions to reconsider a final order shall be filed within ten 
(10) days after service of the final order. Every such motion must set 
forth the matters claimed to have been erroneously decided and the 
nature of the alleged errors. Motions for reconsideration under this 
provision shall be directed to, and decided by, the Environmental 
Appeals Board. Motions for reconsideration directed to the 
Administrator, rather than to the Environmental Appeals Board, will not 
be considered, except in cases that the Environmental Appeals Board has 
referred to the Administrator pursuant to Sec. 124.72 and

[[Page 531]]

in which the Administrator has issued the final order. A motion for 
reconsideration shall not stay the effective date of the final order 
unless specifically so ordered by the Environmental Appeals Board.

<R05>
Sec. 124.111  Applicability.

    (a) Except as set forth in this subpart, this subpart applies in 
lieu of, and to complete exclusion of, subparts A through E in the 
following cases:
    (1)(i) In any proceedings for the issuance of any NPDES permit under 
CWA sections 402 and 405(f) which constitute ``initial licensing'' under 
the Administrative Procedure Act, when the Regional Administrator elects 
to apply this subpart and explicitly so states in the public notice of 
the draft permit under Sec. 124.10 or in a supplemental notice under 
Sec. 124.14. If an NPDES draft permit is processed under this subpart, 
any other draft permits which have been consolidated with the NPDES 
draft permit under Sec. 124.4 shall likewise be processed under this 
subpart, except for PSD permits when the Regional Administrator makes a 
finding under Sec. 124.4(e) that consolidation would be likely to result 
in missing the one year statutory deadline for issuing a final PSD 
permit under the CAA.
    (ii) ``Initial licensing'' includes both the first decision on an 
NPDES permit applied for by a discharger that has not previously held 
one and the first decision on any variance requested by a discharger.
    (iii) To the extent this subpart is used to process a request for a 
variance under CWA section 301(h), the term ``Administrator or a person 
designated by the Administrator'' shall be substituted for the term 
``Regional Administrator''.
    (2) In any proceeding for which a hearing under this subpart was 
granted under Sec. 124.75 following a request for a formal hearing under 
Sec. 124.74. See Secs. 124.74(c)(8) and 124.75(a)(2).
    (3) Whenever the Regional Administrator determines as a matter of 
discretion that the more formalized mechanisms of this subpart should be 
used to process draft NPDES general permits (for which evidentiary 
hearings are unavailable under Sec. 124.71), or draft RCRA or draft UIC 
permits.
    (b) EPA shall not apply these procedures to a decision on a variance 
where subpart E proceedings are simultaneously pending on the other 
conditions of the permit. See Sec. 124.64(b).

after a final permit has been issued under Sec. 124.15, either by the 
grant under Sec. 124.75 of a hearing request under Sec. 124.74, or by 
notice of supplemental proceedings under Sec. 124.14, Secs. 124.13 and 
124.76 shall also apply.

<R05>
Sec. 124.113  Public notice of draft permits and public comment period.

    Public notice of a draft permit under this subpart shall be given as 
provided in Secs. 124.10 and 124.57. At the discretion of the Regional 
Administrator, the public comment period specified in this notice may 
include an opportunity for a public hearing under Sec. 124.12.


<R05>
Sec. 124.114  Request for hearing.

    (a) By the close of the comment period under Sec. 124.113, any 
person may request the Regional Administrator to hold a panel hearing on 
the draft permit by submitting a written request containing the 
following:
    (1) A brief statement of the interest of the person requesting the 
hearing;
    (2) A statement of any objections to the draft permit;
    (3) A statement of the issues which such person proposes to raise 
for consideration at the hearing; and
    (4) Statements meeting the requirements of Sec. 124.74(c)(1)-(5).
    (b) Whenever (1) a written request satisfying the requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section has been received and presents genuine 
issues of material fact, or (2) the Regional Administrator determines 
sua sponte that a hearing under this subpart is necessary or 
appropriate, the Regional Administrator shall notify each person 
requesting the hearing and the applicant, and shall provide public 
notice under Sec. 124.57(c). If the Regional Administrator determines 
that a request does not meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section or does not present genuine issues of fact, the Regional 
Administrator may deny the request for the hearing and shall serve 
written notice of that determination on all persons requesting the 
hearing.
    (c) The Regional Administrator may also decide before a draft permit 
is prepared under Sec. 124.6 that a hearing should be held under this 
section. In such cases, the public notice of the draft permit shall 
explicitly so state and shall contain the information required by 
Sec. 124.57(c). This notice may also provide for a hearing under 
Sec. 124.12 before a hearing is conducted under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 124.115  Effect of denial of or absence of request for hearing.

    If no request for a hearing is made under Sec. 124.114, or if all 
such requests are denied under that section, the Regional Administrator 
shall then prepare a recommended decision under Sec. 124.124. Any person 
whose hearing request has been denied may then appeal that recommended 
decision to the Environmental Appeals Board as provided in Sec. 124.91.

[48 FR 14264, Apr. 1, 1983, as amended at 57 FR 5337, Feb. 13, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 124.116  Notice of hearing.

    (a) Upon granting a request for a hearing under Sec. 124.114 the 
Regional Administrator shall promptly publish a notice of the hearing as 
required under Sec. 124.57(c). The mailed notice shall include a 
statement which indicates whether the Presiding Officer or the Regional 
Administrator will issue the Recommended decision. The mailed notice 
shall also allow the participants at least 30 days to submit written 
comments as provided under Sec. 124.118.
    (b) The Regional Administrator may also give notice of a hearing 
under this section at the same time as notice of a draft permit under 
Sec. 124.113. In that case the comment periods under Secs. 124.113 and 
124.118 shall be merged and held as a single public comment period.
    (c) The Regional Administrator may also give notice of hearing under 
this section in response to a hearing request under Sec. 124.74 as 
provided in Sec. 124.75.


<R05>
Sec. 124.117  Request to participate in hearing.

    (a) Persons desiring to participate in any hearing noticed under 
this section, shall file a request to participate with the Regional 
Hearing Clerk before the deadline set forth in the notice of the grant 
of the hearing. Any person filing such a request becomes a party to the 
proceedings within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act. The 
request shall include:
    (1) A brief statement of the interest of the person in the 
proceeding;
    (2) A brief outline of the points to be addressed;

[[Page 533]]

    (3) An estimate of the time required; and
    (4) The requirements of Sec. 124.74(c)(1)-(5).
    (5) If the request is submitted by an organization, a nonbinding 
list of the persons to take part in the presentation.
    (b) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than 2 weeks 
before the scheduled date of the hearing, the Presiding Officer shall 
make a hearing schedule available to the public and shall mail it to 
each person who requested to participate in the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 124.118  Submission of written comments on draft permit.

    (a) No later than 30 days before the scheduled start of the hearing 
(or such other date as may be set forth in the notice of hearing), each 
party shall file all of its comments on the draft permit, based on 
information in the administrative record and any other information which 
is or reasonably could have been available to that party. All comments 
shall include any affidavits, studies, data, tests, or other materials 
relied upon for making any factual statements in the comments.
    (b)(1) Written comments filed under paragraph (a) of this section 
shall constitute the bulk of the evidence submitted at the hearing. Oral 
statements at the hearing should be brief and in the nature of argument. 
They shall be restricted either to points that could not have been made 
in written comments, or to emphasize points which are made in the 
comments, but which the party believes can more effectively be argued in 
the hearing context.
    (2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, within two weeks prior to the 
deadline specified in paragraph (a) of this section for the filing of 
comments, any party may move to submit all or part of its comments 
orally at the hearing in lieu of submitting written comments and the 
Presiding Officer shall, within one week, grant such motion if the 
Presiding Officer finds that the party will be prejudiced if required to 
submit the comments in written form.
    (c) Parties to any hearing may submit written material in response 
to the comments filed by other parties under paragraph (a) of this 
section at the time they appear at the panel stage of the hearing under 
Sec. 124.120.


<R05>
Sec. 124.119  Presiding Officer.

    (a)(1)(i) Before giving notice of a hearing under this subpart in a 
proceeding involving an NPDES permit, the Regional Administrator shall 
request that the Chief Administrative Law Judge assign an Administrative 
Law Judge as the Presiding Officer. The Chief Administrative Law Judge 
shall then make the assignment.
    (ii) If all parties to such a hearing waive in writing their 
statutory right to have an Administrative Law Judge named as the 
Presiding Officer in a hearing subject to this subparagraph the Regional 
Administrator may name a Presiding Officer under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of 
this section.
    (2) Before giving notice of a hearing under this subpart in a 
proceeding which does not involve an NPDES permit or a RCRA permit 
termination, the Regional Administrator shall either:
    (i) Request that the Chief Administrative Law Judge assign an 
Administrative Law Judge as the Presiding Officer. The Chief 
Administrative Law Judge may thereupon make such an assignment if he 
concludes that the other duties of his office allow, or
    (ii) Name a lawyer permanently or temporarily employed by the Agency 
and without prior connection with the proceeding to serve as Presiding 
Officer;
    (iii) If the Chief Administrative Law Judge declines to name an 
Administrative Law Judge as Presiding Officer upon receiving a request 
under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the Regional Administrator 
shall name a Presiding Officer under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section.
    (b) It shall be the duty of the Presiding Officer to conduct a fair 
and impartial hearing. The Presiding Officer shall have the authority:
    (1) Conferred by Sec. 124.85(b)(1)-(15), Sec. 124.83 (b) and (c), 
and;
    (2) To receive relevant evidence, provided that all comments under 
Secs. 124.113 and 124.118, the record of the panel hearing under 
Sec. 124.120, and the administrative record, as defined in Sec. 124.9 or 
in Sec. 124.18 as the case may be shall be received in evidence, and

[[Page 534]]

    (3) Either upon motion or sua sponte, to change the date of the 
hearing under Sec. 124.120, or to recess such a hearing until a future 
date. In any such case the notice required by Sec. 124.10 shall be 
given.
    (c) Whenever a panel hearing will be held on an individual draft 
NPDES permit for a source which does not have an existing permit, the 
Presiding Officer, on motion by the source, may issue an order 
authorizing it to begin discharging if it complies with all conditions 
of the draft permit or such other conditions as may be imposed by the 
Presiding Officer in consultation with the panel. The motion shall be 
granted if no party opposes it, or if the source demonstrates that:
    (1) It is likely to receive a permit to discharge at that site;
    (2) The environment will not be irreparably harmed if the source is 
allowed to begin discharging in compliance with the conditions of the 
Presiding Officer's order pending final agency action; and
    (3) Its discharge pending final agency action is in the public 
interest.
    (d) If for any offshore or coastal mobile exploratory drilling rig 
or coastal mobile developmental drilling rig which has never received a 
finally effective permit to discharge at a ``site,'' but which is not a 
``new discharger'' or ``new source,'' the Regional Administrator finds 
that compliance with certain permit conditions may be necessary to avoid 
irreparable environmental harm during the nonadversary panel procedures, 
he may specify in the statement of basis or fact sheet that those 
conditions, even if contested, shall remain enforceable obligations of 
the discharger during administrative review unless otherwise modified by 
the Presiding Officer under paragraph (c) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 124.120  Panel hearing.

    (a) A Presiding Officer shall preside at each hearing held under 
this subpart. An EPA panel shall also take part in the hearing. The 
panel shall consist of three or more EPA temporary or permanent 
employees having special expertise or responsibility in areas related to 
the hearing issue, none of whom shall have taken part in formulating the 
draft permit. If appropriate for the evaluation of new or different 
issues presented at the hearing, the panel membership, at the discretion 
of the Regional Administrator, may change or may include persons not 
employed by EPA.
    (b) At the time of the hearing notice under Sec. 124.116, the 
Regional Administrator shall designate the persons who shall serve as 
panel members for the hearing and the Regional Administrator shall file 
with the Regional Hearing Clerk the name and address of each person so 
designated. The Regional Administrator may also designate EPA employees 
who will provide staff support to the panel but who may or may not serve 
as panel members. The designated persons shall be subject to the ex 
parte rules in Sec. 124.78. The Regional Administrator may also 
designate Agency trial staff as defined in Sec. 124.78 for the hearing.
    (c) At any time before the close of the hearing the Presiding 
Officer, after consultation with the panel, may request that any person 
having knowledge concerning the issues raised in the hearing and not 
then scheduled to participate therein appear and testify at the hearing.
    (d) The panel members may question any person participating in the 
panel hearing. Cross-examination by persons other than panel members 
shall not be permitted at this stage of the proceeding except when the 
Presiding Officer determines, after consultation with the panel, that 
the cross-examination would expedite consideration of the issues. 
However, the parties may submit written questions to the Presiding 
Officer for the Presiding Officer to ask the participants, and the 
Presiding Officer may, after consultation with the panel, and at his or 
her sole discretion, ask these questions.
    (e) At any time before the close of the hearing, any party may 
submit to the Presiding Officer written questions

[[Page 535]]

specifically directed to any person appearing or testifying in the 
hearing. The Presiding Officer, after consultation with the panel may, 
at his sole discretion, ask the written question so submitted.
    (f) Within 10 days after the close of the hearing, any party shall 
submit such additional written testimony, affidavits, information, or 
material as they consider relevant or which the panel may request. These 
additional submissions shall be filed with the Regional Hearing Clerk 
and shall be a part of the hearing record.

[48 FR 14264, Apr. 1, 1983, as amended at 49 FR 38052, Sept. 26, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 124.121  Opportunity for cross-examination.

    (a) Any party to a panel hearing may submit a written request to 
cross-examine any issue of material fact. The motion shall be submitted 
to the Presiding Officer within 15 days after a full transcript of the 
panel hearing is filed with the Regional Hearing Clerk and shall 
specify:
    (1) The disputed issue(s) of material fact. This shall include an 
explanation of why the questions at issue are factual, the extent to 
which they are in dispute in light of the then existing record, and the 
extent to which they are material to the decision on the application; 
and
    (2) The person(s) to be cross-examined, and an estimate of the time 
necessary to conduct the cross-examination. This shall include a 
statement explaining how the cross-examination will resolve the disputed 
issues of material fact.
    (b) After receipt of all motions for cross-examination under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the Presiding Officer, after consultation 
with the hearing panel, shall promptly issue an order either granting or 
denying each request. No cross-examination shall be allowed on questions 
of policy except to the extent required to disclose the factual basis 
for permit requirements, or on questions of law, or regarding matters 
(such as the validity of effluent limitations guidelines) that are not 
subject to challenge in permit issuance proceedings. Orders granting 
requests for cross-examination shall be served on all parties and shall 
specify:
    (1) The issues on which cross-examination is granted;
    (2) The persons to be cross-examined on each issue;
    (3) The persons allowed to conduct cross-examination;
    (4) Time limits for the examination of witnesses by each cross-
examiner; and
    (5) The date, time, and place of the supplementary hearing at which 
cross-examination shall take place.
    (6) In issuing this order, the Presiding Officer may determine that 
two or more parties have the same or similar interests and that to 
prevent unduly repetitious cross-examination, they should be required to 
choose a single representative for purposes of cross-examination. In 
that case, the order shall simply assign time for cross-examination 
without further identifying the representative. If the designated 
parties fail to choose a single representative, the Presiding Officer 
may divide the assigned time among the representatives or issue any 
other order which justice may require.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) The Presiding Officer and, to the extent possible, the members 
of the hearing panel shall be present at the supplementary hearing. 
During the course of the hearing, the Presiding Officer shall have 
authority to modify any order issued under paragraph (b) of this 
section. A record will be made under Sec. 124.87.
    (e)(1) No later than the time set for requesting cross-examination, 
a party may request that alternative methods of clarifying the record 
(such as the submission of additional written information) be used in 
lieu of or in addition to cross-examination. The Presiding Officer shall 
issue an order granting or denying this request at the time he or she 
issues (or would have issued) an order granting or denying a request for 
cross-examination, under paragraph (b) of this section. If the request 
for an alternative method is granted, the order shall specify the 
alternative and any other relevant information (such as the due date for 
submitting written information).

[[Page 536]]

    (2) In passing on any request for cross-examination submitted under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the Presiding Officer may, as a 
precondition to ruling on the merits of the request, require alternative 
means of clarifying the record to be used whether or not a request to do 
so has been made. The party requesting cross-examination shall have one 
week to comment on the results of using the alternative method. After 
considering these comments the Presiding Officer shall issue an order 
granting or denying the request for cross-examination.
    (f) The provisions of Secs. 124.85(d)(2) and 124.84(e) apply to 
proceedings under this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 124.122  Record for final permit.

    The record on which the final permit shall be based in any 
proceeding under this subpart consists of:
    (a) The administrative record compiled under Sec. 124.9 or 
Sec. 124.18 as the case may be;
    (b) Any material submitted under Sec. 124.78 relating to ex parte 
contacts;
    (c) All notices issued under Sec. 124.113;
    (d) All requests for hearings, and rulings on those requests, 
received or issued under Sec. 124.114;
    (e) Any notice of hearing issued under Sec. 124.116;
    (f) Any request to participate in the hearing received under 
Sec. 124.117;
    (g) All comments submitted under Sec. 124.118, any motions made 
under that section and the rulings on them, and any comments filed under 
Sec. 124.113;
    (h) The full transcript and other material received into the record 
of the panel hearing under Sec. 124.120;
    (i) Any motions for, or rulings on, cross-examination filed or 
issued under Sec. 124.121;
    (j) Any motions for, orders for, and the results of, any 
alternatives to cross-examination under Sec. 124.121; and
    (k) The full transcript of any cross-examination held.


<R05>
Sec. 124.123  Filing of brief, proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and proposed modified permit.

    Unless otherwise ordered by the Presiding Officer, each party may, 
within 20 days after all requests for cross-examination are denied or 
after a transcript of the full hearing including any cross-examination 
becomes available, submit proposed findings of fact; conclusions 
regarding material issues of law, fact, or discretion; a proposed 
modified permit (if such person is urging that the draft or final permit 
be modified); and a brief in support thereof; together with references 
to relevant pages of transcript and to relevant exhibits. Within 10 days 
thereafter each party may file a reply brief concerning matters 
contained in opposing briefs and containing alternative findings of 
fact; conclusions regarding material issues of law, fact, or discretion; 
and a proposed modified permit where appropriate. Oral argument may be 
held at the discretion of the Presiding Officer on motion of any party 
or sua sponte.


<R05>
Sec. 124.124  Recommended decision.

    The person named to prepare the decision shall, as soon as 
practicable after the conclusion of the hearing, evaluate the record of 
the hearing and prepare and file a recommended decision with the 
Regional Hearing Clerk. That person may consult with, and receive 
assistance from, any member of the hearing panel in drafting the 
recommended decision, and may delegate the preparation of the 
recommended decision to the panel or to any member or members of it. 
This decision shall contain findings of fact, conclusions regarding all 
material issues of law, and a recommendation as to whether and in what 
respect the draft or final permit should be modified. After the 
recommended decision has been filed, the Regional Hearing Clerk shall 
serve a copy of that decision on each party and upon the Environmental 
Appeals Board.

[48 FR 14264, Apr. 1, 1983, as amended at 57 FR 5337, Feb. 13, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 124.125  Appeal from or review of recommended decision.

    Within 30 days after service of the recommended decision, any party 
may take exception to any matter set forth in that decision or to any 
adverse order or ruling of the Presiding Officer to

[[Page 537]]

which that party objected, and may appeal those exceptions to the 
Environmental Appeals Board as provided in Sec. 124.91, except that 
references to the initial decision will mean recommended decision under 
Sec. 124.124.

[57 FR 5337, Feb. 13, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 124.126  Final decision.

    As soon as practicable after all appeal proceedings have been 
completed, the Environmental Appeals Board shall issue a final decision. 
The Environmental Appeals Board may consult with the Presiding Officer, 
members of the hearing panel, or any other EPA employee other than 
members of the Agency Trial Staff under Sec. 124.78 in preparing the 
final decision. The Hearing Clerk shall file a copy of the decision on 
all parties.

[57 FR 5337, Feb. 13, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 124.127  Final decision if there is no review.

    If no party appeals a recommended decision to the Environmental 
Appeals Board, and if the Environmental Appeals Board does not elect to 
review it, the recommended decision becomes the final decision of the 
Agency upon the expiration of the time for filing any appeals.

[57 FR 5337, Feb. 13, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 124.128  Delegation of authority; time limitations.

    (a) The Administrator delegates authority to the Environmental 
Appeals Board (which is described in Sec. 1.25 of this title) to issue 
final decisions in appeals filed under this subpart. An appeal directed 
to the Administrator, rather than to the Environmental Appeals Board, 
will not be considered. This delegation does not preclude the 
Environmental Appeals Board from referring an appeal or a motion filed 
under this subpart to the Administrator when the Environmental Appeals 
Board, in its discretion, deems it appropriate to do so. When an appeal 
or motion is referred to the Administrator by the Environmental Appeals 
Board, all parties shall be so notified and the rules in this subpart 
referring to the Environmental Appeals Board shall be interpreted as 
referring to the Administrator.
    (b) The failure of the Environmental Appeals Board, the Regional 
Administrator, or the Presiding Officer to do any act within the time 
periods specified under this part shall not waive or diminish any right, 
power, or authority of the United States Environmental Protection 
Agency.
    (c) Upon a showing by any party that it has been prejudiced by a 
failure of the Environmental Appeals Board, the Regional Administrator, 
or the Presiding Officer to do any act within the time periods specified 
under this part, the Environmental Appeals Board, the Regional 
Administrator, and the Presiding Officer, as the case may be, may grant 
that party such relief of a procedural nature (including extension of 
any time for compliance or other action) as may be appropriate.

     Appendix A to Part 124--Guide to Decisionmaking Under Part 124

    This appendix is designed to assist in reading the procedural 
requirements set out in part 124. It consists of two flow charts.
    Figure 1 diagrams the more conventional sequence of procedures EPA 
expects to follow in processing permits under this part. It outlines how 
a permit will be applied for, how a draft permit will be prepared and 
publicly noticed for comment, and how a final permit will be issued 
under the procedures in subpart A.
    This permit may then be appealed to the Administrator, as specified 
both in subpart A (for RCRA, UIC, or PSD permits), or subpart E or F 
(for NPDES permits). The first flow chart also briefly outlines which 
permit decisions are eligible for which types of appeal.
    Part 124 also contains special ``non-adversary panel hearing'' 
procedures based on the ``initial licensing'' provisions of the 
Administrative Procedure Act. These procedures are set forth in subpart 
F. In some cases, EPA may only decide to make those procedures 
applicable after it has gone through the normal subpart A procedures on 
a draft permit. This process is also diagrammed in Figure 1.
    Figure 2 sets forth the general procedure to be followed where these 
subpart F procedures have been made applicable to a permit from the 
beginning.
    Both flow charts outline a sequence of events directed by arrows. 
The boxes set forth elements of the permit process; and the

[[Page 538]]

diamonds indicate key decisionmaking points in the permit process.
    The charts are discussed in more detail below.

            Figure 1--Conventional EPA Permitting Procedures

    This chart outlines the procedures for issuing permits whenever EPA 
does not make use of the special ``panel hearing'' procedures in subpart 
F. The major steps depicted on this chart are as follows:
    1. The permit process can begin in any one of the following ways:
    a. Normally, the process will begin when a person applies for a 
permit under Secs. 122.21 (NPDES), 144.31 (UIC), 233.4 (404), and 270.10 
(RCRA) and 124.3.
    b. In other cases, EPA may decide to take action on its own 
initiative to change a permit or to issue a general permit. This leads 
directly to preparation of a draft permit under Sec. 124.6.
    c. In addition, the permittee or any interested person (other than 
for PSD permits) may request modification, revocation and reissuance or 
termination of a permit under Secs. 122.62, 122.64 (NPDES), 144.39, 
144.40 (UIC), 233.14, 233.15, (404), 270.41, 270.43 (RCRA), and 124.5.
    Those requests can be handled in either of two ways:
    i. EPA may tentatively decide to grant the request and issue a new 
draft permit for public comment, either with or without requiring a new 
application.
    ii. If the request is denied, an informal appeal to the 
Environmental Appeals Board is available.
    2. The next major step in the permit process is the preparation of a 
draft permit. As the chart indicates, preparing a draft permit also 
requires preparation of either a statement of basis (Sec. 124.7), a fact 
sheet (Sec. 124.5) or, compilation of an ``administrative record'' 
(Sec. 124.9), and public notice (Sec. 124.10).
    3. The next stage is the public comment period (Sec. 124.11). A 
public hearing under Sec. 124.12 may be requested before the close of 
the public comment period.
    EPA has the discretion to hold a public hearing, even if there were 
no requests during the public comment period. If EPA decides to schedule 
one, the public comment period will be extended through the close of the 
hearing. EPA also has the discretion to conduct the public hearing under 
subpart F panel procedures. (See Figure 2.)
    The regulations provide that all arguments and factual materials 
that a person wishes EPA to consider in connection with a particular 
permit must be placed in the record by the close of the public comment 
period (Sec. 124.13).
    4. Section 124.14 states that EPA, at any time before issuing a 
final permit decision may decide to either reopen or extend the comment 
period, prepare a new draft permit and begin the process again from that 
point, or for RCRA and UIC permits, or for NPDES permits that constitute 
``initial licensing'', to begin ``panel hearing'' proceedings under 
subpart F. These various results are shown schematically.
    5. The public comment period and any public hearing will be followed 
by issuance of a final permit decision (Sec. 124.15). As the chart 
shows, the final permit must be accompanied by a response to comments 
(Sec. 124.17) and be based on the administrative record (Sec. 124.18).
    6. After the final permit is issued, it may be appealed to higher 
agency authority. The exact form of the appeal depends on the type of 
permit involved.
    a. RCRA, UIC, or PSD permits standing alone will be appealed 
directly to the Environmental Appeals Board under Sec. 124.9.
    b. NPDES permits which do not involve ``initial licensing'' may be 
appealed in an evidentiary hearing under subpart E. The regulations 
provide (Sec. 124.74) that if such a hearing is granted for an NPDES 
permit and if RCRA or UIC permits have been consolidated with that 
permit under Sec. 124.4 then closely related conditions of those RCRA or 
UIC permits may be reexamined in an evidentiary hearing. PSD permits, 
however, may never be reexamined in a subpart E hearing.
    c. NPDES permits which do involve ``initial licensing'' may be 
appealed in a panel hearing under subpart F. The regulations provide 
that if such a hearing is granted for an NPDES permit, consolidated 
RCRA, UIC, or PSD permits may also be reexamined in the same proceeding.
    As discussed below, this is only one of several ways the panel 
hearing procedures may be used under these regulations.
    7. This chart does not show EPA appeal procedures in detail. 
Procedures for appeal to the Environmental Appeals Board under 
Sec. 124.19 are self-explanatory; subpart F procedures are diagrammed in 
Figure 2; and subpart E procedures are basically the same that would 
apply in any evidentiary hearing.
    However, the chart at this stage does reflect the provisions of 
Sec. 124.60(b), which allows EPA, even after a formal hearing has begun, 
to ``recycle'' a permit back to the draft permit stage at any time 
before that hearing has resulted in an initial decision.

                Figure 2--Non-Adversary Panel Procedures

    This chart outlines the procedures for processing permits under the 
special ``panel hearing'' procedures of subpart F. These procedures were 
designed for making decisions that involve ``initial licensing'' NPDES 
permits. Those permits include the first decisions on an NPDES permit 
applied for by any discharger that has not previously held one, and the 
first decision on any statutory variance. In addition, these procedures 
will be

[[Page 539]]

used for any RCRA, UIC, or PSD permit which has been consolidated with 
such an NPDES permit, and may be used, if the Regional Administrator so 
chooses, for the issuance of individual RCRA or UIC permits. The steps 
depicted on this chart are as follows:
    1. Application for a permit. These proceedings will generally begin 
with an application, since NPDES initial licensing always will begin 
with an application.
    2. Preparation of a draft permit. This is identical to the similar 
step in Figure 1.
    3. Public comment period. This again is identical to the similar 
step in Figure 1. The Regional Administrator has the opportunity to 
schedule an informal public hearing under Sec. 124.12 during this 
period.
    4. Requests for a panel hearing must be received by the end of the 
public comment period under Sec. 124.113. The recommended decision may 
then be appealed to the Environmental Appeals Board. See Sec. 124.115.
    If a hearing request is denied, or if no hearing requests are 
received, a recommended decision will be issued based on the comments 
received. The recommended decision may then be appealed to the 
Administrator. See Sec. 124.115.
    5. If a hearing is granted, notice of the hearing will be published 
in accordance with Sec. 124.116 and will be followed by a second comment 
period during which requests to participate and the bulk of the 
remaining evidence for the final decision will be received 
(Secs. 124.117 and 124.118).
    The regulations also allow EPA to move directly to this stage by 
scheduling a hearing when the draft permit is prepared. In such cases 
the comment period on the draft permit under Sec. 124.113 and the 
prehearing comment period under Sec. 124.118 would occur at the same 
time. EPA anticipates that this will be the more frequent practice when 
permits are processed under panel procedures.
    This is also a stage at which EPA can switch from the conventional 
procedures diagramed in Figure 1 to the panel hearing procedures. As the 
chart indicates, EPA would do this by scheduling a panel hearing either 
through use of the ``recycle'' provision in Sec. 124.14 or in response 
to a request for a formal hearing under Sec. 124.74.
    6. After the close of the comment period, a panel hearing will be 
held under Sec. 124.120, followed by any cross-examination granted under 
Sec. 124.121. The recommended decision will then be prepared 
(Sec. 124.124) and an opportunity for appeal provided under 
Sec. 124.125. A final decision will be issued after appeal proceedings, 
if any, are concluded.

[45 FR 33512, May 19, 1980]



<R05>
Sec. 125.3  Technology-based treatment requirements in permits.

    (a) General. Technology-based treatment requirements under section 
301(b) of the Act represent the minimum level of control that must be 
imposed in a permit issued under section 402 of the Act. (See 
Secs. 122.41, 122.42 and 122.44 for a discussion of additional or more 
stringent effluent limitations and conditions.) Permits shall contain 
the following technology-based treatment requirements in accordance with 
the following statutory deadlines;
    (1) For POTW's, effluent limitations based upon:
    (i) Secondary treatment--from date of permit issuance; and
    (ii) The best practicable waste treatment technology--not later than 
July 1, 1983; and
    (2) For dischargers other than POTWs except as provided in 
Sec. 122.29(d), effluent limitations requiring:
    (i) The best practicable control technology currently available 
(BPT)--
    (A) For effluent limitations promulgated under Section 304(b) after 
January 1, 1982 and requiring a level of control substantially greater 
or based on fundamentally different control technology than under 
permits for an industrial category issued before such date, compliance 
as expeditiously as practicable but in no case later than three years 
after the date such limitations are promulgated under section 304(b) and 
in no case later than March 31, 1989;
    (B) For effluent limitations established on a case-by-case basis 
based on Best Professional Judgment (BPJ) under Section 402(a)(1)(B) of 
the Act in a permit issued after February 4, 1987, compliance as 
expeditiously as practicable but in no case later than three years after 
the date such limitations are established and in no case later than 
March 31, 1989;
    (C) For all other BPT effluent limitations compliance is required 
from the date of permit issuance.
    (ii) For conventional pollutants, the best conventional pollutant 
control technology (BCT)--
    (A) For effluent limitations promulgated under section 304(b), as 
expeditiously as practicable but in no case later than three years after 
the date such limitations are promulgated under section 304(b), and in 
no case later than March 31, 1989.
    (B) For effluent limitations established on a case-by-case (BPJ) 
basis under section 402(a)(1)(B) of the Act in a permit issued after 
February 4, 1987, compliance as expeditiously as practicable but in no 
case later than three years after the date such limitations are 
established and in no case later than March 31, 1989;
    (iii) For all toxic pollutants referred to in Committee Print No. 
95-30, House Committee on Public Works and Transportation, the best 
available technology economically achievable (BAT)--
    (A) For effluent limitations established under section 304(b), as 
expeditiously as practicable but in no case later than three years after 
the date such limitations are promulgated under section 304(b), and in 
no case later than March 31, 1989.
    (B) For permits issued on a case-by-case (BPJ) basis under section 
402(a)(1)(B) of the Act after February 4, 1987 establishing BAT effluent 
limitations, compliance is required as expeditiously as practicable but 
in no case later than three years after the

[[Page 545]]

date such limitations are promulgated under section 304(b), and in no 
case later than March 31, 1989.
    (iv) For all toxic pollutants other than those listed in Committee 
Print No. 95-30, effluent limitations based on BAT--
    (A) For effluent limitations promulgated under section 304(b) 
compliance is required as expeditiously as practicable, but in no case 
later than three years after the date such limitations are promulgated 
under section 304(b) and in no case later than March 31, 1989.
    (B) For permits issued on a case-by-case (BPJ) basis under Section 
402(a)(1)(B) of the Act after February 4, 1987 establishing BAT effluent 
limitations, compliance is required as expeditiously as practicable but 
in no case later than 3 years after the date such limitations are 
established and in no case later than March 31, 1989.
    (v) For all pollutants which are neither toxic nor conventional 
pollutants, effluent limitations based on BAT--
    (A) For effluent limitations promulgated under section 304(b), 
compliance is required as expeditiously as practicable but in no case 
later than 3 years after the date such limitations are established and 
in no case later than March 31, 1989.
    (B) For permits issued on a case-by-case (BPJ) basis under section 
402(a)(1)(B) of the Act after February 4, 1987 establishing BAT effluent 
limitations compliance is required as expeditiously as practicable but 
in no case later than three years after the date such limitations are 
established and in no case later than March 31, 1989.
    (b) Statutory variances and extensions. (1) The following variances 
from technology-based treatment requirements are authorized by the Act 
and may be applied for under Sec. 122.21;
    (i) For POTW's, a section 301(h) marine discharge variance from 
secondary treatment (subpart G);
    (ii) For dischargers other than POTW's;
    (A) A section 301(c) economic variance from BAT (subpart E);
    (B) A section 301(g) water quality related variance from BAT 
(subpart F); and
    (C) A section 316(a) thermal variance from BPT, BCT and BAT (subpart 
H).
    (2) The following extensions of deadlines for compliance with 
technology-based treatment requirements are authorized by the Act and 
may be applied for under Sec. 124.53:
    (i) For POTW's a section 301(i) extension of the secondary treatment 
deadline (subpart J);
    (ii) For dischargers other than POTW's:
    (A) A section 301(i) extension of the BPT deadline (subpart J); and
    (B) A section 301(k) extension of the BAT deadline (subpart C).
    (c) Methods of imposing technology-based treatment requirements in 
permits. Technology-based treatment requirements may be imposed through 
one of the following three methods:
    (1) Application of EPA-promulgated effluent limitations developed 
under section 304 of the Act to dischargers by category or subcategory. 
These effluent limitations are not applicable to the extent that they 
have been remanded or withdrawn. However, in the case of a court remand, 
determinations underlying effluent limitations shall be binding in 
permit issuance proceedings where those determinations are not required 
to be reexamined by a court remanding the regulations. In addition, 
dischargers may seek fundamentally different factors variances from 
these effluent limitations under Sec. 122.21 and subpart D of this part.
    (2) On a case-by-case basis under section 402(a)(1) of the Act, to 
the extent that EPA-promulgated effluent limitations are inapplicable. 
The permit writer shall apply the appropriate factors listed in 
Sec. 125.3(d) and shall consider:
    (i) The appropriate technology for the category or class of point 
sources of which the applicant is a member, based upon all available 
information; and
    (ii) Any unique factors relating to the applicant.

[Comment: These factors must be considered in all cases, regardless of 
whether the permit is being issued by EPA or an approved State.]

    (3) Through a combination of the methods in paragraphs (d) (1) and 
(2) of

[[Page 546]]

this section. Where promulgated effluent limitations guidelines only 
apply to certain aspects of the discharger's operation, or to certain 
pollutants, other aspects or activities are subject to regulation on a 
case-by-case basis in order to carry out the provisions of the Act.
    (4) Limitations developed under paragraph (d)(2) of this section may 
be expressed, where appropriate, in terms of toxicity (e.g., ``the 
LC<INF>50 for fat head minnow of the effluent from outfall 001 shall be 
greater than 25%''). Provided, That is shown that the limits reflect the 
appropriate requirements (for example, technology-based or water-
quality-based standards) of the Act.
    (d) In setting case-by-case limitations pursuant to Sec. 125.3(c), 
the permit writer must consider the following factors:
    (1) For BPT requirements: (i) The total cost of application of 
technology in relation to the effluent reduction benefits to be achieved 
from such application;
    (ii) The age of equipment and facilities involved;
    (iii) The process employed;
    (iv) The engineering aspects of the application of various types of 
control techniques;
    (v) Process changes; and
    (vi) Non-water quality environmental impact (including energy 
requirements).
    (2) For BCT requirements: (i) The reasonableness of the relationship 
between the costs of attaining a reduction in effluent and the effluent 
reduction benefits derived;
    (ii) The comparison of the cost and level of reduction of such 
pollutants from the discharge from publicly owned treatment works to the 
cost and level of reduction of such pollutants from a class or category 
of industrial sources;
    (iii) The age of equipment and facilities involved;
    (iv) The process employed;
    (v) The engineering aspects of the application of various types of 
control techniques;
    (vi) Process changes; and
    (vii) Non-water quality environmental impact (including energy 
requirements).
    (3) For BAT requirements: (i) The age of equipment and facilities 
involved;
    (ii) The process employed;
    (iii) The engineering aspects of the application of various types of 
control techniques;
    (iv) Process changes;
    (v) The cost of achieving such effluent reduction; and
    (vi) Non-water quality environmental impact (including energy 
requirements).
    (e) Technology-based treatment requirements are applied prior to or 
at the point of discharge.
    (f) Technology-based treatment requirements cannot be satisfied 
through the use of ``non-treatment'' techniques such as flow 
augmentation and in-stream mechanical aerators. However, these 
techniques may be considered as a method of achieving water quality 
standards on a case-by-case basis when:
    (1) The technology-based treatment requirements applicable to the 
discharge are not sufficient to achieve the standards;
    (2) The discharger agrees to waive any opportunity to request a 
variance under section 301 (c), (g) or (h) of the Act; and
    (3) The discharger demonstrates that such a technique is the 
preferred environmental and economic method to achieve the standards 
after consideration of alternatives such as advanced waste treatment, 
recycle and reuse, land disposal, changes in operating methods, and 
other available methods.
    (g) Technology-based effluent limitations shall be established under 
this subpart for solids, sludges, filter backwash, and other pollutants 
removed in the course of treatment or control of wastewaters in the same 
manner as for other pollutants.
    (h)(1) The Director may set a permit limit for a conventional 
pollutant at a level more stringent than the best conventional pollution 
control technology (BCT), or a limit for a nonconventional pollutant 
which shall not be subject to modification under section 301 (c) or (g) 
of the Act where:
    (i) Effluent limitations guidelines specify the pollutant as an 
indicator for a toxic pollutant, or
    (ii)(A) The limitation reflects BAT-level control of discharges of 
one or

[[Page 547]]

more toxic pollutants which are present in the waste stream, and a 
specific BAT limitation upon the toxic pollutant(s) is not feasible for 
economic or technical reasons;
    (B) The permit identifies which toxic pollutants are intended to be 
controlled by use of the limitation; and
    (C) The fact sheet required by Sec. 124.56 sets forth the basis for 
the limitation, including a finding that compliance with the limitation 
will result in BAT-level control of the toxic pollutant discharges 
identified in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, and a finding 
that it would be economically or technically infeasible to directly 
limit the toxic pollutant(s).
    (2) The Director may set a permit limit for a conventional pollutant 
at a level more stringent than BCT when:
    (i) Effluent limitations guidelines specify the pollutant as an 
indicator for a hazardous substance, or
    (ii)(A) The limitation reflects BAT-level control of discharges (or 
an appropriate level determined under section 301(c) or (g) of the Act) 
of one or more hazardous substance(s) which are present in the waste 
stream, and a specific BAT (or other appropriate) limitation upon the 
hazardous substance(s) is not feasible for economic or technical 
reasons;
    (B) The permit identifies which hazardous substances are intended to 
be controlled by use of the limitation; and
    (C) The fact sheet required by Sec. 124.56 sets forth the basis for 
the limitation, including a finding that compliance with the limitations 
will result in BAT-level (or other appropriate level) control of the 
hazardous substances discharges identified in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(B) of 
this section, and a finding that it would be economically or technically 
infeasible to directly limit the hazardous substance(s).
    (iii) Hazardous substances which are also toxic pollutants are 
subject to paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
    (3) The Director may not set a more stringent limit under the 
preceding paragraphs if the method of treatment required to comply with 
the limit differs from that which would be required if the toxic 
pollutant(s) or hazardous substance(s) controlled by the limit were 
limited directly.
    (4) Toxic pollutants identified under paragraph (h)(1) of this 
section remain subject to the requirements of Sec. 122.42(a)(1) 
(notification of increased discharges of toxic pollutants above levels 
reported in the application form).

   Subpart B--Criteria for Issuance of Permits to Aquaculture Projects


<R05>
Sec. 125.10  Purpose and scope.

    (a) These regulations establish guidelines under sections 318 and 
402 of the Act for approval of any discharge of pollutants associated 
with an aquaculture project.
    (b) The regulations authorize, on a selective basis, controlled 
discharges which would otherwise be unlawful under the Act in order to 
determine the feasibility of using pollutants to grow aquatic organisms 
which can be harvested and used beneficially. EPA policy is to encourage 
such projects, while at the same time protecting other beneficial uses 
of the waters.
    (c) Permits issued for discharges into aquaculture projects under 
this subpart are NPDES permits and are subject to the applicable 
requirements of parts 122, 123 and 124. Any permit shall include such 
conditions (including monitoring and reporting requirements) as are 
necessary to comply with those parts. Technology-based effluent 
limitations need not be applied to discharges into the approved project 
except with respect to toxic pollutants.



<R05>
Sec. 125.11  Criteria.

    (a) No NPDES permit shall be issued to an aquaculture project 
unless:
    (1) The Director determines that the aquaculture project:
    (i) Is intended by the project operator to produce a crop which has 
significant direct or indirect commercial value (or is intended to be 
operated for research

[[Page 548]]

into possible production of such a crop); and
    (ii) Does not occupy a designated project area which is larger than 
can be economically operated for the crop under cultivation or than is 
necessary for research purposes.
    (2) The applicant has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the 
Director, that the use of the pollutant to be discharged to the 
aquaculture project will result in an increased harvest of organisms 
under culture over what would naturally occur in the area;
    (3) The applicant has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the 
Director, that if the species to be cultivated in the aquaculture 
project is not indigenous to the immediate geographical area, there will 
be minimal adverse effects on the flora and fauna indigenous to the 
area, and the total commercial value of the introduced species is at 
least equal to that of the displaced or affected indigenous flora and 
fauna;
    (4) The Director determines that the crop will not have a 
significant potential for human health hazards resulting from its 
consumption;
    (5) The Director determines that migration of pollutants from the 
designated project area to water outside of the aquaculture project will 
not cause or contribute to a violation of water quality standards or a 
violation of the applicable standards and limitations applicable to the 
supplier of the pollutant that would govern if the aquaculture project 
were itself a point source. The approval of an aquaculture project shall 
not result in the enlargement of a pre-existing mixing zone area beyond 
what had been designated by the State for the original discharge.
    (b) No permit shall be issued for any aquaculture project in 
conflict with a plan or an amendment to a plan approved under section 
208(b) of the Act.
    (c) No permit shall be issued for any aquaculture project located in 
the territorial sea, the waters of the contiguous zone, or the oceans, 
except in conformity with guidelines issued under section 403(c) of the 
Act.
    (d) Designated project areas shall not include a portion of a body 
of water large enough to expose a substantial portion of the indigenous 
biota to the conditions within the designated project area. For example, 
the designated project area shall not include the entire width of a 
watercourse, since all organisms indigenous to that watercourse might be 
subjected to discharges of pollutants that would, except for the 
provisions of section 318 of the Act, violate section 301 of the Act.
    (e) Any modifications caused by the construction or creation of a 
reef, barrier or containment structure shall not unduly alter the tidal 
regimen of an estuary or interfere with migrations of unconfined aquatic 
species.

[Comment: Any modifications described in this paragraph which result in 
the discharge of dredged or fill material into navigable waters may be 
subject to the permit requirements of section 404 of the Act.]

    (f) Any pollutants not required by or beneficial to the aquaculture 
crop shall not exceed applicable standards and limitations when entering 
the designated project area.

    Subpart D--Criteria and Standards for Determining Fundamentally 
Different Factors Under Sections 301(b)(1)(A), 301(b)(2) (A) and (E) of 
                                 the Act


<R05>
Sec. 125.30  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart establishes the criteria and standards to be used 
in determining whether effluent limitations alternative to those 
required by promulgated EPA effluent limitations guidelines under 
sections 301 and 304 of the Act (hereinafter referred to as ``national 
limits'') should be imposed on a discharger because factors relating to 
the discharger's facilities, equipment, processes or other factors 
related to the discharger are fundamentally different from the factors 
considered by EPA in development of the national limits. This subpart 
applies to all national limitations promulgated under sections 301 and 
304 of the Act, except for the BPT limits contained in 40 CFR 423.12 
(steam electric generating point source category).

[[Page 549]]

    (b) In establishing national limits, EPA takes into account all the 
information it can collect, develop and solicit regarding the factors 
listed in sections 304(b) and 304(g) of the Act. In some cases, however, 
data which could affect these national limits as they apply to a 
particular discharge may not be available or may not be considered 
during their development. As a result, it may be necessary on a case-by-
case basis to adjust the national limits, and make them either more or 
less stringent as they apply to certain dischargers within an industrial 
category or subcategory. This will only be done if data specific to that 
discharger indicates it presents factors fundamentally different from 
those considered by EPA in developing the limit at issue. Any interested 
person believing that factors relating to a discharger's facilities, 
equipment, processes or other facilities related to the discharger are 
fundamentally different from the factors considered during development 
of the national limits may request a fundamentally different factors 
variance under Sec. 122.21(l)(1). In addition, such a variance may be 
proposed by the Director in the draft permit.

<R05>
Sec. 125.31  Criteria.

    (a) A request for the establishment of effluent limitations under 
this subpart (fundamentally different factors variance) shall be 
approved only if:
    (1) There is an applicable national limit which is applied in the 
permit and specifically controls the pollutant for which alternative 
effluent limitations or standards have been requested; and
    (2) Factors relating to the discharge controlled by the permit are 
fundamentally different from those considered by EPA in establishing the 
national limits; and
    (3) The request for alternative effluent limitations or standards is 
made in accordance with the procedural requirements of part 124.
    (b) A request for the establishment of effluent limitations less 
stringent than those required by national limits guidelines shall be 
approved only if:
    (1) The alternative effluent limitation or standard requested is no 
less stringent than justified by the fundamental difference; and
    (2) The alternative effluent limitation or standard will ensure 
compliance with sections 208(e) and 301(b)(1)(C) of the Act; and
    (3) Compliance with the national limits (either by using the 
technologies upon which the national limits are based or by other 
control alternatives) would result in:
    (i) A removal cost wholly out of proportion to the removal cost 
considered during development of the national limits; or
    (ii) A non-water quality environmental impact (including energy 
requirements) fundamentally more adverse than the impact considered 
during development of the national limits.
    (c) A request for alternative limits more stringent than required by 
national limits shall be approved only if:
    (1) The alternative effluent limitation or standard requested is no 
more stringent than justified by the fundamental difference; and
    (2) Compliance with the alternative effluent limitation or standard 
would not result in:
    (i) A removal cost wholly out of proportion to the removal cost 
considered during development of the national limits; or
    (ii) A non-water quality environmental impact (including energy 
requirements) fundamentally more adverse than the impact considered 
during development of the national limits.
    (d) Factors which may be considered fundamentally different are:

[[Page 550]]

    (1) The nature or quality of pollutants contained in the raw waste 
load of the applicant's process wastewater;

[Comment: (1) In determining whether factors concerning the discharger 
are fundamentally different, EPA will consider, where relevant, the 
applicable development document for the national limits, associated 
technical and economic data collected for use in developing each 
respective national limit, records of legal proceedings, and written and 
printed documentation including records of communication, etc., relevant 
to the development of respective national limits which are kept on 
public file by EPA.
    (2) Waste stream(s) associated with a discharger's process 
wastewater which were not considered in the development of the national 
limits will not ordinarily be treated as fundamentally different under 
paragraph (a) of this section. Instead, national limits should be 
applied to the other streams, and the unique stream(s) should be subject 
to limitations based on section 402(a)(1) of the Act. See 
Sec. 125.2(c)(2).]

    (2) The volume of the discharger's process wastewater and effluent 
discharged;
    (3) Non-water quality environmental impact of control and treatment 
of the discharger's raw waste load;
    (4) Energy requirements of the application of control and treatment 
technology;
    (5) Age, size, land availability, and configuration as they relate 
to the discharger's equipment or facilities; processes employed; process 
changes; and engineering aspects of the application of control 
technology;
    (6) Cost of compliance with required control technololgy.
    (e) A variance request or portion of such a request under this 
section shall not be granted on any of the following grounds:
    (1) The infeasibility of installing the required waste treatment 
equipment within the time the Act allows.

[Comment: Under this section a variance request may be approved if it is 
based on factors which relate to the discharger's ability ultimately to 
achieve national limits but not if it is based on factors which merely 
affect the discharger's ability to meet the statutory deadlines of 
sections 301 and 307 of the Act such as labor difficulties, construction 
schedules, or unavailability of equipment.]

    (2) The assertion that the national limits cannot be achieved with 
the appropriate waste treatment facilities installed, if such assertion 
is not based on factor(s) listed in paragraph (d) of this section;

[Comment: Review of the Administrator's action in promulgating national 
limits is available only through the judicial review procedures set 
forth in section 509(b) of the Act.]

    (3) The discharger's ability to pay for the required waste 
treatment; or
    (4) The impact of a discharge on local receiving water quality.
    (f) Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair the right 
of any State or locality under section 510 of the Act to impose more 
stringent limitations than those required by Federal law.


<R05>
Sec. 125.32  Method of application.

    (a) A written request for a variance under this subpart shall be 
submitted in duplicate to the Director in accordance with part 124, 
subpart F.
    (b) The burden is on the person requesting the variance to explain 
that:
    (1) Factor(s) listed in Sec. 125.31(b) regarding the discharger's 
facility are fundamentally different from the factors EPA considered in 
establishing the national limits. The requester should refer to all 
relevant material and information, such as the published guideline 
regulations development document, all associated technical and economic 
data collected for use in developing each national limit, all records of 
legal proceedings, and all written and printed documentation including 
records of communication, etc., relevant to the

[[Page 551]]

regulations which are kept on public file by the EPA;
    (2) The alternative limitations requested are justified by the 
fundamental difference alleged in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and
    (3) The appropriate requirements of Sec. 125.31 have been met.

               Under Section 301(h) of the Clean Water Act

    Authority: Clean Water Act, as amended by the Clean Water Act of 
1977, 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq., unless otherwise noted.

    Source: 59 FR 40658, Aug. 9, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 125.56  Scope and purpose.

    This subpart establishes the criteria to be applied by EPA in acting 
on section 301(h) requests for modifications to the secondary treatment 
requirements. It also establishes special permit conditions which must 
be included in any permit incorporating a section 301(h) modification of 
the secondary treatment requirements (``section 301(h) modified 
permit'').


<R05>
Sec. 125.57  Law governing issuance of a section 301(h) modified permit.

    (a) Section 301(h) of the Clean Water Act provides that:

    Administrator, with the concurrence of the State, may issue a permit 
under section 402 which modifies the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(B) 
of this section with respect to the discharge of any pollutant from a 
publicly owned treatment works into marine waters, if the applicant 
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that--
    (1) There is an applicable water quality standard specific to the 
pollutant for which the modification is requested, which has been 
identified under section 304(a)(6) of this Act;
    (2) The discharge of pollutants in accordance with such modified 
requirements will not interfere, alone or in combination with pollutants 
from other sources, with the attainment or maintenance of that water 
quality which assures protection of public water supplies and protection 
and propagation of a balanced indigenous population of shellfish, fish, 
and wildlife, and allows recreational activities, in and on the water;
    (3) The applicant has established a system for monitoring the impact 
of such discharge on a representative sample of aquatic biota, to the 
extent practicable, and the scope of such monitoring is limited to 
include only those scientific investigations which are necessary to 
study the effects of the proposed discharge;
    (4) Such modified requirements will not result in any additional 
requirements on any other point or nonpoint source;
    (5) All applicable pretreatment requirements for sources introducing 
waste into such treatment works will be enforced;
    (6) In the case of any treatment works serving a population of 
50,000 or more, with respect to any toxic pollutant introduced into such 
works by an industrial discharger for which pollutant there is no 
applicable pretreatment requirement in effect, sources introducing waste 
into such works are in compliance with all applicable pretreatment 
requirements, the applicant will enforce such requirements, and the 
applicant has in effect a pretreatment program which, in combination 
with the treatment of discharges from such works, removes the same 
amount of such pollutant as would be removed if such works were to apply 
secondary treatment to discharges and if such works had no pretreatment 
program with respect to such pollutant;
    (7) To the extent practicable, the applicant has established a 
schedule of activities designed to eliminate the entrance of toxic 
pollutants from nonindustrial sources into such treatment works;
    (8) There will be no new or substantially increased discharges from 
the point source of the pollutant to which the modification applies 
above that volume of discharge specified in the permit;
    (9) The applicant at the time such modification becomes effective 
will be discharging effluent which has received at least primary or 
equivalent treatment and which meets the criteria established under 
section 304(a)(1) of this Act after initial mixing in the waters 
surrounding or adjacent to the point at which such effluent is 
discharged.
    For the purposes of this section, the phrase ``the discharge of any 
pollutant into marine waters'' refers to a discharge into deep waters of 
the territorial sea or the waters of

[[Page 552]]

the contiguous zone, or into saline estuarine waters where there is 
strong tidal movement and other hydrological and geological 
characteristics which the Administrator determines necessary to allow 
compliance with paragraph (2) of this section, and section 101(a)(2) of 
this Act. For the purposes of paragraph (9), ``primary or equivalent 
treatment'' means treatment by screening, sedimentation, and skimming 
adequate to remove at least 30 percent of the biological oxygen 
demanding material and of the suspended solids in the treatment works 
influent, and disinfection, where appropriate. A municipality which 
applies secondary treatment shall be eligible to receive a permit 
pursuant to this subsection which modifies the requirements of paragraph 
(b)(1)(B) of this section with respect to the discharge of any pollutant 
from any treatment works owned by such municipality into marine waters. 
No permit issued under this subsection shall authorize the discharge of 
sewage sludge into marine waters. In order for a permit to be issued 
under this subsection for the discharge of a pollutant into marine 
waters, such marine waters must exhibit characteristics assuring that 
water providing dilution does not contain significant amounts of 
previously discharged effluent from such treatment works. No permit 
issued under this subsection shall authorize the discharge of any 
pollutant into saline estuarine waters which at the time of application 
do not support a balanced indigenous population of shellfish, fish, and 
wildlife, or allow recreation in and on the waters or which exhibit 
ambient water quality below applicable water quality standards adopted 
for the protection of public water supplies, shellfish, fish, and 
wildlife or recreational activities or such other standards necessary to 
assure support and protection of such uses. The prohibition contained in 
the preceding sentence shall apply without regard to the presence or 
absence of a causal relationship between such characteristics and the 
applicant's current or proposed discharge. Notwithstanding any other 
provisions of this subsection, no permit may be issued under this 
subsection for discharge of a pollutant into the New York Bight Apex 
consisting of the ocean waters of the Atlantic Ocean westward of 73 
degrees 30 minutes west longitude and northward of 40 degrees 10 minutes 
north latitude.

    (b) Section 301(j)(1) of the Clean Water Act provides that:

    Any application filed under this section for a modification of the 
provisions of--
    (A) subsection (b)(1)(B) under subsection (h) of this section shall 
be filed not later than the 365th day which begins after the date of 
enactment of the Municipal Wastewater Treatment Construction Grant 
Amendments of 1981, except that a publicly owned treatment works which 
prior to December 31, 1982, had a contractual arrangement to use a 
portion of the capacity of an ocean outfall operated by another publicly 
owned treatment works which has applied for or received modification 
under subsection (h) may apply for a modification of subsection (h) in 
its own right not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of 
the Water Quality Act of 1987.

    (c) Section 22(e) of the Municipal Wastewater Treatment Construction 
Grant Amendments of 1981, Public Law 97-117, provides that:

    The amendments made by this section shall take effect on the date of 
enactment of this Act except that no applicant, other than the city of 
Avalon, California, who applies after the date of enactment of this Act 
for a permit pursuant to subsection (h) of section 301 of the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act which modifies the requirements of 
subsection (b)(1)(B) of section 301 of such Act shall receive such 
permit during the one-year period which begins on the date of enactment 
of this Act.

    (d) Section 303(b)(2) of the Water Quality Act, Public Law 100-4, 
provides that:

    Section 301(h)(3) shall only apply to modifications and renewals of 
modifications which are tentatively or finally approved after the date 
of the enactment of this Act.

    (e) Section 303(g) of the Water Quality Act provides that:

    The amendments made to sections 301(h) and (h)(2), as well as 
provisions of (h)(6) and (h)(9), shall not apply to an application for a 
permit under section 301(h) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act 
which has been tentatively or finally approved by the Administrator 
before the date of the enactment of this Act; except that such 
amendments shall apply to all renewals of such permits after such date 
of enactment.

Sec. 125.59  General.

    (a) Basis for application. An application under this subpart shall 
be based on a current, improved, or altered discharge into ocean waters 
or saline estuarine waters.
    (b) Prohibitions. No section 301(h) modified permit shall be issued:
    (1) Where such issuance would not assure compliance with all 
applicable requirements of this subpart and part 122;
    (2) For the discharge of sewage sludge;
    (3) Where such issuance would conflict with applicable provisions of 
State, local, or other Federal laws or Executive Orders. This includes 
compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended, 16 
U.S.C. 1451 et seq.; the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, 16

estuarine waters which at the time of application do not support a 
balanced indigenous population of shellfish, fish, and wildlife, or 
allow recreation in and on the waters or which exhibit ambient water 
quality below applicable water quality standards adopted for the 
protection of public water supplies, shellfish, fish, and wildlife or 
recreational activities or

[[Page 555]]

such other standards necessary to assure support and protection of such 
uses. The prohibition contained in the preceding sentence shall apply 
without regard to the presence or absence of a causal relationship 
between such characteristics and the applicant's current or proposed 
discharge; or
    (5) Where the discharge of any pollutant is into the New York Bight 
Apex.
    (c) Applications. Each applicant for a modified permit under this 
subpart shall submit an application to EPA signed in compliance with 40 
CFR part 122, subpart B, which shall contain:

in Sec. 125.59(f)(1) either within one year of the date of EPA's 
tentative decision on their original application or within one year of 
November 26, 1982, if a tentative decision has already been made, 
whichever is later.
    (ii) Applicants desiring to revise their applications under 
Sec. 125.59(d)(3) must submit the revised application as described for 
new applications in Sec. 125.59(f)(1) concurrent with submission of the 
additional information under Sec. 125.59(g).
    (3) Deadline for additional information to demonstrate compliance 
with Secs. 125.60 and 125.65.
    (i) A letter of intent required under Sec. 125.59(e)(1) must be 
submitted by the following dates: for permittees with 301(h) 
modifications or for applicants to which a tentative or final decision 
has been issued, November 7, 1994; for all others, within 90 days after 
the Administrator issues a tentative decision on an application. 
Following receipt by EPA of a letter of intent containing the 
information required in Sec. 125.59(e)(1), further EPA proceedings on 
the tentative decision under 40 CFR part 124 will be stayed.
    (ii) The project plan submitted under Sec. 125.59(e)(1) shall ensure 
that the applicant meets all the requirements of Secs. 125.60 and 125.65 
by the following deadlines:
    (A) By August 9, 1996 for applicants that are not grandfathered 
under Sec. 125.59(j).
    (B) At the time of permit renewal or by August 9, 1996, whichever is 
later, for applicants that are grandfathered under Sec. 125.59(j).
    (4) State determination deadline. State determinations, as required 
by Secs. 125.61(b)(2) and 125.64(b) shall be filed by the applicant with 
the appropriate Regional Administrator no later than 90 days after 
submission of the revision to the application or additional information 
to EPA. Extensions to this

[[Page 557]]

deadline may be provided by EPA upon request. However, EPA will not 
begin review of the revision to the application or additional 
information until a favorable State determination is received by EPA. 
Failure to provide the State determination within the timeframe required 
by this paragraph (f)(4) is a basis for denial of the application.
    (g)(1) The Administrator may authorize or request an applicant to 
submit additional information by a specified date not to exceed one year 
from the date of authorization or request.
    (2) Applicants seeking authorization to submit additional 
information on current/modified discharge characteristics, water 
quality, biological conditions or oceanographic characteristics must:
    (i) Demonstrate that they made a diligent effort to provide such 
information with their application and were unable to do so, and
    (ii) Submit a plan of study, including a schedule, for data 
collection and submittal of the additional information. EPA will review 
the plan of study and may require revisions prior to authorizing 
submission of the additional information.
    (h) Tentative decisions on section 301(h) modifications. The 
Administrator shall grant a tentative approval or a tentative denial of 
a section 301(h) modified permit application. To qualify for a tentative 
approval, the applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator that it is using good faith means to come into compliance 
with all the requirements of this subpart and that it will meet all such 
requirements based on a schedule approved by the Administrator. For 
compliance with Secs. 125.60 and 125.65, such schedule shall be in 
accordance with Sec. 125.59(f)(3)(ii).
    (i) Decisions on section 301(h) modifications. (1) The decision to 
grant or deny a section 301(h) modification shall be made by the 
Administrator and shall be based on the applicant's demonstration that 
it has met all the requirements of Secs. 125.59 through 125.68.
    (2) No section 301(h) modified permit shall be issued until the 
appropriate State certification/concurrence is granted or waived 
pursuant to Sec. 124.54 or if the State denies certification/ 
concurrence pursuant to Sec. 124.54.
    (3) In the case of a modification issued to an applicant in a State 
administering an approved permit program under 40 CFR part 123, the 
State Director may:
    (i) Revoke an existing permit as of the effective date of the EPA 
issued section 301(h) modified permit; and
    (ii) Cosign the section 301(h) modified permit if the Director has 
indicated an intent to do so in the written concurrence.
    (4) Any section 301(h) modified permit shall:
    (i) Be issued in accordance with the procedures set forth in 40 CFR 
part 124, except that, because section 301(h) permits may be issued only 
by EPA, the terms ``Administrator or a person designated by the 
Administrator'' shall be substituted for the term ``Director'' as 
appropriate; and
    (ii) Contain all applicable terms and conditions set forth in 40 CFR 
part 122 and Sec. 125.68.
    (5) Appeals of section 301(h) determinations shall be governed by 
the procedures in 40 CFR part 124.
    (j) Grandfathering provision. Applicants that received tentative or 
final approval for a section 301(h) modified permit prior to February 4, 
1987, are not subject to Sec. 125.60, the water quality criteria 
provisions of Sec. 125.62(a)(1), or Sec. 125.65 until the time of permit 
renewal. In addition, if permit renewal will occur prior to August 9, 
1996, applicants may have additional time to come into compliance with 
Secs. 125.60 and 125.65, as determined appropriate by EPA on a case-by-
case basis. Such additional time, however, shall not extend beyond 
August 9, 1996. This paragraph does not apply to any application that 
was initially tentatively approved, but as to which EPA withdrew its 
tentative approval or issued a tentative denial prior to February 4, 
1987.


<R05>
Sec. 125.60  Primary or equivalent treatment requirements.

    (a) The applicant shall demonstrate that, at the time its 
modification becomes effective, it will be discharging effluent that has 
received at least primary or equivalent treatment.

[[Page 558]]

    (b) The applicant shall perform monitoring to ensure, based on the 
monthly average results of the monitoring, that the effluent it 
discharges has received primary or equivalent treatment.
    (c)(1) An applicant may request that the demonstration of compliance 
with the requirement under Sec. 125.60(b) to provide 30 percent removal 
of BOD be allowed on an averaging basis different from monthly (e.g., 
quarterly), subject to the demonstrations provided in paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section. If, however, the applicant has demonstrated an ability 
to achieve 30 percent removal of BOD on a monthly average basis over the 
calendar year prior to August 9, 1994, the applicant shall not be 
eligible for an averaging basis longer than monthly.
    (2) If the Administrator is satisfied that the applicant has met the 
eligibility requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the 
Administrator may approve such requests if the applicant demonstrates to 
the Administrator's satisfaction that:
    (i) The applicant's POTW is adequately designed and well operated;
    (ii) The applicant will be able to meet all requirements under 
section 301(h) of the CWA and these subpart G regulations with the 
averaging basis selected; and
    (iii) The applicant cannot achieve 30 percent removal on a monthly 
average basis because of circumstances beyond the applicant's control. 
Circumstances beyond the applicant's control may include seasonally 
dilute influent BOD concentrations due to relatively high (although 
nonexcessive) inflow and infiltration; relatively high soluble to 
insoluble BOD ratios on a fluctuating basis; or cold climates resulting 
in cold influent. Circumstances beyond the applicant's control shall not 
include less concentrated wastewater due to excessive inflow and 
infiltration (I&I). The determination of whether the less concentrated 
wastewater is the result of excessive I&I will be based on the 
definition of excessive I&I in 40 CFR 35.2005(b)(16) plus the additional 
criterion that inflow is nonexcessive if the total flow to the POTW 
(i.e., wastewater plus inflow plus infiltration) is less than 275 
gallons per capita per day.
    (3) In no event shall averaging on a less frequent basis than 
annually be allowed.


<R05>
Sec. 125.61  Existence of and compliance with applicable water quality standards.

    (a) There must exist a water quality standard or standards 
applicable to the pollutant(s) for which a section 301(h) modified 
permit is requested, including:
    (1) Water quality standards for biochemical oxygen demand or 
dissolved oxygen;
    (2) Water quality standards for suspended solids, turbidity, light 
transmission, light scattering, or maintenance of the euphotic zone; and
    (3) Water quality standards for pH.
    (b) The applicant must: (1) Demonstrate that the modified discharge 
will comply with the above water quality standard(s); and
    (2) Provide a determination signed by the State or interstate 
agency(s) authorized to provide certification under Secs. 124.53 and 
124.54 that the proposed modified discharge will comply with applicable 
provisions of State law including water quality standards. This 
determination shall include a discussion of the basis for the conclusion 
reached.


<R05>
Sec. 125.62  Attainment or maintenance of water quality which assures protection of public water supplies; assures the protection and propagation of a balanced 
          indigenous population of shellfish, fish, and wildlife; and 
          allows recreational activities.

    (a) Physical characteristics of discharge. (1) At the time the 
301(h) modification becomes effective, the applicant's outfall and 
diffuser must be located and designed to provide adequate initial 
dilution, dispersion, and transport of wastewater such that the 
discharge does not exceed at and beyond the zone of initial dilution:
    (i) All applicable water quality standards; and
    (ii) All applicable EPA water quality criteria for pollutants for 
which there is no applicable EPA-approved water

[[Page 559]]

quality standard that directly corresponds to the EPA water quality 
criterion for the pollutant.
    (iii) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, a State 
water quality standard ``directly corresponds'' to an EPA water quality 
criterion only if:
    (A) The State water quality standard addresses the same pollutant as 
the EPA water quality criterion and
    (B) The State water quality standard specifies a numeric criterion 
for that pollutant or State objective methodology for deriving such a 
numeric criterion.
    (iv) The evaluation of compliance with paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and 
(ii) of this section shall be based upon conditions reflecting periods 
of maximum stratification and during other periods when discharge 
characteristics, water quality, biological seasons, or oceanographic 
conditions indicate more critical situations may exist.
    (2) The evaluation under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section as to 
compliance with applicable section 304(a)(1) water quality criteria 
shall be based on the following:
    (i) For aquatic life criteria: The pollutant concentrations that 
must not be exceeded are the numeric ambient values, if any, specified 
in the EPA section 304(a)(1) water quality criteria documents as the 
concentrations at which acute and chronic toxicity to aquatic life 
occurs or that are otherwise identified as the criteria to protect 
aquatic life.
    (ii) For human health criteria for carcinogens: (A) For a known or 
suspected carcinogen, the Administrator shall determine the pollutant 
concentration that shall not be exceeded. To make this determination, 
the Administrator shall first determine a level of risk associated with 
the pollutant that is acceptable for purposes of this section. The 
Administrator shall then use the information in the section 304(a)(1) 
water quality criterion document, supplemented by all other relevant 
information, to determine the specific pollutant concentration that 
corresponds to the identified risk level.
    (B) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, an 
acceptable risk level will be a single level that has been consistently 
used, as determined by the Administrator, as the basis of the State's 
EPA-approved water quality standards for carcinogenic pollutants. 
Alternatively, the Administrator may consider a State's recommendation 
to use a risk level that has been otherwise adopted or formally proposed 
by the State. The State recommendation must demonstrate, to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator, that the recommended level is 
sufficiently protective of human health in light of the exposure and 
uncertainty factors associated with the estimate of the actual risk 
posed by the applicant's discharge. The State must include with its 
demonstration a showing that the risk level selected is based on the 
best information available and that the State has held a public hearing 
to review the selection of the risk level, in accordance with provisions 
of State law and public participation requirements of 40 CFR part 25. If 
the Administrator neither determines that there is a consistently used 
single risk level nor accepts a risk level recommended by the State, 
then the Administrator shall otherwise determine an acceptable risk 
level based on all relevant information.
    (iii) For human health criteria for noncarcinogens: For 
noncarcinogenic pollutants, the pollutant concentrations that must not 
be exceeded are the numeric ambient values, if any, specified in the EPA 
section 304(a)(1) water quality criteria documents as protective against 
the potential toxicity of the contaminant through ingestion of 
contaminated aquatic organisms.
    (3) The requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section 
apply in addition to, and do not waive or substitute for, the 
requirements of Sec. 125.61.
    (b) Impact of discharge on public water supplies. (1) The 
applicant's modified discharge must allow for the attainment or 
maintenance of water quality which assures protection of public water 
supplies.
    (2) The applicant's modified discharge must not:
    (i) Prevent a planned or existing public water supply from being 
used, or from continuing to be used, as a public water supply; or

[[Page 560]]

    (ii) Have the effect of requiring treatment over and above that 
which would be necessary in the absence of such discharge in order to 
comply with local and EPA drinking water standards.
    (c) Biological impact of discharge. (1) The applicant's modified 
discharge must allow for the attainment or maintenance of water quality 
which assures protection and propagation of a balanced indigenous 
population of shellfish, fish, and wildlife.
    (2) A balanced indigenous population of shellfish, fish, and 
wildlife must exist:
    (i) Immediately beyond the zone of initial dilution of the 
applicant's modified discharge; and
    (ii) In all other areas beyond the zone of initial dilution where 
marine life is actually or potentially affected by the applicant's 
modified discharge.
    (3) Conditions within the zone of initial dilution must not 
contribute to extreme adverse biological impacts, including, but not 
limited to, the destruction of distinctive habitats of limited 
distribution, the presence of disease epicenter, or the stimulation of 
phytoplankton blooms which have adverse effects beyond the zone of 
initial dilution.
    (4) In addition, for modified discharges into saline estuarine 
water:
    (i) Benthic populations within the zone of initial dilution must not 
differ substantially from the balanced indigenous populations which 
exist immediately beyond the boundary of the zone of initial dilution;
    (ii) The discharge must not interfere with estuarine migratory 
pathways within the zone of initial dilution; and
    (iii) The discharge must not result in the accumulation of toxic 
pollutants or pesticides at levels which exert adverse effects on the 
biota within the zone of initial dilution.
    (d) Impact of discharge on recreational activities. (1) The 
applicant's modified discharge must allow for the attainment or 
maintenance of water quality which allows for recreational activities 
beyond the zone of initial dilution, including, without limitation, 
swimming, diving, boating, fishing, and picnicking, and sports 
activities along shorelines and beaches.
    (2) There must be no Federal, State, or local restrictions on 
recreational activities within the vicinity of the applicant's modified 
outfall unless such restrictions are routinely imposed around sewage 
outfalls. This exception shall not apply where the restriction would be 
lifted or modified, in whole or in part, if the applicant were 
discharging a secondary treatment effluent.
    (e) Additional requirements for applications based on improved or 
altered discharges. An application for a section 301(h) modified permit 
on the basis of an improved or altered discharge must include:
    (1) A demonstration that such improvements or alterations have been 
thoroughly planned and studied and can be completed or implemented 
expeditiously;
    (2) Detailed analyses projecting changes in average and maximum 
monthly flow rates and composition of the applicant's discharge which 
are expected to result from proposed improvements or alterations;
    (3) The assessments required by paragraphs (a) through (d) of this 
section based on its current discharge; and
    (4) A detailed analysis of how the applicant's planned improvements 
or alterations will comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) 
through (d) of this section.
    (f) Stressed waters. An applicant must demonstrate compliance with 
paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section not only on the basis of the 
applicant's own modified discharge, but also taking into account the 
applicant's modified discharge in combination with pollutants from other 
sources. However, if an applicant which discharges into ocean waters 
believes that its failure to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) 
through (e) of this section is entirely attributable to conditions 
resulting from human perturbations other than its modified discharge 
(including, without limitation, other municipal or industrial 
discharges, nonpoint source runoff, and the applicant's previous 
discharges), the applicant need not demonstrate compliance with those 
requirements if it demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator, that its modified discharge does not or will not:

[[Page 561]]

    (1) Contribute to, increase, or perpetuate such stressed conditions;
    (2) Contribute to further degradation of the biota or water quality 
if the level of human perturbation from other sources increases; and
    (3) Retard the recovery of the biota or water quality if the level 
of human perturbation from other sources decreases.


<R05>
Sec. 125.63  Establishment of a monitoring program.

    (a) General requirements. (1) The applicant must:
    (i) Have a monitoring program that is:
    (A) Designed to provide data to evaluate the impact of the modified 
discharge on the marine biota, demonstrate compliance with applicable 
water quality standards or water quality criteria, as applicable, and 
measure toxic substances in the discharge, and
    (B) Limited to include only those scientific investigations 
necessary to study the effects of the proposed discharge;
    (ii) Describe the sampling techniques, schedules and locations 
(including appropriate control sites), analytical techniques, quality 
control and verification procedures to be used in the monitoring 
program;
    (iii) Demonstrate that it has the resources necessary to implement 
the program upon issuance of the modified permit and to carry it out for 
the life of the modified permit; and
    (iv) Determine the frequency and extent of the monitoring program 
taking into consideration the applicant's rate of discharge, quantities 
of toxic pollutants discharged, and potentially significant impacts on 
receiving water quality, marine biota, and designated water uses.
    (2) The Administrator may require revision of the proposed 
monitoring program before issuing a modified permit and during the term 
of any modified permit.
    (b) Biological monitoring program. The biological monitoring program 
for both small and large applicants shall provide data adequate to 
evaluate the impact of the modified discharge on the marine biota.
    (1) Biological monitoring shall include to the extent practicable:
    (i) Periodic surveys of the biological communities and populations 
which are most likely affected by the discharge to enable comparisons 
with baseline conditions described in the application and verified by 
sampling at the control stations/reference sites during the periodic 
surveys;
    (ii) Periodic determinations of the accumulation of toxic pollutants 
and pesticides in organisms and examination of adverse effects, such as 
disease, growth abnormalities, physiological stress, or death;
    (iii) Sampling of sediments in areas of solids deposition in the 
vicinity of the ZID, in other areas of expected impact, and at 
appropriate reference sites to support the water quality and biological 
surveys and to measure the accumulation of toxic pollutants and 
pesticides; and
    (iv) Where the discharge would affect commercial or recreational 
fisheries, periodic assessments of the conditions and productivity of 
fisheries.
    (2) Small applicants are not subject to the requirements of 
paragraph (b)(1) (ii) through (iv) of this section if they discharge at 
depths greater than 10 meters and can demonstrate through a suspended 
solids deposition analysis that there will be negligible seabed 
accumulation in the vicinity of the modified discharge.
    (3) For applicants seeking a section 301(h) modified permit based 
on:
    (i) A current discharge, biological monitoring shall be designed to 
demonstrate ongoing compliance with the requirements of Sec. 125.62(c);
    (ii) An improved discharge or altered discharge other than outfall 
relocation, biological monitoring shall provide baseline data on the 
current impact of the discharge and data which demonstrate, upon 
completion of improvements or alterations, that the requirements of 
Sec. 125.62(c) are met; or
    (iii) An improved or altered discharge involving outfall relocation, 
the biological monitoring shall:
    (A) Include the current discharge site until such discharge ceases; 
and
    (B) Provide baseline data at the relocation site to demonstrate the 
impact of the discharge and to provide the

[[Page 562]]

basis for demonstrating that requirements of Sec. 125.62(c) will be met.
    (c) Water quality monitoring program. The water quality monitoring 
program shall to the extent practicable:
    (1) Provide adequate data for evaluating compliance with water 
quality standards or water quality criteria, as applicable under 
Sec. 125.62(a)(1);
    (2) Measure the presence of toxic pollutants which have been 
identified or reasonably may be expected to be present in the discharge.
    (d) Effluent monitoring program. (1) In addition to the requirements 
of 40 CFR part 122, to the extent practicable, monitoring of the POTW 
effluent shall provide quantitative and qualitative data which measure 
toxic substances and pesticides in the effluent and the effectiveness of 
the toxic control program.
    (2) The permit shall require the collection of data on a frequency 
specified in the permit to provide adequate data for evaluating 
compliance with the percent removal efficiency requirements under 
Sec. 125.60.


<R05>
Sec. 125.64  Effect of the discharge on other point and nonpoint sources.

    (a) No modified discharge may result in any additional pollution 
control requirements on any other point or nonpoint source.
    (b) The applicant shall obtain a determination from the State or 
interstate agency(s) having authority to establish wasteload allocations 
indicating whether the applicant's discharge will result in an 
additional treatment pollution control, or other requirement on any 
other point or nonpoint sources. The State determination shall include a 
discussion of the basis for its conclusion.


<R05>
Sec. 125.65  Urban area pretreatment program.

    (a) Scope and applicability. (1) The requirements of this section 
apply to each POTW serving a population of 50,000 or more that has one 
or more toxic pollutants introduced into the POTW by one or more 
industrial dischargers and that seeks a section 301(h) modification.
    (2) The requirements of this section apply in addition to any 
applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 403, and do not waive or 
substitute for the part 403 requirements in any way.
    (b) Toxic pollutant control. (1) As to each toxic pollutant 
introduced by an industrial discharger, each POTW subject to the 
requirements of this section shall demonstrate that it either:
    (i) Has an applicable pretreatment requirement in effect in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section; or
    (ii) Has in effect a program that achieves secondary removal 
equivalency in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) Each applicant shall demonstrate that industrial sources 
introducing waste into the applicant's treatment works are in compliance 
with all applicable pretreatment requirements, including numerical 
standards set by local limits, and that it will enforce those 
requirements.
    (c) Applicable pretreatment requirement. (1) An applicable 
pretreatment requirement under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section with 
respect to a toxic pollutant shall consist of the following:
    (i) As to a toxic pollutant introduced into the applicant's 
treatment works by an industrial discharger for which there is no 
applicable categorical pretreatment standard for the toxic pollutant, a 
local limit or limits on the toxic pollutant as necessary to satisfy the 
requirements of 40 CFR part 403; and
    (ii) As to a toxic pollutant introduced into the applicant's 
treatment works by an industrial discharger that is subject to a 
categorical pretreatment standard for the toxic pollutant, the 
categorical standard and a local limit or limits as necessary to satisfy 
the requirements of 40 CFR part 403;
    (iii) As to a toxic pollutant introduced into the applicant's 
treatment works by an industrial discharger for which there is no 
applicable categorical pretreatment standard for the toxic pollutant, 
and the 40 CFR part 403 analysis on the toxic pollutant shows that no 
local limit is necessary, the applicant shall demonstrate to EPA on an 
annual basis during the term of the permit through continued monitoring 
and appropriate technical review that a local limit is not necessary, 
and, where

[[Page 563]]

appropriate, require industrial management practices plans and other 
pollution prevention activities to reduce or control the discharge of 
each such pollutant by industrial dischargers to the POTW. If such 
monitoring and technical review of data indicate that a local limit is 
needed, the POTW shall establish and implement a local limit.
    (2) Any local limits developed to meet the requirements of 
paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (c)(1) of this section shall be:
    (i) Consistent with all applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 403 
and
    (ii) Subject to approval by the Administrator as part of the 301(h) 
application review. The Administrator may require such local limits to 
be revised as necessary to meet the requirements of this section or 40 
CFR part 403.
    (d) Secondary removal equivalency. An applicant shall demonstrate 
that it achieves secondary removal equivalency through the use of a 
secondary treatment pilot (demonstration) plant at the applicant's 
facility which provides an empirical determination of the amount of a 
toxic pollutant removed by the application of secondary treatment to the 
applicant's influent where the applicant's influent has not been 
pretreated. Alternatively, an applicant may make this determination 
using influent that has received industrial pretreatment, 
notwithstanding the definition of secondary removal equivalency in 
Sec. 125.58(w). The NPDES permit shall include effluent limits based on 
the data from the secondary equivalency demonstration when those limits 
are more stringent than effluent limits based on State water quality 
standards or water quality criteria, if applicable, or are otherwise 
required to assure that all applicable environmental protection criteria 
are met. Once such effluent limits are established in the NPDES permit, 
the POTW may either establish local limits or perform additional 
treatment at the POTW or a combination of the two to achieve the permit 
limit.


<R05>
Sec. 125.66  Toxics control program.

    (a) Chemical analysis. (1) The applicant shall submit at the time of 
application a chemical analysis of its current discharge for all toxic 
pollutants and pesticides as defined in Sec. 125.58(aa) and (p). The 
analysis shall be performed on two 24-hour composite samples (one dry 
weather and one wet weather). Applicants may supplement or substitute 
chemical analyses if composition of the supplemental or substitute 
samples typifies that which occurs during dry and wet weather 
conditions.
    (2) Unless required by the State, this requirement shall not apply 
to any small section 301(h) applicant which certifies that there are no 
known or suspected sources of toxic pollutants or pesticides and 
documents the certification with an industrial user survey as described 
by 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2).
    (b) Identification of sources. The applicant shall submit at the 
time of application an analysis of the known or suspected sources of 
toxic pollutants or pesticides identified in Sec. 125.66(a). The 
applicant shall to the extent practicable categorize the sources 
according to industrial and nonindustrial types.
    (c) Industrial pretreatment requirements. (1) An applicant that has 
known or suspected industrial sources of toxic pollutants shall have an 
approved pretreatment program in accordance with 40 CFR part 403.
    (2) This requirement shall not apply to any applicant which has no 
known or suspected industrial sources of toxic pollutants or pesticides 
and so certifies to the Administrator.
    (3) The pretreatment program submitted by the applicant under this 
section shall be subject to revision as required by the Administrator 
prior to issuing or renewing any section 301(h) modified permit and 
during the term of any such permit.
    (4) Implementation of all existing pretreatment requirements and 
authorities must be maintained through the period of development of any 
additional pretreatment requirements that may be necessary to comply 
with the requirements of this subpart.
    (d) Nonindustrial source control program. (1) The applicant shall 
submit a proposed public education program designed to minimize the 
entrance of nonindustrial toxic pollutants and pesticides into its 
POTW(s) which shall be implemented no later than 18 months

[[Page 564]]

after issuance of a 301(h) modified permit.
    (2) The applicant shall also develop and implement additional 
nonindustrial source control programs on the earliest possible schedule.

                             I. Introduction

    1. This questionnaire is to be submitted by both small and large 
applicants for modification of secondary treatment requirements under 
section 301(h) of the Clean Water Act (CWA). A small applicant is 
defined as a POTW that has a contributing population to its wastewater 
treatment facility of less than 50,000 and a projected average dry 
weather flow of less than 5.0 million gallons per day (mgd, 0.22 cubic 
meters/sec) [40 CFR 125.58(c)]. A large applicant is defined as a POTW 
that has a population contributing to its wastewater treatment facility 
of at least 50,000 or a projected average dry weather flow of its 
discharge of at least 5.0 million gallons per day (mgd, 0.22 cubic 
meters/sec) [40 CFR 125.58(c)]. The questionnaire is in two sections, a 
general information and basic requirements section (part II) and a 
technical evaluation section (part III). Satisfactory completion by 
small and large dischargers of the appropriate questions of this 
questionnaire is necessary to enable EPA to determine whether the 
applicant's modified discharge meets the criteria of section 301(h) and 
EPA regulations (40 CFR part 125, subpart G).
    2. Most small applicants should be able to complete the 
questionnaire using available information. However, small POTWs with low 
initial dilution discharging into shallow waters or waters with poor 
dispersion and transport characteristics, discharging near distinctive 
and susceptible biological habitats, or discharging substantial 
quantities of toxics should anticipate the need to collect additional 
information and/or conduct additional analyses to demonstrate compliance 
with section 301(h) criteria. If there are questions in this regard, 
applicants should contact the appropriate EPA Regional Office for 
guidance.
    3. Guidance for responding to this questionnaire is provided by the 
newly amended section 301(h) technical support document. Where available 
information is incomplete and the applicant needs to collect additional 
data during the period it is preparing the application or a letter of 
intent, EPA encourages the applicant to consult with EPA prior to data 
collection and submission. Such consultation, particularly if the 
applicant provides a project plan, will help ensure that the proper data 
are gathered in the most efficient matter.
    4. The notation (L) means large applicants must respond to the 
question, and (S) means small applicants must respond.

  Subpart H--Criteria for Determining Alternative Effluent Limitations 
                     Under Section 316(a) of the Act


<R05>
Sec. 125.70  Purpose and scope.

    Section 316(a) of the Act provides that:

    ``With respect to any point source otherwise subject to the 
provisions of section 301 or section 306 of this Act, whenever the owner 
or operator of any such source, after opportunity for public hearing, 
can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator (or, if 
appropriate, the State) that any effluent limitation proposed for the 
control of the thermal component of any discharge from such source will 
require effluent limitations more stringent than necessary to assure the 
projection [sic] and propagation of a balanced, indigenous population of 
shellfish, fish and wildlife in and on the body of water into which the 
discharge is to be made, the Administrator (or, if appropriate, the 
State) may impose an effluent limitation under such sections on such 
plant, with respect to the thermal component of such discharge (taking 
into account the interaction of such thermal component with other 
pollutants), that will assure the protection and propagation of a 
balanced indigenous population of shellfish, fish and wildlife in and on 
that body of water.''

This subpart describes the factors, criteria and standards for the 
establishment of alternative thermal effluent limitations under section 
316(a) of the Act in permits issued under section 402(a) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 125.71  Definitions.

    For the purpose of this subpart:
    (a) Alternative effluent limitations means all effluent limitations 
or standards of performance for the control of the thermal component of 
any discharge which are established under section 316(a) and this 
subpart.
    (b) Representative important species means species which are 
representative, in terms of their biological needs, of a balanced, 
indigenous community of shellfish, fish and wildlife in the body of 
water into which a discharge of heat is made.
    (c) The term balanced, indigenous community is synonymous with the 
term balanced, indigenous population in the Act and means a biotic 
community typically characterized by diversity, the capacity to sustain 
itself through cyclic seasonal changes, presence of necessary food chain 
species and by a lack of domination by pollution tolerant species. Such 
a community may include historically non-native species introduced in 
connection with a program of wildlife management and species whose 
presence or abundance results from substantial, irreversible 
environmental modifications. Normally, however, such a community will 
not include species whose presence or abundance is attributable to the 
introduction of pollutants that will be eliminated by compliance by all 
sources with section 301(b)(2) of the Act; and may not include species 
whose presence or abundance is attributable to alternative effluent 
limitations imposed pursuant to section 316(a).


<R05>
Sec. 125.72  Early screening of applications for section 316(a) variances.

    (a) Any initial application for a section 316(a) variance shall 
include the following early screening information:
    (1) A description of the alternative effluent limitation requested;
    (2) A general description of the method by which the discharger 
proposes to demonstrate that the otherwise applicable thermal discharge 
effluent limitations are more stringent than necessary;
    (3) A general description of the type of data, studies, experiments 
and other

[[Page 571]]

information which the discharger intends to submit for the 
demonstration; and
    (4) Such data and information as may be available to assist the 
Director in selecting the appropriate representative important species.
    (b) After submitting the early screening information under paragraph 
(a) of this section, the discharger shall consult with the Director at 
the earliest practicable time (but not later than 30 days after the 
application is filed) to discuss the discharger's early screening 
information. Within 60 days after the application is filed, the 
discharger shall submit for the Director's approval a detailed plan of 
study which the discharger will undertake to support its section 316(a) 
demonstration. The discharger shall specify the nature and extent of the 
following type of information to be included in the plan of study: 
Biological, hydrographical and meteorological data; physical monitoring 
data; engineering or diffusion models; laboratory studies; 
representative important species; and other relevant information. In 
selecting representative important species, special consideration shall 
be given to species mentioned in applicable water quality standards. 
After the discharger submits its detailed plan of study, the Director 
shall either approve the plan or specify any necessary revisions to the 
plan. The discharger shall provide any additional information or studies 
which the Director subsequently determines necessary to support the 
demonstration, including such studies or inspections as may be necessary 
to select representative important species. The discharger may provide 
any additional information or studies which the discharger feels are 
appropriate to support the demonstration.
    (c) Any application for the renewal of a section 316(a) variance 
shall include only such information described in paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section and Sec. 124.73(c)(1) as the Director requests within 60 
days after receipt of the permit application.
    (d) The Director shall promptly notify the Secretary of Commerce and 
the Secretary of the Interior, and any affected State of the filing of 
the request and shall consider any timely recommendations they submit.
    (e) In making the demonstration the discharger shall consider any 
information or guidance published by EPA to assist in making such 
demonstrations.
    (f) If an applicant desires a ruling on a section 316(a) application 
before the ruling on any other necessary permit terms and conditions, 
(as provided by Sec. 124.65), it shall so request upon filing its 
application under paragraph (a) of this section. This request shall be 
granted or denied at the discretion of the Director.

    Note: At the expiration of the permit, any discharger holding a 
section 316(a) variance should be prepared to support the continuation 
of the variance with studies based on the discharger's actual operation 
experience.

<R05>
Sec. 125.73  Criteria and standards for the determination of alternative effluent limitations under section 316(a).

    (a) Thermal discharge effluent limitations or standards established 
in permits may be less stringent than those required by applicable 
standards and limitations if the discharger demonstrates to the 
satisfaction of the director that such effluent limitations are more 
stringent than necessary to assure the protection and propagation of a 
balanced, indigenous community of shellfish, fish and wildlife in and on 
the body of water into which the discharge is made. This demonstration 
must show that the alternative effluent limitation desired by the 
discharger, considering the cumulative impact of its thermal discharge 
together with all other significant impacts on the species affected, 
will assure the protection and propagation of a balanced indigenous 
community of shellfish, fish and wildlife in and on the body of water 
into which the discharge is to be made.
    (b) In determining whether or not the protection and propagation of 
the affected species will be assured, the Director may consider any 
information contained or referenced in any applicable thermal water 
quality criteria and thermal water quality information published by the 
Administrator under

[[Page 572]]

section 304(a) of the Act, or any other information he deems relevant.
    (c) (1) Existing dischargers may base their demonstration upon the 
absence of prior appreciable harm in lieu of predictive studies. Any 
such demonstrations shall show:
    (i) That no appreciable harm has resulted from the normal component 
of the discharge (taking into account the interaction of such thermal 
component with other pollutants and the additive effect of other thermal 
sources to a balanced, indigenous community of shellfish, fish and 
wildlife in and on the body of water into which the discharge has been 
made; or
    (ii) That despite the occurrence of such previous harm, the desired 
alternative effluent limitations (or appropriate modifications thereof) 
will nevertheless assure the protection and propagation of a balanced, 
indigenous community of shellfish, fish and wildlife in and on the body 
of water into which the discharge is made.
    (2) In determining whether or not prior appreciable harm has 
occurred, the Director shall consider the length of time in which the 
applicant has been discharging and the nature of the discharge.

    Subpart K--Criteria and Standards for Best Management Practices 
               Authorized Under Section 304(e) of the Act


<R05>
Sec. 125.100  Purpose and scope.

    This subpart describes how best management practices (BMPs) for 
ancillary industrial activities under section 304(e) of the Act shall be 
reflected in permits, including best management practices promulgated in 
effluent limitations under section 304 and established on a case-by-case 
basis in permits under section 402(a)(1) of the Act. Best management 
practices authorized by section 304(e) are included in permits as 
requirements for the purposes of section 301, 302, 306, 307, or 403 of 
the Act, as the case may be.


<R05>
Sec. 125.101  Definition.

    Manufacture means to produce as an intermediate or final product, or 
by-product.



<R05>
Sec. 125.102  Applicability of best management practices.

    Dischargers who use, manufacture, store, handle or discharge any 
pollutant listed as toxic under section 307(a)(1) of the Act or any 
pollutant listed as hazardous under section 311 of the Act are subject 
to the requirements of this Subpart for all activities which may result 
in significant amounts of those pollutants reaching waters of the United 
States. These activities are ancillary manufacturing operations 
including: Materials storage areas; in-plant transfer, process and 
material handling areas; loading and unloading operations; plant site 
runoff; and sludge and waste disposal areas.



<R05>
Sec. 125.103  Permit terms and conditions.

    (a) Best management practices shall be expressly incorporated into a 
permit where required by an applicable EPA promulgated effluent 
limitations guideline under section 304(e);
    (b) Best management practices may be expressly incorporated into a 
permit on a case-by-case basis where determined necessary to carry out 
the provisions of the Act under section 402(a)(1). In issuing a permit 
containing BMP requirements, the Director shall consider the following 
factors:
    (1) Toxicity of the pollutant(s);
    (2) Quantity of the pollutant(s) used, produced, or discharged;
    (3) History of NPDES permit violations;
    (4) History of significant leaks or spills of toxic or hazardous 
pollutants;
    (5) Potential for adverse impact on public health (e.g., proximity 
to a public water supply) or the environment (e.g., proximity to a sport 
or commerical fishery); and
    (6) Any other factors determined to be relevant to the control of 
toxic or hazardous pollutants.

[[Page 573]]

    (c) Best management practices may be established in permits under 
paragraph (b) of this section alone or in combination with those 
required under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, dischargers covered under Sec. 125.102 shall develop and 
implement a best management practices program in accordance with 
Sec. 125.104 which prevents, or minimizes the potential for, the release 
of toxic or hazardous pollutants from ancillary activities to waters of 
the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 125.104  Best management practices programs.

    (a) BMP programs shall be developed in accordance with good 
engineering practices and with the provisions of this subpart.
    (b) The BMP program shall:
    (1) Be documented in narrative form, and shall include any necessary 
plot plans, drawings or maps;
    (2) Establish specific objectives for the control of toxic and 
hazardous pollutants.
    (i) Each facility component or system shall be examined for its 
potential for causing a release of significant amounts of toxic or 
hazardous pollutants to waters of the United States due to equipment 
failure, improper operation, natural phenomena such as rain or snowfall, 
etc.
    (ii) Where experience indicates a reasonable potential for equipment 
failure (e.g., a tank overflow or leakage), natural condition (e.g., 
precipitation), or other circumstances to result in significant amounts 
of toxic or hazardous pollutants reaching surface waters, the program 
should include a prediction of the direction, rate of flow and total 
quantity of toxic or hazardous pollutants which could be discharged from 
the facility as a result of each condition or circumstance;
    (3) Establish specific best management practices to meet the 
objectives identified under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, addressing 
each component or system capable of causing a release of significant 
amounts of toxic or hazardous pollutants to the waters of the United 
States;
    (4) The BMP program: (i) May reflect requirements for Spill 
Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) plans under section 311 of 
the Act and 40 CFR part 151, and may incorporate any part of such plans 
into the BMP program by reference;

[Comment: EPA has proposed section 311(j)(1)(c) regulations (43 FR 
39276) which require facilities subject to NPDES to develop and 
implement SPCC plans to prevent discharges of reportable quantities of 
designated hazardous substances. While subpart K requires only 
procedural activities and minor construction, the proposed 40 CFR part 
151 (SPCC regulations) are more stringent and comprehensive with respect 
to their requirements for spill prevention. In developing BMP programs 
in accordance with subpart K, owners or operators should also consider 
the requirements of proposed 40 CFR part 151 which may address many of 
the same areas of the facility covered by this subpart.]

    (ii) Shall assure the proper management of solid and hazardous waste 
in accordance with regulations promulgated under the Solid Waste 
Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 
of 1976 (RCRA) (40 U.S.C. 6901 et seq). Management practices required 
under RCRA regulations shall be expressly incorporated into the BMP 
program; and
    (iii) Shall address the following points for the ancillary 
activities in Sec. 125.102:
    (A) Statement of policy;
    (B) Spill Control Committee;
    (C) Material inventory;
    (D) Material compatibility;
    (E) Employee training:
    (F) Reporting and notification procedures;
    (G) Visual inspections;
    (H) Preventive maintenance;
    (I) Housekeeping; and
    (J) Security.

    [Comment: Additional technical information on BMPs and the elements 
of a BMP program is contained in publication entitled ``Guidance Manual 
for Developing Best Management Practices (BMP).'' Copies may be obtained 
by written request to the Office of Water Resource Center (mail code: 
4100), Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC 20460].

    (c)(1) The BMP program must be clearly described and submitted as 
part

[[Page 574]]

of the permit application. An application which does not contain a BMP 
program shall be considered incomplete. Upon receipt of the application, 
the Director shall approve or modify the program in accordance with the 
requirements of this subpart. The BMP program as approved or modified 
shall be included in the draft permit (Sec. 124.6). The BMP program 
shall be subject to the applicable permit issuance requirements of part 
124, resulting in the incorporation of the program (including any 
modifications of the program resulting from the permit issuance 
procedures) into the final permit.
    (2) Proposed modifications to the BMP program which affect the 
discharger's permit obligations shall be submitted to the Director for 
approval. If the Director approves the proposed BMP program 
modification, the permit shall be modified in accordance with 
Sec. 122.62, provided that the Director may waive the requirements for 
public notice and opportunity for hearing on such modification if he or 
she determines that the modification is not significant. The BMP 
program, or modification thereof, shall be fully implemented as soon as 
possible but not later than one year after permit issuance, 
modification, or revocation and reissuance unless the Director specifies 
a later date in the permit.

    Note: A later date may be specified in the permit, for example, to 
enable coordinated preparation of the BMP program required under these 
regulations and the SPCC plan required under 40 CFR part 151 or to allow 
for the completion of construction projects related to the facility's 
BMP or SPCC program.
    (d) The discharger shall maintain a description of the BMP program 
at the facility and shall make the description available to the Director 
upon request.
    (e) The owner or operator of a facility subject to this subpart 
shall amend the BMP program in accordance with the provisions of this 
subpart whenever there is a change in facility design, construction, 
operation, or maintenance which materially affects the facility's 
potential for discharge of significant amounts of hazardous or toxic 
pollutants into the waters of the United States.
    (f) If the BMP program proves to be ineffective in achieving the 
general objective of preventing the release of significant amounts of 
toxic or hazardous pollutants to those waters and the specific 
objectives and requirements under paragraph (b) of this section, the 
permit and/or the BMP program shall be subject to modification to 
incorporate revised BMP requirements.

<R05>
Sec. 125.120  Scope and purpose.

    This subpart establishes guidelines for issuance of National 
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits for the discharge 
of pollutants from a point source into the territorial seas, the 
contiguous zone, and the oceans.



<R05>
Sec. 125.121  Definitions.

    (a) Irreparable harm means significant undesirable effects occurring 
after the date of permit issuance which will not be reversed after 
cessation or modification of the discharge.
    (b) Marine environment means that territorial seas, the contiguous 
zone and the oceans.
    (c) Mixing zone means the zone extending from the sea's surface to 
seabed and extending laterally to a distance of 100 meters in all 
directions from the discharge point(s) or to the boundary of the zone of 
initial dilution as calculated by a plume model approved by the 
director, whichever is greater, unless the director determines that the 
more restrictive mixing zone or another definition of the mixing

[[Page 575]]

zone is more appropriate for a specific discharge.
    (d) No reasonable alternatives means:
    (1) No land-based disposal sites, discharge point(s) within internal 
waters, or approved ocean dumping sites within a reasonable distance of 
the site of the proposed discharge the use of which would not cause 
unwarranted economic impacts on the discharger, or, notwithstanding the 
availability of such sites,
    (2) On-site disposal is environmentally preferable to other 
alternative means of disposal after consideration of:
    (i) The relative environmental harm of disposal on-site, in disposal 
sites located on land, from discharge point(s) within internal waters, 
or in approved ocean dumping sites, and
    (ii) The risk to the environment and human safety posed by the 
transportation of the pollutants.
    (e) Unreasonable degradation of the marine environment means: (1) 
Significant adverse changes in ecosystem diversity, productivity and 
stability of the biological community within the area of discharge and 
surrounding biological communities,
    (2) Threat to human health through direct exposure to pollutants or 
through consumption of exposed aquatic organisms, or
    (3) Loss of esthetic, recreational, scientific or economic values 
which is unreasonable in relation to the benefit derived from the 
discharge.



<R05>
Sec. 125.122  Determination of unreasonable degradation of the marine environment.

    (a) The director shall determine whether a discharge will cause 
unreasonable degradation of the marine environment based on 
consideration of:
    (1) The quantities, composition and potential for bioaccumulation or 
persistence of the pollutants to be discharged;
    (2) The potential transport of such pollutants by biological, 
physical or chemical processes;
    (3) The composition and vulnerability of the biological communities 
which may be exposed to such pollutants, including the presence of 
unique species or communities of species, the presence of species 
identified as endangered or threatened pursuant to the Endangered 
Species Act, or the presence of those species critical to the structure 
or function of the ecosystem, such as those important for the food 
chain;
    (4) The importance of the receiving water area to the surrounding 
biological community, including the presence of spawning sites, nursery/
forage areas, migratory pathways, or areas necessary for other functions 
or critical stages in the life cycle of an organism.
    (5) The existence of special aquatic sites including, but not 
limited to marine sanctuaries and refuges, parks, national and historic 
monuments, national seashores, wilderness areas and coral reefs;
    (6) The potential impacts on human health through direct and 
indirect pathways;
    (7) Existing or potential recreational and commercial fishing, 
including finfishing and shellfishing;
    (8) Any applicable requirements of an approved Coastal Zone 
Management plan;
    (9) Such other factors relating to the effects of the discharge as 
may be appropriate;
    (10) Marine water quality criteria developed pursuant to section 
304(a)(1).
    (b) Discharges in compliance with section 301(g), 301(h), or 316(a) 
variance requirements or State water quality standards shall be presumed 
not to cause unreasonable degradation of the marine environment, for any 
specific pollutants or conditions specified in the variance or the 
standard.


<R05>
Sec. 125.123  Permit requirements.

    (a) If the director on the basis of available information including 
that supplied by the applicant pursuant to Sec. 125.124 determines prior 
to permit issuance that the discharge will not cause unreasonable 
degradation of the marine environment after application of any necessary 
conditions specified in Sec. 125.123(d), he may issue an NPDES permit 
containing such conditions.
    (b) If the director, on the basis of available information including 
that supplied by the applicant pursuant to Sec. 125.124 determines prior 
to permit issuance that the discharge will cause unreasonable 
degradation of the marine environment after application of

[[Page 576]]

all possible permit conditions specified in Sec. 125.123(d), he may not 
issue an NPDES permit which authorizes the discharge of pollutants.
    (c) If the director has insufficient information to determine prior 
to permit issuance that there will be no unreasonable degradation of the 
marine environment pursuant to Sec. 125.122, there shall be no discharge 
of pollutants into the marine environment unless the director on the 
basis of available information, including that supplied by the applicant 
pursuant to Sec. 125.124 determines that:
    (1) Such discharge will not cause irreparable harm to the marine 
environment during the period in which monitoring is undertaken, and
    (2) There are no reasonable alternatives to the on-site disposal of 
these materials, and
    (3) The discharge will be in compliance with all permit conditions 
established pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) All permits which authorize the discharge of pollutants pursuant 
to paragraph (c) of this section shall:
    (1) Require that a discharge of pollutants will: (i) Following 
dilution as measured at the boundary of the mixing zone not exceed the 
limiting permissible concentration for the liquid and suspended 
particulate phases of the waste material as described in Sec. 227.27(a) 
(2) and (3), Sec. 227.27(b), and Sec. 227.27(c) of the Ocean Dumping 
Criteria; and (ii) not exceed the limiting permissible concentration for 
the solid phase of the waste material or cause an accumulation of toxic 
materials in the human food chain as described in Sec. 227.27 (b) and 
(d) of the Ocean Dumping Criteria;
    (2) Specify a monitoring program, which is sufficient to assess the 
impact of the discharge on water, sediment, and biological quality 
including, where appropriate, analysis of the bioaccumulative and/or 
persistent impact on aquatic life of the discharge;
    (3) Contain any other conditions, such as performance of liquid or 
suspended particulate phase bioaccumulation tests, seasonal restrictions 
on discharge, process modifications, dispersion of pollutants, or 
schedule of compliance for existing discharges, which are determined to 
be necessary because of local environmental conditions, and
    (4) Contain the following clause: In addition to any other grounds 
specified herein, this permit shall be modified or revoked at any time 
if, on the basis of any new data, the director determines that continued 
discharges may cause unreasonable degradation of the marine environment.



<R05>
Sec. 125.124  Information required to be submitted by applicant.

    The applicant is responsible for providing information which the 
director may request to make the determination required by this subpart. 
The director may require the following information as well as any other 
pertinent information:

would result in such a discharge shall first notify the Regional 
Administrator (or State Director, if appropriate) in the manner herein 
provided at least 60 days prior to any such discharge.
    (b) Upon receipt of any application for issuance or reissuance of a 
permit or for a modification of an existing permit for a discharge 
subject to a toxic pollutant effluent standard or prohibition the 
permitting authority shall proceed thereon in accordance with 40 CFR 
part 124 or 125, whichever is applicable.
    (c)(1) Every permit which contains limitations based upon a toxic 
pollutant effluent standard or prohibition under this part is subject to 
revision following the completion of any proceeding revising such toxic 
pollutant effluent standard or prohibition regardless of the duration 
specified on the permit.
    (2) For purposes of this section, all toxic pollutants for which 
standards are set under this part are deemed to be injurious to human 
health within the meaning of section 402(k) of the Act unless otherwise 
specified in the standard established for any particular pollutant.
    (d)(1) Upon the compliance date for any section 307(a) toxic 
pollutant effluent standard or prohibition, each owner or operator of a 
discharge subject to such standard or prohibition shall comply with such 
monitoring, sampling, recording, and reporting conditions as the

for that discharge. Notice of such conditions shall be provided in 
writing to the owner or operator.
    (2) In addition to any conditions required pursuant to paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section and to the extent not required in conditions 
contained in NPDES permits, within 60 days following the close of each 
calendar year each owner or operator of a discharge subject to any toxic 
standard or prohibition shall report to the Regional Administrator (or 
State Director, if appropriate) concerning the compliance of such 
discharges. Such report shall include, as a minimum, information 
concerning (i) relevant identification of the discharger such as name,

Sec. 129.6   Adjustment of effluent standard for presence of toxic pollutant in the intake water.

    (a) Upon the request of the owner or operator of a facility 
discharging a pollutant subject to a toxic pollutant effluent standard 
or prohibition, the Regional Administrator (or State Director, if 
appropriate) shall give credit, and shall adjust the effluent 
standard(s) in such permit to reflect credit for the toxic pollutant(s) 
in the owner's or operator's water supply if (1) the source of the 
owner's or operator's water supply is the same body of water into which 
the discharge is made and if (2) it is demonstrated to the Regional 
Administrator (or State Director, if appropriate) that the toxic 
pollutant(s) present in the owner's or operator's intake water will not 
be removed by any wastewater treatment systems whose design capacity and 
operation were such as to reduce toxic pollutants to the levels required 
by the applicable toxic pollutant effluent standards in the absence of 
the toxic pollutant in the intake water.
    (b) Effluent limitations established pursuant to this section shall 
be calculated on the basis of the amount of section 307(a) toxic 
pollutant(s) present in the water after any water supply treatment steps 
have been performed by or for the owner or operator.
    (c) Any permit which includes toxic pollutant effluent limitations 
established pursuant to this section shall also contain conditions 
requiring the permittee to conduct additional monitoring in the manner 
and locations determined by the Regional Administrator (or State 
Director, if appropriate) for those toxic pollutants for which the toxic 
pollutant effluent standards have been adjusted.


<R05>
Sec. 129.7   Requirement and procedure for establishing a more stringent effluent limitation.

    (a) In exceptional cases: (1) Where the Regional Administrator (or 
State Director, if appropriate) determines that the ambient water 
criterion established in these standards is not being met or will not be 
met in the receiving water as a result of one or more discharges at 
levels allowed by these standards, and
    (2) Where he further determines that this is resulting in or may 
cause or contribute to significant adverse effects on aquatic or other 
organisms usually or potentially present, or on human health, he may 
issue to an owner or operator a permit or a permit modification 
containing a toxic pollutant effluent limitation at a more stringent 
level than that required by the standard set forth in these regulations. 
Any such action shall be taken pursuant to the procedural provisions of 
40 CFR parts 124 and 125, as appropriate. In any proceeding in 
connection with such action the burden of proof and of going forward 
with evidence with regard to such more stringent effluent limitation 
shall be upon the Regional Administrator (or State Director, if 
appropriate) as the proponent of such more stringent effluent 
limitation.
    (3) Evidence in such proceeding shall include at a minimum: An 
analysis using data and other information to

[[Page 581]]

demonstrate receiving water concentrations of the specified toxic 
pollutant, projections of the anticipated effects of the proposed 
modification on such receiving water concentrations, and the hydrologic 
and hydrographic characteristics of the receiving waters including the 
occurrence of dispersion of the effluent. Detailed specifications for 
presenting relevant information by any interested party may be 
prescribed in guidance documents published from time to time, whose 
availability will be announced in the Federal Register.
    (b) Any effluent limitation in an NPDES permit which a State 
proposes to issue which is more stringent than the toxic pollutant 
effluent standards promulgated by the Administrator is subject to review 
by the Administrator under section 402(d) of the Act. The Administrator 
may approve or disapprove such limitation(s) or specify another 
limitation(s) upon review of any record of any proceedings held in 
connection with the permit issuance or modification and any other 
evidence available to him. If he takes no action within ninety days of 
his receipt of the notification of the action of the permit issuing 
authority and any record thereof, the action of the State permit issuing 
authority shall be deemed to be approved.


<R05>
Sec. 129.8   Compliance date.

    (a) The effluent standards or prohibitions set forth herein shall be 
complied with not later than one year after promulgation unless an 
earlier date is established by the Administrator for an industrial 
subcategory in the promulgation of the standards or prohibitions.
    (b) Toxic pollutant effluent standards or prohibitions set forth 
herein shall become enforceable under sections 307(d) and 309 of the Act 
on the date established in paragraph (a) of this section regardless of 
proceedings in connection with the issuance of any NPDES permit or 
application therefor, or modification or renewal thereof.

<R05>
Sec. 130.0  Program summary and purpose.

    (a) This subpart establishes policies and program requirements for 
water quality planning, management and implementation under sections 
106, 205(j), non-construction management 205(g), 208, 303 and 305 of the 
Clean Water Act. The Water Quality Management (WQM) process described in 
the Act and in this regulation provides the authority for a consistent 
national approach for maintaining, improving and protecting water 
quality while allowing States to implement the most effective individual 
programs. The process is implemented jointly by EPA, the States, 
interstate agencies, and areawide, local and regional planning 
organizations.

[[Page 588]]

This regulation explains the requirements of the Act, describes the 
relationships between the several components of the WQM process and 
outlines the roles of the major participants in the process. The 
components of the WQM process are discussed below.
    (b) Water quality standards (WQS) are the State's goals for 
individual water bodies and provide the legal basis for control 
decisions under the Act. Water quality monitoring activities provide the 
chemical, physical and biological data needed to determine the present 
quality of a State's waters and to identify the sources of pollutants in 
those waters. The primary assessment of the quality of a State's water 
is contained in its biennial Report to Congress required by section 
305(b) of the Act.
    (c) This report and other assessments of water quality are used in 
the State's WQM plans to identify priority water quality problems. These 
plans also contain the results of the State's analyses and management 
decisions which are necessary to control specific sources of pollution. 
The plans recommend control measures and designated management agencies 
(DMAs) to attain the goals established in the State's water quality 
standards.
    (d) These control measures are implemented by issuing permits, 
building publicly-owned treatment works (POTWs), instituting best 
management practices for nonpoint sources of pollution and other means. 
After control measures are in place, the State evaluates the extent of 
the resulting improvements in water quality, conducts additional data 
gathering and planning to determine needed modifications in control 
measures and again institutes control measures.
    (e) This process is a dynamic one, in which requirements and 
emphases vary over time. At present, States have completed WQM plans 
which are generally comprehensive in geographic and programmatic scope. 
Technology based controls are being implemented for most point sources 
of pollution. However, WQS have not been attained in many water bodies 
and are threatened in others.
    (f) Present continuing planning requirements serve to identify these 
critical water bodies, develop plans for achieving higher levels of 
abatement and specify additional control measures. Consequently, this 
regulation reflects a programmatic emphasis on concentrating planning 
and abatement activities on priority water quality issues and geographic 
areas. EPA will focus its grant funds on activities designed to address 
these priorities. Annual work programs negotiated between EPA and State 
and interstate agencies will reflect this emphasis.


<R05>
Sec. 130.1  Applicability.

    (a) This subpart applies to all State, eligible Indian Tribe, 
interstate, areawide and regional and local CWA water quality planning 
and management activities undertaken on or after February 11, 1985 
including all updates and continuing certifications for approved Water 
Quality Management (WQM) plans developed under sections 208 and 303 of 
the Act.
    (b) Planning and management activities undertaken prior to February 
11, 1985 are governed by the requirements of the regulations in effect 
at the time of the last grant award.

FR 13817, Mar. 23, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 130.2  Definitions.

    (a) The Act. The Clean Water Act, as amended, 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.
    (b) Indian Tribe. Any Indian Tribe, band, group, or community 
recognized by the Secretary of the Interior and exercising governmental 
authority over a Federal Indian reservation.
    (c) Pollution. The man-made or man-induced alteration of the 
chemical, physical, biological, and radiological integrity of water.
    (d) Water quality standards (WQS). Provisions of State or Federal 
law which consist of a designated use or uses for the waters of the 
United States and water quality criteria for such waters based upon such 
uses. Water quality standards are to protect the public health or 
welfare, enhance the quality of water and serve the purposes of the Act.

[[Page 589]]

    (e) Load or loading. An amount of matter or thermal energy that is 
introduced into a receiving water; to introduce matter or thermal energy 
into a receiving water. Loading may be either man-caused (pollutant 
loading) or natural (natural background loading).
    (f) Loading capacity. The greatest amount of loading that a water 
can receive without violating water quality standards.
    (g) Load allocation (LA). The portion of a receiving water's loading 
capacity that is attributed either to one of its existing or future 
nonpoint sources of pollution or to natural background sources. Load 
allocations are best estimates of the loading, which may range from 
reasonably accurate estimates to gross allotments, depending on the 
availability of data and appropriate techniques for predicting the 
loading. Wherever possible, natural and nonpoint source loads should be 
distinguished.
    (h) Wasteload allocation (WLA). The portion of a receiving water's 
loading capacity that is allocated to one of its existing or future 
point sources of pollution. WLAs constitute a type of water quality-
based effluent limitation.
    (i) Total maximum daily load (TMDL). The sum of the individual WLAs 
for point sources and LAs for nonpoint sources and natural background. 
If a receiving water has only one point source discharger, the TMDL is 
the sum of that point source WLA plus the LAs for any nonpoint sources 
of pollution and natural background sources, tributaries, or adjacent 
segments. TMDLs can be expressed in terms of either mass per time, 
toxicity, or other appropriate measure. If Best Management Practices 
(BMPs) or other nonpoint source pollution controls make more stringent 
load allocations practicable, then wasteload allocations can be made 
less stringent. Thus, the TMDL process provides for nonpoint source 
control tradeoffs.
    (j) Water quality limited segment. Any segment where it is known 
that water quality does not meet applicable water quality standards, 
and/or is not expected to meet applicable water quality standards, even 
after the application of the technology-based effluent limitations 
required by sections 301(b) and 306 of the Act.
    (k) Water quality management (WQM) plan. A State or areawide waste 
treatment management plan developed and updated in accordance with the 
provisions of sections 205(j), 208 and 303 of the Act and this 
regulation.
    (l) Areawide agency. An agency designated under section 208 of the 
Act, which has responsibilities for WQM planning within a specified area 
of a State.
    (m) Best Management Practice (BMP). Methods, measures or practices 
selected by an agency to meet its nonpoint source control needs. BMPs 
include but are not limited to structural and nonstructural controls and 
operation and maintenance procedures. BMPs can be applied before, during 
and after pollution-producing activities to reduce or eliminate the 
introduction of pollutants into receiving waters.
    (n) Designated management agency (DMA). An agency identified by a 
WQM plan and designated by the Governor to implement specific control 
recommendations.

<R05>
Sec. 130.3  Water quality standards.

    A water quality standard (WQS) defines the water quality goals of a 
water body, or portion thereof, by designating the use or uses to be 
made of the water and by setting criteria necessary to protect the uses. 
States and EPA adopt WQS to protect public health or welfare, enhance 
the quality of water and serve the purposes of the Clean Water Act 
(CWA). Serve the purposes of Act (as defined in sections 101(a)(2) and 
303(c) of the Act) means that WQS should, wherever attainable, provide 
water quality for the protection and propagation of fish, shellfish and 
wildlife and for recreation in and on the water and take into 
consideration their use and value for public water supplies, propagation 
of fish, shellfish, wildlife, recreation in and on the water, and 
agricultural, industrial and other purposes including navigation.

Such standards serve the dual purposes of establishing the water quality 
goals for a specific water body and serving as the regulatory basis for 
establishment

[[Page 590]]

of water quality-based treatment controls and strategies beyond the 
technology-based level of treatment required by sections 301(b) and 306 
of the Act. States shall review and revise WQS in accordance with 
applicable regulations and, as appropriate, update their Water Quality 
Management (WQM) plans to reflect such revisions. Specific WQS 
requirements are found in 40 CFR part 131.


<R05>
Sec. 130.4  Water quality monitoring.

    (a) In accordance with section 106(e)(1), States must establish 
appropriate monitoring methods and procedures (including biological 
monitoring) necessary to compile and analyze data on the quality of 
waters of the United States and, to the extent practicable, ground-
waters. This requirement need not be met by Indian Tribes. However, any 
monitoring and/or analysis activities undertaken by a Tribe must be 
performed in accordance with EPA's quality assurance/quality control 
guidance.
    (b) The State's water monitoring program shall include collection 
and analysis of physical, chemical and biological data and quality 
assurance and control programs to assure scientifically valid data. The 
uses of these data include determining abatement and control priorities; 
developing and reviewing water quality standards, total maximum daily 
loads, wasteload allocations and load allocations; assessing compliance 
with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits by 
dischargers; reporting information to the public through the section 
305(b) report and reviewing site-specific monitoring efforts.

<R05>
Sec. 130.5  Continuing planning process.

    (a) General. Each State shall establish and maintain a continuing 
planning process (CPP) as described under section 303(e)(3)(A)--(H) of 
the Act. Each State is responsible for managing its water quality 
program to implement the processes specified in the continuing planning 
process. EPA is responsible for periodically reviewing the adequacy of 
the State's CPP.
    (b) Content. The State may determine the format of its CPP as long 
as the mininum requirements of the CWA and this regulation are met. The 
following processes must be described in each State CPP, and the State 
may include other processes at its discretion.
    (1) The process for developing effluent limitations and schedules of 
compliance at least as stringent as those required by sections 301(b) 
(1) and (2), 306 and 307, and at least stringent as any requirements 
contained in applicable water quality standards in effect under 
authority of section 303 of the Act.
    (2) The process for incorporating elements of any applicable 
areawide waste treatment plans under section 208, and applicable basin 
plans under section 209 of the Act.
    (3) The process for developing total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) and 
individual water quality based effluent limitations for pollutants in 
accordance with section 303(d) of the Act and Sec. 130.7(a) of this 
regulation.
    (4) The process for updating and maintaining Water Quality 
Management (WQM) plans, including schedules for revision.

Sec. 130.6  Water quality management plans.

    (a) Water quality management (WQM) plans. WQM plans consist of 
initial plans produced in accordance with sections 208 and 303(e) of the 
Act and certified and approved updates to those plans. Continuing water 
quality planning shall be based upon WQM plans and water quality 
problems identified in the latest 305(b) reports. State water quality 
planning should focus annually on priority issues and geographic areas 
and on the development of water quality controls leading to 
implementation measures. Water quality planning directed at the removal 
of conditions placed on previously certified and approved WQM plans 
should focus on removal of conditions which will lead to control 
decisions.
    (b) Use of WQM plans. WQM plans are used to direct implementation. 
WQM plans draw upon the water quality assessments to identify priority 
point and nonpoint water quality problems, consider alternative 
solutions and recommend control measures, including the financial and 
institutional measures necessary for implementing recommended solutions. 
State annual work programs shall be based upon the priority issues 
identified in the State WQM plan.
    (c) WQM plan elements. Sections 205(j), 208 and 303 of the Act 
specify water quality planning requirements. The following plan elements 
shall be included in the WQM plan or referenced as part of the WQM plan 
if contained in separate documents when they are needed to address water 
quality problems.
    (1) Total maximum daily loads. TMDLs in accordance with sections 
303(d) and (e)(3)(C) of the Act and Sec. 130.7 of this part.

control needs and evaluating and modifying the BMPs as necessary to 
achieve water quality goals.
    (ii) Regulatory programs shall be identified where they are 
determined to be necessary by the State to attain or maintain an 
approved water use or where non-regulatory approaches are inappropriate 
in accomplishing that objective.
    (iii) BMPs shall be identified for the nonpoint sources identified 
in section 208(b)(2)(F)-(K) of the Act and other nonpoint sources as 
follows:
    (A) Residual waste. Identification of a process to control the

Sec. 130.7  Total maximum daily loads (TMDL) and individual water quality-based effluent limitations.

    (a) General. The process for identifying water quality limited 
segments still requiring wasteload allocations, load allocations and 
total maximum daily loads (WLAs/LAs and TMDLs), setting priorities for 
developing these loads; establishing these loads for segments 
identified, including water quality monitoring, modeling, data analysis, 
calculation methods, and list of pollutants to be regulated; submitting 
the State's list of segments identified, priority ranking, and loads 
established (WLAs/LAs/TMDLs) to EPA for approval; incorporating the 
approved loads into the State's WQM plans and NPDES permits; and 
involving the public, affected dischargers, designated areawide 
agencies, and local governments in this process shall be clearly 
described in the State Continuing Planning Process (CPP).
    (b) Identification and priority setting for water quality-limited 
segments still requiring TMDLs.
    (1) Each State shall identify those water quality-limited segments 
still requiring TMDLs within its boundaries for which:
    (i) Technology-based effluent limitations required by sections 
301(b), 306, 307, or other sections of the Act;
    (ii) More stringent effluent limitations (including prohibitions) 
required by either State or local authority preserved by section 510 of 
the Act, or Federal authority (law, regulation, or treaty); and
    (iii) Other pollution control requirements (e.g., best management 
practices) required by local, State, or Federal authority are not 
stringent enough to implement any water quality standards (WQS) 
applicable to such waters.
    (2) Each State shall also identify on the same list developed under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section those water quality-limited segments 
still requiring TMDLs or parts thereof within its boundaries for which 
controls on thermal discharges under section 301 or State or local 
requirements are not stringent enough to assure protection and 
propagation of a balanced indigenous population of shellfish, fish and 
wildlife.
    (3) For the purposes of listing waters under Sec. 130.7(b), the term 
``water quality standard applicable to such waters'' and ``applicable 
water quality standards'' refer to those water quality standards 
established under section 303 of the Act, including numeric criteria, 
narrative criteria, waterbody uses, and antidegradation requirements.
    (4) The list required under Secs. 130.7(b)(1) and 130.7(b)(2) of 
this section shall include a priority ranking for all listed water 
quality-limited segments still requiring TMDLs, taking into account the 
severity of the pollution and the uses to be made of such waters and 
shall identify the pollutants causing or expected to cause violations of 
the applicable water quality standards. The priority ranking shall 
specifically include the identification of waters targeted for TMDL 
development in the next two years.
    (5) Each State shall assemble and evaluate all existing and readily 
available water quality-related data and information to develop the list 
required

[[Page 594]]

by Secs. 130.7(b)(1) and 130.7(b)(2). At a minimum ``all existing and 
readily available water quality-related data and information'' includes 
but is not limited to all of the existing and readily available data and 
information about the following categories of waters:
    (i) Waters identified by the State in its most recent section 305(b) 
report as ``partially meeting'' or ``not meeting'' designated uses or as 
``threatened'';
    (ii) Waters for which dilution calculations or predictive models 
indicate nonattainment of applicable water quality standards;
    (iii) Waters for which water quality problems have been reported by 
local, state, or federal agencies; members of the public; or academic 
institutions. These organizations and groups should be actively 
solicited for research they may be conducting or reporting. For example, 
university researchers, the United States Department of Agriculture, the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the United States 
Geological Survey, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service are 
good sources of field data; and
    (iv) Waters identified by the State as impaired or threatened in a 
nonpoint assessment submitted to EPA under section 319 of the CWA or in 
any updates of the assessment.
    (6) Each State shall provide documentation to the Regional 
Administrator to support the State's determination to list or not to 
list its waters as required by Secs. 130.7(b)(1) and 130.7(b)(2). This 
documentation shall be submitted to the Regional Administrator together 
with the list required by Secs. 130.7(b)(1) and 130.7(b)(2) and shall 
include at a minimum:
    (i) A description of the methodology used to develop the list; and
    (ii) A description of the data and information used to identify 
waters, including a description of the data and information used by the 
State as required by Sec. 130.7(b)(5); and
    (iii) A rationale for any decision to not use any existing and 
readily available data and information for any one of the categories of 
waters as described in Sec. 130.7(b)(5); and
    (iv) Any other reasonable information requested by the Regional 
Administrator. Upon request by the Regional Administrator, each State 
must demonstrate good cause for not including a water or waters on the 
list. Good cause includes, but is not limited to, more recent or 
accurate data; more sophisticated water quality modeling; flaws in the 
original analysis that led to the water being listed in the categories 
in Sec. 130.7(b)(5); or changes in conditions, e.g., new control 
equipment, or elimination of discharges.
    (c) Development of TMDLs and individual water quality based effluent 
limitations.
    (1) Each State shall establish TMDLs for the water quality limited 
segments identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and in 
accordance with the priority ranking. For pollutants other than heat, 
TMDLs shall be established at levels necessary to attain and maintain 
the applicable narrative and numerical WQS with seasonal variations and 
a margin of safety which takes into account any lack of knowledge 
concerning the relationship between effluent limitations and water 
quality. Determinations of TMDLs shall take into account critical 
conditions for stream flow, loading, and water quality parameters.
    (i) TMDLs may be established using a pollutant-by-pollutant or 
biomonitoring approach. In many cases both techniques may be needed. 
Site-specific information should be used wherever possible.
    (ii) TMDLs shall be established for all pollutants preventing or 
expected to prevent attainment of water quality standards as identified 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Calculations to establish 
TMDLs shall be subject to public review as defined in the State CPP.
    (2) Each State shall estimate for the water quality limited segments 
still requiring TMDLs identified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
the total maximum daily thermal load which cannot be exceeded in order 
to assure protection and propagation of a balanced, indigenous 
population of shellfish, fish and wildlife. Such estimates shall take 
into account the normal water temperatures, flow rates, seasonal 
variations, existing sources of heat input, and the dissipative capacity 
of the

[[Page 595]]

identified waters or parts thereof. Such estimates shall include a 
calculation of the maximum heat input that can be made into each such 
part and shall include a margin of safety which takes into account any 
lack of knowledge concerning the development of thermal water quality 
criteria for protection and propagation of a balanced, indigenous 
population of shellfish, fish and wildlife in the identified waters or 
parts thereof.
    (d) Submission and EPA approval. (1) Each State shall submit 
biennially to the Regional Administrator beginning in 1992 the list of 
waters, pollutants causing impairment, and the priority ranking 
including waters targeted for TMDL development within the next two years 
as required under paragraph (b) of this section. For the 1992 biennial 
submission, these lists are due no later than October 22, 1992. 
Thereafter, each State shall submit to EPA lists required under 
paragraph (b) of this section on April 1 of every even-numbered year. 
The list of waters may be submitted as part of the State's biennial 
water quality report required by Sec. 130.8 of this part and section 
305(b) of the CWA or submitted under separate cover. All WLAs/LAs and 
TMDLs established under paragraph (c) for water quality limited segments 
shall continue to be submitted to EPA for review and approval. Schedules 
for submission of TMDLs shall be determined by the Regional 
Administrator and the State.
    (2) The Regional Administrator shall either approve or disapprove 
such listing and loadings not later than 30 days after the date of 
submission. The Regional Administrator shall approve a list developed 
under Sec. 130.7(b) that is submitted after the effective date of this 
rule only if it meets the requirements of Sec. 130.7(b). If the Regional 
Administrator approves such listing and loadings, the State shall 
incorporate them into its current WQM plan. If the Regional 
Administrator disapproves such listing and loadings, he shall, not later 
than 30 days after the date of such disapproval, identify such waters in 
such State and establish such loads for such waters as determined 
necessary to implement applicable WQS. The Regional Administrator shall 
promptly issue a public notice seeking comment on such listing and 
loadings. After considering public comment and making any revisions he 
deems appropriate, the Regional Administrator shall transmit the listing 
and loads to the State, which shall incorporate them into its current 
WQM plan.
    (e) For the specific purpose of developing information and as 
resources allow, each State shall identify all segments within its 
boundaries which it has not identified under paragraph (b) of this 
section and estimate for such waters the TMDLs with seasonal variations 
and margins of safety, for those pollutants which the Regional 
Administrator identifies under section 304(a)(2) as suitable for such 
calculation and for thermal discharges, at a level that would assure 
protection and propagation of a balanced indigenous population of fish, 
shellfish and wildlife. However, there is no requirement for such loads 
to be submitted to EPA for approval, and establishing TMDLs for those 
waters identified in paragraph (b) of this section shall be given higher 
priority.

Sec. 130.8  Water quality report.

    (a) Each State shall prepare and submit biennially to the Regional 
Administrator a water quality report in accordance with section 305(b) 
of the Act. The water quality report serves as the primary assessment of 
State water quality. Based upon the water quality data and problems 
identified in the 305(b) report, States develop water quality management 
(WQM) plan elements to help direct all subsequent control activities. 
Water quality problems identified in the 305(b) report should be 
analyzed through water quality management planning leading to the 
development of alternative controls and procedures for problems 
identified in the latest 305(b) report. States may also use the 305(b) 
report to describe ground-water quality and to guide development of 
ground-water plans and programs. Water quality problems identified in 
the 305(b) report should be emphasized and reflected in the State's WQM 
plan and annual work

[[Page 596]]

program under sections 106 and 205(j) of the Clean Water Act.
    (b) Each such report shall include but is not limited to the 
following:
    (1) A description of the water quality of all waters of the United 
States and the extent to which the quality of waters provides for the 
protection and propagation of a balanced population of shellfish, fish, 
and wildlife and allows recreational activities in and on the water.
    (2) An estimate of the extent to which CWA control programs have 
improved water quality or will improve water quality for the purposes of 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and recommendations for future actions 
necessary and identifications of waters needing action.
    (3) An estimate of the environmental, economic and social costs and 
benefits needed to achieve the objectives of the CWA and an estimate of 
the date of such achievement.
    (4) A description of the nature and extent of nonpoint source 
pollution and recommendations of programs needed to control each 
category of nonpoint sources, including an estimate of implementation 
costs.
    (5) An assessment of the water quality of all publicly owned lakes, 
including the status and trends of such water quality as specified in 
section 314(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act.
    (c) States may include a description of the nature and extent of 
ground-water pollution and recommendations of State plans or programs 
needed to maintain or improve ground-water quality.
    (d) In the years in which it is prepared the biennial section 305(b) 
report satisfies the requirement for the annual water quality report 
under section 205(j). In years when the 305(b) report is not required, 
the State may satisfy the annual section 205(j) report requirement by 
certifying that the most recently submitted section 305(b) report is 
current or by supplying an update of the sections of the most recently 
submitted section 305(b) report which require updating.

Sec. 130.9  Designation and de-designation.

    (a) Designation. Areawide planning agencies may be designated by the 
Governor in accordance with section 208(a) (2) and (3) of the Act or may 
self-designate in accordance with section 208(a)(4) of the Act. Such 
designations shall subject to EPA approval in accordance with section 
208(a)(7) of the Act.
    (b) De-designation. The Governor may modify or withdraw the planning 
designation of a designated planning agency other than an Indian tribal 
organization self-designated Sec. 130.6(c)(2) if:
    (1) The areawide agency requests such cancellation; or
    (2) The areawide agency fails to meet its planning requirements as 
specified in grant agreements, contracts or memoranda of understanding; 
or
    (3) The areawide agency no longer has the resources or the 
commitment to continue water quality planning activities within the 
designated boundaries.
    (c) Impact of de-designation. Once an areawide planning agency's 
designation has been withdrawn the State agency shall assume direct 
responsibility for continued water quality planning and oversight of 
implementation within the area.
    (d) Designated management agencies (DMA). In accordance with section 
208(c)(1) of the Act, management agencies shall be designated by the 
Governor in consultation with the designated planning agency. EPA shall 
approve such designations unless the DMA lacks the legal, financial and 
managerial authority required under section 208(c)(2) of the Act. 
Designated management agencies shall carry out responsibilities 
specified in Water Quality Management (WQM) plans. Areawide planning 
agencies shall monitor DMA activities in their area and recommend 
necessary plan changes during the WQM plan update. Where there is no 
designated areawide planning agency, States shall monitor DMA activities 
and make any necessary changes during the WQM plan update.


<R05>
Sec. 130.10  State submittals to EPA.

    (a) The following must be submitted regularly by the States to EPA:

[[Page 597]]

    (1) The section 305(b) report, in FY 84 and every two years 
thereafter, and the annual section 205(j) certification or update of the 
305(b) water quality report; (Approved by OMB under the control number 
2040-0071)
    (2) The annual State work program(s) under sections 106 and 205(j) 
of the Act; and (Approved by OMB under the control number 2010-0004)
    (3) Revisions or additions to water quality standards (WQS) 
(303(c)). (Approved by OMB under 2040-0049)
    (b) The Act also requires that each State initially submit to EPA 
and revise as necessary the following:
    (1) Continuing planning process (CPP) (303(e));
    (2) Identification of water quality-limited waters still requiring 
TMDLs (section 303(d)), pollutants, and the priority ranking including 
waters targeted for TMDL development within the next two years as 
required under Sec. 130.7(b) in accordance with the schedule set for in 
Sec. 130.7(d)(1). (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 
control number 2040-0071)
    (3) Total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) (303(d)); and
    (4) Water quality management (WQM) plan and certified and approved 
WQM plan updates (208, 303(e)). (Paragraph (b)(1), (4) approved by OMB 
under the control number 2010-0004).
    (c) The form and content of required State submittals to EPA may be 
tailored to reflect the organization and needs of the State, as long as 
the requirements and purposes of the Act, this part and, where 
applicable, 40 CFR parts 29, 30, 33 and 35, subparts A and J are met. 
The need for revision and schedule of submittals shall be agreed to 
annually with EPA as the States annual work program is developed.
    (d) Not later than February 4, 1989, each State shall submit to EPA 
for review, approval, and implementation--
    (1) A list of those waters within the State which after the 
application of effluent limitations required under section 301(b)(2) of 
the CWA cannot reasonably be anticipated to attain or maintain (i) water 
quality standards for such waters reviewed, revised, or adopted in 
accordance with section 303(c)(2)(B) of the CWA, due to toxic 
pollutants, or (ii) that water quality which shall assure protection of 
public health, public water supplies, agricultural and industrial uses, 
and the protection and propagation of a balanced population of 
shellfish, fish and wildlife, and allow recreational activities in and 
on the water;
    (2) A list of all navigable waters in such State for which the State 
does not expect the applicable standard under section 303 of the CWA 
will be achieved after the requirements of sections 301(b), 306, and 
307(b) are met, due entirely or substantially to discharges from point 
sources of any toxic pollutants listed pursuant to section 307(a);
    (3) For each segment of navigable waters included on such lists, a 
determination of the specific point source discharging any such toxic 
pollutant which is believed to be preventing or impairing such water 
quality and the amount of each such toxic pollutant discharged by each 
such source. (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 
control number 2040-0152)
    (4) For the purposes of listing waters under Sec. 130.10(d)(2), 
applicable standard means a numeric criterion for a priority pollutant 
promulgated as part of a state water quality standard. Where a state 
numeric criterion for a priority pollutant is not promulgated as part of 
a state water quality standard, for the purposes of listing waters 
``applicable standard'' means the state narrative water quality 
criterion to control a priority pollutant (e.g., no toxics in toxic 
amounts) interpreted on a chemical-by-chemical basis by applying a 
proposed state cirterion, an explicit state policy or regulation, or an 
EPA national water quality criterion, supplemented with other relevant 
information.
    (5) If a water meets either of the two conditions listed below the 
water must be listed under Sec. 130.10(d)(2) on the grounds that the 
applicable standard is not achieved or expected to be achieved due 
entirely or substantially to discharges from point sources.
    (i) Existing or additional water quality-based limits on one or more 
point sources would result in the achievement of an applicable water 
quality standard for a toxic pollutant; or

[[Page 598]]

    (ii) The discharge of a toxic pollutant from one or more point 
sources, regardless of any nonpoint source contribution of the same 
pollutant, is sufficient to cause or is expected to cause an excursion 
above the applicable water quality standard for the toxic pollutant.
    (6) Each state shall assemble and evaluate all existing and readily 
available water quality-related data and information and each state 
shall develop the lists required by paragraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3) of 
this section based upon this data and information. At a minimum, all 
existing and readily available water quality-related data and 
information includes, but is not limited to, all of the existing and 
readily available data about the following categories of waters in the 
state:
    (i) Waters where fishing or shellfish bans and/or advisories are 
currently in effect or are anticipated.
    (ii) Waters where there have been repeated fishkills or where 
abnormalities (cancers, lesions, tumors, etc.) have been observed in 
fish or other aquatic life during the last ten years.
    (iii) Waters where there are restrictions on water sports or 
recreational contact.
    (iv) Waters identified by the state in its most recent state section 
305(b) report as either ``partially achieving'' or ``not achieving'' 
designated uses.
    (v) Waters identified by the states under section 303(d) of the CWA 
as waters needing water quality-based controls.
    (vi) Waters identified by the state as priority waterbodies. (State 
Water Quality Management plans often include priority waterbody lists 
which are those waters that most need water pollution control decisions 
to achieve water quality standards or goals.)
    (vii) Waters where ambient data indicate potential or actual 
exceedances of water quality criteria due to toxic pollutants from an 
industry classified as a primary industry in appendix A of 40 CFR part 
122.
    (viii) Waters for which effluent toxicity test results indicate 
possible or actual exceedances of state water quality standards, 
including narrative ``free from'' water quality criteria or EPA water 
quality criteria where state criteria are not available.
    (ix) Waters with primary industrial major dischargers where dilution 
analyses indicate exceedances of state narrative or numeric water 
quality criteria (or EPA water quality criteria where state standards 
are not available) for toxic pollutants, ammonia, or chlorine. These 
dilution analyses must be based on estimates of discharge levels derived 
from effluent guidelines development documents, NPDES permits or permit 
application data (e.g., Form 2C), Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs), 
or other available information.
    (x) Waters with POTW dischargers requiring local pretreatment 
programs where dilution analyses indicate exceedances of state water 
quality criteria (or EPA water quality criteria where state water 
quality criteria are not available) for toxic pollutants, ammonia, or 
chlorine. These dilution analyses must be based upon data from NPDES 
permits or permit applications (e.g., Form 2C), Discharge Monitoring 
Reports (DMRs), or other available information.
    (xi) Waters with facilities not included in the previous two 
categories such as major POTWs, and industrial minor dischargers where 
dilution analyses indicate exceedances of numeric or narrative state 
water quality criteria (or EPA water quality criteria where state water 
quality criteria are not available) for toxic pollutants, ammonia, or 
chlorine. These dilution analyses must be based upon estimates of 
discharge levels derived from effluent guideline development documents, 
NPDES permits or permit application data, Discharge Monitoring Reports 
(DMRs), or other available information.
    (xii) Waters classified for uses that will not support the 
``fishable/swimmable'' goals of the Clean Water Act.
    (xiii) Waters where ambient toxicity or adverse water quality 
conditions have been reported by local, state, EPA or other Federal 
Agencies, the private sector, public interest groups, or universities. 
These organizations and groups should be actively solicited for

[[Page 599]]

research they may be conducting or reporting. For example, university 
researchers, the United States Department of Agriculture, the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the United States Geological 
Survey, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service are good sources 
of field data and research.
    (xiv) Waters identified by the state as impaired in its most recent 
Clean Lake Assessments conducted under section 314 of the Clean Water 
Act.
    (xv) Waters identified as impaired by nonpoint sources in the 
America's Clean Water: The States' Nonpoint Source Assessments 1985 
(Association of State and Interstate Water Pollution Control 
Administrators (ASIWPCA)) or waters identified as impaired or threatened 
in a nonpoint source assessment submitted by the state to EPA under 
section 319 of the Clean Water Act.
    (xvi) Surface waters impaired by pollutants from hazardous waste 
sites on the National Priority List prepared under section 105(8)(A) of 
CERCLA.
    (7) Each state shall provide documentation to the Regional 
Administrator to support the state's determination to list or not to 
list waters as required by paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this 
section. This documentation shall be submitted to the Regional 
Administrator together with the lists required by paragraphs (d)(1), 
(d)(2), and (d)(3) of this section and shall include as a minimum:
    (i) A description of the methodology used to develop each list;
    (ii) A description of the data and information used to identify

categories of existing and readily available data required by paragraph 
(d)(6) of this section; and
    (iv) Any other information requested by the Regional Administrator 
that is reasonable or necessary to determine the adequacy of a state's 
lists. Upon request by the Regional Administrator, each state must 
demonstrate good cause for not including a water or waters on one or 
more lists. Good cause includes, but is not limited to, more recent or 
accurate data; more accurate water quality modeling; flaws in the 
original analysis that led to the water being identified in a category 
in Sec. 130.10(d)(6); or changes in conditions, e.g., new control 
equipment, or elimination of discharges.
    (8) The Regional Administrator shall approve or disapprove each list 
required by paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) of this section no 
later than June 4, 1989. The Regional Administrator shall approve each 
list required under paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) of this 
section only if it meets the regulatory requirements for listing under 
paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) of this section and if the state 
has met all the requirements of paragraphs (d)(6) and (d)(7) of this 
section.
    (9) If a state fails to submit lists in accordance with paragraph 
(d) of this section or the Regional Administrator does not approve the 
lists submitted by such state in accordance with this paragraph, then 
not later than June 4, 1990, the Regional Administrator, in cooperation 
with such state, shall implement the requirements of CWA section 304(l) 
(1) and (2) in such state.

Sec. 130.11  Program management.

    (a) State agencies may apply for grants under sections 106, 205(j) 
and 205(g) to carry out water quality planning and management 
activities. Interstate agencies may apply for grants under section 106 
to carry out water quality planning and management activities. Local or 
regional planning organizations may request 106 and 205(j) funds from a 
State for planning and management activities. Grant administrative 
requirements for these funds appear in 40 CFR parts 25, 29, 30, 33 and 
35, subparts A and J.
    (b) Grants under section 106 may be used to fund a wide range of 
activities, including but not limited to assessments of water quality, 
revision of water quality standards (WQS), development of alternative 
approaches to control pollution, implementation and enforcement of 
control measures and development or implementation of ground water 
programs. Grants under section 205(j) may be used to fund water quality 
management (WQM) planning activities but may not be used to fund 
implementation of control measures (see part 35, subpart A). Section 
205(g) funds are used primarily to manage the wastewater treatment works 
construction grants program pursuant to the provisions of 40 CFR part 
35, subpart J. A State may also use part of the 205(g) funds to 
administer approved permit programs under sections 402 and 404, to 
administer a statewide waste treatment management program under section 
208(b)(4) and to manage waste treatment construction grants for small 
communities.
    (c) Grant work programs for water quality planning and management 
shall describe geographic and functional priorities for use of grant 
funds in a manner which will facilitate EPA review of the grant 
application and subsequent evaluation of work accomplished with the 
grant funds. A State's 305(b) Report, WQM plan and other water quality 
assessments shall identify the State's priority water quality problems 
and areas. The WQM plan shall contain an analysis of alternative control 
measures and recommendations to control specific problems. Work programs 
shall specify the activities to be carried out during the period of the 
grant; the cost of specific activities; the outputs, for example, 
permits issued, intensive surveys, wasteload allocations, to be produced 
by each activity; and where applicable, schedules indicating when 
activities are to be completed.
    (d) State work programs under sections 106, 205(j) and 205(g) shall 
be coordinated in a manner which indicates the funding from these grants 
dedicated to major functions, such as permitting, enforcement, 
monitoring, planning and standards, nonpoint source implementation, 
management of construction grants, operation and maintenance of 
treatment works,

[[Page 601]]

ground-water, emergency response and program management. States shall 
also describe how the activities funded by these grants are used in a 
coordinated manner to address the priority water quality problems 
identified in the State's water quality assessment under section 305(b).
    (e) EPA, States, areawide agencies, interstate agencies, local and 
Regional governments, and designated management agencies (DMAs) are 
joint participants in the water pollution control program. States may 
enter into contractual arrangements or intergovernmental agreements with 
other agencies concerning the performance of water quality planning and 
management tasks. Such arrangements shall reflect the capabilities of 
the respective agencies and shall efficiently utilize available funds 
and funding eligibilities to meet Federal requirements commensurate with 
State and local priorities. State work programs under section 205(j) 
shall be developed jointly with local, Regional and other comprehensive 
planning organizations.


<R05>
Sec. 130.12  Coordination with other programs.

    (a) Relationship to the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination 
System (NPDES) program. In accordance with section 208(e) of the Act, no 
NPDES permit may be issued which is in conflict with an approved Water 
Quality Management (WQM) plan. Where a State has assumed responsibility 
for the administration of the permit program under section 402, it shall 
assure consistency with the WQM plan.
    (b) Relationship to the municipal construction grants program. In 
accordance with sections 205(j), 216 and 303(e)(3)(H) of the Act, each 
State shall develop a system for setting priorities for funding 
construction of municipal wastewater treatment facilities under section 
201 of the Act. The State, or the agency to which the State has 
delegated WQM planning functions, shall review each facility plan in its 
area for consistency with the approved WQM plan. Under section 208(d) of 
the Act, after a waste treatment management agency has been designated 
and a WQM plan approved, section 201 construction grant funds may be 
awarded only to those agencies for construction of treatment works in 
conformity with the approved WQM plan.
    (c) Relationship to Federal activities--Each department, agency or 
instrumentality of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of 
the Federal Government having jurisdiction over any property or facility 
or engaged in any activity resulting, or which may result, in the 
discharge or runoff of pollutants shall comply with all Federal, State, 
interstate and local requirements, administrative authority, and process 
and sanctions respecting the control and abatement of water pollution in 
the same manner and extent as any non-governmental entity in accordance 
with section 313 of the CWA.


<R05>
Sec. 130.15  Processing application for Indian tribes.

    The Regional Administrator shall process an application of an Indian 
Tribe submitted under Sec. 130.6(d) in a timely manner. He shall 
promptly notify the Indian Tribe of receipt of the application.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 131.1  Scope.

    This part describes the requirements and procedures for developing, 
reviewing, revising, and approving water quality standards by the States 
as authorized by section 303(c) of the Clean Water Act. Additional 
specific procedures for developing, reviewing, revising, and approving 
water quality standards for Great Lakes States or Great Lakes Tribes (as 
defined in 40 CFR 132.2) to conform to section 118 of the Clean Water 
Act and 40 CFR part 132, are provided in 40 CFR part 132.

[60 FR 15386, Mar. 23, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 131.2  Purpose.

    A water quality standard defines the water quality goals of a water 
body, or portion thereof, by designating the use or uses to be made of 
the water and by setting criteria necessary to protect the uses. States 
adopt water quality standards to protect public health or welfare, 
enhance the quality of water and serve the purposes of the Clean Water 
Act (the Act). ``Serve the purposes of the Act'' (as defined in sections 
101(a)(2) and 303(c) of the Act) means that water quality standards 
should, wherever attainable, provide water quality for the protection 
and propagation of fish, shellfish and wildlife and for recreation in 
and on the water and take into consideration their use and value of 
public water supplies, propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife, 
recreation in and on the water, and agricultural, industrial, and other 
purposes including navigation.

Such standards serve the dual purposes of establishing the water quality 
goals for a specific water body and serve as the regulatory basis for 
the establishment of water-quality-based treatment controls and 
strategies beyond the technology-based levels of treatment required by 
sections 301(b) and 306 of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 131.3  Definitions.

    (a) The Act means the Clean Water Act (Pub. L. 92-500, as amended 
(33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.)).
    (b) Criteria are elements of State water quality standards, 
expressed as constituent concentrations, levels, or narrative 
statements, representing a quality of water that supports a particular 
use. When criteria are met, water quality will generally protect the 
designated use.
    (c) Section 304(a) criteria are developed by EPA under authority of 
section 304(a) of the Act based on the latest scientific information on 
the relationship that the effect of a constituent concentration has on 
particular aquatic species and/or human health. This information is 
issued periodically to the States as guidance for use in developing 
criteria.
    (d) Toxic pollutants are those pollutants listed by the 
Administrator under section 307(a) of the Act.
    (e) Existing uses are those uses actually attained in the water body 
on or after November 28, 1975, whether or not they are included in the 
water quality standards.
    (f) Designated uses are those uses specified in water quality 
standards for each water body or segment whether or not they are being 
attained.
    (g) Use attainability analysis is a structured scientific assessment 
of the factors affecting the attainment of the use which may include 
physical, chemical, biological, and economic factors as described in 
Sec. 131.10(g).
    (h) Water quality limited segment means any segment where it is 
known

[[Page 603]]

that water quality does not meet applicable water quality standards, 
and/or is not expected to meet applicable water quality standards, even 
after the application of the technology-bases effluent limitations 
required by sections 301(b) and 306 of the Act.
    (i) Water quality standards are provisions of State or Federal law 
which consist of a designated use or uses for the waters of the United 
States and water quality criteria for such waters based upon such uses. 
Water quality standards are to protect the public health or welfare, 
enhance the quality of water and serve the purposes of the Act.
    (j) States include: The 50 States, the District of Columbia, Guam, 
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the 
Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands, and Indian Tribes that EPA determines to be eligible 
for purposes of water quality standards program.
    (k) Federal Indian Reservation, Indian Reservation, or Reservation 
means all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the 
jurisdiction of the United States Government, notwithstanding the 
issuance of any patent, and including rights-of-way running through the 
reservation.''
    (l) Indian Tribe or Tribe means any Indian Tribe, band, group, or 
community recognized by the Secretary of the Interior and exercising 
governmental authority over a Federal Indian reservation.

FR 64344, Dec. 14, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 131.4  State authority.

    (a) States (as defined in Sec. 131.3) are responsible for reviewing, 
establishing, and revising water quality standards. As recognized by 
section 510 of the Clean Water Act, States may develop water quality 
standards more stringent than required by this regulation. Consistent 
with section 101(g) and 518(a) of the Clean Water Act, water quality 
standards shall not be construed to supersede or abrogate rights to 
quantities of water.
    (b) States (as defined in Sec. 131.3) may issue certifications 
pursuant to the requirements of Clean Water Act section 401. Revisions 
adopted by States shall be applicable for use in issuing State 
certifications consistent with the provisions of Sec. 131.21(c).
    (c) Where EPA determines that a Tribe is eligible to the same extent 
as a State for purposes of water quality standards, the Tribe likewise 
is eligible to the same extent as a State for purposes of certifications 
conducted under Clean Water Act section 401.

[56 FR 64893, Dec. 12, 1991, as amended at 59 FR 64344, Dec. 14, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 131.5  EPA authority.

    (a) Under section 303(c) of the Act, EPA is to review and to approve 
or disapprove State-adopted water quality standards. The review involves 
a determination of:
    (1) Whether the State has adopted water uses which are consistent 
with the requirements of the Clean Water Act;
    (2) Whether the State has adopted criteria that protect the 
designated water uses;
    (3) Whether the State has followed its legal procedures for revising 
or adopting standards;
    (4) Whether the State standards which do not include the uses 
specified in section 101(a)(2) of the Act are based upon appropriate 
technical and scientific data and analyses, and
    (5) Whether the State submission meets the requirements included in 
Sec. 131.6 of this part and, for Great Lakes States or Great Lakes 
Tribes (as defined in 40 CFR 132.2) to conform to section 118 of the 
Act, the requirements of 40 CFR part 132.
    (b) If EPA determines that the State's or Tribe's water quality 
standards are consistent with the factors listed in paragraphs (a)(1) 
through (a)(5) of this section, EPA approves the standards. EPA must 
disapprove the State's or Tribe's water quality standards and promulgate 
Federal standards under section 303(c)(4), and for Great Lakes States or 
Great Lakes Tribes under section 118(c)(2)(C) of the Act, if State or 
Tribal adopted standards are not consistent with the factors listed in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section. EPA may also 
promulgate

[[Page 604]]

a new or revised standard when necessary to meet the requirements of the 
Act.
    (c) Section 401 of the Clean Water Act authorizes EPA to issue 
certifications pursuant to the requirements of section 401 in any case 
where a State or interstate agency has no authority for issuing such 
certifications.

[48 FR 51405, Nov. 8, 1983, as amended at 56 FR 64894, Dec. 12, 1991; 60 
FR 15387, Mar. 23, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 131.6  Minimum requirements for water quality standards submission.

    The following elements must be included in each State's water 
quality standards submitted to EPA for review:
    (a) Use designations consistent with the provisions of sections 
101(a)(2) and 303(c)(2) of the Act.
    (b) Methods used and analyses conducted to support water quality 
standards revisions.
    (c) Water quality criteria sufficient to protect the designated 
uses.
    (d) An antidegradation policy consistent with Sec. 131.12.
    (e) Certification by the State Attorney General or other appropriate 
legal authority within the State that the water quality standards were 
duly adopted pursuant to State law.
    (f) General information which will aid the Agency in determining the 
adequacy of the scientific basis of the standards which do not include 
the uses specified in section 101(a)(2) of the Act as well as 
information on general policies applicable to State standards which may 
affect their application and implementation.


<R05>
Sec. 131.7  Dispute resolution mechanism.

    (a) Where disputes between States and Indian Tribes arise as a 
result of differing water quality standards on common bodies of water, 
the lead EPA Regional Administrator, as determined based upon OMB 
circular A-105, shall be responsible for acting in accordance with the 
provisions of this section.
    (b) The Regional Administrator shall attempt to resolve such 
disputes where:
    (1) The difference in water quality standards results in 
unreasonable consequences;
    (2) The dispute is between a State (as defined in Sec. 131.3(j) but 
exclusive of all Indian Tribes) and a Tribe which EPA has determined is 
eligible to the same extent as a State for purposes of water quality 
standards;
    (3) A reasonable effort to resolve the dispute without EPA 
involvement has been made;
    (4) The requested relief is consistent with the provisions of the 
Clean Water Act and other relevant law;
    (5) The differing State and Tribal water quality standards have been 
adopted pursuant to State and Tribal law and approved by EPA; and
    (6) A valid written request has been submitted by either the Tribe 
or the State.
    (c) Either a State or a Tribe may request EPA to resolve any dispute 
which satisfies the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section. Written 
requests for EPA involvement should be submitted to the lead Regional 
Administrator and must include:
    (1) A concise statement of the unreasonable consequences that are 
alleged to have arisen because of differing water quality standards;
    (2) A concise description of the actions which have been taken to 
resolve the dispute without EPA involvement;
    (3) A concise indication of the water quality standards provision 
which has resulted in the alleged unreasonable consequences;
    (4) Factual data to support the alleged unreasonable consequences; 
and
    (5) A statement of the relief sought from the alleged unreasonable 
consequences.
    (d) Where, in the Regional Administrator's judgment, EPA involvement 
is appropriate based on the factors of paragraph (b) of this section, 
the Regional Administrator shall, within 30 days, notify the parties in 
writing that he/she is initiating an EPA dispute resolution action and 
solicit their written response. The Regional Administrator shall also 
make reasonable efforts to ensure that other interested individuals or 
groups have notice of this action. Such efforts shall include but not be 
limited to the following:
    (1) Written notice to responsible Tribal and State Agencies, and 
other affected Federal agencies,

[[Page 605]]

    (2) Notice to the specific individual or entity that is alleging 
that an unreasonable consequence is resulting from differing standards 
having been adopted on a common body of water,
    (3) Public notice in local newspapers, radio, and television, as 
appropriate,
    (4) Publication in trade journal newsletters, and
    (5) Other means as appropriate.
    (e) If in accordance with applicable State and Tribal law an Indian 
Tribe and State have entered into an agreement that resolves the dispute 
or establishes a mechanism for resolving a dispute, EPA shall defer to 
this agreement where it is consistent with the Clean Water Act and where 
it has been approved by EPA.
    (f) EPA dispute resolution actions shall be consistent with one or a 
combination of the following options:
    (1) Mediation. The Regional Administrator may appoint a mediator to 
mediate the dispute. Mediators shall be EPA employees, employees from 
other Federal agencies, or other individuals with appropriate 
qualifications.
    (i) Where the State and Tribe agree to participate in the dispute 
resolution process, mediation with the intent to establish Tribal-State 
agreements, consistent with Clean Water Act section 518(d), shall 
normally be pursued as a first effort.
    (ii) Mediators shall act as neutral facilitators whose function is 
to encourage communication and negotiation between all parties to the 
dispute.
    (iii) Mediators may establish advisory panels, to consist in part of 
representatives from the affected parties, to study the problem and 
recommend an appropriate solution.
    (iv) The procedure and schedule for mediation of individual disputes 
shall be determined by the mediator in consultation with the parties.
    (v) If formal public hearings are held in connection with the 
actions taken under this paragraph, Agency requirements at 40 CFR 25.5 
shall be followed.
    (2) Arbitration. Where the parties to the dispute agree to 
participate in the dispute resolution process, the Regional 
Administrator may appoint an arbitrator or arbitration panel to 
arbitrate the dispute. Arbitrators and panel members shall be EPA 
employees, employees from other Federal agencies, or other individuals 
with appropriate qualifications. The Regional administrator shall select 
as arbitrators and arbitration panel members individuals who are 
agreeable to all parties, are knowledgeable concerning the requirements 
of the water quality standards program, have a basic understanding of 
the political and economic interests of Tribes and States involved, and 
are expected to fulfill the duties fairly and impartially.
    (i) The arbitrator or arbitration panel shall conduct one or more 
private or public meetings with the parties and actively solicit 
information pertaining to the effects of differing water quality permit 
requirements on upstream and downstream dischargers, comparative risks 
to public health and the environment, economic impacts, present and 
historical water uses, the quality of the waters subject to such 
standards, and other factors relevant to the dispute, such as whether 
proposed water quality criteria are more stringent than necessary to 
support designated uses, more stringent than natural background water 
quality or whether designated uses are reasonable given natural 
background water quality.
    (ii) Following consideration of relevant factors as defined in 
paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, the arbitrator or arbitration panel 
shall have the authority and responsibility to provide all parties and 
the Regional Administrator with a written recommendation for resolution 
of the dispute. Arbitration panel recommendations shall, in general, be 
reached by majority vote. However, where the parties agree to binding 
arbitration, or where required by the Regional Administrator, 
recommendations of such arbitration panels may be unanimous decisions. 
Where binding or non-binding arbitration panels cannot reach a unanimous 
recommendation after a reasonable period of time, the Regional 
Administrator may direct the panel to issue a non-binding decision by 
majority vote.
    (iii) The arbitrator or arbitration panel members may consult with 
EPA's Office of General Counsel on legal issues, but otherwise shall 
have no ex parte communications pertaining

[[Page 606]]

to the dispute. Federal employees who are arbitrators or arbitration 
panel members shall be neutral and shall not be predisposed for or 
against the position of any disputing party based on any Federal Trust 
responsibilities which their employers may have with respect to the 
Tribe. In addition, arbitrators or arbitration panel members who are 
Federal employees shall act independently from the normal hierarchy 
within their agency.
    (iv) The parties are not obligated to abide by the arbitrator's or 
arbitration panel's recommendation unless they voluntarily entered into 
a binding agreement to do so.
    (v) If a party to the dispute believes that the arbitrator or 
arbitration panel has recommended an action contrary to or inconsistent 
with the Clean Water Act, the party may appeal the arbitrator's 
recommendation to the Regional Administrator. The request for appeal 
must be in writing and must include a description of the statutory basis 
for altering the arbitrator's recommendation.
    (vi) The procedure and schedule for arbitration of individual 
disputes shall be determined by the arbitrator or arbitration panel in 
consultation with parties.
    (vii) If formal public hearings are held in connection with the 
actions taken under this paragraph, Agency requirements at 40 CFR 25.5 
shall be followed.
    (3) Dispute resolution default procedure. Where one or more parties 
(as defined in paragraph (g) of this section) refuse to participate in 
either the mediation or arbitration dispute resolution processes, the 
Regional Administrator may appoint a single official or panel to review 
available information pertaining to the dispute and to issue a written 
recommendation for resolving the dispute. Review officials shall be EPA 
employees, employees from other Federal agencies, or other individuals 
with appropriate qualifications. Review panels shall include appropriate 
members to be selected by the Regional Administrator in consultation 
with the participating parties. Recommendations of such review officials 
or panels shall, to the extent possible given the lack of participation 
by one or more parties, be reached in a manner identical to that for 
arbitration of disputes specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through 
(f)(2)(vii) of this section.
    (g) Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
    (1) Dispute Resolution Mechanism means the EPA mechanism established 
pursuant to the requirements of Clean Water Act section 518(e) for 
resolving unreasonable consequences that arise as a result of differing 
water quality standards that may be set by States and Indian Tribes 
located on common bodies of water.
    (2) Parties to a State-Tribal dispute include the State and the 
Tribe and may, at the discretion of the Regional Administrator, include 
an NPDES permittee, citizen, citizen group, or other affected entity.

<R04>
           Subpart B--Establishment of Water Quality Standards


<R05>
Sec. 131.10  Designation of uses.

    (a) Each State must specify appropriate water uses to be achieved 
and protected. The classification of the waters of the State must take 
into consideration the use and value of water for public water supplies, 
protection and propagation of fish, shellfish and wildlife, recreation 
in and on the water, agricultural, industrial, and other purposes 
including navigation. In no case shall a State adopt waste transport or 
waste assimilation as a designated use for any waters of the United 
States.
    (b) In designating uses of a water body and the appropriate criteria 
for those uses, the State shall take into consideration the water 
quality standards of downstream waters and shall ensure that its water 
quality standards provide for the attainment and maintenance of the 
water quality standards of downstream waters.
    (c) States may adopt sub-categories of a use and set the appropriate 
criteria to reflect varying needs of such sub-categories of uses, for 
instance, to differentiate between cold water and warm water fisheries.
    (d) At a minimum, uses are deemed attainable if they can be achieved 
by the imposition of effluent limits required under sections 301(b) and 
306 of the Act and cost-effective and reasonable best management 
practices for nonpoint source control.
    (e) Prior to adding or removing any use, or establishing sub-
categories of a use, the State shall provide notice and an opportunity 
for a public hearing under Sec. 131.20(b) of this regulation.
    (f) States may adopt seasonal uses as an alternative to 
reclassifying a water body or segment thereof to uses requiring less 
stringent water quality criteria. If seasonal uses are adopted, water 
quality criteria should be adjusted to reflect the seasonal uses, 
however, such criteria shall not preclude the attainment and maintenance 
of a more protective use in another season.
    (g) States may remove a designated use which is not an existing use, 
as defined in Sec. 131.3, or establish sub-categories of a use if the 
State can demonstrate that attaining the designated use is not feasible 
because:
    (1) Naturally occurring pollutant concentrations prevent the 
attainment of the use; or
    (2) Natural, ephemeral, intermittent or low flow conditions or water 
levels prevent the attainment of the use, unless these conditions may be 
compensated for by the discharge of sufficient volume of effluent 
discharges without violating State water conservation requirements to 
enable uses to be met; or
    (3) Human caused conditions or sources of pollution prevent the 
attainment of the use and cannot be remedied or would cause more 
environmental damage to correct than to leave in place; or
    (4) Dams, diversions or other types of hydrologic modifications 
preclude the attainment of the use, and it is not feasible to restore 
the water body to its original condition or to operate such modification 
in a way that would result in the attainment of the use; or

[[Page 609]]

    (5) Physical conditions related to the natural features of the water 
body, such as the lack of a proper substrate, cover, flow, depth, pools, 
riffles, and the like, unrelated to water quality, preclude attainment 
of aquatic life protection uses; or
    (6) Controls more stringent than those required by sections 301(b) 
and 306 of the Act would result in substantial and widespread economic 
and social impact.
    (h) States may not remove designated uses if:
    (1) They are existing uses, as defined in Sec. 131.3, unless a use 
requiring more stringent criteria is added; or
    (2) Such uses will be attained by implementing effluent limits 
required under sections 301(b) and 306 of the Act and by implementing 
cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint 
source control.
    (i) Where existing water quality standards specify designated uses 
less than those which are presently being attained, the State shall 
revise its standards to reflect the uses actually being attained.
    (j) A State must conduct a use attainability analysis as described 
in Sec. 131.3(g) whenever:
    (1) The State designates or has designated uses that do not include 
the uses specified in section 101(a)(2) of the Act, or
    (2) The State wishes to remove a designated use that is specified in 
section 101(a)(2) of the Act or to adopt subcategories of uses specified 
in section 101(a)(2) of the Act which require less stringent criteria.
    (k) A State is not required to conduct a use attainability analysis 
under this regulation whenever designating uses which include those 
specified in section 101(a)(2) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 131.11  Criteria.

    (a) Inclusion of pollutants: (1) States must adopt those water 
quality criteria that protect the designated use. Such criteria must be 
based on sound scientific rationale and must contain sufficient 
parameters or constituents to protect the designated use. For waters 
with multiple use designations, the criteria shall support the most 
sensitive use.
    (2) Toxic pollutants. States must review water quality data and 
information on discharges to identify specific water bodies where toxic 
pollutants may be adversely affecting water quality or the attainment of 
the designated water use or where the levels of toxic pollutants are at 
a level to warrant concern and must adopt criteria for such toxic 
pollutants applicable to the water body sufficient to protect the 
designated use. Where a State adopts narrative criteria for toxic 
pollutants to protect designated uses, the State must provide 
information identifying the method by which the State intends to 
regulate point source discharges of toxic pollutants on water quality 
limited segments based on such narrative criteria. Such information may 
be included as part of the standards or may be included in documents 
generated by the State in response to the Water Quality Planning and 
Management Regulations (40 CFR part 35).
    (b) Form of criteria: In establishing criteria, States should:
    (1) Establish numerical values based on:
    (i) 304(a) Guidance; or
    (ii) 304(a) Guidance modified to reflect site-specific conditions; 
or
    (iii) Other scientifically defensible methods;
    (2) Establish narrative criteria or criteria based upon 
biomonitoring methods where numerical criteria cannot be established or 
to supplement numerical criteria.


<R05>
Sec. 131.12  Antidegradation policy.

    (a) The State shall develop and adopt a statewide antidegradation 
policy and identify the methods for implementing such policy pursuant to 
this subpart. The antidegradation policy and implementation methods 
shall, at a minimum, be consistent with the following:
    (1) Existing instream water uses and the level of water quality 
necessary to protect the existing uses shall be maintained and 
protected.
    (2) Where the quality of the waters exceed levels necessary to 
support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in 
and on the water, that quality shall be maintained and protected unless 
the State finds, after

[[Page 610]]

full satisfaction of the intergovernmental coordination and public 
participation provisions of the State's continuing planning process, 
that allowing lower water quality is necessary to accommodate important 
economic or social development in the area in which the waters are 
located. In allowing such degradation or lower water quality, the State 
shall assure water quality adequate to protect existing uses fully. 
Further, the State shall assure that there shall be achieved the highest 
statutory and regulatory requirements for all new and existing point 
sources and all cost-effective and reasonable best management practices 
for nonpoint source control.
    (3) Where high quality waters constitute an outstanding National 
resource, such as waters of National and State parks and wildlife 
refuges and waters of exceptional recreational or ecological 
significance, that water quality shall be maintained and protected.
    (4) In those cases where potential water quality impairment 
associated with a thermal discharge is involved, the antidegradation 
policy and implementing method shall be consistent with section 316 of 
the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 131.13  General policies.

    States may, at their discretion, include in their State standards, 
policies generally affecting their application and implementation, such 
as mixing zones, low flows and variances. Such policies are subject to 
EPA review and approval.


<R04>
Subpart C--Procedures for Review and Revision of Water Quality Standards


<R05>
Sec. 131.20  State review and revision of water quality standards.

    (a) State review. The State shall from time to time, but at least 
once every three years, hold public hearings for the purpose of 
reviewing applicable water quality standards and, as appropriate, 
modifying and adopting standards. Any water body segment with water 
quality standards that do not include the uses specified in section 
101(a)(2) of the Act shall be re-examined every three years to determine 
if any new information has become available. If such new information 
indicates that the uses specified in section 101(a)(2) of the Act are 
attainable, the State shall revise its standards accordingly. Procedures 
States establish for identifying and reviewing water bodies for review 
should be incorporated into their Continuing Planning Process.
    (b) Public participation. The State shall hold a public hearing for 
the purpose of reviewing water quality standards, in accordance with 
provisions of State law, EPA's water quality management regulation (40 
CFR 130.3(b)(6)) and public participation regulation (40 CFR part 25). 
The proposed water quality standards revision and supporting analyses 
shall be made available to the public prior to the hearing.
    (c) Submittal to EPA. The State shall submit the results of the 
review, any supporting analysis for the use attainability analysis, the 
methodologies used for site-specific criteria development, any general 
policies applicable to water quality standards and any revisions of the 
standards to the Regional Administrator for review and approval, within 
30 days of the final State action to adopt and certify the revised 
standard, or if no revisions are made as a result of the review, within 
30 days of the completion of the review.


<R05>
Sec. 131.21  EPA review and approval of water quality standards.

    (a) After the State submits its officially adopted revisions, the 
Regional Administrator shall either:
    (1) Notify the State within 60 days that the revisions are approved, 
or
    (2) Notify the State within 90 days that the revisions are 
disapproved. Such notification of disapproval shall specify the changes 
needed to assure compliance with the requirements of the Act and this 
regulation, and shall explain why the State standard is not in 
compliance with such requirements. Any new or revised State standard 
must be accompanied by some type of supporting analysis.
    (b) The Regional Administrator's approval or disapproval of a State 
water quality standard shall be based on the requirements of the Act as 
described in Secs. 131.5 and 131.6, and, with respect to

[[Page 611]]

Great Lakes States or Tribes (as defined in 40 CFR 132.2), 40 CFR part 
132.
    (c) A State water quality standard remains in effect, even though 
disapproved by EPA, until the State revises it or EPA promulgates a rule 
that supersedes the State water quality standard.
    (d) EPA shall, at least annually, publish in the Federal Register a 
notice of approvals under this section.

[48 FR 51405, Nov. 8, 1983, as amended at 60 FR 15387, Mar. 23, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 131.22  EPA promulgation of water quality standards.

    (a) If the State does not adopt the changes specified by the 
Regional Administrator within 90 days after notification of the Regional 
Administrator's disapproval, the Administrator shall promptly propose 
and promulgate such standard.
    (b) The Administrator may also propose and promulgate a regulation, 
applicable to one or more States, setting forth a new or revised 
standard upon determining such a standard is necessary to meet the 
requirements of the Act.
    (c) In promulgating water quality standards, the Administrator is 
subject to the same policies, procedures, analyses, and public 
participation requirements established for States in these regulations.

Secs. 131.33--131.34  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 131.35  Colville Confederated Tribes Indian Reservation.

    The water quality standards applicable to the waters within the 
Colville Indian Reservation, located in the State of Washington.
    (a) Background. (1) It is the purpose of these Federal water quality 
standards to prescribe minimum water quality requirements for the 
surface waters located within the exterior boundaries of the Colville 
Indian Reservation to ensure compliance with section 303(c) of the Clean 
Water Act.
    (2) The Colville Confederated Tribes have a primary interest in the 
protection, control, conservation, and utilization of the water 
resources of the Colville Indian Reservation. Water quality standards 
have been enacted into tribal law by the Colville Business Council of 
the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, as the Colville 
Water Quality Standards Act, CTC Title 33 (Resolution No. 1984-526 
(August 6, 1984) as amended by Resolution No. 1985-20 (January 18, 
1985)).
    (b) Territory Covered. The provisions of these water quality 
standards shall apply to all surface waters within the exterior 
boundaries of the Colville Indian Reservation.
    (c) Applicability, Administration and Amendment. (1) The water 
quality standards in this section shall be used by the Regional 
Administrator for establishing any water quality based National 
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit (NPDES) for point sources 
on the Colville Confederated Tribes Reservation.
    (2) In conjunction with the issuance of section 402 or section 404 
permits, the Regional Administrator may designate mixing zones in the 
waters of the United States on the reservation on a case-by-case basis. 
The size of such mixing zones and the in-zone water quality in such 
mixing zones shall be consistent with the applicable procedures and 
guidelines in EPA's Water Quality Standards Handbook and the Technical 
Support Document for Water Quality Based Toxics Control.
    (3) Amendments to the section at the request of the Tribe shall 
proceed in the following manner.
    (i) The requested amendment shall first be duly approved by the 
Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation (and so certified by the 
Tribes Legal Counsel) and submitted to the Regional Administrator.
    (ii) The requested amendment shall be reviewed by EPA (and by the 
State of Washington, if the action would affect a boundary water).
    (iii) If deemed in compliance with the Clean Water Act, EPA will 
propose and promulgate an appropriate change to this section.
    (4) Amendment of this section at EPA's initiative will follow 
consultation with the Tribe and other appropriate entities. Such 
amendments will then follow normal EPA rulemaking procedures.
    (5) All other applicable provisions of this part 131 shall apply on 
the Colville

    (e) General considerations. The following general guidelines shall 
apply to the water quality standards and classifications set forth in 
the use designation Sections.
    (1) Classification boundaries. At the boundary between waters of 
different classifications, the water quality standards for the higher 
classification shall prevail.
    (2) Antidegradation policy. This antidegradation policy shall be 
applicable to all surface waters of the Reservation.
    (i) Existing in-stream water uses and the level of water quality 
necessary to protect the existing uses shall be maintained and 
protected.
    (ii) Where the quality of the waters exceeds levels necessary to 
support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in 
and on the water, that quality shall be maintained and protected unless 
the Regional Administrator finds, after full satisfaction of the inter-
governmental coordination and public participation provisions of the 
Tribes' continuing planning process, that allowing lower water quality 
is necessary to accommodate important economic or social development in 
the area in which the waters are located. In allowing such degradation 
or lower water quality, the Regional Administrator shall assure water 
quality adequate to protect existing uses fully. Further, the Regional 
Administrator shall assure that there shall be achieved the highest 
statutory and regulatory requirements for all new and existing point 
sources and all cost-effective and reasonable best management practices 
for nonpoint source control.
    (iii) Where high quality waters are identified as constituting an 
outstanding national or reservation resource, such as waters within 
areas designated as unique water quality management areas and waters 
otherwise of exceptional recreational or ecological significance, and 
are designated as special resource waters, that water quality shall be 
maintained and protected.
    (iv) In those cases where potential water quality impairment 
associated with a thermal discharge is involved, this antidegradation 
policy's implementing method shall be consistent with section 316 of the 
Clean Water Act.
    (3) Aesthetic qualities. All waters within the Reservation, 
including those within mixing zones, shall be free from substances, 
attributable to wastewater discharges or other pollutant sources, that:
    (i) Settle to form objectionable deposits;
    (ii) Float as debris, scum, oil, or other matter forming nuisances;
    (iii) Produce objectionable color, odor, taste, or turbidity;
    (iv) Cause injury to, are toxic to, or produce adverse physiological 
responses in humans, animals, or plants; or
    (v) produce undesirable or nuisance aquatic life.
    (4) Analytical methods. (i) The analytical testing methods used to 
measure or otherwise evaluate compliance with water quality standards 
shall to the extent practicable, be in accordance with the ``Guidelines 
Establishing Test Procedures for the Analysis of Pollutants'' (40 CFR 
part 136). When a testing method is not available for a particular 
substance, the most recent edition of ``Standard Methods for the 
Examination of Water and Wastewater'' (published by the American Public 
Health Association, American Water Works Association, and the Water 
Pollution Control Federation) and other or superseding methods published 
and/or approved by EPA shall be used.
    (f) General water use and criteria classes. The following criteria 
shall apply to the various classes of surface waters on the Colville 
Indian Reservation:
    (1) Class I (Extraordinary)--(i) Designated uses. The designated

[54 FR 28625, July 6, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 131.36  Toxics criteria for those states not complying with Clean Water Act section 303(c)(2)(B).

    (a) Scope. This section is not a general promulgation of the section 
304(a) criteria for priority toxic pollutants but is restricted to 
specific pollutants in specific States.
    (b)(1) EPA's Section 304(a) Criteria for Priority Toxic Pollutants.

    Footnotes:

    a. Criteria revised to reflect current agency q<INF>1* or RfD, as 
contained in the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS). The fish 
tissue bioconcentration factor (BCF) from the 1980 criteria documents 
was retained in all cases.
    b. The criteria refers to the inorganic form only.
    c. Criteria in the matrix based on carcinogenicity (10<SUP>-\6\ 
risk). For a risk level of 10<SUP>-\5\, move the decimal point in the 
matrix value one place to the right.
    d. Criteria Maximum Concentration (CMC) = the highest concentration 
of a pollutant to which aquatic life can be exposed for a short period 
of time (1-hour average) without deleterious effects. Criteria 
Continuous Concentration (CCC) = the highest concentration of a 
pollutant to which aquatic life can be exposed for an extended period of 
time (4 days) without deleterious effects. ug/L = micrograms per liter
    e. Freshwater aquatic life criteria for these metals are expressed 
as a function of total hardness (mg/L as CaC0<INF>3), the pollutant's 
water effect ratio (WER) as defined in Sec. 131.36(c) and multiplied by 
an appropriate dissolved conversion factor as defined in 
Sec. 131.36(b)(2). For comparative purposes, the values displayed in 
this matrix are shown as dissolved metal and correspond to a total 
hardness of 100 mg/L and a water effect ratio of 1.0.
    f. Freshwater aquatic life criteria for pentachlorophenol are 
expressed as a function of pH, and are calculated as follows. Values 
displayed above in the matrix correspond to a pH of 7.8.

CMC = exp(1.005(pH) - 4.830)  CCC = exp(1.005(pH) - 5.290)

    g. Aquatic life criteria for these compounds were issued in 1980 
utilizing the 1980 Guidelines for criteria development. The acute values 
shown are final acute values (FAV) which by the 1980 Guidelines are 
instantaneous values as contrasted with a CMC which is a one-hour 
average.
    h. These totals simply sum the criteria in each column. For aquatic 
life, there are 30 priority toxic pollutants with some type of 
freshwater or saltwater, acute or chronic criteria. For human health, 
there are 91 priority toxic pollutants with either ``water + fish'' or 
``fish only'' criteria. Note that these totals count chromium as one 
pollutant even though EPA has developed criteria based on two valence 
states. In the matrix, EPA has assigned numbers 5a and 5b to the 
criteria for chromium to reflect the fact that the list of 126 priority 
toxic pollutants includes only a single listing for chromium.
    i. If the CCC for total mercury exceeds 0.012 ug/L more than once in 
a 3-year period in the ambient water, the edible portion of aquatic 
species of concern must be analyzed to determine whether the 
concentration of methyl mercury exceeds the FDA action level (1.0 mg/
kg). If the FDA action level is exceeded, the State must notify the 
appropriate EPA Regional Administrator, initiate a revision of its 
mercury criterion in its water quality standards so as to protect 
designated uses, and take other appropriate action such as issuance of a 
fish consumption advisory for the affected area.
    j. No criteria for protection of human health from consumption of 
aquatic organisms (excluding water) was presented in the 1980 criteria 
document or in the 1986 Quality Criteria for Water. Nevertheless, 
sufficient information was presented in the 1980 document to allow a 
calculation of a criterion, even though the results of such a 
calculation were not shown in the document.
    k. The criterion for asbestos is the MCL (56 FR 3526, January 30, 
1991).
    l. [Reserved: this letter not used as a footnote].
    m. Criteria for these metals are expressed as a function of the 
water effect ratio, WER, as defined in 40 CFR 131.36(c).

CMC = column B1 or C1 value  x  WER
CCC = column B2 or C2 value  x  WER

    n. EPA is not promulgating human health criteria for this 
contaminant. However, permit authorities should address this contaminant 
in NPDES permit actions using the State's existing narrative criteria 
for toxics.
    o. [Reserved: This letter not used as a footnote].
    p. Criterion expressed as total recoverable.

    General Notes:

    1. This chart lists all of EPA's priority toxic pollutants whether 
or not criteria recommendations are available. Blank spaces indicate the 
absence of criteria recommendations. Because of variations in chemical 
nomenclature systems, this listing of toxic pollutants does not 
duplicate the listing in Appendix A of 40 CFR Part 423. EPA has added 
the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) registry numbers, which provide a 
unique identification for each chemical.
    2. The following chemicals have organoleptic based criteria 
recommendations that are not included on this chart (for reasons which 
are discussed in the preamble): copper, zinc, chlorobenzene, 2-
chlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol, acenaphthene, 2,4-dimethylphenol, 3-
methyl-4-chlorophenol, hexachlorocyclopentadiene, pentachlorophenol, 
phenol
    3. For purposes of this rulemaking, freshwater criteria and 
saltwater criteria apply as specified in 40 CFR 131.36(c).

    Note to paragraph (b)(1): On April 14, 1995, the Environmental 
Protection Agency issued a stay of certain criteria in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section as follows: the criteria in columns B and C for arsenic, 
cadmium, chromium (VI), copper, lead, nickel, silver, and

[[Page 626]]

zinc; the criteria in B1 and C1 for mercury; the criteria in column B 
for chromium (III); and the criteria in column C for selenium. The stay 
remains in effect until further notice.

    (2) Factors for Calculating Hardness-Dependent, Freshwater Metals 
Criteria

CMC=WER exp {m<INF>A[ln(hardness)]+b<INF>A} x Acute Conversion Factor
CCC=WER exp {m<INF>C[ln(hardness)]+b<INF>C} x Chronic Conversion Factor
Final CMC and CCC values should be rounded to two significant figures.

    (c) Applicability. (1) The criteria in paragraph (b) of this section 
apply to the States' designated uses cited in paragraph (d) of this 
section and supersede any criteria adopted by the State, except when 
State regulations contain criteria which are more stringent for a 
particular use in which case the State's criteria will continue to 
apply.
    (2) The criteria established in this section are subject to the 
State's general rules of applicability in the same way and to the same 
extent as are the other numeric toxics criteria when applied to the same 
use classifications including mixing zones, and low flow values below 
which numeric standards can be exceeded in flowing fresh waters.
    (i) For all waters with mixing zone regulations or implementation 
procedures, the criteria apply at the appropriate locations within or at 
the boundary of the mixing zones; otherwise the criteria apply 
throughout the waterbody including at the end of any discharge pipe, 
canal or other discharge point.
    (ii) A State shall not use a low flow value below which numeric 
standards can be exceeded that is less stringent than the following for 
waters suitable for the establishment of low flow return frequencies 
(i.e., streams and rivers):


                                                                        
                              Aquatic Life                              
                                                                        
Acute criteria (CMC)                 1 Q 10 or 1 B 3                    
Chronic criteria (CCC)               7 Q 10 or 4 B 3                    
                                                                        
                              Human Health                              
                                                                        
Non-carcinogens                      30 Q 5                             
Carcinogens                          Harmonic mean flow                 
                                                                        

Where:

    CMC--criteria maximum concentration--the water quality criteria to 
protect against acute effects in aquatic life and is the highest 
instream concentration of a priority toxic pollutant consisting of a 
one-hour average not to be exceeded more than once every three years on 
the average;
    CCC--criteria continuous concentration--the water quality criteria 
to protect against chronic effects in aquatic life is the highest 
instream concentration of a priority toxic pollutant consisting of a 4-
day average not to be exceeded more than once every three years on the 
average;
    1 Q 10 is the lowest one day flow with an average recurrence 
frequency of once in 10 years determined hydrologically;
    1 B 3 is biologically based and indicates an allowable exceedence of 
once every 3 years. It is determined by EPA's computerized method (DFLOW 
model);

[[Page 627]]

    7 Q 10 is the lowest average 7 consecutive day low flow with an 
average recurrence frequency of once in 10 years determined 
hydrologically;
    4 B 3 is biologically based and indicates an allowable exceedence 
for 4 consecutive days once every 3 years. It is determined by EPA's 
computerized method (DFLOW model);
    30 Q 5 is the lowest average 30 consecutive day low flow with an 
average recurrence frequency of once in 5 years determined 
hydrologically; and the harmonic mean flow is a long term mean flow 
value calculated by dividing the number of daily flows analyzed by the 
sum of the reciprocals of those daily flows.

    (iii) If a State does not have such a low flow value for numeric 
standards compliance, then none shall apply and the criteria included in 
paragraph (d) of this section herein apply at all flows.
    (3) The aquatic life criteria in the matrix in paragraph (b) of this 
section apply as follows:
    (i) For waters in which the salinity is equal to or less than 1 part 
per thousand 95% or more of the time, the applicable criteria are the 
freshwater criteria in Column B;
    (ii) For waters in which the salinity is equal to or greater than 10 
parts per thousand 95% or more of the time, the applicable criteria are 
the saltwater criteria in Column C; and
    (iii) For waters in which the salinity is between 1 and 10 parts per 
thousand as defined in paragraphs (c)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section, 
the applicable criteria are the more stringent of the freshwater or 
saltwater criteria. However, the Regional Administrator may approve the 
use of the alternative freshwater or saltwater criteria if 
scientifically defensible information and data demonstrate that on a 
site-specific basis the biology of the waterbody is dominated by 
freshwater aquatic life and that freshwater criteria are more 
appropriate; or conversely, the biology of the waterbody is dominated by 
saltwater aquatic life and that saltwater criteria are more appropriate.
    (4) Application of metals criteria. (i) For purposes of calculating 
freshwater aquatic life criteria for metals from the equations in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the minimum hardness allowed for use 
in those equations shall not be less than 25 mg/l, as calcium carbonate, 
even if the actual ambient hardness is less than 25 mg/l as calcium 
carbonate. The maximum hardness value for use in those equations shall 
not exceed 400 mg/l as calcium carbonate, even if the actual ambient 
hardness is greater than 400 mg/l as calcium carbonate. The same 
provisions apply for calculating the metals criteria for the comparisons 
provided for in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (ii) The hardness values used shall be consistent with the design 
discharge conditions established in paragraph (c)(2) of this section for 
flows and mixing zones.
    (iii) Except where otherwise noted, the criteria for metals 
(compounds #2, #4-# 11, and #13, in paragraph (b) of this section) are 
expressed as dissolved metal. For purposes of calculating aquatic life 
criteria for metals from the equations in footnote m. in the criteria 
matrix in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the equations in 
paragraphs (b)(2) of this section, the water-effect ratio is computed as 
a specific pollutant's acute or chronic toxicity values measured in 
water from the site covered by the standard, divided by the respective 
acute or chronic toxicity value in laboratory dilution water.

    (10) California, EPA Region 9.
    (i) All waters assigned any aquatic life or human health use 
classifications in the Water Quality Control Plans for the various 
Basins of the State (``Basin Plans''), as amended, adopted by the 
California State Water Resources Control Board (``SWRCB''), except for 
ocean waters covered by the Water Quality Control Plan for Ocean Waters 
of California (``Ocean Plan'') adopted by the SWRCB with resolution 
Number 90-27 on March 22, 1990, are subject to the criteria in paragraph 
(d)(10)(ii) of this section, without exception. These

[[Page 632]]

criteria amend the portions of the existing State standards contained in 
the Basin Plans. More particularly these criteria amend water quality 
criteria contained in the Basin Plan Chapters specifying water quality 
objectives (the State equivalent of federal water quality criteria) for 
the toxic pollutants identified in paragraph (d)(10)(ii) of this 
section. Although the State has adopted several use designations for 
each of these waters, for purposes of this action, the specific 
standards to be applied in paragraph (d)(10)(ii) of this section are 
based on the presence in all waters of some aquatic life designation and 
the presence or absence of the MUN use designation (Municipal and 
domestic supply). (See Basin Plans for more detailed use definitions.)
    (ii) The following criteria from the matrix in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section apply to the water and use classifications defined in 
paragraph (d)(10)(i) of this section and identified below:

Sec. 131.37  California.

    (a) Additional criteria. The following criteria are applicable to 
waters specified in the Water Quality Control Plan for Salinity for the 
San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary, adopted by the 
California State Water Resources Control Board in State Board Resolution 
No. 91-34 on May 1, 1991:
    (1) Estuarine habitat criteria. (i) General rule. (A) Salinity 
(measured at the surface) shall not exceed 2640 micromhos/centimeter 
specific conductance at 25  deg.C (measured as a 14-day moving average) 
at the Confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers throughout 
the period each year from February 1 through June 30, and shall not 
exceed 2640 micromhos/centimeter specific conductance at 25  deg.C 
(measured as a 14-day moving average) at the specific locations noted in 
Table 1 near Roe Island and Chipps Island for the number of days each 
month in the February 1 to June 30 period computed by reference to the 
following formula:

Number of days required in Month X = Total number of days in Month X * 
(1-1/(1+e<SUP>K)
where K = A + (B*natural logarithm of the previous month's 8-River 
Index);
A and B are determined by reference to Table 1 for the Roe Island and 
Chipps Island locations;
x is the calendar month in the February 1 to June 30 period;
and e is the base of the natural (or Napierian) logarithm.

Where the number of days computed in this equation in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i)(A) of this section shall be rounded to the nearest whole 
number of days. When the previous month's 8-River Index is less than 
500,000 acre-feet, the number of days required for the current month 
shall be zero.

\1\ Coefficients for A and B are not provided at Chipps Island for February, because the 2640 micromhos/cm      
  specific conductance criteria must be maintained at Chipps Island throughout February under all historical 8- 
  River Index values for January.                                                                               

    (B) The Roe Island criteria apply at the salinity measuring station 
maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation at Port Chicago (km 64). 
The Chipps Island criteria apply at the Mallard Slough Monitoring Site, 
Station D-10 (RKI RSAC-075) maintained by the California Department of 
Water Resources. The Confluence criteria apply at the Collinsville 
Continuous Monitoring Station C-2 (RKI RSAC-081) maintained by the 
California Department of Water Resources.
    (ii) Exception. The criteria at Roe Island shall be required for any 
given month only if the 14-day moving average salinity at Roe Island 
falls below 2640 micromhos/centimeter specific conductance on any of the 
last 14 days of the previous month.
    (2) Fish migration criteria. (i) General rule.
    (A) Sacramento River. Measured Fish Migration criteria values for 
the Sacramento River shall be at least the following:

At temperatures less than below 61 deg.F: SRFMC = 1.35
At temperatures between 61 deg.F and 72  deg.F: SRFMC = 6.96-.092 * 
Fahrenheit temperature
At temperatures greater than 72  deg.F: SRFMC = 0.34

where SRFMC is the Sacramento River Fish Migration criteria value. 
Temperature shall be the water temperature at release of tagged salmon 
smolts into the Sacramento River at Miller Park.
    (B) San Joaquin River. Measured Fish Migration criteria values on 
the San Joaquin River shall be at least the following:

For years in which the SJVIndex is > 2.5: SJFMC = (-0.012) + 
0.184*SJVIndex
In other years: SJFMC = 0.205 + 0.0975*SJVIndex

where SJFMC is the San Joaquin River Fish Migration criteria value, and 
SJVIndex is the San Joaquin Valley Index in million acre feet (MAF)
    (ii) Computing fish migration criteria values for Sacramento River. 
In order to assess fish migration criteria values for the Sacramento 
River, tagged fall-run salmon smolts will be released into the 
Sacramento River at Miller Park and captured at Chipps Island, or 
alternatively released at Miller Park and Port Chicago and recovered 
from the ocean fishery, using the methodology described in this 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii). An alternative methodology for computing fish 
migration criteria values can be used so long as the revised methodology 
is calibrated with the methodology described in this paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii) so as to maintain the validity of the relative index values. 
Sufficient releases shall be made each year to provide a statistically 
reliable verification of compliance with the criteria. These criteria 
will be considered attained when the sum of the differences between the 
measured experimental value and the stated criteria value (i.e., 
measured value minus stated value) for each experimental release 
conducted over a three year period (the current year and the previous 
two years) shall be greater than or equal to zero. Fish for release are 
to be tagged at the hatchery with coded-wire tags, and fin clipped. 
Approximately 50,000 to 100,000 fish of smolt size (size greater than 75 
mm) are released for each survival index estimate, depending on expected 
mortality. As a control for the

[[Page 638]]

ocean recovery survival index, one or two groups per season are released 
at Benecia or Pt. Chicago. From each upstream release of tagged fish, 
fish are to be caught over a period of one to two weeks at Chipps 
Island. Daylight sampling at Chipps Island with a 9.1 by 7.9 m, 3.2 mm 
cod end, midwater trawl is begun 2 to 3 days after release. When the 
first fish is caught, full-time trawling 7 days a week should begin. 
Each day's trawling consists of ten 20 minute tows generally made 
against the current, and distributed equally across the channel.
    (A) The Chipps Island smolt survival index is calculated as:

SSI=R<divide>MT(0.007692)

where R=number of recaptures of tagged fish
M=number of marked (tagged) fish released
T=proportion of time sampled vs total time tagged fish were passing the 
site (i.e. time between first and last tagged fish recovery)

Where the value 0.007692 is the proportion of the channel width fished 
by the trawl, and is calculated as trawl width/channel width.
    (B) Recoveries of tagged fish from the ocean salmon fishery two to 
four years after release are also used to calculate a survival index for 
each release. Smolt survival indices from ocean recoveries are 
calculated as:

OSI=R<INF>1/M<INF>1<divide>R<INF>2/M<INF>2

where R<INF>1=number of tagged adults recovered from the upstream 
release
M<INF>1=number released upstream
R<INF>2=number of tagged adults recovered from the Port Chicago release
M<INF>2=number released at Port Chicago

    (1) The number of tagged adults recovered from the ocean fishery is 
provided by the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, which 
maintains a port sampling program.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (iii) Computing fish migration criteria values for San Joaquin 
River. In order to assess annual fish migration criteria values for the 
San Joaquin River, tagged salmon smolts will be released into the San 
Joaquin River at Mossdale and captured at Chipps Island, or 
alternatively released at Mossdale and Port Chicago and recovered from 
the ocean fishery, using the methodology described in paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii). An alternative methodology for computing fish migration 
criteria values can be used so long as the revised methodology is 
calibrated with the methodology described below so as to maintain the 
validity of the relative index values. Sufficient releases shall be made 
each year to provide a statistically reliable estimate of the SJFMC for 
the year. These criteria will be considered attained when the sum of the 
differences between the measured experimental value and the stated 
criteria value (i.e., measured value minus stated value) for each 
experimental release conducted over a three year period (the current 
year and the previous two years) shall be greater than or equal to zero.
    (A) Fish for release are to be tagged at the hatchery with coded-
wire tags, and fin clipped. Approximately 50,000 to 100,000 fish of 
smolt size (size greater than 75 mm) are released for each survival 
index estimate, depending on expected mortality. As a control for the 
ocean recovery survival index, one or two groups per season are released 
at Benicia or Pt. Chicago. From each upstream release of tagged fish, 
fish are to be caught over a period of one to two weeks at Chipps 
Island. Daylight sampling at Chipps Island with a 9.1 by 7.9 m, 3.2 mm 
cod end, midwater trawl is begun 2 to 3 days after release. When the 
first fish is caught, full-time trawling 7 days a week should begin. 
Each day's trawling consists of ten 20 minute tows generally made 
against the current, and distributed equally across the channel.
    (B) The Chipps Island smolt survival index is calculated as:

SSI=R<divide>MT(0.007692)

where R=number of recaptures of tagged fish
M=number of marked (tagged) fish released
T=proportion of time sampled vs total time tagged fish were passing the 
site (i.e. time between first and last tagged fish recovery)

Where the value 0.007692 is the proportion of the channel width fished 
by the trawl, and is calculated as trawl width/channel width.
    (C) Recoveries of tagged fish from the ocean salmon fishery two to 
four years

[[Page 639]]

after release are also used to calculate a survival index for each 
release. Smolt survival indices from ocean recoveries are calculated as:

OSI=R<INF>1/M<INF>1 <divide> R<INF>2/M<INF>2
where R<INF>1=number of tagged adults recovered from the upstream 
release
M<INF>1=number released upstream
R<INF>2=number of tagged adults recovered from the Port Chicago release
M<INF>2=number released at Port Chicago

    (1) The number of tagged adults recovered from the ocean fishery is 
provided by the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, which 
maintains a port sampling program.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (3) Suisun marsh criteria. (i) Water quality conditions sufficient 
to support a natural gradient in species composition and wildlife 
habitat characteristic of a brackish marsh throughout all elevations of 
the tidal marshes bordering Suisun Bay shall be maintained. Water 
quality conditions shall be maintained so that none of the following 
occurs: Loss of diversity; conversion of brackish marsh to salt marsh; 
for animals, decreased population abundance of those species vulnerable 
to increased mortality and loss of habitat from increased water 
salinity; or for plants, significant reduction in stature or percent 
cover from increased water or soil salinity or other water quality 
parameters.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (b) Revised criteria. The following criteria are applicable to state 
waters specified in Table 1-1, at Section (C)(3) (``Striped Bass--
Salinity : 3. Prisoners Point--Spawning) of the Water Quality Control 
Plan for Salinity for the San Francisco Bay--Sacramento/San Joaquin 
Delta Estuary, adopted by the California State Water Resources Control 
Board in State Board Resolution No. 91-34 on May 1, 1991:

    (c) Definitions. Terms used in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section, shall be defined as follows:
    (1) Water year. A water year is the twelve calendar months beginning 
October 1.

[[Page 640]]

    (2) 8-River Index. The flow determinations are made and are 
published by the California Department of Water Resources in Bulletin 
120. The 8-River Index shall be computed as the sum of flows at the 
following stations:
    (i) Sacramento River at Band Bridge, near Red Bluff;
    (ii) Feather River, total inflow to Oroville Reservoir;
    (iii) Yuba River at Smartville;
    (iv) American River, total inflow to Folsom Reservoir;
    (v) Stanislaus River, total inflow to New Melones Reservoir;
    (vi) Tuolumne River, total inflow to Don Pedro Reservoir;
    (vii) Merced River, total inflow to Exchequer Reservoir; and

    (3) San Joaquin Valley Index. (i) The San Joaquin Valley Index is 
computed according to the following formula:

I<INF>SJ=0.6X+0.2Y and 0.2Z
where I<INF>SJ=San Joaquin Valley Index
X=Current year's April-July San Joaquin Valley unimpaired runoff
Y=Current year's October-March San Joaquin Valley unimpaired runoff
Z=Previous year's index in MAF, not to exceed 0.9 MAF

    (ii) Measuring San Joaquin Valley unimpaired runoff. San Joaquin 
Valley unimpaired runoff for the current water year is a forecast of the 
sum of the following locations: Stanislaus River, total flow to New 
Melones Reservoir; Tuolumne River, total inflow to Don Pedro Reservoir; 
Merced River, total flow to Exchequer Reservoir; San Joaquin River, 
total inflow to Millerton Lake.
    (4) Salinity. Salinity is the total concentration of dissolved ions 
in water. It shall be measured by specific conductance in accordance 
with the procedures set forth in 40 CFR 136.3, Table 1B, Parameter 64.

Sec. 132.1  Scope, purpose, and availability of documents.

    (a) This part constitutes the Water Quality Guidance for the Great 
Lakes System (Guidance) required by section 118(c)(2) of the Clean Water 
Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) as amended by the Great Lakes Critical 
Programs Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-596, 104 Stat. 3000 et seq.). The 
Guidance in this part identifies minimum water quality standards, 
antidegradation policies, and implementation procedures for the Great

[[Page 641]]

Lakes System to protect human health, aquatic life, and wildlife.
    (b) The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Great Lakes States, 
and Great Lakes Tribes will use the Guidance in this part to evaluate 
the water quality programs of the States and Tribes to assure that they 
are protective of water quality. State and Tribal programs do not need 
to be identical to the Guidance in this part, but must contain 
provisions that are consistent with (as protective as) the Guidance in 
this part. The scientific, policy and legal basis for EPA's development 
of each section of the final Guidance in this part is set forth in the 
preamble, Supplementary Information Document, Technical Support 
Documents, and other supporting documents in the public docket. EPA will 
follow the guidance set out in these documents in reviewing the State 
and Tribal water quality programs in the Great Lakes for consistency 
with this part.
    (c) The Great Lakes States and Tribes must adopt provisions 
consistent with the Guidance in this part applicable to waters in the 
Great Lakes System or be subject to EPA promulgation of its terms 
pursuant to this part.
    (d) EPA understands that the science of risk assessment is rapidly 
improving. Therefore, to ensure that the scientific basis for the 
methodologies in appendices A through D are always current and peer 
reviewed, EPA will review the methodologies and revise them, as 
appropriate, every 3 years.
    (e) Certain documents referenced in the appendixes to this part with 
a designation of NTIS and/or ERIC are available for a fee upon request 
to the National Technical Information Center (NTIS), U.S. Department of 
Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. Alternatively,

Sec. 132.2  Definitions.

    The following definitions apply in this part. Terms not defined in 
this section have the meaning given by the Clean Water Act and EPA 
implementing regulations.
    Acute-chronic ratio (ACR) is a standard measure of the acute 
toxicity of a material divided by an appropriate measure of the chronic 
toxicity of the same material under comparable conditions.
    Acute toxicity is concurrent and delayed adverse effect(s) that 
results from an acute exposure and occurs within any short observation 
period which begins when the exposure begins, may extend beyond the 
exposure period, and usually does not constitute a substantial portion 
of the life span of the organism.
    Adverse effect is any deleterious effect to organisms due to 
exposure to a substance. This includes effects which are or may become 
debilitating, harmful or toxic to the normal functions of the organism, 
but does not include non-harmful effects such as tissue discoloration 
alone or the induction of enzymes involved in the metabolism of the 
substance.
    Bioaccumulation is the net accumulation of a substance by an 
organism as a result of uptake from all environmental sources.
    Bioaccumulation factor (BAF) is the ratio (in L/kg) of a substance's 
concentration in tissue of an aquatic organism to its concentration in 
the ambient water, in situations where both the organism and its food 
are exposed and the ratio does not change substantially over time.
    Bioaccumulative chemical of concern (BCC) is any chemical that has 
the potential to cause adverse effects which, upon entering the surface 
waters, by itself or as its toxic transformation product, accumulates in 
aquatic organisms by a human health bioaccumulation factor greater than 
1000, after considering metabolism and other physicochemical properties 
that might enhance or inhibit bioaccumulation, in accordance with the 
methodology in appendix B of this part. Chemicals with half-lives of 
less than eight weeks in the water column, sediment, and biota are not 
BCCs. The minimum BAF information needed to define an organic chemical 
as a BCC is either a field-measured BAF or a BAF derived using

[[Page 642]]

the BSAF methodology. The minimum BAF information needed to define an 
inorganic chemical, including an organometal, as a BCC is either a 
field-measured BAF or a laboratory-measured BCF. BCCs include, but are 
not limited to, the pollutants identified as BCCs in section A of Table 
6 of this part.
    Bioconcentration is the net accumulation of a substance by an 
aquatic organism as a result of uptake directly from the ambient water 
through gill membranes or other external body surfaces.
    Bioconcentration factor (BCF) is the ratio (in L/kg) of a 
substance's concentration in tissue of an aquatic organism to its 
concentration in the ambient water, in situations where the organism is 
exposed through the water only and the ratio does not change 
substantially over time.
    Biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) is the ratio (in kg of 
organic carbon/kg of lipid) of a substance's lipid-normalized 
concentration in tissue of an aquatic organism to its organic carbon-
normalized concentration in surface sediment, in situations where the 
ratio does not change substantially over time, both the organism and its 
food are exposed, and the surface sediment is representative of average 
surface sediment in the vicinity of the organism.
    Carcinogen is a substance which causes an increased incidence of 
benign or malignant neoplasms, or substantially decreases the time to 
develop neoplasms, in animals or humans. The classification of

the absence of a TMDL approved by EPA pursuant to 40 CFR 130.7 or an 
assessment and remediation plan developed and approved in accordance 
with procedure 3.A of appendix F of this part, a WLA is the allocation 
for an individual point source, that ensures that the level of water 
quality to be achieved by the point source is derived from and complies 
with all applicable water quality standards.
    Wet weather point source means any discernible, confined and 
discrete conveyance from which pollutants are, or may be, discharged as 
the result of a wet weather event. Discharges from wet weather point 
sources shall include only: discharges of storm water from a municipal 
separate storm sewer as defined at 40 CFR 122.26(b)(8); storm water

(domestic, commercial, and industrial) from a combined sewer overflow; 
or any other stormwater discharge for which a permit is required under 
section 402(p) of the Clean Water Act. A storm water discharge 
associated with industrial activity which is mixed with process 
wastewater shall not be considered a wet weather point source.

the criteria, methodologies, policies and procedures are consistent with 
the requirements of the Clean Water Act and this part, as well as 
information on general policies which may affect their application and 
implementation.
    (c) The Regional Administrator may extend the deadline for the 
submission required in paragraph (a) of this section if the Regional 
Administrator believes that the submission will be consistent with the 
requirements of this part and can be reviewed and approved pursuant to 
this section no later than March 23, 1997.
    (d) If a Great Lakes State or Tribe makes no submission pursuant to 
this part to EPA for review, the requirements of this part shall apply 
to discharges to waters of the Great Lakes System located within the 
State or Federal Indian reservation upon EPA's publication of a final 
rule indicating the effective date of the part 132 requirements in the 
identified jurisdictions.
    (e) If a Great Lakes State or Tribe submits criteria, methodologies, 
policies, and procedures pursuant to this part to EPA for review that 
contain substantial modifications of the State or Tribal NPDES program, 
EPA shall issue public notice and provide a minimum of 30 days for 
public comment on such modifications. The public notice shall conform 
with the requirements of 40 CFR 123.62.
    (f) After review of State or Tribal submissions under this section, 
and following the public comment period in subparagraph (e) of this 
section, if any, EPA shall either:
    (1) Publish notice of approval of the submission in the Federal 
Register within 90 days of such submission; or
    (2) Notify the State or Tribe within 90 days of such submission that 
EPA has determined that all or part of the submission is inconsistent 
with the requirements of the Clean Water Act or this part and identify 
any necessary changes to obtain EPA approval. If the State or Tribe 
fails to adopt such changes within 90 days after the notification, EPA 
shall publish a notice in the Federal Register identifying the approved 
and disapproved elements of the submission and a final rule in the 
Federal Register identifying the provisions of part 132 that shall apply 
to discharges within the State or Federal Indian reservation.

[[Page 648]]

    (g) EPA's approval or disapproval of a State or Tribal submission 
shall be based on the requirements of this part and of the Clean Water 
Act. EPA's determination whether the criteria, methodologies, policies, 
and procedures in a State or Tribal submission are consistent with the 
requirements of this part will be based on whether:
    (1) For pollutants listed in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this part. The 
Great Lakes State or Tribe has adopted numeric water quality criteria as 
protective as each of the numeric criteria in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 of 
this part, taking into account any site-specific criteria modifications 
in accordance with procedure 1 of appendix F of this part;
    (2) For pollutants other than those listed in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, and 
5 of this part. The Great Lakes State or Tribe demonstrates that either:
    (i) It has adopted numeric criteria in its water quality standards 
that were derived, or are as protective as or more protective than could 
be derived, using the methodologies in appendixes A, B, C, and D of this 
part, and the site-specific criteria modification procedures in 
accordance with procedure 1 of appendix F of this part; or
    (ii) It has adopted a procedure by which water quality-based 
effluent limits and total maximum daily loads are developed using the 
more protective of:
    (A) Numeric criteria adopted by the State into State water quality 
standards and approved by EPA prior to March 23, 1997; or
    (B) Water quality criteria and values derived pursuant to 
Sec. 132.4(c); and
    (3) For methodologies, policies, and procedures. The Great Lakes 
State or Tribe has adopted methodologies, policies, and procedures as 
protective as the corresponding methodology, policy, or procedure in 
Sec. 132.4. The Great Lakes State or Tribe may adopt provisions that are 
more protective than those contained in this part. Adoption of a more 
protective element in one provision may be used to offset a less 
protective element in the same provision as long as the adopted 
provision is as protective as the corresponding provision in this part; 
adoption of a more protective element in one provision, however, is not 
justification for adoption of a less protective element in another 
provision of this part.
    (h) A submission by a Great Lakes State or Tribe will need to 
include any provisions that EPA determines, based on EPA's authorities 
under the Clean Water Act and the results of consultation under section 
7 of the Endangered Species Act, are necessary to ensure that water 
quality is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any 
endangered or threatened species listed under section 4 of the 
Endangered Species Act or result in the destruction or adverse 
modification of such species' critical habitat.
    (i) EPA's approval of the elements of a State's or Tribe's 
submission will constitute approval under section 118 of the Clean Water 
Act, approval of the submitted water quality standards pursuant to 
section 303 of the Clean Water Act, and approval of the submitted 
modifications to the State's or Tribe's NPDES program pursuant to 
section 402 of the Clean Water Act.

      Appendix A to part 132--Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative 
   Methodologies for Developments of Aquatic Life Criteria and Values

         Methodology for Deriving Aquatic Life Criteria: Tier I

    Great Lakes States and Tribes shall adopt provisions consistent with 
(as protective as) this appendix.

                             I. Definitions

    A. Material of Concern. When defining the material of concern the 
following should be considered:
    1. Each separate chemical that does not ionize substantially in most 
natural bodies of water should usually be considered a separate 
material, except possibly for structurally similar organic compounds 
that only exist in large quantities as commercial mixtures of the 
various compounds and apparently have similar biological, chemical, 
physical, and toxicological properties.
    2. For chemicals that ionize substantially in most natural bodies of 
water (e.g., some phenols and organic acids, some salts of phenols and 
organic acids, and most inorganic salts and coordination complexes of 
metals and metalloid), all forms that would be in chemical equilibrium 
should usually be considered one material. Each different oxidation 
state of a metal and each different non-ionizable covalently bonded 
organometallic compound should usually be considered a separate 
material.
    3. The definition of the material of concern should include an 
operational analytical component. Identification of a material simply as 
``sodium,'' for example, implies ``total sodium,'' but leaves room for 
doubt. If ``total'' is meant, it must be explicitly stated. Even 
``total'' has different operational definitions, some of which do not 
necessarily measure ``all that is there'' in all samples. Thus, it is 
also necessary to reference or describe the analytical method that is 
intended. The selection of the operational analytical component should 
take into account the analytical and environmental chemistry of the 
material and various practical considerations, such as labor and 
equipment requirements, and whether the method would require measurement 
in the field or would allow measurement after samples are transported to 
a laboratory.
    a. The primary requirements of the operational analytical component 
are that it be appropriate for use on samples of receiving water, that 
it be compatible with the available toxicity and bioaccumulation data 
without making extrapolations that are too hypothetical, and that it 
rarely result in underprotection or overprotection of aquatic organisms 
and their uses. Toxicity is the property of a material, or combination 
of materials, to adversely affect organisms.
    b. Because an ideal analytical measurement will rarely be available, 
an appropriate compromise measurement will usually have to be used. This 
compromise measurement must fit with the general approach that if an 
ambient concentration is lower than the criterion, unacceptable effects 
will probably not occur, i.e., the compromise measure must not err on 
the side of underprotection when measurements are made on a surface 
water. What is an appropriate measurement in one situation might not be 
appropriate for another. For example, because the chemical and physical 
properties of an effluent are usually quite different from those of the 
receiving water, an analytical method that is appropriate for analyzing 
an effluent might not be appropriate for expressing a criterion,

[[Page 652]]

and vice versa. A criterion should be based on an appropriate analytical 
measurement, but the criterion is not rendered useless if an ideal 
measurement either is not available or is not feasible.
    Note: The analytical chemistry of the material might have to be 
taken into account when defining the material or when judging the 
acceptability of some toxicity tests, but a criterion must not be based 
on the sensitivity of an analytical method. When aquatic organisms are 
more sensitive than routine analytical methods, the proper solution is 
to develop better analytical methods.
    4. It is now the policy of EPA that the use of dissolved metal to 
set and measure compliance with water quality standards is the 
recommended approach, because dissolved metal more closely approximates 
the bioavailable fraction of metal in the water column that does total 
recoverable metal. One reason is that a primary mechanism for water 
column toxicity is adsorption at the gill surface which requires metals 
to be in the dissolved form. Reasons for the consideration of total 
recoverable metals criteria include risk management considerations not 
covered by evaluation of water column toxicity. A risk manager may 
consider sediments and food chain effects and may decide to take a 
conservative approach for metals, considering that metals are very 
persistent chemicals. This approach could include the use of total 
recoverable metal in water quality standards. A range of different risk 
management decisions can be justified. EPA recommends that State water 
quality standards be based on dissolved metal. EPA will also approve a 
State risk management decision to adopt standards based on total 
recoverable metal, if those standards are otherwise approvable under 
this program.
    B. Acute Toxicity. Concurrent and delayed adverse effect(s) that 
results from an acute exposure and occurs within any short observation 
period which begins when the exposure begins, may extend beyond the 
exposure period, and usually does not constitute a substantial portion 
of the life span of the organism. (Concurrent toxicity is an adverse 
effect to an organism that results from, and occurs during, its exposure 
to one or more test materials.) Exposure constitutes contact with a 
chemical or physical agent. Acute exposure, however, is exposure of an 
organism for any short period which usually does not constitute a 
substantial portion of its life span.
    C. Chronic Toxicity. Concurrent and delayed adverse effect(s) that 
occurs only as a result of a chronic exposure. Chronic exposure is 
exposure of an organism for any long period or for a substantial portion 
of its life span.

                         II. Collection of Data

    A. Collect all data available on the material concerning toxicity to 
aquatic animals and plants.
    B. All data that are used should be available in typed, dated, and 
signed hard copy (e.g., publication, manuscript, letter, memorandum, 
etc.) with enough supporting information to indicate that acceptable 
test procedures were used and that the results are reliable. In some 
cases, it might be appropriate to obtain written information from the 
investigator, if possible. Information that is not available for 
distribution shall not be used.
    C. Questionable data, whether published or unpublished, must not be 
used. For example, data must be rejected if they are from tests that did 
not contain a control treatment, tests in which too many organisms in 
the control treatment died or showed signs of stress or disease, and 
tests in which distilled or deionized water was used as the dilution 
water without the addition of appropriate salts.
    D. Data on technical grade materials may be used if appropriate, but 
data on formulated mixtures and emulsifiable concentrates of the 
material must not be used.
    E. For some highly volatile, hydrolyzable, or degradable materials, 
it might be appropriate to use only results of flow-through tests in 
which the concentrations of test material in test solutions were 
measured using acceptable analytical methods. A flow-through test is a 
test with aquatic organisms in which test solutions flow into constant-
volume test chambers either intermittently (e.g., every few minutes) or 
continuously, with the excess flowing out.
    F. Data must be rejected if obtained using:
    1. Brine shrimp, because they usually only occur naturally in water 
with salinity greater than 35 g/kg.
    2. Species that do not have reproducing wild populations in North 
America.
    3. Organisms that were previously exposed to substantial 
concentrations of the test material or other contaminants.
    4. Saltwater species except for use in deriving acute-chronic 
ratios. An ACR is a standard measure of the acute toxicity of a material 
divided by an appropriate measure of the chronic toxicity of the same 
material under comparable conditions.
    G. Questionable data, data on formulated mixtures and emulsifiable 
concentrates, and data obtained with species non-resident to North 
America or previously exposed organisms may be used to provide auxiliary 
information but must not be used in the derivation of criteria.

[[Page 653]]

                           III. Required Data

    A. Certain data should be available to help ensure that each of the 
major kinds of possible adverse effects receives adequate consideration. 
An adverse effect is a change in an organism that is harmful to the 
organism. Exposure means contact with a chemical or physical agent. 
Results of acute and chronic toxicity tests with representative species 
of aquatic animals are necessary so that data available for tested 
species can be considered a useful indication of the sensitivities of 
appropriate untested species. Fewer data concerning toxicity to aquatic 
plants are usually available because procedures for conducting tests 
with plants and interpreting the results of such tests are not as well 
developed.
    B. To derive a Great Lakes Tier I criterion for aquatic organisms 
and their uses, the following must be available:
    1. Results of acceptable acute (or chronic) tests (see section IV or 
VI of this appendix) with at least one species of freshwater animal in 
at least eight different families such that all of the following are 
included:
    a. The family Salmonidae in the class Osteichthyes;
    b. One other family (preferably a commercially or recreationally 
important, warmwater species) in the class Osteichthyes (e.g., bluegill, 
channel catfish);
    c. A third family in the phylum Chordata (e.g., fish, amphibian);
    d. A planktonic crustacean (e.g., a cladoceran, copepod);
    e. A benthic crustacean (e.g., ostracod, isopod, amphipod, 
crayfish);
    f. An insect (e.g., mayfly, dragonfly, damselfly, stonefly, 
caddisfly, mosquito, midge);
    g. A family in a phylum other than Arthropoda or Chordata (e.g., 
Rotifera, Annelida, Mollusca);
    h. A family in any order of insect or any phylum not already 
represented.
    2. Acute-chronic ratios (see section VI of this appendix) with at 
least one species of aquatic animal in at least three different families 
provided that of the three species:
    a. At least one is a fish;
    b. At least one is an invertebrate; and
    c. At least one species is an acutely sensitive freshwater species 
(the other two may be saltwater species).
    3. Results of at least one acceptable test with a freshwater algae 
or vascular plant is desirable but not required for criterion derivation 
(see section VIII of this appendix). If plants are among the aquatic 
organisms most sensitive to the material, results of a test with a plant 
in another phylum (division) should also be available.
    C. If all required data are available, a numerical criterion can 
usually be derived except in special cases. For example, derivation of a 
chronic criterion might not be possible if the available ACRs vary by 
more than a factor of ten with no apparent pattern. Also, if a criterion 
is to be related to a water quality characteristic (see sections V and 
VII of this appendix), more data will be required.
    D. Confidence in a criterion usually increases as the amount of 
available pertinent information increases. Thus, additional data are 
usually desirable.

                          IV. Final Acute Value

    A. Appropriate measures of the acute (short-term) toxicity of the 
material to a variety of species of aquatic animals are used to 
calculate the Final Acute Value (FAV). The calculated Final Acute Value 
is a calculated estimate of the concentration of a test material such 
that 95 percent of the genera (with which acceptable acute toxicity 
tests have been conducted on the material) have higher Genus Mean Acute 
Values (GMAVs). An acute test is a comparative study in which organisms, 
that are subjected to different treatments, are observed for a short 
period usually not constituting a substantial portion of their life 
span. However, in some cases, the Species Mean Acute Value (SMAV) of a 
commercially or recreationally important species of the Great Lakes 
System is lower than the calculated FAV, then the SMAV replaces the 
calculated FAV in order to provide protection for that important 
species.
    B. Acute toxicity tests shall be conducted using acceptable 
procedures. For good examples of acceptable procedures see American 
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard E 729, Guide for 
Conducting Acute Toxicity Tests with Fishes, Macroinvertebrates, and 
Amphibians.
    C. Except for results with saltwater annelids and mysids, results of 
acute tests during which the test organisms were fed should not be used, 
unless data indicate that the food did not affect the toxicity of the 
test material. (Note: If the minimum acute-chronic ratio data 
requirements (as described in section III.B.2 of this appendix) are not 
met with freshwater data alone, saltwater data may be used.)
    D. Results of acute tests conducted in unusual dilution water, e.g., 
dilution water in which total organic carbon or particulate matter 
exceeded five mg/L, should not be used, unless a relationship is 
developed between acute toxicity and organic carbon or particulate 
matter, or unless data show that organic carbon or particulate matter, 
etc., do not affect toxicity.
    E. Acute values must be based upon endpoints which reflect the total 
severe adverse impact of the test material on the organisms used in the 
test. Therefore, only the following kinds of data on acute toxicity to 
aquatic animals shall be used:

[[Page 654]]

    1. Tests with daphnids and other cladocerans must be started with 
organisms less than 24 hours old and tests with midges must be started 
with second or third instar larvae. It is preferred that the results 
should be the 48-hour EC50 based on the total percentage of organisms 
killed and immobilized. If such an EC50 is not available for a test, the 
48-hour LC50 should be used in place of the desired 48-hour EC50. An 
EC50 or LC50 of longer than 48 hours can be used as long as the animals 
were not fed and the control animals were acceptable at the end of the 
test. An EC50 is a statistically or graphically estimated concentration 
that is expected to cause one or more specified effects in 50% of a 
group of organisms under specified conditions. An LC50 is a 
statistically or graphically estimated concentration that is expected to 
be lethal to 50% of a group of organisms under specified conditions.
    2. It is preferred that the results of a test with embryos and 
larvae of barnacles, bivalve molluscs (clams, mussels, oysters and 
scallops), sea urchins, lobsters, crabs, shrimp and abalones be the 96-
hour EC50 based on the percentage of organisms with incompletely 
developed shells plus the percentage of organisms killed. If such an 
EC50 is not available from a test, of the values that are available from 
the test, the lowest of the following should be used in place of the 
desired 96-hour EC50: 48- to 96-hour EC50s based on percentage of 
organisms with incompletely developed shells plus percentage of 
organisms killed, 48- to 96-hour EC50s based upon percentage of 
organisms with incompletely developed shells, and 48-hour to 96-hour 
LC50s. (Note: If the minimum acute-chronic ratio data requirements (as 
described in section III.B.2 of this appendix) are not met with 
freshwater data alone, saltwater data may be used.)
    3. It is preferred that the result of tests with all other aquatic 
animal species and older life stages of barnacles, bivalve molluscs 
(clams, mussels, oysters and scallops), sea urchins, lobsters, crabs, 
shrimp and abalones be the 96-hour EC50 based on percentage of organisms 
exhibiting loss of equilibrium plus percentage of organisms immobilized 
plus percentage of organisms killed. If such an EC50 is not available 
from a test, of the values that are available from a test the lower of 
the following should be used in place of the desired 96-hour EC50: the 
96-hour EC50 based on percentage of organisms exhibiting loss of 
equilibrium plus percentage of organisms immobilized and the 96-hour 
LC50.
    4. Tests whose results take into account the number of young 
produced, such as most tests with protozoans, are not considered acute 
tests, even if the duration was 96 hours or less.
    5. If the tests were conducted properly, acute values reported as 
``greater than'' values and those which are above the solubility of the 
test material should be used, because rejection of such acute values 
would bias the Final Acute Value by eliminating acute values for 
resistant species.
    F. If the acute toxicity of the material to aquatic animals has been 
shown to be related to a water quality characteristic such as hardness 
or particulate matter for freshwater animals, refer to section V of this 
appendix.
    G. The agreement of the data within and between species must be 
considered. Acute values that appear to be questionable in comparison 
with other acute and chronic data for the same species and for other 
species in the same genus must not be used. For example, if the acute 
values available for a species or genus differ by more than a factor of 
10, rejection of some or all of the values would be appropriate, absent 
countervailing circumstances.
    H. If the available data indicate that one or more life stages are 
at least a factor of two more resistant than one or more other life 
stages of the same species, the data for the more resistant life stages 
must not be used in the calculation of the SMAV because a species cannot 
be considered protected from acute toxicity if all of the life stages 
are not protected.
    I. For each species for which at least one acute value is available, 
the SMAV shall be calculated as the geometric mean of the results of all 
acceptable flow-through acute toxicity tests in which the concentrations 
of test material were measured with the most sensitive tested life stage 
of the species. For a species for which no such result is available, the 
SMAV shall be calculated as the geometric mean of all acceptable acute 
toxicity tests with the most sensitive tested life stage, i.e., results 
of flow-through tests in which the concentrations were not measured and 
results of static and renewal tests based on initial concentrations 
(nominal concentrations are acceptable for most test materials if 
measured concentrations are not available) of test material. A renewal 
test is a test with aquatic organisms in which either the test solution 
in a test chamber is removed and replaced at least once during the test 
or the test organisms are transferred into a new test solution of the 
same composition at least once during the test. A static test is a test 
with aquatic organisms in which the solution and organisms that are in a 
test chamber at the beginning of the test remain in the chamber until 
the end of the test, except for removal of dead test organisms.

    Note 1: Data reported by original investigators must not be rounded 
off. Results of all intermediate calculations must not be rounded off to 
fewer than four significant digits.


[[Page 655]]


    Note 2: The geometric mean of N numbers is the Nth root of the 
product of the N numbers. Alternatively, the geometric mean can be 
calculated by adding the logarithms of the N numbers, dividing the sum 
by N, and taking the antilog of the quotient. The geometric mean of two 
numbers is the square root of the product of the two numbers, and the 
geometric mean of one number is that number. Either natural (base e) or 
common (base 10) logarithms can be used to calculate geometric means as 
long as they are used consistently within each set of data, i.e., the 
antilog used must match the logarithms used.

    Note 3: Geometric means, rather than arithmetic means, are used here 
because the distributions of sensitivities of individual organisms in 
toxicity tests on most materials and the distributions of sensitivities 
of species within a genus are more likely to be lognormal than normal. 
Similarly, geometric means are used for ACRs because quotients are 
likely to be closer to lognormal than normal distributions. In addition, 
division of the geometric mean of a set of numerators by the geometric 
mean of the set of denominators will result in the geometric mean of the 
set of corresponding quotients.

    J. For each genus for which one or more SMAVs are available, the 
GMAV shall be calculated as the geometric mean of the SMAVs available 
for the genus.
    K. Order the GMAVs from high to low.
    L. Assign ranks, R, to the GMAVs from ``1'' for the lowest to ``N'' 
for the highest. If two or more GMAVs are identical, assign them 
successive ranks.
    M. Calculate the cumulative probability, P, for each GMAV as R/
(N+1).
    N. Select the four GMAVs which have cumulative probabilities closest 
to 0.05 (if there are fewer than 59 GMAVs, these will always be the four 
lowest GMAVs).
    O. Using the four selected GMAVs, and Ps, calculate
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR95.104
    
    Note: Natural logarithms (logarithms to base e, denoted as ln) are 
used herein merely because they are easier to use on some hand 
calculators and computers than common (base 10) logarithms. Consistent 
use of either will produce the same result.

    P. If for a commercially or recreationally important species of the 
Great Lakes System the geometric mean of the acute values from flow-
through tests in which the concentrations of test material were measured 
is lower than the calculated Final Acute Value (FAV), then that 
geometric mean must be used as the FAV instead of the calculated FAV.
    Q. See section VI of this appendix.

                         V. Final Acute Equation

    A. When enough data are available to show that acute toxicity to two 
or more species is similarly related to a water quality characteristic, 
the relationship shall be taken into account as described in sections 
V.B through V.G of this appendix or using analysis of covariance. The 
two methods are equivalent and produce identical results. The manual 
method described below provides an understanding of this application of 
covariance analysis, but computerized versions of

[[Page 656]]

covariance analysis are much more convenient for analyzing large data 
sets. If two or more factors affect toxicity, multiple regression 
analysis shall be used.
    B. For each species for which comparable acute toxicity values are 
available at two or more different values of the water quality 
characteristic, perform a least squares regression of the acute toxicity 
values on the corresponding values of the water quality characteristic 
to obtain the slope and its 95 percent confidence limits for each 
species.

    Note: Because the best documented relationship is that between 
hardness and acute toxicity of metals in fresh water and a log-log 
relationship fits these data, geometric means and natural logarithms of 
both toxicity and water quality are used in the rest of this section. 
For relationships based on other water quality characteristics, such as 
Ph, temperature, no transformation or a different transformation might 
fit the data better, and appropriate changes will be necessary 
throughout this section.

    C. Decide whether the data for each species are relevant, taking 
into account the range and number of the tested values of the water 
quality characteristic and the degree of agreement within and between 
species. For example, a slope based on six data points might be of 
limited value if it is based only on data for a very narrow range of 
values of the water quality characteristic. A slope based on only two 
data points, however, might be useful if it is consistent with other 
information and if the two points cover a broad enough range of the 
water quality characteristic. In addition, acute values that appear to 
be questionable in comparison with other acute and chronic data 
available for the same species and for other species in the same genus 
should not be used. For example, if after adjustment for the water 
quality characteristic, the acute values available for a species or 
genus differ by more than a factor of 10, rejection of some or all of 
the values would be appropriate, absent countervailing justification. If 
useful slopes are not available for at least one fish and one 
invertebrate or if the available slopes are too dissimilar or if too few 
data are available to adequately define the relationship between acute 
toxicity and the water quality characteristic, return to section IV.G of 
this appendix, using the results of tests conducted under conditions and 
in waters similar to those commonly used for toxicity tests with the 
species.
    D. For each species, calculate the geometric mean of the available 
acute values and then divide each of the acute values for the species by 
the geometric mean for the species. This normalizes the acute values so 
that the geometric mean of the normalized values for each species 
individually and for any combination of species is 1.0.
    E. Similarly normalize the values of the water quality 
characteristic for each species individually using the same procedure as 
above.
    F. Individually for each species perform a least squares regression 
of the normalized acute values of the water quality characteristic. The 
resulting slopes and 95 percent confidence limits will be identical to 
those obtained in section V.B. of this appendix. If, however, the data 
are actually plotted, the line of best fit for each individual species 
will go through the point 1,1 in the center of the graph.
    G. Treat all of the normalized data as if they were all for the same 
species and perform a least squares regression of all of the normalized 
acute values on the corresponding normalized values of the water quality 
characteristic to obtain the pooled acute slope, V, and its 95 percent 
confidence limits. If all of the normalized data are actually plotted, 
the line of best fit will go through the point 1,1 in the center of the 
graph.
    H. For each species calculate the geometric mean, W, of the acute 
toxicity values and the geometric mean, X, of the values of the water 
quality characteristic. (These were calculated in sections V.D and V.E 
of this appendix).
    I. For each species, calculate the logarithm, Y, of the SMAV at a 
selected value, Z, of the water quality characteristic using the 
equation:

Y=ln W-V(ln X-ln Z)

    J. For each species calculate the SMAV at X using the equation:

SMAV=e<SUP>Y

    Note: Alternatively, the SMAVs at Z can be obtained by skipping step 
H above, using the equations in steps I and J to adjust each acute value 
individually to Z, and then calculating the geometric mean of the 
adjusted values for each species individually. This alternative 
procedure allows an examination of the range of the adjusted acute 
values for each species.

    K. Obtain the FAV at Z by using the procedure described in sections 
IV.J through IV.O of this appendix.
    L. If, for a commercially or recreationally important species of the 
Great Lakes System the geometric mean of the acute values at Z from 
flow-through tests in which the concentrations of the test material were 
measured is lower than the FAV at Z, then the geometric mean must be 
used as the FAV instead of the FAV.
    M. The Final Acute Equation is written as:

FAV=e<SUP>(V[ln(water quality characteristic)]+A-V[ln Z]),

    where:
V=pooled acute slope, and A=ln(FAV at Z).

    Because V, A, and Z are known, the FAV can be calculated for any 
selected value of the water quality characteristic.

[[Page 657]]

                         VI. Final Chronic Value

    A. Depending on the data that are available concerning chronic 
toxicity to aquatic animals, the Final Chronic Value (FCV) can be 
calculated in the same manner as the FAV or by dividing the FAV by the 
Final Acute-Chronic Ratio (FACR). In some cases, it might not be 
possible to calculate a FCV. The FCV is (a) a calculated estimate of the 
concentration of a test material such that 95 percent of the genera 
(with which acceptable chronic toxicity tests have been conducted on the 
material) have higher GMCVs, or (b) the quotient of an FAV divided by an 
appropriate ACR, or (c) the SMCV of an important and/or critical 
species, if the SMCV is lower than the calculated estimate or the 
quotient, whichever is applicable.

    Note: As the name implies, the ACR is a way of relating acute and 
chronic toxicities.

    B. Chronic values shall be based on results of flow-through (except 
renewal is acceptable for daphnids) chronic tests in which the 
concentrations of test material in the test solutions were properly 
measured at appropriate times during the test. A chronic test is a 
comparative study in which organisms, that are subjected to different 
treatments, are observed for a long period or a substantial portion of 
their life span.
    C. Results of chronic tests in which survival, growth, or 
reproduction in the control treatment was unacceptably low shall not be 
used. The limits of acceptability will depend on the species.
    D. Results of chronic tests conducted in unusual dilution water, 
e.g., dilution water in which total organic carbon or particulate matter 
exceeded five mg/L, should not be used, unless a relationship is 
developed between chronic toxicity and organic carbon or particulate 
matter, or unless data show that organic carbon, particulate matter, 
etc., do not affect toxicity.
    E. Chronic values must be based on endpoints and lengths of exposure 
appropriate to the species. Therefore, only results of the following 
kinds of chronic toxicity tests shall be used:
    1. Life-cycle toxicity tests consisting of exposures of each of two 
or more groups of individuals of a species to a different concentration 
of the test material throughout a life cycle. To ensure that all life 
stages and life processes are exposed, tests with fish should begin with 
embryos or newly hatched young less than 48 hours old, continue through 
maturation and reproduction, and should end not less than 24 days (90 
days for salmonids) after the hatching of the next generation. Tests 
with daphnids should begin with young less than 24 hours old and last 
for not less than 21 days, and for ceriodaphnids not less than seven 
days. For good examples of acceptable procedures see American Society 
for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard E 1193 Guide for conducting 
renewal life-cycle toxicity tests with Daphnia magna and ASTM Standard E 
1295 Guide for conducting three-brood, renewal toxicity tests with 
Ceriodaphnia dubia. Tests with mysids should begin with young less than 
24 hours old and continue until seven days past the median time of first 
brood release in the controls. For fish, data should be obtained and 
analyzed on survival and growth of adults and young, maturation of males 
and females, eggs spawned per female, embryo viability (salmonids only), 
and hatchability. For daphnids, data should be obtained and analyzed on 
survival and young per female. For mysids, data should be obtained and 
analyzed on survival, growth, and young per female.
    2. Partial life-cycle toxicity tests consist of exposures of each of 
two more groups of individuals of a species of fish to a different 
concentration of the test material through most portions of a life 
cycle. Partial life-cycle tests are allowed with fish species that 
require more than a year to reach sexual maturity, so that all major 
life stages can be exposed to the test material in less than 15 months. 
A life-cycle test is a comparative study in which organisms, that are 
subjected to different treatments, are observed at least from a life 
stage in one generation to the same life-stage in the next generation. 
Exposure to the test material should begin with immature juveniles at 
least two months prior to active gonad development, continue through 
maturation and reproduction, and end not less than 24 days (90 days for 
salmonids) after the hatching of the next generation. Data should be 
obtained and analyzed on survival and growth of adults and young, 
maturation of males and females, eggs spawned per female, embryo 
viability (salmonids only), and hatchability.
    3. Early life-stage toxicity tests consisting of 28- to 32-day (60 
days post hatch for salmonids) exposures of the early life stages of a 
species of fish from shortly after fertilization through embryonic, 
larval, and early juvenile development. Data should be obtained and 
analyzed on survival and growth.
    Note: Results of an early life-stage test are used as predictions of 
results of life-cycle and partial life-cycle tests with the same 
species. Therefore, when results of a life-cycle or partial life-cycle 
test are available, results of an early life-stage test with the same 
species should not be used. Also, results of early life-stage tests in 
which the incidence of mortalities or abnormalities increased 
substantially near the end of the test shall not be used because the 
results of such tests are possibly not good predictions of comparable 
life-cycle or partial life-cycle tests.
    F. A chronic value may be obtained by calculating the geometric mean 
of the lower

[[Page 658]]

and upper chronic limits from a chronic test or by analyzing chronic 
data using regression analysis.
    1. A lower chronic limit is the highest tested concentration:
    a. In an acceptable chronic test;
    b. Which did not cause an unacceptable amount of adverse effect on 
any of the specified biological measurements; and
    c. Below which no tested concentration caused an unacceptable 
effect.
    2. An upper chronic limit is the lowest tested concentration:
    a. In an acceptable chronic test;
    b. Which did cause an unacceptable amount of adverse effect on one 
or more of the specified biological measurements; and,
    c. Above which all tested concentrations also caused such an effect.
    Note: Because various authors have used a variety of terms and 
definitions to interpret and report results of chronic tests, reported 
results should be reviewed carefully. The amount of effect that is 
considered unacceptable is often based on a statistical hypothesis test, 
but might also be defined in terms of a specified percent reduction from 
the controls. A small percent reduction (e.g., three percent) might be 
considered acceptable even if it is statistically significantly 
different from the control, whereas a large percent reduction (e.g., 30 
percent) might be considered unacceptable even if it is not 
statistically significant.
    G. If the chronic toxicity of the material to aquatic animals has 
been shown to be related to a water quality characteristic such as 
hardness or particulate matter for freshwater animals, refer to section 
VII of this appendix.
    H. If chronic values are available for species in eight families as 
described in section III.B.1 of this appendix, a SMCV shall be 
calculated for each species for which at least one chronic value is 
available by calculating the geometric mean of the results of all 
acceptable life-cycle and partial life-cycle toxicity tests with the 
species; for a species of fish for which no such result is available, 
the SMCV is the geometric mean of all acceptable early life-stage tests. 
Appropriate GMCVs shall also be calculated. A GMCV is the geometric mean 
of the SMCVs for the genus. The FCV shall be obtained using the 
procedure described in sections IV.J through IV.O of this appendix, 
substituting SMCV and GMCV for SMAV and GMAV respectively. See section 
VI.M of this appendix.
    Note: Section VI.I through VI.L are for use when chronic values are 
not available for species in eight taxonomic families as described in 
section III.B.1 of this appendix.
    I. For each chronic value for which at least one corresponding 
appropriate acute value is available, calculate an ACR, using for the 
numerator the geometric mean of the results of all acceptable flow-
through (except static is acceptable for daphnids and midges) acute 
tests in the same dilution water in which the concentrations are 
measured. For fish, the acute test(s) should be conducted with 
juveniles. The acute test(s) should be part of the same study as the 
chronic test. If acute tests were not conducted as part of the same 
study, but were conducted as part of a different study in the same 
laboratory and dilution water, then they may be used. If no such acute 
tests are available, results of acute tests conducted in the same 
dilution water in a different laboratory may be used. If no such acute 
tests are available, an ACR shall not be calculated.
    J. For each species, calculate the SMACR as the geometric mean of 
all ACRs available for that species. If the minimum ACR data 
requirements (as described in section III.B.2 of this appendix) are not 
met with freshwater data alone, saltwater data may be used along with 
the freshwater data.
    K. For some materials, the ACR seems to be the same for all species, 
but for other materials the ratio seems to increase or decrease as the 
SMAV increases. Thus the FACR can be obtained in three ways, depending 
on the data available:
    1. If the species mean ACR seems to increase or decrease as the 
SMAVs increase, the FACR shall be calculated as the geometric mean of 
the ACRs for species whose SMAVs are close to the FAV.
    2. If no major trend is apparent and the ACRs for all species are 
within a factor of ten, the FACR shall be calculated as the geometric 
mean of all of the SMACRs.
    3. If the most appropriate SMACRs are less than 2.0, and especially 
if they are less than 1.0, acclimation has probably occurred during the 
chronic test. In this situation, because continuous exposure and 
acclimation cannot be assured to provide adequate protection in field 
situations, the FACR should be assumed to be two, so that the FCV is 
equal to the Criterion Maximum Concentration (CMC). (See section X.B of 
this appendix.)
    If the available SMACRs do not fit one of these cases, a FACR may 
not be obtained and a Tier I FCV probably cannot be calculated.
    L. Calculate the FCV by dividing the FAV by the FACR.
    FCV=FAV<divide>FACR
If there is a Final Acute Equation rather than a FAV, see also section V 
of this appendix.
    M. If the SMCV of a commercially or recreationally important species 
of the Great Lakes System is lower than the calculated FCV, then that 
SMCV must be used as the FCV instead of the calculated FCV.
    N. See section VIII of this appendix.

[[Page 659]]

                       VII. Final Chronic Equation

    A. A Final Chronic Equation can be derived in two ways. The 
procedure described in section VII.A of this appendix will result in the 
chronic slope being the same as the acute slope. The procedure described 
in sections VII.B through N of this appendix will usually result in the 
chronic slope being different from the acute slope.
    1. If ACRs are available for enough species at enough values of the 
water quality characteristic to indicate that the ACR appears to be the 
same for all species and appears to be independent of the water quality 
characteristic, calculate the FACR as the geometric mean of the 
available SMACRs.
    2. Calculate the FCV at the selected value Z of the water quality 
characteristic by dividing the FAV at Z (see section V.M of this 
appendix) by the FACR.
    3. Use V=pooled acute slope (see section V.M of this appendix), and
    L=pooled chronic slope.
    4. See section VII.M of this appendix.
    B. When enough data are available to show that chronic toxicity to 
at least one species is related to a water quality characteristic, the 
relationship should be taken into account as described in sections C 
through G below or using analysis of covariance. The two methods are 
equivalent and produce identical results. The manual method described 
below provides an understanding of this application of covariance 
analysis, but computerized versions of covariance analysis are much more 
convenient for analyzing large data sets. If two or more factors affect 
toxicity, multiple regression analysis shall be used.
    C. For each species for which comparable chronic toxicity values are 
available at two or more different values of the water quality 
characteristic, perform a least squares regression of the chronic 
toxicity values on the corresponding values of the water quality 
characteristic to obtain the slope and its 95 percent confidence limits 
for each species.

    Note: Because the best documented relationship is that between 
hardness and acute toxicity of metals in fresh water and a log-log 
relationship fits these data, geometric means and natural logarithms of 
both toxicity and water quality are used in the rest of this section. 
For relationships based on other water quality characteristics, such as 
Ph, temperature, no transformation or a different transformation might 
fit the data better, and appropriate changes will be necessary 
throughout this section. It is probably preferable, but not necessary, 
to use the same transformation that was used with the acute values in 
section V of this appendix.

    D. Decide whether the data for each species are relevant, taking 
into account the range and number of the tested values of the water 
quality characteristic and the degree of agreement within and between 
species. For example, a slope based on six data points might be of 
limited value if it is based only on data for a very narrow range of 
values of the water quality characteristic. A slope based on only two 
data points, however, might be more useful if it is consistent with 
other information and if the two points cover a broad range of the water 
quality characteristic. In addition, chronic values that appear to be 
questionable in comparison with other acute and chronic data available 
for the same species and for other species in the same genus in most 
cases should not be used. For example, if after adjustment for the water 
quality characteristic, the chronic values available for a species or 
genus differ by more than a factor of 10, rejection of some or all of 
the values is, in most cases, absent countervailing circumstances, 
appropriate. If a useful chronic slope is not available for at least one 
species or if the available slopes are too dissimilar or if too few data 
are available to adequately define the relationship between chronic 
toxicity and the water quality characteristic, it might be appropriate 
to assume that the chronic slope is the same as the acute slope, which 
is equivalent to assuming that the ACR is independent of the water 
quality characteristic. Alternatively, return to section VI.H of this 
appendix, using the results of tests conducted under conditions and in 
waters similar to those commonly used for toxicity tests with the 
species.
    E. Individually for each species, calculate the geometric mean of 
the available chronic values and then divide each chronic value for a 
species by the mean for the species. This normalizes the chronic values 
so that the geometric mean of the normalized values for each species 
individually, and for any combination of species, is 1.0.
    F. Similarly, normalize the values of the water quality 
characteristic for each species individually.
    G. Individually for each species, perform a least squares regression 
of the normalized chronic toxicity values on the corresponding 
normalized values of the water quality characteristic. The resulting 
slopes and the 95 percent confidence limits will be identical to those 
obtained in section VII.B of this appendix. Now, however, if the data 
are actually plotted, the line of best fit for each individual species 
will go through the point 1,1 in the center of the graph.
    H. Treat all of the normalized data as if they were all the same 
species and perform a least squares regression of all of the normalized 
chronic values on the corresponding normalized values of the water 
quality characteristic to obtain the pooled chronic slope, L, and its 95 
percent confidence limits.
    If all normalized data are actually plotted, the line of best fit 
will go through the point 1,1 in the center of the graph.

[[Page 660]]

    I. For each species, calculate the geometric mean, M, of the 
toxicity values and the geometric mean, P, of the values of the water 
quality characteristic. (These are calculated in sections VII.E and F of 
this appendix.)
    J. For each species, calculate the logarithm, Q, of the SMCV at a 
selected value, Z, of the water quality characteristic using the 
equation:

Q=ln M--L(ln P-ln Z)

    Note: Although it is not necessary, it is recommended that the same 
value of the water quality characteristic be used here as was used in 
section V of this appendix.

    K. For each species, calculate a SMCV at Z using the equation:

SMCV=e<SUP>Q

    Note: Alternatively, the SMCV at Z can be obtained by skipping 
section VII.J of this appendix, using the equations in sections VII.J 
and K of this appendix to adjust each chronic value individually to Z, 
and then calculating the geometric means of the adjusted values for each 
species individually. This alternative procedure allows an examination 
of the range of the adjusted chronic values for each species.

    L. Obtain the FCV at Z by using the procedure described in sections 
IV.J through O of this appendix.
    M. If the SMCV at Z of a commercially or recreationally important 
species of the Great Lakes System is lower than the calculated FCV at Z, 
then that SMCV shall be used as the FCV at Z instead of the calculated 
FCV.
    N. The Final Chronic Equation is written as:

FCV=e<SUP>(L[ln(water quality characteristic)]+lnS-L[lnZ])

Where:

L=pooled chronic slope and S = FCV at Z.

    Because L, S, and Z are known, the FCV can be calculated for any 
selected value of the water quality characteristic.

                         VIII. Final Plant Value

    A. A Final Plant Value (FPV) is the lowest plant value that was 
obtained with an important aquatic plant species in an acceptable 
toxicity test for which the concentrations of the test material were 
measured and the adverse effect was biologically important. Appropriate 
measures of the toxicity of the material to aquatic plants are used to 
compare the relative sensitivities of aquatic plants and animals. 
Although procedures for conducting and interpreting the results of 
toxicity tests with plants are not well-developed, results of tests with 
plants usually indicate that criteria which adequately protect aquatic 
animals and their uses will, in most cases, also protect aquatic plants 
and their uses.
    B. A plant value is the result of a 96-hour test conducted with an 
alga or a chronic test conducted with an aquatic vascular plant.

    Note: A test of the toxicity of a metal to a plant shall not be used 
if the medium contained an excessive amount of a complexing agent, such 
as EDTA, that might affect the toxicity of the metal. Concentrations of 
EDTA above 200 <greek-m>g/L should be considered excessive.

    C. The FPV shall be obtained by selecting the lowest result from a 
test with an important aquatic plant species in which the concentrations 
of test material are measured and the endpoint is biologically 
important.

                             IX. Other Data

    Pertinent information that could not be used in earlier sections 
might be available concerning adverse effects on aquatic organisms. The 
most important of these are data on cumulative and delayed toxicity, 
reduction in survival, growth, or reproduction, or any other adverse 
effect that has been shown to be biologically important. Delayed 
toxicity is an adverse effect to an organism that results from, and 
occurs after the end of, its exposure to one or more test materials. 
Especially important are data for species for which no other data are 
available. Data from behavioral, biochemical, physiological, microcosm, 
and field studies might also be available. Data might be available from 
tests conducted in unusual dilution water (see sections IV.D and VI.D of 
this appendix), from chronic tests in which the concentrations were not 
measured (see section VI.B of this appendix), from tests with previously 
exposed organisms (see section II.F.3 of this appendix), and from tests 
on formulated mixtures or emulsifiable concentrates (see section II.D of 
this appendix). Such data might affect a criterion if the data were 
obtained with an important species, the test concentrations were 
measured, and the endpoint was biologically important.

                              X. Criterion

    A. A criterion consists of two concentrations: the CMC and the 
Criterion Continuous Concentration (CCC).
    B. The CMC is equal to one-half the FAV. The CMC is an estimate of 
the highest concentration of a material in the water column to which an 
aquatic community can be exposed briefly without resulting in an 
unacceptable effect.
    C. The CCC is equal to the lowest of the FCV or the FPV (if 
available) unless other data (see section IX of this appendix) show that 
a lower value should be used. The CCC is an estimate of the highest 
concentration of a material in the water column to which an aquatic 
community can be exposed indefinitely without resulting in an 
unacceptable

[[Page 661]]

effect. If toxicity is related to a water quality characteristic, the 
CCC is obtained from the Final Chronic Equation or FPV (if available) 
that results in the lowest concentrations in the usual range of the 
water quality characteristic, unless other data (see section IX) show 
that a lower value should be used.
    D. Round both the CMC and the CCC to two significant digits.
    E. The criterion is stated as:
    The procedures described in the Tier I methodology indicate that, 
except possibly where a commercially or recreationally important species 
is very sensitive, aquatic organisms should not be affected unacceptably 
if the four-day average concentration of (1) does not exceed (2) 
<greek-m>g/L more than once every three years on the average and if the 
one-hour average concentration does not exceed (3) <greek-m>g/L more 
than once every three years on the average.
Where:

(1) = insert name of material
(2) = insert the CCC
(3) = insert the CMC

    If the CMC averaging period of one hour or the CCC averaging period 
of four days is inappropriate for the pollutant, or if the once-in-
three-year allowable excursion frequency is inappropriate for the 
pollutant or for the sites to which a criterion is applied, then the 
State may specify alternative averaging periods or frequencies. The 
choice of an alternative averaging period or frequency shall be 
justified by a scientifically defensible analysis demonstrating that the 
alternative values will protect the aquatic life uses of the water. 
Appropriate laboratory data and/or well-designed field biological 
surveys shall be submitted to EPA as justification for differing 
averaging periods and/or frequencies of exceedance.

                            XI. Final Review

    A. The derivation of the criterion should be carefully reviewed by 
rechecking each step of the Guidance in this part. Items that should be 
especially checked are:
    1. If unpublished data are used, are they well documented?
    2. Are all required data available?
    3. Is the range of acute values for any species greater than a 
factor of 10?
    4. Is the range of SMAVs for any genus greater than a factor of 10?
    5. Is there more than a factor of 10 difference between the four 
lowest GMAVs?
    6. Are any of the lowest GMAVs questionable?
    7. Is the FAV reasonable in comparison with the SMAVs and GMAVs?
    8. For any commercially or recreationally important species of the 
Great Lakes System, is the geometric mean of the acute values from flow-
through tests in which the concentrations of test material were measured 
lower than the FAV?
    9. Are any of the chronic values used questionable?
    10. Are any chronic values available for acutely sensitive species?
    11. Is the range of acute-chronic ratios greater than a factor of 
10?
    12. Is the FCV reasonable in comparison with the available acute and 
chronic data?
    13. Is the measured or predicted chronic value for any commercially 
or recreationally important species of the Great Lakes System below the 
FCV?
    14. Are any of the other data important?
    15. Do any data look like they might be outliers?
    16. Are there any deviations from the Guidance in this part? Are 
they acceptable?
    B. On the basis of all available pertinent laboratory and field 
information, determine if the criterion is consistent with sound 
scientific evidence. If it is not, another criterion, either higher or 
lower, shall be derived consistent with the Guidance in this part.

          Methodology for Deriving Aquatic Life Values: Tier II

                       XII. Secondary Acute Value

    If all eight minimum data requirements for calculating an FAV using 
Tier I are not met, a Secondary Acute Value (SAV) for the waters of the 
Great Lakes System shall be calculated for a chemical as follows:
    To calculate a SAV, the lowest GMAV in the database is divided by 
the Secondary Acute Factor (SAF) (Table A-1 of this appendix) 
corresponding to the number of satisfied minimum data requirements 
listed in the Tier I methodology (section III.B.1 of this appendix). 
(Requirements for definitions, data collection and data review, 
contained in sections I, II, and IV shall be applied to calculation of a 
SAV.) If all eight minimum data requirements are satisfied, a Tier I 
criterion calculation may be possible. In order to calculate a SAV, the 
database must contain, at a minimum, a genus mean acute value (GMAV) for 
one of the following three genera in the family Daphnidae--Ceriodaphnia 
sp., Daphnia sp., or Simocephalus sp.
    If appropriate, the SAV shall be made a function of a water quality 
characteristic in a manner similar to that described in Tier I.

                   XIII. Secondary Acute-Chronic Ratio

    If three or more experimentally determined ACRs, meeting the data 
collection and review requirements of Section VI of this appendix, are 
available for the chemical, determine the FACR using the procedure 
described in Section VI. If fewer than three acceptable experimentally 
determined ACRs are available, use enough assumed ACRs of

[[Page 662]]

18 so that the total number of ACRs equals three. Calculate the 
Secondary Acute-Chronic Ratio (SACR) as the geometric mean of the three 
ACRs. Thus, if no experimentally determined ACRs are available, the SACR 
is 18.

                      XIV. Secondary Chronic Value

    Calculate the Secondary Chronic Value (SCV) using one of the 
following:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR95.099

    If appropriate, the SCV will be made a function of a water quality 
characteristic in a manner similar to that described in Tier I.

          XV. Commercially or Recreationally Important Species

    If for a commercially or recreationally important species of the 
Great Lakes System the geometric mean of the acute values or chronic 
values from flow-through tests in which the concentrations of the test 
materials were measured is lower than the calculated SAV or SCV, then 
that geometric mean must be used as the SAV or SCV instead of the 
calculated SAV or SCV.

                           XVI. Tier II Value

    A. A Tier II value shall consist of two concentrations: the 
Secondary Maximum Concentration (SMC) and the Secondary Continuous 
Concentration (SCC).
    B. The SMC is equal to one-half of the SAV.
    C. The SCC is equal to the lowest of the SCV or the Final Plant 
Value, if available, unless other data (see section IX of this appendix) 
show that a lower value should be used.
    If toxicity is related to a water quality characteristic, the SCC is 
obtained from the Secondary Chronic Equation or FPV, if available, that 
results in the lowest concentrations in the usual range of the water 
quality characteristic, unless other data (See section IX of this 
appendix) show that a lower value should be used.
    D. Round both the SMC and the SCC to two significant digits.
    E. The Tier II value is stated as:
    The procedures described in the Tier II methodology indicate that, 
except possibly where a locally important species is very sensitive, 
aquatic organisms should not be affected unacceptably if the four-day 
average concentration of (1) does not exceed (2) <greek-m>g/L more than 
once every three years on the average and if the one-hour average 
concentration does not exceed (3) <greek-m>g/L more than once every 
three years on the average.

Where:

(1) = insert name of material
(2) = insert the SCC
(3) = insert the SMC
    As discussed above, States and Tribes have the discretion to specify 
alternative averaging periods or frequencies (see section X.E. of this 
appendix).

                     XVII. Appropriate Modifications

    On the basis of all available pertinent laboratory and field 
information, determine if the Tier II value is consistent with sound 
scientific evidence. If it is not, another value, either higher or 
lower, shall be derived consistent with the Guidance in this part.

      Appendix B to Part 132--Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative

            Methodology for Deriving Bioaccumulation Factors

    Great Lakes States and Tribes shall adopt provisions consistent with 
(as protective as) this appendix.

                             I. Introduction

    A. The purpose of this methodology is to describe procedures for 
deriving bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) to be used in the calculation of 
Great Lakes Water Quality Guidance (Guidance) human health Tier I 
criteria and Tier II values and wildlife Tier I criteria. A subset of 
the human health BAFs are also used to identify the chemicals that are 
considered bioaccumulative chemicals of concern (BCCs).
    B. Bioaccumulation reflects uptake of a substance by aquatic 
organisms exposed to the substance through all routes (i.e., ambient 
water and food), as would occur in nature. Bioconcentration reflects 
uptake of a substance by aquatic organisms exposed to the substance only 
through the ambient water. Both BAFs and bioconcentration factors (BCFs) 
are proportionality constants that describe the relationship between the 
concentration of a substance in aquatic organisms and its concentration 
in the ambient water. For the Guidance in this part, BAFs, rather than 
BCFs, are used to calculate Tier I criteria for human health and 
wildlife and Tier II values for human health because they better account 
for the total exposure of aquatic organisms to chemicals.
    C. For organic chemicals, baseline BAFs can be derived using four 
methods. Measured baseline BAFs are derived from field-measured BAFs; 
predicted baseline BAFs are derived using biota-sediment accumulation 
factors (BSAFs) or are derived by multiplying a laboratory-measured or 
predicted BCF by a food-chain multiplier (FCM). The lipid content of the 
aquatic organisms is used to account for partitioning of organic 
chemicals within organisms so that data from different tissues and 
species can be integrated. In addition, the baseline BAF is based on the 
concentration of freely dissolved organic chemicals in the ambient water 
to facilitate extrapolation from one water to another.
    D. For inorganic chemicals, baseline BAFs can be derived using two 
of the four methods. Baseline BAFs are derived using either field-
measured BAFs or by multiplying laboratory-measured BCFs by a FCM. For 
inorganic chemicals, BAFs are assumed to equal BCFs (i.e., the FCM is 
1.0), unless chemical-specific biomagnification data support using a FCM 
other than 1.0.
    E. Because both humans and wildlife consume fish from both trophic 
levels 3 and 4, two baseline BAFs are needed to calculate either a human 
health criterion or value or a wildlife criterion for a chemical. When 
appropriate, ingestion through consumption of invertebrates, plants, 
mammals, and birds in the diet of wildlife species to be protected may 
be taken into account.

                             II. Definitions

    Baseline BAF. For organic chemicals, a BAF that is based on the 
concentration of freely dissolved chemical in the ambient water and 
takes into account the partitioning of the chemical within the organism; 
for inorganic chemicals, a BAF that is based on the wet weight of the 
tissue.
    Baseline BCF. For organic chemicals, a BCF that is based on the 
concentration of freely dissolved chemical in the ambient water and 
takes into account the partitioning of the chemical within the organism; 
for inorganic chemicals, a BCF that is based on the wet weight of the 
tissue.
    Bioaccumulation. The net accumulation of a substance by an organism 
as a result of uptake from all environmental sources.
    Bioaccumulation factor (BAF). The ratio (in L/kg) of a substance's 
concentration in tissue of an aquatic organism to its concentration in 
the ambient water, in situations where both the organism and its food 
are exposed to and the ratio does not change substantially over time.
    Bioconcentration. The net accumulation of a substance by an aquatic 
organism as a result of uptake directly from the ambient water through 
gill membranes or other external body surfaces.
    Bioconcentration factor (BCF). The ratio (in L/kg) of a substance's 
concentration in tissue of an aquatic organism to its concentration in 
the ambient water, in situations where the organism is exposed through 
the water only and the ratio does not change substantially over time.
    Biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF). The ratio (in kg of 
organic carbon/kg of lipid) of a substance's lipid-normalized 
concentration in tissue of an aquatic organism to its organic carbon-
normalized concentration in surface sediment, in situations where the 
ratio does not change substantially over time, both the organism and its 
food are exposed, and the surface sediment is representative of average 
surface sediment in the vicinity of the organism.
    Depuration. The loss of a substance from an organism as a result of 
any active or passive process.
    Food-chain multiplier (FCM). The ratio of a BAF to an appropriate 
BCF.
    Octanol-water partition coefficient (K<INF>OW). The ration of the 
concentration of a substance in the n-octanol phase to its concentration 
in the aqueous phase in an equilibrated two-phase octanol-water system. 
For log K<INF>OW, the log of the octanol-water partition coefficient is 
a base 10 logarithm.

    Uptake. Acquisition of a substance from the environment by an 
organism as a result of any active or passive process.

                    III. Review and Selection of Data

    A. Data Sources.  Measured BAFs, BSAFs and BCFs are assembled from 
available sources including the following:
    1. EPA Ambient Water Quality Criteria documents issued after January 
1, 1980.
    2. Published scientific literature.
    3. Reports issued by EPA or other reliable sources.
    4. Unpublished data.
    One useful source of references is the Aquatic Toxicity Information 
Retrieval (AQUIRE) database.
    B. Field-Measured BAFs. The following procedural and quality 
assurance requirements shall be met for field-measured BAFs:
    1. The field studies used shall be limited to those conducted in the 
Great Lakes System with fish at or near the top of the aquatic food 
chain (i.e., in trophic levels 3 and/or 4).
    2. The trophic level of the fish species shall be determined.
    3. The site of the field study should not be so unique that the BAF 
cannot be extrapolated to other locations where the criteria and values 
will apply.
    4. For organic chemicals, the percent lipid shall be either measured 
or reliably estimated for the tissue used in the determination of the 
BAF.
    5. The concentration of the chemical in the water shall be measured 
in a way that can be related to particulate organic carbon (POC) and/or 
dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and should be relatively constant during 
the steady-state time period.
    6. For organic chemicals with log K<INF>ow greater than four, the 
concentrations of POC and DOC in the ambient water shall be either 
measured or reliably estimated.
    7. For inorganic and organic chemicals, BAFs shall be used only if 
they are expressed on a wet weight basis; BAFs reported on a dry weight 
basis cannot be converted to wet weight unless a conversion factor is 
measured or reliably estimated for the tissue used in the determination 
of the BAF.
    C. Field-Measured BSAFs. The following procedural and quality 
assurance requirements shall be met for field-measured BSAFs:
    1. The field studies used shall be limited to those conducted in the 
Great Lakes System with fish at or near the top of the aquatic food 
chain (i.e., in trophic levels 3 and/or 4).
    2. Samples of surface sediments (0-1 cm is ideal) shall be from 
locations in which there is net deposition of fine sediment and is 
representative of average surface sediment in the vicinity of the 
organism.
    3. The K<INF>ows used shall be acceptable quality as described in 
section III.F below.
    4. The site of the field study should not be so unique that the 
resulting BAF cannot be extrapolated to other locations where the 
criteria and values will apply.
    5. The tropic level of the fish species shall be determined.
    6. The percent lipid shall be either measured or reliably estimated 
for the tissue used in the determination of the BAF.
    D. Laboratory-Measured BCFs. The following procedural and quality 
assurance requirements shall be met for laboratory-measured BCFs:
    1. The test organism shall not be diseased, unhealthy, or adversely 
affected by the concentration of the chemical.
    2. The total concentration of the chemical in the water shall be 
measured and should be relatively constant during the steady-state time 
period.
    3. The organisms shall be exposed to the chemical using a flow-
through or renewal procedure.
    4. For organic chemicals, the percent lipid shall be either measured 
or reliably estimated for the tissue used in the determination of the 
BCF.
    5. For organic chemicals with log K<INF>ow greater than four, the 
concentrations of POC and DOC in the test solution shall be either 
measured or reliably estimated.
    6. Laboratory-measured BCFs should be determined using fish species, 
but BCFs determined with molluscs and other invertebrates may be used 
with caution. For example, because invertebrates metabolize some 
chemicals less efficiently than vertebrates, a baseline BCF determined 
for such a chemical using invertebrates is expected to be higher than a 
comparable baseline BCF determined using fish.
    7. If laboratory-measured BCFs increase or decrease as the 
concentration of the chemical increases in the test solutions in a 
bioconcentration test, the BCF measured at the lowest test concentration 
that is above concentrations existing in the control water shall be used 
(i.e., a BCF should be calculated from a control treatment). The 
concentrations of an inorganic chemical in a bioconcentration test 
should be greater than normal background levels and greater than levels 
required for normal nutrition of the test species if the chemical is a 
micronutrient, but below levels that adversely affect the species. 
Bioaccummulation of an inorganic chemical might be overestimated if 
concentrations are at or below normal background levels due to, for 
example, nutritional requirements of the test organisms.
    8. For inorganic and organic chemicals, BCFs shall be used only if 
they are expressed on a wet weight basis. BCFs reported on a dry weight 
basis cannot be converted to wet weight unless a conversion factor is 
measured or reliably estimated for the tissue used in the determination 
of the BAF.

[[Page 665]]

    9. BCFs for organic chemicals may be based on measurement or 
radioactivity only when the BCF is intended to include metabolites or 
when there is confidence that there is no interference due to 
metabolites.
    10. The calculation of the BCF must appropriately address growth 
dilution.
    11. Other aspects of the methodology used should be similar to those 
described by ASTM (1990).
    E. Predicted BCFs. The following procedural and quality assurance 
requirements shall be met for predicted BCFs:
    1. The K<INF>ow used shall be of acceptable quality as described in 
section III.F below.
    2. The predicted baseline BCF shall be calculated using the 
equation: predicted baseline BCF = K<INF>ow
    where:
    K<INF>ow = octanol-water partition coefficient.
    F. Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient (K<INF>ow). 1. The value of 
K<INF>ow used for an organic chemical shall be determined by giving 
priority to the experimental and computational techniques used as 
follows:
    Log K<INF>ow < 4:

5.................................  Calculated by the CLOGP program.    
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. The CLOGP program is a computer program available from Pomona 
College. A value of K<INF>ow that seems to be different from the others 
should be considered an outlier and not used. The value of K<INF>ow used 
for an organic chemical shall be the geometric mean of the available 
K<INF>ows with highest priority or can be calculated from the arithmetic 
mean of the available log K<INF>ow with the highest priority. Because it 
is an intermediate value in the derivation of a BAF, the value used for 
the K<INF>ow of a chemical should not be rounded to fewer than three 
significant digits and a value for log K<INF>ow should not be rounded to 
fewer than three significant digits after the decimal point.
    G. This methodology provides overall guidance for the derivation of 
BAFs, but it cannot cover all the decisions that must be made in the 
review and selection of acceptable data. Professional judgment is 
required throughout the process. A degree of uncertainty is associated 
with the determination of any BAF, BSAF, BCF or K<INF>ow. The amount of 
uncertainty in a baseline BAF depends on both the quality of data 
available and the method used to derive the BAF.
    H. Hereinafter in this methodology, the terms BAF, BSAF, BCF and 
K<INF>ow refer to ones that are consistent with the procedural and 
quality assurance requirements given above.

               IV. Four Methods for Deriving Baseline BAFs

    Baseline BAFs shall be derived using the following four methods, 
which are listed from most preferred to least preferred:
    A. A measured baseline BAF for an organic or inorganic chemical 
derived from a field study of acceptable quality.
    B. A predicted baseline BAF for an organic chemical derived using 
field-measured BSAFs of acceptable quality.
    C. A predicted baseline BAF for an organic or inorganic chemical 
derived from a BCF measured in a laboratory study of acceptable quality 
and a FCM.
    D. A predicted baseline BAF for an organic chemical derived from a 
K<INF>ow of acceptable quality and a FCM.
    For comparative purposes, baseline BAFs should be derived for each 
chemical by as many of the four methods as available data allow.

          V. Calculation of Baseline BAFs for Organic Chemicals

    A. Lipid Normalization. 1. It is assumed that BAFs and BCFs for 
organic chemicals can be extrapolated on the basis of percent lipid from 
one tissue to another and from one aquatic species to another in most 
cases.
    2. Because BAFs and BCFs for organic chemicals are related to the 
percent lipid, it does not make any difference whether the tissue sample 
is whole body or edible portion, but both the BAF (or BCF) and the 
percent lipid must be determined for the same tissue. The percent lipid 
of the tissue should be measured during the BAF or BCF study, but in 
some cases it can be reliably estimated from measurements on tissue from 
other organisms. If percent lipid is not reported for the test organisms 
in the original study, it may be obtained from the author; or, in the 
case of a laboratory study, lipid data for the same or a comparable 
laboratory population of test organisms that were used in the original 
study may be used.

[[Page 666]]

    3. The lipid-normalized concentration, C<INF>l, of a chemical in 
tissue is defined using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR95.100

Where:

C<INF>B=concentration of the organic chemical in the tissue of aquatic 
          biota (either whole organism or specified tissue) (<greek-m>g/
          g).
f<INF>l=fraction of the tissue that is lipid.

    B. Bioavailability. By definition, baseline BAFs and BCFs for 
organic chemicals, whether measured or predicted are based on the 
concentration of the chemical that is freely dissolved in the ambient 
water in order to account for bioavailability. For the purposes of this 
Guidance in this part, the relationship between the total concentration 
of the chemical in the water (i.e., that which is freely dissolved plus 
that which is sorbed to particulate organic carbon or to dissolved 
organic carbon) to the freely dissolved concentration of the chemical in 
the ambient water shall be calculated using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR95.101

Where:

C<SUP>fd<INF>w=freely dissolved concentration of the organic chemical in 
          the ambient water;
C<SUP>t<INF>w=total concentration of the organic chemical in the ambient 
          water;
f<INF>fd=fraction of the total chemical in the ambient water that is 
          freely dissolved.

    The fraction of the total chemical in the ambient water that is 
freely dissolved, f<INF>fd, shall be calculated using the following 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR95.102

Where:

DOC=concentration of dissolved organic carbon, kg of dissolved organic 
          carbon/L of water.
K<INF>OW=octanol-water partition coefficient of the chemical.
POC=concentration of particulate organic carbon, kg of particulate 
          organic carbon/L of water.

    C. Food-Chain Multiplier. In the absence of a field-measured BAF or 
a predicted BAF derived from a BSAF, a FCM shall be used to calculate 
the baseline BAF for trophic levels 3 and 4 from a laboratory-measured 
or predicted BCF. For an organic chemical, the FCM used shall be derived 
from Table B-1 using the chemical's log K<INF>OW and linear 
interpolation. A FCM greater than 1.0 applies to most organic chemicals 
with a log K<INF>OW of four or more. The trophic level used shall take 
into account the age or size of the fish species consumed by the human, 
avian or mammalian predator because, for some species of fish, the young 
are in trophic level 3 whereas the adults are in trophic level 4.
    D. Calculation of a Baseline BAF from a Field-Measured BAF. A 
baseline BAF shall be calculated from a field-measured BAF of acceptable 
quality using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR95.103

Where:

BAF<SUP>t<INF>T=BAF based on total concentration in tissue and water.
f<INF>l=fraction of the tissue that is lipid.
f<INF>fd=fraction of the total chemical that is freely dissolved in the 
          ambient water.


[[Page 667]]


The trophic level to which the baseline BAF applies is the same as the 
trophic level of the organisms used in the determination of the field-
measured BAF. For each trophic level, a species mean measured baseline 
BAF shall be calculated as the geometric mean if more than one measured 
baseline BAF is available for a given species. For each trophic level, 
the geometric mean of the species mean measured baseline BAFs shall be 
calculated. If a baseline BAF based on a measured BAF is available for 
either trophic level 3 or 4, but not both, a measured baseline BAF for 
the other trophic level shall be calculated using the ratio of the FCMs 
that are obtained by linear interpolation from Table B-1 for the 
chemical.
    E. Calculation of a Baseline BAF from a Field-Measured BSAF. 1. A 
baseline BAF for organic chemical ``i'' shall be calculated from a 
field-measured BSAF of acceptable quality using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR95.105

Where:

(BSAF)<INF>i=BSAF for chemical ``i''.
(BSAF)<INF>r=BSAF for the reference chemical ``r''.
(K<INF>OW)<INF>i=octanol-water partition coefficient for chemical ``i''.
(K<INF>OW)<INF>r=octanol-water partition coefficient for the reference 
          chemical ``r''.

    2. A BSAF shall be calculated using the following equation:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR95.106
    
Where:

C<INF>t=the lipid-normalized concentration of the chemical in tissue.
C<INF>SOC=the organic carbon-normalized concentration of the chemical in 
          sediment.

    3. The organic carbon-normalized concentration of a chemical in 
sediment, C<INF>SOC, shall be calculated using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR95.107

                                 Where:

C<INF>S=concentration of chemical in sediment (<greek-m>g/g sediment).
f<INF>OC=fraction of the sediment that is organic carbon.

    4. Predicting BAFs from BSAFs requires data from a steady-state (or 
near steady-state) condition between sediment and ambient water for both 
a reference chemical ``r'' with a field-measured BAF<INF>l<SUP>fd and 
other chemicals ``n=i'' for which BSAFs are to be determined.
    5. The trophic level to which the baseline BAF applies is the same 
as the trophic level of the organisms used in the determination of the 
BSAF. For each trophic level, a species mean baseline BAF shall be 
calculated as the geometric mean if more than one baseline BAF is 
predicted from BSAFs for a given species. For each trophic level, the 
geometric mean of the species mean baseline BAFs derived using BSAFs 
shall be calculated.
    6. If a baseline BAF based on a measured BSAF is available for 
either trophic level 3 or 4, but not both, a baseline BAF for the other 
trophic level shall be calculated using the ratio of the FCMs that are 
obtained by linear interpolation from Table B-1 for the chemical.
    F. Calculation of a Baseline BAF from a Laboratory-Measured BCF. A 
baseline BAF for

[[Page 668]]

trophic level 3 and a baseline BAF for trophic level 4 shall be 
calculated from a laboratory-measured BCF of acceptable quality and a 
FCM using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR95.108

Where:

BCF<SUP>t<INF>T=BCF based on total concentration in tissue and water.
f<INF>l=fraction of the tissue that is lipid.
f<INF>fd=fraction of the total chemical in the test water that is freely 
          dissolved.
FCM=the food-chain multiplier obtained from Table B-1 by linear 
          interpolation for trophic level 3 or 4, as necessary.

For each trophic level, a species mean baseline BAF shall be calculated 
as the geometric mean if more than one baseline BAF is predicted from 
laboratory-measured BCFs for a given species. For each trophic level, 
the geometric mean of the species mean baseline BAFs based on 
laboratory-measured BCFs shall be calculated.
    G. Calculation of a Baseline BAF from an Octanol-Water Partition 
Coefficient. A baseline BAF for trophic level 3 and a baseline BAF for 
trophic level 4 shall be calculated from a K<INF>OW of acceptable 
quality and a FCM using the following equation:
    Baseline BAF=(FCM) (predicted baseline BCF)=(FCM) (K<INF>OW)

Where:

FCM=the food-chain multiplier obtained from Table B-1 by linear 
          interpolation for trophic level 3 or 4, as necessary.
K<INF>OW=octanol-water partition coefficient.

        VI. Human Health and Wildlife BAFs for Organic Chemicals

    A. To calculate human health and wildlife BAFs for an organic 
chemical, the K<INF>OW of the chemical shall be used with a POC 
concentration of 0.00000004 kg/L and a DOC concentration of 0.000002 kg/
L to yield the fraction freely dissolved:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR95.109

    B. The human health BAFs for an organic chemical shall be calculated 
using the following equations:
    For trophic level 3:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR95.110
    
    For trophic level 4:

[[Page 669]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR95.111


Where:

    0.0182 and 0.0310 are the standardized fraction lipid values for 
trophic levels 3 and 4, respectively, that are used to derive human 
health criteria and values for the GLI.
    C. The wildlife BAFs for an organic chemical shall be calculated 
using the following equations:
    For trophic level 3:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR95.112
    
    For trophic level 4:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR95.113
    
Where:
    0.0646 and 0.1031 are the standardized fraction lipid values for 
trophic levels 3 and 4, respectively, that are used to derive wildlife 
criteria for the GLI.

       VII. Human Health and Wildlife BAFs for Inorganic Chemicals

    A. For inorganic chemicals, the baseline BAFs for trophic levels 3 
and 4 are both assumed to equal the BCF determined for the chemical with 
fish, i.e., the FCM is assumed to be 1 for both trophic levels 3 and 4. 
However, a FCM greater than 1 might be applicable to some metals, such 
as mercury, if, for example, an organometallic form of the metal 
biomagnifies.
    B. BAFs for Human Health Criteria and Values.
    1. Measured BAFs and BCFs used to determine human health BAFs for 
inorganic chemicals shall be based on edible tissue (e.g., muscle) of 
freshwater fish unless it is demonstrated that whole-body BAFs or BCFs 
are similar to edible-tissue BAFs or BCFs. BCFs and BAFs based on 
measurements of aquatic plants and invertebrates should not be used in 
the derivation of human health criteria and values.
    2. If one or more field-measured baseline BAFs for an inorganic 
chemical are available from studies conducted in the Great Lakes System 
with the muscle of fish:
    a. For each trophic level, a species mean measured baseline BAF 
shall be calculated as the geometric mean if more than one measured BAF 
is available for a given species; and
    b. For each trophic level, the geometric mean of the species mean 
measured baseline BAFs shall be used as the human health BAF for that 
chemical.
    3. If an acceptable measured baseline BAF is not available for an 
inorganic chemical and one or more acceptable edible-portion laboratory-
measured BCFs are available for the chemical, a predicted baseline BAF 
shall be calculated by multiplying the geometric mean of the BCFs times 
a FCM. The FCM will be 1.0 unless chemical-specific biomagnification 
data support using a multiplier other than 1.0. The predicted baseline 
BAF shall be used as the human health BAF for that chemical.
    C. BAFs for Wildlife Criteria.
    1. Measured BAFs and BCFs used to determine wildlife BAFs for 
inorganic chemicals shall be based on whole-body freshwater fish and 
invertebrate data unless it is demonstrated that edible-tissue BAFs or 
BCFs are similar to whole-body BAFs or BCFs.
    2. If one or more field-measured baseline BAFs for an inorganic 
chemical are available from studies conducted in the Great Lakes System 
with whole body of fish or invertebrates:
    a. For each trophic level, a species mean measured baseline BAF 
shall be calculated as the geometric mean if more than one measured BAF 
is available for a given species.
    b. For each trophic level, the geometric mean of the species mean 
measured baseline BAFs shall be used as the wildlife BAF for that 
chemical.
    3. If an acceptable measured baseline BAF is not available for an 
inorganic chemical and one or more acceptable whole-body laboratory-
measured BCFs are available for the chemical, a predicted baseline BAF 
shall be calculated by multiplying the geometric

[[Page 670]]

mean of the BCFs times a FCM. The FCM will be 1.0 unless chemical-
specific biomagnification data support using a multiplier other than 
1.0. The predicted baseline BAF shall be used as the wildlife BAF for 
that chemical.

                           VIII. Final Review

    For both organic and inorganic chemicals, human health and wildlife 
BAFs for both trophic levels shall be reviewed for consistency with all 
available data concerning the bioaccumulation, bioconcentration, and 
metabolism of the chemical. For example, information concerning octanol-
water partitioning, molecular size, or other physicochemical properties 
that might enhance or inhibit bioaccumulation should be considered for 
organic chemicals. BAFs derived in accordance with this methodology 
should be modified if changes are justified by available data.

      Appendix C to Part 132--Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative 
    Methodologies for Development of Human Health Criteria and Values

    Great Lakes States and Tribes shall adopt provisions consistent with 
(as protective as) this appendix.

                             I. Introduction

    Great Lakes States and Tribes shall adopt provisions consistent with 
this appendix C to ensure protection of human health.
    A. Goal. The goal of the human health criteria for the Great Lakes 
System is the protection of humans from unacceptable exposure to 
toxicants via consumption of contaminated fish and drinking water and 
from ingesting water as a result of participation in water-oriented 
recreational activities.
    B. Definitions.
    Acceptable daily exposure (ADE). An estimate of the maximum daily 
dose of a substance which is not expected to result in adverse noncancer 
effects to the general human population, including sensitive subgroups.
    Adverse effect. Any deleterious effect to organisms due to exposure 
to a substance. This includes effects which are or may become 
debilitating, harmful or toxic to the normal

[[Page 671]]

functions of the organism, but does not include non-harmful effects such 
as tissue discoloration alone or the induction of enzymes involved in 
the metabolism of the substance.
    Carcinogen. A substance which causes an increased incidence of 
benign or malignant neoplasms, or substantially decreases the time to 
develop neoplasms, in animals or humans. The classification of 
carcinogens is discussed in section II.A of appendix C to part 132.
    Human cancer criterion (HCC). A Human Cancer Value (HCV) for a 
pollutant that meets the minimum data requirements for Tier I specified 
in appendix C.
    Human cancer value (HCV). The maximum ambient water concentration of 
a substance at which a lifetime of exposure from either: drinking the 
water, consuming fish from the water, and water-related recreation 
activities; or consuming fish from the water, and water-related 
recreation activities, will represent a plausible upper-bound risk of 
contracting cancer of one in 100,000 using the exposure assumptions 
specified in the Methodologies for the Development of Human Health 
Criteria and Values in appendix C of this part.
    Human noncancer criterion (HNC). A Human Noncancer Value (HNV) for a 
pollutant that meets the minimum data requirements for Tier I specified 
in appendix C of this part.
    Human noncancer value (HNV). The maximum ambient water concentration 
of a substance at which adverse noncancer effects are not likely to 
occur in the human population from lifetime exposure via either: 
drinking the water, consuming fish from the water, and water-related 
recreation activities; or consuming fish from the water, and water-
related recreation activities using the Methodologies for the 
Development of Human Health criteria and Values in appendix C of this 
part.
    Linearized multi-stage model. A conservative mathematical model for 
cancer risk assessment. This model fits linear dose-response curves to 
low doses. It is consistent with a no-threshold model of carcinogenesis, 
i.e., exposure to even a very small amount of the substance is assumed 
to produce a finite increased risk of cancer.
    Lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL). The lowest tested dose 
or concentration of a substance which resulted in an observed adverse 
effect in exposed test organisms when all higher doses or concentrations 
resulted in the same or more severe effects.
    No observed adverse effect level (NOAEL). The highest tested dose or 
concentration of a substance which resulted in no observed adverse 
effect in exposed test organisms where higher doses or concentrations 
resulted in an adverse effect.
    Quantitative structure activity relationship (OSAR) or structure 
activity relationship (SAR). A mathematical relationship between a 
property (activity) of a chemical and a number of descriptors of the 
chemical. These descriptors are chemical or physical characteristics 
obtained experimentally or predicted from the structure of the chemical.
    Relative source contribution (RSC). The factor (percentage) used in 
calculating an HNV or HNC to account for all sources of exposure to a 
contaminant. The RSC reflects the percent of total exposure which can be 
attributed to surface water through water intake and fish consumption.
    Risk associated dose (RAD). A dose of a known or presumed 
carcinogenic substance in (mg/kg/day) which, over a lifetime of 
exposure, is estimated to be associated with a plausible upper bound 
incremental cancer risk equal to one in 100,000.
    Slope factor. Also known as q<INF>1*, slope factor is the 
incremental rate of cancer development calculated through use of a 
linearized multistage model or other appropriate model. It is expressed 
in (mg/kg/day) of exposure to the chemical in question.
    Threshold effect. An effect of a substance for which there is a 
theoretical or empirically established dose or concentration below which 
the effect does not occur.
    Uncertainty factor (UF). One of several numeric factors used in 
operationally deriving criteria from experimental data to account for 
the quality or quantity of the available data.
    C. Level of Protection. The criteria developed shall provide a level 
of protection likely to be without appreciable risk of carcinogenic and/
or noncarcinogenic effects. Criteria are a function of the level of 
designated risk or no adverse effect estimation, selection of data and 
exposure assumptions. Ambient criteria for single carcinogens shall not 
be set at a level representing a lifetime upper-bound incremental risk 
greater than one in 100,000 of developing cancer using the hazard 
assessment techniques and exposure assumptions described herein. 
Criteria affording protection from noncarcinogenic effects shall be 
established at levels that, taking into account uncertainties, are 
considered likely to be without an appreciable risk of adverse human 
health effects (i.e., acute, subchronic and chronic toxicity including 
reproductive and developmental effects) during a lifetime of exposure, 
using the risk assessment techniques and exposure assumptions described 
herein.
    D. Two-tiered Classification. Chemical concentration levels in 
surface water protective of human health shall be derived based on 
either a Tier I or Tier II classification. The two Tiers are primarily 
distinguished by the amount of toxicity data available for deriving the 
concentration levels and the quantity and quality of data on 
bioaccumulation.

[[Page 672]]

                      II. Minimum Data Requirements

    The best available toxicity data on the adverse health effects of a 
chemical and the best data on bioaccumulation factors shall be used when 
developing human health Tier I criteria or Tier II values. The best 
available toxicity data shall include data from well-conducted 
epidemiologic and/or animal studies which provide, in the case of 
carcinogens, an adequate weight of evidence of potential human 
carcinogenicity and, in the case of noncarcinogens, a dose-response 
relationship involving critical effects biologically relevant to humans. 
Such information should be obtained from the EPA Integrated Risk 
Information System (IRIS) database, the scientific literature, and other 
informational databases, studies and/or reports containing adverse 
health effects data of adequate quality for use in this procedure. 
Strong consideration shall be given to the most currently available 
guidance provided by IRIS in deriving criteria or values, supplemented 
with any recent data not incorporated into IRIS. When deviations from 
IRIS are anticipated or considered necessary, it is strongly recommended 
that such actions be communicated to the EPA Reference Dose (RfD) and/or 
the Cancer Risk Assessment Verification Endeavor (CRAVE) workgroup 
immediately. The best available bioaccumulation data shall include data 
from field studies and well-conducted laboratory studies.
    A. Carcinogens. Tier I criteria and Tier II values shall be derived 
using the methodologies described in section III.A of this appendix when 
there is adequate evidence of potential human carcinogenic effects for a 
chemical. It is strongly recommended that the EPA classification system 
for chemical carcinogens, which is described in the 1986 EPA Guidelines 
for Carcinogenic Risk Assessment (U.S. EPA, 1986), or future 
modifications thereto, be used in determining whether adequate evidence 
of potential carcinogenic effects exists. Carcinogens are classified, 
depending on the weight of evidence, as either human carcinogens, 
probable human carcinogens, or possible human carcinogens. The human 
evidence is considered inadequate and therefore the chemical cannot be 
classified as a human carcinogen, if one of two conditions exists: (a) 
there are few pertinent data, or (b) the available studies, while 
showing evidence of association, do not exclude chance, bias, or 
confounding and therefore a casual interpretation is not credible. The 
animal evidence is considered inadequate, and therefore the chemical 
cannot be classified as a probable or possible human carcinogen, when, 
because of major qualitative or quantitative limitations, the evidence 
cannot be interpreted as showing either the presence or absence of a 
carcinogenic effect.
    Chemicals are described as ``human carcinogens'' when there is 
sufficient evidence from epidemiological studies to support a causal 
association between exposure to the chemicals and cancer. Chemicals 
described as ``probable human carcinogens'' include chemicals for which 
the weight of evidence of human carcinogenicity based on epidemiological 
studies is limited. Limited human evidence is that which indicates that 
a causal interpretation is credible, but that alternative explanations, 
such as chance, bias, or confounding, cannot adequately be excluded. 
Probable human carcinogens are also agents for which there is sufficient 
evidence from animal studies and for which there is inadequate evidence 
or no data from epidemiologic studies. Sufficient animal evidence is 
data which indicates that there is an increased incidence of malignant 
tumors or combined malignant and benign tumors: (a) in multiple species 
or strains; (b) in multiple experiments (e.g., with different routes of 
administration or using different dose levels); or (c) to an unusual 
degree in a single experiment with regard to high incidence, unusual 
site or type of tumor, or early age at onset. Additional evidence may be 
provided by data on dose-response effects, as well as information from 
short-term tests (such as mutagenicity/genotoxicity tests which help 
determine whether the chemical interacts directly with DNA) or on 
chemical structure, metabolism or mode of action.
    ``Possible human carcinogens'' are chemicals with limited evidence 
of carcinogenicity in animals in the absence of human data. Limited 
animal evidence is defined as data which suggests a carcinogenic effect 
but are limited because: (a) The studies involve a single species, 
strain, or experiment and do not meet criteria for sufficient evidence 
(see preceding paragraph); or (b) the experiments are restricted by 
inadequate dosage levels, inadequate duration of exposure to the agent, 
inadequate period of follow-up, poor survival, too few animals, or 
inadequate reporting; or (c) the studies indicate an increase in the 
incidence of benign tumors only. More specifically, this group can 
include a wide variety of evidence, e.g., (a) a malignant tumor response 
in a single well-conducted experiment that does not meet conditions for 
sufficient evidence, (b) tumor response of marginal statistical 
significance in studies having inadequate design or reporting, (c) 
benign but not malignant tumors with an agent showing no response in a 
variety of short-term tests for mutagenicity, and (d) response of 
marginal statistical significance in a tissue known to have a high or 
variable background rate.
    1. Tier I: Weight of evidence of potential human carcinogenic 
effects sufficient to derive a Tier I HCC shall generally include human 
carcinogens, probable human carcinogens and can include, on a case-by-
case

[[Page 673]]

basis, possible human carcinogens if studies have been well-conducted 
albeit based on limited evidence, when compared to studies used in 
classifying human and probable human carcinogens. The decision to use 
data on a possible human carcinogen for deriving Tier I criteria shall 
be a case-by-case determination. In determining whether to derive a Tier 
I HCC, additional evidence that shall be considered includes but is not 
limited to available information on mode of action, such as 
mutagenicity/genotoxicity (determinations of whether the chemical 
interacts directly with DNA), structure activity, and metabolism.
    2. Tier II: Weight of evidence of possible human carcinogenic 
effects sufficient to derive a Tier II human cancer value shall include 
those possible human carcinogens for which there are at a minimum, data 
sufficient for quantitative risk assessment, but for which data are 
inadequate for Tier I criterion development due to a tumor response of 
marginal statistical significance or inability to derive a strong dose-
response relationship. In determining whether to derive Tier II human 
cancer values, additional evidence that shall be considered includes but 
is not limited to available information on mode of action such as 
mutagenicity/genotoxicity (determinations of whether the chemical 
interacts directly with DNA), structure activity and metabolism. As with 
the use of data on possible human carcinogens in developing Tier I 
criteria, the decision to use data on possible human carcinogens to 
derive Tier II values shall be made on a case-by-case basis.
    B. Noncarcinogens. All available toxicity data shall be evaluated 
considering the full range of possible health effects of a chemical, 
i.e., acute/subacute, chronic/subchronic and reproductive/developmental 
effects, in order to best describe the dose-response relationship of the 
chemical, and to calculate human noncancer criteria and values which 
will protect against the most sensitive endpoint(s) of toxicity. 
Although it is desirable to have an extensive database which considers a 
wide range of possible adverse effects, this type of data exists for a 
very limited number of chemicals. For many others, there is a range in 
quality and quantity of data available. To assure minimum reliability of 
criteria and values, it is necessary to establish a minimum database 
with which to develop Tier I criteria or Tier II values. The following 
represent the minimum data sets necessary for this procedure.
    1. Tier I: The minimum data set sufficient to derive a Tier I human 
HNC shall include at least one well-conducted epidemiologic study or 
animal study. A well-conducted epidemiologic study for a Tier I HNC must 
quantify exposure level(s) and demonstrate positive association between 
exposure to a chemical and adverse effect(s) in humans. A well-conducted 
study in animals must demonstrate a dose response relationship involving 
one or more critical effect(s) biologically relevant to humans. (For 
example, study results from an animal whose pharmacokinetics and 
toxicokinetics match those of a human would be considered most 
biologically relevant.) Ideally, the duration of a study should span 
multiple generations of exposed test species or at least a major portion 
of the lifespan of one generation. This type of data is currently very 
limited. By the use of uncertainty adjustments, shorter term studies 
(such as 90-day subchronic studies) with evaluation of more limited 
effect(s) may be used to extrapolate to longer exposures or to account 
for a variety of adverse effects. For Tier I criteria developed pursuant 
to this procedure, such a limited study must be conducted for at least 
90 days in rodents or 10 percent of the lifespan of other appropriate 
test species and demonstrate a no observable adverse effect level 
(NOAEL). Chronic studies of one year or longer in rodents or 50 percent 
of the lifespan or greater in other appropriate test species that 
demonstrate a lowest observable adverse effect level (LOAEL) may be 
sufficient for use in Tier I criterion derivation if the effects 
observed at the LOAEL were relatively mild and reversible as compared to 
effects at higher doses. This does not preclude the use of a LOAEL from 
a study (of chronic duration) with only one or two doses if the effects 
observed appear minimal when compared to effect levels observed at 
higher doses in other studies.
    2. Tier II: When the minimum data for deriving Tier I criteria are 
not available to meet the Tier I data requirements, a more limited 
database may be considered for deriving Tier II values. As with Tier I 
criteria, all available data shall be considered and ideally should 
address a range of adverse health effects with exposure over a 
substantial portion of the lifespan (or multiple generations) of the 
test species. When such data are lacking it may be necessary to rely on 
less extensive data in order to establish a Tier II value. With the use 
of appropriate uncertainty factors to account for a less extensive 
database, the minimum data sufficient to derive a Tier II value shall 
include a NOAEL from at least one well-conducted short-term repeated 
dose study. This study shall be of at least 28 days duration, in animals 
demonstrating a dose-response, and involving effects biologically 
relevant to humans. Data from studies of longer duration (greater than 
28 days) and LOAELs from such studies (greater than 28 days) may be more 
appropriate in some cases for derivation of Tier II values. Use of a 
LOAEL should be based on consideration of the following information: 
severity of effect, quality of the study and duration of the study.
    C. Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs).

[[Page 674]]

    1. Tier I for Carcinogens and Noncarcinogens: To be considered a 
Tier I cancer or noncancer human health criterion, along with satisfying 
the minimum toxicity data requirements of sections II.A.1 and II.B.1 of 
this appendix, a chemical must have the following minimum 
bioaccumulation data. For all organic chemicals either: (a) a field-
measured BAF; (b) a BAF derived using the BSAF methodology; or (c) a 
chemical with a BAF less than 125 regardless of how the BAF was derived. 
For all inorganic chemicals, including organometals such as mercury, 
either: (a) a field-measured BAF or (b) a laboratory-measured BCF.
    2. Tier II for Carcinogens and Noncarcinogens: A chemical is 
considered a Tier II cancer or noncancer human health value if it does 
not meet either the minimum toxicity data requirements of sections 
II.A.1 and II.B.1 of this appendix or the minimum bioaccumulation data 
requirements of section II.C.1 of this appendix.

  III. Principles for Development of Tier I Criteria or Tier II Values

    The fundamental components of the procedure to calculate Tier I 
criteria or Tier II values are the same. However, certain of the aspects 
of the procedure designed to account for short-duration studies or other 
limitations in data are more likely to be relevant in deriving Tier II 
values than Tier I criteria.
    A. Carcinogens.
    1. A non-threshold mechanism of carcinogenesis shall be assumed 
unless biological data adequately demonstrate the existence of a 
threshold on a chemical-specific basis.
    2. All appropriate human epidemiologic data and animal cancer 
bioassay data shall be considered. Data specific to an environmentally 
appropriate route of exposure shall be used. Oral exposure should be 
used preferentially over dermal and inhalation since, in most cases, the 
exposure routes of greatest concern are fish consumption and drinking 
water/incidental ingestion. The risk associated dose shall be set at a 
level corresponding to an incremental cancer risk of one in 100,000. If 
acceptable human epidemiologic data are available for a chemical, it 
shall be used to derive the risk associated dose. If acceptable human 
epidemiologic data are not available, the risk associated dose shall be 
derived from available animal bioassay data. Data from a species that is 
considered most biologically relevant to humans (i.e., responds most 
like humans) is preferred where all other considerations regarding 
quality of data are equal. In the absence of data to distinguish the 
most relevant species, data from the most sensitive species tested, 
i.e., the species showing a carcinogenic effect at the lowest 
administered dose, shall generally be used.
    3. When animal bioassay data are used and a non-threshold mechanism 
of carcinogenicity is assumed, the data are fitted to a linearized 
multistage computer model (e.g., Global '86 or equivalent model). Global 
'86 is the linearized multistage model, derived by Howe, Crump and Van 
Landingham (1986), which EPA uses to determine cancer potencies. The 
upper-bound 95 percent confidence limit on risk (or, the lower 95 
percent confidence limit on dose) at the one in 100,000 risk level shall 
be used to calculate a risk associated dose (RAD). Other models, 
including modifications or variations of the linear multistage model 
which are more appropriate to the available data may be used where 
scientifically justified.
    4. If the duration of the study is significantly less than the 
natural lifespan of the test animal, the slope may be adjusted on a 
case-by-case basis to compensate for latent tumors which were not 
expressed (e.g., U.S. EPA, 1980) In the absence of alternative 
approaches which compensate for study durations significantly less than 
lifetime, the permitting authority may use the process described in the 
1980 National Guidelines (see 45 FR 79352).
    5. A species scaling factor shall be used to account for differences 
between test species and humans. It shall be assumed that milligrams per 
surface area per day is an equivalent dose between species (U.S. EPA, 
1986). All doses presented in mg/kg bodyweight will be converted to an 
equivalent surface area dose by raising the mg/kg dose to the 2/3 power. 
However, if adequate pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies are 
available, these data may be factored into the adjustment for species 
differences on a case-by-case basis.
    6. Additional data selection and adjustment decisions must also be 
made in the process of quantifying risk. Consideration must be given to 
tumor selection for modeling, e.g., pooling estimates for multiple tumor 
types and identifying and combining benign and malignant tumors. All 
doses shall be adjusted to give an average daily dose over the study 
duration. Adjustments in the rate of tumor response must be made for 
early mortality in test species. The goodness-of-fit of the model to the 
data must also be assessed.
    7. When a linear, non-threshold dose response relationship is 
assumed, the RAD shall be calculated using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR95.114

Where:

RAD=risk associated dose in milligrams of toxicant per kilogram body 
          weight per day (mg/kg/day).

[[Page 675]]

0.00001 (1 x 10<SUP>-5)=incremental risk of developing cancer equal to 
          one in 100,000.
q<INF>1*=slope factor (mg/kg/day)<SUP>-1.

    8. If human epidemiologic data and/or other biological data (animal) 
indicate that a chemical causes cancer via a threshold mechanism, the 
risk associated dose may, on a case-by-case basis, be calculated using a 
method which assumes a threshold mechanism is operative.
    B. Noncarcinogens.
    1. Noncarcinogens shall generally be assumed to have a threshold 
dose or concentration below which no adverse effects should be observed. 
Therefore, the Tier I criterion or Tier II value is the maximum water 
concentration of a substance at or below which a lifetime exposure from 
drinking the water, consuming fish caught in the water, and ingesting 
water as a result of participating in water-related recreation 
activities is likely to be without appreciable risk of deleterious 
effects.
    For some noncarcinogens, there may not be a threshold dose below 
which no adverse effects should be observed. Chemicals acting as 
genotoxic teratogens and germline mutagens are thought to possibly 
produce reproductive and/or developmental effects via a genetically 
linked mechanism which may have no threshold. Other chemicals also may 
not demonstrate a threshold. Criteria for these types of chemicals will 
be established on a case-by-case basis using appropriate assumptions 
reflecting the likelihood that no threshold exists.
    2. All appropriate human and animal toxicologic data shall be 
reviewed and evaluated. To the maximum extent possible, data most 
specific to the environmentally relevant route of exposure shall be 
used. Oral exposure data should be used preferentially over dermal and 
inhalation since, in most cases, the exposure routes of greatest concern 
are fish consumption and drinking water/incidental ingestion. When 
acceptable human data are not available (e.g., well-conducted 
epidemiologic studies), animal data from species most biologically 
relevant to humans shall be used. In the absence of data to distinguish 
the most relevant species, data from the most sensitive animal species 
tested, i.e., the species showing a toxic effect at the lowest 
administered dose (given a relevant route of exposure), should generally 
be used.
    3. Minimum data requirements are specified in section II.B of this 
appendix. The experimental exposure level representing the highest level 
tested at which no adverse effects were demonstrated (NOAEL) from 
studies satisfying the provisions of section II.B of this appendix shall 
be used for criteria calculations. In the absence of a NOAEL, the LOAEL 
from studies satisfying the provisions of section II.B of this appendix 
may be used if it is based on relatively mild and reversible effects.
    4. Uncertainty factors shall be used to account for the 
uncertainties in predicting acceptable dose levels for the general human 
population based upon experimental animal data or limited human data.
    a. An uncertainty factor of 10 shall generally be used when 
extrapolating from valid experimental results from studies on prolonged 
exposure to average healthy humans. This 10-fold factor is used to 
protect sensitive members of the human population.
    b. An uncertainty factor of 100 shall generally be used when 
extrapolating from valid results of long-term studies on experimental 
animals when results of studies of human exposure are not available or 
are inadequate. In comparison to a, above, this represents an additional 
10-fold uncertainty factor in extrapolating data from the average animal 
to the average human.
    c. An uncertainty factor of up to 1000 shall generally be used when 
extrapolating from animal studies for which the exposure duration is 
less than chronic, but greater than subchronic (e.g., 90 days or more in 
length), or when other significant deficiencies in study quality are 
present, and when useful long-term human data are not available. In 
comparison to b, above, this represents an additional UF of up to 10-
fold for less than chronic, but greater than subchronic, studies.
    d. An UF of up to 3000 shall generally be used when extrapolating 
from animal studies for which the exposure duration is less than 
subchronic (e.g., 28 days). In comparison to b above, this represents an 
additional UF of up to 30-fold for less than subchronic studies (e.g., 
28-day). The level of additional uncertainty applied for less than 
chronic exposures depends on the duration of the study used relative to 
the lifetime of the experimental animal.
    e. An additional UF of between one and ten may be used when deriving 
a criterion from a LOAEL. This UF accounts for the lack of an 
identifiable NOAEL. The level of additional uncertainty applied may 
depend upon the severity and the incidence of the observed adverse 
effect.
    f. An additional UF of between one and ten may be applied when there 
are limited effects data or incomplete sub-acute or chronic toxicity 
data (e.g., reproductive/developmental data). The level of quality and 
quantity of the experimental data available as well as structure-
activity relationships may be used to determine the factor selected.
    g. When deriving an UF in developing a Tier I criterion or Tier II 
value, the total uncertainty, as calculated following the guidance of 
sections 4.a through f, cited above, shall not exceed 10,000 for Tier I 
criteria and 30,000 for Tier II values.

[[Page 676]]

    5. All study results shall be converted, as necessary, to the 
standard unit for acceptable daily exposure of milligrams of toxicant 
per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg/day). Doses shall be adjusted 
for continuous exposure (i.e., seven days/week, 24 hours/day, etc.).
    C. Criteria and Value Derivation.
    1. Standard Exposure Assumptions. The following represent the 
standard exposure assumptions used to calculate Tier I criteria and Tier 
II values for carcinogens and noncarcinogens. Higher levels of exposure 
may be assumed by States and Tribes pursuant to Clean Water Act (CWA) 
section 510, or where appropriate in deriving site-specific criteria 
pursuant to procedure 1 in appendix F to part 132.
    BW = body weight of an average human (BW = 70kg).
    WC<INF>d = per capita water consumption (both drinking and 
incidental exposure) for surface waters classified as public water 
supplies = two liters/day.
          --or--
    WC<INF>r = per capita incidental daily water ingestion for surface 
waters not used as human drinking water sources = 0.01 liters/day.
    FC = per capita daily consumption of regionally caught freshwater 
fish = 0.015kg/day (0.0036 kg/day for trophic level 3 and 0.0114 kg/day 
for trophic level 4).
    BAF = bioaccumulation factor for trophic level 3 and trophic level 
4, as derived using the BAF methodology in appendix B to part 132.
    2. Carcinogens. The Tier I human cancer criteria or Tier II values 
shall be calculated as follows:

RAD=Risk associated dose in milligrams toxicant per kilogram body weight 
          per day (mg/kg/day) that is associated with a lifetime 
          incremental cancer risk equal to one in 100,000.
BW=weight of an average human (BW=70 kg).
WC<INF>d=per capita water consumption (both drinking and incidental 
          exposure) for surface waters classified as public water 
          supplies=two liters/day.
      or
WC<INF>r=per capita incidental daily water ingestion for surface waters 
          not used as human drinking water sources=0.01 liters/day.
FC<INF>TL3=mean consumption of trophic level 3 of regionally caught 
          freshwater fish=0.0036 kg/day.
FC<INF>TL4=mean consumption of trophic level 4 of regionally caught 
          freshwater fish=0.0114 kg/day.
BAF<SUP>HH<INF>TL3=bioaccumulation factor for trophic level 3 fish, as 
          derived using the BAF methodology in appendix B to part 132.
BAF<SUP>HH<INF>TL4=bioaccumulation factor for trophic level 4 fish, as 
          derived using the BAF methodology in appendix B to part 132.

    3. Noncarcinogens. The Tier I human noncancer criteria or Tier II 
values shall be calculated as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR95.116

Where:

HNV=Human noncancer value in milligrams per liter (mg/L).
ADE=Acceptable daily exposure in milligrams toxicant per kilogram body 
          weight per day (mg/kg/day).
RSC=Relative source contribution factor of 0.8. An RSC derived from 
          actual exposure data may be developed using the methodology 
          outlined by the 1980 National Guidelines (see 45 FR 79354).
BW=weight of an average human (BW=70 kg).

[[Page 677]]

WC<INF>d=per capita water consumption (both drinking and incidental 
          exposure) for surface waters classified as public water 
          supplies=two liters/day.

Appendix D to Part 132--Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative Methodology 
                for the Development of Wildlife Criteria

    Great Lakes States and Tribes shall adopt provisions consistent with 
(as protective as) this appendix.

                             I. Introduction

    A. A Great Lakes Water Quality Wildlife Criterion (GLWC) is the 
concentration of a substance which is likely to, if not exceeded, 
protect avian and mammalian wildlife populations inhabiting the Great 
Lakes basin from adverse effects resulting from the ingestion of water 
and aquatic prey taken from surface waters of the Great Lakes System. 
These criteria are based on existing toxicological studies of the 
substance of concern and quantitative information about the exposure of 
wildlife species to the substance (i.e., food and water consumption 
rates). Since toxicological and exposure data for individual wildlife 
species are limited, a GLWC is derived using a methodology similar to 
that used to derive noncancer human health criteria (Barnes and Dourson, 
1988; NAS, 1977; NAS, 1980; U.S. EPA, 1980). Separate avian and 
mammalian values are developed using taxonomic class-specific toxicity 
data and exposure data for five representative Great Lakes basin 
wildlife species. The wildlife species selected are representative of 
avian and mammalian species resident in the Great Lakes basin which are 
likely to experience the highest exposures to bioaccumulative 
contaminants through the aquatic food web; they are the bald eagle, 
herring gull, belted kingfisher, mink, and river otter.
    B. This appendix establishes a methodology which is required when 
developing Tier I wildlife criteria for bioaccumulative chemicals of 
concern (BCCs). The use of the equation provided in the methodology is 
encouraged, but not required, for the development of Tier I criteria or 
Tier II values for pollutants other than those identified in Table 6-A 
for which Tier I criteria or Tier II values are determined to be 
necessary for the protection of wildlife in the Great Lakes basin. A 
discussion of the methodology for deriving Tier II values can be found 
in the Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative Technical Support Document 
for Wildlife Criteria (Wildlife TSD).
    C. In the event that this methodology is used to develop criteria 
for pollutants other than BCCs, or in the event that the Tier II 
methodology described in the Wildlife TSD is used to derive Tier II 
values, the methodology for deriving bioaccumulation factors under 
appendix B to part 132 must be used in either derivation. For chemicals 
which do not biomagnify to the extent of BCCs, it may be appropriate to 
select different representative species which are better examples of 
species with the highest exposures for the given chemical. The equation 
presented in this methodology, however, is still encouraged. In 
addition, procedure 1 of appendix F of this part describes the 
procedures for calculating site-specific wildlife criteria.
    D. The term ``wildlife value'' (WV) is used to denote the value for 
each representative species which results from using the equation 
presented below, the value obtained from averaging species values within 
a class, or any value derived from application of the site-specific 
procedure provided in procedure 1 of appendix F of this part. The WVs 
calculated for the representative species are used to calculate 
taxonomic class-specific WVs. The WV is the concentration of a substance 
which, if not exceeded, should better protect the taxon in question.

[[Page 678]]

    E. ``Tier I wildlife criterion,'' or ``Tier I criterion'' is used to 
denote the number derived from data meeting the Tier I minimum database 
requirements, and which will be protective of the two classes of 
wildlife. It is synonymous with the term ``GLWC,'' and the two are used 
interchangeably.

         II. Calculation of Wildlife Values for Tier I Criteria

    Table 4 of Part 132 and Table D-1 of this appendix contain criteria 
calculated by EPA using the methodology provided below.
    A. Equation for Avian and Mammalian Wildlife Values. Tier I wildlife 
values for the pollutants designated BCCs pursuant to part 132 are to be 
calculated using the equation presented below.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR95.117

Where:
WV=Wildlife Value in milligrams of substance per liter (mg/L).
TD=Test Dose (TD) in milligrams of substance per kilograms per day (mg/
          kg-d) for the test species. This shall be either a NOAEL or a 
          LOAEL.
UF<INF>A=Uncertainty Factor (UF) for extrapolating toxicity data across 
          species (unitless). A species-specific UF shall be selected 
          and applied to each representative species, consistent with 
          the equation.
UF<INF>S=UF for extrapolating from subchronic to chronic exposures 
          (unitless).
UF<INF>L=UF for LOAEL to NOAEL extrapolations (unitless).
Wt=Average weight in kilograms (kg) for the representative species.
W=Average daily volume of water consumed in liters per day (L/d) by the 
          representative species.
F<INF>TLi=Average daily amount of food consumed from trophic level i in 
          kilograms per day (kg/d) by the representative species.
BAF<SUP>WL<INF>TLi=Bioaccumulation factor (BAF) for wildlife food in 
          trophic level i in liters per kilogram (L/kg), developed using 
          the BAF methodology in appendix B to part 132, Methodology for 
          Development of Bioaccumulation Factors. For consumption of 
          piscivorous birds by other birds (e.g., herring gull by 
          eagles), the BAF is derived by multiplying the trophic level 3 
          BAF for fish by a biomagnification factor to account for the 
          biomagnification from fish to the consumed birds.

    B. Identification of Representative Species for Protection. For 
bioaccumulative chemicals, piscivorous species are identified as the 
focus of concern for wildlife criteria development in the Great Lakes. 
An analysis of known or estimated exposure components for avian and 
mammalian wildlife species is presented in the Wildlife TSD. This 
analysis identifies three avian species (eagle, kingfisher and herring 
gull) and two mammalian species (mink and otter) as representative 
species for protection. The TD obtained from toxicity data for each 
taxonomic class is used to calculate WVs for each of the five 
representative species.
    C. Calculation of Avian and Mammalian Wildlife Values and GLWC 
Derivation. The avian WV is the geometric mean of the WVs calculated for 
the three representative avian species. The mammalian WV is the 
geometric mean of the WVs calculated for the two representative 
mammalian species. The lower of the mammalian and avian WVs must be 
selected as the GLWC.

    III. Parameters of the Effect Component of the Wildlife Criteria 
                               Methodology

    A. Definitions. The following definitions provide additional 
specificity and guidance in the evaluation of toxicity data and the 
application of this methodology.
    Acceptable endpoints. For the purpose of wildlife criteria 
derivation, acceptable subchronic and chronic endpoints are those which 
affect reproductive or developmental success, organismal viability or 
growth, or any other endpoint which is, or is directly related to, 
parameters that influence population dynamics.
    Chronic effect. An adverse effect that is measured by assessing an 
acceptable endpoint, and results from continual exposure over several 
generations, or at least over a significant part of the test species' 
projected life span or life stage.
    Lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL). The lowest tested dose 
or concentration of a substance which resulted in an observed adverse 
effect in exposed test organisms when all higher doses or concentrations 
resulted in the same or more severe effects.
    No-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL). The highest tested dose or 
concentration of a substance which resulted in no observed adverse 
effect in exposed test organisms where higher doses or concentrations 
resulted in an adverse effect.
    Subchronic effect. An adverse effect, measured by assessing an 
acceptable endpoint, resulting from continual exposure for a period of 
time less than that deemed necessary for a chronic test.
    B. Minimum Toxicity Database for Tier I Criteria Development. A TD 
value is required for criterion calculation. To derive a Tier I 
criterion for wildlife, the data set shall provide enough data to 
generate a subchronic or chronic dose-response curve for any given 
substance for both mammalian and avian

[[Page 679]]

species. In reviewing the toxicity data available which meet the minimum 
data requirements for each taxonomic class, the following order of 
preference shall be applied to select the appropriate TD to be used for 
calculation of individual WVs. Data from peer-reviewed field studies of 
wildlife species take precedence over other types of studies, where such 
studies are of adequate quality. An acceptable field study must be of 
subchronic or chronic duration, provide a defensible, chemical-specific 
dose-response curve in which cause and effect are clearly established, 
and assess acceptable endpoints as defined in this document. When 
acceptable wildlife field studies are not available, or determined to be 
of inadequate quality, the needed toxicity information may come from 
peer-reviewed laboratory studies. When laboratory studies are used, 
preference shall be given to laboratory studies with wildlife species 
over traditional laboratory animals to reduce uncertainties in making 
interspecies extrapolations. All available laboratory data and field 
studies shall be reviewed to corroborate the final GLWC, to assess the 
reasonableness of the toxicity value used, and to assess the 
appropriateness of any UFs which are applied. When evaluating the 
studies from which a test dose is derived in general, the following 
requirements must be met:
    1. The mammalian data must come from at least one well-conducted 
study of 90 days or greater designed to observe subchronic or chronic 
effects as defined in this document.
    2. The avian data must come from at least one well-conducted study 
of 70 days or greater designed to observe subchronic or chronic effects 
as defined in this document.
    3. In reviewing the studies from which a TD is derived for use in 
calculating a WV, studies involving exposure routes other than oral may 
be considered only when an equivalent oral daily dose can be estimated 
and technically justified because the criteria calculations are based on 
an oral route of exposure.
    4. In assessing the studies which meet the minimum data 
requirements, preference should be given to studies which assess effects 
on developmental or reproductive endpoints because, in general, these 
are more important endpoints in ensuring that a population's 
productivity is maintained. The Wildlife TSD provides additional 
discussion on the selection of an appropriate toxicity study.
    C. Selection of TD Data. In selecting data to be used in the 
derivation of WVs, the evaluation of acceptable endpoints, as defined in 
Section III.A of this appendix, will be the primary selection criterion. 
All data not part of the selected subset may be used to assess the 
reasonableness of the toxicity value and the appropriateness of the Ufs 
which are applied.
    1. If more than one TD value is available within a taxonomic class, 
based on different endpoints of toxicity, that TD, which is likely to 
reflect best potential impacts to wildlife populations through resultant 
changes in mortality or fecundity rates, shall be used for the 
calculation of WVs.
    2. If more than one TD is available within a taxonomic class, based 
on the same endpoint of toxicity, the TD from the most sensitive species 
shall be used.
    3. If more than one TD based on the same endpoint of toxicity is 
available for a given species, the TD for that species shall be 
calculated using the geometric mean of those TDs.
    D. Exposure Assumptions in the Determination of the TD. 1. In those 
cases in which a TD is available in units other than milligrams of 
substance per kilograms per day (mg/kg/d), the following procedures 
shall be used to convert the TD to the appropriate units prior to 
calculating a WV.
    2. If the TD is given in milligrams of toxicant per liter of water 
consumed by the test animals (mg/L), the TD shall be multiplied by the 
daily average volume of water consumed by the test animals in liters per 
day (L/d) and divided by the average weight of the test animals in 
kilograms (kg).
    3. If the TD is given in milligrams of toxicant per kilogram of food 
consumed by the test animals (mg/kg), the TD shall be multiplied by the 
average amount of food in kilograms consumed daily by the test animals 
(kg/d) and divided by the average weight of the test animals in 
kilograms (kg).
    E. Drinking and Feeding Rates. 1. When drinking and feeding rates 
and body weight are needed to express the TD in milligrams of substance 
per kilograms per day (mg/kg/d), they are obtained from the study from 
which the TD was derived. If not already determined, body weight, and 
drinking and feeding rates are to be converted to a wet weight basis.
    2. If the study does not provide the needed values, the values shall 
be determined from appropriate scientific literature. For studies done 
with domestic laboratory animals, either the Registry of Toxic Effects 
of Chemical Substances (National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health, the latest edition, Cincinnati, OH), or Recommendations for and 
Documentation of Biological Values for Use in Risk Assessment (U.S. EPA, 
1988) should be consulted. When these references do not contain exposure 
information for the species used in a given study, either the allometric 
equations from Calder and Braun (1983) and Nagy (1987), which are 
presented below, or the exposure estimation methods presented in Chapter 
4 of the Wildlife Exposure Factors Handbook (U.S. EPA, 1993), should be 
applied to approximate the needed feeding or drinking rates. Additional 
discussion and recommendations are provided in

[[Page 680]]

the Wildlife TSD. The choice of the methods described above is at the 
discretion of the State or Tribe.
    3. For mammalian species, the general allometric equations are:

    a. F = 0.0687  x  (Wt)<SUP>0.82

Where:

F = Feeding rate of mammalian species in kilograms per day (kg/d) dry 
          weight.
Wt = Average weight in kilograms (kg) of the test animals.

    b. W = 0.099  x  (Wt)<SUP>0.90

Where:

W = Drinking rate of mammalian species in liters per day (L/d).
 Wt = Average weight in kilograms (kg) of the test animals.
    4. For avian species, the general allometric equations are:

    a. F = 0.0582 (Wt)<SUP>0.65

Where:

F = Feeding rate of avian species in kilograms per day (kg/d) dry 
          weight.
Wt = Average weight in kilograms (kg) of the test animals.

    b. W = 0.059  x  (Wt)<SUP>0.67

Where:

W = Drinking rate of avian species in liters per day (L/d).
Wt = Average weight in kilograms (kg) of the test animals.
    F. LOAEL to NOAEL Extrapolations (UF<INF>L). In those cases in which 
a NOAEL is unavailable as the TD and a LOAEL is available, the LOAEL may 
be used to estimate the NOAEL. If used, the LOAEL shall be divided by an 
UF to estimate a NOAEL for use in deriving WVs. The value of the UF 
shall not be less than one and should not exceed 10, depending on the 
dose-response curve and any other available data, and is represented by 
UF<INF>L in the equation expressed in Section II.A of this appendix. 
Guidance for selecting an appropriate UF<INF>L, based on a review of 
available wildlife toxicity data, is available in the Wildlife TSD.
    G. Subchronic to Chronic Extrapolations (US<INF>S). In instances 
where only subchronic data are available, the TD may be derived from 
subchronic data. In such cases, the TD shall be divided by an UF to 
extrapolate from subchronic to chronic levels. The value of the UF shall 
not be less than one and should not exceed 10, and is represented by 
UF<INF>S in the equation expressed in Section II.A of this appendix. 
This factor is to be used when assessing highly bioaccumulative 
substances where toxicokinetic considerations suggest that a bioassay of 
limited length underestimates chronic effects. Guidance for selecting an 
appropriate UF<INF>S, based on a review of available wildlife toxicity 
data, is available in the Wildlife TSD.
    H. Interspecies Extrapolations (UF<INF>A). 1. The selection of the 
UF<INF>A shall be based on the available toxicological data and on 
available data concerning the physicochemical, toxicokinetic, and 
toxicodynamic properties of the substance in question and the amount and 
quality of available data. This value is an UF that is intended to 
account for differences in toxicological sensitivity among species. 
Guidance for selecting an appropriate UF<INF>A, based on a review of 
available wildlife toxicity data, is available in the Wildlife TSD. 
Additional discussion of an interspecies UF located in appendix A to the 
Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative Technical Support Document for 
Human Health Criteria may be useful in determining the appropriate value 
for UF<INF>A.
    2. For the derivation of Tier I criteria, a UF<INF>A shall not be 
less than one and should not exceed 100, and shall be applied to each of 
the five representative species, based on existing data and best 
professional judgment. The value of UF<INF>A may differ for each of the 
representative species.
    3. For Tier I wildlife criteria, the UF<INF>A shall be used only for 
extrapolating toxicity data across species within a taxonomic class, 
except as provided below. The Tier I UF<INF>A is not intended for 
interclass extrapolations because of the poorly defined comparative 
toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic parameters between mammals and birds. 
However, an interclass extrapolation employing a UF<INF>A may be used 
for a given chemical if it can be supported by a validated biologically-
based dose-response model or by an analysis of interclass toxicological 
data, considering acceptable endpoints, for a chemical analog that acts 
under the same mode of toxic action.

   IV. Parameters of the Exposure Component of the Wildlife Criteria 
                               Methodology

    A. Drinking and Feeding Rates of Representative Species. The body 
weights (Wt), feeding rates (F<INF>Tli), drinking rates (W), and trophic 
level dietary composition (as food ingestion rate and percent in diet) 
for each of the five representative species are presented in Table D-2 
of this appendix. Guidance on incorporating the non-aquatic portion of 
the bald eagle and mink diets in the criteria calculations is available 
in the Wildlife TSD.
    B. BAFs. The Methodology for Development of Bioaccumulation Factors 
is presented in appendix B to part 132. Trophic level 3 and 4 BAFs are 
used to derive Wvs because these are the trophic levels at which the 
representative species feed.

      Appendix E to Part 132--Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative 
                         Antidegradation Policy

    Great Lakes States and Tribes shall adopt provisions consistent with 
(as protective as) appendix E to part 132.
    The State or Tribe shall adopt an antidegradation standard 
applicable to all waters of the Great Lakes System and identify the 
methods for implementing such a standard. Consistent with 40 CFR 131.12, 
an acceptable antidegradation standard and implementation procedure are 
required elements of a State's or Tribe's water quality standards 
program. Consistent with 40 CFR 131.6, a complete water quality 
standards submission needs to include both an antidegradation standard 
and antidegradation implementation procedures. At a minimum, States and 
Tribes shall adopt provisions in their antidegradation standard and 
implementation methods consistent with sections I, II, III and IV of 
this appendix, applicable to pollutants identified as bioaccumulative 
chemicals of concern (BCCs).

                       I. Antidegradation Standard

    This antidegradation standard shall be applicable to any action or 
activity by any source, point or nonpoint, of pollutants that is 
anticipated to result in an increased loading of BCCs to surface waters 
of the Great Lakes System and for which independent regulatory authority 
exists requiring compliance with water quality standards. Pursuant to 
this standard:
    A. Existing instream water uses, as defined pursuant to 40 CFR 131, 
and the level of water quality necessary to protect existing uses shall 
be maintained and protected. Where designated uses of the waterbody are 
impaired, there shall be no lowering of the water quality with respect 
to the pollutant

[[Page 682]]

or pollutants which are causing the impairment;
    B. Where, for any parameter, the quality of the waters exceed levels 
necessary to support the propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife 
and recreation in and on the waters, that water shall be considered high 
quality for that parameter consistent with the definition of high 
quality water found at section II.A of this appendix and that quality 
shall be maintained and protected unless the State or Tribe finds, after 
full satisfaction of intergovernmental coordination and public 
participation provisions of the State's or Tribe's continuing planning 
process, that allowing lower water quality is necessary to accommodate 
important economic or social development in the area in which the waters 
are located. In allowing such degradation, the State or Tribe shall 
assure water quality adequate to protect existing uses fully. Further, 
the State or Tribe shall assure that there shall be achieved the highest 
statutory and regulatory requirements for all new and existing point 
sources and all cost-effective and reasonable best management practices 
for nonpoint source control. The State or Tribe shall utilize the 
Antidegradation Implementation Procedures adopted pursuant to the 
requirements of this regulation in determining if any lowering of water 
quality will be allowed;
    C. Where high quality waters constitute an outstanding national 
resource, such as waters of national and State parks and wildlife 
refuges and waters of exceptional recreational or ecological 
significance, that water quality shall be maintained and protected; and
    D. In those cases where the potential lowering of water quality is 
associated with a thermal discharge, the decision to allow such 
degradation shall be consistent with section 316 of the Clean Water Act 
(CWA).

              II. Antidegradation Implementation Procedures

    A. Definitions.
    Control Document. Any authorization issued by a State, Tribal or 
Federal agency to any source of pollutants to waters under its 
jurisdiction that specifies conditions under which the source is allowed 
to operate.
    High quality waters. High quality waters are water bodies in which, 
on a parameter by parameter basis, the quality of the waters exceeds 
levels necessary to support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife 
and recreation in and on the water.
    Lake Superior Basin--Outstanding International Resource Waters. 
Those waters designated as such by a Tribe or State consistent with the 
September 1991 Bi-National Program to Restore and Protect the Lake 
Superior Basin. The purpose of such designations shall be to ensure that 
any new or increased discharges of Lake Superior bioaccumulative 
substances of immediate concern are subject to best technology in 
process and treatment requirements.
    Lake Superior Basin--Outstanding National Resource Waters. Those 
waters designated as such by a Tribe or State consistent with the 
September 1991 Bi-National Program to Restore and Protect the Lake 
Superior Basin. The purpose of such designations shall be to prohibit 
new or increased discharges of Lake Superior bioaccumulative substances 
of immediate concern from point sources in these areas.
    Lake Superior bioaccumulative substances of immediate concern. A 
list of substances identified in the September 1991 Bi-National Program 
to Restore and Protect the Lake Superior Basin. They include: 2, 3, 7, 
8-TCDD; octachlorostyrene; hexachlorobenzene; chlordane; DDT, DDE, and 
other metabolites; toxaphene; PCBs; and mercury. Other chemicals may be 
added to the list following States' or Tribes' assessments of 
environmental effects and impacts and after public review and comment.
    Outstanding National Resource Waters. Those waters designated as 
such by a Tribe or State. The State or Tribal designation shall describe 
the quality of such waters to serve as the benchmark of the water 
quality that shall be maintained and protected. Waters that may be 
considered for designation as Outstanding National Resource Waters 
include, but are not limited to, water bodies that are recognized as:
    Important because of protection through official action, such as 
Federal or State law, Presidential or secretarial action, international 
treaty, or interstate compact;
    Having exceptional recreational significance;
    Having exceptional ecological significance;
    Having other special environmental, recreational, or ecological 
attributes; or waters whose designation as Outstanding National Resource 
Waters is reasonably necessary for the protection of other waters so 
designated.
    Significant Lowering of Water Quality. A significant lowering of 
water quality occurs when there is a new or increased loading of any BCC 
from any regulated existing or new facility, either point source or 
nonpoint source for which there is a control document or reviewable 
action, as a result of any activity including, but not limited to:
    (1) Construction of a new regulated facility or modification of an 
existing regulated facility such that a new or modified control document 
is required;
    (2) Modification of an existing regulated facility operating under a 
current control document such that the production capacity of the 
facility is increased;
    (3) Addition of a new source of untreated or pretreated effluent 
containing or expected to contain any BCC to an existing wastewater 
treatment works, whether public or private;

[[Page 683]]

    (4) A request for an increased limit in an applicable control 
document;
    (5) Other deliberate activities that, based on the information 
available, could be reasonably expected to result in an increased 
loading of any BCC to any waters of the Great Lakes System.
    b. Notwithstanding the above, changes in loadings of any BCC within 
the existing capacity and processes, and that are covered by the 
existing applicable control document, are not subject to an 
antidegradation review. These changes include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Normal operational variability;
    (2) Changes in intake water pollutants;
    (3) Increasing the production hours of the facility, (e.g., adding a 
second shift); or
    (4) Increasing the rate of production.
    C. Also, excluded from an antidegradation review are new effluent 
limits based on improved monitoring data or new water quality criteria 
or values that are not a result of changes in pollutant loading.
    B. For all waters, the Director shall ensure that the level of water 
quality necessary to protect existing uses is maintained. In order to 
achieve this requirement, and consistent with 40 CFR 131.10, water 
quality standards use designations must include all existing uses. 
Controls shall be established as necessary on point and nonpoint sources 
of pollutants to ensure that the criteria applicable to the designated 
use are achieved in the water and that any designated use of a 
downstream water is protected. Where water quality does not support the 
designated uses of a waterbody or ambient pollutant concentrations 
exceed water quality criteria applicable to that waterbody, the Director 
shall not allow a lowering of water quality for the pollutant or 
pollutants preventing the attainment of such uses or exceeding such 
criteria.
    C. For Outstanding National Resource Waters:
    1. The Director shall ensure, through the application of appropriate 
controls on pollutant sources, that water quality is maintained and 
protected.
    2. Exception. A short-term, temporary (i.e., weeks or months) 
lowering of water quality may be permitted by the Director.
    D. For high quality waters, the Director shall ensure that no action 
resulting in a lowering of water quality occurs unless an 
antidegradation demonstration has been completed pursuant to section III 
of this appendix and the information thus provided is determined by the 
Director pursuant to section IV of this appendix to adequately support 
the lowering of water quality.
    1. The Director shall establish conditions in the control document 
applicable to the regulated facility that prohibit the regulated 
facility from undertaking any deliberate action, such that there would 
be an increase in the rate of mass loading of any BCC, unless an 
antidegradation demonstration is provided to the Director and approved 
pursuant to section IV of this appendix prior to commencement of the 
action. Imposition of limits due to improved monitoring data or new 
water quality criteria or values, or changes in loadings of any BCC 
within the existing capacity and processes, and that are covered by the 
existing applicable control document, are not subject to an 
antidegradation review.
    2. For BCCs known or believed to be present in a discharge, from a 
point or nonpoint source, a monitoring requirement shall be included in 
the control document. The control document shall also include a 
provision requiring the source to notify the Director or any increased 
loadings. Upon notification, the Director shall require actions as 
necessary to reduce or eliminate the increased loading.
    3. Fact Sheets prepared pursuant to 40 CFR 124.8 and 124.56 shall 
reflect any conditions developed under sections II.D.1 or II.D.2 of this 
appendix and included in a permit.
    E. Special Provisions for Lake Superior.The following conditions 
apply in addition to those specified in section II.B through II.C of 
this appendix for waters of Lake Superior so designated.
    1. A State or Tribe may designate certain specified areas of the 
Lake Superior Basin as Lake Superior Basin--Outstanding National 
Resource Waters for the purpose of prohibiting the new or increased 
discharge of Lake Superior bioaccumulative substances of immediate 
concern from point sources in these areas.
    2. States and Tribes may designate all waters of the Lake Superior 
Basin as Outstanding International Resource Waters for the purpose of 
restricting the increased discharge of Lake Superior bioaccumulative 
substances of immediate concern from point sources consistent with the 
requirements of sections III.C and IV.B of this appendix.
    F. Exemptions. Except as the Director may determine on a case-by-
case basis that the application of these procedures is required to 
adequately protect water quality, or as the affected waterbody is an 
Outstanding National Resource Water as defined in section II.A of this 
appendix, the procedures in this part do not apply to:
    1. Short-term, temporary (i.e., weeks or months) lowering of water 
quality;
    2. Bypasses that are not prohibited at 40 CFR 122.41(m); and
    3. Response actions pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental 
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended, or 
similar Federal, State or Tribal authorities, undertaken to alleviate a 
release into the environment of hazardous substances, pollutants or 
contaminants which may pose an imminent and substantial danger to public 
health or welfare.

[[Page 684]]

                   III. Antidegradation Demonstration

    Any entity seeking to lower water quality in a high quality water or 
create a new or increased discharge of Lake Superior bioaccumulative 
substances of immediate concern in a Lake Superior Outstanding 
International Resource Water must first, as required by sections II.D or 
II.E.2 of this appendix, submit an antidegradation demonstration for 
consideration by the Director. States and Tribes should tailor the level 
of detail and documentation in antidegradation reviews, to the specific 
circumstances encountered. The antidegradation demonstration shall 
include the following:
    A. Pollution Prevention Alternatives Analysis. Identify any cost-
effective pollution prevention alternatives and techniques that are 
available to the entity, that would eliminate or significantly reduce 
the extent to which the increased loading results in a lowering of water 
quality.
    B. Alternative or Enhanced Treatment Analysis. Identify alternative 
or enhanced treatment techniques that are available to the entity that 
would eliminate the lowering of water quality and their costs relative 
to the cost of treatment necessary to achieve applicable effluent 
limitations.
    C. Lake Superior. If the States or Tribes designate the waters of 
Lake Superior as Outstanding International Resource Waters pursuant to 
section II.E.2 of this appendix, then any entity proposing a new or 
increased discharge of any Lake Superior bioaccumulative substance of 
immediate concern to the Lake Superior Basin shall identify the best 
technology in process and treatment to eliminate or reduce the extent of 
the lowering of water quality. In this case, the requirements in section 
III.B of this appendix do not apply.
    D. Important Social or Economic Development Analysis. Identify the 
social or economic development and the benefits to the area in which the 
waters are located that will be foregone if the lowering of water 
quality is not allowed.
    E. Special Provision for Remedial Actions. Entities proposing 
remedial actions pursuant to the CERCLA, as amended, corrective actions 
pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or 
similar actions pursuant to other Federal or State environmental 
statutes may submit information to the Director that demonstrates that 
the action utilizes the most cost effective pollution prevention and 
treatment techniques available, and minimizes the necessary lowering of 
water quality, in lieu of the information required by sections III.B 
through III.D of this appendix.

                      IV. Antidegradation Decision

    A. Once the Director determines that the information provided by the 
entity proposing to increase loadings is administratively complete, the 
Director shall use that information to determine whether or not the 
lowering of water quality is necessary, and, if it is necessary, whether 
or not the lowering of water quality will support important social and 
economic development in the area. If the proposed lowering of water 
quality is either not necessary, or will not support important social 
and economic development, the Director shall deny the request to lower 
water quality. If the lowering of water quality is necessary, and will 
support important social and economic development, the Director may 
allow all or part of the proposed lowering to occur as necessary to 
accommodate the important social and economic development. In no event 
may the decision reached under this section allow water quality to be 
lowered below the minimum level required to fully support existing and 
designated uses. The decision of the Director shall be subject to the 
public participation requirements of 40 CFR 25.
    B. If States designate the waters of Lake Superior as Outstanding 
International Resource Waters pursuant to section II.E.2 of this 
appendix, any entity requesting to lower water quality in the Lake 
Superior Basin as a result of the new or increased discharge of any Lake 
Superior bioaccumulative substance of immediate concern shall be 
required to install and utilize the best technology in process and 
treatment as identified by the Director.

      Appendix F to Part 132--Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative 
                        Implementation Procedures

     Procedure 1: Site-specific Modifications to Criteria and Values

    Great Lakes States and Tribes shall adopt provisions consistent with 
(as protective as) this procedure.
    A. Requirements for Site-specific Modifications to Criteria and 
Values. Criteria and values may be modified on a site-specific basis to 
reflect local environmental conditions as restricted by the following 
provisions. Any such modifications must be protective of designated uses 
and aquatic life, wildlife or human health and be submitted to EPA for 
approval. In addition, any site-specific modifications that result in 
less stringent criteria must be based on a sound scientific rationale 
and shall not be likely to jeopardize the continued existence of 
endangered or threatened species listed or proposed under section 4 of 
the Endangered Species Act (ESA) or result in the destruction or adverse 
modification of such species' critical habitat. More stringent 
modifications shall be developed to protect endangered or threatened 
species listed or proposed under section 4 of the ESA, where such 
modifications are necessary to ensure

[[Page 685]]

that water quality is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence 
of such species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of 
such species' critical habitat. More stringent modifications may also be 
developed to protect candidate (C1) species being considered by the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for listing under section 4 of the ESA, 
where such modifications are necessary to protect such species.
    1. Aquatic Life.
    a. Aquatic life criteria or values may be modified on a site-
specific basis to provide an additional level of protection, pursuant to 
authority reserved to the States and Tribes under Clean Water Act (CWA) 
section 510.
    Guidance on developing site-specific criteria in these instances is 
provided in Chapter 3 of the U.S. EPA Water Quality Standards Handbook, 
Second Edition--Revised (1994).
    b. Less stringent site-specific modifications to chronic or acute 
aquatic life criteria or values may be developed when:
    i. The local water quality characteristics such as Ph, hardness, 
temperature, color, etc., alter the biological availability or toxicity 
of a pollutant; or
    ii. The sensitivity of the aquatic organisms species that ``occur at 
the site'' differs from the species actually tested in developing the 
criteria. The phrase ``occur at the site'' includes the species, genera, 
families, orders, classes, and phyla that: are usually present at the 
site; are present at the site only seasonally due to migration; are 
present intermittently because they periodically return to or extend 
their ranges into the site; were present at the site in the past, are 
not currently present at the site due to degraded conditions, and are 
expected to return to the site when conditions improve; are present in 
nearby bodies of water, are not currently present at the site due to 
degraded conditions, and are expected to be present at the site when 
conditions improve. The taxa that ``occur at the site'' cannot be 
determined merely by sampling downstream and/or upstream of the site at 
one point in time. ``Occur at the site'' does not include taxa that were 
once present at the site but cannot exist at the site now due to 
permanent physical alteration of the habitat at the site resulting, for 
example, from dams, etc.
    c. Less stringent modifications also may be developed to acute and 
chronic aquatic life criteria or values to reflect local physical and 
hydrological conditions.
    Guidance on developing site-specific criteria is provided in Chapter 
3 of the U.S. EPA Water Quality Standards Handbook, Second Edition--
Revised (1994).
    d. Any modifications to protect threatened or endangered aquatic 
species required by procedure 1.A of this appendix may be accomplished 
using either of the two following procedures:
    i. If the Species Mean Acute Value (SMAV) for a listed or proposed 
species, or for a surrogate of such species, is lower than the 
calculated Final Acute Value (FAV), such lower SMAV may be used instead 
of the calculated FAV in developing site-specific modified criteria; or,
    ii. The site-specific criteria may be calculated using the 
recalculation procedure for site-specific modifications described in 
Chapter 3 of the U.S. EPA Water Quality Standards Handbook, Second 
Edition--Revised (1994).
    2. Wildlife.
    a. Wildlife water quality criteria may be modified on a site-
specific basis to provide an additional level of protection, pursuant to 
authority reserved to the States and Tribes under CWA section 510.
    b. Less stringent site-specific modifications to wildlife water 
quality criteria may be developed when a site-specific bioaccumulation 
factor (BAF) is derived which is lower than the system-wide BAF derived 
under appendix B of this part. The modification must consider both the 
mobility of prey organisms and wildlife populations in defining the site 
for which criteria are developed. In addition, there must be a showing 
that:
    i. Any increased uptake of the toxicant by prey species utilizing 
the site will not cause adverse effects in wildlife populations; and
    ii. Wildlife populations utilizing the site or downstream waters 
will continue to be fully protected.
    c. Any modification to protect endangered or threatened wildlife 
species required by procedure 1.A of this appendix must consider both 
the mobility of prey organisms and wildlife populations in defining the 
site for which criteria are developed, and may be accomplished by using 
the following recommended method.
    i. The methodology presented in appendix D to part 132 is used, 
substituting appropriate species-specific toxicological, 
epidemiological, or exposure information, including changes to the BAF;
    ii. An interspecies uncertainty factor of 1 should be used where 
epidemiological data are available for the species in question. If 
necessary, species-specific exposure parameters can be derived as 
presented in Appendix D of this part;
    iii. An intraspecies uncertainty factor (to account for protection 
of individuals within a wildlife population) should be applied in the 
denominator of the effect part of the wildlife equation in appendix D of 
this part in a manner consistent with the other uncertainty factors 
described in appendix D of this part; and
    iv. The resulting wildlife value for the species in question should 
be compared to the two class-specific wildlife values which were 
previously calculated, and the lowest of the

[[Page 686]]

three shall be selected as the site-specific modification.

    Note: Further discussion on the use of this methodology may be found 
in the Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative Technical Support Document 
for Wildlife Criteria.

    3. BAFs.
    a. BAFs may be modified on a site-specific basis to larger values, 
pursuant to the authority reserved to the States and Tribes under CWA 
section 510, where reliable data show that local bioaccumulation is 
greater than the system-wide value.
    b. BAFs may be modified on a site-specific basis to lower values, 
where scientifically defensible, if:
    i. The fraction of the total chemical that is freely dissolved in 
the ambient water is different than that used to derive the system-wide 
BAFs (i.e., the concentrations of particulate organic carbon and the 
dissolved organic carbon are different than those used to derive the 
system-wide BAFs);
    ii. Input parameters of the Gobas model, such as the structure of 
the aquatic food web and the disequilibrium constant, are different at 
the site than those used to derive the system-wide BAFs;
    iii. The percent lipid of aquatic organisms that are consumed and 
occur at the site is different than that used to derive the system-wide 
BAFs; or
    iv. Site-specific field-measured BAFs or biota-sediment accumulation 
factor (BSAFs) are determined.
    If site-specific BAFs are derived, they shall be derived using the 
methodology in appendix B of this part.
    c. Any more stringent modifications to protect threatened or 
endangered species required by procedure 1.A of this appendix shall be 
derived using procedures set forth in the methodology in appendix B of 
this part.
    4. Human Health.
    a. Human health criteria or values may be modified on a site-
specific basis to provide an additional level of protection, pursuant to 
authority reserved to the States and Tribes under CWA section 510. Human 
health criteria or values shall be modified on a site-specific basis to 
provide additional protection appropriate for highly exposed 
subpopulations.
    b. Less stringent site-specific modifications to human health 
criteria or values may be developed when:
    i. local fish consumption rates are lower than the rate used in 
deriving human health criteria or values under appendix C of this part; 
and/or
    ii. a site-specific BAF is derived which is lower than that used in 
deriving human health criteria or values under appendix C of this part.
    B. Notification Requirements. When a State proposes a site-specific 
modification to a criterion or value as allowed in section 4.A above, 
the State should notify the other Great Lakes States of such a proposal 
and, for less stringent criteria, supply appropriate justification.

  Procedure 2: Variances from Water Quality Standards for Point Sources

    The Great Lakes States or Tribes may adopt water quality standards 
(WQS) variance procedures and may grant WQS variances for point sources 
pursuant to such procedures. Variance procedures shall be consistent 
with (as protective as) the provisions in this procedure.
    A. Applicability. A State or Tribe may grant a variance to a WQS 
which is the basis of a water quality-based effluent limitation included 
in a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. A 
WQS variance applies only to the permittee requesting the variance and 
only to the pollutant or pollutants specified in the variance. A 
variance does not affect, or require the State or Tribe to modify, the 
corresponding water quality standard for the waterbody as a whole.
    1. This provision shall not apply to new Great Lakes dischargers or 
recommencing dischargers.
    2. A variance to a water quality standard shall not be granted that 
would likely jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or 
threatened species listed under Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act 
(ESA) or result in the destruction or adverse modification of such 
species' critical habitat.
    3. A WQS variance shall not be granted if standards will be attained 
by implementing effluent limits required under sections 301(b) and 306 
of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and by the permittee implementing cost-
effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source 
control.
    B. Maximum Timeframe for Variances. A WQS variance shall not exceed 
five years or the term of the NPDES permit, whichever is less. A State 
or Tribe shall review, and modify as necessary, WQS variances as part of 
each water quality standards review pursuant to section 303(c) of the 
CWA.
    C. Conditions to Grant a Variance. A variance may be granted if:
    1. The permittee demonstrates to the State or Tribe that attaining 
the WQS is not feasible because:
    a. Naturally occurring pollutant concentrations prevent the 
attainment of the WQS;

[[Page 687]]

    b. Natural, ephemeral, intermittent or low flow conditions or water 
levels prevent the attainment of the WQS, unless these conditions may be 
compensated for by the discharge of sufficient volume of effluent to 
enable WQS to be met without violating State or Tribal water 
conservation requirements;
    c. Human-caused conditions or sources of pollution prevent the 
attainment of the WQS and cannot be remedied, or would cause more 
environmental damage to correct than to leave in place;
    d. Dams, diversions or other types of hydrologic modifications 
preclude the attainment of the WQS, and it is not feasible to restore 
the waterbody to its original condition or to operate such modification 
in a way that would result in the attainment of the WQS;
    e. Physical conditions related to the natural features of the 
waterbody, such as the lack of a proper substrate cover, flow, depth, 
pools, riffles, and the like, unrelated to chemical water quality, 
preclude attainment of WQS; or
    f. Controls more stringent than those required by sections 301(b) 
and 306 of the CWA would result in substantial and widespread economic 
and social impact.
    2. In addition to the requirements of C.1, above, the permittee 
shall also:
    a. Show that the variance requested conforms to the requirements of 
the State's or Tribe's antidegradation procedures; and
    b. Characterize the extent of any increased risk to human health and 
the environment associated with granting the variance compared with 
compliance with WQS absent the variance, such that the State or Tribe is 
able to conclude that any such increased risk is consistent with the 
protection of the public health, safety and welfare.
    D. Submittal of Variance Application. The permittee shall submit an 
application for a variance to the regulatory authority issuing the 
permit. The application shall include:
    1. All relevant information demonstrating that attaining the WQS is 
not feasible based on one or more of the conditions in section C.1 of 
this procedure; and,
    2. All relevant information demonstrating compliance with the 
conditions in section C.2 of this procedure.
    E. Public Notice of Preliminary Decision. Upon receipt of a complete 
application for a variance, and upon making a preliminary decision 
regarding the variance, the State or Tribe shall public notice the 
request and preliminary decision for public comment pursuant to the 
regulatory authority's Administrative Procedures Act and shall notify 
the other Great Lakes States and Tribes of the preliminary decision. 
This public notice requirement may be satisfied by including the 
supporting information for the variance and the preliminary decision in 
the public notice of a draft NPDES permit.
    F. Final Decision on Variance Request. The State or Tribe shall 
issue a final decision on the variance request within 90 days of the 
expiration of the public comment period required in section E of this 
procedure. If all or part of the variance is approved by the State or 
Tribe, the decision shall include all permit conditions needed to 
implement those parts of the variance so approved. Such permit 
conditions shall, at a minimum, require:
    1. Compliance with an initial effluent limitation which, at the time 
the variance is granted, represents the level currently achievable by 
the permittee, and which is no less stringent than that achieved under 
the previous permit;
    2. That reasonable progress be made toward attaining the water 
quality standards for the waterbody as a whole through appropriate 
conditions;
    3. When the duration of a variance is shorter than the duration of a 
permit, compliance with an effluent limitation sufficient to meet the 
underlying water quality standard, upon the expiration of said variance; 
and
    4. A provision that allows the permitting authority to reopen and 
modify the permit based on any State or Tribal triennial water quality 
standards revisions to the variance.
    The State shall deny a variance request if the permittee fails to 
make the demonstrations required under section C of this procedure.
    G. Incorporating Variance into Permit. The State or Tribe shall 
establish and incorporate into the permittee's NPDES permit all 
conditions needed to implement the variance as determined in section F 
of this procedure.
    H. Renewal of Variance. A variance may be renewed, subject to the 
requirements of sections A through G of this procedure. As part of any 
renewal application, the permittee shall again demonstrate that 
attaining WQS is not feasible based on the requirements of section C of 
this procedure. The permittee's application shall also contain 
information concerning its compliance with the conditions incorporated 
into its permit as part of the original variance pursuant to sections F 
and G of this procedure. Renewal of a variance may be denied if the 
permittee did not comply with the conditions of the original variance.
    I. EPA Approval. All variances and supporting information shall be 
submitted by the State or Tribe to the appropriate EPA regional office 
and shall include:
    1. Relevant permittee applications pursuant to section D of this 
procedure;
    2. Public comments and records of any public hearings pursuant to 
section E of this procedure;
    3. The final decision pursuant to section F of this procedure; and,
    4. NPDES permits issued pursuant to section G of this procedure.

[[Page 688]]

    5. Items required by sections I.1 through I.3. of this procedure 
shall be submitted by the State within 30 days of the date of the final 
variance decision. The item required by section I.4 of this procedure 
shall be submitted in accordance with the State or Tribe Memorandum of 
Agreement with the Regional Administrator pursuant to 40 CFR 123.24.
    6. EPA shall review the State or Tribe submittal for compliance with 
the CWA pursuant to 40 CFR 123.44, and 40 CFR 131.21.
    J. State WQS Revisions. All variances shall be appended to the State 
or Tribe WQS rules.

Procedure 3: Total Maximum Daily Loads, Wasteload Allocations for Point 
Sources, Load Allocations for Nonpoint Sources, Wasteload Allocations in 
    the Absence of a TMDL, and Preliminary Wasteload Allocations for 
Purposes of Determining the Need for Water Quality Based Effluent Limits

    The Great Lakes States and Tribes shall adopt provisions consistent 
with (as protective as) this procedure 3 for the purpose of developing 
Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs), Wasteload Allocations (WLAs) in the 
Absence of TMDLs, and Preliminary Wasteload Allocations for Purposes of 
Determining the Need for Water Quality Based Effluent Limits (WQBELs), 
except as specifically provided.
    A. Where a State or Tribe develops an assessment and remediation 
plan that the State or Tribe certifies meets the requirements of 
sections B through F of this procedure and public participation 
requirements applicable to TMDLs, and that has been approved by EPA as 
meeting those requirements under 40 CFR 130.6, the assessment and 
remediation plan may be used in lieu of a TMDL for purposes of appendix 
F to part 132. Assessment and remediation plans under this procedure may 
include, but are not limited to, Lakewide Management Plans, Remedial 
Action Plans, and State Water Quality Management Plans. Also, any part 
of an assessment and remediation plan that also satisfies one or more 
requirements under Clean Water Act (CWA) section 303(d) or implementing 
regulations may be incorporated by reference into a TMDL as appropriate. 
Assessment and remediation plans under this section should be tailored 
to the level of detail and magnitude for the watershed and pollutant 
being assessed.
    B. General Conditions of Application. Except as provided in 
Sec. 132.4, the following are conditions applicable to establishing 
TMDLs for all pollutants and pollutant parameters in the Great Lakes 
System, with the exception of whole effluent toxicity, unless otherwise 
provided in procedure 6 of appendix F. Where specified, these conditions 
also apply to wasteload allocations (WLAs) calculated in the absence of 
TMDLs and to preliminary WLAs for purposes of determining the needs for 
WQBELs under procedure 5 of appendix F.
    1. TMDLs Required. TMDLs shall, at a minimum, be established in 
accordance with the listing and priority setting process established in 
section 303(d) of the CWA and at 40 CFR 130.7. Where water quality 
standards cannot be attained immediately, TMDLs must reflect reasonable 
assurances that water quality standards will be attained in a reasonable 
period of time. Some TMDLs may be based on attaining water quality 
standards over a period of time, with specific controls on individual 
sources being implemented in stages. Determining the reasonable period 
of time in which water quality standards will be met is a case-specific 
determination considering a number of factors including, but not limited 
to: receiving water characteristics; persistence, behavior and ubiquity 
of pollutants of concern; type of remediation activities necessary; 
available regulatory and non-regulatory controls; and individual State 
or Tribal requirements for attainment of water quality standards.
    2. Attainment of Water Quality Standards. A TMDL must ensure 
attainment of applicable water quality standards, including all numeric 
and narrative criteria, Tier I criteria, and Tier II values for each 
pollutant or pollutants for which a TMDL is established.
    3. TMDL Allocations.
    a. TMDLs shall include WLAs for point sources and load allocations 
(LAs) for nonpoint sources, including natural background, such that the 
sum of these allocations is not greater than the loading capacity of the 
water for the pollutant(s) addressed by the TMDL, minus the sum of a 
specified margin of safety (MOS) and any capacity reserved for future 
growth.
    b. Nonpoint source LAs shall be based on:
    i. Existing pollutant loadings if changes in loadings are not 
reasonably anticipated to occur;
    ii. Increases in pollutant loadings that are reasonably anticipated 
to occur;
    iii. Anticipated decreases in pollutant loadings if such decreased 
loadings are technically feasible and are reasonably anticipated to 
occur within a reasonable time period as a result of implementation of 
best management practices or other load reduction measures. In 
determining whether anticipated decreases in pollutant loadings are 
technically feasible and can reasonably be expected to occur within a 
reasonable period of time, technical and institutional factors shall be 
considered. These decisions are case-specific and should reflect the 
particular TMDL under consideration.
    c. WLAs. The portion of the loading capacity not assigned to 
nonpoint sources including background, or to an MOS, or reserved for 
future growth is allocated to point sources. Upon reissuance, NPDES 
permits for these point sources must include effluent

[[Page 689]]

limitations consistent with WLAs in EPA-approved or EPA-established 
TMDLs.
    d. Monitoring. For LAs established on the basis of subsection b.iii 
above, monitoring data shall be collected and analyzed in order to 
validate the TMDL's assumptions, to varify anticipated load reductions, 
to evaluate the effectiveness of controls being used to implement the 
TMDL, and to revise the WLAs and LAs as necessary to ensure that water 
quality standards will be achieved within the time-period established in 
the TMDL.
    4. WLA Values. If separate EPA-approved or EPA-established TMDLs are 
prepared for different segments of the same watershed, and the separate 
TMDLs each include WLAs for the same pollutant for one or more of the 
same point sources, then WQBELs for that pollutant for the point 
source(s) shall be consistent with the most stringent of those WLAs in 
order to ensure attainment of all applicable water quality standards.
    5. Margin of Safety (MOS). Each TMDL shall include a MOS sufficient 
to account for technical uncertainties in establishing the TMDL and 
shall describe the manner in which the MOS is determined and 
incorporated into the TMDL. The MOS may be provided by leaving a portion 
of the loading capacity unallocated or by using conservative modeling 
assumptions to establish WLAs and LAs. If a portion of the loading 
capacity is left unallocated to provide a MOS, the amount left 
unallocated shall be described. If conservative modeling assumptions are 
relied on to provide a MOS, the specific assumptions providing the MOS 
shall be identified.
    6. More Stringent Requirements. States and Tribes may exercise 
authority reserved to them under section 510 of the CWA to develop more 
stringent TMDLs (including WLAs and LAs) than are required herein, 
provided that all LAs in such TMDLs reflect actual nonpoint source loads 
or those loads that can reasonably be expected to occur within a 
reasonable time-period as a result of implementing nonpoint source 
controls.
    7. Accumulation in Sediments. TMDLs shall reflect, where appropriate 
and where sufficient data are available, contributions to the water 
column from sediments inside and outside of any applicable mixing zones. 
TMDLs shall be sufficiently stringent so as to prevent accumulation of 
the pollutant of concern in sediments to levels injurious to designated 
or existing uses, human health, wildlife and aquatic life.
    8. Wet Weather Events. Notwithstanding the exception provided for 
the establishment of controls on wet weather point sources in 
Sec. 132.4(e)(1), TMDLs shall reflect, where appropriate and where 
sufficient data are available, discharges resulting from wet weather 
events. This procedure does not provide specific procedures for 
considering discharges resulting from wet weather events. However, some 
of the provisions of procedure 3 may be deemed appropriate for 
considering wet weather events on a case-by-case basis.
    9. Background Concentration of Pollutants. The representative 
background concentration of pollutants shall be established in 
accordance with this subsection to develop TMDLs, WLAs calculated in the 
absence of a TMDL, or preliminary WLAs for purposes of determining the 
need for WQBELs under procedure 5 of appendix F. Background loadings may 
be accounted for in a TMDL through an allocation to a single 
``background'' category or through individual allocations to the various 
background sources.
    a. Definition of Background. ``Background'' represents all loadings 
that: (1) flow from upstream waters into the specified watershed, 
waterbody or waterbody segment for which a TMDL, WLA in the absence of a 
TMDL or preliminary WLA for the purpose of determining the need for a 
WQBEL is being developed; (2) enter the specified watershed, waterbody 
or waterbody segment through atmospheric deposition or sediment release 
or resuspension; or (3) occur within the watershed, waterbody or 
waterbody segment as a result of chemical reactions.
    b. Data considerations. When determining what available data are 
acceptable for use in calculating background, the State or Tribe should 
use best professional judgment, including consideration of the sampling 
location and the reliability of the data through comparison to reported 
analytical detection levels and quantification levels. When data in more 
than one of the data sets or categories described in section B.9.c.i 
through B.9.c.iii below exist, best professional judgment should be used 
to select the one data set that most accurately reflects or estimates 
background concentrations. Pollutant degradation and transport 
information may be considered when utilizing pollutant loading data.
    c. Calculation requirements. Except as provided below, the 
representative background concentration for a pollutant in the specified 
watershed, waterbody or waterbody segment shall be established on a 
case-by-case basis as the geometric mean of:
    i. Acceptable available water column data; or
    ii. Water column concentrations estimated through use of acceptable 
available caged or resident fish tissue data; or
    iii. Water column concentrations estimated through use of acceptable 
available or projected pollutant loading data.
    d. Detection considerations.
    i. Commonly accepted statistical techniques shall be used to 
evaluate data sets consisting of values both above and below the 
detection level.
    ii. When all of the acceptable available data in a data set or 
category, such as water

[[Page 690]]

column, caged or resident fish tissue or pollutant loading data, are 
below the level of detection for a pollutant, then all the data for that 
pollutant in that data set shall be assumed to be zero.
    10. Effluent Flow. If WLAs are expressed as concentrations of 
pollutants, the TMDL shall also indicate the point source effluent flows 
assumed in the analyses. Mass loading limitations established in NPDES 
permits must be consistent with both the WLA and assumed effluent flows 
used in establishing the TMDL.
    11. Reserved Allocations. TMDLs may include reserved allocations of 
loading capacity to accommodate future growth and additional sources. 
Where such reserved allocations are not included in a TMDL, any 
increased loadings of the pollutant for which the TMDL was developed 
that are due to a new or expanded discharge shall not be allowed unless 
the TMDL is revised in accordance with these proceudres to include an 
allocation for the new or expanded discharge.
    C. Mixing Zones for Bioaccumulative Chemicals of Concern (BCCs). The 
following requirements shall be applied in establishing TMDLs, WLAs in 
the absence of TMDLs, and preliminary WLAs for purposes of determining 
the need for WQBELs under procedure 5 of appendix F, for BCCs:
    1. Beginning on March 23, 1997, there shall be no mixing available 
for new discharges of BCCs to the Great Lakes System. WLAs established 
through TMDLs, WLAs in the absence of TMDLs, and preliminary WLAs for 
purposes of determining the need for WQBELs for new discharges of BCCs 
shall be set equal to the most stringent applicable water quality 
criteria or values for the BCCs in question.
    2. For purposes of section C of procedure 3 of appendix F, new 
discharges are defined as: (1) discharges from new Great Lakes 
dischargers; or (2) new or expanded discharges from an existing Great 
Lakes discharger. All other discharges of BCCs are defined as existing 
discharges.
    3. Up until March 23, 2007, mixing zones for BCCs may be allowed for 
existing discharges to the Great Lakes System pursuant to the procedures 
specified in sections D and E of this procedure.
    4. Except as provided in sections C.5 and C.6 of this procedure, 
permits issued on or after March 23, 1997 shall not authorize mixing 
zones for existing discharges of BCCs to the Great Lakes System after 
March 23, 2007. After March 23, 2007, WLAs established through TMDLs, 
WLAs established in the absence of TMDLs and preliminary WLAs for 
purposes of determining the need for WQBELs under procedure 5 of 
appendix F for existing dischrges of BCCs to the Great Lakes System 
shall be set equal to the most stringent applicable water quality 
criteria or values for the BCCs in question.
    5. Exception for Water Conservation. States and Tribes may grant 
mixing zones for any existing discharge of BCCs to the Great Lakes 
System beyond the dates specified in sections C.3 and C.4 of this 
procedure, where it can be demonstrated, on a case-by-case basis, that 
failure to grant a mixing zone would preclude water conservation 
measures that would lead to overall load reductions in BCCs, even though 
higher concentrations of BCCs occur in the effluent. Such mixing zones 
must also be consistent with sections D and E of this procedure.
    6. Exception for Technical and Economic Considerations. States and 
Tribes may grant mixing zones beyond the dates specified in sections C.3 
and C.4 of this procedure for any existing discharges of a BCC to the 
Great Lakes System upon the request of a discharger subject to the 
limited circumstances specified in sections C.6.a through C.6.d below. 
Such mixing zones shall also be consistent with sections D and E of this 
procedure.
    a. The permitting authority must determine that:
    i. The discharger is in compliance with and will continue to 
implement all applicable technology-based treatment and pretreatment 
requirements of CWA sections 301, 302, 304, 306, 307, 401, and 402, and 
is in compliance with its existing NPDES water quality-based effluent 
limitations, including those based on a mixing zone; and
    ii. The discharger has reduced and will continue to reduce the 
loading of the BCC for which a mixing zone is requested to the maximum 
extent possible.
    b. In making the determination in section C.6.a above, the State or 
Tribal authority should consider:
    i. The availability and feasibility, including cost effectiveness, 
of additional controls or pollution prevention measures for reducing and 
ultimately eliminating BCCs for that discharger, including those used by 
similar dischargers;
    ii. Whether the discharger or affected communities will suffer 
unreasonable economic effects if the mixing zone is eliminated;
    iii. The extent to which the discharger will implement an ambient 
monitoring plan to ensure compliance with water quality criteria at the 
edge of any authorized mixing zone or to ensure consistency with any 
applicable TMDL or such other strategy consistent with section A of this 
procedure; and,
    iv. Other information the State or Tribe deems appropriate.
    c. Any exceptions to the mixing zone elimination provision for 
existing discharges of BCCs granted pursuant to this section shall:
    i. Not result in any less stringent limitations than those existing 
March 23, 1997;

[[Page 691]]

    ii. Not likely jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered 
or threatened species listed under section 4 of the ESA or result in the 
destruction or adverse modification of such species' critical habitat;
    iii. Be limited to one permit term unless the permitting authority 
makes a new determination in accordance with this section for each 
successive permit application in which a mixing zone for the BCC(s) is 
sought;
    iv. Reflect all information relevant to the size of the mixing zone 
considered by the State or Tribe under subsection b above;
    v. Protect all designated and existing uses of the receiving water;
    vi. Meet all applicable aquatic life, wildlife and human health 
criteria and values at the edge of the mixing zone and, as appropriate, 
within the mixing zone or be consistent with any appropriate TMDL or 
such other strategy consistent with section A of this procedure;
    vii. Ensure the discharger has developed and conducted a pollutant 
minimization program for the BCC(s) if required to do so under 
regulations adopted consistent with procedure 8 of appendix F; and
    viii. Ensure that alternative means for reducing BCCs elsewhere in 
the watershed are evaluated.
    d. For each draft NPDES permit that would allow a mixing zone for 
one or more BCCs after March 23, 2007, the fact sheet or statement of 
basis for the draft permit, required to be made available through public 
notice under 40 CFR 124.6(e), shall:
    i. Specify the mixing provisions used in calculating the permit 
limits; and
    ii. Identify each BCC for which a mixing zone is proposed.
    D. Deriving TMDLs, WLAs, and LAs for Point and Nonpoint Sources: 
WLAs in the Absence of a TMDL; and Preliminary WLAs for Purposes of 
Determining the Need for WQBELs for OWGL. This section addresses 
conditions for deriving TMDLs for Open Waters of the Great Lakes (OWGL), 
inland lakes and other waters of the Great Lakes System with no 
appreciable flow relative to their volumes. State and Tribal procedures 
to derive TMDLs under this section must be consistent with (as 
protective as) the general conditions in section B of this procedure, 
CWA section 303(d), existing regulations (40 CFR 130.7), section C of 
this procedure, and sections D.1. through D.4 below. State and Tribal 
procedures to derive WLAs calculated in the absence of a TMDL and 
preliminary WLAs for purposes of determining the need for WQBELs under 
procedure 5 of appendix F must be consistent with sections B.9, C.1, C3 
through C.6, and D. 1 through D.4 of this procedure.
    1. Individual point source WLAs and preliminary WLAs for purposes of 
determining the need for WQBELs under procedure 5 of appendix F shall 
assume no greater dilution than one part effluent to 10 parts receiving 
water for implementation of numeric and narrative chronic criteria and 
values (including, but not limited to human cancer criteria, human 
cancer values, human noncancer values, human noncancer criteria, 
wildlife criteria, and chronic aquatic life criteria and values) unless 
an alternative mixing zone is demonstrated as appropriate in a mixing 
zone demonstration conducted pursuant to section F of this procedure. In 
no case shall a mixing zone be granted that exceeds the area where 
discharge-induced mixing occurs.
    2. Appropriate mixing zone assumptions to be used in calculating 
load allocations for nonpoint sources shall be determined, consistent 
with applicable State or Tribal requirements, on a case-by-case basis.
    3. WLAs and preliminary WLAs based on acute aquatic life criteria or 
values shall not exceed the Final Acute Value (FAV), unless a mixing 
zone demonstration is conducted and approved pursuant to section F of 
this procedure. If mixing zones from two or more proximate sources 
interact or overlap, the combined effect must be evaluated to ensure 
that applicable criteria and values will be met in the area where acute 
mixing zones overlap.
    4. In no case shall a mixing zone be granted that would likely 
jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened 
species listed under section 4 of the ESA or result in the destruction 
or adverse modification of such species' critical habitat.
    E. Deriving TMDLs, WLAs, and LAs for Point and Nonpoint Sources; 
WLAs in the Absence of a TMDL; and Preliminary WLAs for the Purposes of 
Determining the Need for WQBELs for Great Lakes Systems Tributaries and 
Connecting Channels. This section describes conditions for deriving 
TMDLs for tributaries and connecting channels of the Great Lakes System 
that exhibit appreciable flows relative to their volumes. State and 
Tribal procedures to derive TMDLs must be consistent with the general 
conditions listed in section B of this procedure, section C of this 
procedure, existing TMDL regulations (40 CFR 130.7) and specific 
conditions E.1 through E.5. State and Tribal procedures to derive WLAs 
calculated in the absence of a TMDL, and preliminary WLAs for purposes 
of determining reasonable potential under procedure 5 of this appendix 
for discharges to tributaries and connecting channels must be consistent 
with sections B.9, C.1, C.3 through C.6, and E.1 through E.5 of this 
procedure.
    1. Stream Design. These design flows must be used unless data exist 
to demonstrate that an alternative stream design flow is appropriate for 
stream-specific and pollutant-specific conditions. For purposes of 
calculating a TMDL, WLAs in the absence of a TMDL, or preliminary WLAs 
for the purposes of determining reasonable potential

[[Page 692]]

under procedure 5 of this appendix, using a steady-state model, the 
stream design flows shall be:
    a. The 7-day, 10-year stream design flow (7Q10), or the 4-day, 3-
year biologically-based stream design flow for chronic aquatic life 
criteria or values;
    b. The 1-day, 10-year stream design flow (1Q10), for acute aquatic 
life criteria or values;
    c. The harmonic mean flow for human health criteria or values;
    d. The 90-day, 10-year flow (90Q10) for wildlife criteria.
    e. TMDLs, WLAs in the absence of TMDLs, and preliminary WLAs for the 
purpose of determining the need for WQBELs calculated using dynamic 
modelling do not need to incorporate the stream design flows specified 
in sections E.1.a through E.1.d of this procedure.
    2. Loading Capacity. The loading capacity is the greatest amount of 
loading that a water can receive without violating water quality 
standards. The loading capacity is initially calculated at the farthest 
downstream location in the watershed drainage basin. The maximum 
allowable loading consistent with the attainment of each applicable 
numeric criterion or value for a given pollutant is determined by 
multiplying the applicable criterion or value by the flow at the 
farthest downstream location in the tributary basin at the design flow 
condition described above. This loading is then compared to the loadings 
at sites within the basin to assure that applicable numeric criteria or 
values for a given pollutant are not exceeded at all applicable sites. 
The lowest load is then selected as the loading capacity.
    3. Polluant Degradation. TMDLs, WLAs in the absence of a TMDL and 
preliminary WLAs for purposes of determining the need for WQBELs under 
procedure 5 of appendix F shall be based on the assumption that a 
pollutant does not degrade. However, the regulatory authority may take 
into account degradation of the pollutant if each of the following 
conditions are met.
    a. Scientifically valid field studies or other relevant information 
demonstrate that degradation of the pollutant is expected to occur under 
the full range of environmental conditions expected to be encountered;
    b. Scientifically valid field studies or other relevant information 
address other factors that affect the level of pollutants in the water 
column including, but not limited to, resuspension of sediments, 
chemical speciation, and biological and chemical transformation.
    4. Acute Aquatic Life Criteria and Values. WLAs and LAs established 
in a TMDL, WLAs in the absence of a TMDL, and preliminary WLAs for the 
purpose of determining the need for WQBELs based on acute aquatic life 
criteria or values shall not exceed the FAV, unless a mixing zone 
demonstration is completed and approved pursuant to section F of this 
procedure. If mixing zones from two or more proximate sources interact 
or overlap, the combined effect must be evaluated to ensure that 
applicable criteria and values will be met in the area where any 
applicable acute mixing zones overlap. This acute WLA review shall 
include, but not be limited to, consideration of:
    a. The expected dilution under all effluent flow and concentration 
conditions at stream design flow;
    b. Maintenance of a zone of passage for aquatic organisms; and
    c. Protection of critical aquatic habitat.
    In no case shall a permitting authority grant a mixing zone that 
would likely jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or 
threatened species listed under section 4 of the ESA or result in the 
destruction or adverse modification of such species' critical habitat.
    5. Chronic Mixing Zones. WLAs and LAs established in a TMDL, WLAs in 
the absence of a TMDL, and preliminary WLAs for the purposes of 
determining the need for WQBELs for protection of aquatic life, wildlife 
and human health from chronic effects shall be calculated using a 
dilution fraction no greater than 25 percent of the stream design flow 
unless a mixing zone demonstration pursuant to section F of this 
procedure is conducted and approved. A demonstration for a larger mixing 
zone may be provided, if approved and implemented in accordance with 
section F of this procedure. In no case shall a permitting authority 
grant a mixing zone that would likely jeopardize the continued existence 
of any endangered or threatened species listed under section 4 of the 
ESA or result in the destruction or adverse modification of such 
species' critical habitat.
    F. Mixing Zone Demonstration Requirements.
    1. For purposes of establishing a mixing zone other than as 
specified in sections D and E above, a mixing zone demonstration must:
    a. Describe the amount of dilution occurring at the boundaries of 
the proposed mixing zone and the size, shape, and location of the area 
of mixing, including the manner in which diffusion and dispersion occur;
    b. For sources discharging to the open waters of the Great Lakes 
(OWGLs), define the location at which discharge-induced mixing ceases;
    c. Document the substrate character and geomorphology within the 
mixing zone;
    d. Show that the mixing zone does not interfere with or block 
passage of fish or aquatic life;
    e. Show that the mixing zone will be allowed only to the extent that 
the level of the pollutant permitted in the waterbody would not likely 
jeopardize the continued existence

[[Page 693]]

of any endangered or threatened species listed under section 4 of the 
ESA or result in the destruction or adverse modification of such 
species' critical habitat;
    f. Show that the mixing zone does not extend to drinking water 
intakes;
    g. Show that the mixing zone would not otherwise interfere with the 
designated or existing uses of the receiving water or downstream waters;
    h. Document background water quality concentrations;
    i. Show that the mixing zone does not promote undesirable aquatic 
life or result in a dominance of nuisance species; and
    j. Provide that by allowing additional mixing/dilution:
    i. Substances will not settle to form objectionable deposits;
    ii. Floating debris, oil, scum, and other matter in concentrations 
that form nuisances will not be produced; and
    iii. Objectionable color, odor, taste or turbidity will not be 
produced.
    2. In addition, the mixing zone demonstration shall address the 
following factors:
    a. Whether or not adjacent mixing zones overlap;
    b. Whether organisms would be attracted to the area of mixing as a 
result of the effluent character; and
    c. Whether the habitat supports endemic or naturally occurring 
species.
    3. The mixing zone demonstration must be submitted to EPA for 
approval. Following approval of a mixing zone demonstration consistent 
with sections F.1 and F.2, adjustment to the dilution ratio specified in 
section D.1 of this procedure shall be limited to the dilution available 
in the area where discharger-induced mixing occurs.
    4. The mixing zone demonstration shall be based on the assumption 
that a pollutant does not degrade within the proposed mixing zone, 
unless:
    a. Scientifically valid field studies or other relevant information 
demonstrate that degradation of the pollutant is expected to occur under 
the full range of environmental conditions expected to be encountered; 
and
    b. Scientifically valid field studies or other relevant information 
address other factors that affect the level of pollutants in the water 
column including, but not limited to, resuspension of sediments, 
chemical speciation, and biological and chemical transformation.

                         Procedure 4: Additivity

    The Great Lakes States and Tribes shall adopt additivity provisions 
consistent with (as protective as) this procedure.
    A. The Great Lakes States and Tribes shall adopt provisions to 
protect human health from the potential adverse additive effects from 
both the noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic components of chemical 
mixtures in effluents. For the chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (CDDs) and 
chlorinated dibenzofurans (CDFs) listed in Table 1, potential adverse 
additive effects in effluents shall be accounted for in accordance with 
section B of this procedure.
    B. Toxicity Equivalency Factors (TEFs)/Bioaccumulation Equivalency 
Factors (BEFs).
    1. The TEFs in Table 1 and BEFs in Table 2 shall be used when 
calculating a 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxicity equivalence concentration in 
effluent to be used when implementing both human health noncancer and 
cancer criteria. The chemical concentration of each CDDs and CDFs in 
effluent shall be converted to a 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxicity equivalence 
concentration in effluent by (a) multiplying the chemical concentration 
of each CDDs and CDFs in the effluent by the appropriate TEF in Table 1 
below, (b) multiplying each product from step (a) by the BEF for each 
CDDs and CDFs in Table 2 below, and (c) adding all final products from 
step (b). The equation for calculating the 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxicity 
equivalence concentration in effluent is:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR95.118

where:

(TEC)<INF>tcdd=2,3,7,8-TCDD toxicity equivalence concentration in 
          effluent
(C)<INF>x=concentration of total chemical x in effluent
(TEF)<INF>x=TCDD toxicity equivalency factor for x
(BEF)<INF>x=TCDD bioaccumulation equivalency factor for x

    2. The 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxicity equivalence concentration in effluent 
shall be used when developing waste load allocations under procedure 3, 
preliminary waste load allocations for purposes of determining 
reasonable potential under procedure 5, and for purposes of establishing 
effluent quality limits under procedure 5.

   Procedure 5: Reasonable Potential To Exceed Water Quality Standards

    Great Lakes States and Tribes shall adopt provisions consistent with 
(as protective as) this procedure. If a permitting authority determines 
that a pollutant is or may be discharged into the Great Lakes System at 
a level which will cause, have the reasonable potential to cause, or 
contribute to an excursion above any Tier I criterion or Tier II value, 
the permitting authority shall incorporate a water quality-based 
effluent limitation (WQBEL) in an NPDES permit for the discharge of that 
pollutant. When facility-specific effluent monitoring data are 
available, the permitting authority shall make this determination by 
developing preliminary effluent limitations (PEL) and comparing those 
effluent limitations to the projected effluent quality (PEQ) of the 
discharge in accordance with the following procedures. In all cases, the 
permitting authority shall use any valid, relevant, representative 
information that indicates a reasonable potential to exceed any Tier I 
criterion or Tier II value.
    A. Developing Preliminary Effluent Limitations on the Discharge of a 
Pollutant From a Point Source.
    1. The permitting authority shall develop preliminary wasteload 
allocations (WLAs) for the discharge of the pollutant from the point 
source to protect human health, wildlife, acute aquatic life, and 
chronic aquatic life, based upon any existing Tier I criteria. Where 
there is no Tier I criterion nor sufficient data to calculate a Tier I 
criterion, the permitting authority shall calculate a Tier II value for 
such pollutant for the protection of human health, and aquatic life and 
the preliminary WLAs shall be based upon such values. Where there is 
insufficient data to calculate a Tier II value, the permitting authority 
shall apply the procedure set forth in section C of this procedure to 
determine whether data must be generated to calculate a Tier II value.
    2. The following provisions in procedure 3 of appendix F shall be 
used as the basis for determining preliminary WLAs in accordance with 
section 1 of this procedure: procedure 3.B.9, Background Concentrations 
of Pollutants; procedure 3.C, Mixing Zones for Bioaccumulative Chemicals 
of Concern (BCCs), procedures 3.C.1, and 3.C.3 through 3.C.6; procedure 
3.D, Deriving TMDLs for Discharges to Lakes (when the receiving water is 
an open water of the Great Lakes (OWGL), an inland lake or other water 
of the Great Lakes System with no appreciable flow relative to its 
volume); procedure 3.E, Deriving TMDLs, WLAs and Preliminary WLAs, and 
load allocations (LAs) for Discharges to Great Lakes System Tributaries 
(when the receiving water is a tributary or connecting channel of the 
Great Lakes that exhibits appreciable flow relative to its volume); and 
procedure 3.F, Mixing Zone Demonstration Requirements.
    3. The permitting authority shall develop PELs consistent with the 
preliminary WLAs developed pursuant to sections A.1 and A.2 of this 
procedure, and in accordance with existing State or Tribal procedures 
for converting WLAs into WQBELs. At a minimum:
    a. The PELs based upon criteria and values for the protection of 
human health and wildlife shall be expressed as monthly limitations;
    b. The PELs based upon criteria and values for the protection of 
aquatic life from chronic effects shall be expressed as either monthly 
limitations or weekly limitations; and
    c. The PELs based upon the criteria and values for the protection of 
aquatic life from acute effects shall be expressed as daily limitations.
    B. Determining Reasonable Potential Using Effluent Pollutant 
Concentration Data.
    If representative, facility-specific effluent monitoring data 
samples are available for a pollutant discharged from a point source to 
the waters of the Great Lakes System, the permitting authority shall 
apply the following procedures:
    1. The permitting authority shall specify the PEQ as the 95 percent 
confidence level of the 95th percentile based on a log-normal 
distribution of the effluent concentration; or the maximum observed 
effluent concentration, whichever is greater. In calculating the PEQ, 
the permitting authority shall identify the number of effluent samples 
and the coefficient of variation of the effluent data, obtain the 
appropriate multiplying factor from Table 1 of procedure 6 of appendix 
F, and multiply the maximum effluent concentration by that factor. The 
coefficient of variation of the effluent data shall be calculated as the 
ratio of the standard deviation of the effluent data divided by the 
arithmetic average of the effluent data, except that where

[[Page 695]]

there are fewer than ten effluent concentration data points the 
coefficient of variation shall be specified as 0.6. If the PEQ exceeds 
any of the PELs developed in accordance with section A.3 of this 
procedure, the permitting authority shall establish a WQBEL in a NPDES 
permit for such pollutant.
    2. In lieu of following the procedures under section B.1 of this 
procedure, the permitting authority may apply procedures consistent with 
the following:
    a. The permitting authority shall specify the PEQ as the 95th 
percentile of the distribution of the projected population of daily 
values of the facility-specific effluent monitoring data projected using 
a scientifically defensible statistical method that accounts for and 
captures the long-term daily variability of the effluent quality, 
accounts for limitations associated with sparse data sets and, unless 
otherwise shown by the effluent data set, assumes a lognormal 
distribution of the facility-specific effluent data. If the PEQ exceeds 
the PEL based on the criteria and values for the protection of aquatic 
life from acute effects developed in accordance with section A.3 of this 
procedure, the permitting authority shall establish a WQBEL in an NPDES 
permit for such pollutant;
    b. The permitting authority shall calculate the PEQ as the 95th 
percentile of the distribution of the projected population of monthly 
averages of the facility-specific effluent monitoring data using a 
scientifically defensible statistical method that accounts for and 
captures the long-term variability of the monthly average effluent 
quality, accounts for limitations associated with sparse data sets and, 
unless otherwise shown by the effluent data set, assumes a lognormal 
distribution of the facility-specific effluent data. If the PEQ exceeds 
the PEL based on criteria and values for the protection of aquatic life 
from chronic effects, human health or wildlife developed in accordance 
with section A.3 of this procedure, the permitting authority shall 
establish a WQBEL in an NPDES permit for such pollutant; and
    c. The permitting authority shall calculate the PEQ as the 95th 
percentile of the distribution of the projected population of weekly 
averages of the facility-specific effluent monitoring data using a 
scientifically defensible statistical method that accounts for and 
captures the long-term variability of the weekly average effluent 
quality, accounts for limitations associated with sparse data sets and, 
unless otherwise shown by the effluent data set, assumes a lognormal 
distribution of the facility-specific effluent data. If the PEQ exceeds 
the PEL based on criteria and values to protect aquatic life from 
chronic effects developed in accordance with section A.3 of this 
procedure, the permitting authority shall establish a WQBEL in an NPDES 
permit for such pollutant.
    C. Developing Necessary Data to Calculate Tier II Values Where Such 
Data Does Not Currently Exist.
    1. Except as provided in sections C.2, C.4, or D of this procedure, 
for each pollutant listed in Table 6 of part 132 that a permittee 
reports as known or believed to be present in its effluent, and for 
which pollutant data sufficient to calculate Tier II values for non-
cancer human health, acute aquatic life and chronic aquatic life do not 
exist, the permitting authority shall take the following actions:
    a. The permitting authority shall use all available, relevant 
information, including Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship 
information and other relevant toxicity information, to estimate ambient 
screening values for such pollutant which will protect humans from 
health effects other than cancer, and aquatic life from acute and 
chronic effects.
    b. Using the procedures specified in sections A.1 and A.2 of this 
procedure, the permitting authority shall develop preliminary WLAs for 
the discharge of the pollutant from the point source to protect human 
health, acute aquatic life, and chronic aquatic life, based upon the 
estimated ambient screening values.
    c. The permitting authority shall develop PELs in accordance with 
section A.3 of this procedure, which are consistent with the preliminary 
WLAs developed in accordance with section C.1.b of this procedure.
    d. The permitting authority shall compare the PEQ developed 
according to the procedures set forth in section B of this procedure to 
the PELs developed in accordance with section C.1.c of this procedure. 
If the PEQ exceeds any of the PELs, the permitting authority shall 
generate or require the permittee to generate the data necessary to 
derive Tier II values for noncancer human health, acute aquatic life and 
chronic aquatic life.
    e. The data generated in accordance with section C.1.d of this 
procedure shall be used in calculating Tier II values as required under 
section A.1 of this procedure. The calculated Tier II value shall be 
used in calculating the preliminary WLA and PEL under section A of this 
procedure, for purposes of determining whether a WQBEL must be included 
in the permit. If the permitting authority finds that the PEQ exceeds 
the calculated PEL, a WQBEL for the pollutant or a permit limit on an 
indicator parameter consistent with 40 CFR 122.44(d)(1)(vi)(C) must be 
included in the permit.
    2. With the exception of bioaccumulative chemicals of concern 
(BCCs), a permitting authority is not required to apply the procedures 
set forth in section C.1 of this procedure or include WQBELs to protect 
aquatic life for any pollutant listed in Table 6 of part 132 discharged 
by an existing point source into the Great Lakes System, if:

[[Page 696]]

    a. There is insufficient data to calculate a Tier I criterion or 
Tier II value for aquatic life for such pollutant;
    b. The permittee has demonstrated through a biological assessment 
that there are no acute or chronic effects on aquatic life in the 
receiving water; and
    c. The permittee has demonstrated in accordance with procedure 6 of 
this appendix that the whole effluent does not exhibit acute or chronic 
toxicity.
    3. Nothing in sections C.1 or C.2 of this procedure shall preclude 
or deny the right of a permitting authority to:
    a. Determine, in the absence of the data necessary to derive a Tier 
II value, that the discharge of the pollutant will cause, have the 
reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion above a 
narrative criterion for water quality; and
    b. Incorporate a WQBEL for the pollutant into an NPDES permit.
    4. If the permitting authority develops a WQBEL consistent with 
section C.3 of this procedure, and the permitting authority demonstrates 
that the WQBEL developed under section C.3 of this procedure is at least 
as stringent as a WQBEL that would have been based upon the Tier II 
value or values for that pollutant, the permitting authority shall not 
be obligated to generate or require the permittee to generate the data 
necessary to derive a Tier II value or values for that pollutant.
    D. Consideration of Intake Pollutants in Determining Reasonable 
Potential.
    1. General.
    a. Any procedures adopted by a State or Tribe for considering intake 
pollutants in water quality-based permitting shall be consistent with 
this section and section E.
    b. The determinations under this section and section E shall be made 
on a pollutant-by-pollutant, outfall-by-outfall, basis.
    c. This section and section E apply only in the absence of a TMDL 
applicable to the discharge prepared by the State or Tribe and approved 
by EPA, or prepared by EPA pursuant to 40 CFR 130.7(d), or in the 
absence of an assessment and remediation plan submitted and approved in 
accordance with procedure 3.A. of appendix F. This section and section E 
do not alter the permitting authority's obligation under 40 CFR 
122.44(d)(vii)(B) to develop effluent limitations consistent with the 
assumptions and requirements of any available WLA for the discharge, 
which is part of a TMDL prepared by the State or Tribe and approved by 
EPA pursuant to 40 CFR 130.7, or prepared by EPA pursuant to 40 CFR 
130.7(d).
    2. Definition of Same Body of Water.
    a. This definition applies to this section and section E of this 
procedure.
    b. An intake pollutant is considered to be from the same body of 
water as the discharge if the permitting authority finds that the intake 
pollutant would have reached the vicinity of the outfall point in the 
receiving water within a reasonable period had it not been removed by 
the permittee. This finding may be deemed established if:
    i. The background concentration of the pollutant in the receiving 
water (excluding any amount of the pollutant in the facility's 
discharge) is similar to that in the intake water;
    ii. There is a direct hydrological connection between the intake and 
discharge points; and
    iii. Water quality characteristics (e.g., temperature, Ph, hardness) 
are similar in the intake and receiving waters.
    c. The permitting authority may also consider other site-specific 
factors relevant to the transport and fate of the pollutant to make the 
finding in a particular case that a pollutant would or would not have 
reached the vicinity of the outfall point in the receiving water within 
a reasonable period had it not been removed by the permittee.
    d. An intake pollutant from groundwater may be considered to be from 
the same body of water if the permitting authority determines that the 
pollutant would have reached the vicinity of the outfall point in the 
receiving water within a reasonable period had it not been removed by 
the permittee, except that such a pollutant is not from the same body of 
water if the groundwater contains the pollutant partially or entirely 
due to human activity, such as industrial, commercial, or municipal 
operations, disposed actions, or treatment processes.
    e. An intake pollutant is the amount of a pollutant that is present 
in waters of the United States (including groundwater as provided in 
section D.2.d of this procedure) at the time it is withdrawn from such 
waters by the discharger or other facility (e.g., public water supply) 
supplying the discharger with intake water.
    3. Reasonable Potential Determination.
    a. The permitting authority may use the procedure described in this 
section of procedure 5 in lieu of procedures 5.A through C provided the 
conditions specified below are met.
    b. The permitting authority may determine that there is no 
reasonable potential for the discharge of an identified intake pollutant 
or pollutant parameter to cause or contribute to an excursion above a 
narrative or numeric water quality criterion within an applicable water 
quality standard where a discharger demonstrates to the satisfaction of 
the permitting authority (based upon information provided in the permit 
application or other information deemed necessary by the permitting 
authority) that:
    i. The facility withdraws 100 percent of the intake water containing 
the pollutant from the same body of water into which the discharge is 
made;

[[Page 697]]

    ii. The facility does not contribute any additional mass of the 
identified intake pollutant to its wastewater;
    iii. The facility does not alter the identified intake pollutant 
chemically or physically in a manner that would cause adverse water 
quality impacts to occur that would not occur if the pollutants were 
left in-stream;
    iv. The facility does not increase the identified intake pollutant 
concentration, as defined by the permitting authority, at the edge of 
the mixing zone, or at the point of discharge if a mixing zone is not 
allowed, as compared to the pollutant concentration in the intake water, 
unless the increased concentration does not cause or contribute to an 
excursion above an applicable water quality standard; and
    v. The timing and location of the discharge would not cause adverse 
water quality impacts to occur that would not occur if the identified 
intake pollutant were left in-stream.
    c. Upon a finding under section D.3.b of this procedure that a 
pollutant in the discharge does not cause, have the reasonable potential 
to cause, or contribute to an excursion above an applicable water 
quality standard, the permitting authority is not required to include a 
WQBEL for the identified intake pollutant in the facility's permit, 
provided:
    i. The NPDES permit fact sheet or statement of basis includes a 
specific determination that there is no reasonable potential for the 
discharge of an identified intake pollutant to cause or contribute to an 
excursion above an applicable narrative or numeric water quality 
criterion and references appropriate supporting documentation included 
in the administrative record;
    ii. The permit requires all influent, effluent, and ambient 
monitoring necessary to demonstrate that the conditions in section D.3.b 
of this procedure are maintained during the permit term; and
    iii. The permit contains a reopener clause authorizing modification 
or revocation and reissuance of the permit if new information indicates 
changes in the conditions in section D.3.b of this procedure.
    d. Absent a finding under section D.3.b of this procedure that a 
pollutant in the discharge does not cause, have the reasonable potential 
to cause, or contribute to an excursion above an applicable water 
quality standard, the permitting authority shall use the procedures 
under sections 5.A through C of this procedure to determine whether a 
discharge causes, has the reasonable potential to cause, or contribute 
to an excursion above an applicable narrative or numeric water quality 
criterion.
    E. Consideration of Intake Pollutants in Establishing WQBELs.
    1. General. This section applies only when the concentration of the 
pollutant of concern upstream of the discharge (as determined using the 
provisions in procedure 3.B.9 of appendix F) exceeds the most stringent 
applicable water quality criterion for that pollutant.
    2. The requirements of sections D.1-D.2 of this procedure shall also 
apply to this section.
    3. Intake Pollutants from the Same Body of Water.
    a. In cases where a facility meets the conditions in sections 
D.3.b.i and D.3.b.iii through D.3.b.v of this procedure, the permitting 
authority may establish effluent limitations allowing the facility to 
discharge a mass and concentration of the pollutant that are no greater 
than the mass and concentration of the pollutant identified in the 
facility's intake water (``no net addition limitations''). The permit 
shall specify how compliance with mass and concentration limitations 
shall be assessed. No permit may authorize ``no net addition 
limitations'' which are effective after March 23, 2007. After that date, 
WQBELs shall be established in accordance with procedure 5.F.2 of 
appendix F.
    b. Where proper operation and maintenance of a facility's treatment 
system results in removal of a pollutant, the permitting authority may 
establish limitations that reflect the lower mass and/or concentration 
of the pollutant achieved by such treatment, taking into account the 
feasibility of establishing such limits.
    c. For pollutants contained in intake water provided by a water 
system, the concentration of the intake pollutant shall be determined at 
the point where the raw water supply is removed from the same body of 
water, except that it shall be the point where the water enters the 
water supplier's distribution system where the water treatment system 
removes any of the identified pollutants from the raw water supply. Mass 
shall be determined by multiplying the concentration of the pollutant 
determined in accordance with this paragraph by the volume of the 
facility's intake flow received from the water system.
    4. Intake Pollutants from a Different Body of Water. Where the 
pollutant in a facility's discharge originates from a water of the 
United States that is not the same body of water as the receiving water 
(as determined in accordance with section D.2 of this procedure), WQBELs 
shall be established based upon the most stringent applicable water 
quality criterion for that pollutant.
    5. Multiple Sources of Intake Pollutants. Where a facility 
discharges intake pollutants that originate in part from the same body 
of water, and in part from a different body of water, the permitting 
authority may apply the procedures of sections E.3 and E.4 of this 
procedure to derive an effluent limitation reflecting the flow-weighted 
average of each

[[Page 698]]

source of the pollutant, provided that adequate monitoring to determine 
compliance can be established and is included in the permit.
    F. Other Applicable Conditions.
    1. In addition to the above procedures, effluent limitations shall 
be established to comply with all other applicable State, Tribal and 
Federal laws and regulations, including technology-based requirements 
and antidegradation policies.
    2. Once the permitting authority has determined in accordance with 
this procedure that a WQBEL must be included in an NPDES permit, the 
permitting authority shall:
    a. Rely upon the WLA established for the point source either as part 
of any TMDL prepared under procedure 3 of this appendix and approved by 
EPA pursuant to 40 CFR 130.7, or as part of an assessment and 
remediation plan developed and approved in accordance with procedure 3.A 
of this appendix, or, in the absence of such TMDL or plan, calculate 
WLAs for the protection of acute and chronic aquatic life, wildlife and 
human health consistent with the provisions referenced in section A.1 of 
this procedure for developing preliminary wasteload allocations, and
    b. Develop effluent limitations consistent with these WLAs in 
accordance with existing State or Tribal procedures for converting WLAs 
into WQBELs.
    3. When determining whether WQBELs are necessary, information from 
chemical-specific, whole effluent toxicity and biological assessments 
shall be considered independently.
    4. If the geometric mean of a pollutant in fish tissue samples 
collected from a waterbody exceeds the tissue basis of a Tier I 
criterion or Tier II value, after consideration of the variability of 
the pollutant's bioconcentration and bioaccumulation in fish, each 
facility that discharges detectable levels of such pollutant to that 
water has the reasonable potential to cause or contribute to an 
excursion above a Tier I criteria or a Tier II value and the permitting 
authority shall establish a WQBEL for such pollutant in the NPDES permit 
for such facility.

            Procedure 6: Whole Effluent Toxicity Requirements

    The Great Lakes States and Tribes shall adopt provisions consistent 
with (as protective as) procedure 6 of appendix F of part 132.
    The following definitions apply to this part:
    Acute toxic unit (TU<INF>a). 100/LC<INF>50 where the LC<INF>50 is 
expressed as a percent effluent in the test medium of an acute whole 
effluent toxicity (WET) test that is statistically or graphically 
estimated to be lethal to 50 percent of the test organisms.
    Chronic toxic unit (TU<INF>c). 100/NOEC or 100/IC<INF>25, where the 
NOEC and IC<INF>25 are expressed as a percent effluent in the test 
medium.
    Inhibition concentration 25 (IC<INF>25). the toxicant concentration 
that would cause a 25 percent reduction in a non-quantal biological 
measurement for the test population. For example, the IC<INF>25 is the 
concentration of toxicant that would cause a 25 percent reduction in 
mean young per female or in growth for the test population.
    No observed effect concentration (NOEC). The highest concentration 
of toxicant to which organisms are exposed in a full life-cycle or 
partial life-cycle (short-term) test, that causes no observable adverse 
effects on the test organisms (i.e., the highest concentration of 
toxicant in which the values for the observed responses are not 
statistically significantly different from the controls).
    A. Whole Effluent Toxicity Requirements. The Great Lakes States and 
Tribes shall adopt whole effluent toxicity provisions consistent with 
the following:
    1. A numeric acute WET criterion of 0.3 acute toxic units (TU<INF>a) 
measured pursuant to test methods in 40 CFR part 136, or a numeric 
interpretation of a narrative criterion establishing that 0.3 TU<INF>a 
measured pursuant to test methods in 40 CFR part 136 is necessary to 
protect aquatic life from acute effects of WET. At the discretion of the 
permitting authority, the foregoing requirement shall not apply in an 
acute mixing zone that is sized in accordance with EPA-approved State 
and Tribal methods.
    2. A numeric chronic WET criterion of one chronic toxicity unit 
(TU<INF>c) measured pursuant to test methods in 40 CFR part 136, or a 
numeric interpretation of a narrative criterion establishing that one 
TU<INF>c measured pursuant to test methods in 40 CFR part 136 is 
necessary to protect aquatic life from the chronic effects of WET. At 
the discretion of the permitting authority, the foregoing requirements 
shall not apply within a chronic mixing zone consistent with: (a) 
procedures 3.D.1 and 3.D.4, for discharges to the open of the Great 
Lakes (OWGL), inland lakes and other waters of the Great Lakes System 
with no appreciable flow relative to their volume, or (b) procedure 
3.E.5 for discharges to tributaries and connecting channels of the Great 
Lakes System.
    B. WET Test Methods. All WET tests performed to implement or 
ascertain compliance with this procedure shall be performed in 
accordance with methods established in 40 CFR part 136.
    C. Permit Conditions.
    1. Where a permitting authority determines pursuant to section D of 
this procedure that the WET of an effluent is or may be discharged at a 
level that will cause, have the reasonable potential to cause, or 
contribute to an excursion above any numeric WET criterion or narrative 
criterion within a

[[Page 699]]

State's or Tribe's water quality standards, the permitting authority:
    a. Shall (except as provided in section C.1.e of this procedure) 
establish a water quality-based effluent limitation (WQBEL) or WQBELs 
for WET consistent with section C.1.b of this procedure;
    b. Shall calculate WQBELs pursuant to section C.1.a. of this 
procedure to ensure attainment of the State's or Tribe's chronic WET 
criteria under receiving water flow conditions described in procedures 
3.E.1.a (or where applicable, with procedure 3.E.1.e) for Great Lakes 
System tributaries and connecting channels, and with mixing zones no 
larger than allowed pursuant to section A.2. of this procedure. Shall 
calculate WQBELs to ensure attainment of the State's or Tribe's acute 
WET criteria under receiving water flow conditions described in 
procedure 3.E.1.b (or where applicable, with procedure 3.E.1.e) for 
Great Lakes System tributaries and connecting channels, with an 
allowance for mixing zones no greater than specified pursuant to section 
A.1 of this procedure.
    c. May specify in the NPDES permit the conditions under which a 
permittee would be required to perform a toxicity reduction evaluation.
    d. May allow with respect to any WQBEL established pursuant to 
section C.1.a of this procedure an appropriate schedule of compliance 
consistent with procedure 9 of appendix F; and
    e. May decide on a case-by-case basis that a WQBEL for WET is not 
necessary if the State's or Tribe's water quality standards do not 
contain a numeric criterion for WET, and the permitting authority 
demonstrates in accordance with 40 CFR 122.44(d)(1)(v) that chemical-
specific effluent limits are sufficient to ensure compliance with 
applicable criteria.
    2. Where a permitting authority lacks sufficient information to 
determine pursuant to section D of this procedure whether the WET of an 
effluent is or may be discharged at levels that will cause, have the 
reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion above any 
numeric WET criterion or narrative criterion within a State's or Tribe's 
water quality standards, then the permitting authority should consider 
including in the NPDES permit appropriate conditions to require 
generation of additional data and to control toxicity if found, such as:
    a. WET testing requirements to generate the data needed to 
adequately characterize the toxicity of the effluent to aquatic life;
    b. Language requiring a permit reopener clause to establish WET 
limits if any toxicity testing data required pursuant to section C.2.a 
of this procedure indicate that the WET of an effluent is or may be 
discharged at levels that will cause, have the reasonable potential to 
cause, or contribute to an excursion above any numeric WET criterion or 
narrative criterion within a State's or Tribe's water quality standards.
    3. Where sufficient data are available for a permitting authority to 
determine pursuant to section D of this procedure that the WET of an 
effluent neither is nor may be discharged at a level that will cause, 
have the reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion 
above any numeric WET criterion or narrative criterion within a State's 
or Tribe's water quality standards, the permitting authority may include 
conditions and limitations described in section C.2 of this procedure at 
its discretion.
    D. Reasonable Potential Determinations. The permitting authority 
shall take into account the factors described in 40 CFR 122.44(d)(1)(ii) 
and, where representative facility-specific WET effluent data are 
available, apply the following requirements in determining whether the 
WET of an effluent is or may be discharged at a level that will cause, 
have the reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion 
above any numeric WET criterion or narrative criterion within a State's 
or Tribe's water quality standards.
    1. The permitting authority shall characterize the toxicity of the 
discharge by:
    a. Either averaging or using the maximum of acute toxicity values 
collected within the same day for each species to represent one daily 
value. The maximum of all daily values for the most sensitive species 
tested is used for reasonable potential determinations;
    b. Either averaging or using the maximum of chronic toxicity values 
collected within the same calendar month for each species to represent 
one monthly value. The maximum of such values, for the most sensitive 
species tested, is used for reasonable potential determinations:
    c. Estimating the toxicity values for the missing endpoint using a 
default acute-chronic ratio (ACR) of 10, when data exist for either 
acute WET or chronic WET, but not for both endpoints.
    2. The WET of an effluent is or may be discharged at a level that 
will cause, have the reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an 
excursion above any numeric acute WET criterion or numeric 
interpretation of a narrative criterion within a State's or

[[Page 700]]

Tribe's water quality standards, when effluent-specific information 
demonstrates that:

(TU<INF>a effluent) (B) (effluent flow/(Qad+effluent flow))>AC

Where TU<INF>a effluent is the maximum measured acute toxicity of 100 
percent effluent determined pursuant to section D.1.a. of this 
procedure, B is the multiplying factor taken from Table F6-1 of this 
procedure to convert the highest measured effluent toxicity value to the 
estimated 95th percentile toxicity value for the discharge, effluent 
flow is the same effluent flow used to calculate the preliminary 
wasteload allocations (WLAs) for individual pollutants to meet the acute 
criteria and values for those pollutants, AC is the numeric acute WET 
criterion or numeric interpretation of a narrative criterion established 
pursuant to section A.1 of this procedure and expressed in TU<INF>a, and 
Qad is the amount of the receiving water available for dilution 
calculated using: (i) the specified design flow(s) for tributaries and 
connecting channels in section C.1.b of this procedure, or where 
appropriate procedure 3.E.1.e of appendix F, and using EPA-approved 
State and Tribal procedures for establishing acute mixing zones in 
tributaries and connecting channels, or (ii) the EPA-approved State and 
Tribal procedures for establishing acute mixing zones in OWGLs. Where 
there are less than 10 individual WET tests, the multiplying factor 
taken from Table F6-1 of this procedure shall be based on a coefficient 
of variation (CV) or 0.6. Where there are 10 or more individual WET 
tests, the multiplying factor taken from Table F6-1 shall be based on a 
CV calculated as the standard deviation of the acute toxicity values 
found in the WET tests divided by the arithmetic mean of those toxicity 
values.
    3. The WET of an effluent is or may be discharged at a level that 
will cause, have the reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an 
excursion above any numeric chronic WET criterion or numeric 
interpretation of a narrative criterion within a State's or Tribe's 
water quality standards, when effluent-specific information demonstrates 
that:

(TU<INF>c effluent) (B) (effluent flow/Qad+effluent flow))>CC

Where TU<INF>c effluent is the maximum measured chronic toxicity value 
of 100 percent effluent determined in accordance with section D.1.b. of 
this procedure, B is the multiplying factor taken from Table F6-1 of 
this procedure, effluent flow is the same effluent flow used to 
calculate the preliminary WLAs for individual pollutants to meet the 
chronic criteria and values for those pollutants, CC is the numeric 
chronic WET criterion or numeric interpretation of a narrative criterion 
established pursuant to section A.2 of this procedure and expressed in 
TU<INF>c, and Qad is the amount of the receiving water available for 
dilution calculated using: (i) the design flow(s) for tributaries and 
connecting channels specified in procedure 3.E.1.a of appendix F, and 
where appropriate procedure 3.E.1.e of appendix F, and in accordance 
with the provisions of procedure 3.E.5 for chronic mixing zones, or (ii) 
procedures 3.D.1 and 3.D.4 for discharges to the OWGLs. Where there are 
less than 10 individual WET tests, the multiplying factor taken from 
Table F6-1 of this procedure shall be based on a CV of 0.6. Where there 
are 10 more individual WET tests, the multiplying factor taken from 
Table F6-1 of this procedure shall be based on a CV calculated as the 
standard deviation of the WET tests divided by the arithmetic mean of 
the WET tests.

                       Procedure 7: Loading Limits

    The Great Lakes States and Tribes shall adopt provisions consistent 
with (as protective as) this procedure.
    Whenever a water quality-based effluent limitation (WQBEL) is 
developed, the WQBEL shall be expressed as both a concentration value 
and a corresponding mass loading rate.
    A. Both mass and concentration limits shall be based on the same 
permit averaging periods such as daily, weekly, or monthly averages, or 
in other appropriate permit averaging periods.
    B. The mass loading rates shall be calculated using effluent flow 
rates that are consistent with those used in establishing the WQBELs 
expressed in concentration.

    Procedure 8: Water Quality-based Effluent Limitations Below the 
                          Quantification Level

    The Great Lakes States and Tribes shall adopt provisions consistent 
with (as protective as) this procedure.
    When a water quality-based effluent limitation (WQBEL) for a 
pollutant is calculated to be less than the quantification level:
    A. Permit Limits. The permitting authority shall designate as the 
limit in the NPDES permit the WQBEL exactly as calculated.
    B. Analytical Method and Quantification Level.
    1. The permitting authority shall specify in the permit the most 
sensitive, applicable, analytical method, specified in or approved under 
40 CFR part 136, or other appropriate method if one is not available 
under 40 CFR part 136, to be used to monitor for the presence and amount 
in an effluent of the pollutant for which the WQBEL is established; and 
shall specify in accordance with section B.2 of this procedure, the 
quantification level that can be achieved by use of the specified 
analytical method.
    2. The quantification level shall be the minimum level (ML) 
specified in or approved under 40 CFR part 136 for the method for that 
pollutant. If no such ML exists, or if the method is not specified or 
approved under 40 CFR part 136, the quantification level shall be the 
lowest quantifiable level practicable. The permitting authority may 
specify a higher quantification level if the permittee demonstrates that 
a higher quantification level is appropriate because of effluent-
specific matrix interference.
    3. The permit shall state that, for the purpose of compliance 
assessment, the analytical method specified in the permit shall be used 
to monitor the amount of pollutant in an effluent down to the 
quantification level, provided that the analyst has complied with

[[Page 702]]

the specified quality assurance/quality control procedures in the 
relevant method.
    4. The permitting authority shall use applicable State and Tribal 
procedures to average and account for monitoring data. The permitting 
authority may specify in the permit the value to be used to interpret 
sample values below the quantification level.
    C. Special Conditions. The permit shall contain a reopener clause 
authorizing modification or revocation and reissuance of the permit if 
new information generated as a result of special conditions included in 
the permit indicates that presence of the pollutant in the discharge at 
levels above the WQBEL. Special conditions that may be included in the 
permit include, but are not limited to, fish tissue sampling, whole 
effluent toxicity (WET) tests, limits and/or monitoring requirements on 
internal waste streams, and monitoring for surrogate parameters. Data 
generated as a result of special conditions can be used to reopen the 
permit to establish more stringent effluent limits or conditions, if 
necessary.
    D. Pollutant Minimization Program. The permitting authority shall 
include a condition in the permit requiring the permittee to develop and 
conduct a pollutant minimization program for each pollutant with a WQBEL 
below the quantification level. The goal of the pollutant minimization 
program shall be to reduce all potential sources of the pollutant to 
maintain the effluent at or below the WQBEL. In addition, States and 
Tribes may consider cost-effectiveness when establishing the 
requirements of a PMP. The pollutant minimization program shall include, 
but is not limited to, the following:
    1. An annual review and semi-annual monitoring of potential sources 
of the pollutant, which may include fish tissue monitoring and other 
bio-uptake sampling;
    2. Quarterly monitoring for the pollutant in the influent to the 
wastewater treatment system;
    3. Submittal of a control strategy designed to proceed toward the 
goal of maintaining all sources of the pollutant to the wastewater 
collection system below the WQBEL;
    4. When the sources of the pollutant are discovered, appropriate 
cost-effective control measures shall be implemented, consistent with 
the control strategy; and
    5. An annual status report that shall be sent to the permitting 
authority including:
    a. All minimization program monitoring results for the previous 
year;
    b. A list of potential sources of the pollutant; and
    c. A summary of all action taken to reduce or eliminate the 
identified sources of the pollutant.
    6. Any information generated as a result of procedure 8.D can be 
used to support a request for subsequent permit modifications, including 
revisions to (e.g., more or less frequent monitoring), or removal of the 
requirements of procedure 8.D, consistent with 40 CFR 122.44, 122.62 and 
122.63.

                    Procedure 9: Compliance Schedules

    The Great Lakes States and Tribes shall adopt provisions consistent 
with (as protective as) procedure 9 of appendix F of part 132.
    A. Limitations for New Great Lakes Dischargers. When a permit issued 
on or after March 23, 1997 to a new Great Lakes discharger (defined in 
Part 132.2) contains a water quality-based effluent limitation (WQBEL), 
the permittee shall comply with such a limitation upon the commencement 
of the discharge.
    B. Limitations for Existing Great Lakes Dischargers.
    1. Any existing permit that is reissued or modified on or after 
March 23, 1997 to contain a new or more restrictive WQBEL may allow a 
reasonable period of time, up to five years from the date of permit 
issuance or modification, for the permittee to comply with that limit, 
provided that the Tier I criterion or whole effluent toxicity (WET) 
criterion was adopted (or, in the case of a narrative criterion, Tier II 
value, or Tier I criterion derived pursuant to the methodology in 
appendix A of part 132, was newly derived) after July 1, 1977.
    2. When the compliance schedule established under paragraph 1 goes 
beyond the term of the permit, an interim permit limit effective upon 
the expiration date shall be included in the permit and addressed in the 
permit's fact sheet or statement of basis. The administrative record for 
the permit shall reflect the final limit and its compliance date.
    3. If a permit establishes a schedule of compliance under paragraph 
1 which exceeds one year from the date of permit issuance or 
modification, the schedule shall set forth interim requirements and 
dates for their achievement. The time between such interim dates may not 
exceed one year. If the time necessary for completion of any interim 
requirement is more than one year and is not readily divisible into 
stages for completion, the permit shall require, at a minimum, specified 
dates for annual submission of progress reports on the status of any 
interim requirements.
    C. Delayed Effectiveness of Tier II Limitations for Existing Great 
Lakes Discharges.
    1. Whenever a limit (calculated in accordance with Procedure 3) 
based upon a Tier II value is included in a reissued or modified permit 
for an existing Great Lakes discharger, the permit may provide a 
reasonable period of time, up to two years, in which to provide 
additional studies necessary to develop a Tier I criterion or to modify 
the Tier II value. In such cases, the permit shall require compliance 
with the Tier II limitation within a reasonable period of time, no later

[[Page 703]]

than five years after permit issuance or modification, and contain a 
reopener clause.
    2. The reopener clause shall authorize permit modifications if 
specified studies have been completed by the permittee or provided by a 
third-party during the time allowed to conduct the specified studies, 
and the permittee or a third-party demonstrates, through such studies, 
that a revised limit is appropriate. Such a revised limit shall be 
incorporated through a permit modification and a reasonable time period, 
up to five years, shall be allowed for compliance. If incorporated prior 
to the compliance date of the original Tier II limitation, any such 
revised limit shall not be considered less-stringent for purposes of the 
anti-backsliding provisions of section 402(o) of the Clean Water Act.
    3. If the specified studies have been completed and do not 
demonstrate that a revised limit is appropriate, the permitting 
authority may provide a reasonable additional period of time, not to 
exceed five years with which to achieve compliance with the original 
effluent limitation.
    4. Where a permit is modified to include new or more stringent 
limitations, on a date within five years of the permit expiration date, 
such compliance schedules may extend beyond the term of a permit 
consistent with section B.2 of this procedure.
    5. If future studies (other than those conducted under paragraphs 1, 
2, or 3 above) result in a Tier II value being changed to a less 
stringent Tier II value or Tier I criterion, after the effective date of 
a Tier II-based limit, the existing Tier II-based limit may be revised 
to be less stringent if:
    (a) It complies with sections 402(o) (2) and (3) of the CWA; or,
    (b) In non-attainment waters, where the existing Tier II limit was 
based on procedure 3, the cumulative effect of revised effluent 
limitation based on procedure 3 of this appendix will assure compliance 
with water quality standards; or,
    (c) In attained waters, the revised effluent limitation complies 
with the State or Tribes' antidegradation policy and procedures.

<R05>
Sec. 133.102  Secondary treatment.

    The following paragraphs describe the minimum level of effluent 
quality attainable by secondary treatment in terms of the parameters--
BOD<INF>5, SS and pH. All requirements for each parameter shall be 
achieved except as provided for in Secs.  133.103 and 133.105.
    (a) BOD<INF>5.
    (1) The 30-day average shall not exceed 30 mg/l.
    (2) The 7-day average shall not exceed 45 mg/l.
    (3) The 30-day average percent removal shall not be less than 85 
percent.
    (4) At the option of the NPDES permitting authority, in lieu of the 
parameter BOD<INF>5 and the levels of the effluent quality specified in 
paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) and (a)(3), the parameter CBOD<INF>5 may be 
substituted with the following levels of the CBOD<INF>5 effluent quality 
provided:
    (i) The 30-day average shall not exceed 25 mg/l.
    (ii) The 7-day average shall not exceed 40 mg/l.

limits of 6.0 to 9.0 unless the publicly owned treatment works 
demonstrates that: (1) Inorganic chemicals are not added to the waste 
stream as part of the treatment process; and (2) contributions from 
industrial sources do not cause the pH of the effluent to be less than 
6.0 or greater than 9.0.

[49 FR 37006, Sept. 20, 1984; 49 FR 40405, Oct. 16, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 133.103   Special considerations.

    (a) Combined sewers. Treatment works subject to this part may not be 
capable of meeting the percentage removal requirements established under 
Secs. 133.102(a)(3) and 133.102(b)(3), or Secs. 133.105(a)(3) and 
133.105(b)(3) during wet weather where the treatment works receive flows 
from combined sewers (i.e., sewers which are designed to transport both 
storm water and sanitary sewage). For such treatment works, the decision 
must be made on a case-by-case basis as to whether any attainable 
percentage removal level

[[Page 705]]

can be defined, and if so, what the level should be.
    (b) Industrial wastes.  For certain industrial categories, the 
discharge to navigable waters of BOD<INF>5 and SS permitted under 
sections 301(b)(1)(A)(i), (b)(2)(E) or 306 of the Act may be less 
stringent than the values given in Secs. 133.102(a)(1), 
133.102(a)(4)(i), 133.102(b)(1), 133.105(a)(1), 133.105(b)(1) and 
133.105(e)(1)(i). In cases when wastes would be introduced from such an 
industrial category into a publicly owned treatment works, the values 
for BOD<INF>5 and SS in Secs. 133.102(a)(1), 133.102(a)(4)(i),  
133.102(b)(1),  133.105(a)(1),  133.105(b)(1), and 133.105(e)(1)(i) may 
be adjusted upwards provided that: (1) The permitted discharge of such 
pollutants, attributable to the industrial category, would not be 
greater than that which would be permitted under sections 
301(b)(1)(A)(i), 301(b)(2)(E) or 306 of the Act if such industrial 
category were to discharge directly into the navigable waters, and (2) 
the flow or loading of such pollutants introduced by the industrial 
category exceeds 10 percent of the design flow or loading of the 
publicly owned treatment works. When such an adjustment is made, the 
values for BOD<INF>5 or SS in Secs. 133.102(a)(2),  133.102(a)(4)(ii),  
Sec. 133.102(b)(2),  133.105(a)(2),  133.105(b)(2), and 
133.105(e)(1)(ii) should be adjusted proportionately.
    (c) Waste stabilization ponds. The Regional Administrator, or, if 
appropriate, State Director subject to EPA approval, is authorized to 
adjust the minimum levels of effluent quality set forth in Sec. 133.105 
(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) for treatment works subject to this part, to 
conform to the SS concentrations achievable with waste stabilization 
ponds, provided that: (1) Waste stablization ponds are the principal 
process used for secondary treatment; and (2) operation and maintenance 
data indicate that the SS values specified in Sec. 133.105 (b)(1), 
(b)(2), and (b)(3) cannot be achieved. The term ``SS concentrations 
achievable with waste stabilization ponds'' means a SS value, determined 
by the Regional Administrator, or, if appropriate, State Director 
subject to EPA approval, which is equal to the effluent concentration 
achieved 90 percent of the time within a State or appropriate contiguous 
geographical area by waste stabilization ponds that are achieving the 
levels of effluent quality for BOD<INF>5 specified in 
Sec. 133.105(a)(1). [cf. 43 FR 55279].
    (d) Less concentrated influent wastewater for separate sewers. The 
Regional Administrator or, if appropriate, State Director is authorized 
to substitute either a lower percent removal requirement or a mass 
loading limit for the percent removal requirements set forth in 
Secs. 133.102(a)(3), 133.102(a)(4)(iii),  133.102(b)(3),  102.105(a)(3), 
 133.105(b)(3) and 133.105(e)(1)(iii)  provided that the permittee 
satisfactorily demonstrates that: (1) The treatment works is 
consistently meeting, or will consistently meet, its permit effluent 
concentration limits but its percent removal requirements cannot be met 
due to less concentrated influent wastewater, (2) to meet the percent 
removal requirements, the treatment works would have to achieve 
significantly more stringent limitations than would otherwise be 
required by the concentration-based standards, and (3) the less 
concentrated influent wastewater is not the result of excessive I/I. The 
determination of whether the less concentrated wastewater is the result 
of excessive I/I will use the definition of excessive I/I in 40 CFR 
35.2005(b)(16) plus the additional criterion that inflow is nonexcessive 
if the total flow to the POTW (i.e., wastewater plus inflow plus 
infiltration) is less than 275 gallons per capita per day.
    (e) Less concentrated influent wastewater for combined sewers during 
dry weather. The Regional Administrator or, if appropriate, the State 
Director is authorized to substitute either a lower percent removal 
requirement or a mass loading limit for the percent removal requirements 
set forth in Secs. 133.102(a)(3), 133.102(a)(4)(iii),  133.102(b)(3),  
133.105(a)(3), 133.105(b)(3) and 133.105(e)(1)(iii) provided that the 
permittee satisfactorily demonstrates that: (1) The treatment works is 
consistently meeting, or will consistently meet, its permit effluent 
concentration limits, but the percent removal requirements cannot be met 
due to less concentrated influent

[[Page 706]]

wastewater; (2) to meet the percent removal requirements, the treatment 
works would have to achieve significantly more stringent effluent 
concentrations than would otherwise be required by the concentration-
based standards; and (3) the less concentrated influent wastewater does 
not result from either excessive infiltration or clear water industrial 
discharges during dry weather periods. The determination of whether the 
less concentrated wastewater results from excessive infiltration is 
discussed in 40 CFR 35.2005(b)(28), plus the additional criterion that 
either 40 gallons per capita per day (gpcd) or 1500 gallons per inch 
diameter per mile of sewer (gpdim) may be used as the threshold value 
for that portion of the dry weather base flow attributed to 
infiltration. If the less concentrated influent wastewater is the result 
of clear water industrial discharges, then the treatment works must 
control such discharges pursuant to 40 CFR part 403.

Sec. 133.105  Treatment equivalent to secondary treatment.

    This section describes the minimum level of effluent quality 
attainable by facilities eligible for treatment equivalent to secondary 
treatment (Sec. 133.101(g)) in terms of the parameters--BOD<INF>5, SS 
and pH. All requirements for the specified parameters in paragraphs (a), 
(b) and (c) of this section shall be achieved except as provided for in 
Sec. 133.103, or paragraphs (d), (e) or (f) of this section.
    (a) BOD<INF>5. (1) The 30-day average shall not exceed 45 mg/l.
    (2) The 7-day average shall not exceed 65 mg/l.
    (3) The 30-day average percent removal shall not be less than 65 
percent.
    (b) SS. Except where SS values have been adjusted in accordance with 
Sec. 133.103(c):
    (1) The 30-day average shall not exceed 45 mg/l.
    (2) The 7-day average shall not exceed 65 mg/l.
    (3) The 30-day average percent removal shall not be less than 65 
percent.
    (c) pH. The requirements of Sec. 133.102(c) shall be met.
    (d) Alternative State requirements. Except as limited by paragraph 
(f) of this section, and after notice and opportunity for public 
comment, the Regional Administrator, or, if appropriate, State Director 
subject to EPA approval, is authorized to adjust the minimum levels of 
effluent quality set forth in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (b)(1) and 
(b)(2) of this section for trickling filter facilities and in paragraphs 
(a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section for waste stabilization pond 
facilities, to conform to the BOD<INF>5 and SS effluent concentrations 
consistently achievable through proper operation and maintenance 
(Sec. 133.101(f)) by the median (50th percentile) facility in a 
representative sample of facilities within a State or appropriate 
contiguous geographical area that meet the definition of facilities 
eligible for treatment equivalent to secondary treatment 
(Sec. 133.101(g)).

(The information collection requirements contained in this rule have 
been approved by OMB and assigned control number 2040-0051.)

    (e) CBOD<INF>5 limitations:
    (1) Where data are available to establish CBOD<INF>5 limitations for 
a treatment works subject to this section, the NPDES permitting 
authority may substitute the parameter CBOD<INF>5 for the parameter 
BOD<INF>5 In Secs. 133.105(a)(1), 133.105(a)(2) and 133.105(a)(3), on a 
case-by-case basis provided that the levels of CBOD<INF>5 effluent 
quality are not less stringent than the following:
    (i) The 30-day average shall not exceed 40 mg/l.
    (ii) The 7-days average shall not exceed 60 mg/l.
    (iii) The 30-day average percent removal shall not be less than 65 
percent.

[[Page 707]]

    (2) Where data are available, the parameter CBOD<INF>5 may be used 
for effluent quality limitations established under paragraph (d) of this 
section. Where concurrent BOD effluent data are available, they must be 
submitted with the CBOD data as a part of the approval process outlined 
in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (f) Permit adjustments. Any permit adjustment made pursuant to this 
part may not be any less stringent than the limitations required 
pursuant to Sec. 133.105(a)-(e). Furthermore, permitting authorities 
shall require more stringent limitations when adjusting permits if: (1) 
For existing facilities the permitting authority determines that the 30-
day average and 7-day average BOD<INF>5 and SS effluent values that 
could be achievable through proper operation and maintenance of the 
treatment works, based on an analysis of the past performance of the 
treatment works, would enable the treatment works to achieve more 
stringent limitations, or
    (2) For new facilities, the permitting authority determines that the 
30-day average and 7-day average BOD<INF>5 and SS effluent values that 
could be achievable through proper operation and maintenance of the 
treatment works, considering the design capability of the treatment 
process and geographical and climatic conditions, would enable the 
treatment works to achieve more stringent limitations.
