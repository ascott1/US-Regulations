                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2000), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

For both significant

[[Page 13]]

rulemaking (defined by Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and 
Review and Department of Transportation Order 2100.5, Policies and 
Procedures for Simplification, Analysis, and Review of Regulations) and 
non-significant rulemaking, other than those areas delegated to District 
Commanders and Captains of the Port, the regulatory process begins when 
an office chief with program responsibilities identifies a possible need 
for a new regulation or for changes to an existing regulation. The need 
may arise due to statutory changes, or be based on internal review or 
public input. Early public involvement is strongly encouraged.
    (b) After a tentative regulatory approach is developed, a regulatory 
project proposal is submitted to the Marine Safety Council for approval. 
The proposal describes the scope of the proposed regulation, 
alternatives considered, and potential cost and benefits, including 
possible environmental impacts. All regulatory projects require Marine 
Safety Council approval.
    (c) Significant rulemaking projects must also be approved by the 
Commandant of the Coast Guard.
    (d) If the project is approved, the necessary documents are drafted, 
including documents to be published in the Federal Register. These may 
include regulatory evaluations, environmental analyses, requests for 
comments, announcements of public meetings, notices of proposed 
rulemakings, and final rules.


<R05>
Sec. 1.05-15  Public participation.

    The Coast Guard considers public participation essential to 
effective rulemaking, and encourages the public to participate in its 
rulemaking process. Coast Guard policy is to provide opportunities for 
public participation early in potential rulemaking projects. Generally, 
the Coast Guard will solicit public input by publishing a notice of 
public meeting or request for comments in the Federal Register. Advance 
Notices of Proposed Rulemaking, Notices of Proposed Rulemaking, 
Supplemental Notices of Proposed Rulemaking, and Interim Rules will 
usually provide 90 days, or more if possible, after publication for 
submission of comments. This time period is intended to allow interested 
persons the opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process through 
the submission of written data and views. However, certain cases and 
circumstances may make it necessary to provide a shorter comment period. 
Public meetings may also be held to provide an opportunity for oral 
presentations. The Coast Guard will consider the comments received and, 
in subsequent rulemaking documents, will incorporate a concise general 
statement of the comments received and identify changes from a proposed 
rule based on the comments.


<R05>
Sec. 1.05-20  Petitions for rulemaking.

    (a) Any member of the public may petition the Coast Guard to 
undertake a rulemaking action. There is no prescribed form for a 
petition for rulemaking, but the document should provide some supporting 
information as to why the petitioner believes the proposed rulemaking is 
necessary and the document should clearly indicate that it is a petition 
for rulemaking. Petitions should be addressed to the Executive 
Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G-LRA/3406), United States Coast Guard 
Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001.
    (b) The petitioner will be notified of the Coast Guard's decision 
whether to initiate a rulemaking or not. If the Coast Guard decides not 
to pursue a rulemaking, the petitioner will be notified of the reasons 
why. If the Coast Guard decides to initiate rulemaking, it will follow 
the procedure outlined in this subpart. The Coast Guard may publish a 
notice acknowledging receipt of a petition for rulemaking in the Federal 
Register.
    (c) Any petition for rulemaking and any reply to the petition will 
be kept in a public file open for inspection.


<R05>
Sec. 1.05-25  Public docket.

    (a) A public file is maintained for each petition for rulemaking and 
each Coast Guard regulation and notice published in the Federal 
Register. Each file contains copies of every rulemaking document 
published for the project, public comments received,

[[Page 14]]

summaries of public meetings or hearings, regulatory assessments, and 
other publicly-available information. Members of the public may inspect 
the public docket and copy any documents in the file. Each rulemaking 
document will identify where the public file for that rulemaking is 
maintained.
    (b) The public dockets for Coast Guard rulemaking activity initiated 
by Coast Guard District Commanders are available for public inspection 
at the appropriate Coast Guard District office.
    (c) The public dockets for Coast Guard rulemaking activity initiated 
by Captains of the Port are available for inspection at the appropriate 
Captain of the Port office.


<R05>
Sec. 1.05-30  Advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM).

    An advance notice of proposed rulemaking may be used to alert the 
affected public about a new regulatory project, or when the Coast Guard 
needs more information about what form proposed regulations should take, 
the actual need for a regulation, the cost of a proposal, or any other 
information. The ANPRM may solicit general information or ask the public 
to respond to specific questions.


<R05>
Sec. 1.05-35  Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).

    Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 553, an NPRM 
is generally published in the Federal Register for Coast Guard 
rulemakings. The NPRM normally contains a preamble statement in 
sufficient detail to explain the proposal, its background, basis, and 
purpose, and the various issues involved. It also contains a discussion 
of any comments received in response to prior notices, a citation of 
legal authority for the rule, and the text of the proposed rule.


<R05>
Sec. 1.05-40  Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM).

    An SNPRM may be issued if a proposed rule has been substantially 
changed from the original notice of proposed rulemaking. The 
supplemental notice advises the public of the revised proposal and 
provides an opportunity for additional comment. To give the public a 
reasonable opportunity to become reacquainted with a rulemaking, a 
supplemental notice may also be issued if considerable time has elapsed 
since publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking. An SNPRM contains 
the same type of information generally included in an NPRM.


<R05>
Sec. 1.05-45  Interim rule.

    (a) An interim rule may be issued when it is in the public interest 
to promulgate an effective rule while keeping the rulemaking open for 
further refinement. For example, an interim rule may be issued in 
instances when normal procedures for notice and comment prior to issuing 
an effective rule are not required, minor changes to the final rule may 
be necessary after the interim rule has been in place for some time, or 
the interim rule only implements portions of a proposed rule, while 
other portions of the proposed rule are still under development.
    (b) An interim rule will be published in the Federal Register with 
an effective date that will generally be at least 30 days after the date 
of publication. After the effective date, an interim rule is enforceable 
and is codified in the next annual revision of the appropriate title of 
the Code of Federal Regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 1.05-50  Final rule.

    In some instances, a final rule may be issued without prior notice 
and comment. When notice and comment procedures have been used, and 
after all comments received have been considered, a final rule is 
issued. A final rule document contains a preamble that discusses 
comments received, responses to comments and changes made from the 
proposed or interim rule, a citation of legal authority, and the text of 
the rule.


<R05>
Sec. 1.05-55  Direct final rule.

    (a) A direct final rule may be issued to allow noncontroversial 
rules that are unlikely to result in adverse public comment to become 
effective more quickly.
    (b) A direct final rule will be published in the Federal Register 
with an effective date that is generally at

[[Page 15]]

least 90 days after the date of publication.
    (c) The public will usually be given at least 60 days from the date 
of publication in which to submit comments or notice of intent to submit 
comments.
    (d) If no adverse comment or notice of intent to submit an adverse 
comment is received within the specified period, the Coast Guard will 
publish a notice in the Federal Register to confirm that the rule will 
go into effect as scheduled.
    (e) If the Coast Guard receives a written adverse comment or a 
written notice of intent to submit an adverse comment, the Coast Guard 
will publish a notice in the final rule section of the Federal Register 
to announce withdrawal of the direct final rule. If an adverse comment 
clearly applies to only part of a rule, and it is possible to remove 
that part without affecting the remaining portions, the Coast Guard may 
adopt as final those parts of the rule on which no adverse comment was 
received. Any part of a rule that is the subject of an adverse comment 
will be withdrawn. If the Coast Guard decides to proceed with a 
rulemaking following receipt of an adverse comment, a separate Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) will be published unless an exception to the 
Administrative Procedure Act requirements for notice and comment 
applies.
    (f) A comment is considered adverse if the comment explains why the 
rule would be inappropriate, including a challenge to the rule's 
underlying premise or approach, or would be ineffective or unacceptable 
without a change.

<R05>
Sec. 1.05-60  Negotiated rulemaking.

    (a) The Coast Guard may establish a negotiated rulemaking committee 
under the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990 and the Federal Advisory 
Committee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. App. 2) when it is in the public 
interest.
    (b) Generally, the Coast Guard will consider negotiated rulemaking 
when:
    (1) There is a need for a rule;
    (2) There are a limited number of representatives for identifiable 
parties affected by the rule;
    (3) There is a reasonable chance that balanced representation can be 
reached in the negotiated rulemaking committee and that the committee 
members will negotiate in good faith;
    (4) There is a likelihood of a committee consensus in a fixed time 
period;
    (5) The negotiated rulemaking process will not unreasonably delay 
the rule;
    (6) The Coast Guard has resources to do negotiated rulemaking; and
    (7) The Coast Guard can use the consensus of the committee in 
formulating the NPRM and final rule.

    (c) The term issuing officer means any qualified Coast Guard 
commissioned, warrant, or petty officer.
    (d) The term Notice of Violation means a notification of violation 
and preliminary assessment of penalty, given to a party, in accordance 
with Sec. 1.07-11.

<R05>
Sec. 1.07-10  Reporting and investigation.

    (a) Any person may report an apparent violation of any law, 
regulation, or order that is enforced by the Coast Guard to any Coast 
Guard facility. When a report of an apparent violation has been 
received, or when an apparent violation has been detected by any Coast 
Guard personnel, the matter is investigated or evaluated by Coast Guard 
personnel. Once an apparent violation has been investigated or 
evaluated, a report of the investigation may be sent to the District 
Commander or other designated official in accordance with paragraph (b) 
of this section or a Notice of Violation under Sec. 1.07-11 may be given 
to the party by an issuing officer.
    (b) Reports of any investigation conducted by the Coast Guard or 
received from any other agency which indicate that a violation may have 
occurred may be forwarded to a District Commander or other designated 
official for further action. This is normally the District Commander of 
the District in which the violation is believed to have occurred, or the 
District in which the reporting unit or agency is found. The report is 
reviewed to determine if there is sufficient evidence to establish a 
prima facie case. If there is insufficient evidence, the case is either 
returned for further investigation or closed if further action is 
unwarranted. The case is closed in situations in which the investigation 
has established that a violation did not occur, the violator is unknown, 
or there is little likelihood of discovering additional relevant facts. 
If it is determined that a prima facie case does exist, a case file is 
prepared and forwarded to the Hearing Officer, with a recommended 
action. A record of any prior violations by the same person or entity, 
is forwarded with the case file.

been completed, an issuing officer may issue a Notice of Violation to 
the party.
    (b) The Notice of Violation will contain the following information:
    (1) The alleged violation and the applicable law or regulations 
violated;
    (2) The amount of the maximum penalty that may be assessed for each 
violation;
    (3) The amount of proposed penalty that appears to be appropriate;
    (4) A statement that payment of the proposed penalty within 45 days 
will settle the case;
    (5) The place to which, and the manner in which, payment is to be 
made;
    (6) A statement that the party may decline the Notice of Violation 
and that if the Notice of Violation is declined, the party has the right 
to a hearing prior to a final assessment of a penalty by a Hearing 
Officer.
    (c) The Notice of Violation may be hand delivered to the party or an 
employee of the party, or may be mailed to the business address of the 
party.
    (d) If a party declines a Notice of Violation or takes no action on 
the Notice of Violation within 45 days, the case file will be sent to 
the District Commander for processing under the procedures described in 
Sec. 1.07-10(b).

<R05>
Sec. 1.07-15  Hearing Officer.

    (a) The Hearing Officer has no other responsibility, direct or 
supervisory, for the investigation of cases referred for the assessment 
of civil penalties. The hearing officer may take action on a case 
referred by any District Commander.
    (b) The Hearing Officer decides each case on the basis of the 
evidence before him, and must have no prior connection with the case. 
The Hearing Officer is solely responsible for the decision in each case 
referred to him.
    (c) The Hearing Officer is authorized to administer oaths and issue 
subpenas necessary to the conduct of a hearing, to the extent provided 
by law.

[CGD 78-82, 43 FR 54186, Nov. 20, 1978, as amended by CGD 87-008a, 52 FR 
17554, May 11, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 1.07-20  Initiation of action.

    (a) When a case is received for action, the Hearing Officer makes a 
preliminary examination of the material submitted. If, on the basis of 
the preliminary examination, the Hearing Officer

[[Page 17]]

determines that there is insufficient evidence to proceed, or that there 
is any other reason which would make penalty action inappropriate, the 
Hearing Officer returns the case to the District Commander with a 
written statement of the reason. The District Commander may close the 
case or cause a further investigation of the alleged violation to be 
made with a view toward resubmittal of the case to the Hearing Officer.
    (b) If on the basis of the preliminary examination of the case file, 
the Hearing Officer determines that a violation appears to have been 
committed, the Hearing Officer notifies the party in writing of:
    (1) The alleged violation and the applicable law or regulations;
    (2) The amount of the maximum penalty that may be assessed for each 
violation;
    (3) The general nature of the procedure for assessing and collecting 
the penalty;
    (4) The amount of penalty that appears to be appropriate, based on 
the material then available to the Hearing Officer;
    (5) The right to examine all materials in the case file and have a 
copy of all written documents provided upon request; and,
    (6) The fact that the party may demand a hearing prior to any actual 
assessment of a penalty.
    (c) If at any time it appears that the addition of another party to 
the proceedings is necessary or desirable, the Hearing Officer provides 
the additional party with notice as described above.


<R05>
Sec. 1.07-25  Preliminary matters.

    (a) Within 30 days after receipt of notice of the initiation of the 
action, as described above, the party, or counsel for the party, may 
request a hearing, provide any written evidence and arguments in lieu of 
a hearing, or pay the amount specified in the notice as being 
appropriate. A hearing must be requested in writing; the request must 
specify the issues which are in dispute. Failure to specify a 
nonjurisdictional issue will preclude its consideration.
    (b) The right to a hearing is waived if the party does not submit 
the request to the Hearing Officer within 30 days after receiving notice 
of the alleged violation. At the discretion of the Hearing Officer, a 
hearing may be granted if the party submits a late request.
    (c) The Hearing Officer must promptly schedule all hearings which 
are requested. The Hearing Officer shall grant any delays or 
continuances which may be necessary or desirable in the interest of 
fairly resolving the case.
    (d) A party who has requested a hearing may amend the specification 
of the issues in dispute at any time up to 10 days before the scheduled 
date of the hearing. Issues raised later than 10 days before the 
scheduled hearing may be presented only at the discretion of the Hearing 
Officer.

<R05>
Sec. 1.07-30  Disclosure of evidence.

    The alleged violator may, upon request, receive a free copy of all 
the written evidence in the case file, except material that would 
disclose or lead to the disclosure of the identity of a confidential 
informant. Other evidence or material, such as blueprints, sound or 
video tapes, oil samples, and photographs may be examined in the Hearing 
Officer's offices. The Hearing Officer may provide for examination or 
testing of evidence at other locations if there are adequate safeguards 
to prevent loss or tampering.


<R05>
Sec. 1.07-35  Request for confidential treatment.

    (a) In addition to information treated as confidential under 
Sec. 1.07-30, a request for confidential treatment of a document or 
portion thereof may be made by the person supplying the information on 
the basis that the information is:
    (1) Confidential financial information, trade secrets, or other 
material exempt from disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act (5 
U.S.C. 552);
    (2) Required to be held in confidence by 18 U.S.C. 1905; or
    (3) Otherwise exempt by law from disclosure.
    (b) The person desiring confidential treatment must submit the 
request to

[[Page 18]]

the Hearing Officer in writing and state the reasons justifying 
nondisclosure. Failure to make a timely request may result in a document 
being considered as nonconfidential and subject to release.
    (c) Confidential material is not considered by the Hearing Officer 
in reaching a decision unless:
    (1) It has been furnished by a party, or
    (2) It has been furnished pursuant to a subpena.


<R05>
Sec. 1.07-40  Counsel.

    A party has the right to be represented at all stages of the 
proceeding by counsel. After receiving notification that a party is 
represented by counsel, the Hearing Officer directs all further 
communications to that counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 1.07-45  Location of hearings and change of venue.

    (a) The hearing is normally held at the office of the Hearing 
Officer.
    (b) The Hearing Officer may transfer a case to another Hearing 
Officer on request or on the Hearing Officer's own motion.
    (c) A request for change of location of a hearing or transfer to 
another Hearing Officer must be in writing and state the reasons why the 
requested action is necessary or desirable. Action on the request is at 
the discretion of the Hearing Officer.

[CGD 87-008a, 52 FR 17554, May 11, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 1.07-50  Witnesses.

    A party may present the testimony of any witness either through a 
personal appearance or through a written statement. The party may 
request the assistance of the Hearing Officer in obtaining the personal 
appearance of a witness. The request must be in writing and state the 
reasons why a written statement would be inadequate, the issue or issues 
to which the testimony would be relevant, and the substance of the 
expected testimony. If the Hearing Officer determines that the personal 
appearance of the witness may materially aid in the decision on the 
case, the Hearing Officer seeks to obtain the witness' appearance. 
Because many statutes prescribing civil penalties do not provide subpena 
power, there may be cases where a witness cannot be required to attend. 
In such a case, the Hearing Officer may move the hearing to the witness' 
location, accept a written statement, or accept a stipulation in lieu of 
testimony. If none of these procedures is practical, the Hearing Officer 
shall proceed on the basis of the evidence before him.


<R05>
Sec. 1.07-55  Hearing procedures.

    (a) The Hearing Officer must conduct a fair and impartial proceeding 
in which the party is given a full opportunity to be heard. At the 
outset of the hearing, the Hearing Officer insures that the party is 
aware of the nature of the proceeding and of the alleged violation, and 
of the provisions of the law or regulation allegedly violated.
    (b) The material in the case file pertinent to the issues to be 
determined by the Hearing Officer is presented. The party has the right 
to examine, and to respond to or rebut, this material. The party may 
offer any facts, statements, explanations, documents, sworn or unsworn 
testimony, or other exculpatory items which bear on appropriate issues, 
or which may be relevant to the size of an appropriate penalty. The 
Hearing Officer may require the authentication of any written exhibit or 
statement.
    (c) At the close of the party's presentation of evidence, the 
Hearing Officer may allow the introduction of rebuttal evidence. The 
Hearing Officer may allow the party to respond to any such evidence 
submitted.
    (d) In receiving evidence, the Hearing Officer is not bound by 
strict rules of evidence. In evaluating the evidence presented, the 
Hearing Officer must give due consideration to the reliability and 
relevance of each item of evidence.
    (e) The Hearing Officer may take notice of matters which are subject 
to a high degree of indisputability and are commonly known in the 
community or are ascertainable from readily available sources of known 
accuracy. Prior to taking notice of a matter, the Hearing Officer gives 
the party an opportunity to show why notice should not be taken. In any 
case in which notice is taken, the Hearing Officer places a written 
statement of the matters as to

[[Page 19]]

which notice was taken in the record, with the basis for such notice, 
including a statement that the party consented to notice being taken or 
a summary of the party's objections.
    (f) After the evidence in the case has been presented, the party may 
present argument on the issues in the case. The party may also request 
an opportunity to submit a written statement for consideration by the 
Hearing Officer and for further review. The Hearing Officer shall allow 
a reasonable time for submission of the statement and shall specify the 
date by which it must be received. If the statement is not received 
within the time prescribed, or within the limits of any extension of 
time granted by the Hearing Officer, the Hearing Officer renders his 
decision in the case.


<R05>
Sec. 1.07-60  Records.

    (a) A verbatim transcript will not normally be prepared. The Hearing 
Officer prepares notes on the material and points raised by the party, 
in sufficient detail to permit a full and fair review and resolution of 
the case, should it be appealed.
    (b) A party may, at its own expense, cause a verbatim transcript to 
be made. If a verbatim transcript is made, the party shall submit two 
copies to the Hearing Officer not later than the time of filing and 
administrative appeal. The Hearing Officer includes them in the record.


<R05>
Sec. 1.07-65  Hearing Officer's decisions.

    (a) The Hearing Officer issues a written decision. Any decision to 
assess a penalty is based upon substantial evidence in the record. If 
the Hearing Officer finds that there is not substantial evidence in the 
record establishing the alleged violation or some other violation of 
which the party had full and fair notice, the Hearing Officer shall 
dismiss the case and remand it to the District Commander. A dismissal is 
without prejudice to the District Commander's right to refile the case 
and have it reheard if additional evidence is obtained. A dismissal 
following a rehearing is final and with prejudice.
    (b) If the Hearing Officer assesses a penalty, the Hearing Officer's 
decision contains a statement advising the party of the right to an 
administrative appeal. The party is advised that failure to submit an 
appeal within the prescribed time will bar its consideration and that 
failure to appeal on the basis of a particular issue will constitute a 
waiver of that issue in any subsequent proceeding.

[CGD 78-82, 43 FR 54186, Nov. 20, 1978, as amended by CGD 85-001A, 51 FR 
19329, May 29, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 1.07-70  Right to appeal.

    (a) Any appeal from the decision of the Hearing Officer must be 
submitted by a party within 30 days from the date of receipt of the 
decision. The appeal and any supporting brief must be submitted to the 
Hearing Officer. The only issues which will be considered on appeal are 
those issues specified in the appeal which were properly raised before 
the Hearing Officer and jurisdictional questions.
    (b) The failure to file an appeal within the prescribed time limit 
results in the action of the Hearing Officer becoming the final agency 
action in the case.


<R05>
Sec. 1.07-75  Action on appeals.

    (a) Upon receipt, the Hearing Officer provides a copy of the appeal 
and any supporting brief to the District Commander who referred the 
case. Any comments which the District Commander desires to submit must 
be received by the Hearing Officer within 30 days. The Hearing Officer 
includes the District Commander's comments, or not later than 30 days 
after receipt of the appeal if no comments are submitted by the District 
Commander, the Hearing Officer forwards all materials in the case to the 
Commandant.
    (b) The Commandant issues a written decision in each case and 
furnishes copies to the party, the District Commander, and the Hearing 
Officer, The Commandant may affirm, reverse, or modify the decision, or 
remand the case for new or additional proceedings. In the absence of a 
remand, the decision of the Commandant on appeal shall be final. In 
addition to the actions which may be taken by the Commandant on appeal, 
the Commandant may also remit, mitigate or suspend the assessment in 
whole or in part.

[[Page 20]]

Upon the taking of remission, mitigation, or suspension action, the 
Commandant will inform the party of the action and any conditions placed 
on the action.

[CGD 78-82, 43 FR 54186, Nov. 20, 1978, as amended by CGD 87-008a, 52 FR

<R05>
Sec. 1.07-80  Reopening of hearings.

    (a) At any time prior to final agency action in a civil penalty 
case, a party may petition to reopen the hearing on the basis of newly 
discovered evidence.
    (b) Petitions to reopen must be in writing describing the newly 
found evidence and must state why the evidence would probably produce a 
different result favorable to the petitioner, whether the evidence was 
known to the petitioner at the time of the hearing and, if not, why the 
newly found evidence could not have been discovered in the exercise of 
due diligence. The party must submit the petition to the Hearing 
Officer.
    (c) The District Commander may file comments in opposition to the 
petition. If comments are filed, a copy is provided the party.
    (d) A petition to reopen is considered by the Hearing Officer unless 
an appeal has been filed, in which case the petition is considered by 
the Commandant.
    (e) The decision on the petition is decided on the basis of the 
record, the petition, and the comments in opposition, if any. The 
petition is granted only when newly found evidence is described which 
has a direct and material bearing on the issues and when a valid 
explanation is provided as to why the evidence was not and could not 
have been, in the exercise of due diligence, produced at the hearing. 
The decision is rendered in writing.

<R05>
Sec. 1.26-15  Sales of nonexcess personal property and services.

    (a) Authority. The provisions of Title 14, U.S. Code, section 
641(b), authorizes the Coast Guard to sell apparatus or equipment 
manufactured by or in use in the Coast Guard, which is not readily 
procurable in the open market. The provisions of Title 14, U.S. Code, 
section 654 (Pub. L. 86-159 approved Aug. 14, 1959), authorize the Coast 
Guard to sell supplies and furnish services to public and commercial 
vessels, and other watercraft. 49 U.S.C. 44502(d) authorizes the Coast 
Guard to provide for assistance, the sale of fuel, oil, equipment, and 
supplies, to an aircraft when necessary to allow the aircraft to 
continue to the nearest private airport.
    (b) Charges established by District Commander. The charges for 
supplies and services which may be normally expected to be furnished to 
persons, corporations, companies, vessels, and other watercraft, and 
non-Federal aircraft will vary between various geographical regions 
depending on local circumstances. The District Commander is hereby 
delegated authority to prescribe and he shall establish, in advance 
wherever practicable, the charges to be imposed and collected in various 
areas under his jurisdiction, which will be in accordance with the 
applicable general minimum terms and conditions in the laws and this 
section. In those cases where the charges have not been established in 
advance, the matter shall be priced on an individual basis, taking into 
consideration the facts and circumstances regarding the situation. The 
list(s) of charges established by the District Commander shall be 
available for reading and copying at the office of the issuing District 
Commander, which list(s) will be up-dated and reissued when necessary.
    (c) Sales to vessels and other watercraft. (1) The charges imposed 
for services are intended to permit repayment of costs involved in those 
instances where supplies and services are furnished to meet the 
necessities of the circumstances, and such vessels or watercraft are not 
within the scope of those distress services performed by the Coast 
Guard.
    (2) Charges for sales of supplies and/or furnishing of services are 
considered

[[Page 26]]

appropriate when the furnishing of food, fuel, general stores, or 
repairs to the vessel or its equipage are primarily for the convenience 
of the owner, master, or crew, and furnished at his or their request. It 
is not intended and the Coast Guard does not procure and stock equipment 
and supplies except as provided for in current instructions issued by 
competent authority.
    (3) Supplies provided and services performed will be of a limited 
nature consistent with the situation and within the capabilities of the 
Coast Guard unit concerned; provided this will not be in competition 
with commercial enterprise when such facilities are available and deemed 
adequate. It is not intended to permit the operators of vessels or 
watercraft to take advantage of the Government by demanding free 
supplies or services. Determination as to whether charges will be made 
is dependent upon the circumstances involved in each instance. The 
responsibility to make this determination rests with the District 
Commander who may delegate it to his subordinates.
    (4) The minimum charge for any supplies or services furnished to a 
vessel or other watercraft shall be $10. The prices for fuels and 
materials which may be sold will be at Coast Guard cost plus 20 percent 
or, if readily determinable, at the commercial price in the immediate 
operating area, whichever is higher. The charges for services furnished 
a vessel or watercraft will be an average cost equal to the full price, 
plus taxes, that a boat owner would pay a local commercial concern for 
such services.
    (5) The sales of supplies and services will be documented and will 
set forth the name, type, and identifying number of the vessel or 
watercraft receiving supplies or services; name and address of vessel's 
owner; and conditions under which it was determined to make a sale to

at the time supplies and services are furnished.
    (d) Sales of equipment not readily procurable on the open market. 
Charges imposed for sales of apparatus and equipment manufactured by or

    (4) The approved sales will be at prices determined by the 
Commandant (FS), which will include an overhead charge not to exceed 25 
percent of acquisition cost.
    (e) Sales to and storage of non-Federal aircraft. (1) Activities

                          Subpart 2.01--Purpose


<R05>
Sec. 2.01-1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to inform the public of the definitions 
which the Coast Guard uses to examine waters to determine whether the 
Coast Guard has jurisdiction on those waters under particular U.S. laws.


<R04>
            Subpart 2.05--Definitions of Jurisdictional Terms


<R05>
Sec. 2.05-1  High seas.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, 
high seas means all waters which are neither territorial seas nor 
internal waters of the United States or of any foreign country.<SUP>1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1</SUP>  It should be noted that under 14 U.S.C. 89 the Coast Guard 
is authorized to enforce the laws of the United States upon the ``high 
seas'' and waters over which the United States has jurisdiction. Certain 
of the criminal laws of the United States are based on its special 
maritime and territorial jurisdiction, one of whose components is the 
``high seas'', as defined in paragraph (b). However, this definition of 
``high seas'' does not apply to the use of ``high seas'' found in 14 
U.S.C. 89, to which the definition in paragraph (a) applies. A clear 
distinction should be maintained between the Coast Guard's authority 
under 14 U.S.C. 89 and the jurisdictional base of the criminal laws 
which apply to the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction. For 
example, while assault (18 U.S.C. 113) committed seaward of the 
territorial sea could be committed on the ``high seas'' for both 
purposes, an assault committed within the territorial sea could be 
committed on the ``high seas'' to bring it within the special maritime 
and territorial jurisdiction and at the same time be committed on waters 
over which the United States has jurisdiction (not the ``high seas'') 
for purposes of the Coast Guard's authority to undertake enforcement 
action.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) High seas, as used in 18 U.S.C. 7(1), means the Great Lakes and 
waters seaward of the low water line along the coast, except waters 
within harbors or narrow coastal indentations enclosed by 
promontories.<SUP>1
    </SUP>(c) High seas, as used in section 2 of the Act of February 19, 
1895, as amended, 33 U.S.C. 151, and all laws referring thereto, means 
the waters seaward of the lines described in 46 CFR 7.

<R05>
Sec. 2.05-5  Territorial seas.

    (a) With respect to the United States, territorial seas means the 
waters within the belt, 3 nautical miles wide, that is adjacent to its 
coast and seaward of the territorial sea baseline.
    (b) With respect to any foreign country, territorial seas means the 
waters within the belt that is adjacent to its coast and whose breadth 
and baseline are recognized by the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 2.05-10  Territorial sea baseline.

    Territorial Sea Baseline means the delimitation of the shoreward 
extent of the territorial seas of the United States drawn in accordance 
with principles, as recognized by the United States, of the Convention 
on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, 15 U.S.T. 1606. Charts 
depicting the territorial sea baseline are available for examination in 
accordance with Sec. 1.10-5(b) of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 2.05-15  Contiguous zone.

    Contiguous zone means the belt of high seas, 9 nautical miles wide, 
that is adjacent to and seaward of the territorial seas of the United 
States and that was declared to exist in Department of State Public 
Notice 358 of June 1, 1972, 37 FR 11906.


<R05>
Sec. 2.05-20  Internal waters and inland waters.

    (a) Internal waters and, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, inland waters mean:
    (1) With respect to the United States, the waters shoreward of the 
territorial sea baseline.
    (2) With respect to any foreign country, the waters shoreward of the 
baseline of its territorial sea, as recognized by the United States.
    (b) Inland waters, as used in 33 U.S.C. Chapter 3, means the waters 
shoreward of the lines described in part 80 of this chapter, except the 
Great Lakes and their connecting and tributary waters as far east as 
Montreal, the waters of

[[Page 29]]

the Mississippi River between its source and the Huey P. Long Bridge and 
all of its tributaries emptying thereinto and their tributaries, that 
part of the Atchafalaya River above its junction with the Plaquemine-
Morgan City alternate waterway, and the Red River of the North.

Guard, the terms ``State'' and ``United States'' are defined to include 
some or all of the territories and possessions of the United States. The 
definitions in Secs. 2.05-25 and 2.05-30 should be considered as 
supplementary to these statutory definitions and not as interpretive of 
them.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, navigable

    (1) Territorial seas of the United States;
    (2) Internal waters of the United States that are subject to tidal 
influence; and
    (3) Internal waters of the United States not subject to tidal 
influence that:
    (i) Are or have been used, or are or have been susceptible for use, 
by themselves or in connection with other waters, as highways for 
substantial interstate or foreign commerce, notwithstanding natural or 
man-made obstructions that require portage, or
    (ii) A governmental or non-governmental body, having expertise in 
waterway improvement, determines to be capable of improvement at a 
reasonable cost (a favorable balance between cost and need) to provide, 
by themselves or in connection with other waters, highways for 
substantial interstate or foreign commerce.
    (b) Navigable waters of the United States and navigable waters, as 
used in sections 311 and 312 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 
as amended, 33 U.S.C. 1321 and 1322, mean:
    (1) Navigable waters of the United States as defined in paragraph 
(a) of this section and all waters within the United States tributary 
thereto; and
    (2) Other waters over which the Federal Government may exercise 
Constitutional authority.


<R05>
Sec. 2.05-27  Waters subject to tidal influence; waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tide; mean high water.

    Waters subject to tidal influence and waters subject to the ebb and 
flow of the tide are interpreted as waters below mean high water. ``Mean 
high water'' is the average of the height of the diurnal high water at a 
particular location measured over a lunar cycle period of 19 years. 
These terms do not include waters above mean high water caused by flood 
flows, storms, high winds, seismic waves, or other non-lunar phenomena.

<R05>
Sec. 3.01-1  General description.

    (a) The structure of the Coast Guard's general organization for the 
performance of its assigned functions and duties consists of the 
Commandant, assisted by the Headquarters staff, two Area Offices to act 
as intermediate echelons of operational command, and District Offices to 
provide regional direction and coordination. The District Offices 
operate within defined geographical areas of the United States, its 
territories, and possessions, including portions of the high seas 
adjacent thereto. The description of the districts is established by the 
Commandant under the authority delegated by 49 CFR 1.45 and 1.46.
    (b) The two Coast Guard Areas are the Atlantic Area (see Sec. 3.04-
1) and the Pacific Area (see Sec. 3.04-3). The Coast Guard Area 
Commander is in command of a Coast Guard Area; the offices are referred 
to as a Coast Guard Area Office. The office of the Commander, Atlantic 
Area, is located in the Fifth Coast Guard District and the Commander, 
Atlantic Area, also serves as the Fifth District Commander. The office 
of the Commander, Pacific Area, is located in the Eleventh Coast Guard 
District and the Commander, Pacific Area, also serves as the Eleventh 
District Commander. Area Commanders have the responsibility of 
determining when operational matters require the coordination of forces 
and facilities of more than one district.
    (c) The Coast Guard District Commander is in command of a Coast 
Guard District and his office may be referred to as a Coast Guard 
District Office. (See Sec. 1.01-1 of this subchapter.)

[[Page 32]]

    (d) An Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, is in command of a 
Marine Inspection Zone and his office may be referred to as a Coast 
Guard Marine Inspection Office. (See Sec. 1.01-20 of this subchapter.)
    (e) The Captain of the Port is in command of a Captain of the Port 
Area and his office may be referred to as a Captain of the Port Office. 
(See Sec. 1.01-30 of this subchapter.)
    (f) Each Captain of the Port Area and each Marine Inspection Zone 
described in this part also includes the United States territorial seas 
adjacent to the described Area or Zone for the purpose of enforcing or 
acting pursuant to a statute effective in the United States territorial 
seas. Each Captain of the Port Area and each Marine Inspection Zone 
described in this part also includes the Contiguous Zone adjacent to the 
Area or Zone for the purpose of enforcing or acting pursuant to a 
statute effective in the Contiguous Zone. (See Secs. 2.05-5 and 2.05-
15.) Each Captain of the Port Zone and each Marine Inspection Zone 
described in this part also includes the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) 
adjacent to the area for the purpose of enforcing or acting pursuant to 
a statute effective in the EEZ.
    (g) Geographic coordinates expressed in terms of latitude or 
longitude, or both, are not intended for plotting on maps or charts 
whose referenced horizontal datum is the North American Datum of 1983 
(NAD 83), unless such geographic coordinates are expressly labeled NAD 
83. Geographic coordinates without the NAD 83 reference may be plotted 
on maps or charts referenced to NAD 83 only after application of the 
appropriate corrections that are published on the particular map or 
chart being used.

 Subpart 13.01--Gold and Silver Lifesaving Medals, Bars, and Miniatures


<R05>
Sec. 13.01-1  General.

    Lifesaving Medals of gold and silver, designated as the Gold 
Lifesaving Medal and the Silver Lifesaving Medal, respectively, may be 
awarded by the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, hereinafter called the 
Commandant, under 14 U.S.C. 500 and the regulations in this subpart to 
persons rescuing or endeavoring to rescue any other person from 
drowning, shipwreck or other peril of the water.


<R05>
Sec. 13.01-5  Gold and Silver Lifesaving Medals.

    Lifesaving Medals may be awarded to any person who rescues or 
endeavors to rescue any other person from drowning, shipwreck or other 
peril of the water. In order for a person to be eligible for a 
Lifesaving Medal the rescue or attempted rescue must take place in 
waters within the United States or subject to the jurisdiction thereof, 
or if the rescue or attempted rescue takes place outside such waters, 
one or the other of the parties must be a citizen of the United States 
or from a vessel or aircraft owned or operated by citizens of the United 
States. If such rescue or attempted rescue is made at the risk of one's 
own life and evidences extreme and heroic daring, the medal shall be of 
gold. If such rescue or attempted rescue is not sufficiently 
distinguished to deserve the medal of gold but evidences the exercise of 
such signal exertion as to merit recognition, the medal shall be of 
silver. Lifesaving Medals may be awarded posthumously.


<R05>
Sec. 13.01-10  Gold and silver bars.

    No person shall receive more than one Gold Lifesaving Medal and one 
Silver Lifesaving Medal; but any person who has received or may 
hereafter receive a Gold or Silver Lifesaving Medal and who again 
performs an act which would entitle him to receive another medal of the 
same class, may be awarded, in lieu of a second medal of the same class, 
a gold or silver bar, as the case may be, to be worn with the medal 
already bestowed, and for every such additional act, an additional bar 
may be awarded. Gold and silver bars may be awarded posthumously.


<R05>
Sec. 13.01-15  Applications and recommendations.

    (a) All administrative details pertaining to the award of Lifesaving 
Medals are under the jurisdiction of the Commandant. Applications and 
recommendations for the award of a Lifesaving Medal may be filed by or 
in behalf of the person making or attempting a rescue under 
circumstances contemplated by the regulations in this subpart. 
Applications or recommendations for award of medals or requests for 
information pertaining thereto should be addressed to the Commander of 
the Coast Guard District, hereinafter called the District Commander, 
where the incident took place. (See part 3 of this subchapter for 
descriptions of Coast Guard Districts.) If the District is unknown, or 
if the incident took place outside any such district, applications and 
recommendations should be addressed to the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, 
Washington, D.C. 20593.
    (b) Completed applications must include:
    (1) Satisfactory evidence of the services performed, in the form of 
affidavits, made by eyewitnesses of good repute and standing testifying 
of their own knowledge. The opinion of witnesses that the person for 
whom an award is sought imperiled his or her own life or made signal 
exertions is not sufficient but the affidavits must set forth in detail 
all facts and occurrences tending to show clearly in what manner and to 
what extent life was risked or signal exertions made so that the

[[Page 62]]

Commandant may judge for himself as to the degree of merit involved.
    (2) The precise locality of the rescue or attempted rescue, whether 
from waters within the United States or subject to the jurisdiction 
thereof, or if the rescue or attempted rescue is outside such waters, 
whether one or the other of the parties is a citizen of the United 
States, or from a vessel or aircraft owned or operated by citizens of 
the United States, shall be stated. The date, time of day, nature of the 
weather, condition of the water, the names of all persons present when 
practicable, the names of all persons rendering assistance, and all 
pertinent circumstances and data, showing the precise nature and degree 
of risk involved, should be stated.
    (c) Recommendations must include:
    (1) As much of the information indicated in paragraphs (b) (1) and 
(2) of this section which is available to the person making the 
recommendation. Upon receipt the Commandant or the cognizant District 
Commander shall cause such recommendation to be referred to an 
investigating officer who shall cause to be developed such additional 
information and evidence as is deemed necessary to either (i) terminate 
the investigation as containing insufficient justification to continue 
further, or (ii) to complete the application for submission to the 
Commandant for his final determination.
    (d) Either the Commandant or the District Commander may, without any 
application or recommendation, of his own motion, order an informal 
investigation into such an incident under Chapter II, of the Coast Guard 
Supplement to the Manual for Courts-Martial (CG-241).
    (e) Affidavits required by this subpart shall be made before an 
officer duly authorized to administer oaths and if taken before an 
officer without an official seal, his official character must be 
certified by the proper officer of a court of record, under the seal 
thereof, unless the oath be taken before an officer of the Armed Forces 
authorized to administer oaths under the provisions of Article 136, UCMJ 
(10 U.S.C. 936).
    (f) Cognizant District Commanders shall act upon all applications 
and recommendations submitted to them from whatever source and shall:
    (1) Forward completed applications with his recommendations to the 
Commandant for his consideration and determination; or,
    (2) Inform the applicant or the person submitting the recommendation 
that he considers such application or recommendation incomplete together 
with the reasons therefor and that a period of 90 days will be allowed 
for additional evidence to be provided upon the expiration of which he 
will file the application or recommendation without further action.
    (g) Whenever the cognizant District Commander shall deem such action 
necessary, he may require that the aforementioned affidavits shall be 
accompanied by a certificate showing the affiants to be credible 
persons, certified by some U.S. Officer, such as a judge or clerk of a 
U.S. Court, district attorney, collector of customs, postmaster, or 
officer of the Armed Forces. If the affiant is a citizen or resident of 
a foreign country and if the affidavit is executed in such foreign 
country, the credibility certificate may be executed by an officer of 
such foreign country, who occupies an official position similar to the 
aforementioned U.S. officers.
    (h) The decision of the Commandant on all applications, 
recommendations, and investigations for the Gold or Silver Lifesaving 
Medals shall be final.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 19.01  Procedures for effecting individual waivers of navigation and vessel inspection laws and regulations.

    (a) It is hereby found necessary in the interest of national defense 
to waive compliance with the navigation and vessel inspection laws 
administered by the Coast Guard, as well as the regulations issued 
thereunder and contained in 46 CFR Chapter I or in this chapter, to the 
extent and in the manner and upon the terms and conditions as set forth 
in this section.
    (b) An application requesting that a waiver be made effective with 
respect to a particular vessel may be made by any authorized 
representative of an agency of the United States Government or any other 
interested person (including the master, agent, or owner of the vessel 
involved). Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the 
application shall be in writing. The application shall be delivered to 
the Coast Guard District Commander or to his designated representative 
at the port or place where the vessel is located. In the case of a 
vessel in any port or place of the Canal Zone or in any foreign port or 
place, the application shall be made to the designated representative of 
the Commandant at such port or place, or if the Coast Guard has not 
established facilities in such port or place, to the nearest designated 
representative of the Commandant at a port or place where such 
facilities have been established. Every application shall contain a 
statement of the particular provisions of law with respect to which 
waiver of compliance is requested, a certification that the waiver of 
compliance with such laws with respect to the vessel involved is 
necessary in the interest of national defense and, an outline of the 
facts upon which such certification is based. The Coast Guard District 
Commander (or his designated representative or the designated 
representative of the Commandant, as the case may be) shall promptly 
examine every application for the purpose of determining whether the 
necessity for prompt action is such as to require that the waiver be 
made effective by him without reference to the Commandant. In any case 
in which it appears to the Coast Guard officer

[[Page 66]]

concerned that reference of the application to the Commandant for action 
would not delay the sailing of the vessel or otherwise be contrary to 
the interest of national defense, the application shall be so referred. 
In all other cases such Coast Guard officer shall give immediate 
consideration to the application and if he reaches the conclusion that 
the urgency of the situation outweighs the marine hazard involved, then 
such waiver shall be made effective in regard to such vessel to the 
extent and under the circumstances specified by him.
    (c) The Coast Guard officer making such a waiver effective pursuant 
to paragraph (b) of this section shall immediately prepare, in 
triplicate, an order setting forth the name of the vessel involved, the 
laws (also regulations, if any) with respect to which the waiver is 
effective, the extent to which compliance with such laws (also 
regulations, if any) is waived, and the period for which the waiver 
shall be effective. If practicable, one copy of this order shall be 
delivered to the master of the vessel involved before such vessel sails. 
In any case where the order is not delivered to the master, it shall be 
delivered to the owner, operator, or agent of the vessel without delay. 
One copy of the order shall be transmitted to the Commandant and the 
remaining copy kept on file.
    (d) In any case of extreme urgency the application for a waiver may 
be made orally and if the Coast Guard District Commander (or his 
designated representative or the designated representative of the 
Commandant, as the case may be) reaches the conclusion referred to in 
paragraph (b) of this section, the waiver shall be made effective 
without further delay, subject to the condition that the application be 
reduced to writing and delivered within such period after the date of 
the oral request as the Coast Guard officer making the waiver effective 
shall specify in the order.
    (e) No penalty shall be imposed because of failure to comply with 
any provision of law (or regulation, if any), the waiver of which has 
been made effective pursuant to the requirements in this section.

Defense, Installations and Logistics, dated May 23, 1964, made under the 
provisions of section 1 of Pub. L. 891, 81st Congress, approved December 
27, 1950 (64 Stat. 1120; 46 U.S.C., note preceding section 1), and their 
findings that a waiver is necessary in the interest of national defense, 
compliance with the provisions of the navigation and vessel inspection 
laws administered by the United States Coast Guard, as well as the 
regulations issued thereunder and contained in 33 CFR Chapter I, or in 
this chapter, is hereby waived to the extent and upon the terms and 
conditions as set forth in this section, in order to permit vessels 
operated by or chartered to the Military Sea Transportation Service to 
carry out their assigned missions.
    (b) An application requesting that this waiver be made effective 
with respect to a particular vessel may be made by the Commander, 
Military Sea Transportation Service, or any one of his duly designated 
representatives. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, 
the application shall be in writing. The application shall be delivered

representative at the port or place where the vessel is located. In the 
case of a vessel

[[Page 67]]

in any foreign port or place, the application shall be made to the 
designated representative of the Commandant at such port or place, or if 
the Coast Guard has not established facilities in such port or place, to 
the nearest designated representative of the Commandant at a port or 
place where such facilities have been established, or to the Commandant 
(G-MOC), U.S. Coast Guard, Washington, DC 20593-0001. Every application 
shall:
    (1) Describe the laws and/or regulations by appropriate references 
and/or subjects with respect to which the waiver of compliance is 
desired;
    (2) Contain a certification that the waiver of compliance with such 
laws and/or regulations with respect to the vessel involved is necessary 
in the interest of national defense and is necessary for the Military 
Sea Transportation Service to carry out an assigned mission;
    (3) The name and official number of the vessel involved (including 
the names of master, agent, and owner of the vessel involved); and
    (4) For how long the waiver is needed.
    (c) The Coast Guard officer making the waiver in paragraph (a) of 
this section effective for a particular vessel shall immediately 
prepare, in quadruplicate, an order setting forth:
    (1) The name and official number of the vessel involved;
    (2) The laws and/or regulations with respect to which the waiver is 
effective;
    (3) The extent to which compliance with such laws and/or regulations 
is waived; and
    (4) The period for which the waiver shall be effective.
    (d) If practicable, one copy of this waiver order shall be delivered 
to the master of the vessel involved before such vessel sails. In any 
case where the waiver order is not delivered to the master, it shall be 
delivered to the owner, operator, or agent of the vessel without delay. 
One copy of the waiver order shall be delivered to the Commander, 
Military Sea Transportation Service, or his duly designated 
representative, who submitted the application. One copy of the waiver 
order shall be transmitted to the Commandant (G-MOC) and the remaining 
copy kept on file.
    (e) In any case of extreme urgency, the application for a waiver 
order may be made orally and if the Coast Guard District Commander (or 
his designated representative, or the designated representative of the 
Commandant, or the Commandant, as the case may be), determines that the 
conditions in this section have been met, the waiver order shall be made 
effective without further delay, subject to the condition that the 
application be reduced to writing and delivered within such period after 
the date of the oral request as the Coast Guard officer making the

Sec. 19.15  Permits for commercial vessels handling explosives at military installations.

    Pursuant to the request of the Secretary of Defense in a letter 
dated October 19, 1955, made under the provisions of section 1 of the 
act of December 27, 1950 (64 Stat. 1120; 46 U.S.C., note prec. 1), I 
hereby waive in the interest of national defense compliance with the 
provisions of R.S. 4472, as amended (46 U.S.C. 170), and the regulations 
promulgated thereunder in part 146 of this chapter to the extent that no 
quantitative restrictions, based on considerations of isolation and 
remoteness, shall be required by the Coast Guard for commercial vessels 
loading or unloading explosives at the Department of Defense waterfront 
installations. This waiver shall not relieve a commercial vessel loading 
or unloading explosives at the Department of Defense waterfront 
installations from the requirement of securing a permit from the Coast 
Guard for such operations with respect to quantitative or other 
restrictions imposed by the Coast Guard on the basis of each vessel's 
ability to meet prescribed stowage and handling requirements.

Liability Act (42 U.S.C. 9609(b)), by the filing of--

a deposition may be offered into evidence by the party taking it against 
any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition 
or who had notice of the deposition.
    (i) The party requesting the deposition shall make appropriate 
arrangements for necessary facilities and personnel.
    (j) During the taking of a deposition, a party or the witness may 
request suspension of the deposition on the grounds of bad faith in the 
conduct of

[[Page 80]]

the examination, oppression of the witness or party, or improper 
questioning or conduct. Upon request for suspension, the deposition will 
be adjourned. The objecting party or witness must immediately move the 
ALJ for a ruling on the objection(s). The ALJ may then limit the scope 
or manner of the taking of the deposition.
    (k) When a deposition is taken in a foreign country, it may be taken 
before a person having power to administer oaths in that location, or 
before a secretary of an embassy or legation, consul general, consul, 
vice consul or consular agent of the United States, or before such other 
person or officer as may be agreed upon by the parties by written 
stipulation filed with the ALJ.
    (l) Objection to taking a deposition because of the disqualification 
of the officer before whom it is to be taken is waived unless made 
before the taking of the deposition begins, or as soon as the 
disqualification becomes known or could have been discovered with 
reasonable diligence.
    (m) A deposition may be taken by telephone conference call upon such 
terms, conditions, and arrangements as are prescribed in the order of 
the ALJ.
    (n) The testimony at a deposition hearing may be recorded on 
videotape, upon such terms, conditions and arrangements as are 
prescribed in the order of the ALJ, at the expense of the party 
requesting the recording. The video recording may be in conjunction with 
an oral examination by telephone conference held pursuant to paragraph 
(m) of this section. After the deposition has been taken, and copies of 
the video recording are provided to parties requesting them, the person 
recording the deposition shall immediately place the videotape in a 
sealed envelope or a sealed videotape container, attaching to it a 
statement identifying the proceeding and the deponent and certifying as 
to the authenticity of the video recording, and return the videotape by 
accountable means to the ALJ. The deposition becomes a part of the 
record of the proceedings in the same manner as a transcribed 
deposition. The videotape, if admitted into evidence, will be played 
during the hearing and transcribed into the record by the reporter.

Sec. 20.606  Protective orders.

    (a) In considering a motion for an order of discovery--or a motion, 
by a party or other person from whom discovery is sought, to reconsider 
or amend an order of discovery--the ALJ may enter any order that justice 
requires, to protect a person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, 
or undue burden or expense. This order may--
    (1) Confine discovery to specific terms and conditions, such as a 
particular time and place;
    (2) Confine discovery to a method other than that selected by the

specific documents or information under seal for opening at the 
direction of the ALJ.
    (b) When a person from whom discovery is sought seeks a protective 
order, the ALJ may let him or her make all or part of the showing of 
good cause in camera. The ALJ shall record any proceedings in camera. If 
he or she enters a protective order, he or she shall seal any 
proceedings so recorded. These shall be releasable only as required by 
law.
    (c) Upon motion by a person from whom discovery is sought, the ALJ 
may--
    (1) Restrict or defer disclosure by a party either of the name of a 
witness or, if the witness comes from the Coast Guard, of any prior 
statement of the witness; and
    (2) Prescribe other appropriate measures to protect a witness.
    (d) The ALJ will give any party an adequate opportunity to prepare 
for cross-examination or other presentation concerning witnesses and 
statement subject to protective orders.

been adverse to the party.
    (b) Order that, for the purposes of the proceeding, designated facts 
are established.
    (c) Order that the party not introduce into evidence--or otherwise 
rely upon, in support of any claim or defense--the evidence that was 
withheld.

discovery or for any hearing. Any party seeking a subpoena from the ALJ 
shall request its issuance by motion.
    (b) An ALJ may, for good cause shown, apply to the United States 
District Court for the issuance of an order compelling the appearance 
and testimony of a witness or the production of evidence.
    (c) A person serving a subpoena shall prepare a written statement 
setting forth either the date, time, and manner of service or the reason 
for failure of service. He or she shall swear to or affirm the 
statement, attach it to a copy of the subpoena, and return it to the ALJ 
who issued the subpoena.
    (d) Coast Guard investigating officers have separate subpoena power 
in S&R proceedings under 46 CFR 5.301.


<R05>
Sec. 20.609  Motions to quash or modify.

appearance and testimony of a witness or the production of evidence or
    (2) At or before the time specified in the subpoena for compliance, 
whichever is earlier.
    (c) If the subpoena is served at a hearing, the person to whom it is 
directed may, in person at the hearing or in writing within a reasonable 
time fixed by the ALJ, ask the ALJ to quash or modify it.
    (d) The ALJ may quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable 
or requires evidence not relevant to any matter in issue.

of a motion, request, or order bears the burden of proof.


<R05>
Sec. 20.703  Presumptions.

    In each administrative hearing, a presumption--
    (a) Imposes on the party against whom it lies the burden of going 
forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption; but

non-persuasion.


<R05>
Sec. 20.704  Scheduling and notice of hearings.

    (a) With due regard for the convenience of the parties, and of their

<R05>
Sec. 20.705  Failure to appear.

    The ALJ may enter a default under Sec. 20.310 against a respondent 
threatening to fail, or having failed, to appear at a hearing unless,--
    (a) Before the time for the hearing, the respondent shows good cause 
why neither the respondent nor his or her representative can appear; or,
    (b) 30 days or less after an order to show good cause, the 
respondent shows good cause for his or her failure to appear.


<R05>
Sec. 20.706  Witnesses.

    (a) Each witness shall testify under oath or affirmation.
    (b) If a witness fails or refuses to answer any question the ALJ 
finds proper, the failure or refusal constitutes grounds for the ALJ to 
strike all or part of the testimony given by the witness or to take any 
other measure he or she deems appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 20.707  Telephonic testimony.

    (a) The ALJ may order the taking of the testimony of a witness by 
telephonic conference call. A person presenting evidence may by motion 
ask for the taking of testimony by this means. The arrangement of the 
call must let each participant listen to and speak to each other within 
the hearing of the ALJ, who will ensure the full identification of each 
so the reporter can create a proper record.
    (b) The ALJ may issue a subpoena directing a witness to testify by 
telephonic conference call. The subpoena in any such instance issues 
under the procedures in Sec. 20.608.


<R05>

argument so far as he or she deems appropriate.
    (b) Before the ALJ decides the case, and upon terms he or she finds 
reasonable, any party may file a brief, proposed findings of fact and 
conclusions of law, or both. Any party may waive this right. If all 
parties waive it, then the ALJ may issue an oral order at the close of 
the hearing.
    (c) Any oral argument, brief, or proposed findings of fact and 
conclusions of law form part of the record of the proceeding, as 
described in Sec. 20.903.


<R04>
                           Subpart H--Evidence


<R05>
Sec. 20.801  General.

    Any party may present his or her case or defense by oral, 
documentary, or demonstrative evidence; submit rebuttal evidence; and 
conduct any cross-examination that may be necessary for a full and true 
disclosure of the facts.


<R05>
Sec. 20.802  Admissibility of evidence.

    (a) The ALJ may admit any relevant oral, documentary, or 
demonstrative evidence, unless privileged. Relevant evidence is evidence 
tending to make the existence of any material fact more

[[Page 83]]

probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.
    (b) The ALJ may exclude evidence if its probative value is 
substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice, by confusion of the 
issues, or by reasonable concern for undue delay, waste of time, or 
needless presentation of cumulative evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 20.803  Hearsay evidence.

    Hearsay evidence is admissible in proceedings governed by this part. 
The ALJ may consider the fact that evidence is hearsay when determining 
its probative value.


<R05>
Sec. 20.804  Objections and offers of proof.

    (a) Any party objecting to the admission or exclusion of evidence 
shall concisely state the grounds. A ruling on every objection must 
appear in the record. No party may raise an objection to the admission 
or exclusion of evidence on appeal unless he or she raised it before the 
ALJ.
    (b) Whenever evidence is objected to, the party offering it may make 
an offer of proof, which must appear in the record.


<R05>
Sec. 20.805  Proprietary information.

    (a) The ALJ may limit introduction of evidence or issue such 
protective or other orders as in his or her judgment are consistent with 
the object of preventing undue disclosure of proprietary matters, 
including, among others, ones of a commercial nature.
    (b) When the ALJ determines that information in a document 
containing proprietary matters should be made available to another 
party, the ALJ may direct the party possessing the document to prepare a 
non-proprietary summary or extract of it. The summary or extract may be 
admitted as evidence in the record.
    (c) If the ALJ determines that a non-proprietary summary or extract 
is inadequate and that proprietary matters must form part of the record 
to avert prejudice to a party, the ALJ may so advise the parties and 
arrange access to the evidence for a party or representative.


<R05>
Sec. 20.806  Official notice.

    The ALJ may take official notice of such matters as could courts, or 
of other facts within the specialized knowledge of the Coast Guard as an 
expert body. When all or part of a decision rests on the official notice 
of a material fact not appearing in the evidence in the record, the 
decision must state as much; and any party, upon timely request, shall 
receive an opportunity to rebut the fact.


<R05>
Sec. 20.807  Exhibits and documents.

    (a) Each exhibit must be numbered and marked for identification by 
the party offering it. The original of each exhibit so marked, whether 
or not offered or admitted into evidence, must be filed and retained in 
the record of the proceeding, unless the ALJ permits the substitution of 
a copy. The party introducing each exhibit so marked shall supply a copy 
of the exhibit to the ALJ and to every party to the proceeding.
    (b) Unless the ALJ directs otherwise, each party who would offer an 
exhibit upon direct examination shall make it available to every other 
party for inspection 15 days or more before the hearing. The ALJ will 
deem admitted the authenticity of each exhibit submitted before the 
hearing unless a party either files written objection and serves it on 
all parties or shows good cause for failure to do both.
    (c) In class II civil penalty proceedings under 33 U.S.C. 
1321(b)(6), each exhibit introduced by an interested person must be 
marked, and filed and retained in the record of the proceeding, unless 
the ALJ permits the substitution of a copy. The interested person shall 
supply a copy of the exhibit to the ALJ and to every party to the 
proceeding. The requirements of paragraph (b) of this section apply to 
any interested person who would offer an exhibit upon direct 
examination.


<R05>
Sec. 20.808  Written testimony.

    The ALJ may enter into the record the written testimony of a 
witness. The witness shall be, or have been, available for oral cross-
examination. The statement must be sworn to, or affirmed, under penalty 
of perjury.

[[Page 84]]


<R05>
Sec. 20.809  Stipulations.

    Any party or interested person may stipulate, in writing, at any 
stage of the proceeding, or orally at the hearing, to any pertinent fact 
or other matter fairly susceptible of stipulation. A stipulation binds 
all parties to it.


<R04>
                          Subpart I--Decisions


<R05>
Sec. 20.901  Summary decisions.

    (a) Any party may move for a summary decision in all or any part of 
the proceeding on the grounds that there is no genuine issue of material 
fact and that the party is entitled to a decision as a matter of law. 
The party must file the motion no later than 15 days before the date 
fixed for the hearing and may include supporting affidavits with the 
motion. Any other party, 10 days or less after service of a motion for 
summary decision, may serve opposing affidavits or countermove for 
summary decision. The ALJ may set the matter for argument and call for 
the submission of briefs.
    (b) The ALJ may grant the motion if the filed affidavits, the filed 
documents, the material obtained by discovery or otherwise, or matters 
officially noted show that there is no genuine issue of material fact 
and that a party is entitled to a summary decision as a matter of law.
    (c) Each affidavit must set forth such matters as would be 
admissible in evidence and must show affirmatively that the affiant is 
competent to testify to the matters stated in the affidavit. Once a 
party has moved for summary decision and supported his or her motion as 
provided in this section, no party opposing the motion may rest upon the 
mere allegations or denials of facts contained in his or her own 
pleadings. The response to the motion, by affidavit or as otherwise 
provided in this section, must provide a specific basis to show that 
there is a genuine issue of material fact for the hearing.
    (d) If it appears from the affidavit of a party opposing the motion 
that this party cannot, for reasons stated, present by affidavit matters 
essential to justify his or her opposition, the ALJ may deny the motion 
for summary decision, may order a continuance to enable the obtaining of 
information, or may make such other order as is just.
    (e) No denial of all or any part of a motion for summary decision is 
subject to interlocutory appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 20.902  Decisions of the ALJ.

    (a) After closing the record of the proceeding, the ALJ shall 
prepare a decision containing--
    (1) A finding on each material issue of fact and conclusion of law, 
and the basis for each finding;
    (2) The disposition of the case, including any appropriate order;
    (3) The date upon which the decision will become effective;
    (4) A statement of further right to appeal; and,
    (5) If no hearing was held, a statement of the right of any 
interested person to petition the Commandant to set aside the decision.
    (b) The decision of the ALJ must rest upon a consideration of the 
whole record of the proceedings.
    (c) The ALJ may, upon motion of any party or in his or her own 
discretion, render the initial decision from the bench (orally) at the 
close of the hearing and prepare and serve a written order on the 
parties or their authorized representatives. In rendering his or her 
decision from the bench, the ALJ shall state the issues in the case and 
make clear, on the record, his or her findings of fact and conclusions 
of law.
    (d) If the ALJ renders the initial decision orally, and if a party 
asks for a copy, the Hearing Docket Clerk shall furnish a copy excerpted 
from the transcript of the record. The date of the decision is the date 
of the oral rendering of the decision by the ALJ.


<R05>
Sec. 20.903  Records of proceedings.

    (a) The transcript of testimony at the hearing, all exhibits 
received into evidence, any items marked as exhibits and not received 
into evidence, all motions, all applications, all requests, and all 
rulings constitute the official record of a proceeding. This record also 
includes any motions or other matters regarding the disqualification of 
the ALJ.
    (b) Any person may examine the record of a proceeding at the U. S.

[[Page 85]]

Coast Guard Administrative Law Judge Docketing Center; Room 412; 40 S. 
Gay Street; Baltimore, MD 21201-4022. Any person may obtain a copy of 
part or all of the record after payment of reasonable costs for 
duplicating it in accordance with 49 CFR part 7.


<R05>
Sec. 20.904  Reopening.

    (a) To the extent permitted by law, the ALJ may, for good cause 
shown in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, reopen the 
record of a proceeding to take added evidence.
    (b) Any party may move to reopen the record of a proceeding 30 days 
or less after the closing of the record.
    (1) Each motion to reopen the record must clearly set forth the 
facts that the movant would try to prove and the grounds for reopening 
the record.
    (2) Any party who does not respond to any motion to reopen the 
record waives any objection to the motion.
    (c) The ALJ may reopen the record of a proceeding if he or she 
believes that any change in fact or law, or that the public interest, 
warrants reopening it.
    (d) The filing of a motion to reopen the record of a proceeding does 
not affect any period for appeals specified in subpart J of this part, 
except that the filing of such a motion tolls the running of whatever 
time remains in the period for appeals until either the ALJ acts on the 
motion or the party filing it withdraws it.
    (e)(1) At any time, a party may file a petition to reopen with the 
Docketing Center for the ALJ to rescind any order suspending or revoking 
a merchant mariner's license, certificate of registry, or document if--
    (i) The order rests on a conviction--
    (A) For violation of a dangerous-drug law;
    (B) Of an offense that would prevent the issuance or renewal of the 
license, certificate, or document; or
    (C) Of an offense described in subparagraph 205(a)(3)(A) or (B) of 
the National Driver Register Act of 1982 (23 U.S.C. 401, note); and
    (ii) The respondent submits a specific order of court to the effect 
that the conviction has been unconditionally set aside for all purposes.
    (2) The ALJ, however, may not rescind his or her order on account of 
any law that provides for a subsequent conditional setting-aside, 
modification, or expunging of the order of court, by way of granting 
clemency or other relief after the conviction has become final, without 
regard to whether punishment was imposed.
    (f) Three years or less after an S&R proceeding has resulted in 
revocation of a license, certificate, or document, the respondent may 
file a motion for reopening of the proceeding to modify the order of 
revocation with the ALJ Docketing Center.
    (1) Any motion to reopen the record must clearly state why the basis 
for the order of revocation is no longer valid and how the issuance of a 
new license, certificate, or document is compatible with the requirement 
of good discipline and safety at sea.
    (2) Any party who does not respond to any petition to reopen the 
record waives any objection to the motion.


<R04>

<R05>
Sec. 20.1001  General.

    (4) The ALJ's denial of a motion for disqualification.
    (c) No interested person may appeal a summary decision except on the 
issue that no hearing was held or that in the issuance of the decision 
the ALJ did not consider evidence that that person would have presented.
    (d) The appeal must follow the procedural requirements of this 
subpart.

[[Page 86]]


<R05>
Sec. 20.1002  Records on appeal.

    (a) The record of the proceeding constitutes the record for decision 
on appeal.

stating the authority and reason for temporary suspension.
    (b) Answer. In a case under this subpart--

cause for temporary suspension. The motion must be in writing and 
explain why the agency lacked probable cause.

[[Page 88]]

    (a) When held. As early as practicable, the ALJ shall order and 
conduct a pre-hearing conference. He or she may order the holding of the 
conference in person, or by telephonic or electronic means.
    (b) Answer. The respondent shall enter his or her answer at the pre-
hearing conference. If the answer is an admission, the ALJ shall either 
issue an appropriate order or schedule a hearing on the order.

parties. The order must specify the issues for the parties to address at 
the hearing.
    (e) Procedures not to cause delay. Neither any filing of pleadings 
or motions, nor any conduct of discovery, may interfere with--
    (1) The holding of the hearing 30 days or less after the temporary 
suspension or
    (2) The closing of the record early enough for the issuance of an 
initial decision 45 days or less after the temporary suspension.
    (f) Times. The ALJ may shorten the time for any act required or 
permitted under this subpart to enable him or her to issue an initial 
decision 45 days or less after the temporary suspension.


<R05>
Sec. 20.1208  Expedited hearings.

this part, on any issue that remains in dispute.
    (b) Oral and written argument. (1) Each party may present oral 
argument at the close of the hearing or present--
    (i) Proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law; and
    (ii) Post-hearing briefs, under Sec. 20.710.

to consider the findings and briefs without delaying the issuance of the 
decision.

Subpart M--Supplementary Evidentiary Rules for Suspension and Revocation 
                                Hearings


<R05>
Sec. 20.1301  Purpose.

    This subpart contains evidentiary rules that apply only in certain 
circumstances in S&R proceedings. They supplement, not supplant, the 
evidentiary rules in subpart H.


<R05>
Sec. 20.1303  Authentication and certification of extracts from shipping articles, logbooks, and the like.

    (a) The investigating officer, the Coast Guard representative, any 
other commissioned officer of the Coast

[[Page 89]]

Guard, or any official custodian of extracts from shipping articles, 
logbooks, or records in the custody of the Coast Guard may authenticate 
and certify the extracts.
    (b) Authentication and certification must include a statement that 
the person acting has seen the original, compared the copy with it, and 
found the copy to be a true one. This person shall sign his or her name 
and identify himself or herself by rank or title and by duty station.


<R05>
Sec. 20.1305  Admissibility and weight of entries from logbooks.

    (a) Any entry in any official logbook of a vessel concerning an 
offense enumerated in 46 U.S.C. 11501, made in substantial compliance 
with the procedural requirements of 46 U.S.C. 11502, is admissible in 
evidence and constitutes prima facie evidence of the facts recited.
    (b) Any entry in any such logbook made in substantial compliance 
with the procedural requirements of 46 U.S.C. 11502 may receive added 
weight from the ALJ.


<R05>
Sec. 20.1307  Use of judgments of conviction.

    (a) A judgment of conviction by a Federal court is conclusive in any 
S&R proceeding under this part concerning any act or offense described 
in 46 U.S.C. 7703 or 7704 when the act or offense is the same as in the 
Federal conviction.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no judgment 
of conviction by a State court is conclusive in any S&R proceeding under 
this part concerning any act or offense described in 46 U.S.C. 7703 or 
7704, even when an act or offense forming the basis of the charge in the 
proceeding is the same as in the State conviction. But the judgment is 
admissible in evidence and constitutes substantial evidence adverse to 
the respondent.
    (c) A judgment of conviction by a Federal or State court for a 
violation is conclusive in the proceeding if an S&R proceeding alleges 
conviction for--
    (1) A violation of a dangerous-drug law;
    (2) An offense that would prevent the issuance or renewal of a 
merchant mariner's license, certificate of registry, or document; or
    (3) An offense described in subparagraph 205(a)(3)(A) or (B) of the 
National Driver Register Act of 1982 (23 U.S.C.S. 401, note).
    (d) If the respondent participates in the scheme of a State for the 
expungement of convictions, and if he or she pleads guilty or no contest 
or, by order of the trial court, has to attend classes, contribute time 
or money, receive treatment, submit to any manner of probation or 
supervision, or forgo appeal of the finding of the trial court, the 
Coast Guard regards him or her, for the purposes of 46 U.S.C. 7703 or 
7704, as having received a conviction. The Coast Guard does not consider 
the conviction expunged without proof that the expungement is due to the 
conviction's having been in error.
    (e) No respondent may challenge the jurisdiction of a Federal or 
State court in any proceeding under 46 U.S.C. 7703 or 7704.


<R05>
Sec. 20.1309  Admissibility of respondents' criminal records and records with the Coast Guard before entry of findings and conclusions.

    (a) The prior disciplinary record of the respondent is admissible 
when offered by him or her.
    (b) The prior disciplinary record of the respondent is admissible 
when offered by the Coast Guard representative to impeach the 
credibility of evidence offered by the respondent.
    (c) The use of a judgment of conviction is permissible on the terms 
prescribed by Sec. 20.1307.


<R05>
Sec. 20.1311  Admissions by respondent.

    No person may testify regarding admissions made by the respondent 
during an investigation under 46 CFR part 4, except to impeach the 
credibility of evidence offered by the respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 20.1313  Medical examination of respondents.

    In any proceeding in which the physical or mental condition of the 
respondent is relevant, the ALJ may order him or her to undergo a 
medical examination. Any examination ordered

[[Page 90]]

by the ALJ is conducted, at Federal expense, by a physician designated 
by the ALJ. If the respondent fails or refuses to undergo any such 
examination, the failure or refusal receives due weight and may be 
sufficient for the ALJ to infer that the results would have been adverse 
to the respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 20.1315  Submission of prior records and evidence in aggravation or mitigation.

    (a) The prior disciplinary record of the respondent comprises the 
following items less than 10 years old:
    (1) Any written warning issued by the Coast Guard and not contested 
by the respondent.
    (2) Final agency action by the Coast Guard on any S&R proceeding in 
which a sanction or consent order was entered.
    (3) Any agreement for voluntary surrender entered into by the 
respondent.
    (4) Any final judgment of conviction in Federal or State courts.
    (5) Final agency action by the Coast Guard resulting in the 
imposition against the respondent of any civil penalty or warning in a 
proceeding administered by the Coast Guard under this title.
    (6) Any official commendatory information concerning the respondent 
of which the Coast Guard representative is aware. The Coast Guard 
representative may offer evidence and argument in aggravation of any 
charge proved. The respondent may offer evidence of, and argument on, 
prior maritime service, including both the record introduced by the 
Coast Guard representative and any commendatory evidence.
    (b) The respondent may offer evidence and argument in mitigation of 
any charge proved.
    (c) The Coast Guard representative may offer evidence and argument 
in rebuttal of any evidence and argument offered by the respondent in 
mitigation.

<R05>
Sec. 25.109  Insurance and other subrogated claims.

    (a) The claims of an insured (subrogor) and an insurer (subrogee) 
for damages arising out of the same incident constitute a single claim. 
The total award of combined claims may not exceed the monetary 
jurisdiction of the settlement authority. If the total award of the 
combined claims exceeds, or is expected to exceed, a settlement 
authority's limits, the settlement authority is not permitted to 
consider either, and the claim file will be forwarded to an appropriate 
settlement authority.
    (b) An insured (subrogor) and an insurer (subrogee) may file a claim 
jointly or separately. If the insurer has fully reimbursed the insured, 
payment will only be made to the insurer. If separate claims are filed, 
the settlement will be made payable to each claimant to the extent of 
that claimant's undisputed interest. If joint claims are filed, the 
settlement will be sent to the insurer.
    (c) Each claimant shall include with a claim, a written disclosure 
concerning insurance coverage including:
    (1) The names and addresses of all insurers;
    (2) The kind and amount of insurance;
    (3) The policy number;
    (4) Whether a claim has been or will be presented to an insurer, 
and, if so, the amount of that claim; and whether the insurer has paid 
the claim in whole or in part, or has indicated payment will be made.
    (d) Each subrogee shall substantiate an interest or right to file a 
claim by appropriate documentary evidence and shall support the claim as 
to liability and measure of damages in the same manner as required of 
any other claimant. Documentary evidence of payment to a subrogor does 
not constitute evidence of liability of the United States or conclusive 
evidence of the amount of damages. The settlement authority makes an 
independent determination on the issues of fact and law based upon the 
evidence of record.
    (e) An insurance or other subrogated claim is not payable under 
Subpart E, F, or G of this part.

    The following evidence must be presented when appropriate:
    (a) For each particular lost item, evidence of its value such as a 
bill of sale and a written appraisal, or two written appraisals, from 
separate disinterested dealers or brokers, market quotations, commercial 
catalogs, or other evidence of the price at which like property can be 
obtained in the community. The settlement authority may waive these 
requirements when circumstances warrant. The cost of any appraisal may 
be included as an element of damage if not deductible from any bill 
submitted to claimant.
    (b) For each particular damaged item which can be economically 
repaired, evidence of cost of repairs such as a receipted bill and one 
estimate, or two estimates, from separate disinterested repairmen. The 
settlement authority may waive these requirements when circumstances 
warrant. The cost of any estimate may be included as an element of 
damage if not deductible from any repair bill submitted to claimant.
    (c) For any claim which may result in payment in excess of 
$20,000.00, a survey or appraisal shall be performed as soon as 
practicable after the damage accrues, and, unless waived in writing, 
shall be performed jointly with a government representative.
    (d) If the item is so severely damaged that it cannot be 
economically repaired or used, it shall be treated as a lost item.
    (e) If a claim includes loss of earnings or use during repairs to 
the damaged property, the following must also be furnished and supported 
by competent evidence:
    (1) The date the property was damaged;

[[Page 96]]

    (5) The date and place the property was returned to service after 
completion of repairs, and an explanation, if applicable, of any delay;
    (6) Whether or not a substitute for the damaged property was 
available. If a substitute was used by the claimant during the time of 
repair, an explanation of the necessity of using the substitute, how it 
was used, and for how long, and the costs involved. Any costs incurred 
that would have been similarly incurred by the claimant in using the 
damaged property must be identified;
    (7) Whether or not during the course of undergoing repairs the 
property would have been used, and an explanation submitted showing the 
identity of the person who offered that use, the terms of the offer, 
time of prospective service, and rate of compensation; and
    (8) If at the time of damage the property was under charter or hire, 
or was otherwise employed, or would have been employed, the claimant 
shall submit a statement of operating expenses that were, or would have 
been, incurred. This statement shall include wages and all bonuses which 
would have been paid, the value of fuel and the value of consumable

    (f) For each item which is lost, actual or constructive, proof of 
ownership.


<R05>
Sec. 25.121  Effect of other payments to claimant.

    The total amount to which the claimant may be entitled is normally 
computed as follows:
    (a) The total amount of the loss, damage, or personal injury 
suffered for which the United States is liable, less any payment the 
claimant has received from the following sources:
    (1) The military member or civilian employee who caused the 
incident;
    (2) The military member's or civilian employee's insurer; and
    (3) Any joint tort-feasor or insurer.
    (b) No deduction is generally made for any payment the claimant has 
received by way of voluntary contributions, such as donations of 
charitable organizations.


<R05>
Sec. 25.123  Settlement and notice to claimant.

    (a) If the settlement authority determines that the full amount 
claimed should be paid, the settlement authority forwards the claim to 
the disbursing officer for payment. If the time involved in settling the 
claim has been extensive, the settlement authority notifies the 
claimant.
    (b) If the settlement authority determines that less than the full 
amount claimed should be paid, the settlement authority:
    (1) Notifies the claimant in writing of the proposed settlement.
    (2) Obtains from the claimant written acceptance and release for 
payment of the claim in the reduced amount.
    (3) Advises the claimant, in the event claimant does not desire to 
accept the offer, to reply within 45 days giving reasons for rejection.
    (4) Except upon a showing of good cause for delay in accepting a 
proposed settlement within 45 days, treats the non-acceptance as a 
rejection. Rejection by a claimant of an offer of settlement renders the 
offer void.
    (5) If a claimant rejects a proposed settlement or fails to reply 
within 45 days, the settlement authority may make further efforts to 
settle the claim. When the settlement authority determines that further 
efforts to settle the claim are not warranted, the settlement authority 
notifies the claimant in writing by registered or certified mail, return 
receipt requested, that the claim has been denied because the amount 
claimed is excessive.
    (c) If the claim is denied, the settlement authority notifies the 
claimant in writing by registered or certified mail, return receipt 
requested.


<R05>
Sec. 25.125  Appeal.

    The final denial of a claim by a settlement authority or a partial 
approval

[[Page 97]]

by a settlement authority is not subject to appeal except under the 
procedures prescribed for Military Claims in Subpart D of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 25.127  Reconsideration.

    (a) The settlement authority may reconsider a claim upon the 
authority's own initiative or upon request of the claimant or someone 
acting on the claimant's behalf.
    (b) A request for reconsideration must be in writing and include the 
legal or factual grounds for the relief requested.
    (c) Following any investigation or other action deemed necessary for 
reconsideration of the original action, the settlement authority 
reconsiders the claim and if warranted attempts to settle it. When 
further settlement efforts appear unwarranted, the settlement authority 
notifies the claimant in writing by certified or registered mail, return 
receipt requested, that the relief requested is denied.
    (d) For the effect of reconsideration under the Federal Tort Claims 
Act see 28 CFR Part 14.


<R05>
Sec. 25.129  Acceptance of offer of settlement.

    Claimant's acceptance of an offer of settlement is a complete 
release of any claim against the United States and against the military 
or civilian personnel of the Coast Guard whose act or omission gave rise 
to the claim.

Notes:
 
\1\ VTS regulations are denoted in 33 CFR 161. All geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) are expressed
  in North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83).
\2\ In the event of a communication failure either by the vessel traffic center or the vessel or radio
  congestion on a designated VTS frequency, communications may be established on an alternate VTS frequency. The
  bridge-to-bridge navigational frequency, 156.650 MHz (Channel 13), is monitored in each VTS area; and it may
  be used as an alternate frequency, however, only to the extent that doing so provides a level of safety beyond
  that provided by other means.
\3\Designated frequency monitoring is required within U.S. navigable waters. In areas which are outside the U.S.
  navigable waters, designated frequency monitoring is voluntary. However, prospective VTS Users are encouraged
  to monitor the designated frequency.
\4\VMRS participants shall make their initial report (Sail Plan) to New York Traffic on Channel 11 (156.550
  MHz). All other reports, including the Final Report, shall be made on Channel 14 (156.700 MHz). VMRS and other
  VTS Users shall monitor Channel 14 (156.700 MHz) while transiting the VTS area. New York Traffic may direct a
  vessel to monitor and report on either primary frequency depending on traffic density, weather conditions, or
  other safety factors. This does not require a vessel to monitor both primary frequencies.
\5\ A Cooperative Vessel Traffic Service was established by the United States and Canada within adjoining
  waters. The appropriate vessel traffic center administers the rules issued by both nations; however, it will
  enforce only its own set of rules within its jurisdiction.

[[Page 106]]

 
\6\ Seattle Traffic may direct a vessel to monitor the other primary VTS frequency 156.250 MHz (Channel 5A or
  14) depending on traffic density, weather conditions, or other safety factors, rather than strictly adhering
  to the designated frequency required for each monitoring area as defined above. This does not require a vessel
  to monitor both primary frequencies.
\7\A portion of Tofino Sector's monitoring area extends beyond the defined CVTS area. Designated frequency
  monitoring is voluntary in these portions outside of VTS jurisdiction, however, prospective VTS Users are
  encouraged to monitor the designated frequency.
\8\The bridge-to-bridge navigational frequency, 156.650 MHz (Channel 13), is used in these VTSs because the
  level of radiotelephone transmissions does not warrant a designated VTS frequency. The listening watch
  required by 26.05 of this chapter is not limited to the monitoring area.

Sec. 26.04  Use of the designated frequency.

    (a) No person may use the frequency designated by the Federal 
Communications Commission under section 8 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 1207(a), 
to transmit any information other than information necessary for the 
safe navigation of vessels or necessary tests.
    (b) Each person who is required to maintain a listening watch under 
section 5 of the Act shall, when necessary, transmit and confirm, on the 
designated frequency, the intentions of his vessel and any other 
information necessary for the safe navigation of vessels.
    (c) Nothing in these regulations may be construed as prohibiting the 
use of the designated frequency to communicate with shore stations to 
obtain or furnish information necessary for the safe navigation of 
vessels.
    (d) On the navigable waters of the United States, channel 13 (156.65 
MHz) is the designated frequency required to be monitored in accordance 
with Sec. 26.05(a) except that in the area prescribed in Sec. 26.03(e), 
channel 67 (156.375 MHz) is the designated frequency.
    (e) On those navigable waters of the United States within a VTS 
area, the designated VTS frequency is an additional designated frequency 
required to be monitored in accordance with Sec. 26.05.

Sec. 26.05  Use of radiotelephone.

    Section 5 of the Act states that the radiotelephone required by this 
Act is for the exclusive use of the master or person in charge of the 
vessel, or the person designated by the master or person in charge to 
pilot or direct the movement of the vessel, who shall maintain a 
listening watch on the designated frequency. Nothing herein shall be 
interpreted as precluding the use of portable radiotelephone equipment 
to satisfy the requirements of this act.

Sec. 26.06  Maintenance of radiotelephone; failure of radiotelephone.

    Section 6 of the Act states:

    (a) Whenever radiotelephone capability is required by this Act, a 
vessel's radiotelephone equipment shall be maintained in effective 
operating condition. If the radiotelephone equipment carried aboard a 
vessel ceases to operate, the master shall exercise due diligence to 
restore it or cause it to be restored to effective operating condition 
at the earliest practicable time. The failure of a vessel's 
radiotelephone equipment shall not, in itself, constitute a violation of 
this Act, nor shall it obligate the master of any vessel to moor or 
anchor his vessel; however, the loss of radiotelephone capability shall 
be given consideration in the navigation of the vessel.


<R05>
Sec. 26.07  Communications.

    No person may use the services of, and no person may serve as, a 
person required to maintain a listening watch under section 5 of the 
Act, 33 U.S.C. 1204, unless the person can communicate in the English 
language.

facility, where the alleged incompetent is receiving treatment or to 
which his case may be conveniently referred, a board of not less than 
three qualified medical officers, one of whom shall be specially 
qualified in the treatment of mental disorders, to determine whether the

    The trustee or trustees appointed to receive moneys in behalf of

furnished shall have as surety a company approved by the Federal 
Government, and shall be in such amount as is required by the

trusteeship and expenses in connection with the furnishing and renewal 
of such bonds may be paid out of sums due the incompetent.


<R05>

    The trustee or trustees appointed to receive moneys due incompetent

as trustee or trustees.

receipt indicating that the surety bond required by Sec. 49.05-5 has 
been renewed. When the trustee is the spouse or adult dependent of the 
incompetent, receipts or vouchers need not be filed for expenditures 
made for living expenses. If the trustee or trustees fail to report 
promptly and properly at the end of any annual period or at such other 
times as the Commandant desires, the Commandant may, in his discretion, 
cause payment to such trustee or trustees to cease, and may, if deemed 
advisable, appoint another person or persons not under legal disability 
so to act, to receive future payments of moneys due the incompetent for 
the use and benefit of the incompetent.


<R05>

trustees.

appropriate, appoint a successor trustee or trustees. The successor

all acts in the manner required of the original trustee or trustees.

<R05>
Sec. 51.1  Basis and purpose.

    This part establishes the procedures for review of administrative 
discharges from the Coast Guard by a Discharge Review Board (DRB) or by 
the Secretary of the Department, and for the compilation of the record 
of the DRB determination, made available for public inspection, copying 
and distribution through the Armed Forces Discharge Review/Correction 
Board Reading Room.


<R05>
Sec. 51.2  Authority.

    (a) The Secretary of Transportation has the authority to establish a 
Discharge Review Board (DRB) to review the discharge of a former member 
of the United States Coast Guard under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1553. 
This part prescribes the establishment and outlines the procedures of 
the Coast Guard Discharge Review Board. The Secretary retains the 
authority to review and take final action on the DRB's findings in the 
following cases:
    (1) Those cases in which a minority of the board requests that their 
written opinion be forwarded to the Secretary for consideration;
    (2) Those cases selected by the Commandant to inform the Secretary

Secretary;
    (3) Any case in which the Secretary demonstrates an interest;

<R05>
Sec. 51.3  Applicability and scope.

    The provisions of this part apply to the United States Coast Guard 
including reserve-components and all former members who have been 
discharged within 15 years of the date upon which application for review 
is received by the DRB. A former member may apply to the DRB for a 
change in the character of, and/or the reason for, the discharge. The 
Coast Guard DRB review is generally applicable only to administrative 
discharges, however, the DRB may review the discharge of a former member 
by sentence of a court-martial for the purpose of clemency. A petition 
for clemency will not be considered by the DRB unless the applicant has 
exhausted all appellate remedies. Upon a petition for clemency, the DRB 
shall consider only the equity of the discharge awarded.


<R05>
Sec. 51.4  Definitions.

    Applicant. A former member of the Coast Guard who has been 
discharged from the service but excluding those discharged by sentence 
of a court-martial, except as provided in Sec. 51.3. If the former 
member is deceased or incompetent, the term ``applicant'' includes the 
surviving spouse, next-of-kin, or legal representative who is acting on 
behalf of the former member.
    Counsel. An individual or agency designated by the applicant who 
agrees to represent the applicant in a case before the DRB. It includes, 
but is not limited to: A lawyer who is a member of the bar of a federal 
court or of the highest court of a state; an accredited representative 
designated by an organization recognized by the Administrator of 
Veterans Affairs; a representative from a state agency concerned with 
veterans affairs; or a representative from private organizations or 
local government agencies.
    Discharge. Any formal separation of a member from the Coast Guard 
which is not termed ``honorable'', including dismissals and ``dropping 
from the rolls''. This term also includes the assignment of a separation 
program designator, separation authority, the stated reason for the 
discharge, and the characterization of service.
    Discharge Review. The process by which the reason for separation, 
the procedures followed in accomplishing separation, and the 
characterization of service are evaluated. This includes determinations 
made under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3103(e)(2).
    Discharge Review Board. A board consisting of five members of the 
U.S. Coast Guard, appointed by the Commandant of the Coast Guard and 
vested with the authority to review the discharge of a former member. 
The board is empowered to change a discharge or issue a new discharge to 
reflect its findings, subject to review by the Commandant or the 
Secretary.
    Hearing. A proceeding which, upon request of the applicant, is 
utilized in the discharge review process enabling the applicant and/or 
the applicant's representative to appear before the DRB and present 
evidence.
    President. An officer of the United States Coast Guard appointed by 
the Commandant as President to preside over the DRB. The President will 
convene the board and may also serve as a member. If the President does 
not serve as a member of the DRB, the President shall designate a 
presiding officer for the board to serve as President.

33663, June 28, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 51.5  Objective of review.

    The objective of the discharge review is to examine the propriety 
and equity of the applicant's discharge and to effect changes if 
necessary. The DRB will utilize its discretion to reach a fair and just 
resolution of the applicant's claim. The standards of review and the 
underlying factors which aid in determining whether the standards are 
met shall be historically consistent with criteria for determining 
honorable service. No factors shall be established which require 
automatic change, or denial of change, in a discharge.

[[Page 124]]


<R05>
Sec. 51.6  Propriety standard of review.

    A discharge is deemed to be proper except that:
    (a) A discharge may be improper if an error of fact, law, procedure, 
or discretion was associated with the discharge at the time of issuance 
which prejudiced the rights of the applicant.
    (b) A discharge may be improper if there has been a change in policy 
by the Coast Guard made expressly retroactive to the type of discharge 
under consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 51.7  Equity standard of review.

    (a) A discharge is presumed to be equitable and will not be changed 
under this section unless the applicant submits evidence sufficient to 
establish, to the satisfaction of the DRB that:
    (1) The policies and procedures under which the applicant was 
discharged differ in material respects from policies and procedures 
currently applicable on a service-wide basis to discharges of that type, 
provided that current policies or procedures represent a substantial 
enhancement of the rights afforded a party in such proceedings, and 
there is substantial doubt that the applicant would have received the 
same discharge if relevant current policies and procedures had been 
available to the applicant at the time of the discharge proceedings 
under consideration; or
    (2) At the time of issuance, the discharge was inconsistent with 
standards of discipline in the Coast Guard; or
    (3) The applicant's military record and other evidence presented to 
the DRB, viewed in conjunction with the factors listed in Sec. 51.8 and 
the regulations under which the applicant was discharged, do not fairly 
justify the type of discharge received.
    (b) If the applicant was discharged with a characterized discharge 
before June 15, 1983, a change from the characterized discharge to an 
uncharacterized discharge will not be considered under the provisions of 
(a)(1) of this section unless specifically requested by the applicant. A 
determination that a discharge is inequitable according to the 
provisions of (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section shall entitle the 
applicant to a discharge of a type to which the applicant was entitled 
at the time the original discharge was issued.


<R05>
Sec. 51.8  Relevant considerations.

    In determining the equity and propriety of a former member's 
discharge, the DRB shall consider all relevant evidence presented by the 
applicant. The DRB review will include, but is not limited to, 
consideration of the following factors:
    (a) The quality of the applicant's service. In determining the 
quality of the applicant's service, the DRB may consider the applicant's 
dates and periods of service; rate or rank achieved; marks and 
evaluations received; awards, decorations and letters of commendation; 
acts of merit; combat service and wounds received; promotions and 
demotions; prior military service and type of discharge; records of 
unauthorized absence; records of non-judicial punishment; convictions by 
court-martial; records of conviction by civil authorities while a member 
of the Coast Guard; and any other relevant information respecting the 
applicant which is brought to the board's attention.
    (b) The applicant's capability to serve. In determining the 
applicant's capability to serve, the DRB considers such factors as the 
applicant's age and education; qualification for reenlistment; 
capability to adjust to military service; and family or personal 
problems.
    (c) Any evidence of arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory actions 
by individuals in authority over the applicant.
    (d) Any other information respecting the applicant considered by the 
DRB to be relevant and material to the review of the applicant's 
discharge.


<R05>
Sec. 51.9  Discharge review procedures.

    (a) Preliminary. Prior to a review, applicants or their 
representatives may obtain copies of military records by submitting a 
Standard Form 180, Request Pertaining to Military Records, to the 
National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), 9799 Page Boulevard, St. 
Louis, MO. 72132. The request to the NPRC should be submitted prior to 
submitting the application for review, so that relevant information from 
the

[[Page 125]]

record can be included with the application.
    (b) Initiation of review. Review may be initiated by an applicant or 
by the DRB. The applicant may apply for DRB review of discharge by 
submitting DD Form 293, Application for Review of Discharge or 
Separation from the Armed Forces of the United States, along with any 
other statements, affidavits or documentation desired by the applicant. 
The application must be received by the DRB within fifteen (15) years of 
the date of the discharge. The application form can be obtained, along 
with explanatory matter, from Commandant, (G-WPM), U.S. Coast Guard 
Headquarters, 2100 2nd Street SW., Washington, DC 20593, any regional VA 
office, or by writing to the Armed Forces Review/Correction Board 
Reading Room, Pentagon Concourse, Washington, DC 20310.
    (c) Notice. (1) The DRB will provide notification advising the 
former member of--
    (i) Receipt of the applicant's request;
    (ii) The right to appear before the board in person or by counsel; 
and
    (iii) The date of review.

If the former member is deceased, written notice of DRB review will be 
sent to the surviving spouse, next of kin or legal representative of the 
former member. If the review is initiated by the DRB, notification will 
be sent to the last known address of the former member.
    (2) Prior to the initiation of the decision process, the DRB will 
notify the former member of the date by which requests to examine the 
documents to be considered by the board must be received. This notice 
will also state the date by which a request for a hearing must be made 
and the deadline for filing responses to the board.
    (3) An applicant who requests a hearing will be notified of the time 
and place of the hearing. All expenses incurred by the applicant in DRB 
proceedings and hearings are the sole responsibility of the applicant 
and are not obligations of the U.S. Coast Guard or the Department of 
Transportation. If the applicant fails to appear, except as provided in 
Sec. 51.9(f), the DRB will review the discharge and reach a decision 
based upon the evidence of record.
    (d) Withdrawal of application. An applicant may withdraw an 
application without prejudice at any time before the scheduled review. 
An application which is withdrawn will not stay the running of the 15 
year statutory limitation imposed on the authority of the DRB to review 
the discharge.
    (e) The DRB will consider the records and other data submitted by 
the applicant. The DRB may consider other probative evidence provided 
that all materials relied on by the DRB, except classified documents, 
are made available to the applicant and applicant's representative prior 
to the hearing date (or review date if no hearing is requested). The DRB 
shall not consider a classified document in the review of a discharge 
unless a summary of, or extract from, the document (deleting all 
reference to sources of information and other matters, the disclosure of 
which would, in the opinion of the classifying authority, be detrimental 
to the security interests of the United States) is made available to the 
applicant.
    (f) Postponement of review or hearing. At any time before the date 
of scheduled review or hearing, an applicant may be granted a 
continuance, provided the applicant or the applicant's counsel makes a 
written request for additional time to the DRB which shows good cause to 
justify the postponement.
    (g) Hearing procedures. The following procedures apply to DRB 
hearings:
    (1) DRB hearings are not public. Presence at hearings is limited to 
persons authorized by the Commandant or expressly requested by the 
applicant, subject to reasonable limitations based upon available space.
    (2) The Federal Rules of Evidence are not applicable to DRB 
proceedings. The presiding officer rules on matters of procedure and 
ensures that reasonable bounds of relevancy and materiality are adhered 
to in the taking of evidence.
    (3) An applicant is permitted to make a sworn or unsworn statement. 
Witness testimony will only be taken under oath or affirmation. An 
applicant or witness who makes a statement may be questioned by the DRB.

[[Page 126]]

    (4) An applicant may make oral or written argument personally or 
through his or her representative.
    (h) Reconsideration. The decision of the DRB may not be reconsidered 
unless--
    (1) The only previous consideration of the case was on the motion of 
the DRB;
    (2) Changes in discharge policy occur; or
    (3) New, substantial, relevant evidence, not available to the 
applicant at the time of the original review, is submitted to the DRB.

33663, June 28, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 51.10  Decisions.

    (a) The DRB will make written findings and conclusions with respect 
to all disputed facts and issues. The decision of the DRB is governed by 
the vote of a majority of the board.
    (b) A decision document is prepared for each review conducted by the 
DRB. This document contains--
    (1) The date, character of, and reason for the discharge including 
the specific authority under which the discharge was issued;
    (2) The specific change(s) requested by the applicant;
    (3) A list of the issues raised by the applicant;
    (4) The circumstances and character of the applicant's service, as 
extracted from the service record, health record and other evidence 
presented to the DRB;
    (5) References to documentary evidence, testimony or other material 
relied on by the DRB in support of its decision;
    (6) A statement of the DRB's findings with respect to each issue 
raised by the applicant;
    (7) A summary of the rationale and a statement of the DRB's 
conclusions as to whether any change, correction or modification should 
be made in the type or character of the discharge or the reason and 
authority for the discharge; and
    (8) A statement of the particular changes, correction, or 
modification made by the DRB.


<R05>
Sec. 51.11  Records.

    (a) The record of the discharge review will include--
    (1) The application for review;
    (2) A summarized record of the testimony and a summary of evidence 
considered by the DRB other than information contained in the service 
records;
    (3) Briefs or written arguments submitted by or on behalf of the 
applicant;
    (4) The decision of the DRB;
    (5) Advisory opinions relief upon for the final action; and
    (6) The final action on the DRB decision by the Commandant or 
Secretary.
    (b) The record of the discharge review is incorporated into the 
service record of the applicant.
    (c) A copy of the decision of the DRB and the final action thereon 
is made available for public inspection and copying promptly after a 
notice of the final decision is sent to the applicant. However, to the 
extent required for the protection of privacy rights, identifying 
details of the applicant and other persons are deleted from the public 
record.
    (1) DRB documents made available for public inspection and copying 
are located in the Armed Forces Discharge Review/Correction Board 
Reading Room. The documents are indexed so as to enable the public to 
determine why relief was granted or denied. The index includes the case 
number, the date, character of, reason for, and authority for the 
discharge and is maintained at Coast Guard Headquarters and the Armed 
Forces Reading Room. The Armed Forces Discharge Review/Correction Board 
Reading Room publishes indexes quarterly for all boards.
    (2) Correspondence relating to matters under the cognizance of the 
Reading Room (including requests for purchase of indexes) should be 
addressed to: Armed Forces Discharge Review/Correction Board Reading 
Room, The Pentagon Concourse, Washington, DC 20310.

                    Subpart A--Purpose and Authority


<R05>
Sec. 52.1  Purpose.

    This part establishes the procedure for application for correction 
of military records of the Coast Guard, for consideration of 
applications by the Department of Transportation Board for Correction of 
Military Records of the Coast Guard (hereinafter ``the Board''), and for 
settling claims or determining monetary benefits.


<R05>
Sec. 52.2  Authority.

    (a) The Secretary of Transportation, acting through boards of 
civilians, is authorized to correct any military record of the Coast 
Guard when the Secretary considers it necessary to correct an error or 
remove an injustice. 10 U.S.C. 1552. Section 212 of the Coast Guard 
Authorization Act of 1989 provides that the Secretary shall ensure that 
final action on a complete application for correction is taken within 10 
months of its receipt.
    (b) Corrections made under this authority are final and conclusive 
on all officers of the Government except when procured by fraud.


<R04>
      Subpart B--Establishment, Function, and Jurisdiction of Board


<R05>
Sec. 52.11  Establishment and composition.

    (a) Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1552 and 49 U.S.C. 108(a), the Board for 
Correction of Military Records of the Coast Guard is established in the 
Office of the Secretary of Transportation.
    (b) The Secretary appoints a panel of civilian officers or employees 
of the Department of Transportation to serve as members of the Board, 
and designates one such member to serve as Chairman of the Board. The 
Chairman designates members from this panel to

[[Page 128]]

serve as the Board for each case requiring consideration by a Board. The 
Board consists of three members, and two members present constitute a 
quorum of the Board.
    (c) The Deputy Chairman of the Board exercises the functions 
prescribed by these regulations and such other duties as may be assigned 
by the Chairman.


<R05>
Sec. 52.12  Function.

    The function of the Board is to consider all applications properly 
before it, together with all pertinent military records to determine:
    (a) Whether an error has been made in the applicant's Coast Guard 
military record, whether the applicant has suffered an error or 
injustice as the result of an omission or commission in his or her 
record, or whether the applicant has suffered some manifest injustice in 
the treatment accorded him or her; and
    (b) Whether the Board finds it necessary to change a military record 
to correct an error or remove an injustice.


<R05>
Sec. 52.13  Jurisdiction.

    (a) The Board has jurisdiction to review and determine all matters 
properly brought before it, consistent with existing law and such 
directives as may be issued by the Secretary.
    (b) No application shall be considered by the Board until the 
applicant has exhausted all effective administrative remedies afforded 
under existing law or regulations, and such legal remedies as the Board 
may determine are practical, appropriate, and available to the 
applicant.


<R04>
          Subpart C--General Provisions Regarding Applications


<R05>
Sec. 52.21  General requirements.

    (a) An application for correction of a Coast Guard record shall be 
submitted on DD Form 149 (Application for Correction of Military or 
Naval Record) or an exact copy thereof, and shall be addressed to: 
Chairman, Board for Correction of Military Records of the Coast Guard 
(C-60), United States Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 
20590. Forms and explanatory material may be obtained from the Chairman 
of the Board.
    (b) The application shall be signed by the person alleging error or 
injustice in his or her military record, except that an application may 
be signed by a family member or legal representative with respect to the 
record of a deceased, incapacitated, or missing person.
    (c) No application shall be processed until it is complete. An 
application for relief is complete when all of the following have been 
received by the Board:
    (1) A signed DD Form 149, providing all necessary responses, 
including a specific allegation of error or injustice, accompanied by 
substantial proof in support of such allegation;
    (2) The military records of the applicant; and
    (3) Any applicable Department of Veterans Affairs medical records.


<R05>
Sec. 52.22  Time limit for filing application.

    An application for correction of a record must be filed within three 
years after the applicant discovered or reasonably should have 
discovered the alleged error or injustice. If an application is 
untimely, the applicant shall set forth reasons in the application why 
its acceptance is in the interest of justice. An untimely application 
shall be denied unless the Board finds that sufficient evidence has been 
presented to warrant a finding that it would be in the interest of 
justice to excuse the failure to file timely.


<R05>
Sec. 52.23  Counsel.

    As used in this part, the term ``counsel'' includes attorneys who 
are members in good standing of any bar; accredited representatives of 
veterans' organizations recognized by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs 
pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3402; and other persons who, in the opinion of the 
Board, are competent to represent the applicant for correction. Whenever 
the term ``applicant'' is used in these rules, except in Sec. 52.21, the 
term shall mean an applicant or his or her counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 52.24  Evidence.

    It is the responsibility of the applicant to procure such evidence, 
including official records, as the applicant

[[Page 129]]

    The applicant shall have access to official records or to any 
information pertaining to the applicant which is in the custody of the

have access to other Coast Guard records as provided in 49 CFR part 7.


<R05>
Sec. 52.26  Withdrawal.

    The board may, in its discretion, permit the applicant to withdraw 
his or her application at any time before a final determination by the 
Secretary. Any further consideration by the Board of the issues raised 
in the withdrawn application shall occur only upon the filing of a new 
application.


<R04>

                               Proceedings


<R05>
Sec. 52.31  Consideration of application.

    Each application shall be reviewed by the Chairman to determine 
whether it meets the requirements of Sec. 52.21(c). The Chairman shall 
decide in appropriate cases whether to grant a hearing or to recommend 
disposition on the merits without a hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 52.32  Denial of relief.

    (a) The Chairman may, notwithstanding Sec. 52.64, and without 
written findings and conclusons, deny in writing all requested relief to 
an applicant at any time prior to consideration of the applicant's case 
by a Board if:
    (1) The information or evidence submited by the applicant is 
insufficient to demonstrate probable substantial error or injustice;
    (2) Effective relief cannot be granted by the Board;
    (3) The Board does not have jurisdiction to determine the issues 
presented; or
    (4) The application has not been timely filed under Sec. 52.22 and 
the interest of justice does not require its acceptance.
    (b) Denial of relief pursuant to this section is without prejudice 
to further considration by the Board if the applicant requests further 
consideration and submits evidence in addition to that contained in his 
or her complete application. A request for further consideration shall 
be regarded as a new application for purpose of Sec. 52.68.
    (c) If relief is denied under this section, the applicant shall be 
advised of the right to further proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 52.33  Stay of proceedings.

    An application to the Board for correction of a military record does 
not operate as a stay of any proceeding or administrative action taken 
with respect to or affecting the applicant.

<R05>

[[Page 130]]


<R05>
Sec. 52.45  Nonappearance.

    An applicant who fails without good cause to appear in person or by 
counsel at the appointed date, time, and place for hearing, is deemed to 
have waived the right to a hearing. The application is then considered 
by the Board on the basis of all the material of record.

finds that it would be in the interest of justice to consider the 
request despite its untimeliness.

Member of Congress or an Inspector General;

specialist to ensure proper presentation of the legal issues in the 
case; and
    (3) The Coast Guard member is not represented by outside counsel 
chosen by the member.
    (d) If the Board elects to hold an administrative hearing, the Board 
must ensure that the Coast Guard member may examine witnesses through 
deposition, serve interrogatories, and request the production of 
evidence, including evidence in the Inspector General investigatory 
record but not included in the report released to the member.

<R05>
Sec. 62.1  Purpose.

    (a) The Coast Guard administers the U.S. Aids to Navigation System. 
The system consists of Federal aids to navigation operated by the Coast 
Guard, aids to navigation operated by the other armed services, and 
private aids to navigation operated by other persons.
    (b)(1) This part describes the general characteristics of the U.S. 
Aids to Navigation System, and the details, policies and procedures 
employed by the Coast Guard in establishing, maintaining, operating, 
changing or discontinuing Federal aids to navigation. Regulations 
concerning the marking of wrecks, structures, and other obstructions are 
found in 33 CFR part 64. Regulations concerning private aids are found 
in 33 CFR part 66. Regulations concerning the marking of artificial 
islands and structures which are erected on or over the seabed and 
subsoil of the Outer Continental Shelf of the United States or its 
possessions are found in 33 CFR part 67. Regulations concerning the 
marking of bridges are found in 33 CFR part 118. Regulations concerning 
aids to navigation at deepwater ports are found in subchapter NN of this 
chapter.
    (2) The regulations found in 33 CFR subpart 66.10 expire on December 
31, 2003, at which time the provisions of this part will apply.
    (c) The Coast Guard maintains systems of marine aids to navigation 
consisting of visual, audible, and electronic signals which are designed 
to assist the prudent mariner in the process of navigation. The aids to 
navigation system is not intended to identify every shoal or obstruction 
to navigation which exists in the navigable waters of the United States, 
but rather provides for reasonable marking of marine features as 
resources permit. The primary objective of the aids to navigation system 
is to mark navigable channels and waterways, obstructions

[[Page 143]]

adjacent to these waterways, and obstructions in areas of general 
navigation which may not be anticipated. Other waters, even if 
navigable, are generally not marked.

<R05>
Sec. 62.5  Marking of marine parades and regattas.

    (a) The Coast Guard may establish aids to navigation to mark marine 
parades and regattas which are regulated by the Coast Guard for the 
purpose of protecting life and property, or to assist in the observance 
and enforcement of special regulations. For marine parade and regatta 
regulations, see Part 100 of this chapter.

              Subpart B--The U.S. Aids to Navigation System


<R05>
Sec. 62.21  General.

    (a) The navigable waters of the United States and non-navigable 
State waters after December 31, 2003, are marked to assist navigation 
using the U.S. Aids to Navigation System, a system consistent with the 
International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) Maritime 
Buoyage System. The IALA Maritime Buoyage System is followed by most of 
the world's maritime nations and will improve maritime safety by 
encouraging conformity in buoyage systems worldwide. IALA buoyage is 
divided into two regions made up of Region A and Region B. All navigable 
waters of the United States follow IALA Region B, except U.S. 
possessions west of the International Date Line and south of 10 degrees 
north latitude, which follow IALA Region A. Lateral aids to navigation 
in Region A vary from those described throughout this Subpart. Non-
lateral aids to navigation are the same as those used in Region B. See 
Sec. 62.25. Appropriate nautical charts and publications should be 
consulted to determine whether the Region A or Region B marking schemes 
are in effect for a given area.
    (b) The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is designed for use with 
nautical charts. Nautical charts portray the physical features of the 
marine environment, including soundings and other submarine features, 
landmarks, and other aids necessary for the proper navigation of a 
vessel. This crucial information cannot be obtained from other sources, 
even ones such as topographic maps, aeronautical charts, or atlases. The 
exact meaning of an aid to navigation may not be clear to the mariner 
unless the appropriate chart is consulted, as the chart illustrates the 
relationship of the individual aid to navigation to channel limits, 
obstructions, hazards to navigation, and to the total aids to navigation 
system.
    (c) The navigator should maintain and consult suitable publications 
and

[[Page 144]]

instruments for navigation depending on the vessel's requirements. This 
shipboard equipment is separate from the aids to navigation system, but 
is often essential to its use. The following publications are available 
from the U.S. Government to assist the navigator:
    (1) The Light List, published by the Coast Guard and available 
through the Government Printing Office or authorized sales agents, lists 
federal and private aids to navigation. It includes all major Federal 
aids to navigation and those private aids to navigation, which have been 
deemed to be important to general navigation, and includes a physical 
description of these aids and their locations.
    (2) The United States Coast Pilot, published by the National Ocean 
Service and available through that agency or authorized nautical chart 
sales agents, supplements the information shown on nautical charts. 
Subjects such as local navigation regulations, channel and anchorage 
peculiarities, dangers, climatalogical data, routes, and port facilities 
are covered.
    (3) Local Notices to Mariners are published by local Coast Guard 
District Commanders. Persons may be placed on the mailing list to 
receive local Notices by contacting the Aids to Navigation and Waterway 
Management Branch of the appropriate Coast Guard District. These notices 
pass information affecting navigation safety. Changes to aids to 
navigation, reported dangers, scheduled construction or other 
disruptions, chart corrections and similar useful marine information is 
made available through this publication.
    (4) The Notice to Mariners is a national publication similar to the 
Local Notice to Mariners, published by the Defense Mapping Agency, and 
available by writing: Director, Defense Mapping Agency, Combat Support 
Center, Code PMSA, Washington, DC 20315-0010. A letter of justification 
should be included in the request. This publication provides ocean going 
vessels significant national and international navigation and safety 
information.
    (5) The mariner should also listen to Coast Guard Broadcast Notices 
to Mariners. These broadcasts update the Local Notice to Mariners with 
more timely information. Mariners should monitor VHF-FM channel 16 to 
locate Coast Guard Marine Information Broadcasts.
    (d) The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is primarily a lateral system 
which employs a simple arrangement of colors, shapes, numbers, and light 
characteristics to mark the limits of navigable routes. This lateral 
system is supplemented by nonlateral aids to navigation where 
appropriate.
    (e) Generally, lateral aids to navigation indicate on which side of 
a vessel an aid to navigation should be passed when the vessel is 
proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. Normally, the 
Conventional Direction of Buoyage is the direction in which a vessel 
enters navigable channels from seaward and proceeds towards the head of 
navigation. In the absence of a route leading from seaward, the 
Conventional Direction of Buoyage generally follows a clockwise 
direction around land masses. For example, proceeding southerly along 
the Atlantic Coast, from Florida to Texas along the Gulf Coast, and 
northerly along the Pacific Coast are considered as proceeding in the 
Conventional Direction of Buoyage. In some instances, this direction 
must be arbitrarily assigned. Where doubt exists, the mariner should 
consult charts and other nautical publications.
    (f) Although aids to navigation are maintained to a reasonable 
degree of reliability, the rigors of the marine environment and various 
equipment failures do cause discrepancies on occasion.
    (g) The Coast Guard makes reasonable efforts to inform the navigator 
of known discrepancies, and to correct them within a reasonable period 
of time, depending upon resources available. Occasionally, a temporary 
aid to navigation, which provides different but similar service, is 
deployed until permanent repairs can be made to the original aid. 
Notification of such temporary changes is made through the notice to 
mariners system.
    (h) Until 1994, some private aids to navigation may display 
characteristics at variance with the U.S. Aids to Navigation System. 
Mariners should exercise caution when using private aids to navigation 
because private aids are

[[Page 145]]

often established to serve the needs of specific users rather than 
general navigation and their purpose may not be obvious to casual users; 
and, discrepancies to private aids are often detected, reported, and 
corrected less promptly than discrepancies to Coast Guard aids to 
navigation.

<R05>
Sec. 62.23  Beacons and buoys.

    (a) Aids to navigation are placed on shore or on marine sites to 
assist a navigator to determine his position or safe course. They may 
mark limits of navigable channels, or warn of dangers or obstructions to 
navigation. The primary components of the U.S. Aids to Navigation System 
are beacons and buoys.
    (b) Beacons are aids to navigation structures which are permanently 
fixed to the earth's surface. They range from large lighthouses to 
small, single-pile structures and may be located on land or in the 
water. Lighted beacons are called lights; unlighted beacons are called 
daybeacons.
    (1) Beacons exhibit a daymark. For small structures these are 
colored geometric shapes which make an aid to navigation readily visible 
and easily identifiable against background conditions. Generally, the 
daymark conveys to the mariner, during daylight hours, the same 
significance as does the aid's light or reflector at night. The daymark 
of large lighthouses and towers, however, consists of the structure 
itself. As a result, these daymarks do not infer lateral significance.
    (2) Vessels should not pass beacons close aboard due to the danger 
of collision with rip-rap or structure foundations, or the obstruction 
or danger that the aid marks.
    (c) Buoys are floating aids to navigation used extensively 
throughout U.S. waters. They are moored to the seabed by sinkers with 
chain or other moorings of various lengths.
    (1) The daymark of a buoy is the color and shape of the buoy and, if 
so equipped, of the topmark.
    (i) Can buoys have a cylindrical shape.
    (ii) Nun buoys have a tapered, conical shape.
    (iii) Pillar buoys have a wide cylindrical base supporting a 
narrower superstructure. They may be surmounted by colored shapes called 
topmarks.
    (iv) Spherical buoys have a round shape.
    (2) Mariners attempting to pass a buoy close aboard risk collision 
with a yawing buoy, the buoy's mooring, or with the obstruction which 
the buoy marks.
    (3) Mariners should not rely on buoys alone for determining their 
positions due to factors limiting their reliability. Prudent mariners 
will use bearings or angles from beacons or other landmarks, soundings, 
and various methods of electronic navigation. Buoys vary in reliability 
because:
    (i) Buoy positions represented on nautical charts are approximate 
positions only, due to practical limitations in positioning and 
maintaining buoys and their sinkers in precise geographical locations.
    (ii) Buoy moorings vary in length. The mooring lengths define a 
``watch circle'', and buoys can be expected to move within this circle. 
Actual watch circles do not coincide with the dots or circles 
representing them on charts.
    (iii) Buoy positions are normally verified during periodic 
maintenance visits. Between visits, environmental conditions, including 
atmospheric and sea conditions, and seabed slope and composition, may 
shift buoys off their charted positions. Also buoys may be dragged off 
station, sunk, or capsized by a collision with a vessel.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987; CGD 86-031, 52 FR 46351, Dec. 5, 
1987]


<R05>
Sec. 62.25  Lateral marks.

    (a) Lateral marks define the port and starboard sides of a route to 
be followed. They may be either beacons or buoys.
    (b) Sidemarks are lateral marks which advise the mariner to stay to 
one side of the mark. Their most frequent use is to mark the sides of 
channels; however, they may be used individually to mark obstructions 
outside of clearly defined channels. Sidemarks are not always placed 
directly on a channel edge and may be positioned

[[Page 146]]

outside the channel as indicated on charts and nautical publications.
    (1) Port hand marks indicate the left side of channels when 
proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. Beacons have green 
square daymarks, while buoys are green can or pillar buoys.
    (2) Starboard hand marks indicate the right side of channels when 
proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. Beacons have red 
triangular daymarks, while buoys are red nun or pillar buoys.
    (c) Preferred channel marks indicate channel junctions or 
bifurcations and may also mark wrecks or obstructions which the mariner, 
after consulting a chart to ascertain the location of the obstruction 
relative to the aid, may pass on either side. Preferred channel marks 
have red and green horizontal bands with the color of the topmost band 
indicating the preferred channel. If the topmost band is green, the mark 
serves as a port hand mark for vessels following the preferred channel 
proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage, and as a starboard 
hand mark for the other channel. Beacons would have square daymarks, 
while buoys would be can or pillar buoys. If the topmost band is red, 
the mark serves as a starboard hand mark for vessels following the 
preferred channel proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage, 
and a port hand mark for the other channel. Beacons would have 
triangular daymarks, while buoys would be nun or pillar buoys.
    (d) The above color schemes apply to IALA Region B. Marks located in 
the IALA Region A exhibit reversed color significance: port hand marks 
will be red when following the Conventional Direction of Buoyage, and 
starboard hand marks will be green. The meaning of daymark and buoy 
shapes is identical in both regions.
    (e) Certain marks on the Intracoastal Waterway may exhibit reversed 
lateral significance. See Sec. 62.49.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD 88-018, 54 FR 
48608, Nov. 24, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 62.27  Safe water marks.

    Safe water marks indicate that there is navigable water all around 
the mark. They are often used to indicate fairways or midchannels, or 
the seaward end of channels. Safe water marks are colored with red and 
white vertical stripes. Beacons have an octagonal daymark; red and white 
buoys are spherical or display a red spherical topmark.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD 88-018, 54 FR 
48608, Nov. 24, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 62.29  Isolated danger marks.

    Isolated danger marks indicate an isolated danger which may be 
passed on all sides. As these marks are erected or moored on or near 
dangers, they should not be approached closely without special caution. 
These marks are colored black with one or more broad horizontal red 
bands and are equipped with a topmark of two black spheres, one above 
the other.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD 88-018, 54 FR 
48608, Nov. 24, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 62.31  Special marks.

    Special marks are not primarily intended to assist safe navigation, 
but to indicate special areas or features referred to in charts or other 
nautical publications. They may be used, for example, to mark 
anchorages, cable or pipeline areas, traffic separation schemes, 
military exercise zones, ocean data acquisition systems, etc. Special 
marks are colored solid yellow.


<R05>
Sec. 62.32  Inland waters obstruction mark.

    (a) On inland waters designated by the Commandant as State waters in 
accordance with Sec. 66.05-5 of this chapter and on non-navigable 
internal waters of a State which have no defined head of navigation, a 
buoy showing alternate vertical black and white stripes may be used to 
indicate to a vessel operator that an obstruction to navigation extends 
from the nearest shore to the buoy.
    (b) The black and white buoy's meaning is ``do not pass between the 
buoy and the shore''. The number of white and black stripes is 
discretionary, provided that the white stripes are twice the width of 
the black stripes. Prior to December 31, 2003, this aid shall not be

[[Page 147]]

used on a waterway which has a red and white striped obstruction marker 
defined in Sec. 66.10-15(e)(3) of this chapter, unless all obstruction 
markers are replaced.

[CGD 97-018, 63 FR 33573, June 19, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 62.33  Information and regulatory marks.

    (a) Information and Regulatory Marks are used to alert the mariner 
to various warnings or regulatory matters. These marks have orange 
geometric shapes against a white background. The meanings associated 
with the orange shapes are as follows:
    (1) A vertical open-faced diamond signifies danger.
    (2) A vertical diamond shape having a cross centered within 
indicates that vessels are excluded from the marked area.
    (3) A circular shape indicates that certain operating restrictions 
are in effect within the marked area.
    (4) A square or rectangular shape will contain directions or 
instructions lettered within the shape.
    (b) When a buoy is used as an information or regulatory mark it 
shall be white with two horizontal orange bands placed completely around 
the buoy circumference. One band shall be near the top of the buoy body, 
with a second band placed just above the waterline of the buoy so that 
both bands are clearly visible.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD 97-018, 63 FR 
33573, June 19, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 62.35  Mooring buoys.

    Mooring Buoys are white with a blue horizontal band. This 
distinctive color scheme is recommended to facilitate identification and 
to avoid confusion with aids to navigation.


<R05>
Sec. 62.37  Lighthouses.

    Lighthouses are prominent beacons of varying size, color, and 
appearance employed to mark headlands, landfalls, harbor entrances, 
channel edges, hazards, and other features. While normally identified by 
their distinctive appearance, some lighthouses display diamond shaped, 
checkered daymarks to facilitate recognition.


<R05>
Sec. 62.39  Large navigational buoys.

    Large Navigational Buoys (LNB's) may be considered floating 
lighthouses. They generally provide light, sound, and radiobeacon 
signals, and some are equipped with radar beacons (racons). LNB's are 
red in color, have a forty foot diameter hull, and a tower approximately 
forty feet in height.


<R05>
Sec. 62.41  Ranges.

    Ranges are aids to navigation systems employing dual beacons which, 
when the structures appear to be in line, assist the mariner in 
maintaining a safe course. The appropriate nautical chart must be 
consulted when using ranges to determine whether the range marks the 
centerline of the navigable channel and also to ascertain what section 
of the range may be safety traversed. Ranges are generally, but not 
always, lighted, and display rectangular daymarks of various colors.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987; CGD 86-031, 52 FR 46351, Dec. 5, 
1987]


<R05>
Sec. 62.43  Numbers and letters.

    (a) All solid red and solid green aids are numbered, with red aids 
bearing even numbers and green aids bearing odd numbers. The numbers for 
each increase in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. Numbers are kept 
in approximately sequence on both sides of the channel by omitting 
numbers where necessary.
    (b) Only sidemarks are numbered. However, aids other than those 
mentioned above may be lettered to assist in their identification, or to 
indicate their purpose. Sidemarks may carry letters in addition to 
numbers to identify the first aid to navigation in a waterway, or when 
new aids to navigation are added to channels with previously completed 
numerical sequences. Letters on sidemarks will follow alphabetical order 
from seaward and proceeding toward the Conventional Direction of Buoyage 
and will be added to numbers as suffixes.
    (c) Aids to navigation may be fitted with light-reflecting material 
to increase their visibility in darkness. The colors of this material 
may convey the same significance as the aid except that letters and 
numbers may be white.

[[Page 148]]

    (d) Exceptions to the provisions of this section will be found on 
the Western Rivers System. See Sec. 62.51.
    (e) The guidelines for the display of numbers and letters on aids to 
navigation are identical for both Region A and Region B; red aids to 
navigation display even numbers, and green aids display odd numbers.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD 88-018, 54 FR 
48608, Nov. 24, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 62.45  Light characteristics.

    (a) Lights on aids to navigation are differentiated by color and 
rhythm. Lighthouses and range lights may display distinctive light 
characteristics to facilitate recognition. No special significance 
should be attached to the color or rhythm of such lights. Other lighted 
aids to navigation employ light characteristics to convey additional 
information.
    (b) When proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage, aids 
to navigation, if lighted, display light characteristics as follows:
    (1) Green lights mark port (left) sides of channels and locations of 
wrecks or obstructions which are to be passed by keeping these lights on 
the port (left) hand of a vessel. Green lights are also used on 
Preferred Channel Marks where the topmost band is green.
    (2) Red lights mark starboard (right) sides of channels and 
locations of wrecks or obstructions which are to be passed by keeping 
these lights on the starboard (right) hand of a vessel. Red lights are 
also used on Preferred Channel Marks where the topmost band is red.
    (3) Certain lights marking the Intracoastal Waterway may display 
reversed lateral significance. See Sec. 62.49.
    (c) Yellow lights have no lateral significance. Except on the 
Western Rivers, see Sec. 62.51, white lights have no lateral 
significance. The purpose of aids exhibiting white or yellow lights may 
be determined by their shape, color, letters or numbers, and the light 
rhythm employed.
    (d) Light rhythms, except as noted in Sec. 62.51 for the Western 
Rivers, are employed as follows:
    (1) Aids with lateral significance display regularly flashing or 
regularly occulting light rhythms. Ordinarily, flashing lights 
(frequency not exceeding 30 flashes per minute) will be used.
    (2) Preferred Channel Marks display a composite group flashing light 
rhythm (groups of two flashes followed by one flash).
    (3) Safe Water Marks display a white Morse Code ``A'' rhythm (short-
long flash).
    (4) Isolated Danger Marks display a white group flashing two.
    (5) Special Marks display yellow lights with fixed or slow flashing 
rhythm preferred.
    (6) Mooring Buoys and Information and Regulatory Marks display white 
lights of various rhythms.
    (7) For situations where lights require a distinct cautionary 
significance, as at sharp turns, sudden channel constrictions, wrecks, 
or obstructions, a quick flashing light rhythm (60 flashes per minute) 
may be used.
    (e) Occasionally lights use sectors to mark shoals or warn mariners 
of other dangers. Lights so equipped show one color from most directions 
and a different color or colors over definite arcs of the horizon as 
indicated on the appropriate nautical chart. These sectors provide 
approximate bearing information since the observer should note a change 
of color as the boundary between the sectors is crossed. As sector 
bearings are not precise, they should be considered a warning only and 
not used to determine exact bearing to the light.
    (f) Aids to navigation may be fitted with light-reflecting material 
to increase their visibility in darkness. Green or red reflective 
material is used only on marks which, if lighted, would exhibit a light 
of that color. Yellow reflective material is used on special marks and 
on Intracoastal Waterway marks. No significance is attached to white 
reflective material.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD 88-018, 54 FR 
48608, Nov. 24, 1989; CGD 97-018, 63 FR 33573, June 19, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 62.47  Sound signals.

    (a) Often sound signals are located on or adjacent to aids to 
navigation. When visual signals are obscured, sound signals warn 
mariners of the proximity of danger.

[[Page 149]]

    (1) Sound signals are distinguished by their tone and phase 
characteristics.
    (i) Tones are determined by the devices producing the sound (i.e., 
diaphones, diaphragm horns, reed horns, sirens, whistles, bells and 
gongs).
    (ii) Phase characteristics are defined by the signal's sound 
pattern, i.e., the number of blasts and silent periods per minute and 
their durations. Sound signals emanating from fixed structures generally 
produce a specific number of blasts and silent periods each minute when 
operating. Buoy sound signals are generally actuated by the motion of 
the sea and therefore do not emit a regular signal characteristic.
    (2) Where no live watch is maintained, sound signals are normally 
operated continuously. However, some are equipped with fog detectors 
which activate sound signals when visibility falls below a predetermined 
limit.
    (b) Mariners should not rely solely on sound signals to determine 
their positions for the following reasons:
    (1) Distance cannot be accurately determined by sound intensity.
    (2) Occasionally sound signals may not be heard in areas close to 
their location.
    (3) Signals may not sound in cases where fog exists close to, but 
not at, the location of the sound signal.
    (4) As buoy signals are generally activated by sea motion, they may 
produce no signals when seas are calm.
    (5) As previously noted, buoy positions are not always reliable. 
Therefore their sound signals cannot be assumed to be emanating from a 
fixed position.


<R05>
Sec. 62.49  Intracoastal Waterway identification.

    (a) In addition to the conventional signals, aids to navigation 
marking the Intracoastal Waterway exhibit unique yellow symbols to 
distinguish them from aids marking other waters.
    (1) Yellow triangles indicate that aids to navigation so marked 
should be passed keeping them on the starboard (right) hand of a vessel, 
regardless of the aid's number, color, or light color.
    (2) Yellow squares indicate that aids to navigation so marked should 
be passed keeping them on the port (left) hand of a vessel, regardless 
of the aid's number, color, or light color.
    (3) A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral information, but 
simply identifies aids to navigation as marking the Intracoastal 
Waterway.
    (b) The above guidelines apply for vessels traversing the 
Intracoastal Waterway in a southerly direction on the Atlantic Coast, in 
a westerly direction on the Okeechobee Waterway, or in a westerly 
direction along the Gulf Coast.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987; CGD 86-031, 52 FR 46351, Dec. 5, 
1987]


<R05>
Sec. 62.51  Western Rivers Marking System.

    (a) A variation of the standard U.S. aids to navigation system 
described above is employed on the Mississippi River and tributaries 
above Baton Rouge, LA and on certain other rivers which flow toward the 
Gulf of Mexico.
    (b) The Western Rivers System varies from the standard U.S. system 
as follows:
    (1) Buoys are not numbered.
    (2) Numbers on beacons do not have odd/even lateral significance 
but, rather, indicate mileage from a fixed point (normally the river 
mouth).
    (3) Diamond-shaped non-lateral dayboards, checkered red-and-white or 
green-and-white, similar to those used in the USATONS, as appropriate, 
are used as crossing dayboards where the river channel crosses from one 
bank to the other.
    (4) Lights on green buoys and on beacons with green daymarks show a 
single flash which may be green or white.
    (5) Lights on red buoys and on beacons with red daymarks show a 
double flash [Group Flashing (2)] which may be red or white.
    (6) Isolated danger marks are not used.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD-94-091, 61 FR 
27782, June 3, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 62.53  Racons.

    (a) Aids to navigation may be enhanced by the use of radar beacons 
(racons). Racons, when triggered by a radar signal, will transmit a 
coded reply to the interrogating radar. This reply serves to identify 
the aid station

[[Page 150]]

by exhibiting a series of dots and dashes which appear on the radar 
display in a line emanating radially from just beyond the echo of the 
aid station. Although racons may be used on both laterally significant 
and non-laterally significant aids alike, the racon signal itself is for 
identification purposes only, and therefore carries no lateral 
significance.
    (b) Racons are also used as bridge marks to mark the best point of 
passage.


<R05>
Sec. 62.54  Ownership identification.

    Ownership identification on private or state aids to navigation is 
permitted so long as it does not change or hinder an understanding of 
the meaning of the aid to navigation.

<R04>
                    Subpart C--Maritime Radiobeacons


<R05>
Sec. 62.55  General.

    Maritime radiobeacons operate during specific intervals as published 
in Coast Guard Light Lists. For station identification, simple 
characteristics consisting of combinations of dots and dashes are used. 
The characteristics of marker-beacons are composed of series of dashes 
for part of a 15 second cycle, which is followed by a silent period to 
complete the cycle. The transmitted power of maritime radiobeacons is 
adjusted to provide a useable signal at the service range which meets 
the operational requirement. Marker-beacons are of low power for local 
use only. Coast Guard maritime radiobeacons operate within the frequency 
band 275-335 kilohertz.


<R05>
Sec. 62.57  Carrier type operation.

    Radiobeacons superimpose the characteristic code on a carrier 
frequency which is on continuously during the period of 
transmission.This extends the usefulness of maritime radiobeacons to 
aircraft and ships employing automatic direction finders.


<R05>
Sec. 62.59  Calibration service.

    Special calibration radiobeacons, as listed in the current editions 
of the Coast Guard Light Lists, will broadcast continuously for the 
purpose of enabling vessels to calibrate their direction finders upon 
request either to the cognizant District Commander, or, if time does not 
permit, directly to the calibration station. Signals for requesting 
calibration service are described in the current editions of the Coast 
Guard Light Lists. In the case of sequenced radiobeacon stations, 
continuous transmission for calibration purposes cannot be made without 
interference resulting with other stations in the same frequency group.


<R05>
Sec. 62.61  Caution.

    (a) A vessel steering a course for a radiobeacon should observe the 
same precautions that apply when steering for a light or any other mark.
    (b) Distance cannot be accurately determined by radiobeacon signal. 
Mariners must exercise extreme caution when the aid to navigation which 
supports the radiobeacon is not visible, and no other means of 
determining its distance is available.
    (c) If the radiobeacon is aboard a Large Navigational Buoy (LNB) or 
on any marine site, particular care should be exercised to avoid the 
possibility of collision. In addition, caution should be exercised in 
using radiobeacons aboard floating aids, because of the possibility that 
the aid could be off station.


<R04>
    Subpart D--Public Participation in the Aids to Navigation System


<R05>
Sec. 62.63  Recommendations.

    (a) The public may recommend changes to existing aids to navigation, 
request new aids or the discontinuation of existing aids, and report 
aids no longer necessary for maritime safety. These recommendations 
should be sent to the appropriate District Commander.
    (b) Recommendations, requests and reports should be documented with 
as much information as possible to justify the proposed action. 
Desirable information includes:
    (1) Nature of the vessels which transit the area(s) in the question, 
including type, displacement, draft, and number of passengers and crew.

[[Page 151]]

    (2) Where practicable, the kinds of navigating devices used aboard 
such vessels (e.g, magnetic or gyro compasses, radio direction finders, 
radar, loran, and searchlights).
    (3) A chartlet or sketch describing the actual or proposed location 
of the aid(s), and a description of the action requested or recommended.


<R05>
Sec. 62.65  Procedure for reporting defects and discrepancies.

    (a) Mariners should notify the nearest Coast Guard facility 
immediately of any observed aids to navigation defects or discrepancies.
    (b) The Coast Guard cannot monitor the many thousands of aids in the 
U.S. Aids to Navigation System simultaneously and continuously. As a 
result, it is not possible to maintain every aid operating properly and 
on its charted position at all times. Marine safety will be enhanced if 
persons finding aids missing, sunk, capsized, damaged, off station, or 
showing characteristics other than those advertised in the Light List, 
or other publication, promptly inform the Coast Guard. When making the 
report to the Coast Guard the mariner should consult the Light List to 
ensure the correct geographical information is used due to the 
similarity of names and geographical areas.
    (c) Procedures for reporting defects and discrepancies:
    (1) Radio messages should be prefixed ``Coast Guard'' and 
transmitted directly to a Government shore radio station listed in 
Chapter four of Radio Navigation Aids Publication, 117, for relay to the 
relevant District Commander.
    (2) Commercial communications facilities should be used only when 
vessels are unable to contact a Government shore radio station. Charges 
for these messages will be accepted ``collect'' by the Coast Guard.

Sec. 66.05-5  Definitions.

    (a) The term State waters for private aids to navigation means those 
navigable waters of the United States which the Commandant, upon request 
of a State Administrator, has designated as waters within which a State 
government may regulate the establishment, operation, and maintenance of 
marine aids to navigation, including regulatory markers. The Commandant 
will entertain requests to make such designations with respect to 
navigable waters of the United States not marked by the Federal 
government. These designations when approved will be set forth in 
separate sections by States in this subpart and will briefly describe or 
identify waters so designated.
    (b) The term Uniform State Waterway Marking System (USWMS) means the 
system of private aids to navigation which may be operated in State 
waters. Subpart 66.10, which describes the USWMS, expires on December 
31, 2003.
    (c) The term State Administrator means the official of a State 
having power under the law of the State to regulate, establish, operate 
or maintain maritime aids to navigation on waters over which the State 
has jurisdiction.
    (d) The term State aids to navigation means all private marine aids 
to navigation operated in State waters for private aids to navigation, 
whether owned by a State, political subdivisions thereof or by 
individuals, corporations, or organizations.
    (e) The term regulate State maritime aids to navigation means to 
control the establishment, disestablishment, operation and maintenance 
of State aids to navigation.

Sec. 66.05-10  State waters for private aids to navigation; designations; revisions, and revocations.

    (a) A State Administrator who desires to regulate State maritime 
aids to navigation in the navigable waters of the United States not 
marked by the Federal Government, shall request the Commandant to 
designate the specific bodies of water involved as State waters for 
private aids to navigation.
    (b) The request shall be forwarded to the District Commander in 
whose district the bodies of water are located. The request shall give 
the name and description of the waterway; the extent of use being made 
of the waterway for marine navigation, in general terms; an appropriate 
chart or sketch of the area; and a general outline of the nature and 
extent of the State aids to navigation which the Administrator plans to 
establish in the waterway.
    (c) The District Commander shall review the request and consult with 
the State Administrator concerning the terms of an initial agreement to 
be entered into under provisions of Sec. 66.05-20. When they have 
arrived at terms of an agreement satisfactory to both, the District 
Commander shall forward the request to the Commandant with his 
recommendations and the terms of agreement mutually settled upon. If 
they cannot reach such agreement, the District Commander shall forward 
the request with his recommendations and a statement of the points 
agreed upon and the points remaining at issue.
    (d) Upon receipt of the request, the Commandant will determine 
whether or not approval of the request is in the public interest and 
will inform the State Administrator and the District Commander of the 
Coast Guard's decision. If the request is approved, the designation by 
the Commandant of the

waters in question as State waters for private aids to navigation will 
be also defined and described in this subpart.
    (e) The Commandant may, upon his own initiative or upon request, 
revoke or revise any designations of State waters for private aids to 
navigation previously made by him. Written notice shall be given the 
State Administrator of the action contemplated by the Commandant. The 
State Administrator will be afforded a period of not less than 30 days 
from the date of the notice in which to inform the Commandant of the 
State's views in the matter before final action is completed to revoke 
or revise such designation.

Sec. 66.05-20  Coast Guard-State agreements.

    (a) The District Commander in whose District a waterway is located 
may enter into agreements with State Administrators permitting a State 
to regulate aids to navigation, including regulatory markers, in State 
waters for private aids to navigation, as, in the opinion of the 
District Commander, the State is able to do in a manner to improve the 
safety of navigation. When a waterway is located within the area of 
jurisdiction of more than one Coast Guard District, the District 
Commander in whose District the State capital is located shall execute 
the agreement in behalf of the Coast Guard. All such agreements shall 
reserve to the District Commander the right to inspect the State aids to 
navigation without prior notice to the State. They shall stipulate that 
State aids to navigation will conform to the Uniform State Waterway 
marking System or to the U.S. Aids to Navigation System and that the 
State Administrator will modify or remove State aids to navigation 
without expense to the United States when so directed by the District 
Commander, subject to the right of appeal on the part of the State 
Administrator to the Commandant.
    (b) A Coast Guard-State agreement shall become effective when both 
parties have signed the agreements. In lieu of the procedure prescribed 
in Sec. 66.01-5, the agreement shall constitute blanket approval by the 
Commandant, of the State aids to navigation, including regulatory 
markers, established or to be established in State waters for private 
aids to navigation designated or to be designated by the Commandant.
    (c) In addition to the matters set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section, Coast Guard-State agreements shall cover the following points, 
together with such other matters as the parties find it desirable to 
include:
    (1) A description, in sufficient detail for publication in Notices 
to Mariners, of all aids to navigations under State jurisdiction in 
navigable waters of the United States in existence prior to the 
effective date of the agreement which have not been previously approved 
under procedures of Sec. 66.01-5.
    (2) Procedures for use by the State administrator to notify the 
District Commander of changes made in State aids to navigation, as 
required by Sec. 66.05-25.
    (3) If prior to December 21, 2003, specification of the marking 
system to be used, whether the U.S. Aids to Navigation System or the 
Uniform State Waterway Marking System.
    (4) Specification of standards as to minimum size and shape of 
markers, the use of identifying letters, the use of reflectors or 
retroreflective materials, and any other similar standards so as to 
enable Coast Guard inspectors to determine compliance with Statewide 
standards.

    (a) Until December 31, 2003, the Uniform State Waterway Marking 
System's (USWMS) aids to navigation provisions for marking channels and 
obstructions may be used in those navigable waters of the U.S. that have 
been designated as state waters for private aids to navigation and in 
those internal waters that are non-navigable waters of the U.S. All 
other provisions for the use of regulatory markers and other aids to 
navigation shall be in accordance with United States Aid to Navigation

Sec. 66.10-10  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 66.10-15  Aids to navigation.

    (a) USWMS aids to navigation may have lateral or cardinal meaning.
    (b) On a well defined channel including a river or other relatively 
narrow natural or improved waterway, an aid to navigation shall normally 
be a solid colored buoy. A buoy which marks the left side of the channel 
viewed looking upstream or toward the head of navigation shall be 
colored all black. A buoy which marks the right side of the channel 
viewed looking upstream or toward the head of a navigation shall be 
colored all red. On a well defined channel, solid colored buoys shall be 
established in pairs, one on each side of the navigable channel which 
they mark, and opposite each other to inform the user that the channel 
lies between the buoys and that he should pass between the buoys.
    (c) On an irregularly defined channel, solid colored buoys may be 
used singly in staggered fashion on alternate sides of the channel 
provided they are spaced at sufficiently close intervals to inform the 
user that the channel lies between the buoys and that he should pass 
between the buoys.
    (d) Where there is no well-defined channel or when a body of water 
is obstructed by objects whose nature or location is such that the 
obstruction can be approached by a vessel from more than one direction, 
supplemental aids to navigation having cardinal meaning (i.e., 
pertaining to the cardinal points of the compass, north, east, south, 
and west) may be used. The use of an aid to navigation having cardinal 
meaning is discretionary provided that the use of such a marker is 
limited to wholly State owned waters and the State waters for private 
aids to navigation as defined and described in this part.
    (e) Aids to navigation conforming to the cardinal system shall 
consist of three distinctly colored buoys.
    (1) A white buoy with a red top may be used to indicate to a vessel 
operator that he must pass to the south or west of the buoy.
    (2) A white buoy with a black top may be used to indicate to a 
vessel operator that he must pass to the north or east of the buoy.
    (3) In addition, a buoy showing alternate vertical red and white 
stripes may be used to indicate to a vessel operator that an obstruction 
to navigation extends from the nearest shore to the buoy and that he 
must not pass between the buoy and shore. The number of white and red 
stripes is discretionary, provided that the white stripes are twice the 
width of the red stripes.

    A red light shall only be used on a solid colored red buoy. A green 
light shall only be used on a solid colored black or a solid colored 
green buoy. White lights shall be used for all other buoys. When a light 
is used on a cardinal system buoy or a vertically striped white and red 
buoy, it shall always be quick flashing.

    (b) Line of demarcation. There is no line of demarcation prescribed 
for this District. When required, it will be determined in accordance 
with Sec. 67.01-20. The District Commander shall assign structures to 
classes as he deems appropriate at the time of application for a permit 
to establish and operate lights and fog signals. In so doing, he shall 
take into consideration matters concerning, but not necessarily limited 
to, the dimensions of the structure and the depth of water in which it 
is located; the proximity of the structure to vessel routes; the nature 
and amount of vessel traffic; and the effect of background lighting.

Sec. 67.50-25  Eighth Coast Guard District.

    (a) Description. See Sec. 3.40-1 of this chapter.
    (b) Lines of demarcation. The two lines of demarcation described in 
this section are for administrative purposes to distinguish between the 
areas in which structures shall be subject to Class ``A'', ``B'' or 
``C'' requirements. The primary line of demarcation delimits the areas 
to the seaward of which Class ``A'' requirements are imposed. The 
secondary line of demarcation delimits the areas to the shoreward of 
which Class ``C'' requirements are imposed. In those areas where no 
secondary line of demarcation is prescribed, the structures shoreward of 
the primary line of demarcation are considered to be Class ``C'' 
structures. Class ``B'' requirements are imposed on the structures in 
the areas between the two lines of demarcation.
    (1) The coordinates of the primary line of demarcation within the 
jurisdiction of the District Commander are as follows:

    (c) Seismographic and surveying operations. (1) All stakes and 
casings (pipes), except bamboo poles and wooden stakes less than 2 
inches in diameter, placed in the water during seismographic or 
surveying operations shall be marked with flags during the daylight 
hours. Those casings remaining in place during the hours of darkness 
shall be marked by a red light as prescribed in Subpart 67.30 of this 
part.
    (2) All buoys used during seismographic operations shall be painted 
with international orange and white horizontal bands. The buoys shall be 
of light construction in order that they will not present a hazard to 
marine commerce.
    (d) Spoil marking. (1) All submerged spoil resulting from the 
dredging of channels, laying of pipelines, or any other operation, which 
constitutes an obstruction to navigation, shall be properly marked. The 
spoil banks should be examined at frequent intervals in order that the 
changing conditions may be kept under control. As markers are no longer 
required due to settling of banks, the Coast Guard will authorize their 
removal upon application.
    (2) All openings in such submerged spoil shall be marked by 
daybeacons on each side of the openings. When spoil is located on each 
side of a channel or pipe line, each bank will be considered separately. 
The daybeacons shall be equipped with arrows designating the safe water 
through the opening. These daybeacons may also be used as channel 
markers for the dredged channels providing they are also equipped with 
arrows designating the spoil bank openings.
    (3) When spoil banks constituting an obstruction to navigation abut 
an established traveled waterway, the outboard spoil bank markers shall 
be equipped with quick flashing lights described in Subpart 67.30 of 
this part, except that the color shall be in accordance with the 
provisions of Subpart 62.25 of Part 62 of this subchapter.
    (e) Applications. All private aids to navigation applications and 
all correspondence dealing with private aids to navigation and 
obstruction lighting shall be addressed to Commander, Eighth Coast Guard 
District, Hale Boggs Federal Building, 500 Camp Street, New Orleans, 
Louisiana, 70130-3396 marked for the attention of the Chief, Aids to 
Navigation Section.
    (f) Enclosures. Applicants shall append on a separate sheet with 
each application, the description, including manufacturer, of 
obstruction lights and fog signals.
    (g) Corps of Engineers correspondence. A copy of all correspondence 
directed to the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, in 
accordance with condition (i) of the Department of the Army permit, 
shall be forwarded to the District Commander for those operations 
conducted under permits authorizing the erection of structures in areas 
in which Class ``A'', Class ``B'', or Class ``C'' requirements must be 
met.

              SUBCHAPTER D--INTERNATIONAL NAVIGATION RULES

<R05>

    Special Note: Application of the 72 COLREGS to territories and 
possessions.
    a. Article III of the Convention on the International Regulations 
for Preventing Collisons at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), done at London, 
October 20, 1972, as rectified by Proces-Verbal of December 1, 1973, 
provides that a party may notify the Secretary-General of the 
International Maritime Organization (IMO, formerly Inter-Governmental 
Maritime Consultative Organization or IMCO) that it extends the 
application of the Convention to territory for which it is responsible 
for international relations. Since it is the intention of the United 
States that the 72 COLREGS apply to all U.S. territories and possessions 
to the same extent that the International Regulations for Preventing 
Collisions at Sea, 1960 (60 COLREGS) (16 USC 794, TIAS 5813) previously 
applied, the United States has given notice to the Secretary-General 
that the provisions of the 1972 COLREGS are applicable on July 15, 1977, 
to the following territories and possessions for which the United States 
is responsible for international relations:

Puerto Rico
Guam
The Canal Zone
The Virgin Islands of the United States
American Samoa
Midway Island
Wake Island
Johnston Island
Palmyra Island
Kingman Reef
Howland Island
Baker Island
Jarvis Island
Navassa Island

    b. In accordance with Article III, other parties to the Convention 
have notified the Secretary-General that application of 72 COLREGS is 
extended. These parties with their territorial extensions are listed in 
Table 1.

     Table 1. Territorial Extensions of Other Parties to 72 COLREGS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                               Territories to which 72
            Party to convention                 COLREGS are extended
------------------------------------------------------------------------
United Kingdom............................  Hong Kong.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Because earlier formulations of the COLREGS were not elaborated as 
treaties, they came into force by the almost simultaneous enactment of 
domestic legislation by the majority of maritime nations. The COLREGS 
were judicially considered as being customary international law, that is 
to say international law based upon the consensus of maritime nations 
rather than upon an express instrument. Because 72 COLREGS was 
elaborated as a treaty, and under usual treaty practice only parties are 
bound, there may be a period of time after the 72 COLREGS come into 
force during which the ships of a nation not party to 72 COLREGS might 
not be considered as being bound to comply with the convention. While it 
is most likely that the 72 COLREGS will rapidly achieve the status of 
customary international law, thereby obviating any concern on the part 
of the mariner as to whether a particular nation is a party, it does not 
necessarily follow that the courts in all nations will apply 72 COLREGS 
to the vessels of a non-party nation. In the absence of changes in their 
domestic law there may be certain nations that will feel compelled to 
continue 60 COLREGS in force, despite the coming into force of 72 
COLREGS.
    The following nations are Contracting Parties for which 72 COLREGS 
will apply upon the Convention's entry into force:

Algeria
Bahamas
Belgium
Brazil
Bulgaria
Canada
Denmark
Finland
France
German Democratic Republic
Germany, Federal Republic
Ghana
Greece
Hungary
Iceland
India
Liberia
Mexico
Monaco
Netherlands
New Zealand
Nigeria
Norway
Papua New Guinea
Poland
Romania
South Africa
Spain
Sweden
Switzerland
Syrian Arab Republic
USSR
United Kingdom
United States
Yugloslavia
Zaire

    The following nations have accepted the 60 COLREGS but are not 
Contracting Parties to 72 COLREGS:
Argentina
Australia
Austria
Barbados
Burma
China
Cuba
Cyprus
Czechoslovakia
Ecuador
Egypt

<R05>
Sec. 81.1  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    72 COLREGS refers to the International Regulations for Preventing 
Collisions at Sea, 1972, done at London, October 20, 1972, as rectified 
by the Proces-Verbal of December 1, 1973, as amended.
    A vessel of special construction or purpose means a vessel designed 
or modified to perform a special function and whose arrangement is 
thereby made relatively inflexible.
    Interference with the special function of the vessel occurs when 
installation or use of lights, shapes, or sound-signaling appliances 
under 72 COLREGS prevents or significantly hinders the operation in 
which the vessel is usually engaged.

[CGD 77-136, 47 FR 13799, Apr. 1, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 81.3  General.

    Vessels of special construction or purpose which cannot fully comply 
with the light, shape, and sound signal provisions of 72 COLREGS without 
interfering with their special function may instead meet alternative 
requirements. The Chief of the Marine Safety Division in each Coast 
Guard District Office makes this determination and requires that 
alternative compliance be as close as possible with the 72 COLREGS. 
These regulations set out the procedure by which a vessel may be 
certified for alternative compliance. The information collection and 
recordkeeping requirements in Secs. 81.5 and 81.18 have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control No. 2115-0073.

Certificate of Alternative Compliance is sought;
    (ii) A description of the special function of the vessel that would 
be interfered with by full compliance with the provision of that Rule or 
Annex section; and
    (iii) A statement of how full compliance would interfere with the 
special function of the vessel.
    (6) A description of the alternative installation that is in closest 
possible compliance with the applicable 72 COLREGS Rule or Annex 
section.
    (7) A copy of the vessel's plans or an accurate scale drawing that 
clearly shows:

Sec. 81.9  Certificate of Alternative Compliance: Contents.

    The Chief of the Marine Safety Division issues the Certificate of 
Alternative Compliance to the vessel based on a determination that it 
cannot comply fully with 72 COLREGS light, shape, and sound signal 
provisions without interference with its special function. This 
Certificate includes--
    (a) Identification of the vessel as supplied in the application 
under Sec. 81.5(a)(2);

Sec. 82.3  Pushing vessel and vessel being pushed: Composite unit.

    Rule 24(b) of the 72 COLREGS states that when a pushing vessel and a 
vessel being pushed ahead are rigidly connected in a composite unit, 
they are regarded as a power-driven vessel and must exhibit the lights 
under Rule 23. A ``composite unit'' is interpreted to be a pushing 
vessel that is rigidly connected by mechanical means to a vessel being 
pushed so they react to sea and swell as one vessel. ``Mechanical 
means'' does not include the following:
    (a) Lines.
    (b) Hawsers.
    (c) Wires.
    (d) Chains.

Sec. 84.01  Definitions.

    (a) The term height above the hull means height above the uppermost 
continuous deck. This height shall be measured from the position 
vertically beneath the location of the light.
    (b) High-speed craft means a craft capable of maximum speed in 
meters per second (m/s) equal to or exceeding: 3.7<inv-triang> 
<SUP>0.1667</SUP>; where <inv-triang> = displacement corresponding to 
the design waterline (meters <INF>3</INF>).

    Note to paragraph (b): The same formula expressed in pounds and 
knots is maximum speed in knots (kts) equal to exceeding 1.98 (lbs) 
<inv-triang> <SUP>0.1667</SUP>; where <inv-triang> = displacement 
corresponding to design waterline in pounds.
    (c) The term practical cut-off means, for vessels 20 meters or more 
in length, 12.5 percent of the minimum luminous intensity (Table 
84.15(b)) corresponding to the greatest range of visibility for which 
the requirements of Annex I are met.
    (d) The term Rule or Rules means the Inland Navigation Rules 
contained in sec. 2 of the Inland Navigational Rules Act of 1980 (Pub. 
L. 96-591, 94 Stat. 3415, 33 U.S.C. 2001, December 24, 1980) as amended.

[CGD 81-008, 46 FR 62447, Dec. 24, 1981, as amended by CGD 94-011, 63 FR 
5731, Feb. 4, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 84.03  Vertical positioning and spacing of lights.

    (a) On a power-driven vessel of 20 meters or more in length the 
masthead lights shall be placed as follows:
    (1) The forward masthead light, or if only one masthead light is 
carried, then that light, at a height above the hull of not less than 5 
meters, and, if the breadth of the vessel exceeds 5 meters, then at a 
height above the hull not less than such breadth, so however that the 
light need not be placed at a greater height above the hull than 8 
meters;
    (2) When two masthead lights are carried the after one shall be at 
least 2 meters vertically higher than the forward one.
    (b) The vertical separation of the masthead lights of power-driven 
vessels shall be such that in all normal conditions of trim the after 
light will be seen over and separate from the forward light at a 
distance of 1000 meters from the stem when viewed from water level.
    (c) The masthead light of a power-driven vessel of 12 meters but 
less than 20 meters in length shall be placed at a height above the 
gunwale of not less than 2.5 meters.
    (d) The masthead light, or the all-round light described in Rule 
23(c), of a power-driven vessel of less than 12 meters in length shall 
be carried at least one meter higher than the sidelights.
    (e) One of the two or three masthead lights prescribed for a power-
driven vessel when engaged in towing or pushing another vessel shall be 
placed in the same position as either the forward masthead light or the 
after masthead light, provided that the lowest after masthead light 
shall be at least 2 meters vertically higher than the highest forward 
masthead light.
    (f)(1) The masthead light or lights prescribed in Rule 23(a) shall 
be so placed as to be above and clear of all

[[Page 212]]

other lights and obstructions except as described in paragraph (f)(2) of 
this section.
    (2) When it is impracticable to carry the all-round lights 
prescribed in Rule 27(b)(i) below the masthead lights, they may be 
carried above the after masthead light(s) or vertically in between the 
forward masthead light(s) and after masthead light(s), provided that in 
the latter case the requirement of Sec. 84.05(d) shall be complied with.
    (g) The sidelights of a power-driven vessel shall be placed at least 
one meter lower than the forward masthead light. They shall not be so 
low as to be interfered with by deck lights.
    (h) [Reserved]
    (i) When the Rules prescribe two or three lights to be carried in a 
vertical line, they shall be spaced as follows:
    (1) On a vessel of 20 meters in length or more such lights shall be 
spaced not less than 1 meter apart, and the lowest of these lights 
shall, except where a towing light is required, be placed at a height of 
not less than 4 meters above the hull;
    (2) On a vessel of less than 20 meters in length such lights shall 
be spaced not less than 1 meter apart and the lowest of these lights 
shall, except where a towing light is required, be placed at a height of 
not less than 2 meters above the gunwale;
    (3) When three lights are carried they shall be equally spaced.
    (j) The lower of the two all-round lights prescribed for a vessel 
when engaged in fishing shall be a height above the sidelights not less 
than twice the distance between the two vertical lights.
    (k) The forward anchor light prescribed in Rule 30(a)(i), when two 
are carried, shall not be less than 4.5 meters above the after one. On a 
vessel of 50 meters or more in length this forward anchor light shall be 
placed at a height or not less than 6 meters above the hull.

3947, Feb. 6, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 84.05  Horizontal positioning and spacing of lights.

    (a) Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, when two 
masthead lights are prescribed for a power-driven vessel, the horizontal 
distance between them must not be less than one quarter of the length of 
the vessel but need not be more than 50 meters. The forward light must 
be placed not more than one half of the length of the vessel from the 
stem.
    (b) On a power-driven vessel of 20 meters or more in length the 
sidelights shall not be placed in front of the forward masthead lights. 
They shall be placed at or near the side of the vessel.
    (c) When the lights prescribed in Rule 27(b)(i) are placed 
vertically between the forward masthead light(s) and the after masthead 
light(s) these all-round lights shall be placed at a horizontal distance 
of not less than 2 meters from the fore and aft centerline of the vessel 
in the athwartship direction.
    (d) When only one masthead light is prescribed for a power-driven 
vessel, this light must be exhibited forward of amidships. For a vessel 
of less than 20 meters in length, the vessel shall exhibit one masthead 
light as far forward as is practicable.
    (e) On power-driven vessels 50 meters but less than 60 meters in 
length operated on the Western Rivers, and those waters specified in 
Sec. 89.25, the horizontal distance between masthead lights shall not be 
less than 10 meters.

[CGD 81-008, 46 FR 62447, Dec. 24, 1981, as amended by CGD 88-07, 53 FR 
10533, April 1, 1988; CGD 94-011, 63 FR 5731, Feb. 4, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 84.07  Details of location of direction-indicating lights for fishing vessels, dredgers and vessels engaged in underwater operations.

    (a) The light indicating the direction of the outlying gear from a 
vessel engaged in fishing as prescribed in Rule 26(c)(ii) shall be 
placed at a horizontal distance of not less than 2 meters and not more 
than 6 meters away from the two all-round red and white lights. This 
light shall be placed not higher than the all-round white light 
prescribed in Rule 26(c)(i) and not lower than the sidelights.
    (b) The lights and shapes on a vessel engaged in dredging or 
underwater operations to indicate the obstructed side and/or the side on 
which it is safe to pass, as prescribed in Rule 27(d)(i) and (ii), shall 
be placed at the maximum

[[Page 213]]

practical horizontal distance, but in no case less than 2 meters, from 
the lights or shapes prescribed in Rule 27(b)(i) and (ii). In no case 
shall the upper of these lights or shapes be at a greater height than 
the lower of the three lights or shapes prescribed in Rule 27(b)(i) and 
(ii).


<R05>
Sec. 84.09  Screens.

    (a) The sidelights of vessels of 20 meters or more in length shall 
be fitted with mat black inboard screens and meet the requirements of 
Sec. 84.17. On vessels of less than 20 meters in length, the sidelights, 
if necessary to meet the requirements of Sec. 84.17, shall be fitted 
with mat black inboard screens. With a combined lantern, using a single 
vertical filament and a very narrow division between the green and red 
sections, external screens need not be fitted.
    (b) On power-driven vessels less than 12 meters in length 
constructed after July 31, 1983, the masthead light, or the all-round 
light described in Rule 23(c) shall be screened to prevent direct 
illumination of the vessel forward of the operator's position.


<R05>
Sec. 84.11  Shapes.

    (a) Shapes shall be black and of the following sizes:
    (1) A ball shall have a diameter of not less than 0.6 meter;
    (2) A cone shall have a base diameter of not less than 0.6 meter and 
a height equal to its diameter;
    (3) A diamond shape shall consist of two cones (as defined in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section) having a common base.
    (b) The vertical distance between shapes shall be at least 1.5 
meter.
    (c) In a vessel of less than 20 meters in length shapes of lesser 
dimensions but commensurate with the size of the vessel may be used and 
the distance apart may be correspondingly reduced.


<R05>
Sec. 84.13  Color specification of lights.

    (a) The chromaticity of all navigation lights shall conform to the 
following standards, which lie within the boundaries of the area of the 
diagram specified for each color by the International Commission on 
Illumination (CIE), in the ``Colors of Light Signals'', which is 
incorporated by reference. It is Publication CIE No. 2.2. (TC-1.6), 
1975, and is available from the Illumination Engineering Society, 345 
East 47th Street, New York, NY 10017. It is also available for 
inspection at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol 
Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. This incorporation by reference 
was approved by the Director of the Federal Register.
    (b) The boundaries of the area for each color are given by 
indicating the corner co-ordinates, which are as follows:
    (1) White:

x 0.525  0.525  0.452  0.310  0.310  0.443
y 0.382  0.440  0.440  0.348  0.283  0.382

    (2) Green:

y 0.385  0.723  0.511  0.356

    (3) Red:

x 0.680  0.660  0.735  0.721
y 0.320  0.320  0.265  0.259

    (4) Yellow:

x 0.612  0.618  0.575  0.575
y 0.382  0.382  0.425  0.406


<R05>
Sec. 84.15  Intensity of lights.

    (a) The minimum luminous intensity of lights shall be calculated by 
using the formula:

I=3.43 x 10<SUP>6</SUP> x T x D<SUP>2</SUP> x K<SUP>-D

</SUP>where I is luminous intensity in candelas under service 
conditions,
T is threshold factor 2 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> lux,
    D is range of visibility (luminous range) of the light in nautical 
miles,
    K is atmospheric transmissivity. For prescribed lights the value of 
K shall be 0.8, corresponding to a meteorological visibility of 
approximately 13 nautical miles.

    (b) A selection of figures derived from the formula is given in 
Table 84.15(b):

Sec. 84.17  Horizontal sectors.

    (a)(1) In the forward direction, sidelights as fitted on the vessel 
shall show the minimum required intensities. The intensities shall 
decrease to reach practical cut-off between 1 and 3 degrees outside the 
prescribed sectors.
    (2) For sternlights and masthead lights and at 22.5 degrees abaft 
the beam for sidelights, the minimum required intensities shall be 
maintained over the arc of the horizon up to 5 degrees within the limits 
of the sectors prescribed in Rule 21. From 5 degrees within the 
prescribed sectors the intensity may decrease by 50 percent up to the 
prescribed limits; it shall decrease steadily to reach practical cut-off 
at not more than 5 degrees outside the prescribed sectors.
    (b) All-round lights shall be so located as not to be obscured by 
masts, topmasts or structures within angular sectors of more than 6 
degrees, except anchor lights prescribed in Rule 30, which need not be 
placed at an impracticable height above the hull, and the all-round 
white light described in Rule 23(d), which may not be obscured at all.
    (c) If it is impracticable to comply with paragraph (b) of this 
section by exhibiting only one all-round light, two all-round lights 
shall be used suitably positioned or screened to appear, as far as 
practicable, as one light at a minimum distance of one nautical mile.

    Note to paragraph (c): Tow unscreened all-round lights that are 1.28 
meters apart or less will appear as one light to the naked eye at a 
distance of one nautical mile.

Sec. 84.19  Vertical sectors.

    (a) The vertical sectors of electric lights as fitted, with the 
exception of lights on sailing vessels underway and on unmanned barges, 
shall ensure that:
    (1) At least the required minimum intensity is maintained at all 
angles from 5 degrees above to 5 degrees below the horizontal;
    (2) At least 60 percent of the required minimum intensity is 
maintained from 7.5 degrees above to 7.5 degrees below the horizontal.
    (b) In the case of sailing vessels underway the vertical sectors of 
electric lights as fitted shall ensure that:
    (1) At least the required minimum intensity is maintained at all 
angles from 5 degrees above to 5 degrees below the horizontal;
    (2) At least 50 percent of the required minimum intensity is 
maintained from 25 degrees above to 25 degrees below the horizontal.
    (c) In the case of unmanned barges the minimum required intensity of 
electric lights as fitted shall be maintained on the horizontal.
    (d) In the case of lights other than electric lights these 
specifications shall be met as closely as possible

<R05>
Sec. 84.23  Maneuvering light.

    Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 84.03(f), the maneuvering 
light described in Rule 34(b) shall be placed approximately in the same 
fore and aft vertical plane as the masthead light or lights and, where 
practicable, at a minimum height of one-half meter vertically above the 
forward masthead light, provided that it shall be carried not less than 
one-half meter vertically above or below the after masthead light. On a 
vessel where only one masthead light is carried the maneuvering light, 
if fitted, shall be carried where it can best be seen, not less than 
one-half meter vertically apart from the masthead light.

Sec. 84.24  High-speed craft.

    (a) The masthead light of high-speed craft with a length to breadth 
ratio of less than 3.0 may be placed at a height related to the breadth 
lower than that prescribed in Sec. 84.03(a)(1), provided that the base 
angle of the isosceles triangle formed by the side lights and masthead 
light when seen in end elevation is not less than 27 degrees as 
determined by the formula in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) The minimum height of masthead light above sidelights is to be 
determined by the following formula: Tan 27 deg.=<INF>X</INF>/
<INF>Y</INF>; where Y is the horizontal distance between the sidelights 
and X is the height of the forward masthead light.

<R05>
Sec. 86.01  Frequencies and range of audibility.

    The fundamental frequency of the signal shall lie within the range 
70-525 Hz. The range of audibility of the signal from a whistle shall be 
determined by those frequencies, which may include the fundamental and/
or one or more higher frequencies, which lie within the frequency ranges 
and provide the sound pressure levels specified in Sec. 86.05.


<R05>
Sec. 86.03  Limits of fundamental frequencies.

    To ensure a wide variety of whistle characteristics, the fundamental 
frequency of a whistle shall be between the following limits:
    (a) 70-200 Hz, for a vessel 200 meters or more in length;
    (b) 130-350 Hz, for a vessel 75 meters but less than 200 meters in 
length;
    (c) 250-525 Hz, for a vessel less than 75 meters in length.


<R05>
Sec. 86.05  Sound signal intensity and range of audibility.

    A whistle on a vessel shall provide, in the direction of the forward 
axis of the whistle and at a distance of 1 meter from it, a sound 
pressure level in at least one \1/3\-octave band of not less than the 
appropriate figure given in Table 86.05 within the following frequency 
ranges (<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 percent):
    (a) 130-1200 Hz, for a vessel 75 meters or more in length;
    (b) 250-1600 Hz, for a vessel 20 meters but less than 75 meters in

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Note. The range of audibility in the table above is for information and is approximately the range at which a
  whistle may usually be heard on its forward axis in conditions of still air on board a vessel having average
  background noise level at the listening posts (taken to be 68 dB in the octave band centered on 250 Hz and 63
  dB in the octave band centered on 500 Hz).
In practice the range at which a whistle may be heard is extremely variable and depends critically on weather
  conditions; the values given can be regarded as typical but under conditions of strong wind or high ambient
  noise level at the listening post the range may be much reduced.


<R05>
Sec. 86.07  Directional properties.

    The sound pressure level of a directional whistle shall be not more 
than 4 dB below the sound pressure level specified in Sec. 86.05 in any 
direction in the horizontal plane within <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>45 degrees 
of the forward axis. The sound pressure level of the whistle in any 
other direction in the horizontal plane shall not be more than 10 dB 
less than the sound pressure level specified for the forward axis, so 
that the range of audibility in any direction will be at least half the 
range required on the forward axis. The sound pressure level shall be 
measured in that one-third octave band which determines the audibility 
range.


<R05>
Sec. 86.09  Positioning of whistles.

    (a) When a directional whistle is to be used as the only whistle on 
the vessel and is permanently installed, it shall be installed with its 
forward axis directed forward.

[[Page 217]]

    (b) A whistle shall be placed as high as practicable on a vessel, in 
order to reduce interception of the emitted sound by obstructions and 
also to minimize hearing damage risk to personnel. The sound pressure 
level of the vessel's own signal at listening posts shall not exceed 110 
dB(A) and so far as practicable should not exceed 100 dB(A).


<R05>
Sec. 86.11  Fitting of more than one whistle.

    If whistles are fitted at a distance apart of more than 100 meters, 
they shall not be sounded simultaneously.


<R05>
Sec. 86.13  Combined whistle systems.

    (a) A combined whistle system is a number of whistles (sound 
emitting sources) operated together. For the purposes of the Rules a 
combined whistle system is to be regarded as a single whistle.
    (b) The whistles of a combined system shall:
    (1) Be located at a distance apart of not more than 100 meters,
    (2) Be sounded simultaneously,
    (3) Each have a fundamental frequency different from those of the 
others by at least 10 Hz, and
    (4) Have a tonal characteristic appropriate for the length of vessel 
which shall be evidenced by at least two-thirds of the whistles in the 
combined system having fundamental frequencies falling within the limits 
prescribed in Sec. 86.03, or if there are only two whistles in the 
combined system, by the higher fundamental frequency falling within the 
limits prescribed in Sec. 86.03.
    Note: If due to the presence of obstructions the sound field of a 
single whistle or of one of the whistles referred to in Sec. 86.11 is 
likely to have a zone of greatly reduced signal level, a combined 
whistle system should be fitted so as to overcome this reduction.


<R05>
Sec. 86.15  Towing vessel whistles.

    A power-driven vessel normally engaged in pushing ahead or towing 
alongside may, at all times, use a whistle whose characteristic falls 
within the limits prescribed by Sec. 86.03 for the longest customary 
composite length of the vessel and its tow.


<R04>
                         Subpart B--Bell or Gong


<R05>
Sec. 86.21  Intensity of signal.

    A bell or gong, or other device having similar sound characteristics 
shall produce a sound pressure level of not less than 110 dB at 1 meter.


<R05>
Sec. 86.23  Construction.

    Bells and gongs shall be made of corrosion-resistant material and 
designed to give a clear tone. The diameter of the mouth of the bell 
shall be not less than 300 mm for vessels of more than 20 meters in 
length, and shall be not less than 200 mm for vessels of 12 to 20 meters 
in length. The mass of the striker shall be not less than 3 percent of 
the mass of the bell. The striker shall be capable of manual operation. 
Note: When practicable, a power-driven bell striker is recommended to 
ensure constant force.

            Subpart A--Certificate of Alternative Compliance


<R05>
Sec. 89.1  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart:
    Inland Rules refers to the Inland Navigation Rules contained in the 
Inland Navigational Rules Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-591) and the technical 
annexes established under that act.
    A vessel of special construction or purpose means a vessel designed 
or modified to perform a special function and whose arrangement is 
thereby made relatively inflexible.
    Interference with the special function of the vessel occurs when 
installation or use of lights, shapes, or sound-signaling appliances 
under the Inland Rules prevents or significantly hinders the operation 
in which the vessel is usually engaged.

[CGD 80-157, 47 FR 13801, Apr. 1, 1982, as amended by CGD 83-028, 49 FR

<R05>
Sec. 89.3  General.

    Vessels of special construction or purpose which cannot fully comply 
with the light, shape, and sound signal provisions of the Inland Rules 
without interfering with their special function may instead meet 
alternative requirements. The Chief of the Marine Safety Division in 
each Coast Guard District Office makes this determination and requires 
that alternative compliance be as close as possible with the Inland 
Rules. These regulations set out the procedure by which a vessel may be 
certified for alternative compliance. The information collection and 
recordkeeping requirements in Secs. 89.5 and 89.18 have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 2115-0074.


<R05>
Sec. 89.5  Application for a Certificate of Alternative Compliance.

    (a) The owner, builder, operator, or agent of a vessel of special 
construction or purpose who believes the vessel cannot fully comply with 
the Inland Rules light, shape, or sound signal provisions without 
interference with its special function may apply for a determination 
that alternative compliance is justified. The application must be in 
writing, submitted to the Chief of the Marine Safety Division of the 
Coast Guard District in which the vessel is being built or operated, and 
include the following information:
    (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the applicant.
    (2) The identification of the vessel by its:
    (i) Official number;
    (ii) Shipyard hull number;
    (iii) Hull identification number; or
    (iv) State number, if the vessel does not have an official number or 
hull identification number.
    (3) Vessel name and home port, if known.
    (4) A description of the vessel's area of operation.
    (5) A description of the provision for which the Certificate of 
Alternative Compliance is sought, including:
    (i) The Inland Rules Rule or Annex section number for which the 
Certificate of Alternative Compliance is sought;
    (ii) A description of the special function of the vessel that would 
be interfered with by full compliance with the provision of that Rule or 
Annex section; and
    (iii) A statement of how full compliance would interfere with the 
special function of the vessel.
    (6) A description of the alternative installation that is in closest 
possible compliance with the applicable Inland Navigation Rules Rule or 
Annex section.
    (7) A copy of the vessel's plans or an accurate scale drawing that 
clearly shows:
    (i) The required installation of the equipment under the Inland 
Rules,
    (ii) The proposed installation of the equipment for which 
certification is being sought, and
    (iii) Any obstructions that may interfere with the equipment when 
installed in:
    (A) The required location; and
    (B) The proposed location.
    (b) The Coast Guard may request from the applicant additional 
information concerning the application.

recreational vessel underway, including but not limited to navigation of 
the vessel or control of the vessel's propulsion system.
    (b) The individual is a crewmember (including a licensed 
individual), pilot, or watchstander not a regular member of the crew, of 
a vessel other than a recreational vessel.


<R05>
Sec. 95.020  Standard of intoxication.

    An individual is intoxicated when:
    (a) The individual is operating a recreational vessel and has an 
alcohol concentration of .10 percent by weight or more in their blood;
    (b) The individual is operating a vessel other than a recreational 
vessel and has an alcohol concentration of .04 percent by weight or more 
in their blood; or,

Sec. 95.025  Adoption of State standards.

    (a) This section applies to recreational vessels on waters within 
the geographical boundaries of a State having a statute defining a 
percentage of alcohol in the blood for the purposes of establishing that 
a person operating a vessel is intoxicated or impaired due to alcohol.
    (b) If the applicable State statute establishing a standard for 
determining impairment due to alcohol uses the terms ``under the 
influence,'' ``operating while impaired,'' or equivalent terminology and 
does not separately define a percentage of alcohol in the blood for the 
purpose of establishing ``intoxication,'' the standard containing the 
highest defined percentage of alcohol in the blood applies in lieu of 
the standard in Sec. 95.020(a). If the applicable State statute contains 
a standard specifically applicable to establishing intoxication, in 
addition to standards applicable to other degrees of impairment, the 
standard specifically applicable to establishing intoxication applies in 
lieu of the standard in Sec. 95.020(a).
    (c) For the purposes of this part, a standard established by State 
statute and adopted under this section is applicable to the operation of 
any recreational vessel on waters within the geographical boundaries of

    (a) Only a law enforcement officer or a marine employer may direct 
an individual operating a vessel to undergo a chemical test when 
reasonable cause exists. Reasonable cause exists when:
    (1) The individual was directly involved in the occurrence of a 
marine casualty as defined in Chapter 61 of Title 46, United States 
Code, or
    (2) The individual is suspected of being in violation of the 
standards in Secs. 95.020 or 95.025.
    (b) When an individual is directed to undergo a chemical test, the 
individual to be tested must be informed of that fact and directed to 
undergo a test as soon as is practicable.
    (c) When practicable, a marine employer should base a determination 
of the existence of reasonable cause, under paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, on observation by two persons.

individual will be presumed to be intoxicated.
    (b) If an individual refuses to submit to or cooperate in the 
administration of a timely chemical test when directed by the marine 
employer based on reasonable cause, evidence of the refusal is 
admissible in evidence in any administrative proceeding.

licensed individual), pilot, or watchstander not a regular member of the 
crew:
    (a) Shall not perform or attempt to perform any scheduled duties 
within four hours of consuming any alcohol;
    (b) Shall not be intoxicated at any time;
    (c) Shall not consume any intoxicant while on watch or duty; and
    (d) May consume a legal non-prescription or prescription drug 
provided the drug does not cause the individual to be intoxicated.


<R05>

go to sea without presenting an unreasonable threat of harm to the port, 
the marine environment, the vessel or its crew. The detention order may 
allow the vessel to go to another area of the port, if needed, rather 
than stay at the place where the violation was found.
    (c) If any vessel that must comply with this part or with the ISM 
Code does not have a Safety Management Certificate and a copy of its 
company's Document of Compliance certificate on board, a vessel owner, 
charterer, managing operator, agent, Master, or any other individual in 
charge of the vessel that is subject to this part, may be liable for a 
civil penalty under 46 U.S.C. 3318. For foreign vessels, the Coast Guard 
may request the Secretary of the Treasury to withhold or revoke the 
clearance required by 46 U.S.C. App. 91. The Coast Guard may ask the 
Secretary to permit the vessel's departure after the bond or other 
surety is filed.


<R05>
Sec. 96.390  When will the Coast Guard deny entry into a U.S. port?

    (a) Except for a foreign vessel entering U.S. waters under force 
majeure, no vessel shall enter any port or terminal of the U.S. without 
a safety management system that has been properly certificated to this 
subpart or to the requirements of Chapter IX of SOLAS if--
    (1) It is engaged on a foreign voyage; and
    (2) It is carrying more than 12 passengers, or a tanker, bulk 
freight vessel, freight vessel, or self-propelled mobile offshore 
drilling unit of 500 gross tons or more.
    (b) The cognizant COTP will deny entry of a vessel into a port or 
terminal under the authority of 46 U.S.C. 3204(c), to any vessel that 
does not meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

organizations recognized under 46 CFR part 8, subparts A and B, to be 
authorized by the Coast Guard to act on behalf of the U.S. The 
authorization is necessary in order for a recognized organization to 
perform safety management audits and certification functions delegated 
by the Coast Guard as described in this part.
    (b) To receive an up-to-date list of recognized organizations 
authorized to act under this subpart, send a self-addressed, stamped 
envelope and written request to the Commandant (G-MSE), 2100 Second 
Street SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001.


<R05>
Sec. 96.410  Who does this regulation apply to?

    This subpart applies to all organizations recognized by the U.S. 
under 46 CFR part 8, subpart A and B, who wish to seek authorization to

certificates under the provisions of the ISM Code and voluntary 
certificates on behalf of the U.S.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 96.430  How does an organization submit a request to be authorized?

    (a) A recognized organization must send a written request for 
authorization to the Commandant (G-MSE), Office of Design and 
Engineering Standards, 2100 Second Street SW, Washington, DC 20593-0001. 
The request must include the following:
    (1) A statement describing what type of authorization the 
organization seeks;
    (2) Documents showing that--
    (i) The organization has an internal quality system with written 
policies, procedures and processes that meet the requirements in 
Sec. 96.440 of this part for safety management auditing and 
certification; or
    (ii) The organization has an internal quality system based on ANSI/
ASQC C9001 for safety management auditing and certification; or
    (iii) The organization has an equivalent internal quality standard 
system recognized by the Coast Guard to complete safety management 
audits and certification.
    (3) A list of the organization's exclusive auditors qualified to 
complete safety management audits and their operational area; and
    (4) A written statement that the procedures and records of the 
recognized organization regarding its actions involving safety 
management system audits and certification are available for review 
annually and at any time deemed necessary by the Coast Guard.
    (b) If the organization is a foreign classification society that has 
been recognized under 46 CFR part 8, subparts A and B, and wishes to 
apply for authorization under this part, it must demonstrate the 
reciprocity required by 46 U.S.C. 3316 for ISM Code certification. The 
organization must provide, with its request for authorization an 
affidavit from the government of the country in which the classification 
society is headquartered. This affidavit must provide a list of 
authorized delegations by the flag state of the administration of the 
foreign classification society's country to the American Bureau of 
Shipping, and indicate any conditions related to the delegated 
authority. If this affidavit is not received with a request for 
authorization from a foreign classification society, the request for 
authorization will be disapproved and returned by the Coast Guard.
    (c) Upon the satisfactory completion of the Coast Guard's evaluation 
of a request for authorization, the organization will be visited for an 
evaluation as described in Sec. 96.440(b) of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 96.440  How will the Coast Guard decide whether to approve an organization's request to be authorized?

    (a) First, the Coast Guard will evaluate the organization's request 
for authorization and supporting written materials, looking for evidence 
of the following--
    (1) The organization's clear assignment of management duties;
    (2) Ethical standards for managers and auditors;
    (3) Procedures for auditor training, qualification, certification, 
and requalification that are consistent with recognized industry 
standards;
    (4) Procedures for auditing safety management systems that are 
consistent with recognized industry standards and IMO Resolution 
A.788(19);
    (5) Acceptable standards for internal auditing and management 
review;
    (6) Record-keeping standards for safety management auditing and 
certification;
    (7) Methods for reporting non-conformities and recording completion 
of remedial actions;
    (8) Methods for certifying safety management systems;
    (9) Methods for periodic and intermediate audits of safety 
management systems;
    (10) Methods for renewal audits of safety management systems;
    (11) Methods for handling appeals; and
    (12) Overall procedures consistent with IMO Resolution A.739(18), 
``Guidelines for the Authorization of Organizations Acting on Behalf of 
the Administration.''
    (b) After a favorable evaluation of the organization's written 
request, the Coast Guard will arrange to visit the organization's 
corporate offices and port offices for an on-site evaluation of 
operations.

[[Page 241]]

    (c) When a request is approved, the recognized organization and the 
Coast Guard will enter into a written agreement. This agreement will 
define the scope, terms, conditions and requirements of the 
authorization. Conditions of this agreement are found in Sec. 96.460 of 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 96.450  What happens if the Coast Guard disapproves an organization's request to be authorized?

    (a) The Coast Guard will write to the organization explaining why it 
did not meet the criteria for authorization.
    (b) The organization may then correct the deficiencies and reapply.


<R05>
Sec. 96.460  How will I know what the Coast Guard requires of my organization if my organization receives authorization?

    (a) Your organization will enter into a written agreement with the 
Coast Guard. This written agreement will specify--
    (1) How long the authorization is valid;
    (2) Which duties and responsibilities the organization may perform, 
and which certificates it may issue on behalf of the U.S.;
    (3) Reports and information the organization must send to the 
Commandant (G-MOC);
    (4) Actions the organization must take to renew the agreement when 
it expires; and
    (5) Actions the organization must take if the Coast Guard should 
revoke its authorization or recognition under 46 CFR part 8.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 96.470  How does the Coast Guard terminate an organization's authorization?

    At least every 12 months, the Coast Guard evaluates organizations 
authorized under this subpart. If an organization fails to maintain 
acceptable standards, the Coast Guard may terminate that organization's 
authorization, remove the organization from the Commandant's list of 
recognized organizations, and further evaluate the organization's 
recognition under 46 CFR part 8.


<R05>
Sec. 96.480  What is the status of a certificate if the issuing organization has its authority terminated?

    Any certificate issued by an organization authorized by the Coast 
Guard whose authorization is later terminated remains valid until--
    (a) Its original expiration date,
    (b) The date of the next periodic audit required to maintain the 
certificate's validity, or
    (c) Whichever of paragraphs (a) or (b) occurs first.


<R05>
Sec. 96.490  What further obligations exist for an organization if the Coast Guard terminates its authorization?

    The written agreement by which an organization receives 
authorization from the Coast Guard places it under certain obligations 
if the Coast Guard revokes that authorization. The organization agrees 
to send written notice of its termination to all responsible persons, 
companies and vessels that have received certificates from the 
organization. In that notice, the organization must include--
    (a) A written statement explaining why the organization's 
authorization was terminated by the Coast Guard;
    (b) An explanation of the status of issued certificates;
    (c) A current list of organizations authorized by the Coast Guard to 
conduct safety management audits; and
    (d) A statement of what the companies and vessels must do to have 
their safety management systems transferred to another organization 
authorized to act on behalf of the U.S.


<R05>
Sec. 96.495  How can I appeal a decision made by an authorized organization?

    (a) A responsible person may appeal a decision made by an authorized 
organization by mailing or delivering to the organization a written 
request for reconsideration. Within 30 days of receiving your request, 
the authorized organization must rule on it and send you a written 
response. They must also send a copy of their response to the Commandant 
(G-MOC).
    (b) If you are not satisfied with the organization's decision, you 
may appeal directly to the Commandant (G-MOC). You must make your appeal 
in

[[Page 242]]

writing, including any documentation and evidence you wish to be 
considered. You may ask the Commandant (G-MOC) to stay the effect of the 
appealed decision while it is under review.
    (c) The Commandant (G-MOC) will make a decision on your appeal and 
send you a response in writing. That decision will be the final Coast 
Guard action on your request.

Sec. 100.901  Great Lakes annual marine events.

    Permanent special local regulations are hereby established for the 
marine events listed in Table 1. These regulations will be effective 
annually, for the duration of each event, on or about the dates 
indicated in Table 1. Annual notice of the exact dates and times of the 
effective period of the regulations with

[[Page 295]]

respect to each event, the geographical description of each regulated 
area, and details concerning the nature of the event and the number of 
participants and type(s) of vessels involved will be published in local 
notices to mariners. To be placed on the mailing list for such notices, 
contact: Commander(oan), Ninth Coast Guard District, 1240 E. Ninth St., 
Cleveland, OH 44199-2060. Sponsors of events listed in Table 1 must 
still submit an application each year in accordance with 33 CFR 100.15.
    (a) The Coast Guard will patrol the regatta area under the direction 
of a designated Coast Guard Patrol Commander. The Patrol Commander may 
be contacted on Channel 16 (156.8 MHZ) by the call sign ``Coast Guard 
Patrol Commander.'' Vessels desiring to transit the regulated area may 
do so only with prior approval of the Patrol Commander and when so 
directed by that officer. Vessels will be operated at a no wake speed to 
reduce the wake to a minimum, and in a manner which will not endanger 
participants in the event or any other craft. The rules contained in the 
above two sentences shall not apply to participants in the event or 
vessels of the patrol operating in the performance of their assigned 
duties.
    (b) The Patrol Commander may direct the anchoring, mooring, or 
movement of any boat or vessel within the regatta area. A succession of 
sharp, short signals by whistle or horn from vessels patrolling the area 
under the direction of the U.S. Coast Guard Patrol Commander shall serve 
as a signal to stop. Vessels so signaled shall stop and shall comply 
with the orders of the Patrol Commander. Failure to do so may result in 
expulsion from the area, citation for failure to comply, or both.
    (c) The Patrol Commander may establish vessel size and speed 
limitations and operating conditions.
    (d) The Patrol Commander may restrict vessel operation within the 
regatta area to vessels having particular operating characteristics.
    (e) The Patrol Commander may terminate the marine event or the 
operation of any vessel at any time it is deemed necessary for the 
protection of life and property.

Sec. 109.01  Purpose.

    The purpose of the rules and regulations in this subchapter is to 
implement certain laws and set forth the requirements for anchorage 
areas.

(33 U.S.C. 471, 180, 258, 322, and 499; 49 CFR 1.46(c) and 1.45(b))

<R05>
Sec. 109.05  Anchorage grounds.

    (a) Section 7 of the River and Harbor Act of March 4, 1915 (33 
U.S.C. 471), authorizes the establishment of anchorage grounds for 
vessels in navigable waters of the United States whenever it is apparent 
that these are required by the maritime or commercial interests of the 
United States for safe navigation. The statute also authorizes the 
adoption of suitable rules and regulations regarding the establishment 
of anchorage grounds, which are enforced by the Coast Guard. The 
authority conferred by this statute was transferred to and vested in the 
Secretary of Transportation by section 6(g)(1)(A) of the Department of 
Transportation Act (80 Stat. 931) and delegated to the Commandant of the 
U.S. Coast Guard in Sec. 1.46 of Title 49 CFR, and redelegated the 
authority to establish anchorage grounds to each Coast Guard District 
Commander in Sec. 1.05-1(e)(1)(i) of this title.
    (b) District Commanders will, whenever matters relating to the 
anchorage of vessels are under consideration, ascertain the view of the 
District and Division Engineer, Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, and the 
proper representatives of other departments likely to be interested, 
including the Commandant of the Naval District concerned and the medical 
officer in charge of the quarantine station at localities where 
quarantine anchorages are involved, in order that they may arrange for 
suitable representation at such hearings. The views of the medical 
officer in charge of the quarantine station relating to the proposed 
location and boundaries of the quarantine anchorage will be accepted 
insofar as practicable and consistent with the establishment of other 
anchorage areas. (An Act of Congress approved July 1, 1944, as amended 
(42 U.S.C. 267), authorizes the Surgeon General, with the approval of 
the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, to designate the 
boundaries of the quarantine grounds and quarantine anchorages for 
vessels which are reserved for use at each United States quarantine 
station.) A notice of public hearing concerning changes to the Anchorage 
Regulations will be issued by the District Commander and will be mailed 
to all known interested parties. After providing an opportunity for 
public participation, the District Commander will, if circumstances so 
warrant, issue changes to the Anchorage Regulations, or in appropriate 
cases forward recommendations for such changes to the Commandant.
    (c) As soon as publication has been noted in the Federal Register, 
the District Commander will publish changes to the Anchorage Regulations 
in the Local Notice to Mariners.

<R05>
Sec. 109.07  Anchorages under Ports and Waterways Safety Act.

    The provisions of section 4 (a) and (b) of the Ports and Waterways 
Safety Act as delegated to the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard in 49 
CFR 1.46(n)(4) authorize the Commandant to specify times of movement 
within ports and harbors, restrict vessel operations in hazardous areas 
and under hazardous conditions, and direct the anchoring of vessels. The 
sections listed in Sec. 110.1a of this subchapter are regulated under 
the Ports and Waterways Safety Act.

(33 U.S.C. 1221 et seq.; 33 U.S.C. 471; 49 U.S.C. 1655(g)(1); 49 CFR 
1.46(n); 49 CFR 1.46(c)(1))


[CGD 3-81-1A, 47 FR 4063, Jan. 28, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 109.10  Special anchorage areas.

    An Act of Congress of April 22, 1940, provides for the designation 
of special anchorage areas wherein vessels not more than sixty-five feet 
in length, when at anchor, will not be required to carry or exhibit 
anchorage lights. Such designation is to be made after investigation, by 
rule, regulation, or order, the procedure for which will be similar to 
that followed for anchorage grounds under section 7 of the River and 
Harbor Act of March 4, 1915, as referred to in Sec. 109.05. The areas so 
designated should be well removed from the fairways and located where 
general navigation will not endanger or be endangered by unlighted 
vessels. The authority to designate special anchorage areas was 
transferred to and vested in the Secretary of Transportation by section 
6(g)(1)(D) of the Department of Transportation Act (80 Stat. 931) and 
delegated to the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard under Sec. 1.46 of 
Title 49 CFR, who has redelegated pursuant to the authority to establish 
special anchorage areas to each Coast Guard District Commander in 
Sec. 1.05-1(e)(1)(i).

(33 U.S.C. 471, 180, 258, 322, and 499; 49 CFR 1.46(c) and 1.45(b))


[CGD 79-096, 44 FR 51585, Sept. 4, 1979, as amended by USCG-1998-3799, 
63 FR 35526, June 30, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 109.15  Enforcement proceedings.

    Proceedings against a vessel violating the Anchorage Regulations are 
to be brought in the name of the officer of the Coast guard assigned for 
the time being as Captain of the Port. When the vessel is at a port 
where there is no Coast Guard officer, proceedings will be initiated in 
the name of the District Commander.

[CGFR 67-46, 32 FR 17727, Dec. 12, 1967]


<R05>
Sec. 109.20  Publication; notice of proposed rule making.

    (a) Section 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), 
requires publication of general notice of proposed rule making in the 
Federal Register (unless all persons subject thereto are named and 
either personally served or otherwise have actual notice thereof in 
accordance with law), except to the extent that there is involved (1) 
any military, naval, or foreign affairs function of the United States or 
(2) any matter relating to agency management or personnel or to public 
property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts. Except where notice or 
hearing is required by statute, this requirement does not apply to 
interpretative rules, general statements of policy, rules of agency 
organization, procedure, or practice, or in any situation in which the 
agency for good cause finds (and incorporates the finding and a brief 
statement of the reasons therefor in the rules issued) that notice and 
public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to 
the public interest.
    (b) General notice of proposed rule making published in accordance 
with the above will include (1) a statement of the time, place, and 
nature of public rule making proceedings; (2) reference to the authority 
under which the rule is proposed; and (3) either the terms or substance 
of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues 
involved.

permit is issued agrees to hold harmless the United States, its 
officers, agents, and employees, for any death, personal injury, or

Jersey, outside of the anchorage areas established in this section, or 
within a cable or pipe line area shown on a Government chart, or be 
moored, anchored, or tied up to any pier, wharf, or other vessel in such 
manner as to obstruct or endanger the passage of any vessel. When an 
emergent condition exists due to congestion in the prescribed anchorage 
areas in the Delaware River, the Captain of the Port may authorize the 
anchorage of vessels in locations other than the prescribed areas. 
Vessels so anchored must not be anchored within the channel limits. Any 
vessel anchored outside of the prescribed anchorage limits must move to 
a prescribed anchorage area when space becomes available.
    (2) No vessel shall occupy any prescribed anchorage for a longer 
period than 48 hours without a permit from the Captain of the Port. 
Vessels expecting to be at anchor for more than 48 hours shall obtain a 
permit from the Captain of the Port for that purpose. No vessel in such 
condition that it is likely to sink or otherwise become a menace or 
obstruction to navigation or anchorage of other vessels shall occupy an 
anchorage except in an emergency, and then only for such period as may 
be permitted by the Captain of the Port.
    (3) Whenever, in the opinion of the Captain of the Port such action 
may be necessary, he may require any or all vessels in any designated 
anchorage area to moor with two or more anchors.
    (4) [Reserved]
    (5) Anchors shall be placed well within the anchorage areas, so that 
no portion of the hull or rigging will at any time extend outside of the 
anchorage area.
    (6) Light-draft barges using the anchorages shall be anchored away 
from the deeper portions of the anchorages, so as not to interfere with 
the anchoring of deep-draft vessels. Any barges towed in tandem to an 
anchorage area shall be bunched together when anchoring.
    (7) Upon approval of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, the 
Captain of the Port may permit wrecking plant or other vessels legally 
engaged in recovering sunken property, or in laying or repairing pipe 
lines or cables, or plant engaged in dredging operations, to anchor in 
channels. Such permission is not necessary for plant engaged upon works 
of river and harbor improvement under the supervision of the District 
Engineer, but the District Engineer will notify the Captain of the Port 
in advance of all such proposed work.
    (8) [Reserved]
    (9) A vessel upon being notified to shift its position shall get 
under way at once or signal for a tug and shall change position as 
directed with reasonable promptness.
    (10) Nothing in this section shall be construed as relieving any 
vessel or the owner or person in charge of any vessel from the penalties 
of law for obstructing navigation or for obstructing or interfering with 
range lights, or for not complying with the laws relating to lights and 
fog signals or other navigation laws and regulations.
    (c) Regulations for vessels carrying and handling explosives. (1) 
All vessels carrying explosives as defined in and subject to Title 49 
Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 171 through 177, or on which such 
explosives are to be loaded, shall obtain a permit from the Captain of 
the Port, except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. The 
maximum amount of explosives for which a permit is required in 49 CFR 
Parts 171 through 177, which may be carried or loaded at any time by a 
vessel shall not exceed 800 tons, except in cases of great emergency or 
by special permit from the Captain of the Port. This written permit 
shall be obtained from the Captain of the Port before vessels carrying 
explosives or on which explosives are to be loaded within the weight 
limit

[[Page 378]]

specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, may anchor in any 
anchorge. Permits will not be issued for Anchorage 2 under any 
circumstances. Such permit may be revoked at any time. All vessels used 
in connection with loading, or unloading explosives shall carry written 
permits from the Captain of the Port, and shall show such permit 
whenever required by him or his representative.
    (2) Vessels handling explosives shall be anchored so as to be at 
least 2,200 feet from any other vessel, but the number of vessels which 
may anchor in an anchorage at any one time shall be at the discretion of 
the Captain of the Port. This provision is not intended to prohibit 
barges or lighters from tying up alongside the vessels for the transfer 
of cargo.
    (3) Whenever a vessel or barge not mechanically self-propelled 
anchors while carrying explosives or while awaiting the loading of 
explosives, the Captain of the Port may require the attendance of a tug 
upon such vessel or barge when in his judgment such action is necessary.
    (4) Fishing and navigation are prohibited within an anchorage 
whenever occupied by an anchored vessel displaying a red flag.
    (5) The District Engineer, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, may 
authorize, in writing, a vessel carrying explosives for use on river and 
harbor works or on other work under Department of the Army permit, to 
anchor in or near the vicinity of such work. The Captain of the Port 
will prescribe the conditions under which explosives shall be stored and 
handled in such cases.
    (6) Vessels carrying explosives or on which explosives are to be 
loaded, within the weight limit specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, shall comply with the general regulations in paragraph (b) of 
this section when applicable.
    (7) Nothing in this section shall be construed as relieving any 
vessel or the owner or person-in-charge of any vessel, and all others 
concerned, of the duties and responsibilities imposed upon them to 
comply with the regulations governing the handling, loading or 
discharging of explosives entitled ``Subchapter C--Hazardous Materials 
Regulations'' (49 CFR Parts 171 through 177).

endanger the passage of any other vessel.
    (2) No vessel in such condition that it is likely to sink or 
otherwise become a menace or obstruction to navigation or anchorage of 
other vessels, shall occupy an anchorage except in cases where 
unforeseen circumstances create conditions of imminent peril to 
personnel and then only for such period as may be authorized by the 
Captain of the Port.
    (3) Whenever, in the opinion of the Captain of the Port, such action 
may be necessary, he may require any vessel in a designated anchorage 
area to moor with two or more anchors.

weigh anchor at any time shall be anchored with two anchors with mooring 
swivel, unless the Captain of the Port, upon application, waives this 
requirement.

[[Page 380]]

    (5) Light-draft barges shall be anchored away from the deeper 
portions of the anchorages, so as not to interfere with the anchoring of 
deep-draft vessels. Any barges towed in tandem to an anchorage area 
shall be nested together when anchoring.
    (6) No vessel shall be navigated within an anchorage at a speed 
exceeding 6 knots.
    (7) A vessel being notified by the Captain of the Port or his 
authorized representative to shift its position shall take steps to 
promptly make the change.
    (8) Nothing in this section shall be construed as relieving any 
vessel, or the owner or person in charge of any vessel, from the 
penalties of law for obstructing navigation or for obstructing or 
interfering with range lights, or for not complying with the laws 
relating to lights, day signals and fog signals or other navigation laws 
and regulations.

than 24 hours.
    (b) The regulations. (1) Except in cases of great emergency, no 
vessel shall be anchored in the main ship channels as defined by broken 
lines marking their boundaries on NOAA Chart 11524. Vessels must be 
anchored in such a way as not to interfere with the free navigation of 
channels in the port, including Cooper, Ashley, Wando Rivers, and Town 
Creek, nor to obstruct the approach to any pier or entrance to any slip, 
nor to impede the movement of any vessel or craft.
    (2) Vessels using the anchorages opposite the eastern waterfront of 
Charleston shall place their anchors as near as possible in the center 
of the anchorage. Vessels not using a designated commercial anchorage 
shall not place their anchors within the main ship channels, nor shall 
be so anchored as to swing within 400 feet of any wharf or pier on the 
eastern waterfront of Charleston. Vessels may be so anchored as to swing 
into the main ship channels only if they are so placed with reference to 
the customary winds, tides, and currents of the harbor, as to swing only 
during slack water, and that during this period there shall remain in 
the waters adjacent to the channel an area of sufficient depth as to 
permit the safe passage of loaded vessels.
    (3) No vessel may anchor within the designated anchorages for more 
than 72 hours without the prior approval of the Captain of the Port.
    (4) No vessel may anchor unless it maintains a bridge watch, guards 
and answers Channel 16 FM, and maintains an accurate position plot.
    (5) If any anchored vessel is so close to another that a collision 
is probable, each vessel must communicate with the other vessel and the 
Captain of the Port on Channel 16 FM and shall act to eliminate the 
close proximity situation.
    (6) No vessel may anchor unless it maintains the capability to get 
underway within 4 hours.
    (7) No vessel may anchor in a ``dead ship'' status (propulsion or 
control unavailable for normal operations) without the prior approval of 
the Captain of the Port.
    (8) Dragging of anchors in or across main ship channels and cable 
areas is prohibited.
    (9) Vessels which, through force of great emergency, are anchored 
contrary to the foregoing regulations in this section shall be shifted 
to new berths in accordance with such regulations at the earliest 
opportunity.
    (10) A vessel, upon notification from the Captain of the Port to 
shift its position in anchorage grounds must get underway at once or 
signal for a tug, and must change position as directed with reasonable 
promptness.
    (11) No vessel may conduct lightering operations in an anchorage 
without permission from the Captain of the Port.
    (12) When the use of an anchorage is required by naval vessels, the 
vessels anchored therein shall move when the Captain of the Port directs 
them.
    (13) Nothing in this section shall be construed as relieving the 
owner or person in charge of any vessel from the penalties of law for 
obstructing navigation, or for obstructing or interfering with range 
lights, or for not complying with the navigation laws in regard to 
lights, fog signals, etc.

Sec. 110.214  Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors, California.

    (a) General Regulations. 
    (1) Anchorage Assignment. (i) Unless otherwise directed by the 
Captain of the Port Los Angeles-Long Beach, the pilot stations for the 
Port of Long Beach and the Port of Los Angeles will assign the use of 
commercial anchorages within their jurisdictions (Long Beach and Los 
Angeles Harbors respectively). All anchorages outside (seaward) of the 
federal breakwater will be assigned by the Los Angeles-Long Beach Vessel 
Traffic Information Service (VTIS). The master, pilot, or person in 
charge of a vessel must notify the appropriate pilot station (for 
anchorages inside the federal breakwater) or the VTIS (for anchorages 
outside the federal breakwater) of their intention to anchor, upon 
anchoring, and at least fifteen minutes prior to departing an anchorage. 
All anchorage assignments will be made as described in this part unless 
modified by the Captain of the Port.

[[Page 403]]

    (ii) Radio communications for port entities governing anchorages are 
as follows: Los Angeles-Long Beach Vessel Traffic Information Service, 
call sign ``LA-Long Beach Traffic,'' Channel 14 VHF-FM; Los Angeles Port 
Pilots, Channel 73 VHF-FM; Long Beach Port Pilots, Channel 74 VHF-FM.
    (iii) The exact boundary separating the Port of Long Beach from the 
Port of Los Angeles is published in local Port Tariffs. For purposes of 
this rule, Long Beach waters are those east, and Los Angeles waters are 
those west, of the following locations:
    (A) Inner Harbor: The Henry Ford (Badger Avenue) Bridge.
    (B) Middle Harbor: The Pier 400 Transportation Corridor.
    (C) Outer Harbor: The western boundary of Commercial Anchorage B.
    (2) Required approvals, permits and notifications. 
    (i) No vessel may anchor anywhere within Los Angeles or Long Beach 
harbors for more than 10 consecutive days unless an extended anchorage 
permit is obtained from the Captain of the Port. In determining whether 
an extended anchorage permit will be granted, consideration will be 
given, but not necessarily limited to: the current and anticipated 
demands for anchorage space within the harbor, the duration requested, 
the condition of the vessel, and the reason for the request.
    (ii) No vessel while carrying, loading, or unloading division 1.1 or 
1.2 materials as defined in 49 CFR 173.50, or Cargoes of Particular 
Hazard (COPH) as defined in 33 CFR 126.10, or Certain Dangerous Cargoes 
(CDC) as defined in 33 CFR 160.203, may anchor without first obtaining a 
permit issued by the Captain of the Port.
    (iii) Vessels requiring use of an explosives anchorage should 
contact the Captain of the Port at least 24 hours prior to the 
anticipated need for the explosives anchorage to allow for proper 
activation of that anchorage.
    (iv) Except with the prior approval of the Captain of the Port, or, 
in the case of an emergency, with approval of the Captain of the Port 
immediately subsequent to anchoring, no commercial vessel greater than 
1600 gross tons may anchor in Los Angeles-Long Beach Harbor unless it 
maintains the capability to get underway within 30 minutes. Any vessel 
unable to meet this requirement must immediately notify the Captain of 
the Port and make arrangements for an adequate number of tugs to respond 
to the vessel within 30 minutes notice.
    (v) In anchorages where lightering is authorized, the Captain of the 
Port must be notified at least 4 hours in advance of a vessel conducting 
lightering operations (see 33 CFR 156.118).
    (3) Other General Requirements. 
    (i) When at anchor, all commercial vessels greater than 1600 gross 
tons shall, at all times, have a licensed deck officer on watch and 
maintain a continuous radio listening watch unless subject to one of the 
exemptions in this paragraph. The radio watch must be on CH-13 VHF-FM 
when anchored inside the federal breakwater, and on CH-14 VHF-FM or on 
CH-16 VHF-FM when anchored outside the federal breakwater, except for 
unmanned barges; vessels which have less than 100 gallons of oil or fuel 
onboard regardless of how the fuel is carried; and other vessels 
receiving advance approval from the Captain of the Port.
    (ii) When sustained wind speeds exceed 40 knots, all anchored 
commercial vessels greater than 1600 gross tons shall ensure their 
propulsion plant is placed in immediate standby and a second anchor is 
made ready to let go. Vessels unable to comply with this requirement 
must immediately notify the Captain of the Port. In such case, the 
Captain of the Port may require the vessel to have one or more tugs 
standing by to render immediate assistance.
    (4) Prohibitions. Within Los Angeles Harbor, Long Beach Harbor, and 
the Los Angeles-Long Beach Precautionary Area, except for emergency 
reasons, or with the prior approval of the Captain of the Port, vessels 
are prohibited from anchoring outside of designated anchorage areas. In 
the event a vessel anchors outside a designated anchorage area for 
emergency reasons, the master, pilot, or person in charge of the vessel 
shall:
    (i) Position the vessel so as to minimize the danger to other 
vessels and facilities;

[[Page 404]]

    (ii) Immediately notify the Captain of the Port by the most 
expeditious means of the vessel's location and the reason(s) for the 
emergency anchoring; and
    (iii) Move the vessel as soon as the emergency condition prompting 
anchoring outside a designated area abates, or as soon as ordered to 
move by the Captain of the Port, whichever occurs sooner.
    (5) Exemption from rules. The Captain of the Port may, upon request, 
or whenever he/she deems appropriate, authorize a deviation from any 
rule in this section.

<R05>
Sec. 114.10  General policies on issuance of permits and drawbridge operation regulations.

    The several bridge laws referenced in Sec. 114.01 Purpose, are 
intended to prevent any interference with navigable waters of the United 
States whether by bridges, dams, dikes or other obstructions to 
navigation except by express permission of the United States. The 
decision as to whether a bridge permit or a drawbridge operation 
regulation will be issued or promulgated must rest primarily upon the 
effect of the proposed action on navigation to assure that the action 
provides for the reasonable needs of navigation after full consideration 
of the effect of the proposed action on the human environment. The Coast 
Guard is not responsible for any other permits that the applicant may 
need from other federal, state, or local agencies and issuance of a 
bridge permit does not affect flood control projects or other 
governmental programs.

[CGD 82-006, 47 FR 36640, Aug. 23, 1982, as amended by USCG-2000-7223, 
65 FR 40056, June 29, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 114.20  Departure from permit plans.

    (a) If the final inspection shows a minor departure from the 
authorized plans which does not materially affect navigation, the 
permittee will be required to furnish a tracing showing the work as 
actually constructed but no further action will be taken by the Coast 
Guard.
    (b) It is not the practice of the Coast Guard to issue letters 
certifying that completed work conforms to that which was authorized. 
That question is a matter of fact to be determined in case of 
controversy by the usual rules of court procedure.

[[Page 431]]


<R05>
Sec. 114.25  Work constructed without prior authority.

    The Commandant or District Commander will approve plans and issue 
permits authorizing bridges across navigable waters, in cases where the 
application therefor is submitted after the commencement or completion 
of the bridges subject to the following rules: Approval will be limited 
to those cases where the necessary primary authority, State or Federal 
as the case may be, validly existed, when the work was innocently 
constructed, and where the work will not unreasonably interfere with 
navigation. Upon issuance of the permit, applicant will be informed that 
the law contemplates prior approval and that in the future plans must be 
submitted in ample time for their consideration by the Commandant or 
District Commander before construction is begun.

(5 U.S.C. 559; 14 U.S.C. 633; 33 U.S.C. 401, 491, 499, and 525; 49 
U.S.C. 1655(g), and 49 CFR 1.46(c) and (q))

[CGD 80-099, 46 FR 38354, July 27, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 114.30  Revocation.

    Permits may be revoked by the issuing official for failure on the 
part of the permittee to comply with any of the conditions therein, or 
where the structures or other work constitute an unreasonable 
obstruction to navigation or to operations of the United States in the 
interest of navigation or flood control.

[CGD 82-006, 47 FR 36640, Aug. 23, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 114.40  Violations of law.

    The Coast Guard has the authority and responsibility for enforcement 
of the applicable provisions of law for the pretection and preservation 
of navigable waters. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to secure 
compliance with these provisions of law short of legal proceedings. As a 
general principle, no action is taken when the violation is minor, 
unintentional, or accidental and the party responsible corrects the 
violation. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to implement civil or 
criminal proceedings in all other circumstances. These proceedings are 
in subpart 1.07 of Part 1 of this chapter.

(Secs. 107, 108, Pub. L. 97-322, 96 Stat. 1582; (33 U.S.C. 495, 499, 
502, 525, 533); 49 CFR 1.46(c))

[CGD 82-102, 47 FR 54299, Dec. 2, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 114.45  Applications, extensions of time.

    Extensions of time to commence or complete construction of a bridge 
or remove a bridge that has been replaced as an element of a permitted 
bridge project must be submitted to, and received by the District 
Commander at least 30 days before the existing permit expires to allow 
the permit to remain in effect until the final agency action is taken.

<R05>
Sec. 114.50  Right of appeal.

    A District Commander's decision to deny a bridge permit application 
or an application for drawbridge operation regulations may be appealed 
to the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard. The appeal must be submitted in 
writing to the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration, 2100 Second 
Street SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001, within 60 days of the District 
Commander's decision. The Commandant will take action on the appeal 
within 90 days of its receipt.

<R05>
Sec. 115.01  Purpose.

    This part states the requirements for applying for a permit for 
construction of or modification to bridges crossing the navigable waters 
of the United States. It also sets forth the procedures by which the 
application is processed by the Coast Guard.

[CGD 82-006, 47 FR 36641, Aug. 23, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 115.05  Necessary primary authority.

    For bridges constructed by State or municipal agencies, the primary 
authority will be presumed without proof. If the law of the State 
requires a license for or approval of the bridge from a constituted 
State agency, a copy of such license or approval will be required and 
may be accepted as evidence of the primary authority. If there be no 
State regulation of bridges in navigable waters, the necessary primary 
authority may be that granted in the charter of a corporation, or the 
authority inherent in the ownership of the land on which the structure 
is placed. The applicant will in such cases be required to furnish an 
extract from the charter, or a statement of ownership. Especial care 
will be taken that Federal approval is not granted when there is doubt 
of the right of the builder to construct and utilize the bridge.


<R05>
Sec. 115.10  Limiting date in permits.

    (a) Specific time limitations are inserted in all permits for the 
commencement of construction and completion thereof. Normally three 
years for start of construction and two additional years for completion 
may be allowed.
    (b) Specific time limitations are inserted in all permits for the 
removal of bridges being replaced in whole or in part by the newly 
permitted bridges where removal thereof is required as a condition of 
the permit. Normally 90 days for removal after completion of the new 
bridge or opening to land transportation, whichever occurs first, may be 
allowed.

[CGD 75-046, 40 FR 24898, June 11, 1975, as amended by CGD 80-099, 46 FR 
38354, July 27, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 115.15  Permit bonds.

    When compensatory works or the removal of temporary structures 
should be required of the permittee, or in other unusual cases when 
there is reason to anticipate that the permittee may fail to carry out 
parts of the work that are against his interest, an additional condition 
will be included in the permit requiring the permittee to furnish a bond 
insuring compliance with the permit requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 115.20  Transfer of permits.

    Permits express merely the assent of the Federal Government so far 
as concerns the public rights of navigation. Although issued to a 
specific party, the assent is not limited to execution of the work by 
that party and may be availed of by the assignees or purchasers of the 
property affected, provided the terms of the instrument are strictly 
complied with.


<R05>
Sec. 115.30  Sufficiency of State authority for bridges.

    An opinion of the attorney general of the State as to the 
sufficiency of State authority for the construction of a bridge is 
acceptable to the Coast Guard in doubtful cases.


<R05>
Sec. 115.40  Bridge repairs.

    Repairs to a bridge which do not alter the clearances, type of 
structure, or any integral part of the substructure or superstructure or 
navigation conditions, but which consist only in the replacement of worn 
or obsolete parts, may, if the bridge is a legally approved structure, 
be made as routine maintenance without approval of the U.S. Coast Guard.


<R05>
Sec. 115.50  Application for bridge permits.

    (a) Approval of plans. An application for authorization to construct 
a bridge

[[Page 433]]

across navigable waters of the United States must show the name and 
address of the applicant; the waterway and location of the bridge; 
citation to the act of Congress or the State legislature authorizing the 
bridge; be accompanied by a map of the location and plans of the bridge 
showing the features which affect navigation; and papers to establish 
the identity of the applicant.
    (b) Prior authority necessary. Except as provided under paragraph 
(c) of this section, a bridge cannot lawfully be constructed across any 
navigable waterway of the United States until the location and plans 
have been approved by the Coast Guard.
    (c) Prior authority not necessary. Coast Guard approval of the 
location and plans for construction or modification of a bridge or 
causeway is not required for any bridge or causeway over waters which 
are not subject to the ebb and flow of the tide and which are not used 
and are not susceptible to use in their natural condition or by 
reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign 
commerce, whether or not such waters were used or were susceptible to 
use, at some previous time, to transport commerce (historic use). This 
provision does not apply to bridges which connect the United States with 
any foreign country.
    (d) Form. The application for the approval of plans consists of a 
letter accompanied with maps and plans of the proposed structure.
    (e) Signature. In case of signature by an agent or by an official of 
a corporation, a duly authenticated copy of the authority for the action 
must accompany the application.
    (f) Identification. If the applicant is a corporation, it must 
furnish certified copies of the following papers, all properly 
authenticated: The charter or articles of incorporation; the minutes of 
organization; extract from minutes showing the names of the present 
officers of the corporation.
    (1) Where State laws vest in State or county officers, such as 
boards of supervisors and county courts, the power to authorize the 
construction of bridges, they must furnish with their application 
certified extracts from their proceedings showing their action 
authorizing the proposed structure.
    (g) Plans. Four sets of plans must be submitted with the 
application, on which the location of the work and the essential 
features covered by the application will be outlined in red. Each 
drawing must have a simple title, date and number, preferably in the 
lower righthand corner.
    (h) Size of sheets. The drawings will be on letter size sheets. As 
few sheets will be used as necessary to show clearly what is proposed.
    (i) Special instructions. (1) The scale will be shown graphically. 
The north and south line will be indicated by a meridian arrow. 
Soundings and elevations will be shown in feet and referred to the 
established Government datum plane at the locality.
    (2) The direction of currents will be indicated by an arrow, and the 
strength of currents, both ebb and flow, or low water and high water, 
will be shown close to the proposed location of the bridge, and at both 
ends of the waterway shown on the map of location.
    (3) The plans will show in figures the least clear height of the 
lowest part of the superstructure over navigation openings, with 
reference to the planes of mean high water and mean low water if the 
bridge is to cross tidal water. If the waters are nontidal, the least 
clear height will be shown with reference to the planes of extreme high 
water and mean low water. If records of river heights are available, the 
plane above which flood waters have not remained more than 2 percent of 
the time will be indicated. Reference will also be made to other datum 
planes if appropriate for the waterway in question.
    (4) If harbor lines have been established at the site of the bridge, 
their position will be shown on the plans.
    (j) Structural details. Only those should be shown which are needed 
to illustrate the effect of the proposed structure on navigation. If the

Sec. 115.60  Procedures for handling applications for bridge construction permits.

    The following procedures will be observed in the handling of 
applications for permits to construct, modify, or replace bridges over 
navigable waters.
    (a) District Commander's review of application and plans. When an 
application is received, the District Commander verifies the authority 
for construction of the bridge, reviews, the application and plans for 
sufficiency, ascertains the views of local authorities and other 
interested parties, and ensures that the application complies with 
relevant environmental laws, regulations, and orders. If the application 
contains any defects that would prevent issuance of a permit (as for 
example, if the proposed bridge provided insufficient clearance), the 
applicant is notified that the permit cannot be granted and given 
reasons for this determination. The applicant may then request that the 
application be considered by the Commandant. If the applicant makes such 
a request, or if the applicaton is not found defective, the District 
Commander notifies the public that it has been received and continues 
its processing. A copy of this notification will be sent to the state, 
interstate agency or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
responsible for acting on requests for water quality certification for 
the project. If the state, interstate agency, or the EPA fails to issue 
or deny the water quality certification within 30 days after receiving 
the copy of this notification, the requirements for a water quality 
certification are waived. If the appropriate agency notifies the 
District Commander that the applicant has not filed a request for water 
quality certification, or requests additional time to review an 
application, additional time will be granted.
    (b) Public hearing. (1) Public hearings will be held when there are 
substantial issues concerning the effect that the proposed bridge will 
have on the reasonable needs of navigation.
    (2) Notice of the public hearing will be published in the Federal 
Register. Notice of the hearing is also mailed to State, county, and 
municipal authorities and all other known interested parties. It is also 
posted at the post office nearest the site and public places in the 
vicinity.
    (3) Hearings are public and conducted in an informal manner. A 
designated Coast Guard official presides. The submission of written 
statements is invited and encouraged. Anyone desiring to do so may 
speak. Statements, written or oral, are not under oath, and cross-
examination is not permitted. No fixed order has been established for 
the presentation of evidence or argument although proponents are 
generally heard first, followed by opponents with full opportunity 
afforded for rebuttals.
    (c) Report and recommendations. After the close of the comment 
period and any public hearings, a detailed statement of findings, 
conclusions, and recommendations based on all available information 
(including Coast Guard records and experience) is prepared. The 
following factors may be discussed in this report:
    (1) Comparison of proposed bridge with existing bridges over the 
waterway; attitude of local authorities; summary of objections raised by 
the public, and District Commander's comments or responses; probable 
effect on navigation, present and prospective.
    (2) Description of the navigation on the waterway past the site of 
the proposed bridge, the number and type of vessels, the number of 
vessel trips, and the principal method of handling traffic, whether in 
single vessels or in tows.
    (3) Whether the District Commander approves, or recommends approval 
of the plans. If they are found objectionable, the reasons for this 
finding will be stated. If there are objectionable features in the plans 
which may be corrected, the applicant is given an opportunity to revise 
them. If approval is given or recommended, all conditions to which the 
permit should be subject will be stated.
    (d) Action on permit application. (1) The District Commander may 
issue the

[[Page 435]]

permit if authorized under Sec. 1.01-60(b) of this chapter; otherwise, a 
report with the application shall be submitted to the Commandant for 
final action.
    (2) When an application is approved, the issuing official signs the 
permit and transmits it to the applicant.
    (3) When an application is not approved, the applicant is notified 
and provided with reasons for the disapproval, and suggestions for 
modifications that would justify reconsideration, if appropriate.
    (4) If an application is disapproved by the District Commander, the 
applicant may appeal this decision to the Commandant under Sec. 114.50 
of this chapter. The Commandant's determination shall constitute final 
agency action.
    (e) Permit amendments. Applications for amendments to permits will 
be processed in the same manner as permit applications. The District 
Commander may approve amendments to any permits which that official is 
authorized to issue under Sec. 1.01-60(b) of this chapter. All other 
amendments must be approved by the Commandant.

Sec. 115.70  Advance approval of bridges.

    (a) The General Bridge Act of 1946 requires the approval of the 
location and plans of bridges prior to start of construction (33 U.S.C. 
525). The Commandant has given his advance approval to the location and 
plans of bridges to be constructed across reaches of waterways navigable 
in law, but not actually navigated other than by logs, log rafts, 
rowboats, canoes and small motorboats. In such cases the clearances 
provided for high water stages will be considered adequate to meet the 
reasonable needs of navigation.
    (b) The term ``small motorboats'' shall be interpreted in the light 
of the things and conditions with which it is associated. The term means 
rowboats, canoes and other similar craft with outboard motors. It does 
not include sailing or cabin cruiser craft.

<R05>
Sec. 116.01  General.

    (a) All bridges are obstructions to navigation and are tolerated 
only as long as they serve the needs of land transportation while 
allowing for the reasonable needs of navigation.
    (b) This part describes the general procedures by which the U.S. 
Coast Guard determines a bridge to be an unreasonable obstruction to 
navigation and issues an Order to Alter under the authority of the 
following statutes, as appropriate: Section 18 of the Rivers and Harbors 
Appropriations Act of 1899, 33 U.S.C. 502; Section 4 of the Bridge Act 
of 1906, 33 U.S.C. 494; or the Truman-Hobbs Act of 1940, as amended, 33 
U.S.C. 511-524.
    (c) A bridge constructed across a navigable water of the United 
States shall not unreasonably obstruct the free navigation of the water 
over which it was constructed, either due to insufficient height or 
width of the navigation

[[Page 436]]

span, or because of difficulty in passing through the draw opening. If 
any bridge unreasonably obstructs navigation, the Commandant, U.S. Coast 
Guard, will order the alteration of that bridge. Alterations may include 
structural changes, replacement, or removal of the bridge.
    (d) Whenever the Coast Guard has good reason to believe that a 
bridge across any of the navigable waters of the United States is an 
unreasonable obstruction to navigation, the Coast Guard will give notice 
to the owner of the bridge and other interested parties, and hold a 
public hearing at which the interested parties will have a full 
opportunity to be heard and to offer evidence on the question of whether 
alterations to the bridge are necessary and, if so, the extent of 
alterations needed.
    (e) If the Coast Guard determines that alterations to a bridge are 
necessary, the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, will issue to the bridge 
owner an Order to Alter containing details of the alterations necessary 
to render navigation through or under the bridge reasonably free, easy, 
and unobstructed.
    (1) In the case of a railroad or publicly owned highway bridge, an 
Order to Alter is issued to the bridge owner under the provisions of the 
Truman-Hobbs Act (33 U.S.C. 511 et seq.). In ordering these alterations, 
the Coast Guard will give due regard to the necessities of free and 
unobstructed navigation and of rail and highway traffic. For alterations 
to bridges governed by the Truman-Hobbs Act, the Coast Guard must 
approve general plans, specifications, and contracts for the alteration 
project, as well as approving the apportionment of the total cost of the 
alterations between the United States and the bridge owner.
    (2) For all other bridges, the Order to Alter will contain the 
required alterations for the bridge and will prescribe a reasonable time 
in which to accomplish the required alterations. The bridge owner is 
responsible for the entire cost of the required alterations.


<R05>
Sec. 116.05  Complaints.

    Any person, company, or other entity may submit to the District 
Commander of the Coast Guard district in which a bridge over a navigable 
water of the United States is located, a complaint that a bridge 
unreasonably obstructs navigation. The complaint must be in writing and 
include specific details to support the allegation.


<R05>
Sec. 116.10  Preliminary review.

    (a) Upon receipt of a written complaint, the District Commander will 
review the complaint to determine if, in the District Commander's 
opinion, the complaint is justified and whether a Preliminary 
Investigation is warranted.
    (1) The District Commander's opinion as to whether or not the 
complaint warrants a Preliminary Investigation will be formed through 
informal discussions with the complainant, users of the affected 
waterway, the owner of the bridge, and other interested parties.
    (2) In forming an opinion, the District Commander may also review 
the district files, records of accidents, and details of any additional 
written complaints associated with the bridge in question.
    (b) In the absence of any written complaint, the District Commander 
may decide, based on a bridge's accident history or other criteria, to 
conduct a Preliminary Investigation.
    (c) The District Commander will inform the complainant and the 
Chief, Office of Bridge Administration of the determination of any 
Preliminary Review. If the District Commander decides that the bridge in 
question is not an unreasonable obstruction to navigation, the 
complainant will be provided with a brief summary of the information on 
which the District Commander based the decision and will be informed of 
the appeal process described in Sec. 116.55. There will be no further 
investigation, unless additional information warrants a continuance or 
reopening of the case.

33663, June 28, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 116.15  Preliminary investigation.

    (a) During the Preliminary Investigation, the District Commander 
will prepare a written report containing all pertinent information and 
submit the

[[Page 437]]

report, together with a recommendation for or against the necessity of a 
Detailed Investigation, to the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration.
    (b) The Preliminary Investigation Report will include a description 
of the nature and extent of the obstruction, the alterations to the 
bridge believed necessary to meet the reasonable needs of existing and 
future navigation, the type and volume of waterway traffic, and a 
calculation of the benefits to navigation which would result from the 
proposed bridge alterations.
    (c) The Chief, Office of Bridge Administration will review the 
Preliminary Investigation Report and make a Preliminary Decision whether 
or not to undertake a Detailed Investigation and a Public Hearing.
    (d) If after reviewing the Preliminary Investigation Report, the 
Chief, Office of Bridge Administration decides that further 
investigation is not warranted, the complainant will be notified of the 
decision. This notification will include a brief summary of information 
on which the decision was based and details of the appeal process 
described in Sec. 116.55.

[CGD 91-063, 60 FR 20902, Apr. 28, 1995, as amended by CGD 96-026, 61 FR 
33663, June 28, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 116.20  Detailed investigation.

    (a) When the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration determines that 
a Detailed Investigation should be conducted, the District Commander 
will initiate an investigation that addresses all of the pertinent data 
regarding the bridge, including information obtained at a public hearing 
held under Sec. 116.25. As part of the investigation, the District 
Commander will develop a comprehensive report, termed the ``Detailed 
Investigation Report'', which will discuss: the obstructive character of 
the bridge in question; the impact of that bridge upon navigation; 
navigational benefits derived; whether an alteration is needed to meet 
the needs of navigation; and, if alteration is recommended, what type.
    (b) The District Commander will forward the completed Detailed 
Investigation Report to the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration for 
review together with a recommendation of whether the bridge should be 
declared an unreasonable obstruction to navigation and, if so, whether 
an Order to Alter should be issued.

[CGD 91-063, 60 FR 20902, Apr. 28, 1995, as amended by CGD 96-026, 61 FR 
33663, June 28, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 116.25  Public hearings.

    (a) Any time the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration determines 
that a Detailed Investigation is warranted, or when Congress declares a 
bridge unreasonably obstructive, the District Commander will hold a 
public hearing near the location of the bridge to provide the bridge 
owner, waterway users, and other interested parties the opportunity to 
offer evidence and be heard, orally or in writing, as to whether any 
alterations are necessary to provide reasonably free, safe, and 
unobstructed passage for waterborne traffic. The District Commander will 
issue a public notice announcing the public hearing stating the time, 
date, and place of the hearing.
    (b) When a bridge is statutorily determined to be an unreasonable 
obstruction, the scope of the hearing will be to determine what 
navigation clearances are needed.
    (c) In all other cases, the scope of the hearing will be to address 
issues bearing on the question of whether the bridge is an unreasonable 
obstruction to navigation and, if so, what alterations are needed.
    (d) The hearing will be recorded. Copies of the public hearing 
transcript will be available for purchase from the recording service.

[CGD 91-063, 60 FR 20902, Apr. 28, 1995, as amended by CGD 96-026, 61 FR 
33664, June 28, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 116.30  Chief, Office of Bridge Administration Review and Evaluation.

    (a) Upon receiving a Detailed Investigation Report from a District 
Commander, the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration will review all 
the information and make a final determination of whether or not the 
bridge is an unreasonable obstruction to navigation and, if so, whether 
to issue an Order to Alter. This determination will be accompanied by a 
supporting written Decision Analysis which will include a

[[Page 438]]

Benefit/Cost Analysis, including calculation of a Benefit/Cost Ratio.
    (b) The Benefit/Cost ratio is calculated by dividing the annualized 
navigation benefit of the proposed bridge alteration by the annualized 
government share of the cost of the alteration.
    (c) Except for a bridge which is statutorily determined to be an 
unreasonable obstruction, an Order to Alter will not be issued under the 
Truman-Hobbs Act unless the ratio is at least 1:1.
    (d) If a bridge is statutorily determined to unreasonably obstruct 
navigation, the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration will prepare a 
Decision Analysis to document and provide details of the required 
vertical and horizontal clearances and the reasons alterations are 
necessary.
    (e) If the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration decides to 
recommend that the Commandant issue an Order to Alter, or a bridge is 
statutorily determined to unreasonably obstruct navigation, the Chief, 
Office of Bridge Administration will issue a letter to the bridge owner 
(``The 60-Day Letter'') at least 60 days before the Commandant issues an 
Order to Alter. This letter will contain the reasons an alteration is 
necessary, the proposed alteration, and, in the case of a Truman-Hobbs 
bridge, an estimate of the total project cost and the bridge owner's 
share.
    (f) If the bridge owner does not agree with the terms proposed in 
the 60-Day Letter, the owner may request a reevaluation of the terms. 
The request for a reevaluation must be in writing, and identify the 
terms for which reevaluation is requested. The request may provide 
additional information not previously presented.
    (g) Upon receipt of the bridge owner's response, the Chief, Office 
of Bridge Administration will reevaluate the situation based on the 
additional information submitted by the bridge owner. If after the 
Chief, Office of Bridge Administration reviews the determination, there 
is no change, the Commandant may issue an Order to Alter as set out in 
Sec. 116.35. The Chief, Office of Bridge Administration determination 
based on the reevaluation will constitute final agency action.

[CGD 91-063, 60 FR 20902, Apr. 28, 1995, as amended by CGD 96-026, 61 FR 
33664, June 28, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 116.35  Order to Alter.

    (a) If the bridge owner agrees with the contents of the 60-Day 
Letter, if no reply is received by 60 days after the issuance of the 
letter, or if after reevaluation a bridge is determined to be an 
unreasonable obstruction to navigation, the Commandant will issue an 
Order to Alter.
    (1) If a bridge is eligible for funding under the Truman-Hobbs Act, 
the Order to Alter will specify the navigational clearances to be 
accomplished in order to meet the reasonable needs of navigation.
    (2) An Order to Alter for a bridge that is not eligible for Truman-
Hobbs funding will specify the navigational clearances that are required 
to meet the reasonable needs of navigation and will prescribe a 
reasonable time in which to accomplish them.
    (b) If appropriate, the Order to Alter will be accompanied by a 
letter of special conditions setting forth safeguards needed to protect 
the environment or to provide for any special needs of navigation.
    (c) If a proposed alteration to a bridge has desirable, non-
navigational benefits, the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration may 
require an equitable contribution from any interested person, firm, 
association, corporation, municipality, county, or state benefiting from 
the alteration as a prerequisite to the making of an Order to Alter for 
that alteration.
    (d) Failure to comply with any Order to Alter issued under the 
provisions of this part will subject the owner or controller of the 
bridge to the penalties prescribed in 33 U.S.C. 495, 502, 519, or any 
other applicable provision.

[CGD 91-063, 60 FR 20902, Apr. 28, 1995, as amended by CGD 96-026, 61 FR

<R05>
Sec. 116.40  Plans and specifications under the Truman-Hobbs Act.

    (a) After an Order to Alter has been issued to a bridge owner under 
the Truman-Hobbs Act, the Chief, Office of

[[Page 439]]

Bridge Administration will issue a letter to the bridge owner outlining 
the owner's responsibilities to submit plans and specifications to the 
Chief, Office of Bridge Administration for the alteration of the bridge. 
The plans and specifications, at a minimum, must provide for the 
clearances identified in the Order to Alter. The plans and 
specifications may also include any other additional alteration to the 
bridge that the owner considers desirable to meet the requirements of 
railroad or highway traffic. During the alteration process, balanced 
consideration shall be given to the needs of rail, highway, and marine 
traffic.
    (b) The Chief, Office of Bridge Administration will approve or 
reject the plans and specifications submitted by the bridge owner, in 
whole or in part, and may require the submission of new or additional 
plans and specifications.
    (c) When Chief, Office of Bridge Administration has approved the 
submitted plans and specifications, they are final and binding upon all 
parties, unless later changes are approved by the Chief, Office of 
Bridge Administration. Any changes to the approved plans will be 
coordinated with the District Commander.

<R05>
Sec. 116.45  Submission of bids, approval of award, guaranty of cost, and partial payments for bridges eligible for funding under the Truman-Hobbs Act.

    (a) Once the plans and specifications for a bridge eligible for 
funding under the Truman-Hobbs Act have been approved, the bridge owner 
must take bids for the alteration of the bridge consistent with the 
approved plans and specifications. Those bids must then be submitted to 
the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration for approval.
    (b) After the bridge owner submits the guaranty of cost required by 
33 U.S.C. 515, the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration authorizes the 
owner to award the contract.
    (c) Partial payments of the government's costs are authorized as the 
work progresses to the extent that funds have been appropriated.

[CGD 91-063, 60 FR 20902, Apr. 28, 1995, as amended by CGD 96-026, 61 FR 
33664, June 28, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 116.50  Apportionment of costs under the Truman-Hobbs Act.

    (a) In determining the apportionment of costs, the bridge owner must 
bear such part of the cost attributable to the direct and special 
benefits which will accrue to the bridge owner as a result of alteration 
to the bridge, including expected savings in repairs and maintenance, 
expected increased carrying capacity, costs attributable to the 
requirements of highway and railroad traffic, and actual capital costs 
of the used service life. The United States will bear the balance of the 
costs, including that part attributable to the necessities of 
navigation.
    (b) ``Direct and special benefits'' ordinarily will include items 
desired by the owner but which have no counterpart or are of higher 
quality than similar items in the bridge prior to alteration. Examples 
include improved signal and fender systems, pro rata share of 
dismantling costs, and improvements included, but not required, in the 
interests of navigation.
    (c) During the development of the Apportionment of Costs, the bridge 
owner will be provided with an opportunity to be heard. Proportionate 
shares of cost to be borne by the United States and the bridge owner are 
developed in substantially the following form:

Total cost of project ________ $________
    Less salvage ________ $________
    Less contribution by third party ________ $________
Cost of alteration to be apportioned ________ $________
Share to be borne by the bridge owner:
Direct and Special Benefits:
    a. Removing old bridge ________ $________
    b. Fixed charges ________ $________
    c. Betterments ________ $________
Expected savings in repair or maintenance costs:
    a. Repair ________ $________
    b. Maintenance ________ $________
Costs attributable to requirements of railroad and/or highway traffic 
          ________ $________
Expenditure for increased carrying capacity ________ $________

Sec. 116.55  Appeals.

    (a) Except for the decision to issue an Order to Alter, if a 
complainant disagrees with a recommendation regarding obstruction or 
eligibility made by a District Commander, or the Chief, Office of Bridge 
Administration, the complainant may appeal that decision to the 
Assistant Commandant for Operations.
    (b) The appeal must be submitted in writing to the Assistant 
Commandant for Operations, U.S. Coast Guard, 2100 Second Street, SW., 
Washington, DC 20593-0001, within 60 days after the District Commander's 
or the Chief's, Office of Bridge Administration decision. The Assistant 
Commandant for Operations will make a decision on the appeal within 90 
days after receipt of the appeal. The Assistant Commandant for 
Operations' decision of this appeal shall constitute final agency 
action.
    (c) Any Order of Apportionment made or issued under section 6 of the 
Truman-Hobbs Act, 33 U.S.C. 516, may be reviewed by the Court of Appeals 
for any judicial circuit in which the bridge in question is wholly or 
partly located, if a petition for review is filed within 90 days after 
the date of issuance of the order. The review is described in section 10 
of the Truman-Hobbs Act, 33 U.S.C. 520. The review proceedings do not 
operate as a stay of any order issued under the Truman-Hobbs Act, other 
than an order of apportionment, nor relieve any bridge owner of any 
liability or penalty under other provisions of that act.

<R04>
                     Subpart A--General Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 117.1  Purpose.

    This subpart prescribes general requirements relating to the use and 
operation of drawbridges across the navigable waters of the United 
States.
    Note: The primary jurisdiction to regulate drawbridges across the 
navigable waters of the United States is vested in the Federal 
Government. Laws, ordinances, regulations, and rules which purport to 
regulate these bridges and which are not promulgated by the Federal 
Government have no force and effect.


<R05>
Sec. 117.3  Applicability.

    The provisions of this subpart not in conflict with the provisions 
of Subpart B apply to each drawbridge.
    Note: For all of the requirements applicable to a drawbridge listed 
in Subpart B, one must review the requirements in Subpart A and 
Secs. 117.51 through 117.99 of Subpart B, as well as the requirements in 
Subpart B applicable to the particular drawbridge in question.


<R05>
Sec. 117.4  Definitions.

    Certain terms used in this part are defined in this section.
    Appurtenance. The term ``appurtenance'' means an attachment or 
accessory extending beyond the hull or superstructure that is not an 
integral part of the vessel and is not needed for a vessel's piloting, 
propelling, controlling, or collision avoidance capabilities.
    Lowerable. The term ``lowerable'' means the nonstructural vessel 
appurtenance can be mechanically or manually lowered and raised again. 
The term ``lowerable'' also applies to a nonstructural vessel 
appurtenance which can be modified to make the item flexible, hinged, 
collapsible, or telescopic such that it can be mechanically or manually 
lowered and raised again. Failure to make the modification is considered 
equivalent to refusing to lower a lowerable nonstructural appurtenance 
that is not essential to navigation. Examples of appurtenances which are 
considered to be lowerable include, but are not limited to, fishing 
outriggers, radio antennae, television antennae, false stacks, and masts 
purely for ornamental purposes. Examples of appurtenances which are not 
considered to be lowerable include, but are not limited to, radar 
antennae, flying bridges, sailboat masts, piledriver leads, spud frames 
on hydraulic dredges, drilling derricks' substructures and buildings, 
cranes on drilling or construction vessels, or other items of permanent 
and fixed equipment.
    Nonstructural. The term ``nonstructural'' means that the item is not 
rigidly fixed to the vessel and is thus susceptible to relocation or 
alteration.
    Not essential to navigation. The term ``not essential to 
navigation'' means the nonstructural vessel appurtenance does not 
adversely affect the vessel's piloting, propulsion, control, or 
collision avoidance capabilities when in the lowered position.

[[Page 446]]


<R05>
Sec. 117.5  When the draw shall open.

    Except as otherwise required by this subpart, drawbridges shall open 
promptly and fully for the passage of vessels when a request to open is 
given in accordance with this subpart.

    Editorial Note: For Federal Register citations relating to temporary 
deviations from the regulatory provisions in Sec. 117.5, see the List of 
CFR Sections Affected in the Finding Aids section of this volume.


<R05>
Sec. 117.7  General duties of drawbridge owners and tenders.

    (a) Drawbridge owners and tenders shall operate the draw in 
accordance with the requirement in this part.
    (b) Except for drawbridges not required to open for the passage of 
vessels, owners of drawbridges shall ensure that:
    (1) The necessary drawtenders are provided for the safe and prompt 
opening of the draw;
    (2) The operating machinery of the draw is maintained in a 
serviceable condition; and.
    (3) The draws are operated at sufficient intervals to assure their 
satisfactory operation.


<R05>
Sec. 117.9  Delaying opening of a draw.

    No person shall unreasonably delay the opening of a draw after the 
signals required by Sec. 117.15 have been given.
    Note: Trains are usually controlled by the block method. That is, 
the track is divided into blocks or segments of a mile or more in 
length. When a train is in a block with a drawbridge, the draw may not 
be able to open until the train has passed out of the block and the 
yardmaster or other manager has ``unlocked'' the drawbridge controls. 
The maximum time permitted for delay is defined in Subpart B for each 
affected bridge. Land and water traffic should pass over or through the 
draw as soon as possible in order to prevent unnecessary delays in the 
opening and closure of the draw.


<R05>
Sec. 117.11  Unnecessary opening of the draw.

    No vessel owner or operator shall--
    (a) Signal a drawbridge to open if the vertical clearance is 
sufficient to allow the vessel, after all lowerable nonstructural vessel 
appurtenances that are not essential to navigation have been lowered, to 
safely pass under the drawbridge in the closed position; or
    (b) Signal a drawbridge to open for any purpose other than to pass 
through the drawbridge opening.

[CGD 91-059, 59 FR 16563, Apr. 7, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 117.15  Signals.

    (a) General. (1) The operator of each vessel requesting a drawbridge 
to open shall signal the drawtender and the drawtender shall acknowledge 
that signal. The signal shall be repeated until acknowledged in some 
manner by the drawtender before proceeding.
    (2) The signals used to request the opening of the draw and to 
acknowledge that request shall be sound signals, visual signals, or 
radiotelephone communications described in this subpart.
    (3) Any of the means of signaling described in this subpart 
sufficient to alert the party being signaled may be used.
    (b) Sound signals. (1) Sound signals shall be made by whistle, horn, 
megaphone, hailer, or other device capable of producing the described 
signals loud enough to be heard by the drawtender.
    (2) As used in this section, ``prolonged blast'' means a blast of 
four to six seconds duration and ``short blast'' means a blast of 
approximately one second duration.
    (3) The sound signal to request the opening of a draw is one 
prolonged blast followed by one short blast sounded not more than three 
seconds after the prolonged blast. For vessels required to be passed 
through a draw during a scheduled closure period, the sound signal to 
request the opening of the draw during that period is five short blasts 
sounded in rapid succession.
    (4) When the draw can be opened immediately, the sound signal to 
acknowledge a request to open the draw is one prolonged blast followed 
by one short blast sounded not more than 30 seconds after the requesting 
signal.
    (5) When the draw cannot be opened immediately, or is open and shall 
be closed promptly, the sound signal to acknowledge a request to open 
the draw is five short blasts sounded in rapid succession not more than 
30 seconds after the vessel's opening signal.

[[Page 447]]

The signal shall be repeated until acknowledged in some manner by the 
requesting vessel.
    (c) Visual signals. (1) The visual signal to request the opening of 
a draw is--
    (i) A white flag raised and lowered vertically; or
    (ii) A white, amber, or green light raised and lowered vertically.
    (2) When the draw can be opened immediately, the visual signal to 
acknowledge a request to open the draw, given not more than 30 seconds 
after the vessel's opening signal, is--
    (i) A white flag raised and lowered vertically;
    (ii) A white, amber, or green light raised and lowered vertically; 
or
    (iii) A fixed or flashing white, amber, or green light or lights.
    (3) When the draw cannot be opened immediately, or is open and must 
be closed promptly, the visual signal to acknowledge a request to open 
the draw is--
    (i) A red flag or red light swung back and forth horizontally in 
full sight of the vessel given not more than 30 seconds after the 
vessel's opening signal; or
    (ii) A fixed or flashing red light or lights given not more than 30 
seconds after the vessel's opening signal.
    (4) The acknowledging signal when the draw cannot open immediately 
or is open and must be closed promptly shall be repeated until 
acknowledged in some manner by the requesting vessel.
    (d) Radio telephone communications. (1) Radiotelephones may be used 
to communicate the same information provided by sound and visual 
signals.
    Note: Call signs and radio channels for drawbridges with 
radiotelephones are listed in Appendix A to this part.
    (2) The vessel and the drawtender shall monitor the frequency used 
until the vessel has cleared the draw.
    (3) When radiotelephone contact cannot be initiated or maintained, 
sound or visual signals under this section shall be used.

[CGD 82-025, 49 FR 17452, Apr. 24, 1984, as amended by CGD 82-025, 50 FR 
11366, Mar. 21, 1985; CGD 84-022, 51 FR 16308, May 2, 1986; CGD 96-026, 
61 FR 33664, June 28, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 117.17  Signalling for contiguous drawbridges.

    When a vessel must past two or more drawbridges close together, the 
opening signal is given for the first bridge. After acknowledgment from 
the first bridge that it will promptly open, the opening signal is given 
for the second bridge, and so on until all bridges that the vessel must 
pass have been given the opening signal and have acknowledged that they 
will open promptly.


<R05>
Sec. 117.19  Signalling when two or more vessels are approaching a drawbridge.

    When two or more vessels are approaching the same drawbridge at the 
same time, or nearly the same, time, whether from the same or opposite 
directions, each vessel shall signal independently for the opening of 
the draw and the drawtender shall reply in turn to the signal of each 
vessel. The drawtender need not reply to signals by vessels accumulated 
at the bridge for passage during a scheduled open period.


<R05>
Sec. 117.21  Signalling for an opened drawbridge.

    When a vessel approaches a drawbridge with the draw in the open 
position, the vessel shall give the opening signal. If no acknowledgment 
is received within 30 seconds, the vessel may proceed, with caution, 
through the open draw.


<R05>
Sec. 117.23  Installation of radiotelephones.

    (a) When the District Commander deems it necessary for reasons of 
safety of navigation, the District Commander may require the 
installation and operation or a radiotelephone on or near a drawbridge.
    (b) The District Commander gives written notice of the proposed 
requirement to the bridge owner.
    (c) All comments the owner wishes to submit shall be submitted to 
the District Commander within 30 days of receipt of the notice under 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) If, upon consideration of the comments received, the District 
Commander determines that a radiotelephone is necessary, the District 
Commander notifies the bridge owner

[[Page 448]]

that a radiotelephone shall be installed and gives a reasonable time, 
not to exceed six months, to install the radiotelephone and commence 
operation.


<R05>
Sec. 117.24  Radiotelephone installation identification.

    (a) The Coast Guard authorizes, and the District Commander may 
require the installation of a sign on drawbridges, on the upstream and 
downstream sides, indicating that the bridge is equipped with and 
operates a VHF radiotelephone in accordance with Sec. 117.23.
    (b) The sign shall give notice of the radiotelephone and its calling 
and working channels--
    (1) In plain language; or
    (2) By a sign consisting of the outline of a telephone handset with 
the long axis placed horizontally and a vertical three-legged lightning 
slash superimposed over the handset. The slash shall be as long 
vertically as the handset is wide horizontally and normally not less 
than 27 inches and no more than 36 inches long. The preferred calling 
channel should be shown in the lower left quadrant and the preferred 
working channel should be shown in the lower right quadrant.
    Note: It is recommended that the radiotelephone sign be similar in 
design to the Service Signs established by the Federal Highway 
Administration (FHWA) in U.S. Road Symbol Signs using Reflective Blue 
and Reflective White colors. Color and design information is available 
from the District Commander of the Coast Guard District in which the 
bridge is located.

<R05>
Sec. 117.31  Operation of draw for emergency situations.

    (a) When a drawtender is informed by a reliable source that an 
emergency vehicle is due to cross the draw, the drawtender shall take 
all reasonable measures to have the draw closed at the time the 
emergency vehicle arrives at the bridge.
    (b) When a drawtender receives notice, or a proper signal as 
provided in Sec. 117.15 of this part, the drawtender shall take all 
reasonable measures to have the draw opened, regardless of the operating 
schedule of the draw, for passage of the following, provided this 
opening does not conflict with local emergency management procedures 
which have been approved by the cognizant Coast Guard Captain of the 
Port:
    (1) Federal, State, and local government vessels used for public 
safety;
    (2) Vessels in distress where a delay would endanger life or 
property;
    (3) Commercial vessels engaged in rescue or emergency salvage 
operations; and
    (4) Vessels seeking shelter from severe weather.

[CGD 91-016, 58 FR 20, Jan. 4, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 117.33  Closure of draw for natural disasters or civil disorders.

    Drawbridges need not open for the passage of vessels during periods 
of natural disasters or civil disorders declared by the appropriate 
authorities unless otherwise provided for in Subpart B or directed to do 
so by the District Commander.


<R05>
Sec. 117.35  Operations during repair or maintenance.

    (a) When operation of the draw must deviate from the regulations in 
this part for scheduled repair or maintenance work, the drawbridge owner 
shall request approval from the District Commander at least 30 days 
before the date of the intended change. The request shall include a 
brief description of the nature of the work to be performed and the 
times and dates of requested changes. The District Commander's decision 
is forwarded to the applicant within five working days of the receipt of 
the request. If the request is denied, the reasons for the denial are 
forwarded with the decision.
    (b) When the draw is rendered inoperative because of damage to the 
structure or when vital, unscheduled repair or maintenance work shall be 
performed without delay, the drawbridge owner shall immediately notify 
the District Commander and give the reasons why the draw is or should be 
rendered inoperative and the expected date of completion of the repair 
or maintenance work.
    (c) All repair or maintenance work under this section shall be 
performed with all due speed in order to return the draw to operation as 
soon as possible.

[[Page 449]]

    (d) If the operation of the draw will be affected for periods of 
less than 60 days, the regulations in this part will not be amended. 
Where practicable, the District Commander publishes notice of the 
temporary deviations from the regulations in this part in the Federal 
Register and Local Notices to Mariners. If operation of the draw is 
expected to be affected for more than 60 days, the District Commander 
publishes temporary regulations covering the repair period.


<R05>
Sec. 117.37  Opening or closure of draw for public interest concerns.

    (a) For reasons of public health or safety or for public functions, 
such as street parades and marine regattas, the District Commander may 
authorize the opening or closure of a drawbridge for a specified period 
of time.
    (b) Requests for opening or closure of a draw shall be submitted to 
the District Commander at least 30 days before the proposed opening or 
closure and include a brief description of the proposed event or other 
reason for the request, the reason why the opening or closure is 
required, and the times and dates of the period the draw is to remain 
open or closed.
    (c) Approval by the District Commander depends on the necessity for 
the opening or closure, the reasonableness of the times and dates, and 
the overall effect on navigation and users of the bridge.


<R05>
Sec. 117.39  Closure of draw due to infrequent use.

    Upon written request by the owner or operator of a drawbridge, the 
District Commander may, after notice in the Federal Register and 
opportunity for public comment, permit the draw to be closed and 
untended due to infrequency of use of the draw by vessels. The District 
Commander may condition approval on the continued maintenance of the 
operating machinery.


<R05>
Sec. 117.41  Maintenance of draw in fully open position.

    The draw may be maintained in the fully open position to permit the 
passage of vessels and drawtender service discontinued if the District 
Commander is notified in advance. The draw shall remain in the fully 
open position until drawtender service is restored or authorization 
under Sec. 117.39 is given for the draw to remain closed and untended.


<R05>
Sec. 117.43  Changes in draw operation requirements for regulatory purposes.

    In order to evaluate suggested changes to the drawbridge operation 
requirements, the District Commander may authorize temporary deviations 
from the regulations in this part for periods not to exceed 90 days.

<R04>
                    Subpart B--Specific Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 117.51  Purpose.

    This subpart prescribes specific requirements relating to the 
operation of certain drawbridges.
    Note: The drawbridges under this subpart are listed by the waterway 
they cross and by the state in which they are located. Waterways are 
arranged alphabetically by state. The drawbridges listed under a 
waterway are generally arranged in order from the mouth of the waterway 
moving upstream. The drawbridges on the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway 
are listed from north to south and on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway 
from east to west.


<R05>

    (a) The requirements in this subpart apply to the bridges listed and 
are in addition to, or vary from, the general requirements in Subpart A.
    (b) A requirement in this subpart which varies from a general 
requirement in Subpart A supersedes the general requirement.
    (c) All other general requirements in Subpart A not at variance 
apply to the bridges listed in this subpart.
    (d) The draws of a number of the bridges listed in this subpart need 
not open for the passage of vessels during certain periods, however, 
this does not preclude the bridge owner from directing the drawtender to 
open the draw during these periods.


<R05>
Sec. 117.55  Posting of requirements.

    (a) The owner of each drawbridge under this subpart, other than 
removable span bridges, shall ensure that a sign summarizing the 
requirements in this subpart applicable to the bridge is posted both 
upstream and downstream of the bridge. The requirements to be posted 
need not include those in Subpart A or Secs. 117.51 through 117.99.
    (b) The signs shall be of sufficient size and so located as to be 
easily read at any time from an approaching vessel.
    (c) If advance notice is required to open the draw, the signs shall 
also state the name, address, and telephone number of the person to be 
notified.


<R05>
Sec. 117.57  Advance notice.

    Owners and tenders of drawbridges requiring advance notice to open 
shall use all reasonable means to open the draw at the requested time 
and give due regard to the possibility that a brief delay may be 
experienced by the vessel giving the advance notice.


<R05>
Sec. 117.59  Special requirements due to hazards.

    For the duration of occurrences hazardous to safety or navigation, 
such as floods, freshets, and damage to the bridge or fender system, the

Sec. 117.123  Arkansas Waterway-Automated Railroad Bridges.

    (a) Across the Arkansas River, the draw of the Cotton Belt Railroad 
(Rob Roy) Bridge, Mile 67.4, is maintained in the closed position and is 
remotely operated. The following signals shall be used:
    (1) The opening signal from the vessel for each of these bridges is 
three short blasts.
    (2) The acknowledging signal is flashing white lights visible 
upstream and downstream. When the operator of the vessel sights the 
acknowledging signal, one prolonged blast shall be sounded.
    (3) This signal is acknowledged by the bridge controller when the 
draw is to open by changing the flashing white lights to continuous 
white lights, and sounding one blast on a horn. When the span is fully 
raised to a maximum clearance of 52 feet, the navigation lights at mid 
channel change from red to green, indicating that the draw is ready for 
passage.
    (4) If the draw cannot open, flashing amber warning lights are 
flashed and four blasts are sounded, indicating that a train is 
approaching or that maintenance work is in progress.
    (5) The vessel shall acknowledge that there is a delay by sounding 
four short blasts.
    (6) When the draw opens (after the train crosses or when maintenance 
work permits), the amber lights are turned off, the continuous white 
lights turned on, and one blast sounded, to indicate the draw is ready 
for passage.
    (7) The vessel acknowledges with one blast and, after the draw is 
fully open, may proceed through the draw.
    (8) When the vessel clears the draw, the mid channel navigation 
light changes from green to red, the amber

[[Page 452]]

warning lights will flash, and, after one minute, the draw lowers and 
locks.
    (b) The draws of the Junction Railroad Bridge at mile 118.7 and the 
Baring Cross Railroad Bridge at mile 119.6, Arkansas River, at Little 
Rock, are maintained in the closed position and are remotely operated. 
The draw of the Rock Island Railroad Bridge at mile 118.2, Arkansas 
River, at Little Rock, is maintained in the open position. Use the 
following procedures to request opening of these bridges when necessary 
for transit;
    (1) Normal Flow Procedures. Any upbound or downbound vessel which 
requires opening the draw of any of these bridges shall establish 
contact by radiotelephone with the remote drawbridge operator on VHF-FM 
Channel 13 in North Little Rock, Arkansas. The remote drawbridge 
operator will advise the vessel whether the requested span can be 
immediately opened and maintain constant contact with the vessel until 
the requested span has opened and the vessel passage has been completed. 
If any or all of the drawbridges cannot be opened immediately, the 
remote drawbridge operator will notify the calling vessel and provide an 
estimated time for individual drawbridge openings.
    (2) High Velocity Flow Procedures. The area from mile 118.2 to mile 
125.4 is a regulated navigation area (RNA) as described in 33 CFR 
165.817. During periods of high velocity flow, which is defined as a 
flow rate of 70,000 cubic feet per second or greater at the Murray Lock 
and Dam, mile 125.4, downbound vessels which require that the draw of 
these three bridges be opened for unimpeded passage shall contact the 
remote drawbridge operator on VHF-FM Channel 13 either before departing 
Murray Lock and Dam, or before departing the mooring cells at Mile 121.5 
to ensure that the Rock Island, Junction, and Baring Cross Railroad 
drawbridges are opened. The remote drawbridge operator shall immediately 
respond to the vessel's call, ensure that all three drawbridges are open 
for pasage, and ensure that they remain in the open positon until the 
downbound vessel has passed through each drawbridge. If a closed 
drawbridge cannot be opened immediately for unimpeded passage in 
accordance with 33 CFR 163.203, the remote drawbridge operator will 
immediately notify the downbound vessel and provide an estimated time 
for drawbridge openings. Upbound vessels shall request openings in 
accordance with the normal flow procedures as set forth above. The 
remote drawbridge operator shall keep all approaching vessels informed 
of the position of the drawbridge spans.
    (c) The draw of the Arkansas Missouri Railroad Bridge, Mile 300.8 
Arkansas River at Van Buren, and the Missouri Pacific Railroad 
Drawbridge, Mile 7.5 Arkansas Waterway at Benzal, are maintained in the 
open position with a minimum vertical clearance of 52 feet except as 
follows:
    (1) When a train approaches either bridge, amber lights attached to 
the bridge begin to flash and an audible signal on the bridge sounds. At 
the end of 10 minutes, the amber light continues to flash; however, the 
audible signal stops and the draw lowers and locks if the photoelectric 
boat detection system detects no obstruction under the span. If there is 
an obstruction, the draw opens to its full height until obstruction is 
cleared.
    (2) After the train clears the bridge, the draw opens to its full 
height, the amber flashing light stops, and the mid channel lights 
change from red to green, indicating the navigation channel is open for 
the passage of vessels.

<R05>
Sec. 117.393  Illinois Waterway.

    (a) The draw of the automated Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad 
bridge, mile 88.8 at Beardstown, Illinois, operates as follows:
    (1) The draw is normally maintained in the fully open position, 
displaying a green light to indicate that vessels may pass.
    (2) When a vessel is approaching and the draw is in the open 
position, contact shall be established by radiotelephone with the remote 
operator to assure that the draw remains open until passage is complete.
    (3) When a vessel is approaching and the draw is in the closed 
position, contact shall be established by radiotelephone with the remote 
operator. If the draw cannot be opened immediately, alternate flashing 
red lights are displayed. If the draw can be opened immediately, 
flashing amber lights are displayed.
    (4) When a train approaches the bridge and the draw is in the open 
position, the operator shall activate alternate flashing red lights on 
top of the draw, sound four short blasts, and scan the river on radar to 
determine whether any vessel is approaching the bridge. The remote 
operator shall also broadcast that the draw is closing. If a vessel or 
vessels are approaching the bridge within one mile, as determined by 
radar scanning, response to radio broadcast, or electronic detector, the 
flashing red lights shall be changed to flashing amber and the operator 
shall keep the draw in the fully open position until the vessel or 
vessels have cleared the bridge. If no vessel is approaching the bridge 
or is beneath the draw, the draw may be lowered and locked in place.
    (5) After the train has cleared the bridge, the draw shall be raised 
to its full height and locked in place, the red flashing lights stopped, 
and the draw lights changed from red to green.
    (b) The draw of the Union Pacific railroad bridge, Mile 151.2, at 
Pekin, Illinois, is operated by a remote operator located at the Union 
Pacific offices in Chicago, Illinois, as follows:
    (1) The draw is normally maintained in the fully open position, 
displaying green mid-channel lights to indicate that the span is fully 
open.
    (2) The draw is equipped with the following:
    (i) A radiotelephone link direct to the remote operator;
    (ii) A horn for sound signals;
    (iii) Eight high intensity amber warning lights, oriented upstream 
and downstream, with two secured to the uppermost chord and two secured 
to the lowermost chord of the drawspan;
    (iv) A radar antenna on the lower portion of the drawspan capable of 
scanning one mile upstream and one mile downstream; and
    (v) Infrared scanners located on the upstream and downstream ends of 
the channel span piers, to detect vessels or other obstructions under 
the bridge.
    (3) The remote operator shall maintain a radiotelephone watch for 
mariners to establish contact as they approach the bridge to ensure that 
the draw is open or that it remains open until passage is complete.
    (4) When a train approaches the bridge and the draw is in the open 
position, the remote operator initiates a ten minute warning period 
before closing the bridge. During this warning period, the amber lights 
begin flashing and a signal of four short blasts sounds on a horn. The 
four-blast signal will repeat after a five second interval. A 
synthesized-voice message is broadcast over the radiotelephone as 
follows: ``The Union Pacific railroad bridge at Mile 151.2, Illinois 
River, will close to navigation in ten minutes.'' The announcement is 
repeated every two minutes, counting down the time remaining until 
closure.
    (5) At the end of the ten minute warning period, the remote bridge 
operator scans under the bridge using infrared detectors and the 
upstream and downstream approaches to the bridge using radar to 
determine whether any vessels are under or are approaching

[[Page 478]]

the bridge. If any vessels are under or are approaching the bridge 
within one mile as determined by infrared or radar scanning or by a 
radiotelephone response, the remote operator shall not close the bridge 
until the vessel or vessels have cleared the bridge.
    (6) If no vessels are under or approaching the bridge, the mid-
channel navigation lights will change from green to red, the horn signal 
of four short blasts will sound, twice, and the radiotelephone message 
will change to: ``The Union Pacific Railroad Bridge at Mile 151.2, 
Illinois River, is closed to navigation.'' The message will repeat every 
two minutes and the amber lights will continue to flash until the bridge 
is fully reopened.
    (7) If the infrared scanners detect a vessel or other obstruction 
under the bridge before the drawspan is fully lowered and locked, the 
closing sequence is stopped, automatically, and the drawspan is raised 
to its fully open position until the channel is clear. When obstruction 
has cleared the navigation span, the remote operator confirms that the 
channel is clear, and reinitiates the ten-minute warning cycle.
    (8) After the train has cleared the bridge, the remote operator 
initiates the lift span raising cycle. When the draw is raised to its 
full height and locked in place, the flashing lights stop and the mid-
channel navigation lights change from red to green. The synthesized 
voice announcement broadcasts at two minute intervals for ten minutes 
that the bridge is reopened to navigation.
    (c) The draws of the McDonough Street Bridge, mile 287.3; Jefferson 
Street bridge, mile 287.9; Cass Street bridge, mile 288.1; Jackson 
Street bridge, mile 288.4; and Ruby Street bridge, mile 288.7; all of 
Joliet, shall open on signal, except that they need not open from 7:30 
a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and from 4:15 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. Monday through 
Saturday.
    (d) The drawspan of the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway bridge, 
mile 290.1 at Lockport, Illinois, is operated by remote operator located 
at the Elgin, Joliet & Eastern offices in East Joliet, Illinois as 
follows:
    (1) The drawspan is normally maintained in the fully open to 
navigation position displaying green center span navigation lights to 
indicate that the drawspan is fully open.
    (2) The bridge is equipped with the following:
    (i) A radiotelephone link direct to the remote operator;
    (ii) A radar antenna on top of the drawspan capable of scanning the 
river, one mile upstream and one mile downstream;
    (iii) Infrared boat detectors under the drawspan, to allow the 
remote bridge operator to detect vessels under the drawspan;
    (iv) Electronic motion detectors under the drawspan to allow the 
remote bridge operator to detect vessel movement under the drawspan;
    (v) A siren for sound signals; and
    (vi) Red and green center span navigation lights.
    (3) The remote bridge operator shall maintain a 24 hour VHF marine 
radio watch for mariners to establish contact as they approach the 
bridge to ensure that the drawspan is open or that it remains open until 
passage of river traffic is complete.
    (4) When rail traffic approaches the bridge, and the drawspan is in 
the open position, the remote bridge operator initiates a one minute 
warning period before closing the drawspan. During this warning period, 
the remote operator shall broadcast at least twice, via marine radio, 
that: ``The drawspan of the EJ&E Railroad bridge will be lowered in one 
minute.'' A siren on the bridge sounds for 20 seconds, to warn anyone on 
or under the bridge that the drawspan will be lowered.
    (5) If a vessel is approaching the bridge upbound or, departing the 
Lockport Lock and Dam at mile 291.1, downbound, with intentions of 
passing through the drawspan, they shall respond to the remote bridge 
operators' marine radio broadcast, or initiate radio contact, indicating 
their proximity to the bridge and requesting an opening of the drawspan 
or that the drawspan remain open until the vessel passes. If any 
approaching vessel is detected or if a radiotelephone response is 
received, the remote operator shall not close the drawspan until the 
vessel or vessels have cleared the bridge.

[[Page 479]]

    (6) At the end of the one minute warning period, if no river traffic 
is approaching or under the drawspan, the remote bridge operator may 
begin lowering the drawspan. Navigation lights located at the center of 
the drawspan change from green to red when the drawspan is not in the 
fully open to navigation position. The drawspan takes approximately 90 
seconds to lower.
    (7) If the presence of a vessel or other obstruction is discovered 
approaching or under the drawspan, during the lowering sequence, before 
the drawspan is fully lowered and locked, the drawspan shall be stopped 
and raised to the fully open position. When the vessel or obstruction 
has cleared the drawspan, the remote operator shall confirm that the 
channel is clear and reinitiate the one minute warning cycle before 
lowering the drawspan.
    (8) If no marine traffic is present the drawspan may be lowered and 
seated. When the drawspan is lowered and locked in the closed to 
navigation position, the remote bridge operator periodically broadcasts, 
via marine radio, that: ``The drawspan of the EJ&E Railroad bridge is 
closed to navigation.''
    (9) Failure of the radar system, radio telephone system, infrared 
boat detectors or electronic motion sensors shall prevent lowering the 
drawspan from the remote location.
    (10) when rail traffic has cleared the bridge, the remote bridge 
operator shall raise the drawspan to the fully open to navigation 
position. When the drawspan is raised and in the fully open to 
navigation position, the remote bridge operator broadcasts, at least 
twice, via marine radio, that: ``The drawspan of the EJ&E Railroad 
bridge is open to navigation.'' The center drawspan navigation lights 
change from red to green when the drawspan is fully open to navigation.

Sec. 117.484  Pass Manchac.

    The draw of the Canadian National/Illinois Central Railroad 
automated bridge, mile 6.7, at Manchac, operates as follows:
    (a) The draw is not constantly manned and the bridge will normally 
be maintained in the open position, providing 56 feet vertical clearance 
above mean high tide to the raised tip of the bascule span for one-half 
the channel, and unlimited vertical clearance for the other half.
    (b) Railroad track circuits will detect an approaching train and 
initiate bridge closing warning broadcasts over marine radio and over 
the Public Address (PA) system six (6) minutes in advance of the train's 
arrival. Navigation channel warning lights will be lit, and 
photoelectric (infrared) boat detectors will monitor the waterway 
beneath the bridge for the presence of vessels. The waterway approaches 
to the bridge will be monitored by closed circuit TV (CCTV) cameras.
    (c) Activation of the warning broadcasts also activates a marine 
radio monitor in the Mays Yard (New Orleans switch yard). The yardmaster 
will continuously monitor marine radio

[[Page 486]]

broadcasts on the normal and emergency marine radio channels throughout 
the warning period and at all times the bridge is closed. The yardmaster 
will communicate with waterway users via the marine radio, if necessary.
    (d) At the end of warning period, if no vessels have been detected 
by the boat detectors, and no interruptions have been performed by the 
yardmaster based on his monitoring of the marine radio and the CCTV, the 
bridge lowering sequence will automatically proceed.
    (e) Upon passage of the train, the bridge will automatically open. 
Railroad track circuits will initiate the automatic bridge opening and 
closing sequences. (Estimated duration that the bridge will remain 
closed for passage of rail traffic is 10 to 12 minutes.) The bridge will 
also be manually operable from two locked trackside control locations 
(key releases) on the approach spans, one on each side of the movable 
span.
    (f) The yardmaster will be provided with a remote EMERGENCY STOP 
button which, if pressed, will stop the bridge operation, interrupt the 
lowering sequence, and immediately return the bridge to the open 
position. The yardmaster will utilize this control feature in the event 
a vessel operator issues an urgent radio call to keep the waterway open 
for immediate passage of the vessel.

Yard office.
    (3) The controller will monitor waterway traffic in the area of the 
bridge and directly beneath the bridge with closed circuit cameras 
mounted on top of the bridge and with surface navigational radar.
    (4) When the bridge closes for any reason, the controller will

    (6) While the Belt Line Bridge is moving from the full open position 
to the full closed position, the bridge/train controller will maintain 
constant surveillance of the navigational channel to ensure no conflict 
with maritime traffic exists. In the event of failure of a camera or the 
radar system, or loss of marine-radio communications, the bridge shall 
not be operated by the off-site bridge/train controller from the remote 
location.

will sound until the bridge is seated and locked down or in the full 
open position.
    (11) When the bridge has returned to its full up position, the mid-
channel light will turn from red to green, and the controller will 
announce over marine radio channel 13, ``Security, security, security, 
the Belt Line bridge is open for river traffic.'' Operational 
information will be provided 24 hours a day on marine channel 13 and via 
telephone (757) 543-1996 or (757) 545-2941.

Sec. 117.1035  Columbia River.

    (a) The term drawtender, as used in this section means the operator 
of the drawspan, whether that person may be a train crew member, 
maintenance person, or an officially designated drawtender.
    (b) The draw of the semi-automated Union Pacific railroad bridge 
(Kalan Bridge), mile 323.4, near Kennewick, Washington, is normally 
maintained in the fully open position with no drawtender in attendance. 
A radar beacon (RACON) is located at the center of the drawspan. The 
RACON operates only when the drawspan is fully open, by responding with 
the Morse letter ``K'' to X-band radar signals. When necessary to close 
the drawspan for the passage of a train or for maintenance, a drawtender 
shall be dispatched to operate the draw from either of the remote 
control stations located at the ends of the bridge. Operation of the 
bridge shall be as follows:
    (1) The drawtender shall broadcast a radio message over Channel 16-
VHF to

[[Page 539]]

all vessels in the vicinity that the Kalan Bridge will be closing in two 
minutes. If after two minutes no response is received, the drawtender 
shall broadcast a message over Channel 13-VHF that the Kalan Bridge is 
closing. Both messages shall be broadcast twice.
    (2) Prior to activating the closing sequence the drawtender shall 
visually inspect the waterway for marine traffic approaching the bridge. 
The closing sequence shall not be activated until after marine traffic 
has cleared the bridge.
    (3) When the closing sequence is activated, the following functions 
occur automatically: The RACON is deactivated, red strobe lights on the 
lift towers and on the channel piers start flashing, a downward pointing 
arrow consisting of amber colored lights is displayed from the center of 
the drawspan and a recorded message is broadcast over Channel 13-VHF 
advising that the Kalan Bridge is closed to river traffic. The radio 
message is repeated every five minutes, the red lights continue to flash 
and the downward pointing arrow is displayed, until the lift span 
returns to the up and locked position. At the end of the ten minutes, a 
horn sounds for 30 seconds, the span begins closing and the centerspan 
navigation lights turn from green to red. The horn sounds for 30 seconds 
at 10 minute intervals, until the lift span returns to the up and locked 
position.
    (4) If for any reason during the closing sequence a danger is posed 
to marine traffic, the closing sequence shall be stopped and the bridge 
reopened until the threat of danger has passed.
    (5) If the bridge is to be temporarily closed for maintenance or for 
purposes other than the passage of a train, the drawtender shall 
continually monitor Channels 13 and 16 for calls from approaching 
vessels, and respond to inquiries from vessels about the closure.
    (6) After a train has cleared the bridge, the following functions 
occur automatically: The drawspan returns to the fully open and locked 
position, the RACON is reactivated, the arrow display and the red strobe 
lights are extinguished, the red centerspan navigation lights return to 
green and a recorded message is broadcast over Channel 13-VHF that the 
Kalan Bridge is open for marine traffic.
    (7) Bridge status information may be obtained by calling the 
commercial telephone number posted at the drawspan of the bridge.
    (c) The draw of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad bridge at 
mile 328.0, between Pasco and Kennewick, shall open on signal from 8 
a.m. to 4 p.m. At all other times the draw shall open on signal if at 
least 2 hour's notice is given through the General Yardmaster, Pasco, 
Washington.

Department of Emergency Services, the bridge shall be capable of opening 
upon two hours notice. Notification of emergencies and requests for 
openings during emergencies are initiated through the Cowlitz County 
Department of Emergency Services.
    (3) The operating machinery of the draw shall be maintained in a 
serviceable condition and the draw shall be opened and closed at 
intervals frequent enough to make certain that the machinery is in 
proper order for satisfactory operation.
    (4) During periods of fog or similar periods of reduced visibility, 
the drawtender, after acknowledging the signal to open, shall toll a 
bell continuously during the approach and passage of the vessel.
    (b) The draw of the Allen Street Bridge, mile 5.5, need not open for

Sec. 118.65  Lights on fixed bridges.

    (a) Each fixed bridge span over a navigable channel shall be lighted 
so that the center of the navigable channel under each span will be 
marked by a range of two green lights, and each margin of each navigable 
channel will be marked by a red light: Provided, That when a margin of a 
channel is limited by a pier, only those lights prescribed in paragraph 
(b) of this section shall be required to mark such channel margin. The 
green lights shall each show through a horizontal arc of 360 deg.; they 
shall be securely mounted just below the outermost edge of the bridge 
span structure so as to be visible from an approaching vessel. Each red 
light shall show through a horizontal arc of 180 deg., and shall be 
securely mounted just below the outermost edge of the bridge span 
structure to show 90 deg. on either side of a line parallel to the axis 
of the channel so as to be visible from an approaching vessel.
    Note: Until such time that major repairs to or replacements of 
existing fixed span navigation lights colored green are made, it is 
permitted that only one of these lights marking the centerline of the 
same channel under a span shall be visible to an approaching vessel. 
When major repairs to or replacement of such existing green lights are 
made they shall conform with this paragraph.
    (b) Pier lights. When the navigable channel extends from pier to 
pier or when piers are located within the navigable channel, each end of 
such piers shall be lighted with a red light. Each such light shall show 
through a horizontal arc of 180 deg., and shall be securely fastened at 
the end of the pier as low as practicable but not lower than 2 feet 
above navigable high water to show 90 deg. on either side of a line

an arc of 180 deg., and shall be securely mounted on the pier, abutment 
or fixed portion of the bridge as low as practicable to show 90 deg. on 
either side of a line parallel to the axis of the channel so as to be 
visible from an approaching vessel.


<R05>
Sec. 118.80  Lights on bascule bridges.

    (a) Lift span lights. Each lift span of every bascule bridge shall 
be lighted so that the free end of the span will be marked on each side 
by a green light which shows only when the span is fully open for the 
passage of a vessel and by a red light which shows for all other 
positions of the lift span. Each red and each green light shall show 
through a horizontal arc of 180 deg.. The lighting apparatus shall be 
securely mounted to the side of the span so that the light will show 
equally on either side of a line parallel to the axis of the channels, 
so that they will be visible from an approaching vessel.
    Note: Until such time that major repairs to or replacement of lift 
span navigation lights are made, existing lights may show through a 
horizontal arc of less than 180 deg.. When major repairs to or 
replacement of existing lights are made they shall conform with this 
paragraph.

[[Page 558]]

    (b) Multiple parallel lift span lights. The outermost side of each 
outer span of every bascule bridge with parallel multiple lifts shall be 
lighted as prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section; the lights shall 
be controlled so that the green lights will be displayed only when all 
spans are open for navigation. The inner sides of each outer lift span 
and both sides of each inner lift span of such bascule bridge shall be 
lighted by red lights for all positions of the lift span. These lights 
shall have the same arcs of illumination and shall be mounted as 
described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Pier lights. Every bascule bridge shall be lighted so that each 
end of every pier, or protection pier where provided, in or adjacent to 
the navigable channels under the lift span or spans will be marked by a 
red light. Each such red light shall show through a horizontal arc of 
180 deg., and shall be securely mounted as low as practicable on the end 
of the pier, or protection pier, to show 90 deg. either side of a line 
parallel to the axis of the navigable channel so as to be visible from

Sec. 118.150  Traveller platforms.

    The District Commander may require under deck traveller platforms 
which may significantly reduce the vertical clearance when operated over 
navigation channels at night to be lighted with quick flashing red 
lights on each of the four lower corners.

[CGD 84-022, 51 FR 16314, May 2, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 118.160  Vertical clearance gauges.

    (a) When necessary for reasons of safety of navigation, the District 
Commander may require or authorize the installation of clearance gauges. 
Except as specified in Sec. 117.47(b) of this chapter for certain 
drawbridges, clearance gauges must meet the requirements of this 
section.
    (b) Clearance gauges must indicate the vertical distance between 
``low steel'' of the bridge channel span and the level of the water, 
measured to the bottom of the foot marks, read from top to bottom. Each 
gauge must be installed on the end of the right channel pier or pier 
protection structure facing approaching vessels and extend to a 
reasonable height above high water so as to be meaningful to the viewer. 
Other or additional locations may be prescribed by the District 
Commander if particular conditions or circumstances warrant.
    (c) Construction. Each gauge must be premanently fixed to the bridge 
pier or pier protection structure and made of a durable material of 
sufficient strength to provide resistence to weather, tide, and current. 
Gauges may be painted directly on the bridge channel pier or pier 
protection structure if the surface is suitable and has sufficient width 
to accommodate the foot marks (graduations) and numerals.
    (d) Numerals. (1) Each gauge must be marked by black numerals and 
foot marks on a white background. Paint, if used, must be of good 
exterior quality, resistant to excessive chalking or bleeding. 
Manufactured numerals and background material may be used.
    (2) The size, type, and spacing of numerals must conform to the 
Standard Alphabets for Highway Signs and the following table. The 
nominal day visibility distance is the distance at which the clearance 
information needs to be ascertained by approaching vessel operators. The 
District Commander determines this distance for each bridge.

More than 2,000.................          36  Series E......          10
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) The length of the foot marks must be no less than the width of a 
single numeral used (except numerals 1 and 4), be the same thickness as 
the width of stroke of the numeral, and extend to the nearest margin of 
the white background. Foot marks must be spaced every foot for nominal 
day visibility of less than 500 feet, every two feet for a nominal day 
visibility of more than 500 feet but less than 1,000 feet, and every 
five feet for nominal day visibility of more than 1,000 feet.
    (4) Intermediate foot marks may be used when more precise 
determination of actual clearance is necessary. Such intermediate foot 
marks must have a width of stroke one-half the width of the stroke 
required for the numeral and shall be three-quarters as long as the 
primary foot marks.
    (5) The horizontal distance between the numeral and nearest edge of 
the white background shall be no less than one-half the width of a 
single numeral (excepting numerals 1 and 4).
    (6) The minimum width of the white background shall be no less than 
three times the width of a single numeral (excepting numerals 1 and 4) 
plus the widths of each additional numeral (when multiple numerals are 
used plus numeral spacing).
    (e) Maintenance. The owner or operator of the bridge shall maintain 
each gauge in good repair and legible condition. The bridge owner or 
operator is

[[Page 561]]

responsible for the accuracy of the gauge and shall remeasure the 
vertical distance of the numerals and foot marks below ``low steel'' of 
the bridge whenever the gauge is repainted or the structure is repaired.

<R05>
Sec. 120.200  What must my Vessel Security Program cover?

    (a) If this part applies to your passenger vessel, you must 
implement a program for that vessel that--
    (1) Provides for the safety and security of persons and property 
traveling aboard the vessel, against unlawful acts;
    (2) Prevents or deters the carriage aboard the vessel of any

prohibited weapon, incendiary, or explosive, in stowed baggage, cargo, 
or stores;
    (3) Prevents or deters unauthorized access to the vessel and to 
restricted areas aboard the vessel;
    (4) Provides appropriate security measures for Security Levels I, 
II, and III that allow for increases in security when the Commandant or

disembarks passengers, to provide security for the passengers and the 
vessel. You need not duplicate any provisions fulfilled by the terminal 
unless directed to by the Commandant. When a provision is fulfilled by 
the terminal, the applicable section of the Vessel Security Plan 
required by Sec. 120.300 must refer to that fact.
