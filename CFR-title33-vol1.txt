                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2003), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

Sec. 1.05-5  Marine Safety and Security Council.

    The Marine Safety and Security Council, composed of senior Coast 
Guard officials, acts as policy advisor to the Commandant and is the 
focal point of the Coast Guard regulatory system. The Marine Safety and 
Security Council provides oversight, review, and guidance for all Coast 
Guard regulatory activity.

<R05>
Sec. 1.05-10  Regulatory process overview.

    (a) Most rules of local applicability are issued by District 
Commanders and Captains of the Port, while rules of wider applicability 
are issued by senior Coast Guard officials at Coast Guard Headquarters, 
For both significant rulemaking (defined by Executive Order 12866, 
Regulatory Planning and Review) and non-significant rulemaking, other 
than those areas delegated to District Commanders and Captains of the 
Port, the regulatory process begins when an office chief with program 
responsibilities identifies a possible need for a new regulation or for 
changes to an existing regulation. The need may arise due to statutory 
changes, or be based on internal review or public input. Early public 
involvement is strongly encouraged.
    (b) After a tentative significant regulatory approach is developed, 
a significant regulatory project proposal is submitted to the Marine 
Safety and Security Council for approval. The proposal describes the 
scope of the proposed regulation, alternatives considered, and potential 
cost and benefits, including possible environmental impacts. All 
significant regulatory projects require Marine Safety and Security 
Council approval.
    (c) Significant rulemaking projects must also be approved by the 
Commandant of the Coast Guard.
    (d) If the project is approved, the necessary documents are drafted, 
including documents to be published in the Federal Register. These may 
include regulatory evaluations, environmental analyses, requests for 
comments, announcements of public meetings, notices of proposed 
rulemakings, and final rules.

[CGD 95-057, 60 FR 34148, June 30, 1995, as amended by USCG-2003-14505, 
68 FR 9534, Feb. 28, 2003; USCG-2003-15404, 68 FR 37740, June 25, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 1.05-15  Public participation.

    The Coast Guard considers public participation essential to 
effective rulemaking, and encourages the public to participate in its 
rulemaking process. Coast Guard policy is to provide opportunities for 
public participation early in potential rulemaking projects. Generally, 
the Coast Guard will solicit public input by publishing a notice of 
public meeting or request for comments in the Federal Register. Advance 
Notices of Proposed Rulemaking, Notices of Proposed Rulemaking, 
Supplemental Notices of Proposed Rulemaking, and Interim Rules will 
usually provide 90 days, or more if possible, after publication for 
submission of comments. This time period is intended to allow interested 
persons the opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process through 
the submission of written data and views. However, certain cases and 
circumstances may make it necessary to provide a shorter comment period. 
Public meetings may also be held to provide an opportunity for oral 
presentations. The Coast Guard will consider the comments received and, 
in subsequent rulemaking documents, will incorporate a concise general 
statement of the comments received and identify changes from a proposed 
rule based on the comments.


<R05>
Sec. 1.05-20  Petitions for rulemaking.

    (a) Any member of the public may petition the Coast Guard to 
undertake a rulemaking action. There is no prescribed form for a 
petition for rulemaking, but the document should provide some supporting 
information as to why the petitioner believes the proposed rulemaking is 
necessary and the document should clearly indicate that it is a petition 
for rulemaking. Petitions should be addressed to the Executive 
Secretary, Marine Safety and Security Council (G-LRA), United States 
Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593-
0001.
    (b) The petitioner will be notified of the Coast Guard's decision 
whether to initiate a rulemaking or not. If the Coast Guard decides not 
to pursue a rulemaking, the petitioner will be notified of the reasons 
why. If the Coast Guard decides to initiate rulemaking, it will follow 
the procedure outlined in this subpart. The Coast Guard may publish a 
notice acknowledging receipt of a petition for rulemaking in the Federal 
Register.

[[Page 14]]

    (c) Any petition for rulemaking and any reply to the petition will 
be kept in a public file open for inspection.

[CGD 95-057, 60 FR 34148, June 30, 1995, as amended by USCG-2003-15404, 
68 FR 37740, June 25, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 1.05-25  Public docket.

    (a) A public file is maintained for each petition for rulemaking and 
each Coast Guard regulation and notice published in the Federal 
Register. Each file contains copies of every rulemaking document 
published for the project, public comments received, summaries of public 
meetings or hearings, regulatory assessments, and other publicly-
available information. Members of the public may inspect the public 
docket and copy any documents in the file. Each rulemaking document will 
identify where the public file for that rulemaking is maintained. Public 
dockets for rulemakings originating at Coast Guard Headquarters are kept 
at a Docket Management Facility (DMS) maintained by the Department of 
Transportation, at the Nassif Building, room PL-401, 400 Seventh Street 
SW., Washington, DC 20590-0001. These dockets are available 
electronically through the DMS Web site at http://dms.dot.gov.
    (b) The public dockets for Coast Guard rulemaking activity initiated 
by Coast Guard District Commanders are available for public inspection 
at the appropriate Coast Guard District office.
    (c) The public dockets for Coast Guard rulemaking activity initiated 
by Captains of the Port are available for inspection at the appropriate 
Captain of the Port office.

<R05>
Sec. 1.05-30  Advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM).

    An advance notice of proposed rulemaking may be used to alert the 
affected public about a new regulatory project, or when the Coast Guard 
needs more information about what form proposed regulations should take, 
the actual need for a regulation, the cost of a proposal, or any other 
information. The ANPRM may solicit general information or ask the public 
to respond to specific questions.


<R05>
Sec. 1.05-35  Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).

    Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 553, an NPRM 
is generally published in the Federal Register for Coast Guard 
rulemakings. The NPRM normally contains a preamble statement in 
sufficient detail to explain the proposal, its background, basis, and 
purpose, and the various issues involved. It also contains a discussion 
of any comments received in response to prior notices, a citation of 
legal authority for the rule, and the text of the proposed rule.


<R05>
Sec. 1.05-40  Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM).

    An SNPRM may be issued if a proposed rule has been substantially 
changed from the original notice of proposed rulemaking. The 
supplemental notice advises the public of the revised proposal and 
provides an opportunity for additional comment. To give the public a 
reasonable opportunity to become reacquainted with a rulemaking, a 
supplemental notice may also be issued if considerable time has elapsed 
since publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking. An SNPRM contains 
the same type of information generally included in an NPRM.


<R05>
Sec. 1.05-45  Interim rule.

    (a) An interim rule may be issued when it is in the public interest 
to promulgate an effective rule while keeping the rulemaking open for 
further refinement. For example, an interim rule may be issued in 
instances when normal procedures for notice and comment prior to issuing 
an effective rule are not required, minor changes to the final rule may 
be necessary after the interim rule has been in place for some time, or 
the interim rule only implements portions of a proposed rule, while 
other portions of the proposed rule are still under development.
    (b) An interim rule will be published in the Federal Register with 
an effective date that will generally be at least 30 days after the date 
of publication. After the effective date, an interim rule is enforceable 
and is codified in

[[Page 15]]

the next annual revision of the appropriate title of the Code of Federal 
Regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 1.05-50  Final rule.

    In some instances, a final rule may be issued without prior notice 
and comment. When notice and comment procedures have been used, and 
after all comments received have been considered, a final rule is 
issued. A final rule document contains a preamble that discusses 
comments received, responses to comments and changes made from the 
proposed or interim rule, a citation of legal authority, and the text of 
the rule.


<R05>
Sec. 1.05-55  Direct final rule.

    (a) A direct final rule may be issued to allow noncontroversial 
rules that are unlikely to result in adverse public comment to become 
effective more quickly.
    (b) A direct final rule will be published in the Federal Register 
with an effective date that is generally at least 90 days after the date 
of publication.
    (c) The public will usually be given at least 60 days from the date 
of publication in which to submit comments or notice of intent to submit 
comments.
    (d) If no adverse comment or notice of intent to submit an adverse 
comment is received within the specified period, the Coast Guard will 
publish a notice in the Federal Register to confirm that the rule will 
go into effect as scheduled.
    (e) If the Coast Guard receives a written adverse comment or a 
written notice of intent to submit an adverse comment, the Coast Guard 
will publish a notice in the final rule section of the Federal Register 
to announce withdrawal of the direct final rule. If an adverse comment 
clearly applies to only part of a rule, and it is possible to remove 
that part without affecting the remaining portions, the Coast Guard may 
adopt as final those parts of the rule on which no adverse comment was 
received. Any part of a rule that is the subject of an adverse comment 
will be withdrawn. If the Coast Guard decides to proceed with a 
rulemaking following receipt of an adverse comment, a separate Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) will be published unless an exception to the 
Administrative Procedure Act requirements for notice and comment 
applies.
    (f) A comment is considered adverse if the comment explains why the 
rule would be inappropriate, including a challenge to the rule's 
underlying premise or approach, or would be ineffective or unacceptable 
without a change.

<R05>
Sec. 1.05-60  Negotiated rulemaking.

    (a) The Coast Guard may establish a negotiated rulemaking committee 
under the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990 and the Federal Advisory 
Committee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. App. 2) when it is in the public 
interest.
    (b) Generally, the Coast Guard will consider negotiated rulemaking 
when:
    (1) There is a need for a rule;
    (2) There are a limited number of representatives for identifiable 
parties affected by the rule;
    (3) There is a reasonable chance that balanced representation can be 
reached in the negotiated rulemaking committee and that the committee 
members will negotiate in good faith;
    (4) There is a likelihood of a committee consensus in a fixed time 
period;
    (5) The negotiated rulemaking process will not unreasonably delay 
the rule;
    (6) The Coast Guard has resources to do negotiated rulemaking; and
    (7) The Coast Guard can use the consensus of the committee in 
formulating the NPRM and final rule.

command, delegated to carry out the provisions of Sec. 1.07-10(b).
    (b) The term Hearing Officer means a Coast Guard officer or employee 
who has been delegated the authority to assess civil penalties.
    (c) The term issuing officer means any qualified Coast Guard 
commissioned, warrant, or petty officer.
    (d) The term Notice of Violation means a notification of violation 
and preliminary assessment of penalty, given to a party, in accordance 
with Sec. 1.07-11.
    (e) The term party means the person alleged to have violated a

<R05>
Sec. 1.07-10  Reporting and investigation.

    (a) Any person may report an apparent violation of any law, 
regulation, or order that is enforced by the Coast Guard to any Coast 
Guard facility. When a report of an apparent violation has been 
received, or when an apparent violation has been detected by any Coast 
Guard personnel, the matter is investigated or evaluated by Coast Guard 
personnel. Once an apparent violation has been investigated or 
evaluated, a report of the investigation may be sent to the District 
Commander or other designated official in accordance with paragraph (b) 
of this section or a Notice of Violation under Sec. 1.07-11 may be given 
to the party by an issuing officer.
    (b) Reports of any investigation conducted by the Coast Guard or 
received from any other agency which indicate that a violation may have 
occurred may be forwarded to a District Commander or other designated 
official for further action. This is normally the District Commander of 
the District in which the violation is believed to have occurred, or the 
District in which the reporting unit or agency is found. The report is 
reviewed to determine if there is sufficient evidence to establish a 
prima facie case. If there is insufficient evidence, the case is either 
returned for further investigation or closed if further action is 
unwarranted. The case is closed in situations in which the investigation 
has established that a violation did not occur, the violator is unknown, 
or there is little likelihood of discovering additional relevant facts. 
If it is determined that a prima facie case does exist, a case file is 
prepared and forwarded to the Hearing Officer, with a recommended 
action. A record of any prior violations by the same person or entity, 
is forwarded with the case file.

<R05>
Sec. 1.07-11  Notice of violation.

    (a) After investigation and evaluation of an alleged violation has 
been completed, an issuing officer may issue a Notice of Violation to 
the party.
    (b) The Notice of Violation will contain the following information:
    (1) The alleged violation and the applicable law or regulations 
violated;
    (2) The amount of the maximum penalty that may be assessed for each 
violation;
    (3) The amount of proposed penalty that appears to be appropriate;
    (4) A statement that payment of the proposed penalty within 45 days 
will settle the case;
    (5) The place to which, and the manner in which, payment is to be 
made;
    (6) A statement that the party may decline the Notice of Violation 
and that if the Notice of Violation is declined, the party has the right 
to a hearing prior to a final assessment of a penalty by a Hearing 
Officer.
    (7) A statement that failure to either pay the proposed penalty on 
the Notice of Violation or decline the Notice of Violation and request a 
hearing within 45 days will result in a finding of default and the Coast 
Guard will proceed with the civil penalty in the amount recommended on 
the Notice of Violation without processing the violation under the 
procedures described in 33 CFR 1.07-10(b).

[[Page 17]]

    (c) The Notice of Violation may be hand delivered to the party or an 
employee of the party, or may be mailed to the business address of the 
party.
    (d) If a party declines the Notice of Violation within 45 days, the 
case file will be sent to the District Commander for processing under 
the procedures described in 33 CFR 1.07-10(b).
    (e) If a party pays the proposed penalty on the Notice of Violation 
within 45 days, a finding of proved will be entered into the case file.
    (f) If within 45 days of receipt a party--
    (1) Fails to pay the proposed penalty on the Notice of Violation; 
and
    (2) Fails to decline the Notice of Violation--the Coast Guard will 
enter a finding of default in the case file and proceed with the civil 
penalty in the amount recommended on the Notice of Violation without 
processing the violation under the procedures described in 33 CFR 1.07-
10(b).

<R05>
Sec. 1.07-15  Hearing Officer.

    (a) The Hearing Officer has no other responsibility, direct or 
supervisory, for the investigation of cases referred for the assessment 
of civil penalties. The hearing officer may take action on a case 
referred by any District Commander.
    (b) The Hearing Officer decides each case on the basis of the 
evidence before him, and must have no prior connection with the case. 
The Hearing Officer is solely responsible for the decision in each case 
referred to him.
    (c) The Hearing Officer is authorized to administer oaths and issue 
subpoenas necessary to the conduct of a hearing, to the extent provided 
by law.

<R05>
Sec. 1.07-20  Initiation of action.

    (a) When a case is received for action, the Hearing Officer makes a 
preliminary examination of the material submitted. If, on the basis of 
the preliminary examination, the Hearing Officer determines that there 
is insufficient evidence to proceed, or that there is any other reason 
which would make penalty action inappropriate, the Hearing Officer 
returns the case to the District Commander with a written statement of 
the reason. The District Commander may close the case or cause a further 
investigation of the alleged violation to be made with a view toward 
resubmittal of the case to the Hearing Officer.
    (b) If on the basis of the preliminary examination of the case file, 
the Hearing Officer determines that a violation appears to have been 
committed, the Hearing Officer notifies the party in writing of:
    (1) The alleged violation and the applicable law or regulations;
    (2) The amount of the maximum penalty that may be assessed for each 
violation;
    (3) The general nature of the procedure for assessing and collecting 
the penalty;
    (4) The amount of penalty that appears to be appropriate, based on 
the material then available to the Hearing Officer;
    (5) The right to examine all materials in the case file and have a 
copy of all written documents provided upon request; and,
    (6) The fact that the party may demand a hearing prior to any actual 
assessment of a penalty.
    (c) If at any time it appears that the addition of another party to 
the proceedings is necessary or desirable, the Hearing Officer provides 
the additional party with notice as described above.


<R05>
Sec. 1.07-25  Preliminary matters.

    (a) Within 30 days after receipt of notice of the initiation of the 
action, as described above, the party, or counsel for the party, may 
request a hearing, provide any written evidence and arguments in lieu of 
a hearing, or pay the amount specified in the notice as being 
appropriate. A hearing must be requested in writing; the request must 
specify the issues which are in dispute. Failure to specify a 
nonjurisdictional issue will preclude its consideration.
    (b) The right to a hearing is waived if the party does not submit 
the request to the Hearing Officer within 30 days after receiving notice 
of the alleged

[[Page 18]]

violation. At the discretion of the Hearing Officer, a hearing may be 
granted if the party submits a late request.
    (c) The Hearing Officer must promptly schedule all hearings which 
are requested. The Hearing Officer shall grant any delays or 
continuances which may be necessary or desirable in the interest of 
fairly resolving the case.
    (d) A party who has requested a hearing may amend the specification 
of the issues in dispute at any time up to 10 days before the scheduled 
date of the hearing. Issues raised later than 10 days before the 
scheduled hearing may be presented only at the discretion of the Hearing 
Officer.

<R05>
Sec. 1.07-30  Disclosure of evidence.

    The alleged violator may, upon request, receive a free copy of all 
the written evidence in the case file, except material that would 
disclose or lead to the disclosure of the identity of a confidential 
informant. Other evidence or material, such as blueprints, sound or 
video tapes, oil samples, and photographs may be examined in the Hearing 
Officer's offices. The Hearing Officer may provide for examination or 
testing of evidence at other locations if there are adequate safeguards 
to prevent loss or tampering.


<R05>
Sec. 1.07-35  Request for confidential treatment.

    (a) In addition to information treated as confidential under 
Sec. 1.07-30, a request for confidential treatment of a document or 
portion thereof may be made by the person supplying the information on 
the basis that the information is:
    (1) Confidential financial information, trade secrets, or other 
material exempt from disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act (5 
U.S.C. 552);
    (2) Required to be held in confidence by 18 U.S.C. 1905; or
    (3) Otherwise exempt by law from disclosure.
    (b) The person desiring confidential treatment must submit the 
request to the Hearing Officer in writing and state the reasons 
justifying nondisclosure. Failure to make a timely request may result in 
a document being considered as nonconfidential and subject to release.
    (c) Confidential material is not considered by the Hearing Officer 
in reaching a decision unless:
    (1) It has been furnished by a party, or
    (2) It has been furnished pursuant to a subpoena.

<R05>
Sec. 1.07-40  Counsel.

    A party has the right to be represented at all stages of the 
proceeding by counsel. After receiving notification that a party is 
represented by counsel, the Hearing Officer directs all further 
communications to that counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 1.07-45  Location of hearings and change of venue.

    (a) The hearing is normally held at the office of the Hearing 
Officer.
    (b) The Hearing Officer may transfer a case to another Hearing 
Officer on request or on the Hearing Officer's own motion.
    (c) A request for change of location of a hearing or transfer to 
another Hearing Officer must be in writing and state the reasons why the 
requested action is necessary or desirable. Action on the request is at 
the discretion of the Hearing Officer.

<R05>
Sec. 1.07-50  Witnesses.

    A party may present the testimony of any witness either through a 
personal appearance or through a written statement. The party may 
request the assistance of the Hearing Officer in obtaining the personal 
appearance of a witness. The request must be in writing and state the 
reasons why a written statement would be inadequate, the issue or issues 
to which the testimony would be relevant, and the substance of the 
expected testimony. If the Hearing Officer determines that the personal 
appearance of the witness may materially aid in the decision on the 
case, the

[[Page 19]]

Hearing Officer seeks to obtain the witness' appearance. Because many 
statutes prescribing civil penalties do not provide subpoena power, 
there may be cases where a witness cannot be required to attend. In such 
a case, the Hearing Officer may move the hearing to the witness' 
location, accept a written statement, or accept a stipulation in lieu of 
testimony. If none of these procedures is practical, the Hearing Officer 
shall proceed on the basis of the evidence before him.

[CGD 78-82, 43 FR 54186, Nov. 20, 1978, as amended by USCG-2002-12471,

<R05>
Sec. 1.07-55  Hearing procedures.

    (a) The Hearing Officer must conduct a fair and impartial proceeding 
in which the party is given a full opportunity to be heard. At the 
outset of the hearing, the Hearing Officer insures that the party is 
aware of the nature of the proceeding and of the alleged violation, and 
of the provisions of the law or regulation allegedly violated.
    (b) The material in the case file pertinent to the issues to be 
determined by the Hearing Officer is presented. The party has the right 
to examine, and to respond to or rebut, this material. The party may 
offer any facts, statements, explanations, documents, sworn or unsworn 
testimony, or other exculpatory items which bear on appropriate issues, 
or which may be relevant to the size of an appropriate penalty. The 
Hearing Officer may require the authentication of any written exhibit or 
statement.
    (c) At the close of the party's presentation of evidence, the 
Hearing Officer may allow the introduction of rebuttal evidence. The 
Hearing Officer may allow the party to respond to any such evidence 
submitted.
    (d) In receiving evidence, the Hearing Officer is not bound by 
strict rules of evidence. In evaluating the evidence presented, the 
Hearing Officer must give due consideration to the reliability and 
relevance of each item of evidence.
    (e) The Hearing Officer may take notice of matters which are subject 
to a high degree of indisputability and are commonly known in the 
community or are ascertainable from readily available sources of known 
accuracy. Prior to taking notice of a matter, the Hearing Officer gives 
the party an opportunity to show why notice should not be taken. In any 
case in which notice is taken, the Hearing Officer places a written 
statement of the matters as to which notice was taken in the record, 
with the basis for such notice, including a statement that the party 
consented to notice being taken or a summary of the party's objections.
    (f) After the evidence in the case has been presented, the party may 
present argument on the issues in the case. The party may also request 
an opportunity to submit a written statement for consideration by the

a reasonable time for submission of the statement and shall specify the

Sec. 1.07-60  Records.

    (a) A verbatim transcript will not normally be prepared. The Hearing 
Officer prepares notes on the material and points raised by the party, 
in sufficient detail to permit a full and fair review and resolution of 
the case, should it be appealed.
    (b) A party may, at its own expense, cause a verbatim transcript to 
be made. If a verbatim transcript is made, the party shall submit two 
copies to the Hearing Officer not later than the time of filing an 
administrative appeal. The Hearing Officer includes them in the record.

Sec. 1.07-65  Hearing Officer's decisions.

    (a) The Hearing Officer issues a written decision. Any decision to 
assess a penalty is based upon substantial evidence in the record. If 
the Hearing Officer finds that there is not substantial evidence in the 
record establishing the alleged violation or some other violation of 
which the party had full and fair notice, the Hearing Officer shall

[[Page 20]]

dismiss the case and remand it to the District Commander. A dismissal is 
without prejudice to the District Commander's right to refile the case 
and have it reheard if additional evidence is obtained. A dismissal 
following a rehearing is final and with prejudice.
    (b) If the Hearing Officer assesses a penalty, the Hearing Officer's 
decision contains a statement advising the party of the right to an 
administrative appeal. The party is advised that failure to submit an 
appeal within the prescribed time will bar its consideration and that 
failure to appeal on the basis of a particular issue will constitute a 
waiver of that issue in any subsequent proceeding.

Hearing Officer. The only issues which will be considered on appeal are 
those issues specified in the appeal which were properly raised before 
the Hearing Officer and jurisdictional questions.
    (b) The failure to file an appeal within the prescribed time limit 
results in the action of the Hearing Officer becoming the final agency 
action in the case.


<R05>
Sec. 1.07-75  Action on appeals.

    (a) Upon receipt, the Hearing Officer provides a copy of the appeal 
and any supporting brief to the District Commander who referred the 
case. Any comments which the District Commander desires to submit must 
be received by the Hearing Officer within 30 days. The Hearing Officer 
includes the District Commander's comments, or not later than 30 days 
after receipt of the appeal if no comments are submitted by the District 
Commander, the Hearing Officer forwards all materials in the case to the 
Commandant.
    (b) The Commandant issues a written decision in each case and 
furnishes copies to the party, the District Commander, and the Hearing 
Officer, The Commandant may affirm, reverse, or modify the decision, or 
remand the case for new or additional proceedings. In the absence of a 
remand, the decision of the Commandant on appeal shall be final. In 
addition to the actions which may be taken by the Commandant on appeal, 
the Commandant may also remit, mitigate or suspend the assessment in 
whole or in part. Upon the taking of remission, mitigation, or 
suspension action, the Commandant will inform the party of the action 
and any conditions placed on the action.

case, a party may petition to reopen the hearing on the basis of newly 
discovered evidence.
    (b) Petitions to reopen must be in writing describing the newly 
found evidence and must state why the evidence would probably produce a 
different result favorable to the petitioner, whether the evidence was 
known to the petitioner at the time of the hearing and, if not, why the 
newly found evidence could not have been discovered in the exercise of 
due diligence. The party must submit the petition to the Hearing 
Officer.
    (c) The District Commander may file comments in opposition to the 
petition. If comments are filed, a copy is provided the party.
    (d) A petition to reopen is considered by the Hearing Officer unless 
an appeal has been filed, in which case the petition is considered by 
the Commandant.
    (e) The decision on the petition is decided on the basis of the 
record, the petition, and the comments in opposition, if any. The 
petition is granted only when newly found evidence is described which 
has a direct and material bearing on the issues and when a valid 
explanation is provided as to why the evidence was not and could not 
have been, in the exercise of due diligence, produced at the hearing. 
The decision is rendered in writing.
    (f) Following a denial of a petition to reopen, the party is given 
30 days to file an appeal if one has not already

appeal, or the Hearing Officer's decision in a case in which no appeal 
has been filed, the party must submit payment of any assessed penalty to 
the office specified in the assessment notice. Failure to make timely 
payment will result in the insititution of appropriate action under the 
Federal Claims Collection Act and the regulations issued thereunder.
    (c) When a penalty of not more than $200 has been assessed under 
Chapter 43 or 123 of Title 46 U.S.C., the matter may be referred for 
collection of the penalty directly to the Federal Magistrate of the 
jurisdiction wherein the person liable may be found, for the institution 
of collection procedures under supervision of the district court, if the 
court has issued an order delegating such authority under section 636(b)

equipment, apparatus, temporary shelter, and services under certain 
specified conditions as authorized by law.
    (b) These sales are intended to permit repayment of costs involved 
in those instances which are ordinarily outside the scope of those 
distress services with which the Coast Guard is primarily concerned (14 
U.S.C. 88), or the equipment and apparatus are not readily procurable in 
the open market.

Sec. 1.26-5  Replacement of medals.

    (a) A medal, or a bar, emblem, or insignia in lieu thereof, that is 
lost, destroyed, or rendered unfit for use without fault or neglect on 
the part of the person to whom it was awarded by the Coast Guard is 
replaced without charge by the Coast Guard as authorized in 14 U.S.C. 
501.
    (b) A medal, a bar, emblem or insignia in lieu thereof, that is 
lost, destroyed, or rendered unfit for use due to the fault or neglect 
of the person to whom it was awarded, is replaced after the Coast Guard 
is reimbursed for its cost. Current prices may be obtained from 
Commandant (G-WPM-3), 2100 2nd St. SW. Washington, DC 20593.

Sec. 1.26-10  Sales to Coast Guard Auxiliary.

    (a) The provisions of Title 14, U.S. Code, section 891, authorizes 
the Coast Guard to furnish the Coast Guard Auxiliary such items as 
flags, pennants, uniforms, and insignia at actual cost.

[[Page 26]]

    (b) Sales of the following items (when available) are permitted to 
members of the Auxiliary:
    (1) Auxiliary flags and pennants.
    (2) Uniforms.
    (3) Auxiliary insignia.

(Sec. 891, 63 Stat. 557 (14 U.S.C. 891)).


<R05>
Sec. 1.26-15  Sales of nonexcess personal property and services.

    (a) Authority. The provisions of Title 14, U.S. Code, section 
641(b), authorizes the Coast Guard to sell apparatus or equipment 
manufactured by or in use in the Coast Guard, which is not readily 
procurable in the open market. The provisions of Title 14, U.S. Code, 
section 654 (Pub. L. 86-159 approved Aug. 14, 1959), authorize the Coast 
Guard to sell supplies and furnish services to public and commercial 
vessels, and other watercraft. 49 U.S.C. 44502(d) authorizes the Coast 
Guard to provide for assistance, the sale of fuel, oil, equipment, and 
supplies, to an aircraft when necessary to allow the aircraft to 
continue to the nearest private airport.
    (b) Charges established by District Commander. The charges for 
supplies and services which may be normally expected to be furnished to 
persons, corporations, companies, vessels, and other watercraft, and 
non-Federal aircraft will vary between various geographical regions 
depending on local circumstances. The District Commander is hereby 
delegated authority to prescribe and he shall establish, in advance 
wherever practicable, the charges to be imposed and collected in various 
areas under his jurisdiction, which will be in accordance with the 
applicable general minimum terms and conditions in the laws and this 
section. In those cases where the charges have not been established in 
advance, the matter shall be priced on an individual basis, taking into 
consideration the facts and circumstances regarding the situation. The 
list(s) of charges established by the District Commander shall be 
available for reading and copying at the office of the issuing District 
Commander, which list(s) will be up-dated and reissued when necessary.
    (c) Sales to vessels and other watercraft. (1) The charges imposed 
for services are intended to permit repayment of costs involved in those 
instances where supplies and services are furnished to meet the 
necessities of the circumstances, and such vessels or watercraft are not 
within the scope of those distress services performed by the Coast 
Guard.
    (2) Charges for sales of supplies and/or furnishing of services are 
considered appropriate when the furnishing of food, fuel, general 
stores, or repairs to the vessel or its equipage are primarily for the 
convenience of the owner, master, or crew, and furnished at his or their 
request. It is not intended and the Coast Guard does not procure and 
stock equipment and supplies except as provided for in current 
instructions issued by competent authority.
    (3) Supplies provided and services performed will be of a limited 
nature consistent with the situation and within the capabilities of the 
Coast Guard unit concerned; provided this will not be in competition 
with commercial enterprise when such facilities are available and deemed 
adequate. It is not intended to permit the operators of vessels or 
watercraft to take advantage of the Government by demanding free 
supplies or services. Determination as to whether charges will be made 
is dependent upon the circumstances involved in each instance. The 
responsibility to make this determination rests with the District 
Commander who may delegate it to his subordinates.
    (4) The minimum charge for any supplies or services furnished to a 
vessel or other watercraft shall be $10. The prices for fuels and 
materials which may be sold will be at Coast Guard cost plus 20 percent 
or, if readily determinable, at the commercial price in the immediate 
operating area, whichever is higher. The charges for services furnished 
a vessel or watercraft will be an average cost equal to the full price, 
plus taxes, that a boat owner would pay a local commercial concern for 
such services.
    (5) The sales of supplies and services will be documented and will 
set forth the name, type, and identifying number of the vessel or 
watercraft receiving supplies or services; name and address of vessel's 
owner; and conditions under which it was determined to make a sale to 
the vessel or watercraft. Wherever possible, payment shall be

[[Page 27]]

obtained at the time supplies and services are furnished.
    (d) Sales of equipment not readily procurable on the open market. 
Charges imposed for sales of apparatus and equipment manufactured by or 
in use in the Coast Guard which, in the opinion of the Commandant (FS), 
is not readily procurable in the open market, are subject to the 
following conditions:
    (1) The apparatus or equipment has not been reported as excess to 
the General Services Administration (if so reported, requests to 
purchase will be submitted by the Commandant (FS) to the General 
Services Administration); and,
    (2) The apparatus or equipment is not classified for security 
reasons or is not dangerous to the public health and safety; and,
    (3) The authorized buyers of this apparatus or equipment are 
foreign, State, or municipal governments or governmental units thereof; 
parties required to maintain private aids to navigation; contractors 
engaged on public works; and in other cases in which, in the judgment of 
the Commandant (FS), the public interest may be served; and,
    (4) The approved sales will be at prices determined by the 
Commandant (FS), which will include an overhead charge not to exceed 25 
percent of acquisition cost.
    (e) Sales to and storage of non-Federal aircraft. (1) Activities 
having the necessary supplies and facilities are authorized to furnish 
fuel, oil, equipment, supplies, mechanical services, temporary storage, 
or other assistance to any aircraft operated by State, municipal, or 
private enterprise in emergency cases. Complete engines, airplane wings, 
or other major items of equipment shall not be furnished without prior 
authority from the Commandant.
    (2) Aircraft damaged to the extent that major repairs are required 
may be given emergency storage at the request of the pilot, provided the 
necessary facilities are available. No such aircraft will be given a 
major or minor overhaul. Damaged aircraft may be stored in its original 
damaged condition. If aircraft requires extensive repairs, such as would 
include the replacing of major parts and such major parts cannot be made 
available or supplied within a reasonable length of time by the operator 
of such aircraft, then the aircraft must be removed from the Coast Guard 
reservation by the operator without delay.
    (3) The Government will not assume any responsibility for any loss 
or damage incurred by such aircraft while on a Coast Guard reservation 
and the owner shall be required to remove the aircraft from the 
reservation at the earliest practicable date.
    (4) Storage charges for such aircraft on a Coast Guard reservation 
shall be as follows:
    (i) For the first 6 working days, no charge;
    (ii) For each calendar day thereafter, $3 for a single motor plane 
and $5 for a dual or multiengine plane.
    (5) In the absence of any information to the contrary regarding a 
particular item or material, the price at which the item is carried in 
stock, or on the Plant Property Record (book price) will be regarded as 
the fair market value.
    (6) When materials or services or both materials and services are 
furnished an aircraft, a deposit equal to the estimated value of such 
services and materials as will be required shall be obtained in advance 
of the rendition of the services and issuance of the materials.
    (7) The charges for mechanical services rendered (other than in 
connection with the arrival, refueling, and departure of airplanes) 
shall be an hourly charge for labor, with a minimum of 1 hour, which 
shall be the equivalent to the schedule of wage rates for civilian 
personnel for the district (i.e., machinists, helpers, etc.), regardless 
of whether the services are performed by enlisted or civilian personnel.

    (b) Diplomatic transactions. Sales of Coast Guard material under 
reimbursable aid will be by direction of the Commandant (FS) and as 
approved by the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. Reimbursable 
aid transactions are diplomatic transactions and are negotiated 
primarily between the respective foreign military attache or other 
representatives of their embassy in Washington, DC, and the Office of 
the Chief of Naval Operations. Prices will be based on material cost 
only and estimates will not include packing, crating, and handling or 
transportation costs. Under reimbursable aid, transportation costs are

                          Subpart 2.01--Purpose


<R05>
Sec. 2.01-1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to inform the public of the definitions 
which the Coast Guard uses to examine waters to determine whether the 
Coast Guard has jurisdiction on those waters under particular U.S. laws.


<R04>
            Subpart 2.05--Definitions of Jurisdictional Terms


<R05>
Sec. 2.05-1  High seas.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, 
high seas means all waters which are neither territorial seas nor 
internal waters of the United States or of any foreign country. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\It should be noted that under 14 U.S.C. 89 the Coast Guard is 
authorized to enforce the laws of the United States upon the ``high 
seas'' and waters over which the United States has jurisdiction. Certain 
of the criminal laws of the United States are based on its special 
maritime and territorial jurisdiction, one of whose components is the 
``high seas'', as defined in paragraph (b). However, this definition of 
``high seas'' does not apply to the use of ``high seas'' found in 14 
U.S.C. 89, to which the definition in paragraph (a) applies. A clear 
distinction should be maintained between the Coast Guard's authority 
under 14 U.S.C. 89 and the jurisdictional base of the criminal laws 
which apply to the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction. For 
example, while assault (18 U.S.C. 113) committed seaward of the 
territorial sea could be committed on the ``high seas'' for both 
purposes, an assault committed within the territorial sea could be 
committed on the ``high seas'' to bring it within the special maritime 
and territorial jurisdiction and at the same time be committed on waters 
over which the United States has jurisdiction (not the ``high seas'') 
for purposes of the Coast Guard's authority to undertake enforcement 
action.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 29]]

    (b) High seas, as used in 18 U.S.C. 7(1), means the Great Lakes and 
waters seaward of the low water line along the coast, except waters 
within harbors or narrow coastal indentations enclosed by promontories. 
\1\
    (c) High seas, as used in section 2 of the Act of February 19, 1895, 
as amended, 33 U.S.C. 151, and all laws referring thereto, means the 
waters seaward of the lines described in 46 CFR 7.

<R05>
Sec. 2.05-5  Territorial seas.

    (a) With respect to the United States, territorial seas means the 
waters within the belt, 3 nautical miles wide, that is adjacent to its 
coast and seaward of the territorial sea baseline.
    (b) With respect to any foreign country, territorial seas means the 
waters within the belt that is adjacent to its coast and whose breadth 
and baseline are recognized by the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 2.05-10  Territorial sea baseline.

    Territorial Sea Baseline means the delimitation of the shoreward 
extent of the territorial seas of the United States drawn in accordance 
with principles, as recognized by the United States, of the Convention 
on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, 15 U.S.T. 1606. Charts 
depicting the territorial sea baseline are available for examination in 
accordance with Sec. 1.10-5(b) of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 2.05-15  Contiguous zone.

    Contiguous zone means the belt of high seas, 9 nautical miles wide, 
that is adjacent to and seaward of the territorial seas of the United 
States and that was declared to exist in Department of State Public 
Notice 358 of June 1, 1972, 37 FR 11906.


<R05>
Sec. 2.05-20  Internal waters and inland waters.

    (a) Internal waters and, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, inland waters mean:
    (1) With respect to the United States, the waters shoreward of the 
territorial sea baseline.
    (2) With respect to any foreign country, the waters shoreward of the 
baseline of its territorial sea, as recognized by the United States.
    (b) Inland waters, as used in 33 U.S.C. Chapter 3, means the waters 
shoreward of the lines described in part 80 of this chapter, except the 
Great Lakes and their connecting and tributary waters as far east as 
Montreal, the waters of the Mississippi River between its source and the 
Huey P. Long Bridge and all of its tributaries emptying thereinto and 
their tributaries, that part of the Atchafalaya River above its junction 
with the Plaquemine-Morgan City alternate waterway, and the Red River of 
the North.

    \2\ In various laws administered and enforced by the Coast Guard, 
the terms ``State'' and ``United States'' are defined to include some or 
all of the territories and possessions of the United States. The 
definitions in Secs. 2.05-25 and 2.05-30 should be considered as 
supplementary to these statutory definitions and not as interpretive of 
them.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

waters of the United States, navigable waters, and territorial waters 
mean, except where Congress has designated them not to be navigable 
waters of the United States:
    (1) Territorial seas of the United States;
    (2) Internal waters of the United States that are subject to tidal 
influence; and
    (3) Internal waters of the United States not subject to tidal 
influence that:
    (i) Are or have been used, or are or have been susceptible for use, 
by themselves or in connection with other waters, as highways for 
substantial interstate or foreign commerce, notwithstanding natural or 
man-made obstructions that require portage, or
    (ii) A governmental or non-governmental body, having expertise in 
waterway improvement, determines to be capable of improvement at a 
reasonable cost (a favorable balance between

[[Page 30]]

cost and need) to provide, by themselves or in connection with other 
waters, highways for substantial interstate or foreign commerce.
    (b) Navigable waters of the United States and navigable waters, as 
used in sections 311 and 312 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 
as amended, 33 U.S.C. 1321 and 1322, mean:
    (1) Navigable waters of the United States as defined in paragraph 
(a) of this section and all waters within the United States tributary 
thereto; and
    (2) Other waters over which the Federal Government may exercise 
Constitutional authority.


<R05>
Sec. 2.05-27  Waters subject to tidal influence; waters subject to the ebb 
and flow of the tide; mean high water.

    Waters subject to tidal influence and waters subject to the ebb and 
flow of the tide are interpreted as waters below mean high water. ``Mean 
high water'' is the average of the height of the diurnal high water at a 
particular location measured over a lunar cycle period of 19 years. 
These terms do not include waters above mean high water caused by flood 
flows, storms, high winds, seismic waves, or other non-lunar phenomena.

(Secs. 107, 108, Pub. L. 97-322, 96 Stat. 1582 (33 U.S.C. 495, 499, 502,

waters over which the United States has jurisdiction. \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See footnote 2 to Sec. 2.05-25.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and waters 
over which the United States has jurisdiction mean:
    (a) Navigable waters of the United States;
    (b) Other waters that are located on lands, owned by the United 
States, with respect to which jurisdiction has been accepted in 
accordance with 33 U.S.C. 733 by the authorized federal officer having 
custody, control, or other authority over them;
    (c) Other waters that are located on lands, owned by the United

contiguous to the territorial sea, including zones contiguous to the 
territorial sea of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (to the extent 
consistent with the Covenant and the United Nations Trusteeship 
Agreement), and the United States overseas territories and possessions. 
The EEZ extends to a distance 200 nautical miles from the baseline from 
which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. In cases where the 
maritime boundary with a neighboring State remains to be determined, the 
boundary of the EEZ will be determined by the United States and the 
other State concerned in accordance with equitable principles.

<R05>
Sec. 3.01-1  General description.

    (a) The structure of the Coast Guard's general organization for the 
performance of its assigned functions and duties consists of the 
Commandant, assisted by the Headquarters staff, two Area Offices to act 
as intermediate echelons of operational command, and District Offices to 
provide regional direction and coordination. The District Offices 
operate within defined geographical areas of the United States, its 
territories, and possessions, including portions of the high seas 
adjacent thereto. The description of the districts is established by the 
Commandant.
    (b) The two Coast Guard Areas are the Atlantic Area (see Sec. 3.04-
1) and the Pacific Area (see Sec. 3.04-3). The Coast Guard Area 
Commander is in command of a Coast Guard Area; the offices are referred 
to as a Coast Guard Area Office. The office of the Commander, Atlantic 
Area, is located in the Fifth Coast Guard District and the Commander, 
Atlantic Area, also serves as the Fifth District Commander. The office 
of the Commander, Pacific Area, is located in the Eleventh Coast Guard 
District and the Commander, Pacific Area, also serves as the Eleventh 
District Commander. Area Commanders have the responsibility of 
determining when operational matters require the coordination of forces 
and facilities of more than one district.
    (c) The Coast Guard District Commander is in command of a Coast 
Guard District and his office may be referred to as a Coast Guard 
District Office. (See Sec. 1.01-1 of this subchapter.)
    (d) An Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, is in command of a 
Marine Inspection Zone and his office may be referred to as a Coast 
Guard Marine Inspection Office. (See Sec. 1.01-20 of this subchapter.)
    (e) The Captain of the Port is in command of a Captain of the Port 
Area and his office may be referred to as a Captain of the Port Office. 
(See Sec. 1.01-30 of this subchapter.)
    (f) Each Captain of the Port Area and each Marine Inspection Zone 
described in this part also includes the United States territorial seas 
adjacent to the described Area or Zone for the purpose of enforcing or 
acting pursuant to a statute effective in the United States territorial 
seas. Each Captain of the Port Area and each Marine Inspection Zone 
described in this part also includes the Contiguous Zone adjacent to the 
Area or Zone for the purpose of enforcing or acting pursuant to a 
statute effective in the Contiguous Zone. (See Secs. 2.05-5 and 2.05-
15.) Each Captain of the Port Zone and each Marine Inspection Zone 
described in this part also includes the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) 
adjacent to the area for the purpose of enforcing or acting pursuant to 
a statute effective in the EEZ.
    (g) Geographic coordinates expressed in terms of latitude or 
longitude, or both, are not intended for plotting on maps or charts 
whose referenced horizontal datum is the North American Datum of 1983 
(NAD 83), unless such geographic coordinates are expressly labeled NAD 
83. Geographic coordinates without the NAD 83 reference may be plotted 
on maps or charts referenced to NAD 83 only after application of the

[[Page 33]]

appropriate corrections that are published on the particular map or 
chart being used.

 Subpart 13.01--Gold and Silver Lifesaving Medals, Bars, and Miniatures


<R05>
Sec. 13.01-1  General.

    Lifesaving Medals of gold and silver, designated as the Gold 
Lifesaving Medal and the Silver Lifesaving Medal, respectively, may be 
awarded by the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, hereinafter called the 
Commandant, under 14 U.S.C. 500 and the regulations in this subpart to 
persons rescuing or endeavoring to rescue any other person from 
drowning, shipwreck or other peril of the water.


<R05>
Sec. 13.01-5  Gold and Silver Lifesaving Medals.

    Lifesaving Medals may be awarded to any person who rescues or 
endeavors to rescue any other person from drowning, shipwreck or other 
peril of the water. In order for a person to be eligible for a 
Lifesaving Medal the rescue or attempted rescue must take place in 
waters within the United States or subject to the jurisdiction thereof, 
or if the rescue or attempted rescue takes place outside such waters, 
one or the other of the parties must be a citizen of the United States 
or from a vessel or aircraft owned or operated by citizens of the United 
States. If such rescue or attempted rescue is made at the risk of one's 
own life and evidences extreme and heroic daring, the medal shall be of 
gold. If such rescue or attempted rescue is not sufficiently 
distinguished to deserve the medal of gold but evidences the exercise of 
such signal exertion as to merit recognition, the medal shall be of 
silver. Lifesaving Medals may be awarded posthumously.


<R05>
Sec. 13.01-10  Gold and silver bars.

    No person shall receive more than one Gold Lifesaving Medal and one 
Silver Lifesaving Medal; but any person who has received or may 
hereafter receive a Gold or Silver Lifesaving Medal and who again 
performs an act which would entitle him to receive another medal of the 
same class, may be awarded, in lieu of a second medal of the same class, 
a gold or silver bar, as the case may be, to be worn with the medal 
already bestowed, and for every such additional act, an additional bar 
may be awarded. Gold and silver bars may be awarded posthumously.


<R05>
Sec. 13.01-15  Applications and recommendations.

    (a) All administrative details pertaining to the award of Lifesaving 
Medals are under the jurisdiction of the Commandant. Applications and 
recommendations for the award of a Lifesaving Medal may be filed by or 
in behalf of the person making or attempting a rescue under 
circumstances contemplated by the regulations in this subpart. 
Applications or recommendations for award of medals or requests for 
information pertaining thereto should be addressed to the Commander of 
the Coast Guard District, hereinafter called the District Commander, 
where the incident took place. (See part 3 of this subchapter for 
descriptions of Coast Guard Districts.) If the District is unknown, or 
if the incident took place outside any such district, applications and 
recommendations should be addressed to the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, 
Washington, D.C. 20593.

[[Page 62]]

    (b) Completed applications must include:
    (1) Satisfactory evidence of the services performed, in the form of 
affidavits, made by eyewitnesses of good repute and standing testifying 
of their own knowledge. The opinion of witnesses that the person for 
whom an award is sought imperiled his or her own life or made signal 
exertions is not sufficient but the affidavits must set forth in detail 
all facts and occurrences tending to show clearly in what manner and to 
what extent life was risked or signal exertions made so that the 
Commandant may judge for himself as to the degree of merit involved.
    (2) The precise locality of the rescue or attempted rescue, whether 
from waters within the United States or subject to the jurisdiction 
thereof, or if the rescue or attempted rescue is outside such waters, 
whether one or the other of the parties is a citizen of the United 
States, or from a vessel or aircraft owned or operated by citizens of 
the United States, shall be stated. The date, time of day, nature of the 
weather, condition of the water, the names of all persons present when 
practicable, the names of all persons rendering assistance, and all 
pertinent circumstances and data, showing the precise nature and degree 
of risk involved, should be stated.
    (c) Recommendations must include:
    (1) As much of the information indicated in paragraphs (b) (1) and 
(2) of this section which is available to the person making the 
recommendation. Upon receipt the Commandant or the cognizant District 
Commander shall cause such recommendation to be referred to an 
investigating officer who shall cause to be developed such additional 
information and evidence as is deemed necessary to either (i) terminate 
the investigation as containing insufficient justification to continue 
further, or (ii) to complete the application for submission to the 
Commandant for his final determination.
    (d) Either the Commandant or the District Commander may, without any 
application or recommendation, of his own motion, order an informal 
investigation into such an incident under Chapter II, of the Coast Guard 
Supplement to the Manual for Courts-Martial (CG-241).
    (e) Affidavits required by this subpart shall be made before an 
officer duly authorized to administer oaths and if taken before an 
officer without an official seal, his official character must be 
certified by the proper officer of a court of record, under the seal 
thereof, unless the oath be taken before an officer of the Armed Forces 
authorized to administer oaths under the provisions of Article 136, UCMJ 
(10 U.S.C. 936).
    (f) Cognizant District Commanders shall act upon all applications 
and recommendations submitted to them from whatever source and shall:
    (1) Forward completed applications with his recommendations to the 
Commandant for his consideration and determination; or,
    (2) Inform the applicant or the person submitting the recommendation 
that he considers such application or recommendation incomplete together 
with the reasons therefor and that a period of 90 days will be allowed 
for additional evidence to be provided upon the expiration of which he 
will file the application or recommendation without further action.
    (g) Whenever the cognizant District Commander shall deem such action 
necessary, he may require that the aforementioned affidavits shall be 
accompanied by a certificate showing the affiants to be credible 
persons, certified by some U.S. Officer, such as a judge or clerk of a 
U.S. Court, district attorney, collector of customs, postmaster, or 
officer of the Armed Forces. If the affiant is a citizen or resident of 
a foreign country and if the affidavit is executed in such foreign 
country, the credibility certificate may be executed by an officer of 
such foreign country, who occupies an official position similar to the 
aforementioned U.S. officers.
    (h) The decision of the Commandant on all applications, 
recommendations, and investigations for the Gold or Silver Lifesaving 
Medals shall be final.

laws with respect to the vessel involved is necessary in the interest of 
national defense and, an outline of the facts upon which such 
certification is based. The Coast Guard District Commander (or his 
designated representative or the designated representative of the 
Commandant, as the case may be) shall promptly examine every application 
for the purpose of determining whether the necessity for prompt action 
is such as to require that the waiver be made effective by him without 
reference to the Commandant. In any case in which it appears to the 
Coast Guard officer concerned that reference of the application to the 
Commandant for action would not delay the sailing of the vessel or 
otherwise be contrary to the interest of national defense, the 
application shall be so referred. In all other cases such Coast Guard 
officer shall give immediate consideration to the application and if he 
reaches the conclusion that the urgency of the situation outweighs the 
marine hazard involved, then such waiver shall be made effective in 
regard to such vessel to the extent and under the circumstances 
specified by him.
    (c) The Coast Guard officer making such a waiver effective pursuant 
to paragraph (b) of this section shall immediately prepare, in 
triplicate, an order setting forth the name of the vessel involved, the 
laws (also regulations, if any) with respect to which the waiver is 
effective, the extent to which compliance with such laws (also 
regulations, if any) is waived, and the period for which the waiver 
shall be effective. If practicable, one copy of this order shall be 
delivered to the master of the vessel involved before such vessel sails. 
In any case where the order is not delivered to the master, it shall be 
delivered to the owner, operator, or agent of the vessel without delay. 
One copy of the order shall be transmitted to the Commandant and the 
remaining copy kept on file.
    (d) In any case of extreme urgency the application for a waiver may 
be made orally and if the Coast Guard District Commander (or his 
designated representative or the designated representative of the 
Commandant, as the case may be) reaches the conclusion referred to in 
paragraph (b) of this section, the waiver shall be made effective 
without further delay, subject to the condition that the application be 
reduced to writing and delivered within such period after the date of 
the oral request as the Coast Guard officer making the waiver effective 
shall specify in the order.
    (e) No penalty shall be imposed because of failure to comply with 
any provision of law (or regulation, if any), the waiver of which has 
been made effective pursuant to the requirements in this section.

to the master of the vessel involved before such vessel sails. In any 
case where the waiver order is not delivered to the master, it shall be 
delivered to the owner, operator, or agent of the vessel without delay. 
One copy of the waiver order shall be delivered to the Commander, 
Military Sea Transportation Service, or his duly designated 
representative, who submitted the application. One copy of the waiver

hereby waive in the interest of national defense compliance with the

promulgated thereunder in part 146 of this chapter to the extent that no 
quantitative restrictions, based on considerations of isolation and 
remoteness, shall be required by the Coast Guard for commercial vessels 
loading or unloading explosives at the Department of Defense waterfront 
installations. This waiver shall not relieve a commercial vessel loading 
or unloading explosives at the Department of Defense waterfront 
installations from the requirement of securing a permit from the Coast 
Guard for such operations with respect to quantitative or other 
restrictions imposed by the Coast Guard on the basis of each vessel's 
ability to meet prescribed stowage and handling requirements.

affirmative defenses that the respondent intends to assert at the 
hearing. The answer must admit or deny each numbered paragraph of the

[[Page 76]]

Compensation and Liability Act (42 U.S.C. 9609(b)), by the filing of--

time after the respondent has served a responsive pleading, but before

notice is due to a request by the Attorney General--in accordance with

relief, for failure of another party to--
    (1) Comply with the requirements of this part or with any order of 
the ALJ;

<R05>
Sec. 20.605  Depositions.

    (a) The ALJ may order a deposition only upon a showing of good cause 
and upon a finding that--

to administer oaths in the place where the deposition is to be taken.
    (c) Upon a showing of good cause the ALJ may enter, and serve upon 
the parties, an order to obtain the testimony of the witness.
    (d) If the deposition of a public or private corporation, 
partnership, association, or governmental agency is ordered, the 
organization named must designate one or more officers, directors, or 
agents to testify on its behalf, and may set forth, for each person

provisions of 49 CFR part 9 with respect to Coast Guard witnesses, the 
designated persons shall testify as to matters reasonably known to them.
    (e) Each witness deposed shall be placed under oath or affirmation, 
and the other parties shall have the right to cross-examine.

transcription must be read by or read to the deponent, subscribed by the 
deponent, and certified by the person before whom the deposition was 
taken.
    (h) Subject to objections to the questions and responses that were 
noted at the taking of the deposition and that would have been sustained

any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition 
or who had notice of the deposition.
    (i) The party requesting the deposition shall make appropriate 
arrangements for necessary facilities and personnel.
    (j) During the taking of a deposition, a party or the witness may 
request suspension of the deposition on the grounds of bad faith in the 
conduct of the examination, oppression of the witness or party, or 
improper questioning or conduct. Upon request for suspension, the 
deposition will be adjourned. The objecting party or witness must 
immediately move the ALJ for a ruling on the objection(s). The ALJ may 
then limit the scope or manner of the taking of the deposition.
    (k) When a deposition is taken in a foreign country, it may be taken 
before a person having power to administer oaths in that location, or 
before a secretary of an embassy or legation, consul general, consul, 
vice consul or consular agent of the United States, or before such other 
person or officer as may be agreed upon by the parties by written 
stipulation filed with the ALJ.
    (l) Objection to taking a deposition because of the disqualification 
of the officer before whom it is to be taken is waived unless made 
before the taking of the deposition begins, or as soon as the 
disqualification becomes known or could have been discovered with 
reasonable diligence.
    (m) A deposition may be taken by telephone conference call upon such 
terms, conditions, and arrangements as are prescribed in the order of 
the ALJ.
    (n) The testimony at a deposition hearing may be recorded on 
videotape, upon such terms, conditions and arrangements as are 
prescribed in the order of the ALJ, at the expense of the party 
requesting the recording. The video recording may be in conjunction with 
an oral examination by telephone conference held pursuant to paragraph 
(m) of this section. After the deposition has been taken, and copies of 
the video recording are provided to parties requesting them, the person 
recording the deposition shall immediately place the videotape in a 
sealed envelope or a sealed videotape container, attaching to it a 
statement identifying the proceeding and the deponent and certifying as 
to the authenticity of the video recording, and return the videotape by 
accountable means to the ALJ. The deposition becomes a part of the 
record of the proceedings in the same manner as a transcribed 
deposition. The videotape, if admitted into evidence, will be played 
during the hearing and transcribed into the record by the reporter.


<R05>
Sec. 20.606  Protective orders.

    (a) In considering a motion for an order of discovery--or a motion, 
by a party or other person from whom discovery is sought, to reconsider 
or amend an order of discovery--the ALJ may enter any order that justice 
requires, to protect a person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, 
or undue burden or expense. This order may--
    (1) Confine discovery to specific terms and conditions, such as a 
particular time and place;
    (2) Confine discovery to a method other than that selected by the

    (6) Require that the person from whom discovery is sought file 
specific documents or information under seal for opening at the 
direction of the ALJ.
    (b) When a person from whom discovery is sought seeks a protective 
order, the ALJ may let him or her make all or part of the showing of 
good cause in camera. The ALJ shall record any proceedings in camera. If 
he or she enters a protective order, he or she shall seal any 
proceedings so recorded. These shall be releasable only as required by 
law.
    (c) Upon motion by a person from whom discovery is sought, the ALJ 
may--
    (1) Restrict or defer disclosure by a party either of the name of a 
witness or, if the witness comes from the Coast Guard, of any prior 
statement of the witness; and
    (2) Prescribe other appropriate measures to protect a witness.
    (d) The ALJ will give any party an adequate opportunity to prepare 
for cross-examination or other presentation concerning witnesses and 
statement subject to protective orders.


<R05>

been adverse to the party.
    (b) Order that, for the purposes of the proceeding, designated facts 
are established.
    (c) Order that the party not introduce into evidence--or otherwise 
rely upon, in support of any claim or defense--the evidence that was 
withheld.
    (d) Order that the party not introduce into evidence, or otherwise 
use in the hearing, information obtained in discovery.
    (e) Allow the use of secondary evidence to show what the evidence 
withheld would have shown.


<R05>
Sec. 20.608  Subpoenas.

    (a) Any party may request the ALJ to issue a subpoena for the 
attendance of a person, the giving of testimony, or the production of 
books, papers, documents, or any other relevant evidence during 
discovery or for any hearing. Any party seeking a subpoena from the ALJ 
shall request its issuance by motion.
    (b) An ALJ may, for good cause shown, apply to the United States 
District Court for the issuance of an order compelling the appearance 
and testimony of a witness or the production of evidence.
    (c) A person serving a subpoena shall prepare a written statement 
setting forth either the date, time, and manner of service or the reason 
for failure of service. He or she shall swear to or affirm the 
statement, attach it to a copy of the subpoena, and return it to the ALJ 
who issued the subpoena.
    (d) Coast Guard investigating officers have separate subpoena power 
in S&R proceedings under 46 CFR 5.301.


<R05>
Sec. 20.609  Motions to quash or modify.

    (a) A person to whom a subpoena is directed may, by motion with 
notice to the party requesting the subpoena, ask the ALJ to quash or 
modify the subpoena.
    (b) Except when made at a hearing, the motion must be filed:
    (1) 10 days or less after service of a subpoena compelling the 
appearance and testimony of a witness or the production of evidence or
    (2) At or before the time specified in the subpoena for compliance, 
whichever is earlier.
    (c) If the subpoena is served at a hearing, the person to whom it is 
directed may, in person at the hearing or in writing within a reasonable 
time fixed by the ALJ, ask the ALJ to quash or modify it.
    (d) The ALJ may quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable 
or requires evidence not relevant to any matter in issue.

<R05>
Sec. 20.701  Standard of proof.

    The party that bears the burden of proof shall prove his or her case 
or affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence.


<R05>

of a motion, request, or order bears the burden of proof.


<R05>
Sec. 20.703  Presumptions.

    In each administrative hearing, a presumption--
    (a) Imposes on the party against whom it lies the burden of going 
forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption; but
    (b) Does not shift the burden of proof in the sense of the risk of 
non-persuasion.


<R05>
Sec. 20.704  Scheduling and notice of hearings.

    (a) With due regard for the convenience of the parties, and of their 
representatives or witnesses, the ALJ shall, as early as possible, fix

appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 20.705  Failure to appear.

    The ALJ may enter a default under Sec. 20.310 against a respondent 
threatening to fail, or having failed, to appear at a hearing unless,--
    (a) Before the time for the hearing, the respondent shows good cause 
why neither the respondent nor his or her representative can appear; or,
    (b) 30 days or less after an order to show good cause, the 
respondent shows good cause for his or her failure to appear.


<R05>
Sec. 20.706  Witnesses.

    (a) Each witness shall testify under oath or affirmation.
    (b) If a witness fails or refuses to answer any question the ALJ 
finds proper, the failure or refusal constitutes grounds for the ALJ to 
strike all or part of the testimony given by the witness or to take any 
other measure he or she deems appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 20.707  Telephonic testimony.

    (a) The ALJ may order the taking of the testimony of a witness by 
telephonic conference call. A person presenting evidence may by motion 
ask for the taking of testimony by this means. The arrangement of the 
call must let each participant listen to and speak to each other within 
the hearing of the ALJ, who will ensure the full identification of each 
so the reporter can create a proper record.
    (b) The ALJ may issue a subpoena directing a witness to testify by 
telephonic conference call. The subpoena in any such instance issues 
under the procedures in Sec. 20.608.


<R05>

argument so far as he or she deems appropriate.
    (b) Before the ALJ decides the case, and upon terms he or she finds

conclusions of law, or both. Any party may waive this right. If all 
parties waive it, then the ALJ may issue an oral order at the close of 
the hearing.
    (c) Any oral argument, brief, or proposed findings of fact and 
conclusions of law form part of the record of the proceeding, as 
described in Sec. 20.903.


<R04>
                           Subpart H--Evidence


<R05>
Sec. 20.801  General.

    Any party may present his or her case or defense by oral, 
documentary, or demonstrative evidence; submit rebuttal evidence; and 
conduct any cross-examination that may be necessary for a full and true 
disclosure of the facts.


<R05>
Sec. 20.802  Admissibility of evidence.

    (a) The ALJ may admit any relevant oral, documentary, or 
demonstrative evidence, unless privileged. Relevant evidence is evidence 
tending to make the existence of any material fact more probable or less 
probable than it would be without the evidence.
    (b) The ALJ may exclude evidence if its probative value is 
substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice, by confusion of the 
issues, or by reasonable concern for undue delay, waste of time, or 
needless presentation of cumulative evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 20.803  Hearsay evidence.

    Hearsay evidence is admissible in proceedings governed by this part. 
The ALJ may consider the fact that evidence is hearsay when determining 
its probative value.


<R05>
Sec. 20.804  Objections and offers of proof.

    (a) Any party objecting to the admission or exclusion of evidence 
shall concisely state the grounds. A ruling on every objection must 
appear in the record. No party may raise an objection to the admission 
or exclusion of evidence on appeal unless he or she raised it before the 
ALJ.
    (b) Whenever evidence is objected to, the party offering it may make 
an offer of proof, which must appear in the record.


<R05>
Sec. 20.805  Proprietary information.

    (a) The ALJ may limit introduction of evidence or issue such 
protective or other orders as in his or her judgment are consistent with 
the object of preventing undue disclosure of proprietary matters, 
including, among others, ones of a commercial nature.
    (b) When the ALJ determines that information in a document 
containing proprietary matters should be made available to another 
party, the ALJ may direct the party possessing the document to prepare a 
non-proprietary summary or extract of it. The summary or extract may be 
admitted as evidence in the record.
    (c) If the ALJ determines that a non-proprietary summary or extract 
is inadequate and that proprietary matters must form part of the record 
to avert prejudice to a party, the ALJ may so advise the parties and 
arrange access to the evidence for a party or representative.


<R05>
Sec. 20.806  Official notice.

    The ALJ may take official notice of such matters as could courts, or 
of other facts within the specialized knowledge of the Coast Guard as an 
expert body. When all or part of a decision rests on the official notice 
of a material fact not appearing in the evidence in the record, the 
decision must state as much; and any party, upon timely request, shall 
receive an opportunity to rebut the fact.


<R05>
Sec. 20.807  Exhibits and documents.

    (a) Each exhibit must be numbered and marked for identification by 
the party offering it. The original of each exhibit so marked, whether 
or not offered or admitted into evidence, must be filed and retained in 
the record of the proceeding, unless the ALJ permits the substitution of 
a copy. The party introducing each exhibit so marked

[[Page 84]]

shall supply a copy of the exhibit to the ALJ and to every party to the 
proceeding.
    (b) Unless the ALJ directs otherwise, each party who would offer an 
exhibit upon direct examination shall make it available to every other 
party for inspection 15 days or more before the hearing. The ALJ will 
deem admitted the authenticity of each exhibit submitted before the 
hearing unless a party either files written objection and serves it on 
all parties or shows good cause for failure to do both.
    (c) In class II civil penalty proceedings under 33 U.S.C. 
1321(b)(6), each exhibit introduced by an interested person must be 
marked, and filed and retained in the record of the proceeding, unless 
the ALJ permits the substitution of a copy. The interested person shall 
supply a copy of the exhibit to the ALJ and to every party to the 
proceeding. The requirements of paragraph (b) of this section apply to 
any interested person who would offer an exhibit upon direct 
examination.


<R05>
Sec. 20.808  Written testimony.

    The ALJ may enter into the record the written testimony of a 
witness. The witness shall be, or have been, available for oral cross-
examination. The statement must be sworn to, or affirmed, under penalty 
of perjury.


<R05>
Sec. 20.809  Stipulations.

    Any party or interested person may stipulate, in writing, at any 
stage of the proceeding, or orally at the hearing, to any pertinent fact 
or other matter fairly susceptible of stipulation. A stipulation binds 
all parties to it.


<R04>
                          Subpart I--Decisions


<R05>
Sec. 20.901  Summary decisions.

    (a) Any party may move for a summary decision in all or any part of 
the proceeding on the grounds that there is no genuine issue of material 
fact and that the party is entitled to a decision as a matter of law. 
The party must file the motion no later than 15 days before the date 
fixed for the hearing and may include supporting affidavits with the 
motion. Any other party, 10 days or less after service of a motion for 
summary decision, may serve opposing affidavits or countermove for 
summary decision. The ALJ may set the matter for argument and call for 
the submission of briefs.
    (b) The ALJ may grant the motion if the filed affidavits, the filed 
documents, the material obtained by discovery or otherwise, or matters 
officially noted show that there is no genuine issue of material fact 
and that a party is entitled to a summary decision as a matter of law.
    (c) Each affidavit must set forth such matters as would be 
admissible in evidence and must show affirmatively that the affiant is 
competent to testify to the matters stated in the affidavit. Once a 
party has moved for summary decision and supported his or her motion as 
provided in this section, no party opposing the motion may rest upon the 
mere allegations or denials of facts contained in his or her own 
pleadings. The response to the motion, by affidavit or as otherwise 
provided in this section, must provide a specific basis to show that 
there is a genuine issue of material fact for the hearing.
    (d) If it appears from the affidavit of a party opposing the motion 
that this party cannot, for reasons stated, present by affidavit matters 
essential to justify his or her opposition, the ALJ may deny the motion 
for summary decision, may order a continuance to enable the obtaining of 
information, or may make such other order as is just.
    (e) No denial of all or any part of a motion for summary decision is 
subject to interlocutory appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 20.902  Decisions of the ALJ.

    (a) After closing the record of the proceeding, the ALJ shall 
prepare a decision containing--
    (1) A finding on each material issue of fact and conclusion of law, 
and the basis for each finding;
    (2) The disposition of the case, including any appropriate order;
    (3) The date upon which the decision will become effective;
    (4) A statement of further right to appeal; and,
    (5) If no hearing was held, a statement of the right of any 
interested person to petition the Commandant to set aside the decision.

[[Page 85]]

    (b) The decision of the ALJ must rest upon a consideration of the 
whole record of the proceedings.
    (c) The ALJ may, upon motion of any party or in his or her own 
discretion, render the initial decision from the bench (orally) at the 
close of the hearing and prepare and serve a written order on the 
parties or their authorized representatives. In rendering his or her 
decision from the bench, the ALJ shall state the issues in the case and 
make clear, on the record, his or her findings of fact and conclusions 
of law.
    (d) If the ALJ renders the initial decision orally, and if a party 
asks for a copy, the Hearing Docket Clerk shall furnish a copy excerpted 
from the transcript of the record. The date of the decision is the date 
of the oral rendering of the decision by the ALJ.


<R05>
Sec. 20.903  Records of proceedings.

    (a) The transcript of testimony at the hearing, all exhibits 
received into evidence, any items marked as exhibits and not received 
into evidence, all motions, all applications, all requests, and all 
rulings constitute the official record of a proceeding. This record also 
includes any motions or other matters regarding the disqualification of 
the ALJ.
    (b) Any person may examine the record of a proceeding at the U. S. 
Coast Guard Administrative Law Judge Docketing Center; Room 412; 40 S. 
Gay Street; Baltimore, MD 21201-4022. Any person may obtain a copy of 
part or all of the record after payment of reasonable costs for 
duplicating it in accordance with 49 CFR part 7.


<R05>
Sec. 20.904  Reopening.

    (a) To the extent permitted by law, the ALJ may, for good cause 
shown in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, reopen the 
record of a proceeding to take added evidence.
    (b) Any party may move to reopen the record of a proceeding 30 days 
or less after the closing of the record.
    (1) Each motion to reopen the record must clearly set forth the 
facts that the movant would try to prove and the grounds for reopening 
the record.
    (2) Any party who does not respond to any motion to reopen the 
record waives any objection to the motion.
    (c) The ALJ may reopen the record of a proceeding if he or she 
believes that any change in fact or law, or that the public interest, 
warrants reopening it.
    (d) The filing of a motion to reopen the record of a proceeding does 
not affect any period for appeals specified in subpart J of this part, 
except that the filing of such a motion tolls the running of whatever 
time remains in the period for appeals until either the ALJ acts on the 
motion or the party filing it withdraws it.
    (e)(1) At any time, a party may file a petition to reopen with the 
Docketing Center for the ALJ to rescind any order suspending or revoking 
a merchant mariner's license, certificate of registry, or document if--
    (i) The order rests on a conviction--
    (A) For violation of a dangerous-drug law;
    (B) Of an offense that would prevent the issuance or renewal of the 
license, certificate, or document; or
    (C) Of an offense described in subparagraph 205(a)(3)(A) or (B) of 
the National Driver Register Act of 1982 (23 U.S.C. 401, note); and
    (ii) The respondent submits a specific order of court to the effect 
that the conviction has been unconditionally set aside for all purposes.
    (2) The ALJ, however, may not rescind his or her order on account of 
any law that provides for a subsequent conditional setting-aside, 
modification, or expunging of the order of court, by way of granting 
clemency or other relief after the conviction has become final, without 
regard to whether punishment was imposed.
    (f) Three years or less after an S&R proceeding has resulted in 
revocation of a license, certificate, or document, the respondent may 
file a motion for reopening of the proceeding to modify the order of 
revocation with the ALJ Docketing Center.
    (1) Any motion to reopen the record must clearly state why the basis 
for the order of revocation is no longer valid and how the issuance of a 
new license, certificate, or document is compatible with the requirement 
of good discipline and safety at sea.
    (2) Any party who does not respond to any petition to reopen the 
record waives any objection to the motion.

initial decision 45 days or less after the temporary suspension.

<R05>
Sec. 20.1301  Purpose.

    This subpart contains evidentiary rules that apply only in certain 
circumstances in S&R proceedings. They supplement, not supplant, the 
evidentiary rules in subpart H.

Sec. 20.1303  Authentication and certification of extracts from shipping 
articles, logbooks, and the like.

    (a) The investigating officer, the Coast Guard representative, any

and identify himself or herself by rank or title and by duty station.


<R05>
Sec. 20.1305  Admissibility and weight of entries from logbooks.

    (a) Any entry in any official logbook of a vessel concerning an 
offense enumerated in 46 U.S.C. 11501, made in substantial compliance

evidence and constitutes prima facie evidence of the facts recited.
    (b) Any entry in any such logbook made in substantial compliance 
with the procedural requirements of 46 U.S.C. 11502 may receive added 
weight from the ALJ.


<R05>
Sec. 20.1307  Use of judgments of conviction.

    (a) A judgment of conviction by a Federal court is conclusive in any 
S&R proceeding under this part concerning any act or offense described 
in 46 U.S.C. 7703 or 7704 when the act or offense is the same as in the 
Federal conviction.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no judgment 
of conviction by a State court is conclusive in any S&R proceeding under 
this part concerning any act or offense described in 46 U.S.C. 7703 or 
7704, even when an act or offense forming the basis of the charge in the 
proceeding is the same as in the State conviction. But the judgment is 
admissible in evidence and constitutes substantial evidence adverse to 
the respondent.
    (c) A judgment of conviction by a Federal or State court for a 
violation is conclusive in the proceeding if an S&R proceeding alleges 
conviction for--
    (1) A violation of a dangerous-drug law;
    (2) An offense that would prevent the issuance or renewal of a 
merchant mariner's license, certificate of registry, or document; or
    (3) An offense described in subparagraph 205(a)(3)(A) or (B) of the 
National Driver Register Act of 1982 (23 U.S.C.S. 401, note).
    (d) If the respondent participates in the scheme of a State for the 
expungement of convictions, and if he or she pleads guilty or no contest 
or, by order of the trial court, has to attend classes, contribute time 
or money, receive treatment, submit to any manner

[[Page 90]]

of probation or supervision, or forgo appeal of the finding of the trial 
court, the Coast Guard regards him or her, for the purposes of 46 U.S.C. 
7703 or 7704, as having received a conviction. The Coast Guard does not 
consider the conviction expunged without proof that the expungement is 
due to the conviction's having been in error.
    (e) No respondent may challenge the jurisdiction of a Federal or 
State court in any proceeding under 46 U.S.C. 7703 or 7704.


<R05>

with the Coast Guard before entry of findings and conclusions.

    (a) The prior disciplinary record of the respondent is admissible

when offered by the Coast Guard representative to impeach the 
credibility of evidence offered by the respondent.
    (c) The use of a judgment of conviction is permissible on the terms 
prescribed by Sec. 20.1307.


<R05>
Sec. 20.1311  Admissions by respondent.

    No person may testify regarding admissions made by the respondent 
during an investigation under 46 CFR part 4, except to impeach the 
credibility of evidence offered by the respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 20.1313  Medical examination of respondents.

    In any proceeding in which the physical or mental condition of the 
respondent is relevant, the ALJ may order him or her to undergo a 
medical examination. Any examination ordered by the ALJ is conducted, at 
Federal expense, by a physician designated by the ALJ. If the respondent 
fails or refuses to undergo any such examination, the failure or refusal 
receives due weight and may be sufficient for the ALJ to infer that the 
results would have been adverse to the respondent.


<R05>

    (a) The prior disciplinary record of the respondent comprises the 
following items less than 10 years old:

by the respondent.
    (2) Final agency action by the Coast Guard on any S&R proceeding in

<R05>
Sec. 25.107  Who may present claims.

    (a) General rules:
    (1) A claim for property loss or damage may be presented by anyone 
having an interest in the property, including an insurer or other 
subrogee, unless the interest is barred under Sec. 25.109(a).
    (2) A claim for personal injury may be presented by the person 
injured.
    (3) A claim based on death may be presented by the executor or 
administrator of the decedent's estate, or any other person legally 
entitled to assert such a claim under local law. The claimant's status 
must be stated in the claim.
    (4) A claim for medical, hospital, or burial expenses may be 
presented by any person who by reason of family relationship has, in 
fact, incurred the expenses.
    (b) A joint claim must be presented in the names of and signed by, 
the joint claimants, and the settlement must be made payable to the 
joint claimants.
    (c) A claim may be presented by a duly authorized agent, legal 
representative or survivor, if it is presented in the name of the 
claimant. If the claim is not signed by the claimant, the agent, legal 
representative, or survivor shall indicate their title or legal capacity 
and provide evidence of their authority to present the claim.
    (d) Where the same claimant has a claim for damage to or loss of 
property and a claim for personal injury or a claim based on death 
arising out of the same incident, they must be combined in one claim.


<R05>
Sec. 25.109  Insurance and other subrogated claims.

    (a) The claims of an insured (subrogor) and an insurer (subrogee) 
for damages arising out of the same incident constitute a single claim. 
The total award of combined claims may not exceed the monetary 
jurisdiction of the settlement authority. If the total award of the 
combined claims exceeds, or is expected to exceed, a settlement

[[Page 94]]

authority's limits, the settlement authority is not permitted to 
consider either, and the claim file will be forwarded to an appropriate 
settlement authority.
    (b) An insured (subrogor) and an insurer (subrogee) may file a claim 
jointly or separately. If the insurer has fully reimbursed the insured, 
payment will only be made to the insurer. If separate claims are filed, 
the settlement will be made payable to each claimant to the extent of 
that claimant's undisputed interest. If joint claims are filed, the 
settlement will be sent to the insurer.
    (c) Each claimant shall include with a claim, a written disclosure 
concerning insurance coverage including:
    (1) The names and addresses of all insurers;
    (2) The kind and amount of insurance;
    (3) The policy number;
    (4) Whether a claim has been or will be presented to an insurer, 
and, if so, the amount of that claim; and whether the insurer has paid 
the claim in whole or in part, or has indicated payment will be made.
    (d) Each subrogee shall substantiate an interest or right to file a 
claim by appropriate documentary evidence and shall support the claim as 
to liability and measure of damages in the same manner as required of 
any other claimant. Documentary evidence of payment to a subrogor does 
not constitute evidence of liability of the United States or conclusive 
evidence of the amount of damages. The settlement authority makes an 
independent determination on the issues of fact and law based upon the 
evidence of record.
    (e) An insurance or other subrogated claim is not payable under 
Subpart E, F, or G of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 25.111  Action by claimant.

    (a) Form of claim. The claim must meet the requirements of 
Sec. 25.113. Authorized forms are available from the offices indicated 
in Sec. 25.103.
    (b) Presentation. Whenever possible the claim must be presented to 
the geographically appropriate Coast Guard Maintenance and Logistics 
Command. The Coast Guard Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic (lc) 
is located at 300 East Main Street, Suite 965, Norfolk, VA 23510-9113; 
Coast Guard Maintenance and Logistics Command Pacific (lc) is located at 
Coast Guard Island, Alameda, California, 94501. If that is not possible, 
the claim may also be presented to:
    (1) The commanding officer of the Coast Guard unit involved;
    (2) A Coast Guard unit convenient to the claimant; or
    (3) Chief, Office of Claims and Litigation, Chief Counsel, United 
States Coast Guard, 2100 Second Street, SW., Washington, DC, 20593.

In a foreign country, where there is no Coast Guard unit, the claim is 
considered presented to the Coast Guard if it is presented to the 
military attache of any United States embassy or consulate or to the 
commanding officer of any unit of the armed services of the United 
States.
    (c) Time. The time limits for presenting claims are contained in the 
following subparts addressing particular claim statutes.

[CGD 80-033, 46 FR 27109, May 18, 1981, as amended by CGD 87-008b, 52 FR

<R05>
Sec. 25.113  Contents of claim.

    (a) A claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act must be presented 
using Standard Form 95, Claim for Damage, Injury, or Death.

95. Any claim which is not presented using Standard Form 95 shall 
include:
    (1) The identity of the department, agency, or activity whose act or 
omission gave rise to the claim;
    (2) The full name and mailing address of the claimant. If this 
mailing address is not claimant's residence, the claimant shall also

    (c) A claimant or duly authorized agent or legal representative must 
sign in ink a claim and any amendment to that claim. If the person's 
signature does not include the first name, middle initial, if any, and 
surname, that information must be included in the claim. A married woman 
must sign her claim in her given name, e.g., ``Mary A. Doe,'' rather 
than ``Mrs. John Doe.''


<R05>
Sec. 25.115  Evidence supporting a claim.

    The claimant shall present independent evidence to support a claim.

authority determines the need for this examination, makes mutually 
convenient arrangements for such an examination, and bears the costs 
thereof.
    (c) All hospital records or other medical documents from either this 
injury or any relevant past injury.
    (d) If the claimant is employed, a written statement by the 
claimant's employer certifying the claimant's:

    (4) Hourly rate of pay or weekly salary,
    (5) Time lost from work as a result of the incident, and
    (6) Claimant's actual period of employment, full-time or part-time, 
and any effect of the injury upon such employment to support claims for 
lost earnings.
    (e) If the claimant is self-employed, written statements, or other

    (1) The amount of earnings actually lost, and
    (2) The Federal tax return if filed for the three previous years.

bill of sale and a written appraisal, or two written appraisals, from 
separate disinterested dealers or brokers, market quotations, commercial 
catalogs, or other evidence of the price at which like property can be 
obtained in the community. The settlement authority may waive these 
requirements when circumstances warrant. The cost of any appraisal may 
be included as an element of damage if

[[Page 96]]

not deductible from any bill submitted to claimant.
    (b) For each particular damaged item which can be economically 
repaired, evidence of cost of repairs such as a receipted bill and one 
estimate, or two estimates, from separate disinterested repairmen. The 
settlement authority may waive these requirements when circumstances 
warrant. The cost of any estimate may be included as an element of 
damage if not deductible from any repair bill submitted to claimant.
    (c) For any claim which may result in payment in excess of 
$20,000.00, a survey or appraisal shall be performed as soon as 
practicable after the damage accrues, and, unless waived in writing, 
shall be performed jointly with a government representative.
    (d) If the item is so severely damaged that it cannot be 
economically repaired or used, it shall be treated as a lost item.
    (e) If a claim includes loss of earnings or use during repairs to 
the damaged property, the following must also be furnished and supported 
by competent evidence:
    (1) The date the property was damaged;

    (6) Whether or not a substitute for the damaged property was 
available. If a substitute was used by the claimant during the time of 
repair, an explanation of the necessity of using the substitute, how it 
was used, and for how long, and the costs involved. Any costs incurred 
that would have been similarly incurred by the claimant in using the 
damaged property must be identified;
    (7) Whether or not during the course of undergoing repairs the 
property would have been used, and an explanation submitted showing the 
identity of the person who offered that use, the terms of the offer, 
time of prospective service, and rate of compensation; and
    (8) If at the time of damage the property was under charter or hire, 
or was otherwise employed, or would have been employed, the claimant 
shall submit a statement of operating expenses that were, or would have 
been, incurred. This statement shall include wages and all bonuses which 
would have been paid, the value of fuel and the value of consumable

<R05>
Sec. 25.121  Effect of other payments to claimant.

    The total amount to which the claimant may be entitled is normally 
computed as follows:
    (a) The total amount of the loss, damage, or personal injury 
suffered for which the United States is liable, less any payment the 
claimant has received from the following sources:
    (1) The military member or civilian employee who caused the 
incident;
    (2) The military member's or civilian employee's insurer; and
    (3) Any joint tort-feasor or insurer.
    (b) No deduction is generally made for any payment the claimant has 
received by way of voluntary contributions, such as donations of 
charitable organizations.


<R05>
Sec. 25.123  Settlement and notice to claimant.

    (a) If the settlement authority determines that the full amount 
claimed should be paid, the settlement authority forwards the claim to 
the disbursing officer for payment. If the time involved in settling the 
claim has been extensive, the settlement authority notifies the 
claimant.

[[Page 97]]

    (b) If the settlement authority determines that less than the full 
amount claimed should be paid, the settlement authority:
    (1) Notifies the claimant in writing of the proposed settlement.
    (2) Obtains from the claimant written acceptance and release for 
payment of the claim in the reduced amount.
    (3) Advises the claimant, in the event claimant does not desire to 
accept the offer, to reply within 45 days giving reasons for rejection.
    (4) Except upon a showing of good cause for delay in accepting a 
proposed settlement within 45 days, treats the non-acceptance as a 
rejection. Rejection by a claimant of an offer of settlement renders the 
offer void.
    (5) If a claimant rejects a proposed settlement or fails to reply 
within 45 days, the settlement authority may make further efforts to 
settle the claim. When the settlement authority determines that further 
efforts to settle the claim are not warranted, the settlement authority 
notifies the claimant in writing by registered or certified mail, return 
receipt requested, that the claim has been denied because the amount 
claimed is excessive.
    (c) If the claim is denied, the settlement authority notifies the 
claimant in writing by registered or certified mail, return receipt 
requested.


<R05>
Sec. 25.125  Appeal.

    The final denial of a claim by a settlement authority or a partial 
approval by a settlement authority is not subject to appeal except under 
the procedures prescribed for Military Claims in Subpart D of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 25.127  Reconsideration.

    (a) The settlement authority may reconsider a claim upon the 
authority's own initiative or upon request of the claimant or someone 
acting on the claimant's behalf.
    (b) A request for reconsideration must be in writing and include the 
legal or factual grounds for the relief requested.
    (c) Following any investigation or other action deemed necessary for 
reconsideration of the original action, the settlement authority 
reconsiders the claim and if warranted attempts to settle it. When 
further settlement efforts appear unwarranted, the settlement authority 
notifies the claimant in writing by certified or registered mail, return 
receipt requested, that the relief requested is denied.
    (d) For the effect of reconsideration under the Federal Tort Claims 
Act see 28 CFR Part 14.


<R05>
Sec. 25.129  Acceptance of offer of settlement.

    Claimant's acceptance of an offer of settlement is a complete 
release of any claim against the United States and against the military 
or civilian personnel of the Coast Guard whose act or omission gave rise 
to the claim.


<R05>
Sec. 25.131  Delegation of authority.

    (a) The Chief Counsel is delegated the following authority:

restore it or cause it to be restored to effective operating condition 
at the earliest practicable time. The failure of a vessel's 
radiotelephone equipment shall not, in itself, constitute a violation of 
this Act, nor shall it obligate the master of any vessel to moor or 
anchor his vessel; however, the loss of radiotelephone capability shall 
be given consideration in the navigation of the vessel.

Sec. 45.1  Enlistment of personnel.

    (a) The Coast Guard is a military service which operates within the 
Department of Homeland Security. All personnel enlisted in the Coast 
Guard are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
    (b) Any person desiring to enlist in the Coast Guard should apply at 
a Coast Guard Recruiting Office, or direct inquiries to, Coast Guard 
Recruiting Center, 4200 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 450, Arlington, VA 
22203. Enlistments in the Coast Guard shall be for general service and 
enlisted persons may be transferred as necessary from one unit to 
another. Original enlistments will be made only at regular recruiting 
offices unless otherwise directed by the Commandant. An original 
enlistment is the enlistment of an individual who has not had previous 
service in the Regular Coast Guard. In processing an application for 
enlistment, the Coast Guard will determine the mental, moral and 
physical fitness of the applicant through reference to local police 
files, character references, employers, school authorities and physical 
and mental examinations. Concealment of any fact, circumstance or 
condition existing prior to enlistment which would render the applicant 
ineligible for enlistment may subject the applicant to criminal 
penalties under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and/or 
administrative separation from the Coast Guard.

accordance with Sec. 49.01-10, that the alleged incompetent is mentally 
incapable of managing his own affairs, the Commandant may appoint a 
suitable person or persons, not under legal disability so to

[[Page 117]]

act, as trustee or trustees to receive in behalf of the incompetent all 
amounts due the incompetent from such sources set forth in Sec. 49.01-1, 
and to use said funds in the best interests of the incompetent.


<R05>
Sec. 49.05-5  Bonding of trustee.

    The trustee or trustees appointed to receive moneys in behalf of 
incompetent personnel shall furnish a bond in all cases when the amounts 
to be received may be expected to exceed $1,000, and in such other cases 
when deemed appropriate by the Commandant. The bond so required and 
furnished shall have as surety a company approved by the Federal 
Government, and shall be in such amount as is required by the 
Commandant. Such bonds shall be continued in effect for the life of 
trusteeship and expenses in connection with the furnishing and renewal 
of such bonds may be paid out of sums due the incompetent.


<R05>
Sec. 49.05-10  Affidavits required.

    The trustee or trustees appointed to receive moneys due incompetent 
personnel shall, prior to the payment of any such moneys, execute and 
file with the Commandant an affidavit or affidavits saying and deposing 
that any moneys henceforth received by virtue of such appointment shall 
be applied solely to the use and benefit of the incompetent and that no 
fee, commission, or charge shall be demanded, or in any manner accepted, 
for any service or services rendered in connection with such appointment 
as trustee or trustees.


<R04>
                    Subpart 49.10--Reports and Moneys


<R05>
Sec. 49.10-1  Reports required.

    The trustee or trustees so appointed shall submit reports annually, 
or at such other times as the Commandant may designate. The report shall 
show a statement of the conditions of the trust account at the time of 
the submission of the report, including all funds received on behalf of 
the incompetent; all expenditures made in behalf of the incompetent, 
accompanied by receipts or vouchers covering such expenditures; and a 
receipt indicating that the surety bond required by Sec. 49.05-5 has 
been renewed. When the trustee is the spouse or adult dependent of the 
incompetent, receipts or vouchers need not be filed for expenditures 
made for living expenses. If the trustee or trustees fail to report 
promptly and properly at the end of any annual period or at such other 
times as the Commandant desires, the Commandant may, in his discretion, 
cause payment to such trustee or trustees to cease, and may, if deemed 
advisable, appoint another person or persons not under legal disability 
so to act, to receive future payments of moneys due the incompetent for 
the use and benefit of the incompetent.


<R05>
Sec. 49.10-5  Payment of moneys due.

    Upon the appointment of a trustee or trustees to receive moneys due 
an incompetent, the authorized certifying officer having custody of that 
person's pay record shall be advised. After such notification, payments 
of moneys due the incompetent may be made by the appropriate officer in 
accordance with procedure prescribed by the Commandant. All such 
payments so made, however, shall be made to the designated trustee or 
trustees.


<R05>
Sec. 49.10-10  Cessation of payments.

    (a) Payments of amounts due incompetent personnel shall cease to be 
paid to the trustee or trustees upon receipt of notification by the 
authorized certifying officer of the occurrence of any of the following:
    (1) Death of the incompetent;
    (2) Death or disability of the trustee or trustees appointed;
    (3) Receipt of notice that a committee, guardian, or other legal 
representative has been appointed for the incompetent by a court of 
competent jurisdiction;
    (4) Failure of the trustee or trustees to render the reports 
required by Sec. 49.10-1;
    (5) That there is probable cause to believe that moneys received on 
behalf of the incompetent have been, or are being, improperly used;
    (6) A finding by a board of medical officers that the heretofore 
incompetent is mentally capable of managing his own affairs;

[[Page 118]]

    (7) That the Commandant deems it to be in the best interest of the 
incompetent.
    (b) In the event of termination of payments under paragraphs (a)(2), 
(4), (5), or (7) of this section, the Commandant may, if deemed 
appropriate, appoint a successor trustee or trustees. The successor 
trustee or trustees, so appointed, shall comply with the provisions of 
the regulations and instructions in this part issued thereunder, and do 
all acts in the manner required of the original trustee or trustees.


<R05>

of death or disability of the trustee, the final accounting will be 
filed by his legal representative.

<R05>
Sec. 51.1  Basis and purpose.

    This part establishes the procedures for review of administrative 
discharges from the Coast Guard by a Discharge Review Board (DRB) or by 
the Secretary of the Department, and for the compilation of the record 
of the DRB determination, made available for public inspection, copying 
and distribution through the Armed Forces Discharge Review/Correction 
Board Reading Room.


<R05>
Sec. 51.2  Authority.

    (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to 
establish a Discharge Review Board (DRB) to review the discharge of a 
former member of the United States Coast Guard under the provisions of 
10 U.S.C. 1553. This part prescribes the establishment and outlines the 
procedures of the Coast Guard Discharge Review Board. The Secretary

written opinion be forwarded to the Secretary for consideration;
    (2) Those cases selected by the Commandant to inform the Secretary

<R05>
Sec. 51.3  Applicability and scope.

    The provisions of this part apply to the United States Coast Guard 
including reserve-components and all former members who have been 
discharged within 15 years of the date upon which application for review 
is received by the DRB. A former member may apply to the DRB for a 
change in the character of, and/or the reason for, the discharge. The 
Coast Guard DRB review is generally applicable only to administrative 
discharges, however, the DRB may review the discharge of a former member 
by sentence of a court-martial for the purpose of clemency. A petition 
for clemency will not be considered by the DRB unless the applicant has 
exhausted all appellate remedies. Upon a petition for clemency, the DRB 
shall consider only the equity of the discharge awarded.


<R05>
Sec. 51.4  Definitions.

    Applicant. A former member of the Coast Guard who has been 
discharged from the service but excluding those discharged by sentence 
of a court-martial, except as provided in Sec. 51.3. If the former 
member is deceased or incompetent, the term ``applicant'' includes the 
surviving spouse, next-of-kin, or legal representative who is acting on 
behalf of the former member.
    Counsel. An individual or agency designated by the applicant who 
agrees to represent the applicant in a case before the DRB. It includes, 
but is not limited to: A lawyer who is a member of the bar of a federal 
court or of the highest court of a state; an accredited representative 
designated by an organization recognized by the Administrator of 
Veterans Affairs; a representative from a state agency concerned with 
veterans affairs; or a representative from private organizations or 
local government agencies.
    Discharge. Any formal separation of a member from the Coast Guard 
which is not termed ``honorable'', including dismissals and ``dropping 
from the rolls''. This term also includes the assignment of a separation 
program designator, separation authority, the stated reason for the 
discharge, and the characterization of service.
    Discharge Review. The process by which the reason for separation, 
the procedures followed in accomplishing separation, and the 
characterization of service are evaluated. This includes determinations 
made under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3103(e)(2).
    Discharge Review Board. A board consisting of five members of the 
U.S. Coast Guard, appointed by the Commandant of the Coast Guard and 
vested with the authority to review the discharge of a former member. 
The board is empowered to change a discharge or issue a new discharge to 
reflect its findings, subject to review by the Commandant or the 
Secretary.
    Hearing. A proceeding which, upon request of the applicant, is 
utilized in the discharge review process enabling the applicant and/or 
the applicant's representative to appear before the DRB and present 
evidence.
    President. An officer of the United States Coast Guard appointed by 
the Commandant as President to preside over the DRB. The President will 
convene the board and may also serve as a member. If the President does 
not serve as a member of the DRB, the President shall designate a 
presiding officer for the board to serve as President.

[CGD 81-104, 50 FR 41495, Oct. 11, 1985, as amended by CGD 96-026, 61 FR 
33663, June 28, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 51.5  Objective of review.

    The objective of the discharge review is to examine the propriety 
and equity of the applicant's discharge and to effect changes if 
necessary. The DRB will utilize its discretion to reach a fair and just 
resolution of the applicant's claim. The standards of review and the 
underlying factors which aid in determining whether the standards are 
met shall be historically consistent with criteria for determining 
honorable service. No factors shall be established which require 
automatic change, or denial of change, in a discharge.

[[Page 122]]


<R05>
Sec. 51.6  Propriety standard of review.

    A discharge is deemed to be proper except that:
    (a) A discharge may be improper if an error of fact, law, procedure, 
or discretion was associated with the discharge at the time of issuance 
which prejudiced the rights of the applicant.
    (b) A discharge may be improper if there has been a change in policy 
by the Coast Guard made expressly retroactive to the type of discharge 
under consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 51.7  Equity standard of review.

    (a) A discharge is presumed to be equitable and will not be changed 
under this section unless the applicant submits evidence sufficient to 
establish, to the satisfaction of the DRB that:
    (1) The policies and procedures under which the applicant was 
discharged differ in material respects from policies and procedures 
currently applicable on a service-wide basis to discharges of that type, 
provided that current policies or procedures represent a substantial 
enhancement of the rights afforded a party in such proceedings, and 
there is substantial doubt that the applicant would have received the 
same discharge if relevant current policies and procedures had been 
available to the applicant at the time of the discharge proceedings 
under consideration; or
    (2) At the time of issuance, the discharge was inconsistent with 
standards of discipline in the Coast Guard; or
    (3) The applicant's military record and other evidence presented to 
the DRB, viewed in conjunction with the factors listed in Sec. 51.8 and 
the regulations under which the applicant was discharged, do not fairly 
justify the type of discharge received.
    (b) If the applicant was discharged with a characterized discharge 
before June 15, 1983, a change from the characterized discharge to an 
uncharacterized discharge will not be considered under the provisions of 
(a)(1) of this section unless specifically requested by the applicant. A 
determination that a discharge is inequitable according to the 
provisions of (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section shall entitle the 
applicant to a discharge of a type to which the applicant was entitled 
at the time the original discharge was issued.


<R05>
Sec. 51.8  Relevant considerations.

    In determining the equity and propriety of a former member's 
discharge, the DRB shall consider all relevant evidence presented by the 
applicant. The DRB review will include, but is not limited to, 
consideration of the following factors:
    (a) The quality of the applicant's service. In determining the 
quality of the applicant's service, the DRB may consider the applicant's 
dates and periods of service; rate or rank achieved; marks and 
evaluations received; awards, decorations and letters of commendation; 
acts of merit; combat service and wounds received; promotions and 
demotions; prior military service and type of discharge; records of 
unauthorized absence; records of non-judicial punishment; convictions by 
court-martial; records of conviction by civil authorities while a member 
of the Coast Guard; and any other relevant information respecting the 
applicant which is brought to the board's attention.
    (b) The applicant's capability to serve. In determining the 
applicant's capability to serve, the DRB considers such factors as the 
applicant's age and education; qualification for reenlistment; 
capability to adjust to military service; and family or personal 
problems.
    (c) Any evidence of arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory actions 
by individuals in authority over the applicant.
    (d) Any other information respecting the applicant considered by the 
DRB to be relevant and material to the review of the applicant's 
discharge.


<R05>
Sec. 51.9  Discharge review procedures.

    (a) Preliminary. Prior to a review, applicants or their 
representatives may obtain copies of military records by submitting a 
Standard Form 180, Request Pertaining to Military Records, to the 
National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), 9799 Page Boulevard, St. 
Louis, MO. 72132. The request to the NPRC should be submitted prior to 
submitting the application for review, so that relevant information from 
the

[[Page 123]]

record can be included with the application.
    (b) Initiation of review. Review may be initiated by an applicant or 
by the DRB. The applicant may apply for DRB review of discharge by 
submitting DD Form 293, Application for Review of Discharge or 
Separation from the Armed Forces of the United States, along with any 
other statements, affidavits or documentation desired by the applicant. 
The application must be received by the DRB within fifteen (15) years of 
the date of the discharge. The application form can be obtained, along 
with explanatory matter, from Commandant, (G-WPM), U.S. Coast Guard 
Headquarters, 2100 2nd Street SW., Washington, DC 20593, any regional VA 
office, or by writing to the Armed Forces Review/Correction Board 
Reading Room, Pentagon Concourse, Washington, DC 20310.
    (c) Notice. (1) The DRB will provide notification advising the 
former member of--
    (i) Receipt of the applicant's request;
    (ii) The right to appear before the board in person or by counsel; 
and
    (iii) The date of review.

If the former member is deceased, written notice of DRB review will be 
sent to the surviving spouse, next of kin or legal representative of the 
former member. If the review is initiated by the DRB, notification will 
be sent to the last known address of the former member.
    (2) Prior to the initiation of the decision process, the DRB will 
notify the former member of the date by which requests to examine the 
documents to be considered by the board must be received. This notice 
will also state the date by which a request for a hearing must be made 
and the deadline for filing responses to the board.
    (3) An applicant who requests a hearing will be notified of the time 
and place of the hearing. All expenses incurred by the applicant in DRB 
proceedings and hearings are the sole responsibility of the applicant 
and are not obligations of the U.S. Coast Guard or the Department of 
Transportation. If the applicant fails to appear, except as provided in 
Sec. 51.9(f), the DRB will review the discharge and reach a decision 
based upon the evidence of record.
    (d) Withdrawal of application. An applicant may withdraw an 
application without prejudice at any time before the scheduled review. 
An application which is withdrawn will not stay the running of the 15 
year statutory limitation imposed on the authority of the DRB to review 
the discharge.
    (e) The DRB will consider the records and other data submitted by 
the applicant. The DRB may consider other probative evidence provided 
that all materials relied on by the DRB, except classified documents, 
are made available to the applicant and applicant's representative prior 
to the hearing date (or review date if no hearing is requested). The DRB 
shall not consider a classified document in the review of a discharge 
unless a summary of, or extract from, the document (deleting all 
reference to sources of information and other matters, the disclosure of 
which would, in the opinion of the classifying authority, be detrimental 
to the security interests of the United States) is made available to the 
applicant.
    (f) Postponement of review or hearing. At any time before the date 
of scheduled review or hearing, an applicant may be granted a 
continuance, provided the applicant or the applicant's counsel makes a 
written request for additional time to the DRB which shows good cause to 
justify the postponement.
    (g) Hearing procedures. The following procedures apply to DRB 
hearings:
    (1) DRB hearings are not public. Presence at hearings is limited to 
persons authorized by the Commandant or expressly requested by the 
applicant, subject to reasonable limitations based upon available space.
    (2) The Federal Rules of Evidence are not applicable to DRB 
proceedings. The presiding officer rules on matters of procedure and 
ensures that reasonable bounds of relevancy and materiality are adhered 
to in the taking of evidence.
    (3) An applicant is permitted to make a sworn or unsworn statement. 
Witness testimony will only be taken under oath or affirmation. An 
applicant or witness who makes a statement may be questioned by the DRB.

[[Page 124]]

Sec. 52.12  Function.

    The function of the Board is to consider all applications properly 
before it, together with all pertinent military records and any 
submission received from the Coast Guard or other Government office 
under subpart E, to determine:
    (a) Whether an error has been made in the applicant's Coast Guard 
military record, whether the applicant has suffered an error or 
injustice as the result of an omission or commission in his or her 
record, or whether the applicant has suffered some manifest injustice in 
the treatment accorded him or her; and
    (b) Whether the Board finds it necessary to change a military record 
to correct an error or remove an injustice.


<R05>
Sec. 52.13  Jurisdiction.

    (a) The Board has jurisdiction to review and determine all matters 
properly brought before it, consistent with existing law and such 
directives as may be issued by the Secretary.
    (b) No application shall be considered by the Board until the 
applicant has exhausted all effective administrative remedies afforded 
under existing law or regulations, and such legal remedies as the Board 
may determine are practical, appropriate, and available to the 
applicant.


<R04>
          Subpart C--General Provisions Regarding Applications


<R05>
Sec. 52.21  General requirements.

    (a) An application for correction of a Coast Guard record shall be 
submitted on DD Form 149 (Application for Correction of Military or 
Naval Record) or an exact copy thereof, and shall be addressed to: 
Chair, Board for Correction of Military Records of the Coast Guard (C-
60), United States Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590. 
Forms and explanatory material may be obtained from the Chair of the 
Board.
    (b) The application shall be signed by the person alleging error or 
injustice in his or her military record, except that an application may 
be signed by a family member or legal representative with respect to the 
record of a deceased, incapacitated, or missing person. The family 
member or legal representative must submit proof of his or her proper 
interest with the application.
    (c) No application shall be docketed or processed until it is 
complete. An application for relief is complete when all of the 
following have been received by the Board:
    (1) A signed DD Form 149, providing all necessary responses, 
including a specific allegation of error or injustice, accompanied by 
substantial evidence or information in support of such allegation;
    (2) The military records of the applicant; and
    (3) Any applicable military and Department of Veterans Affairs 
medical records.
    (d) It is the applicant's responsibility to include his or her 
correct mailing address on the DD Form 149 and to inform the Chair in 
writing of any subsequent change of address until the Board or the 
Secretary takes final action on the application.
    (e) Briefs in support of applications must be assembled in a manner 
that permits easy reproduction and may not exceed twenty-five double-
spaced typewritten pages in a type size with no more than twelve 
characters per inch.

[[Page 127]]

This limitation does not apply to supporting documentary evidence. In 
complex cases, the Chair may waive this limitation.


<R05>
Sec. 52.22  Time limit for filing application.

    An application for correction of a record must be filed within three 
years after the applicant discovered or reasonably should have 
discovered the alleged error or injustice. If an application is 
untimely, the applicant shall set forth reasons in the application why 
it is in the interest of justice for the Board to consider the 
application. An untimely application shall be denied unless the Board 
finds that sufficient evidence has been presented to warrant a finding 
that it would be in the interest of justice to excuse the failure to 
file timely.


<R05>
Sec. 52.23  Counsel.

    (a) Applicants may be represented by counsel at their own expense. 
Applicants whose cases are processed under the Whistleblower Protection 
Act and who are granted a hearing by the Board may be entitled to 
representation by a Coast Guard law specialist. 10 U.S.C. 1034(f)(3)(A).
    (b) As used in this part, the term ``counsel'' includes attorneys 
who are members in good standing of any bar; accredited representatives 
of veterans' organizations recognized by the Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 5902; and other persons who, in the 
opinion of the Chair, are competent to represent the applicant for 
correction. Whenever the term ``applicant'' is used in these rules, 
except in Sec. 52.21(c), the term shall mean an applicant or his or her 
counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 52.24  Evidence and burden of proof.

    (a) It is the responsibility of the applicant to procure and submit 
with his or her application such evidence, including official records, 
as the applicant desires to present in support of his or her case. All 
such evidence should be submitted with the applicant's DD Form 149 in 
accordance with Sec. 52.21(c)(1). Evidence submitted by an applicant 
after an application has been filed and docketed shall be considered 
late and its acceptance is subject to the provisions in Sec. 52.26(a)(4) 
and (c).
    (b) The Board begins its consideration of each case presuming 
administrative regularity on the part of Coast Guard and other 
Government officials. The applicant has the burden of proving the 
existence of an error or injustice by the preponderance of the evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 52.25  Access to official records.

    The applicant shall have such access to official records or to any 
information pertaining to the applicant which is in the custody of the 
Coast Guard as is provided in 49 CFR parts 7 and 10.


<R05>
Sec. 52.26  Right to timely decision; effect of requests for extensions, 
changes in requests for relief, and late submissions of evidence.

    (a) Each applicant has a right to have final action taken on his or 
her application within 10 months after all the elements of a complete 
application, as defined in Sec. 52.21(c), have been received by the 
Board, unless the applicant:
    (1) Submits a written request, which is granted by the Chair, for an 
extension of a specific duration to seek counsel or additional evidence;
    (2) Submits a written request, which is granted by the Chair, for an 
extension of the time provided for responding to the views of the Coast 
Guard in accordance with Sec. 52.42(d);
    (3) Submits a signed statement that is determined by the Chair to 
significantly amend the applicant's request for relief after the 
application has been docketed;
    (4) Submits significant new evidence, as determined by the Chair, 
after the application has been docketed; or
    (5) Is found by the Chair to have unreasonably delayed responding to 
a request for further information or evidence.
    (b) If the applicant requests an extension in accordance with 
paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section or unreasonably delays 
responding to a request for further information or evidence in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section, he or she shall have a 
right to have final action taken on the application for correction 
within 10 months of the application's completion

[[Page 128]]

plus all periods of extension granted to the applicant by the Chair and 
all periods of unreasonable delay.
    (c) If the applicant significantly amends his or her request for 
relief or submits significant new evidence after the application has 
been docketed, in accordance with paragraphs (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this 
section, the application shall be considered newly complete as of the 
date the amended request for relief or new evidence is received, in 
which case the applicant shall have a right to have final action taken 
on the application within 10 months of the date the Board receives the 
amended request for relief or significant new evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 52.27  Withdrawal of application.

    The Chair may, at his or her discretion, permit the applicant to 
withdraw his or her application at any time before final action is taken 
under Sec. 52.64. Any further consideration by the Board of the issues 
raised in the withdrawn application shall occur only upon the filing of 
a new application.


<R05>
Sec. 52.28  Stay of proceedings.

    An application to the Board for correction of a military record does 
not operate as a stay of any proceeding or administrative action taken 
with respect to or affecting the applicant.


<R04>
   Subpart D--Consideration of Application and Administrative Closure


<R05>
Sec. 52.31  Consideration of application.

    Each application shall be reviewed by the Chair to determine whether 
it meets the requirements of Sec. 52.21 before it is docketed. The Chair 
shall decide in appropriate cases whether to grant a hearing or to 
recommend disposition on the merits without a hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 52.32  Administrative closure.

    (a) The Chair may administratively close a case after it has been 
docketed and at any time prior to its consideration by the Board if the 
Chair determines that:
    (1) The application was erroneously docketed because the application 
did not meet the criteria under Sec. 52.21;
    (2) Effective relief cannot be granted by the Board;
    (3) The Board does not have jurisdiction to determine the issues 
presented or the applicant has not exhausted an available administrative 
remedy, as required under Sec. 52.13(b); or
    (4) The Coast Guard has granted effective relief satisfactory to the 
applicant.
    (b) Administrative closure does not constitute a denial of relief. 
Applicants who believe their cases should not have been administratively 
closed by the Chair may resubmit their applications with a request for 
further consideration and a statement explaining why the applicant 
believes his or her case should be docketed and considered by the Board. 
A request for further consideration shall be regarded as a new 
application for the purposes of Secs. 52.21 and 52.26.
    (c) If the Chair administratively closes a case, the applicant shall 
be advised of the reason and of the right to resubmit his or her 
application.

Sec. 52.42  Views of the Coast Guard.

    (a) The Board shall transmit to the Commandant of the Coast Guard or 
his or her delegate a copy of each application for relief submitted and 
docketed under subpart C of this part, together with any briefs, 
memoranda, and documentary evidence submitted or obtained in the case.
    (b) The Commandant of the Coast Guard or his or her delegate may 
forward to the Board a written advisory opinion presenting the views of 
the Coast Guard on any case before the Board.
    (c) An advisory opinion furnished by the Coast Guard under this 
section shall not be binding upon the Board, but shall be considered by 
the Board, along with all other information and material submitted in 
the particular

[[Page 129]]

case, if it is received by the Board within 135 days of the date the 
application is complete. The Chair may, in his or her discretion, grant 
the Coast Guard an extension of the time provided for submitting the 
advisory opinion.
    (d) The Board shall promptly send a copy of each submission made by 
the Coast Guard under this section to the applicant involved, subject to 
the limitations in Secs. 52.42(c) and 52.43(c). Each applicant has 30 
days, from the date the Board sends the submission, to submit to the 
Board a written rebuttal or response to the Coast Guard's advisory 
opinion or a written request for an extension of the time to respond, 
subject to the provisions in Sec. 52.26.
    (e) Advisory opinions submitted by the Coast Guard and briefs 
submitted by applicants in response to the advisory opinions of the 
Coast Guard must be assembled in a manner that permits easy reproduction 
and may not exceed fifteen double-spaced typewritten pages in a type 
size with no more than twelve characters per inch. This limitation does 
not apply to supporting documentary evidence. In complex cases, the 
Chair may waive this limitation.


<R05>
Sec. 52.43  Requests for further information; submissions of classified, 
privileged, and sensitive information.

    (a) The Chair or the Board may ask the applicant to submit 
additional information not included in the application or response to

Government office to submit any information, including reports of 
investigations, that the Chair or the Board deems relevant to an 
applicant's case.
    (c) Whenever the Coast Guard or other Government office submits 
classified, privileged, or sensitive information to the Board in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section or Sec. 52.42(b), it shall 
identify such information and also provide the Board with a copy of that 
part of the information that would be released to the applicant by the 
Coast Guard or other Government office if he or she requested it under 
49 CFR parts 7 and 10. The Board shall forward only this redacted copy 
to the applicant.

<R05>
Sec. 52.55  Nonappearance.

    (b) When the Board finds that the facts have not been fully and 
fairly disclosed by the records, testimony, and any other evidence 
before the Board, the Board may request the applicant and/or the Coast 
Guard to obtain and submit such further evidence as it considers 
essential to a complete and impartial understanding of the facts and 
issues.
    (c) Following the receipt of all evidence, the Chair shall cause to 
be prepared and shall submit to the Board for its consideration a draft 
decision containing proposed findings and conclusions and a proposed 
order. A majority vote of the members of the Board present at a meeting 
on any matter relating to a draft decision before the Board shall 
constitute the action of the Board. If a draft decision is approved by 
the Board, it shall become a decision of the Board.
    (d) The decision of the Board shall specify any change, correction, 
or modification of records to be made by the Coast Guard, and any other 
action deemed necessary to provide full and effective relief, which may 
include directing the Coast Guard to convene medical boards.

minority reports, if any; and all other materials necessary to reflect a 
true and complete history of the proceedings.
    (b) After final action has been taken on an application in 
accordance with Sec. 52.64, any classified, privileged, or sensitive 
information in the record of proceedings that has been provided by the 
Coast Guard or another Government office in accordance with Secs. 52.42

    (v) An application to receive a medal or award.
    (3) The Board may approve any application for correction of military

this section, if the Coast Guard recommends the same or substantially 
same relief as that requested by the applicant.
    (b) Except in cases where the Board takes final action under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the Board shall forward the record of its 
proceedings to the Secretary, who may approve, disapprove, or concur in 
the decision of the Board or the minority report, if any, either in 
whole or in part, and amend the order of the Board accordingly, or 
return the case to the Board for additional consideration. After taking 
final action, the Secretary shall send any such statement and the record 
of proceedings to the Board for disposition.


<R05>
Sec. 52.65  Orders.

    (a) The Board shall issue such orders or directives as may be

<R05>
Sec. 52.67  Reconsideration.

    (a) Reconsideration of an application for correction of a military 
record shall occur if an applicant requests it and the request meets the 
requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section.
    (1) An applicant presents evidence or information that was not 
previously considered by the Board and that could result in a 
determination other than that originally made. Such new evidence or 
information may only be considered if it could not have been presented 
to the Board prior to its original determination if the applicant had 
exercised reasonable diligence; or
    (2) An applicant presents evidence or information that the Board, or 
the Secretary as the case may be, committed legal or factual error in 
the original determination that could have resulted in a determination 
other than that originally made.
    (b) The Chair shall docket a request for reconsideration of a final

this section. If neither of these requirements is met, the Chair shall 
not docket such request.
    (c) The Board shall consider each application for reconsideration 
that has been docketed. None of the Board members who served on the 
Board that considered an applicant's original application for correction 
shall serve on the Board that decides the applicant's application upon 
reconsideration.
    (d) Action by the Board on a docketed application for 
reconsideration is subject to Secs. 52.26 and 52.64(b).
    (e) An applicant's request for reconsideration must be filed within 
two years after the issuance of a final decision, except as otherwise 
required by law. If the Chair dockets an applicant's request for 
reconsideration, the two-year requirement may be waived if the Board 
finds that it would be in the interest of justice to consider the 
request despite its untimeliness.

<R05>
Sec. 52.72  Implementation of orders.

    (a) In each case the Board shall transmit a copy of its decision or

required by law or regulation.
    (d) At the time of payment, the claimant shall be advised as to the 
nature and amount of the various benefits represented by the total

constitutes a complete release by the claimant of any claim against the 
United States on account of the correction of record ordered by the 
Board.


<R05>
Sec. 52.73  Interpretation.

    If the intent or import of the final decision is not clear to the 
Coast Guard, if the Coast Guard believes that executing all or part of 
the order in the final decision is beyond the Coast Guard's authority, 
or if the Coast Guard believes that the order is incomplete because of 
an oversight, the final decision shall be returned to the Board for 
clarification or technical amendment.


<R05>
Sec. 52.74  Report of settlement.

    When payment is made pursuant to the order of the Board, the Board 
may request the Coast Guard to notify it of the name of any person to 
whom payment was made and of the amount of the payment.

prevent an unwarranted invasion of privacy of the applicant or other 
persons mentioned in the final decision of the Board, a redacted copy of 
each final decision shall be indexed by subject and made available for

report will not be submitted within that time, and state when the report 
will be submitted.

there is probable cause to believe that a personnel action was taken, 
withheld, or threatened in reprisal for the Coast Guard member making or 
preparing to make a lawful communication to a Member of Congress or an 
Inspector General;
    (2) The Chief Counsel of the Coast Guard determines that the case is 
unusually complex or otherwise requires the assistance of a law 
specialist to ensure proper presentation of the legal issues in the 
case; and
    (3) The Coast Guard member is not represented by outside counsel 
chosen by the member.
    (d) If the Board elects to hold an administrative hearing, the Board 
must ensure that the Coast Guard member may examine witnesses through 
deposition, serve interrogatories, and request the production of 
evidence, including

[[Page 135]]

evidence in the Inspector General investigatory record but not included 
in the report released to the member.
    (e) If the Board determines that a personnel action was taken in 
reprisal for a Coast Guard member making or preparing to make a lawful 
communication to a Member of Congress or an Inspector General, the Board 
may forward its recommendation to the Secretary for the institution of 
appropriate administrative or disciplinary action against the individual 
or individuals found to have taken reprisal, and direct any appropriate 
correction of the member's records.
    (f) The Board shall notify the Inspector General of the Board's 
decision concerning an application for the correction of military 
records of a Coast Guard member who alleged reprisal for making or 
preparing to make a lawful communication to a Member of Congress or an

                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 62.1  Purpose.

    (a) The Coast Guard administers the U.S. Aids to Navigation System. 
The system consists of Federal aids to navigation operated by the Coast 
Guard, aids to navigation operated by the other armed services, and 
private aids to navigation operated by other persons.
    (b)(1) This part describes the general characteristics of the U.S. 
Aids to Navigation System, and the details, policies and procedures 
employed by the Coast Guard in establishing, maintaining, operating, 
changing or discontinuing Federal aids to navigation. Regulations 
concerning the marking of wrecks, structures, and other obstructions are 
found in 33 CFR part 64. Regulations concerning private aids are found 
in 33 CFR part 66. Regulations concerning the marking of artificial 
islands and structures which are erected on or over the seabed and 
subsoil of the Outer Continental Shelf of the United States or its 
possessions are found in 33 CFR part 67. Regulations concerning the 
marking of bridges are found in 33 CFR part 118. Regulations concerning 
aids to navigation at deepwater ports are found in subchapter NN of this 
chapter.
    (2) The regulations found in 33 CFR subpart 66.10 expire on December 
31, 2003, at which time the provisions of this part will apply.
    (c) The Coast Guard maintains systems of marine aids to navigation 
consisting of visual, audible, and electronic signals which are designed 
to assist the prudent mariner in the process of navigation. The aids to 
navigation system is not intended to identify every shoal or obstruction 
to navigation which exists in the navigable waters of the United States, 
but rather provides for reasonable marking of marine features as 
resources permit. The primary objective of the aids to navigation system 
is to mark navigable channels and waterways, obstructions

[[Page 143]]

adjacent to these waterways, and obstructions in areas of general 
navigation which may not be anticipated. Other waters, even if 
navigable, are generally not marked.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD 88-018, 54 FR 
48608, Nov. 24, 1989; CGD 97-018, 63 FR 33573, June 19, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 62.3  Definition of terms.

    Certain terms as used in this subchapter are defined as follows:
    (a) Aid to Navigation. The term aid to navigation means any device 
external to a vessel or aircraft intended to assist a navigator to 
determine position or safe course, or to warn of dangers or obstructions 
to navigation.
    (b) Commerce. The term commerce, in addition to general, national 
and international trade and commerce of the United States, includes 
trade and travel by seasonal passenger craft (marine and air), yachts, 
houseboats, fishing boats, motor boats, and other craft, whether or not 
operated for hire or profit.
    (c) Commandant. The term Commandant means the Commandant of the 
Coast Guard.
    (d) District Commander. The term District Commander means the 
commander of a Coast Guard District. Coast Guard Districts are listed in 
Part 3 of this chapter.
    (e) Corps of Engineers. The term Corps of Engineers means the Corps 
of Engineers, Department of the Army.
    (f) Person. The term person imparts both singular or plural, as the 
case demands, and includes any Federal Agency, State, Territory, 
possession, or public subdivision thereof, the District of Columbia, and 
any corporation, company, association, club, or other instrumentality.
    (g) Navigable Waters of the United States. The term Navigable waters 
of the United States is defined in Sec. 2.05-25(a) of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 62.5  Marking of marine parades and regattas.

    (a) The Coast Guard may establish aids to navigation to mark marine 
parades and regattas which are regulated by the Coast Guard for the 
purpose of protecting life and property, or to assist in the observance 
and enforcement of special regulations. For marine parade and regatta 
regulations, see Part 100 of this chapter.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R04>
              Subpart B--The U.S. Aids to Navigation System


<R05>
Sec. 62.21  General.

    (a) The navigable waters of the United States and non-navigable 
State waters after December 31, 2003, are marked to assist navigation 
using the U.S. Aids to Navigation System, a system consistent with the 
International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) Maritime 
Buoyage System. The IALA Maritime Buoyage System is followed by most of 
the world's maritime nations and will improve maritime safety by 
encouraging conformity in buoyage systems worldwide. IALA buoyage is 
divided into two regions made up of Region A and Region B. All navigable 
waters of the United States follow IALA Region B, except U.S. 
possessions west of the International Date Line and south of 10 degrees 
north latitude, which follow IALA Region A. Lateral aids to navigation 
in Region A vary from those described throughout this Subpart. Non-
lateral aids to navigation are the same as those used in Region B. See 
Sec. 62.25. Appropriate nautical charts and publications should be 
consulted to determine whether the Region A or Region B marking schemes 
are in effect for a given area.
    (b) The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is designed for use with 
nautical charts. Nautical charts portray the physical features of the 
marine environment, including soundings and other submarine features, 
landmarks, and other aids necessary for the proper navigation of a 
vessel. This crucial information cannot be obtained from other sources, 
even ones such as topographic maps, aeronautical charts, or atlases. The 
exact meaning of an aid to navigation may not be clear to the mariner 
unless the appropriate chart is consulted, as the chart illustrates the 
relationship of the individual aid to navigation to channel limits, 
obstructions, hazards to navigation, and to the total aids to navigation 
system.
    (c) The navigator should maintain and consult suitable publications 
and

[[Page 144]]

instruments for navigation depending on the vessel's requirements. This 
shipboard equipment is separate from the aids to navigation system, but 
is often essential to its use. The following publications are available 
from the U.S. Government to assist the navigator:
    (1) The Light List, published by the Coast Guard and available 
through the Government Printing Office or authorized sales agents, lists 
federal and private aids to navigation. It includes all major Federal 
aids to navigation and those private aids to navigation, which have been 
deemed to be important to general navigation, and includes a physical 
description of these aids and their locations.
    (2) The United States Coast Pilot, published by the National Ocean 
Service and available through that agency or authorized nautical chart 
sales agents, supplements the information shown on nautical charts. 
Subjects such as local navigation regulations, channel and anchorage 
peculiarities, dangers, climatalogical data, routes, and port facilities 
are covered.
    (3) Local Notices to Mariners are published by local Coast Guard 
District Commanders. Persons may be placed on the mailing list to 
receive local Notices by contacting the Aids to Navigation and Waterway 
Management Branch of the appropriate Coast Guard District. These notices 
pass information affecting navigation safety. Changes to aids to 
navigation, reported dangers, scheduled construction or other 
disruptions, chart corrections and similar useful marine information is 
made available through this publication.
    (4) The Notice to Mariners is a national publication, similar to the 
Local Notice to Mariners, published by the National Imagery and Mapping 
Agency. The notice may be obtained free of charge from commercial 
maritime sources and, upon request, to Defense Logistics Agency, Defense 
Supply Center Richmond, ATTN: JNB, 8000 Jefferson Davis Highway, 
Richmond, VA 23297-5100 or FAX 804-279-6510, ATTN: Accounts Manager, 
RMF. A letter of justification should be included in the request. This 
publication provides ocean going vessels significant information on 
national and international navigation and safety.
    (5) The mariner should also listen to Coast Guard Broadcast Notices 
to Mariners. These broadcasts update the Local Notice to Mariners with 
more timely information. Mariners should monitor VHF-FM channel 16 to 
locate Coast Guard Marine Information Broadcasts.
    (d) The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is primarily a lateral system 
which employs a simple arrangement of colors, shapes, numbers, and light 
characteristics to mark the limits of navigable routes. This lateral 
system is supplemented by nonlateral aids to navigation where 
appropriate.
    (e) Generally, lateral aids to navigation indicate on which side of 
a vessel an aid to navigation should be passed when the vessel is 
proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. Normally, the 
Conventional Direction of Buoyage is the direction in which a vessel 
enters navigable channels from seaward and proceeds towards the head of 
navigation. In the absence of a route leading from seaward, the 
Conventional Direction of Buoyage generally follows a clockwise 
direction around land masses. For example, proceeding southerly along 
the Atlantic Coast, from Florida to Texas along the Gulf Coast, and 
northerly along the Pacific Coast are considered as proceeding in the 
Conventional Direction of Buoyage. In some instances, this direction 
must be arbitrarily assigned. Where doubt exists, the mariner should 
consult charts and other nautical publications.
    (f) Although aids to navigation are maintained to a reasonable 
degree of reliability, the rigors of the marine environment and various 
equipment failures do cause discrepancies on occasion.
    (g) The Coast Guard makes reasonable efforts to inform the navigator 
of known discrepancies, and to correct them within a reasonable period 
of time, depending upon resources available. Occasionally, a temporary 
aid to navigation, which provides different but similar service, is 
deployed until permanent repairs can be made to the original aid. 
Notification of such temporary changes is made through the notice to 
mariners system.

[[Page 145]]

    (h) Mariners should exercise caution when using private aids to 
navigation because private aids are often established to serve the needs 
of specific users rather than general navigation and their purpose may 
not be obvious to casual users; and, discrepancies to private aids are 
often detected, reported, and corrected less promptly than discrepancies 
to Coast Guard aids to navigation.

9286, 66 FR 33640, June 25, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 62.23  Beacons and buoys.

    (a) Aids to navigation are placed on shore or on marine sites to 
assist a navigator to determine his position or safe course. They may 
mark limits of navigable channels, or warn of dangers or obstructions to 
navigation. The primary components of the U.S. Aids to Navigation System 
are beacons and buoys.
    (b) Beacons are aids to navigation structures which are permanently 
fixed to the earth's surface. They range from large lighthouses to 
small, single-pile structures and may be located on land or in the 
water. Lighted beacons are called lights; unlighted beacons are called 
daybeacons.
    (1) Beacons exhibit a daymark. For small structures these are 
colored geometric shapes which make an aid to navigation readily visible 
and easily identifiable against background conditions. Generally, the 
daymark conveys to the mariner, during daylight hours, the same 
significance as does the aid's light or reflector at night. The daymark 
of large lighthouses and towers, however, consists of the structure 
itself. As a result, these daymarks do not infer lateral significance.
    (2) Vessels should not pass beacons close aboard due to the danger 
of collision with rip-rap or structure foundations, or the obstruction 
or danger that the aid marks.
    (c) Buoys are floating aids to navigation used extensively 
throughout U.S. waters. They are moored to the seabed by sinkers with 
chain or other moorings of various lengths.
    (1) The daymark of a buoy is the color and shape of the buoy and, if 
so equipped, of the topmark.
    (i) Can buoys have a cylindrical shape.
    (ii) Nun buoys have a tapered, conical shape.
    (iii) Pillar buoys have a wide cylindrical base supporting a 
narrower superstructure. They may be surmounted by colored shapes called 
topmarks.
    (iv) Spherical buoys have a round shape.
    (2) Mariners attempting to pass a buoy close aboard risk collision 
with a yawing buoy, the buoy's mooring, or with the obstruction which 
the buoy marks.
    (3) Mariners should not rely on buoys alone for determining their 
positions due to factors limiting their reliability. Prudent mariners 
will use bearings or angles from beacons or other landmarks, soundings, 
and various methods of electronic navigation. Buoys vary in reliability 
because:
    (i) Buoy positions represented on nautical charts are approximate 
positions only, due to practical limitations in positioning and 
maintaining buoys and their sinkers in precise geographical locations.
    (ii) Buoy moorings vary in length. The mooring lengths define a 
``watch circle'', and buoys can be expected to move within this circle. 
Actual watch circles do not coincide with the dots or circles 
representing them on charts.
    (iii) Buoy positions are normally verified during periodic 
maintenance visits. Between visits, environmental conditions, including 
atmospheric and sea conditions, and seabed slope and composition, may 
shift buoys off their charted positions. Also buoys may be dragged off 
station, sunk, or capsized by a collision with a vessel.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987; CGD 86-031, 52 FR 46351, Dec. 5, 
1987]


<R05>
Sec. 62.25  Lateral marks.

    (a) Lateral marks define the port and starboard sides of a route to 
be followed. They may be either beacons or buoys.
    (b) Sidemarks are lateral marks which advise the mariner to stay to

[[Page 146]]

one side of the mark. Their most frequent use is to mark the sides of 
channels; however, they may be used individually to mark obstructions 
outside of clearly defined channels. Sidemarks are not always placed 
directly on a channel edge and may be positioned outside the channel as 
indicated on charts and nautical publications.
    (1) Port hand marks indicate the left side of channels when 
proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. Beacons have green 
square daymarks, while buoys are green can or pillar buoys.
    (2) Starboard hand marks indicate the right side of channels when 
proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. Beacons have red 
triangular daymarks, while buoys are red nun or pillar buoys.
    (c) Preferred channel marks indicate channel junctions or 
bifurcations and may also mark wrecks or obstructions which the mariner, 
after consulting a chart to ascertain the location of the obstruction 
relative to the aid, may pass on either side. Preferred channel marks 
have red and green horizontal bands with the color of the topmost band 
indicating the preferred channel. If the topmost band is green, the mark 
serves as a port hand mark for vessels following the preferred channel 
proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage, and as a starboard 
hand mark for the other channel. Beacons would have square daymarks, 
while buoys would be can or pillar buoys. If the topmost band is red, 
the mark serves as a starboard hand mark for vessels following the 
preferred channel proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage, 
and a port hand mark for the other channel. Beacons would have 
triangular daymarks, while buoys would be nun or pillar buoys.
    (d) The above color schemes apply to IALA Region B. Marks located in 
the IALA Region A exhibit reversed color significance: port hand marks 
will be red when following the Conventional Direction of Buoyage, and 
starboard hand marks will be green. The meaning of daymark and buoy 
shapes is identical in both regions.
    (e) Certain marks on the Intracoastal Waterway may exhibit reversed 
lateral significance. See Sec. 62.49.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD 88-018, 54 FR 
48608, Nov. 24, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 62.27  Safe water marks.

    Safe water marks indicate that there is navigable water all around 
the mark. They are often used to indicate fairways or midchannels, or 
the seaward end of channels. Safe water marks are colored with red and 
white vertical stripes. Beacons have an octagonal daymark; red and white 
buoys are spherical or display a red spherical topmark.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD 88-018, 54 FR 
48608, Nov. 24, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 62.29  Isolated danger marks.

    Isolated danger marks indicate an isolated danger which may be 
passed on all sides. As these marks are erected or moored on or near 
dangers, they should not be approached closely without special caution. 
These marks are colored black with one or more broad horizontal red 
bands and are equipped with a topmark of two black spheres, one above 
the other.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD 88-018, 54 FR 
48608, Nov. 24, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 62.31  Special marks.

    Special marks are not primarily intended to assist safe navigation, 
but to indicate special areas or features referred to in charts or other 
nautical publications. They may be used, for example, to mark 
anchorages, cable or pipeline areas, traffic separation schemes, 
military exercise zones, ocean data acquisition systems, etc. Special 
marks are colored solid yellow.


<R05>
Sec. 62.32  Inland waters obstruction mark.

    (a) On inland waters designated by the Commandant as State waters in 
accordance with Sec. 66.05-5 of this chapter and on non-navigable 
internal waters of a State which have no defined head of navigation, a 
buoy showing alternate vertical black and white stripes

[[Page 147]]

may be used to indicate to a vessel operator that an obstruction to 
navigation extends from the nearest shore to the buoy.
    (b) The black and white buoy's meaning is ``do not pass between the 
buoy and the shore''. The number of white and black stripes is 
discretionary, provided that the white stripes are twice the width of 
the black stripes. Prior to December 31, 2003, this aid shall not be 
used on a waterway which has a red and white striped obstruction marker 
defined in Sec. 66.10-15(e)(3) of this chapter, unless all obstruction 
markers are replaced.

[CGD 97-018, 63 FR 33573, June 19, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 62.33  Information and regulatory marks.

    (a) Information and Regulatory Marks are used to alert the mariner 
to various warnings or regulatory matters. These marks have orange 
geometric shapes against a white background. The meanings associated 
with the orange shapes are as follows:
    (1) A vertical open-faced diamond signifies danger.
    (2) A vertical diamond shape having a cross centered within 
indicates that vessels are excluded from the marked area.
    (3) A circular shape indicates that certain operating restrictions 
are in effect within the marked area.
    (4) A square or rectangular shape will contain directions or 
instructions lettered within the shape.
    (b) When a buoy is used as an information or regulatory mark it 
shall be white with two horizontal orange bands placed completely around 
the buoy circumference. One band shall be near the top of the buoy body, 
with a second band placed just above the waterline of the buoy so that 
both bands are clearly visible.

<R05>
Sec. 62.35  Mooring buoys.

    Mooring Buoys are white with a blue horizontal band. This 
distinctive color scheme is recommended to facilitate identification and 
to avoid confusion with aids to navigation.


<R05>
Sec. 62.37  Lighthouses.

    Lighthouses are prominent beacons of varying size, color, and 
appearance employed to mark headlands, landfalls, harbor entrances, 
channel edges, hazards, and other features. While normally identified by 
their distinctive appearance, some lighthouses display diamond shaped, 
checkered daymarks to facilitate recognition.


<R05>
Sec. 62.39  Large navigational buoys.

    Large Navigational Buoys (LNB's) may be considered floating 
lighthouses. They generally provide light, sound, and radiobeacon 
signals, and some are equipped with radar beacons (racons). LNB's are 
red in color, have a forty foot diameter hull, and a tower approximately 
forty feet in height.


<R05>
Sec. 62.41  Ranges.

    Ranges are aids to navigation systems employing dual beacons which, 
when the structures appear to be in line, assist the mariner in 
maintaining a safe course. The appropriate nautical chart must be 
consulted when using ranges to determine whether the range marks the 
centerline of the navigable channel and also to ascertain what section 
of the range may be safety traversed. Ranges are generally, but not 
always, lighted, and display rectangular daymarks of various colors.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987; CGD 86-031, 52 FR 46351, Dec. 5, 
1987]


<R05>
Sec. 62.43  Numbers and letters.

    (a) All solid red and solid green aids are numbered, with red aids 
bearing even numbers and green aids bearing odd numbers. The numbers for 
each increase in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. Numbers are kept 
in approximately sequence on both sides of the channel by omitting 
numbers where necessary.
    (b) Only sidemarks are numbered. However, aids other than those 
mentioned above may be lettered to assist in their identification, or to 
indicate their purpose. Sidemarks may carry letters in addition to 
numbers to identify the first aid to navigation in a waterway, or when 
new aids to navigation are added to channels with previously

[[Page 148]]

completed numerical sequences. Letters on sidemarks will follow 
alphabetical order from seaward and proceeding toward the Conventional 
Direction of Buoyage and will be added to numbers as suffixes.
    (c) Aids to navigation may be fitted with light-reflecting material 
to increase their visibility in darkness. The colors of this material 
may convey the same significance as the aid except that letters and 
numbers may be white.
    (d) Exceptions to the provisions of this section will be found on 
the Western Rivers System. See Sec. 62.51.
    (e) The guidelines for the display of numbers and letters on aids to 
navigation are identical for both Region A and Region B; red aids to 
navigation display even numbers, and green aids display odd numbers.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD 88-018, 54 FR 
48608, Nov. 24, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 62.45  Light characteristics.

    (a) Lights on aids to navigation are differentiated by color and 
rhythm. Lighthouses and range lights may display distinctive light 
characteristics to facilitate recognition. No special significance 
should be attached to the color or rhythm of such lights. Other lighted 
aids to navigation employ light characteristics to convey additional 
information.
    (b) When proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage, aids 
to navigation, if lighted, display light characteristics as follows:
    (1) Green lights mark port (left) sides of channels and locations of 
wrecks or obstructions which are to be passed by keeping these lights on 
the port (left) hand of a vessel. Green lights are also used on 
Preferred Channel Marks where the topmost band is green.
    (2) Red lights mark starboard (right) sides of channels and 
locations of wrecks or obstructions which are to be passed by keeping 
these lights on the starboard (right) hand of a vessel. Red lights are 
also used on Preferred Channel Marks where the topmost band is red.
    (3) Certain lights marking the Intracoastal Waterway may display 
reversed lateral significance. See Sec. 62.49.
    (c) Yellow lights have no lateral significance. Except on the 
Western Rivers, see Sec. 62.51, white lights have no lateral 
significance. The purpose of aids exhibiting white or yellow lights may 
be determined by their shape, color, letters or numbers, and the light 
rhythm employed.
    (d) Light rhythms, except as noted in Sec. 62.51 for the Western 
Rivers, are employed as follows:
    (1) Aids with lateral significance display regularly flashing or 
regularly occulting light rhythms. Ordinarily, flashing lights 
(frequency not exceeding 30 flashes per minute) will be used.
    (2) Preferred Channel Marks display a composite group flashing light 
rhythm (groups of two flashes followed by one flash).
    (3) Safe Water Marks display a white Morse Code ``A'' rhythm (short-
long flash).
    (4) Isolated Danger Marks display a white group flashing two.
    (5) Special Marks display yellow lights with fixed or slow flashing 
rhythm preferred.
    (6) Mooring Buoys and Information and Regulatory Marks display white 
lights of various rhythms.
    (7) For situations where lights require a distinct cautionary 
significance, as at sharp turns, sudden channel constrictions, wrecks, 
or obstructions, a quick flashing light rhythm (60 flashes per minute) 
may be used.
    (e) Occasionally lights use sectors to mark shoals or warn mariners 
of other dangers. Lights so equipped show one color from most directions 
and a different color or colors over definite arcs of the horizon as 
indicated on the appropriate nautical chart. These sectors provide 
approximate bearing information since the observer should note a change 
of color as the boundary between the sectors is crossed. As sector 
bearings are not precise, they should be considered a warning only and 
not used to determine exact bearing to the light.
    (f) Aids to navigation may be fitted with light-reflecting material 
to increase their visibility in darkness. Green or red reflective 
material is used only on marks which, if lighted, would exhibit a light 
of that color. Yellow reflective material is used on special

[[Page 149]]

marks and on Intracoastal Waterway marks. No significance is attached to 
white reflective material.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD 88-018, 54 FR 
48608, Nov. 24, 1989; CGD 97-018, 63 FR 33573, June 19, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 62.47  Sound signals.

    (a) Often sound signals are located on or adjacent to aids to 
navigation. When visual signals are obscured, sound signals warn 
mariners of the proximity of danger.
    (1) Sound signals are distinguished by their tone and phase 
characteristics.
    (i) Tones are determined by the devices producing the sound (i.e., 
diaphones, diaphragm horns, reed horns, sirens, whistles, bells and 
gongs).
    (ii) Phase characteristics are defined by the signal's sound 
pattern, i.e., the number of blasts and silent periods per minute and 
their durations. Sound signals emanating from fixed structures generally 
produce a specific number of blasts and silent periods each minute when 
operating. Buoy sound signals are generally actuated by the motion of 
the sea and therefore do not emit a regular signal characteristic.
    (2) Where no live watch is maintained, sound signals are normally 
operated continuously. However, some are equipped with fog detectors 
which activate sound signals when visibility falls below a predetermined 
limit.
    (b) Mariners should not rely solely on sound signals to determine 
their positions for the following reasons:
    (1) Distance cannot be accurately determined by sound intensity.
    (2) Occasionally sound signals may not be heard in areas close to 
their location.
    (3) Signals may not sound in cases where fog exists close to, but 
not at, the location of the sound signal.
    (4) As buoy signals are generally activated by sea motion, they may 
produce no signals when seas are calm.
    (5) As previously noted, buoy positions are not always reliable. 
Therefore their sound signals cannot be assumed to be emanating from a 
fixed position.


<R05>
Sec. 62.49  Intracoastal Waterway identification.

    (a) In addition to the conventional signals, aids to navigation 
marking the Intracoastal Waterway exhibit unique yellow symbols to 
distinguish them from aids marking other waters.
    (1) Yellow triangles indicate that aids to navigation so marked 
should be passed keeping them on the starboard (right) hand of a vessel, 
regardless of the aid's number, color, or light color.
    (2) Yellow squares indicate that aids to navigation so marked should 
be passed keeping them on the port (left) hand of a vessel, regardless 
of the aid's number, color, or light color.
    (3) A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral information, but 
simply identifies aids to navigation as marking the Intracoastal 
Waterway.
    (b) The above guidelines apply for vessels traversing the 
Intracoastal Waterway in a southerly direction on the Atlantic Coast, in 
a westerly direction on the Okeechobee Waterway, or in a westerly 
direction along the Gulf Coast.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987; CGD 86-031, 52 FR 46351, Dec. 5, 
1987]


<R05>
Sec. 62.51  Western Rivers Marking System.

    (a) A variation of the standard U.S. aids to navigation system 
described above is employed on the Mississippi River and tributaries 
above Baton Rouge, LA and on certain other rivers which flow toward the 
Gulf of Mexico.
    (b) The Western Rivers System varies from the standard U.S. system 
as follows:
    (1) Buoys are not numbered.
    (2) Numbers on beacons do not have odd/even lateral significance 
but, rather, indicate mileage from a fixed point (normally the river 
mouth).
    (3) Diamond-shaped non-lateral dayboards, checkered red-and-white or 
green-and-white, similar to those used in the U.S. Aids to Navigation 
System, as appropriate, are used as crossing dayboards where the river 
channel crosses from one bank to the other.
    (4) Lights on green buoys and on beacons with green daymarks show a 
single flash which may be green or white.
    (5) Lights on red buoys and on beacons with red daymarks show a 
double

[[Page 150]]

flash [Group Flashing (2)] which may be red or white.
    (6) Isolated danger marks are not used.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD-94-091, 61 FR 
27782, June 3, 1996; USCG-2001-9286, 66 FR 33640, June 25, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 62.53  Racons.

    (a) Aids to navigation may be enhanced by the use of radar beacons 
(racons). Racons, when triggered by a radar signal, will transmit a 
coded reply to the interrogating radar. This reply serves to identify 
the aid station by exhibiting a series of dots and dashes which appear 
on the radar display in a line emanating radially from just beyond the 
echo of the aid station. Although racons may be used on both laterally 
significant and non-laterally significant aids alike, the racon signal 
itself is for identification purposes only, and therefore carries no 
lateral significance.
    (b) Racons are also used as bridge marks to mark the best point of 
passage.


<R05>
Sec. 62.54  Ownership identification.

    Ownership identification on private or state aids to navigation is 
permitted so long as it does not change or hinder an understanding of 
the meaning of the aid to navigation.

[CGD 97-018, 63 FR 33573, June 19, 1998]


<R04>
                    Subpart C--Maritime Radiobeacons


<R05>
Sec. 62.55  General.

    Maritime radiobeacons operate during specific intervals as published 
in Coast Guard Light Lists. For station identification, simple 
characteristics consisting of combinations of dots and dashes are used. 
The characteristics of marker-beacons are composed of series of dashes 
for part of a 15 second cycle, which is followed by a silent period to 
complete the cycle. The transmitted power of maritime radiobeacons is 
adjusted to provide a useable signal at the service range which meets 
the operational requirement. Marker-beacons are of low power for local 
use only. Coast Guard maritime radiobeacons operate within the frequency 
band 275-335 kilohertz.


<R05>
Sec. 62.57  Carrier type operation.

    Radiobeacons superimpose the characteristic code on a carrier 
frequency which is on continuously during the period of 
transmission.This extends the usefulness of maritime radiobeacons to 
aircraft and ships employing automatic direction finders.


<R05>
Sec. 62.59  Calibration service.

    Special calibration radiobeacons, as listed in the current editions 
of the Coast Guard Light Lists, will broadcast continuously for the 
purpose of enabling vessels to calibrate their direction finders upon 
request either to the cognizant District Commander, or, if time does not 
permit, directly to the calibration station. Signals for requesting 
calibration service are described in the current editions of the Coast 
Guard Light Lists. In the case of sequenced radiobeacon stations, 
continuous transmission for calibration purposes cannot be made without 
interference resulting with other stations in the same frequency group.


<R05>
Sec. 62.61  Caution.

    (a) A vessel steering a course for a radiobeacon should observe the 
same precautions that apply when steering for a light or any other mark.
    (b) Distance cannot be accurately determined by radiobeacon signal. 
Mariners must exercise extreme caution when the aid to navigation which 
supports the radiobeacon is not visible, and no other means of 
determining its distance is available.
    (c) If the radiobeacon is aboard a Large Navigational Buoy (LNB) or 
on any marine site, particular care should be exercised to avoid the 
possibility of collision. In addition, caution should be exercised in 
using radiobeacons aboard floating aids, because of the possibility that 
the aid could be off station.

[[Page 151]]


<R04>
    Subpart D--Public Participation in the Aids to Navigation System


<R05>
Sec. 62.63  Recommendations.

    (a) The public may recommend changes to existing aids to navigation, 
request new aids or the discontinuation of existing aids, and report 
aids no longer necessary for maritime safety. These recommendations 
should be sent to the appropriate District Commander.
    (b) Recommendations, requests and reports should be documented with 
as much information as possible to justify the proposed action. 
Desirable information includes:
    (1) Nature of the vessels which transit the area(s) in the question, 
including type, displacement, draft, and number of passengers and crew.
    (2) Where practicable, the kinds of navigating devices used aboard 
such vessels (e.g, magnetic or gyro compasses, radio direction finders, 
radar, loran, and searchlights).
    (3) A chartlet or sketch describing the actual or proposed location 
of the aid(s), and a description of the action requested or recommended.


<R05>
Sec. 62.65  Procedure for reporting defects and discrepancies.

    (a) Mariners should notify the nearest Coast Guard facility 
immediately of any observed aids to navigation defects or discrepancies.
    (b) The Coast Guard cannot monitor the many thousands of aids in the 
U.S. Aids to Navigation System simultaneously and continuously. As a 
result, it is not possible to maintain every aid operating properly and 
on its charted position at all times. Marine safety will be enhanced if 
persons finding aids missing, sunk, capsized, damaged, off station, or 
showing characteristics other than those advertised in the Light List, 
or other publication, promptly inform the Coast Guard. When making the 
report to the Coast Guard the mariner should consult the Light List to 
ensure the correct geographical information is used due to the 
similarity of names and geographical areas.
    (c) Procedures for reporting defects and discrepancies:
    (1) Radio messages should be prefixed ``Coast Guard'' and 
transmitted directly to a Government shore radio station listed in 
Chapter three of Radio Navigation Aids Publication, 117, for relay to 
the relevant District Commander.
    (2) Commercial communications facilities should be used only when 
vessels are unable to contact a Government shore radio station. Charges 
for these messages will be accepted ``collect'' by the Coast Guard.

Sec. 64.11  Marking and notification requirements.

    (a) The owner of a vessel, raft, or other craft wrecked and sunk in 
a navigable channel shall mark it immediately with a buoy or daymark 
during the day and with a light at night. The owner of a sunken vessel, 
raft, or other obstruction that otherwise constitutes a hazard to 
navigation shall mark it in accordance with this subchapter.
    (b) Owners of vessels sunk in waters subject to the jurisdiction of 
the United States or sunk on the high seas, if the owner is subject to 
the jurisdiction of the United States, shall promptly report to the 
District Commander, in whose jurisdiction the obstruction is located, 
the action they are taking to mark the sunken vessel, giving the 
following information (in addition to the information required by 46 CFR 
4.05, Notice of Marine Casualty and Voyage Records):
    (1) Name and description of the sunken vessel;
    (2) Accurate description of the location of the vessel;

    In determining whether an obstruction is a hazard to navigation for 
the purposes of marking, the District Commander considers, but is not 
limited to, the following factors:
    (a) Location of the obstruction in relation to the navigable channel 
and other navigational traffic patterns;
    (b) Navigational difficulty in the vicinity of the obstruction;
    (c) Depth of water over the obstruction, fluctuation of the water 
level, and other hydrologic characteristics in the area;
    (d) Draft, type, and density of vessel traffic or other marine 
activity in the vicinity of the obstruction;
    (e) Physical characteristics of the obstruction;
    (f) Possible movement of the obstruction;
    (g) Location of the obstruction in relation to other obstructions or 
aids to navigation;
    (h) Prevailing and historical weather conditions;
    (i) Length of time that the obstruction has been in existence;
    (j) History of vessel incidents involving the obstruction; and
    (k) Whether the obstruction is defined as a hazard to navigation 
under other statutes or regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 64.33  Marking by the Coast Guard.

    (a) The District Commander may mark for the protection of maritime 
navigation any structure, sunken vessel or other obstruction that is not

[[Page 154]]

suitably marked by the owner. Markings established by the Coast Guard do 
not relieve the owner's duty or responsibility to mark the sunken vessel 
or other obstruction, or to remove it as required by law.
    (b) Costs for markings established by the Coast Guard will be 
determined in accordance with part 74 of this Chapter.
    (c) Costs for marking of a sunken vessel or other obstruction shall 
be charged to the owner and shall continue until:
    (1) The vessel or other obstruction is removed;
    (2) The right of the owner to abandon is legally established and has 
been exercised; or
    (3) The District Commander directs otherwise.

<R05>
Sec. 66.10-15  Aids to navigation.

    (a) USWMS aids to navigation may have lateral or cardinal meaning.
    (b) On a well defined channel including a river or other relatively 
narrow natural or improved waterway, an aid to navigation shall normally 
be a solid colored buoy. A buoy which marks the left side of the channel 
viewed looking upstream or toward the head of navigation shall be 
colored all black. A buoy which marks the right side of the channel 
viewed looking upstream or toward the head of a navigation shall be 
colored all red. On a well defined channel, solid colored buoys shall be 
established in pairs, one on each side of the navigable channel which 
they mark, and opposite each other to inform the user that the channel 
lies between the buoys and that he should pass between the buoys.
    (c) On an irregularly defined channel, solid colored buoys may be 
used singly in staggered fashion on alternate sides of the channel 
provided they are spaced at sufficiently close intervals to inform the 
user that the channel lies between the buoys and that he should pass 
between the buoys.
    (d) Where there is no well-defined channel or when a body of water 
is obstructed by objects whose nature or location is such that the 
obstruction can be approached by a vessel from more than one direction, 
supplemental aids to navigation having cardinal meaning (i.e., 
pertaining to the cardinal points of the compass, north, east, south, 
and west) may be used. The use of an aid to navigation having cardinal 
meaning is discretionary provided that the use of such a marker is 
limited to wholly State owned waters and the State waters for private 
aids to navigation as defined and described in this part.
    (e) Aids to navigation conforming to the cardinal system shall 
consist of three distinctly colored buoys.
    (1) A white buoy with a red top may be used to indicate to a vessel 
operator that he must pass to the south or west of the buoy.

[[Page 161]]

    (2) A white buoy with a black top may be used to indicate to a 
vessel operator that he must pass to the north or east of the buoy.
    (3) In addition, a buoy showing alternate vertical red and white 
stripes may be used to indicate to a vessel operator that an obstruction 
to navigation extends from the nearest shore to the buoy and that he 
must not pass between the buoy and shore. The number of white and red 
stripes is discretionary, provided that the white stripes are twice the 
width of the red stripes.

                   Subpart 67.01--General Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 67.01-1  Scope.

    (a) The regulations in this part prescribe the obstruction lights 
and fog signals to be operated as privately maintained maritime aids to 
navigation on the artificial islands and structures which are erected on 
or over the seabed and subsoil of the Outer Continental Shelf and in the 
waters under the jurisdiction of the United States, for the purpose of 
exploring for, developing, removing and transporting resources 
therefrom.
    (b) Subpart 66.01 in Part 66 of this subchapter shall be applicable 
to all private aids to navigation erected on or over the Outer 
Continental Shelf in the same manner and to the same extent as they are 
applicable to private aids to navigation established, erected, or 
maintained in the waters under the jurisdiction of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 67.01-5  Definitions.

    (a) Structures. The term ``structures'' as used in this part shall 
include all fixed structures, temporary or permanent, for which a Corps 
of Engineers' permit is issued. It shall include, but is not necessarily 
limited to, all drilling platforms, production platforms, quarters 
platforms, pipe line riser platforms, manifold platforms, loading 
platforms, boat landings, caissons, well protective structures, tank 
battery barges submerged on station, drilling barges submerged on 
location, breakwater barges submerged on location, artificial islands 
and all other piles, pile clusters, pipes, or structures erected in the 
waters.
    (b) Class ``A'', ``B'', or ``C'' structures. The term ``Class A, B, 
or C structures'' refers to the classification assigned to structures 
erected in areas in which corresponding requirements for marking are 
prescribed.
    (c) Line of demarcation. The term ``line of demarcation'' means the 
dividing line used administratively to distinguish between the areas in 
which structures shall conform to Class ``A'' and Class ``B'' or ``C'' 
requirements.
    (d) Outer Continental Shelf. The term ``Outer Continental Shelf'' 
means all submerged lands lying seaward and outside the area of lands 
beneath navigable waters as defined in the Submerged Lands Act (sec. 2, 
67 Stat. 29, 43 U. S. C. 1301), and of which the subsoil and seabed 
appertain to the United States and are subject to its jurisdiction and 
control.
    (e) Reliable operation. The term ``reliable'' as used in this part 
shall mean that dependability which will insure to the highest degree 
reasonably possible the uninterrupted operation of lights and fog 
signals as private aids to navigation for safety of marine commerce.
    (f) Fog signal. The term ``fog signal'' as used in this part shall 
mean the audible sound signal, authorized as a private aid to 
navigation, to mark a structure for the safety of marine commerce 
whenever the visibility has been reduced by fog, mist, rain, falling 
snow, smoke, dust, or other phenomena.

Sec. 67.01-10  Authority to regulate and delegation of functions.

    Delegation of functions. The Coast Guard District Commander is 
hereby delegated responsibility for performing, or having performed the 
inspections, enforcement, and administration of such regulations, which 
are or may be required. He may redelegate this authority as necessary to 
any person from the civilian or military branch of the Coast Guard.

[CGFR 58-17, 23 FR 3378, May 20, 1958, as amended by CGFR 68-95, 33 FR 
15285, Oct. 15, 1968; USCG-1998-3799, 63 FR 35526, June 30, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 67.01-15  Classification of structures.

    (a) The varied depths of water and marine commerce traffic routes 
which exist in the waters over the Outer Continental Shelf, and in other 
waters, permits the classification of structures

[[Page 163]]

according to their location in such waters. Those structures in the area 
seaward of the line of demarcation, prescribed by the regulations in 
this part, are designated as Class ``A'' structures. All structures 
shoreward of the line of demarcation, prescribed by the regulations in 
this part, are designated as either Class ``B'' or Class ``C'' 
structures.
    (b) In the event a line of demarcation is not prescribed, the 
District Commander shall designate a structure ``A'', ``B'', or ``C'' as 
he deems appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 67.01-20  Prescribing lines of demarcation.

    In those areas where lines of demarcation are not prescribed, or 
where they have been prescribed and require modification, the District 
Commander shall submit his recommendations thereon to the Commandant for 
establishment or changes as required. When approved by the Commandant, 
and upon publication in the Federal Register, such additions or changes 
in lines of demarcation shall be effective for the purposes of this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 67.01-30  Equivalents.

    The use of alternate equipment, apparatus, or installation 
arrangements specified in this part may be permitted by the District 
Commander to such extent and under such conditions as will result in 
achieving a degree of safety or compliance with these regulations 
equivalent to or above the minimum requirements set forth in this part.


<R04>
             Subpart 67.05--General Requirements for Lights


<R05>
Sec. 67.05-1  Arrangement of obstruction lights.

    (a) Structures having a maximum horizontal dimension of 30 feet or 
less on any one side, or in diameter, shall be required to have one 
obstruction light visible for 360 deg..
    (b) Structures having a maximum horizontal dimension of over 30 
feet, but not in excess of 50 feet, on any one side, or in diameter, 
shall be required to have two obstruction lights installed on diagonally 
opposite corners, 180 deg. apart, or as prescribed by the District 
Commander, each light to have a 360 deg. lens.
    (c) Structures having a horizontal dimension of over 50 feet on any 
one side, or in diameter, shall be required to have an obstruction light 
on each corner, or 90 deg. apart in the case of circular structures, or 
as prescribed by the District Commander, each light to have a 360 deg. 
lens.
    (d) Where the overall dimensions of a structure require the 
installation of two or more obstruction lights, the lights shall all be 
mounted on the same horizontal plane within the limitations of height 
specified in Sec. 67.20-5, Sec. 67.25-5, or Sec. 67.30-5, as applicable.
    (e) Lesser structures and piles, pile clusters or flare templates, 
etc., will not normally be required to be marked by obstruction lights, 
when they are located within 100 yards of a Class ``A'', ``B'' or ``C'' 
structure marked by established obstruction lights, but they shall be 
marked with red or white retro-reflective material, installed as 
prescribed by the District Commander.
    (f) All obstruction lights shall be installed in a manner which will 
permit at least one of them to be carried in sight of the mariner, 
regardless of the angle of approach, until he is within 50 feet of the 
structure, visibility permitting.


<R05>
Sec. 67.05-5  Multiple obstruction lights.

    When more than one obstruction light is required by this part to 
mark a structure, all such lights shall be operated to flash in unison.


<R05>
Sec. 67.05-10  Characteristics of obstruction lights.

    All obstruction lights required by this part shall be powered from a 
reliable power source, including auxiliary power sources as necessary. 
They shall display a quick-flash characteristic of approximately 60 
flashes per minute, unless prescribed otherwise in the permit issued by 
the District Commander. Their color shall be white when marking Class 
``A'' and ``B'' structures, and either white or red, as prescribed by 
the District Commander, when marking Class ``C'' structures. In 
determining whether white or red lights shall be authorized, the 
District Commander shall take into consideration

[[Page 164]]

matters concerning, but not necessarily limited to, the dimensions of 
the structure and the depth of water in which it is located; the 
proximity of the structure to vessel routes; the nature and amount of 
vessel traffic; and the effect of background lighting.


<R05>
Sec. 67.05-15  Operating periods of obstruction lights.

    Obstruction lights shall be displayed at all times between the hours 
of sunset and sunrise, local time, commencing at the time the 
construction of a structure is begun. During construction and until such 
time as a platform capable of supporting the obstruction lights is 
completed, the fixed lights on an attending vessel shall be used. In 
addition, when lights are in use for general illumination to facilitate 
the construction or operation of a structure, and can be seen from any 
angle of approach at a distance equal to that prescribed for the 
obstruction lights for the class of structure, the actual operation of 
obstruction lights also will not be required.

[CGFR 58-34, 23 FR 7701, Oct. 4, 1958]


<R05>
Sec. 67.05-20  Minimum lighting requirements.

    The obstruction lighting requirements prescribed in this part are 
the minimum requirements only and shall not preclude the maintainer from 
making application for authorization to establish more lights, or lights 
of greater intensity than required to be visible at the distances 
prescribed: Provided, That the prescribed characteristics of color and 
flash duration are adhered to.


<R05>
Sec. 67.05-25  Special lighting requirements.

    Whenever a structure is erected in a position on or adjacent to the 
edges of navigable channels and fairways, or lines of demarcation, the 
District Commander is authorized to require the structure to be marked 
by the lights which in his judgment are necessary for the safety of 
marine commerce, and without regard to the fact that the structure may 
be located in an area in which either Class ``B'' or Class ``C'' 
requirements are otherwise applicable. The requirements for the lights 
in any of these cases, shall not exceed those established for structures 
in the Class ``A'' areas.

    (a) Description. See Sec. 3.40-1 of this chapter.
    (b) Lines of demarcation. The two lines of demarcation described in 
this section are for administrative purposes to distinguish between the 
areas in which structures shall be subject to Class ``A'', ``B'' or 
``C'' requirements. The primary line of demarcation delimits the areas 
to the seaward of which Class ``A'' requirements are imposed. The 
secondary line of demarcation delimits the areas to the shoreward of 
which Class ``C'' requirements are imposed. In those areas where no 
secondary line of demarcation is prescribed, the structures shoreward of 
the primary line of demarcation are considered to be Class ``C'' 
structures. Class ``B'' requirements are imposed on the structures in 
the areas between the two lines of demarcation.

casings (pipes), except bamboo poles and wooden stakes less than 2 
inches in diameter, placed in the water during seismographic or 
surveying operations shall be marked with flags during the daylight 
hours. Those casings remaining in place during the hours of darkness 
shall be marked by a red light as prescribed in Subpart 67.30 of this 
part.
    (2) All buoys used during seismographic operations shall be painted 
with international orange and white horizontal bands. The buoys shall be 
of

[[Page 174]]

light construction in order that they will not present a hazard to 
marine commerce.
    (d) Spoil marking. (1) All submerged spoil resulting from the 
dredging of channels, laying of pipelines, or any other operation, which 
constitutes an obstruction to navigation, shall be properly marked. The 
spoil banks should be examined at frequent intervals in order that the 
changing conditions may be kept under control. As markers are no longer 
required due to settling of banks, the Coast Guard will authorize their 
removal upon application.
    (2) All openings in such submerged spoil shall be marked by 
daybeacons on each side of the openings. When spoil is located on each 
side of a channel or pipe line, each bank will be considered separately. 
The daybeacons shall be equipped with arrows designating the safe water 
through the opening. These daybeacons may also be used as channel 
markers for the dredged channels providing they are also equipped with 
arrows designating the spoil bank openings.
    (3) When spoil banks constituting an obstruction to navigation abut 
an established traveled waterway, the outboard spoil bank markers shall 
be equipped with quick flashing lights described in Subpart 67.30 of 
this part, except that the color shall be in accordance with the 
provisions of Subpart 62.25 of Part 62 of this subchapter.
    (e) Applications. All applications for private aids to navigation 
and all correspondence dealing with private aids to navigation and 
obstruction lighting must be addressed to Commander (oan), Eighth Coast 
Guard District, Hale Boggs Federal Building, 501 Magazine Street, New 
Orleans, Louisiana 70130-3396.
    (f) Enclosures. Applicants shall append on a separate sheet with 
each application, the description, including manufacturer, of 
obstruction lights and fog signals.
    (g) Corps of Engineers correspondence. A copy of all correspondence 
directed to the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, in 
accordance with condition (i) of the Department of the Army permit, 
shall be forwarded to the District Commander for those operations 
conducted under permits authorizing the erection of structures in areas 
in which Class ``A'', Class ``B'', or Class ``C'' requirements must be 
met.

other obstructions to navigation.

    Charges for the establishment, maintenance, and replacement by the 
Coast Guard of an aid, either permanent or temporary, to mark a sunken 
wreck or other obstruction to navigation are calculated to recover the 
Coast Guard costs involved in, or associated with, the marking process. 
These charges will be invoiced to the owner of the obstruction. Charges 
for the removal of aids to navigation established by the Coast Guard 
will be invoiced to the owner unless the District Engineer requests the 
continued marking of the obstruction. All charges will be assessed in 
accordance with Subpart 74.20 of this part.

[CGD 81-051, 48 FR 15468, Apr. 11, 1983]

Sec. 74.01-15  Charges for placement of temporary aids.

    Charges for placement of temporary aids will be reimbursable and in 
accordance with Subpart 74.20 of this part. Where the placement of 
temporary aids other than those specified is made, a reasonable 
equivalence will be determined, and charges made accordingly.


<R05>
Sec. 74.01-20  Deposit of payment in special account.

    Whenever an aid to navigation or other property belonging to the 
Coast Guard is damaged or destroyed by a private person, such person 
shall pay to the satisfaction of the Coast Guard the cost of repair or 
replacement of such property. The Coast Guard will accept and deposit 
such payment in a special account in the Treasury for payment therefrom 
of the cost of repairing or replacing the damaged property. Funds 
collected in excess of the cost to make repairs or replacements shall be 
refunded.

requirements of this part are contained in COMDTINST 7310 (series) which 
is available from the District Budget Office of the appropriate Coast 
Guard District Commander.
    (b) Buoy and vessel use charges under this part are made for the 
cost or value of time, in hours, consumed by the Government vessel, 
including ship's complement, employed in marking the obstruction. No 
charge for time and expense of Coast Guard vessels is made when the 
marking of the obstruction causes only minimal interruption of routinely 
scheduled ship's duty.

General Services Administration as excess (if the equipment has been 
reported to the General Services Administration as excess, the 
Commandant will submit the request to that administration for further 
action); and
    (b) Such equipment is not readily procurable in the open market. 
Requests to purchase such apparatus or equipment shall give sufficient 
reasons why the article or articles cannot be readily procured in the 
open market. If the Commandant considers that an article can be readily 
procured in the open market the prospective purchaser will be so 
informed, and given the names of dealers or manufacturers. Sales shall 
be invoiced at cost plus 25 percent for overhead. Proceeds of such sales 
shall be deposited in the Treasury to the credit of the current

              SUBCHAPTER D--INTERNATIONAL NAVIGATION RULES

<R05>

    Special Note: Application of the 72 COLREGS to territories and 
possessions.
    a. Article III of the Convention on the International Regulations 
for Preventing Collisons at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), done at London, 
October 20, 1972, as rectified by Proces-Verbal of December 1, 1973, 
provides that a party may notify the Secretary-General of the 
International Maritime Organization (IMO, formerly Inter-Governmental 
Maritime Consultative Organization or IMCO) that it extends the 
application of the Convention to territory for which it is responsible 
for international relations. Since it is the intention of the United 
States that the 72 COLREGS apply to all U.S. territories and possessions 
to the same extent that the International Regulations for Preventing 
Collisions at Sea, 1960 (60 COLREGS) (16 USC 794, TIAS 5813) previously 
applied, the United States has given notice to the Secretary-General 
that the provisions of the 1972 COLREGS are applicable on July 15, 1977, 
to the following territories and possessions for which the United States 
is responsible for international relations:

Puerto Rico
Guam
The Canal Zone
The Virgin Islands of the United States
American Samoa
Midway Island
Wake Island
Johnston Island
Palmyra Island
Kingman Reef
Howland Island
Baker Island
Jarvis Island
Navassa Island

    b. In accordance with Article III, other parties to the Convention 
have notified the Secretary-General that application of 72 COLREGS is 
extended. These parties with their territorial extensions are listed in 
Table 1.

     Table 1. Territorial Extensions of Other Parties to 72 COLREGS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                               Territories to which 72
            Party to convention                 COLREGS are extended
------------------------------------------------------------------------
United Kingdom............................  Hong Kong.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Because earlier formulations of the COLREGS were not elaborated as 
treaties, they came into force by the almost simultaneous enactment of 
domestic legislation by the majority of maritime nations. The COLREGS 
were judicially considered as being customary international law, that is 
to say international law based upon the consensus of maritime nations 
rather than upon an express instrument. Because 72 COLREGS was 
elaborated as a treaty, and under usual treaty practice only parties are 
bound, there may be a period of time after the 72 COLREGS come into 
force during which the ships of a nation not party to 72 COLREGS might 
not be considered as being bound to comply with the convention. While it 
is most likely that the 72 COLREGS will rapidly achieve the status of 
customary international law, thereby obviating any concern on the part 
of the mariner as to whether a particular nation is a party, it does not 
necessarily follow that the courts in all nations will apply 72 COLREGS 
to the vessels of a non-party nation. In the absence of changes in their 
domestic law there may be certain nations that will feel compelled to 
continue 60 COLREGS in force, despite the coming into force of 72 
COLREGS.
    The following nations are Contracting Parties for which 72 COLREGS 
will apply upon the Convention's entry into force:

Algeria
Bahamas
Belgium
Brazil
Bulgaria
Canada
Denmark
Finland
France
German Democratic Republic
Germany, Federal Republic
Ghana
Greece
Hungary
Iceland
India
Liberia
Mexico
Monaco
Netherlands
New Zealand
Nigeria
Norway
Papua New Guinea
Poland
Romania
South Africa
Spain
Sweden
Switzerland
Syrian Arab Republic
USSR
United Kingdom
United States
Yugloslavia
Zaire

    The following nations have accepted the 60 COLREGS but are not 
Contracting Parties to 72 COLREGS:
Argentina
Australia
Austria
Barbados
Burma
China
Cuba
Cyprus
Czechoslovakia
Ecuador
Egypt
Fiji

<R05>
Sec. 81.1  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    72 COLREGS refers to the International Regulations for Preventing 
Collisions at Sea, 1972, done at London, October 20, 1972, as rectified 
by the Proces-Verbal of December 1, 1973, as amended.
    A vessel of special construction or purpose means a vessel designed 
or modified to perform a special function and whose arrangement is 
thereby made relatively inflexible.
    Interference with the special function of the vessel occurs when 
installation or use of lights, shapes, or sound-signaling appliances 
under 72 COLREGS prevents or significantly hinders the operation in 
which the vessel is usually engaged.

[CGD 77-136, 47 FR 13799, Apr. 1, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 81.3  General.

    Vessels of special construction or purpose which cannot fully comply 
with the light, shape, and sound signal provisions of 72 COLREGS without 
interfering with their special function may instead meet alternative 
requirements. The Chief of the Marine Safety Division in each Coast 
Guard District Office makes this determination and requires that 
alternative compliance be as close as possible with the 72 COLREGS. 
These regulations set out the procedure by which a vessel may be 
certified for alternative compliance. The information collection and 
recordkeeping requirements in Secs. 81.5 and 81.18 have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control No. 2115-0073.

[CGD 77-136, 47 FR 13799, Apr. 1, 1982]

Sec. 81.9  Certificate of Alternative Compliance: Contents.

    The Chief of the Marine Safety Division issues the Certificate of 
Alternative Compliance to the vessel based on a determination that it 
cannot comply fully with 72 COLREGS light, shape, and sound signal

Sec. 82.3  Pushing vessel and vessel being pushed: Composite unit.

    Rule 24(b) of the 72 COLREGS states that when a pushing vessel and a 
vessel being pushed ahead are rigidly connected in a composite unit, 
they are regarded as a power-driven vessel and must exhibit the lights 
under Rule 23. A ``composite unit'' is interpreted to be a pushing 
vessel that is rigidly connected by mechanical means to a vessel being 
pushed so they react to sea and swell as one vessel. ``Mechanical 
means'' does not include the following:
    (a) Lines.
    (b) Hawsers.
    (c) Wires.
    (d) Chains.

continuous deck. This height shall be measured from the position 
vertically beneath the location of the light.
    (b) High-speed craft means a craft capable of maximum speed in 
meters per second (m/s) equal to or exceeding: 3.7[dtri]\0.1667\; where 
[dtri]=displacement corresponding to the design waterline (meters 
<INF>3</INF>).

    Note to paragraph (b): The same formula expressed in pounds and 
knots is maximum speed in knots (kts) equal to exceeding 1.98 (lbs) 
[dtri]\0.1667\; where [dtri]=displacement corresponding to design 
waterline in pounds.

<R05>
Sec. 84.05  Horizontal positioning and spacing of lights.

    (a) Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, when two 
masthead lights are prescribed for a power-driven vessel, the horizontal 
distance between them must not be less than one quarter of the length of 
the vessel but need not be more than 50 meters. The forward light must 
be placed not more than one half of the length of the vessel from the 
stem.
    (b) On a power-driven vessel of 20 meters or more in length the 
sidelights shall not be placed in front of the forward masthead lights. 
They shall be placed at or near the side of the vessel.
    (c) When the lights prescribed in Rule 27(b)(i) are placed 
vertically between the forward masthead light(s) and the after masthead

1975, and is available from the Illumination Engineering Society, 345 
East 47th Street, New York, NY 10017. It is also available for 
inspection at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol 
Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. This incorporation by reference 
was approved by the Director of the Federal Register.
    (b) The boundaries of the area for each color are given by 
indicating the corner co-ordinates, which are as follows:
    (1) White:

<R05>
Sec. 84.15  Intensity of lights.

    (a) The minimum luminous intensity of lights shall be calculated by 
using the formula:

I=3.43x10\6\xTxD\2\xK<SUP>-D</SUP>

where I is luminous intensity in candelas under service conditions,
T is threshold factor 2x10<SUP>-7</SUP> lux,
D is range of visibility (luminous range) of the light in nautical 
miles,
K is atmospheric transmissivity. For prescribed lights the value of K 
shall be 0.8, corresponding to a meteorological visibility of 
approximately 13 nautical miles.

Sec. 84.17  Horizontal sectors.

    (a)(1) In the forward direction, sidelights as fitted on the vessel 
shall show the minimum required intensities. The intensities shall 
decrease to reach practical cut-off between 1 and 3 degrees outside the 
prescribed sectors.
    (2) For sternlights and masthead lights and at 22.5 degrees abaft 
the beam for sidelights, the minimum required intensities shall be 
maintained over the arc of the horizon up to 5 degrees within the limits 
of the sectors prescribed in Rule 21. From 5 degrees within the 
prescribed sectors the intensity may decrease by 50 percent up to the 
prescribed limits; it shall decrease steadily to reach practical cut-off 
at not more than 5 degrees outside the prescribed sectors.
    (b) All-round lights shall be so located as not to be obscured by 
masts, topmasts or structures within angular sectors of more than 6 
degrees, except anchor lights prescribed in Rule 30, which need not be 
placed at an impracticable height above the hull, and the all-round 
white light described in Rule 23(d), which may not be obscured at all.
    (c) If it is impracticable to comply with paragraph (b) of this 
section by exhibiting only one all-round light, two all-round lights 
shall be used suitably positioned or screened to appear, as far as 
practicable, as one light at a minimum distance of one nautical mile.

    Note to paragraph (c): Tow unscreened all-round lights that are 1.28 
meters apart or less will appear as one light to the naked eye at a 
distance of one nautical mile.

    (a) The masthead light of high-speed craft with a length to breadth 
ratio of less than 3.0 may be placed at a height related to the breadth 
lower than that prescribed in Sec. 84.03(a)(1), provided that the base 
angle of the isosceles triangle formed by the side lights and masthead 
light when seen in end elevation is not less than 27 degrees as 
determined by the formula in paragraph (b) of this section.

[[Page 215]]

    (b) The minimum height of masthead light above sidelights is to be 
determined by the following formula: Tan 27 deg.=<INF>X</INF>/
<INF>Y</INF>; where Y is the horizontal distance between the sidelights 
and X is the height of the forward masthead light.

 Note. The range of audibility in the table above is for information and is approximately the range at which a
  whistle may usually be heard on its forward axis in conditions of still air on board a vessel having average
  background noise level at the listening posts (taken to be 68 dB in the octave band centered on 250 Hz and 63
  dB in the octave band centered on 500 Hz).
In practice the range at which a whistle may be heard is extremely variable and depends critically on weather
  conditions; the values given can be regarded as typical but under conditions of strong wind or high ambient
  noise level at the listening post the range may be much reduced.


<R05>
Sec. 86.07  Directional properties.

    The sound pressure level of a directional whistle shall be not more 
than 4 dB below the sound pressure level specified in Sec. 86.05 in any 
direction in the horizontal plane within <plus-minus>45 degrees of the 
forward axis. The sound pressure level of the whistle in any other 
direction in the horizontal plane shall not be more than 10 dB less than 
the sound pressure level specified for the forward axis, so that the 
range of audibility in any direction will be at least half the range 
required on the forward axis. The sound pressure level shall be measured 
in that one-third octave band which determines the audibility range.


<R05>
Sec. 86.09  Positioning of whistles.

    (a) When a directional whistle is to be used as the only whistle on 
the vessel and is permanently installed, it shall be installed with its 
forward axis directed forward.

[[Page 217]]

    (b) A whistle shall be placed as high as practicable on a vessel, in 
order to reduce interception of the emitted sound by obstructions and 
also to minimize hearing damage risk to personnel. The sound pressure 
level of the vessel's own signal at listening posts shall not exceed 110 
dB(A) and so far as practicable should not exceed 100 dB(A).


<R05>
Sec. 86.11  Fitting of more than one whistle.

    If whistles are fitted at a distance apart of more than 100 meters, 
they shall not be sounded simultaneously.


<R05>
Sec. 86.13  Combined whistle systems.

    (a) A combined whistle system is a number of whistles (sound 
emitting sources) operated together. For the purposes of the Rules a 
combined whistle system is to be regarded as a single whistle.
    (b) The whistles of a combined system shall:
    (1) Be located at a distance apart of not more than 100 meters,
    (2) Be sounded simultaneously,
    (3) Each have a fundamental frequency different from those of the 
others by at least 10 Hz, and
    (4) Have a tonal characteristic appropriate for the length of vessel 
which shall be evidenced by at least two-thirds of the whistles in the 
combined system having fundamental frequencies falling within the limits 
prescribed in Sec. 86.03, or if there are only two whistles in the 
combined system, by the higher fundamental frequency falling within the 
limits prescribed in Sec. 86.03.

    Note: If due to the presence of obstructions the sound field of a 
single whistle or of one of the whistles referred to in Sec. 86.11 is 
likely to have a zone of greatly reduced signal level, a combined 
whistle system should be fitted so as to overcome this reduction.


<R05>
Sec. 86.15  Towing vessel whistles.

    A power-driven vessel normally engaged in pushing ahead or towing 
alongside may, at all times, use a whistle whose characteristic falls 
within the limits prescribed by Sec. 86.03 for the longest customary 
composite length of the vessel and its tow.


<R04>
                         Subpart B--Bell or Gong


<R05>
Sec. 86.21  Intensity of signal.

    A bell or gong, or other device having similar sound characteristics 
shall produce a sound pressure level of not less than 110 dB at 1 meter.


<R05>
Sec. 86.23  Construction.

    Bells and gongs shall be made of corrosion-resistant material and 
designed to give a clear tone. The diameter of the mouth of the bell 
shall be not less than 300 mm for vessels of more than 20 meters in 
length, and shall be not less than 200 mm for vessels of 12 to 20 meters 
in length. The mass of the striker shall be not less than 3 percent of 
the mass of the bell. The striker shall be capable of manual operation. 
Note: When practicable, a power-driven bell striker is recommended to 
ensure constant force.

            Subpart A--Certificate of Alternative Compliance


<R05>
Sec. 89.1  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart:
    Inland Rules refers to the Inland Navigation Rules contained in the 
Inland Navigational Rules Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-591) and the technical 
annexes established under that act.
    A vessel of special construction or purpose means a vessel designed 
or modified to perform a special function and whose arrangement is 
thereby made relatively inflexible.
    Interference with the special function of the vessel occurs when 
installation or use of lights, shapes, or sound-signaling appliances 
under the Inland Rules prevents or significantly hinders the operation 
in which the vessel is usually engaged.

<R05>
Sec. 89.3  General.

    Vessels of special construction or purpose which cannot fully comply

[[Page 221]]

with the light, shape, and sound signal provisions of the Inland Rules 
without interfering with their special function may instead meet 
alternative requirements. The Chief of the Marine Safety Division in 
each Coast Guard District Office makes this determination and requires 
that alternative compliance be as close as possible with the Inland 
Rules. These regulations set out the procedure by which a vessel may be 
certified for alternative compliance. The information collection and 
recordkeeping requirements in Secs. 89.5 and 89.18 have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 2115-0074.


<R05>
Sec. 89.5  Application for a Certificate of Alternative Compliance.

    (a) The owner, builder, operator, or agent of a vessel of special 
construction or purpose who believes the vessel cannot fully comply with 
the Inland Rules light, shape, or sound signal provisions without 
interference with its special function may apply for a determination 
that alternative compliance is justified. The application must be in 
writing, submitted to the Chief of the Marine Safety Division of the 
Coast Guard District in which the vessel is being built or operated, and 
include the following information:
    (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the applicant.
    (2) The identification of the vessel by its:
    (i) Official number;
    (ii) Shipyard hull number;
    (iii) Hull identification number; or
    (iv) State number, if the vessel does not have an official number or 
hull identification number.
    (3) Vessel name and home port, if known.
    (4) A description of the vessel's area of operation.
    (5) A description of the provision for which the Certificate of 
Alternative Compliance is sought, including:
    (i) The Inland Rules Rule or Annex section number for which the 
Certificate of Alternative Compliance is sought;
    (ii) A description of the special function of the vessel that would 
be interfered with by full compliance with the provision of that Rule or 
Annex section; and
    (iii) A statement of how full compliance would interfere with the 
special function of the vessel.
    (6) A description of the alternative installation that is in closest 
possible compliance with the applicable Inland Navigation Rules Rule or 
Annex section.
    (7) A copy of the vessel's plans or an accurate scale drawing that 
clearly shows:
    (i) The required installation of the equipment under the Inland

<R05>
Sec. 96.340  Safety Management Certificate: what is it and when is it needed?

    (a) Your U.S. vessel engaged on a foreign voyage must hold a valid 
Safety Management Certificate if it carries more than 12 passengers, or 
if it is a tanker, bulk freight vessel, freight vessel, or a self-
propelled mobile offshore drilling unit of 500 gross tons or more.
    (b) Your U.S. vessel may voluntarily hold a valid Safety Management 
Certificate even if your vessel is not required to by paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (c) Your U.S. vessel may only be issued a Safety Management 
Certificate or have it renewed when your company holds a valid Document 
of Compliance certificate issued under Sec. 96.330 of this part and the 
vessel has completed a satisfactory safety management audit of the 
vessel's safety management system set out in Sec. 96.320 of this part.
    (d) A copy of your vessel's valid Safety Management Certificate must 
be on board all U.S. and foreign vessels which carry more than 12 
passengers, and must be on board a tanker, bulk freight vessel, freight 
vessel, or a self-propelled mobile offshore drilling unit of 500 gross 
tons or more, when engaged on foreign voyages or within U.S. waters.
    (e) A Safety Management Certificate is valid for 60 months. The 
validity of the Safety Management Certificate is based on--
    (1) A satisfactory initial safety management audit;
    (2) A satisfactory intermediate verification audit requested by the 
vessel's responsible person, completed between the 24th and 36th month 
of the certificate's period of validity; and
    (3) A vessel's company holding a valid Document of Compliance 
certificate. When a company's Document of Compliance certificate expires 
or is revoked, the Safety Management Certificate for the company-owned 
vessel(s) is invalid.
    (f) Renewal of a Safety Management Certificate requires the 
completion of a satisfactory safety management system audit which meets 
all of the requirements of subpart B in this part. A

[[Page 238]]

renewal of a Safety Management Certificate cannot be started unless the 
company which owns the vessel holds a valid Document of Compliance 
certificate.
    (g) Only the Coast Guard may revoke a Safety Management Certificate 
from a U.S. vessel. The Safety Management Certificate will be revoked 
if--
    (1) The vessel's responsible person has not completed an 
intermediate safety management audit required by paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section; or
    (2) Major non-conformities are found in the vessel's safety 
management system during a safety management audit or other related 
survey or inspection being completed by the Coast Guard or the 
recognized organization chosen by the vessel's responsible person.

Interim Document of Compliance certificate applies to that vessel type;
    (2) The company's safety management system for the vessel includes 
the key elements of a safety management system, set out in Sec. 96.220,

Sec. 96.370  What are the requirements for vessels of countries not 
party to Chapter IX of SOLAS?

    (a) Each foreign vessel which carries more than 12 passengers, or is 
a tanker, bulk freight vessel, freight vessel, or self-propelled mobile 
offshore drilling unit of 500 gross tons or more, operated in U.S. 
waters, under the authority of a

[[Page 239]]

country not a party to Chapter IX of SOLAS must--
    (1) Have on board valid documentation showing that the vessel's 
company has a safety management system which was audited and assessed, 
consistent with the International Safety Management Code of IMO 
Resolution A.741(18);
    (2) Have on board valid documentation from a vessel's Flag 
Administration showing that the vessel's safety management system was 
audited and assessed to be consistent with the International Safety 
Management Code of IMO Resolution A.741(18); or
    (3) Show that evidence of compliance was issued by either a 
government that is party to SOLAS or an organization recognized to act 
on behalf of the vessel's Flag Administration.
    (b) Evidence of compliance must contain all of the information in, 
and have substantially the same format as a--
    (1) Document of Compliance certificate; and
    (2) Safety Management Certificate.
    (c) Failure to comply with this section will subject the vessel to 
the compliance and enforcement procedures of Sec. 96.380 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 96.380  How will the Coast Guard handle compliance and enforcement 
of these regulations?

    (a) While operating in waters under the jurisdiction of the United 
States, the Coast Guard may board a vessel to determine that--
    (1) Valid copies of the company's Document of Compliance certificate 
and Safety Management Certificate are on board, or evidence of the same 
for vessels from countries not party to Chapter IX of SOLAS; and
    (2) The vessel's crew or shore-based personnel are following the 
procedures and policies of the safety management system while operating 
the vessel or transferring cargoes.
    (b) A foreign vessel that does not comply with these regulations, or 
one on which the vessel's condition or use of its safety management 
system do not substantially agree with the particulars of the Document 
of Compliance certificate, Safety Management Certificate or other 
required evidence of compliance, may be detained by order of the COTP or 
OCMI. This may occur at the port or terminal where the violation is 
found until, in the opinion of the detaining authority, the vessel can 
go to sea without presenting an unreasonable threat of harm to the port, 
the marine environment, the vessel or its crew. The detention order may 
allow the vessel to go to another area of the port, if needed, rather 
than stay at the place where the violation was found.
    (c) If any vessel that must comply with this part or with the ISM 
Code does not have a Safety Management Certificate and a copy of its 
company's Document of Compliance certificate on board, a vessel owner, 
charterer, managing operator, agent, Master, or any other individual in 
charge of the vessel that is subject to this part, may be liable for a 
civil penalty under 46 U.S.C. 3318. For foreign vessels, the Coast Guard 
may request the Secretary of the Treasury to withhold or revoke the 
clearance required by 46 U.S.C. App. 91. The Coast Guard may ask the 
Secretary to permit the vessel's departure after the bond or other 
surety is filed.


<R05>
Sec. 96.390  When will the Coast Guard deny entry into a U.S. port?

    (a) Except for a foreign vessel entering U.S. waters under force 
majeure, no vessel shall enter any port or terminal of the U.S. without 
a safety management system that has been properly certificated to this 
subpart or to the requirements of Chapter IX of SOLAS if--
    (1) It is engaged on a foreign voyage; and
    (2) It is carrying more than 12 passengers, or a tanker, bulk 
freight vessel, freight vessel, or self-propelled mobile offshore 
drilling unit of 500 gross tons or more.
    (b) The cognizant COTP will deny entry of a vessel into a port or 
terminal under the authority of 46 U.S.C. 3204(c), to any vessel that 
does not meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

<R04>
Subpart D--Authorization of Recognized Organizations To Act on Behalf of 
                                the U.S.


<R05>
Sec. 96.400  Purpose.

    (a) This subpart establishes criteria and procedures for 
organizations recognized under 46 CFR part 8, subparts A and B, to be 
authorized by the Coast Guard to act on behalf of the U.S. The 
authorization is necessary in order for a recognized organization to 
perform safety management audits and certification functions delegated 
by the Coast Guard as described in this part.
    (b) To receive an up-to-date list of recognized organizations 
authorized to act under this subpart, send a self-addressed, stamped 
envelope and written request to the Commandant (G-MSE), 2100 Second 
Street SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001.


<R05>
Sec. 96.410  Who does this regulation apply to?

    This subpart applies to all organizations recognized by the U.S. 
under 46 CFR part 8, subpart A and B, who wish to seek authorization to 
conduct safety management audits and issue relevant international safety 
certificates under the provisions of the ISM Code and voluntary 
certificates on behalf of the U.S.


<R05>
Sec. 96.420  What authority may an organization ask for under this regulation?

    (a) An organization may request authorization to conduct safety 
management audits and to issue the following certificates:
    (1) Safety Management Certificate;
    (2) Document of Compliance certificate;
    (3) Interim Safety Management Certificate; and
    (4) Interim Document of Compliance certificate.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 96.430  How does an organization submit a request to be authorized?

    (a) A recognized organization must send a written request for 
authorization to the Commandant (G-MSE), Office of Design and 
Engineering Standards, 2100 Second Street SW, Washington, DC 20593-0001. 
The request must include the following:
    (1) A statement describing what type of authorization the 
organization seeks;
    (2) Documents showing that--
    (i) The organization has an internal quality system with written 
policies, procedures and processes that meet the requirements in 
Sec. 96.440 of this part for safety management auditing and 
certification; or
    (ii) The organization has an internal quality system based on ANSI/
ASQC C9001 for safety management auditing and certification; or
    (iii) The organization has an equivalent internal quality standard 
system recognized by the Coast Guard to complete safety management

    (3) A list of the organization's exclusive auditors qualified to 
complete safety management audits and their operational area; and
    (4) A written statement that the procedures and records of the 
recognized organization regarding its actions involving safety 
management system audits and certification are available for review 
annually and at any time deemed necessary by the Coast Guard.
    (b) If the organization is a foreign classification society that has 
been recognized under 46 CFR part 8, subparts A and B, and wishes to 
apply for authorization under this part, it must demonstrate the 
reciprocity required by 46 U.S.C. 3316 for ISM Code certification. The 
organization must provide, with its request for authorization an 
affidavit from the government of the country in which the classification 
society is headquartered. This affidavit must provide a list of 
authorized delegations by the flag state of the administration of the 
foreign classification society's country to the American Bureau of 
Shipping, and indicate any conditions related to the delegated 
authority. If this affidavit is not received with a request for 
authorization from a foreign classification society, the request for 
authorization will be disapproved and returned by the Coast Guard.

[[Page 241]]

    (c) Upon the satisfactory completion of the Coast Guard's evaluation 
of a request for authorization, the organization will be visited for an 
evaluation as described in Sec. 96.440(b) of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 96.440  How will the Coast Guard decide whether to approve an 
organization's request to be authorized?

    (a) First, the Coast Guard will evaluate the organization's request 
for authorization and supporting written materials, looking for evidence 
of the following--
    (1) The organization's clear assignment of management duties;
    (2) Ethical standards for managers and auditors;
    (3) Procedures for auditor training, qualification, certification, 
and requalification that are consistent with recognized industry

A.788(19);
    (5) Acceptable standards for internal auditing and management 
review;
    (6) Record-keeping standards for safety management auditing and 
certification;
    (7) Methods for reporting non-conformities and recording completion 
of remedial actions;
    (8) Methods for certifying safety management systems;
    (9) Methods for periodic and intermediate audits of safety 
management systems;
    (10) Methods for renewal audits of safety management systems;
    (11) Methods for handling appeals; and
    (12) Overall procedures consistent with IMO Resolution A.739(18), 
``Guidelines for the Authorization of Organizations Acting on Behalf of 
the Administration.''
    (b) After a favorable evaluation of the organization's written 
request, the Coast Guard will arrange to visit the organization's 
corporate offices and port offices for an on-site evaluation of 
operations.
    (c) When a request is approved, the recognized organization and the 
Coast Guard will enter into a written agreement. This agreement will 
define the scope, terms, conditions and requirements of the 
authorization. Conditions of this agreement are found in Sec. 96.460 of 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 96.450  What happens if the Coast Guard disapproves an organization's 
request to be authorized?

    (a) The Coast Guard will write to the organization explaining why it 
did not meet the criteria for authorization.
    (b) The organization may then correct the deficiencies and reapply.


<R05>
Sec. 96.460  How will I know what the Coast Guard requires of my organization 
if my organization receives authorization?

    (a) Your organization will enter into a written agreement with the 
Coast Guard. This written agreement will specify--
    (1) How long the authorization is valid;
    (2) Which duties and responsibilities the organization may perform, 
and which certificates it may issue on behalf of the U.S.;

    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 96.470  How does the Coast Guard terminate an organization's authorization?

    At least every 12 months, the Coast Guard evaluates organizations 
authorized under this subpart. If an organization fails to maintain 
acceptable standards, the Coast Guard may terminate that organization's 
authorization, remove the organization from the Commandant's list of 
recognized organizations, and further evaluate the organization's 
recognition under 46 CFR part 8.


<R05>
Sec. 96.480  What is the status of a certificate if the issuing organization 
has its authority terminated?

    Any certificate issued by an organization authorized by the Coast 
Guard

[[Page 242]]

    (a) Its original expiration date,
    (b) The date of the next periodic audit required to maintain the 
certificate's validity, or
    (c) Whichever of paragraphs (a) or (b) occurs first.


<R05>
Sec. 96.490  What further obligations exist for an organization if the Coast 
Guard terminates its authorization?

    The written agreement by which an organization receives 
authorization from the Coast Guard places it under certain obligations 
if the Coast Guard revokes that authorization. The organization agrees 
to send written notice of its termination to all responsible persons, 
companies and vessels that have received certificates from the 
organization. In that notice, the organization must include--
    (a) A written statement explaining why the organization's 
authorization was terminated by the Coast Guard;
    (b) An explanation of the status of issued certificates;
    (c) A current list of organizations authorized by the Coast Guard to 
conduct safety management audits; and

their safety management systems transferred to another organization 
authorized to act on behalf of the U.S.


<R05>
Sec. 96.495  How can I appeal a decision made by an authorized organization?

    (a) A responsible person may appeal a decision made by an authorized 
organization by mailing or delivering to the organization a written 
request for reconsideration. Within 30 days of receiving your request, 
the authorized organization must rule on it and send you a written 
response. They must also send a copy of their response to the Commandant 
(G-MOC).
    (b) If you are not satisfied with the organization's decision, you 
may appeal directly to the Commandant (G-MOC). You must make your appeal 
in writing, including any documentation and evidence you wish to be 
considered. You may ask the Commandant (G-MOC) to stay the effect of the 
appealed decision while it is under review.
    (c) The Commandant (G-MOC) will make a decision on your appeal and 
send you a response in writing. That decision will be the final Coast 
Guard action on your request.

effective period of the regulations with respect to each event, the 
geographical description of each regulated area, and details concerning 
the nature of the event and the number of participants and type(s) of 
vessels involved will be published in local notices to mariners. To be

of a designated Coast Guard Patrol Commander. The Patrol Commander may 
be contacted on Channel 16 (156.8 MHZ) by the call sign ``Coast Guard 
Patrol Commander.'' Vessels desiring to transit the regulated area may 
do so only with prior approval of the Patrol Commander and when so 
directed by that officer. Vessels will be operated at a no wake speed to 
reduce the wake to a minimum, and in a manner which will not endanger 
participants in the event or any other craft. The rules contained in the 
above two sentences shall not apply to participants in the event or 
vessels of the patrol operating in the performance of their assigned 
duties.
    (b) The Patrol Commander may direct the anchoring, mooring, or 
movement of any boat or vessel within the regatta area. A succession of 
sharp, short signals by whistle or horn from vessels patrolling the area 
under the direction of the U.S. Coast Guard Patrol Commander shall serve 
as a signal to stop. Vessels so signaled shall stop

[[Page 297]]

and shall comply with the orders of the Patrol Commander. Failure to do 
so may result in expulsion from the area, citation for failure to 
comply, or both.
    (c) The Patrol Commander may establish vessel size and speed 
limitations and operating conditions.
    (d) The Patrol Commander may restrict vessel operation within the 
regatta area to vessels having particular operating characteristics.
    (e) The Patrol Commander may terminate the marine event or the 
operation of any vessel at any time it is deemed necessary for the 
protection of life and property.

the Commandant retains discretion to adjust the MARSEC Level when 
necessary to address any particular security concerns or circumstances 
related to the maritime elements of the national transportation system.
    (d) The COTP may temporarily raise the MARSEC Level for the port, a 
specific marine operation within the port, or a specific industry within

<R05>
Sec. 109.01  Purpose.

    The purpose of the rules and regulations in this subchapter is to 
implement certain laws and set forth the requirements for anchorage 
areas.

(33 U.S.C. 471, 180, 258, 322, and 499; 49 CFR 1.46(c) and 1.45(b))

[CGFR 67-46, 32 FR 17727, Dec. 12, 1967, as amended by CGD 79-096, 44 FR 
51585, Sept. 4, 1979; USCG-1998-3799, 63 FR 35526, June 30, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 109.05  Anchorage grounds.

    (a) Section 7 of the River and Harbor Act of March 4, 1915 (33 
U.S.C. 471), authorizes the establishment of anchorage grounds for 
vessels in navigable waters of the United States whenever it is apparent 
that these are required by the maritime or commercial interests of the 
United States for safe navigation. The statute also authorizes the 
adoption of suitable rules and regulations regarding the establishment 
of anchorage grounds, which are enforced by the Coast Guard. The 
authority conferred by this statute was transferred to and vested in the 
Secretary of Transportation by section 6(g)(1)(A) of the Department of 
Transportation Act (80 Stat. 931) and delegated to the Commandant of the 
U.S. Coast Guard in Sec. 1.46 of Title 49 CFR, and redelegated the 
authority to establish anchorage grounds to each Coast Guard District 
Commander in Sec. 1.05-1(e)(1)(i) of this title.
    (b) District Commanders will, whenever matters relating to the 
anchorage of vessels are under consideration, ascertain the view of the 
District and Division Engineer, Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, and the 
proper representatives of other departments likely to be interested, 
including the Commandant of the Naval District concerned and the medical 
officer in charge of the quarantine station at localities where 
quarantine anchorages are involved, in order that they may arrange for 
suitable representation at such hearings. The views of the medical 
officer in charge of the quarantine station relating to the proposed 
location and boundaries of the quarantine anchorage will be accepted 
insofar as practicable and consistent with the establishment of other 
anchorage areas. (An Act of Congress approved July 1, 1944, as amended 
(42 U.S.C. 267), authorizes the Surgeon General, with the approval of 
the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, to designate the 
boundaries of the quarantine grounds and quarantine anchorages for 
vessels which are reserved for use at each United States quarantine 
station.) A notice of public hearing concerning changes to the Anchorage 
Regulations will be issued by the District Commander and will be mailed 
to all known interested parties. After providing an opportunity for 
public participation, the District Commander will, if circumstances so 
warrant, issue changes to the Anchorage Regulations, or in appropriate 
cases forward recommendations for such changes to the Commandant.
    (c) As soon as publication has been noted in the Federal Register,

Sec. 109.07  Anchorages under Ports and Waterways Safety Act.

    The provisions of section 4 (a) and (b) of the Ports and Waterways 
Safety Act as delegated to the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard in 
Pub. L. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135, authorize the Commandant to specify 
times of movement within ports and harbors, restrict vessel operations 
in hazardous areas and under hazardous conditions, and direct the 
anchoring of vessels. The sections listed in Sec. 110.1a of this 
subchapter are regulated under the Ports and Waterways Safety Act.

Sec. 109.10  Special anchorage areas.

    An Act of Congress of April 22, 1940, provides for the designation 
of special anchorage areas wherein vessels not more than sixty-five feet 
in length, when at anchor, will not be required to carry or exhibit 
anchorage lights. Such designation is to be made after investigation, by 
rule, regulation, or order, the procedure for which will be similar to 
that followed for anchorage grounds under section 7 of the River and 
Harbor Act of March 4, 1915, as referred to in Sec. 109.05. The areas so 
designated should be well removed from the fairways and located where 
general navigation will not endanger or be endangered by unlighted 
vessels. The authority to designate special anchorage areas was 
transferred to and vested in the Secretary of Transportation by section 
6(g)(1)(D) of the Department of Transportation Act (80 Stat. 931) and 
delegated to the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard under Sec. 1.46 of 
Title 49 CFR, who has redelegated pursuant to the authority to establish 
special anchorage areas to each Coast Guard District Commander in 
Sec. 1.05-1(e)(1)(i).

63 FR 35526, June 30, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 109.15  Enforcement proceedings.

    Proceedings against a vessel violating the Anchorage Regulations are 
to be brought in the name of the officer of the Coast guard assigned for 
the time being as Captain of the Port. When the vessel is at a port 
where there is no Coast Guard officer, proceedings will be initiated in 
the name of the District Commander.

Sec. 109.20  Publication; notice of proposed rule making.

    (a) Section 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), 
requires publication of general notice of proposed rule making in the 
Federal Register (unless all persons subject thereto are named and 
either personally served or otherwise have actual notice thereof in 
accordance with law), except to the extent that there is involved (1) 
any military, naval, or foreign affairs function of the United States or 
(2) any matter relating to agency management or personnel or to public 
property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts. Except where notice or 
hearing is required by statute, this requirement does not apply to 
interpretative rules, general statements of policy, rules of agency 
organization, procedure, or practice, or in any situation in which the 
agency for good cause finds (and incorporates the finding and a brief 
statement of the reasons therefor in the rules issued) that notice and 
public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to 
the public interest.
    (b) General notice of proposed rule making published in accordance 
with the above will include (1) a statement of the time, place, and 
nature of public rule making proceedings; (2) reference to the authority 
under which the rule is proposed; and (3) either the terms or substance 
of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues 
involved.

vessel has no mast, and shall display by night a red light in the same 
position specified for the flag.
    (8) When local regulations of any place require previous local 
authority for the transfer of explosives or fireworks between vessels or 
between a vessel and a wharf or other place ashore, the Captain of the 
Port will permit the removal from the anchorage of such vessel 
containing explosives to any place covered by such local regulations 
only when he is satisfied that the required local authority has been 
granted.

Jersey, outside of the anchorage areas established in this section, or 
within a cable or pipe line area shown on a Government chart, or be 
moored, anchored, or tied up to any pier, wharf, or other vessel in such 
manner as to obstruct or endanger the passage of any vessel. When an 
emergent condition exists due to congestion in the prescribed anchorage 
areas in the Delaware River, the Captain of the Port may authorize the 
anchorage of vessels in locations other than the prescribed areas. 
Vessels so anchored must not be anchored within the channel limits. Any 
vessel anchored outside of the prescribed anchorage limits must move to 
a prescribed anchorage area when space becomes available.
    (2) No vessel shall occupy any prescribed anchorage for a longer 
period than 48 hours without a permit from the Captain of the Port. 
Vessels expecting to be at anchor for more than 48 hours shall obtain a 
permit from the Captain of the Port for that purpose. No vessel in such 
condition that it is likely to sink or otherwise become a menace or 
obstruction to navigation or anchorage of other vessels shall occupy an 
anchorage except in an emergency, and then only for such period as may 
be permitted by the Captain of the Port.
    (3) Whenever, in the opinion of the Captain of the Port such action 
may be necessary, he may require any or all vessels in any designated 
anchorage area to moor with two or more anchors.
    (4) [Reserved]
    (5) Anchors shall be placed well within the anchorage areas, so that 
no portion of the hull or rigging will at any time extend outside of the 
anchorage area.
    (6) Light-draft barges using the anchorages shall be anchored away 
from the deeper portions of the anchorages, so as not to interfere with 
the anchoring of deep-draft vessels. Any barges towed in tandem to an 
anchorage area

[[Page 455]]

shall be bunched together when anchoring.
    (7) Upon approval of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, the 
Captain of the Port may permit wrecking plant or other vessels legally 
engaged in recovering sunken property, or in laying or repairing pipe 
lines or cables, or plant engaged in dredging operations, to anchor in 
channels. Such permission is not necessary for plant engaged upon works 
of river and harbor improvement under the supervision of the District 
Engineer, but the District Engineer will notify the Captain of the Port 
in advance of all such proposed work.
    (8) [Reserved]
    (9) A vessel upon being notified to shift its position shall get 
under way at once or signal for a tug and shall change position as 
directed with reasonable promptness.
    (10) Nothing in this section shall be construed as relieving any 
vessel or the owner or person in charge of any vessel from the penalties 
of law for obstructing navigation or for obstructing or interfering with 
range lights, or for not complying with the laws relating to lights and 
fog signals or other navigation laws and regulations.
    (c) Regulations for vessels carrying and handling explosives. (1) 
All vessels carrying explosives as defined in and subject to Title 49 
Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 171 through 177, or on which such 
explosives are to be loaded, shall obtain a permit from the Captain of 
the Port, except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. The 
maximum amount of explosives for which a permit is required in 49 CFR 
Parts 171 through 177, which may be carried or loaded at any time by a 
vessel shall not exceed 800 tons, except in cases of great emergency or 
by special permit from the Captain of the Port. This written permit 
shall be obtained from the Captain of the Port before vessels carrying 
explosives or on which explosives are to be loaded within the weight 
limit specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, may anchor in any 
anchorge. Permits will not be issued for Anchorage 2 under any 
circumstances. Such permit may be revoked at any time. All vessels used 
in connection with loading, or unloading explosives shall carry written 
permits from the Captain of the Port, and shall show such permit 
whenever required by him or his representative.
    (2) Vessels handling explosives shall be anchored so as to be at 
least 2,200 feet from any other vessel, but the number of vessels which 
may anchor in an anchorage at any one time shall be at the discretion of 
the Captain of the Port. This provision is not intended to prohibit 
barges or lighters from tying up alongside the vessels for the transfer 
of cargo.
    (3) Whenever a vessel or barge not mechanically self-propelled 
anchors while carrying explosives or while awaiting the loading of 
explosives, the Captain of the Port may require the attendance of a tug 
upon such vessel or barge when in his judgment such action is necessary.
    (4) Fishing and navigation are prohibited within an anchorage 
whenever occupied by an anchored vessel displaying a red flag.
    (5) The District Engineer, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, may 
authorize, in writing, a vessel carrying explosives for use on river and 
harbor works or on other work under Department of the Army permit, to 
anchor in or near the vicinity of such work. The Captain of the Port 
will prescribe the conditions under which explosives shall be stored and 
handled in such cases.
    (6) Vessels carrying explosives or on which explosives are to be 
loaded, within the weight limit specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, shall comply with the general regulations in paragraph (b) of 
this section when applicable.
    (7) Nothing in this section shall be construed as relieving any 
vessel or the owner or person-in-charge of any vessel, and all others 
concerned, of the duties and responsibilities imposed upon them to 
comply with the regulations governing the handling, loading or 
discharging of explosives entitled ``Subchapter C--Hazardous Materials 
Regulations'' (49 CFR Parts 171 through 177).

Sec. 110.214  Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors, California.

    (a) General Regulations--(1) Anchorage Assignment. (i) Unless 
otherwise directed by the Captain of the Port Los Angeles-Long Beach, 
the pilot stations for the Port of Long Beach and the Port of Los 
Angeles will assign the use of commercial anchorages within their 
jurisdictions (Long Beach and Los Angeles Harbors respectively). All 
anchorages outside (seaward) of the federal breakwater will be assigned 
by the Los Angeles-Long Beach Vessel Traffic Information Service (VTIS). 
The master, pilot, or person in charge of a vessel must notify the 
appropriate pilot station (for anchorages inside the federal breakwater) 
or the VTIS (for anchorages outside the federal breakwater) of their 
intention to anchor, upon anchoring, and at least fifteen minutes prior 
to departing an anchorage. All anchorage assignments will be made as 
described in this part unless modified by the Captain of the Port.
    (ii) Radio communications for port entities governing anchorages are 
as follows: Los Angeles-Long Beach Vessel Traffic Information Service, 
call sign ``LA-Long Beach Traffic,'' Channel 14 VHF-FM; Los Angeles Port 
Pilots, Channel 73 VHF-FM; Long Beach Port Pilots, Channel 74 VHF-FM.
    (iii) The exact boundary separating the Port of Long Beach from the 
Port of Los Angeles is published in local Port Tariffs. For purposes of 
this rule, Long Beach waters are those east, and Los Angeles waters are 
those west, of the following locations:
    (A) Inner Harbor: The Henry Ford (Badger Avenue) Bridge.
    (B) Middle Harbor: The Pier 400 Transportation Corridor.
    (C) Outer Harbor: The western boundary of Commercial Anchorage B.
    (2) Required approvals, permits and notifications.

[[Page 480]]

    (i) No vessel may anchor anywhere within Los Angeles or Long Beach 
harbors for more than 10 consecutive days unless an extended anchorage 
permit is obtained from the Captain of the Port. In determining whether 
an extended anchorage permit will be granted, consideration will be 
given, but not necessarily limited to: the current and anticipated 
demands for anchorage space within the harbor, the duration requested, 
the condition of the vessel, and the reason for the request.
    (ii) No vessel while carrying, loading, or unloading division 1.1 or 
1.2 materials as defined in 49 CFR 173.50, or Cargoes of Particular 
Hazard (COPH) as defined in 33 CFR 126.10, or Certain Dangerous Cargoes 
(CDC) as defined in 33 CFR 160.203, may anchor without first obtaining a 
permit issued by the Captain of the Port.
    (iii) Vessels requiring use of an explosives anchorage should 
contact the Captain of the Port at least 24 hours prior to the 
anticipated need for the explosives anchorage to allow for proper 
activation of that anchorage.
    (iv) Except with the prior approval of the Captain of the Port, or, 
in the case of an emergency, with approval of the Captain of the Port 
immediately subsequent to anchoring, no commercial vessel greater than 
1600 gross tons may anchor in Los Angeles-Long Beach Harbor unless it 
maintains the capability to get underway within 30 minutes. Any vessel 
unable to meet this requirement must immediately notify the Captain of 
the Port and make arrangements for an adequate number of tugs to respond 
to the vessel within 30 minutes notice.
    (v) In anchorages where lightering is authorized, the Captain of the 
Port must be notified at least 4 hours in advance of a vessel conducting 
lightering operations (see 33 CFR 156.118).
    (3) Other General Requirements.
    (i) When at anchor, all commercial vessels greater than 1600 gross 
tons shall, at all times, have a licensed deck officer on watch and 
maintain a continuous radio listening watch unless subject to one of the 
exemptions in this paragraph. The radio watch must be on CH-13 VHF-FM 
when anchored inside the federal breakwater, and on CH-14 VHF-FM or on 
CH-16 VHF-FM when anchored outside the federal breakwater, except for 
unmanned barges; vessels which have less than 100 gallons of oil or fuel 
onboard regardless of how the fuel is carried; and other vessels 
receiving advance approval from the Captain of the Port.
    (ii) When sustained wind speeds exceed 40 knots, all anchored 
commercial vessels greater than 1600 gross tons shall ensure their 
propulsion plant is placed in immediate standby and a second anchor is 
made ready to let go. Vessels unable to comply with this requirement 
must immediately notify the Captain of the Port. In such case, the 
Captain of the Port may require the vessel to have one or more tugs 
standing by to render immediate assistance.
    (4) Prohibitions. Within Los Angeles Harbor, Long Beach Harbor, and 
the Los Angeles-Long Beach Precautionary Area, except for emergency 
reasons, or with the prior approval of the Captain of the Port, vessels 
are prohibited from anchoring outside of designated anchorage areas. In 
the event a vessel anchors outside a designated anchorage area for 
emergency reasons, the master, pilot, or person in charge of the vessel 
shall:
    (i) Position the vessel so as to minimize the danger to other 
vessels and facilities;
    (ii) Immediately notify the Captain of the Port by the most 
expeditious means of the vessel's location and the reason(s) for the 
emergency anchoring; and
    (iii) Move the vessel as soon as the emergency condition prompting 
anchoring outside a designated area abates, or as soon as ordered to 
move by the Captain of the Port, whichever occurs sooner.
    (5) Exemption from rules. The Captain of the Port may, upon request, 
or whenever he/she deems appropriate, authorize a deviation from any 
rule in this section.
    (b) The anchorage grounds. Locations of anchorage grounds are as 
described in this section. Specific requirements for individual 
anchorages are contained in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. All 
coordinates referenced use datum: NAD 83.

    (1) Naval anchorages are intended for public vessels of the United 
States, but may be used by other vessels when not required for use by 
public vessels.
    (2) Other vessels using a naval anchorage shall promptly notify the 
Captain of the Port upon anchoring and upon departure and shall be 
prepared to move within one hour upon notice should the anchorage be 
required for public vessels.
    (c) Explosive anchorages. In addition to the general regulations in 
paragraph (a) of this section, the following regulations apply to each 
explosives anchorage described in this section.
    (1) Explosives anchorages and, where established, surrounding 
forbidden anchorage zones, are temporarily activated as needed by the 
Captain of the Port. When not activated, explosives anchorages and 
surrounding forbidden anchorage zones become part of the general 
anchorage which encompasses them or, if not located within the 
boundaries of a general anchorage, become available for general 
navigation.
    (2) Notice of activation and deactivation of explosives anchorages 
will be disseminated by Coast Guard Broadcast Notice to Mariners.
    (3) Each vessel which anchors in an explosives anchorage or 
surrounding forbidden anchorage zone while such anchorage is not 
activated shall be prepared to move within one hour if the anchorage is 
activated.
    (4) Unless otherwise authorized by the Captain of the Port:
    (i) No vessel may anchor in an activated explosives anchorage except 
vessels loaded with, loading, or unloading explosives.
    (ii) No vessel may enter or remain in an activated explosives 
anchorage except (A) vessels loaded with, loading or unloading 
explosives, (B) lighters or barges delivering cargo to or from such 
vessels, or (C) a tug authorized by paragraph (c)(7)(iii) of this 
section.
    (iii) No vessel carrying explosives or on which explosives are to be 
loaded may enter or remain in an activated explosives anchorage without 
written permission from the Captain of the Port. Such a permit must be 
obtained before entering the anchorage and may be revoked at any time.
    (iv) No vessel may anchor in the forbidden anchorage zone 
surrounding an activated explosives anchorage.
    (5) Each vessel loaded with, loading, or unloading explosives, while 
within an explosives anchorage, shall display by day at her masthead, or 
at least 10 feet above the upper deck if the vessel has no mast, a red 
flag at least 16 square feet in area.
    (6) Each passing vessel shall reduce speed as necessary so as to 
insure that its wake does not interfere with cargo transfer operations 
aboard any vessel displaying a red flag in an explosives anchorage.
    (7) The Captain of the Port may:
    (i) Issue permission to any vessel carrying flammable solids, 
oxidizing materials, corrosive liquids, flammable liquids, compressed 
gases, or poisonous substances to occupy a berth in an activated 
explosives anchorage. Such a permit must be obtained before entering the 
anchorage and may be revoked at any time.
    (ii) Require any person having business on board a vessel which is 
loaded with, loading, or unloading explosives to have a document that is 
acceptable to the Coast Guard for identification purposes and to show 
that document to the Captain of the Port.
    (iii) Require a non-self-propelled vessel, or a self-propelled 
vessel that is unable to maneuver under its own power, that occupies an 
activated explosives anchorage to be attended by a tug.
    (d) Anchorage grounds. (1) Table 110.224(d)(1) lists anchorage 
grounds, identifies the purpose of each anchorage, and contains specific 
regulations applicable to certain anchorages.
    (2) The geographic boundaries of each anchorage are contained in 
paragraph (e) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 114.10  General policies on issuance of permits and drawbridge 
operation regulations.

    The several bridge laws referenced in Sec. 114.01 Purpose, are 
intended to prevent any interference with navigable waters of the United 
States whether by bridges, dams, dikes or other obstructions to 
navigation except by express permission of the United States. The 
decision as to whether a bridge permit or a drawbridge operation 
regulation will be issued or promulgated must rest primarily upon the 
effect of the proposed action on navigation to assure that the action 
provides for the reasonable needs of navigation after full consideration 
of the effect of the proposed action on the human environment. The Coast 
Guard is not responsible for any other permits that the applicant may 
need from other federal, state, or local agencies and issuance of a 
bridge permit does not affect flood control projects or other 
governmental programs.

[CGD 82-006, 47 FR 36640, Aug. 23, 1982, as amended by USCG-2000-7223, 
65 FR 40056, June 29, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 114.20  Departure from permit plans.

    (a) If the final inspection shows a minor departure from the 
authorized plans which does not materially affect navigation, the 
permittee will be required to furnish a tracing showing the work as 
actually constructed but no further action will be taken by the Coast 
Guard.
    (b) It is not the practice of the Coast Guard to issue letters 
certifying that completed work conforms to that which was authorized. 
That question is a matter of fact to be determined in

[[Page 507]]

case of controversy by the usual rules of court procedure.


<R05>
Sec. 114.25  Work constructed without prior authority.

    The Commandant or District Commander will approve plans and issue 
permits authorizing bridges across navigable waters, in cases where the 
application therefor is submitted after the commencement or completion 
of the bridges subject to the following rules: Approval will be limited 
to those cases where the necessary primary authority, State or Federal 
as the case may be, validly existed, when the work was innocently 
constructed, and where the work will not unreasonably interfere with 
navigation. Upon issuance of the permit, applicant will be informed that 
the law contemplates prior approval and that in the future plans must be 
submitted in ample time for their consideration by the Commandant or 
District Commander before construction is begun.

(5 U.S.C. 559; 14 U.S.C. 633; 33 U.S.C. 401, 491, 499, and 525; 49 
U.S.C. 1655(g), and 49 CFR 1.46(c) and (q))

[CGD 80-099, 46 FR 38354, July 27, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 114.30  Revocation.

    Permits may be revoked by the issuing official for failure on the 
part of the permittee to comply with any of the conditions therein, or 
where the structures or other work constitute an unreasonable 
obstruction to navigation or to operations of the United States in the 
interest of navigation or flood control.

[CGD 82-006, 47 FR 36640, Aug. 23, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 114.40  Violations of law.

    The Coast Guard has the authority and responsibility for enforcement 
of the applicable provisions of law for the protection and preservation 
of navigable waters. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to secure 
compliance with these provisions of law short of legal proceedings. As a 
general principle, no action is taken when the violation is minor, 
unintentional, or accidental and the party responsible corrects the 
violation. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to implement civil or 
criminal proceedings in all other circumstances. These proceedings are 
in subpart 1.07 of Part 1 of this chapter.

(Secs. 107, 108, Pub. L. 97-322, 96 Stat. 1582; (33 U.S.C. 495, 499,

<R05>
Sec. 114.45  Applications, extensions of time.

    Extensions of time to commence or complete construction of a bridge 
or remove a bridge that has been replaced as an element of a permitted 
bridge project must be submitted to, and received by the District 
Commander at least 30 days before the existing permit expires to allow 
the permit to remain in effect until the final agency action is taken.

Sec. 114.50  Right of appeal.

    A District Commander's decision to deny a bridge permit application 
or an application for drawbridge operation regulations may be appealed 
to the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard. The appeal must be submitted in 
writing to the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration, 2100 Second 
Street SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001, within 60 days of the District 
Commander's decision. The Commandant will take action on the appeal

Sec. 115.01  Purpose.

    This part states the requirements for applying for a permit for 
construction of or modification to bridges crossing the navigable waters 
of the United States. It also sets forth the procedures by which the 
application is processed by the Coast Guard.

[CGD 82-006, 47 FR 36641, Aug. 23, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 115.05  Necessary primary authority.

    For bridges constructed by State or municipal agencies, the primary 
authority will be presumed without proof. If the law of the State 
requires a license for or approval of the bridge from a constituted 
State agency, a copy of such license or approval will be required and 
may be accepted as evidence of the primary authority. If there be no 
State regulation of bridges in navigable waters, the necessary primary 
authority may be that granted in the charter of a corporation, or the 
authority inherent in the ownership of the land on which the structure 
is placed. The applicant will in such cases be required to furnish an 
extract from the charter, or a statement of ownership. Especial care 
will be taken that Federal approval is not granted when there is doubt 
of the right of the builder to construct and utilize the bridge.


<R05>
Sec. 115.10  Limiting date in permits.

    (a) Specific time limitations are inserted in all permits for the 
commencement of construction and completion thereof. Normally three 
years for start of construction and two additional years for completion 
may be allowed.
    (b) Specific time limitations are inserted in all permits for the 
removal of bridges being replaced in whole or in part by the newly 
permitted bridges where removal thereof is required as a condition of 
the permit. Normally 90 days for removal after completion of the new 
bridge or opening to land transportation, whichever occurs first, may be 
allowed.

[CGD 75-046, 40 FR 24898, June 11, 1975, as amended by CGD 80-099, 46 FR 
38354, July 27, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 115.15  Permit bonds.

    When compensatory works or the removal of temporary structures 
should be required of the permittee, or in other unusual cases when 
there is reason to anticipate that the permittee may fail to carry out 
parts of the work that are against his interest, an additional condition 
will be included in the permit requiring the permittee to furnish a bond 
insuring compliance with the permit requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 115.20  Transfer of permits.

    Permits express merely the assent of the Federal Government so far 
as concerns the public rights of navigation. Although issued to a 
specific party, the assent is not limited to execution of the work by 
that party and may be availed of by the assignees or purchasers of the 
property affected, provided the terms of the instrument are strictly 
complied with.


<R05>
Sec. 115.30  Sufficiency of State authority for bridges.

    An opinion of the attorney general of the State as to the 
sufficiency of State authority for the construction of a bridge is 
acceptable to the Coast Guard in doubtful cases.


<R05>
Sec. 115.40  Bridge repairs.

    Repairs to a bridge which do not alter the clearances, type of 
structure, or any integral part of the substructure or superstructure or 
navigation conditions, but which consist only in the replacement of worn 
or obsolete parts, may, if the bridge is a legally approved structure, 
be made as routine maintenance without approval of the U.S. Coast Guard.

[[Page 509]]


<R05>
Sec. 115.50  Application for bridge permits.

    (a) Approval of plans. An application for authorization to construct 
a bridge across navigable waters of the United States must show the name 
and address of the applicant; the waterway and location of the bridge; 
citation to the act of Congress or the State legislature authorizing the 
bridge; be accompanied by a map of the location and plans of the bridge 
showing the features which affect navigation; and papers to establish 
the identity of the applicant.
    (b) Prior authority necessary. Except as provided under paragraph 
(c) of this section, a bridge cannot lawfully be constructed across any 
navigable waterway of the United States until the location and plans 
have been approved by the Coast Guard.
    (c) Prior authority not necessary. Coast Guard approval of the 
location and plans for construction or modification of a bridge or 
causeway is not required for any bridge or causeway over waters which 
are not subject to the ebb and flow of the tide and which are not used 
and are not susceptible to use in their natural condition or by 
reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign 
commerce, whether or not such waters were used or were susceptible to 
use, at some previous time, to transport commerce (historic use). This 
provision does not apply to bridges which connect the United States with 
any foreign country.
    (d) Form. The application for the approval of plans consists of a 
letter accompanied with maps and plans of the proposed structure.
    (e) Signature. In case of signature by an agent or by an official of 
a corporation, a duly authenticated copy of the authority for the action 
must accompany the application.
    (f) Identification. If the applicant is a corporation, it must 
furnish certified copies of the following papers, all properly 
authenticated: The charter or articles of incorporation; the minutes of 
organization; extract from minutes showing the names of the present 
officers of the corporation.
    (1) Where State laws vest in State or county officers, such as 
boards of supervisors and county courts, the power to authorize the 
construction of bridges, they must furnish with their application 
certified extracts from their proceedings showing their action 
authorizing the proposed structure.
    (g) Plans. Four sets of plans must be submitted with the 
application, on which the location of the work and the essential 
features covered by the application will be outlined in red. Each 
drawing must have a simple title, date and number, preferably in the 
lower righthand corner.
    (h) Size of sheets. The drawings will be on letter size sheets. As 
few sheets will be used as necessary to show clearly what is proposed.
    (i) Special instructions. (1) The scale will be shown graphically. 
The north and south line will be indicated by a meridian arrow. 
Soundings and elevations will be shown in feet and referred to the 
established Government datum plane at the locality.
    (2) The direction of currents will be indicated by an arrow, and the 
strength of currents, both ebb and flow, or low water and high water, 
will be shown close to the proposed location of the bridge, and at both 
ends of the waterway shown on the map of location.
    (3) The plans will show in figures the least clear height of the 
lowest part of the superstructure over navigation openings, with 
reference to the planes of mean high water and mean low water if the 
bridge is to cross tidal water. If the waters are nontidal, the least 
clear height will be shown with reference to the planes of extreme high 
water and mean low water. If records of river heights are available, the 
plane above which flood waters have not remained more than 2 percent of 
the time will be indicated. Reference will also be made to other datum 
planes if appropriate for the waterway in question.
    (4) If harbor lines have been established at the site of the bridge, 
their position will be shown on the plans.
    (j) Structural details. Only those should be shown which are needed 
to illustrate the effect of the proposed structure on navigation. If the 
bridge is to be equipped with a draw, the latter will be shown in two 
positions: closed and open.
    (k) To whom application should be presented. The application and the 
papers

[[Page 510]]

and plans accompanying it should be submitted to the District Commander 
having jurisdiction over the area in which the bridge site is located.

<R05>
Sec. 115.60  Procedures for handling applications for bridge construction permits.

    The following procedures will be observed in the handling of 
applications for permits to construct, modify, or replace bridges over 
navigable waters.
    (a) District Commander's review of application and plans. When an 
application is received, the District Commander verifies the authority 
for construction of the bridge, reviews, the application and plans for 
sufficiency, ascertains the views of local authorities and other 
interested parties, and ensures that the application complies with 
relevant environmental laws, regulations, and orders. If the application 
contains any defects that would prevent issuance of a permit (as for 
example, if the proposed bridge provided insufficient clearance), the 
applicant is notified that the permit cannot be granted and given 
reasons for this determination. The applicant may then request that the 
application be considered by the Commandant. If the applicant makes such 
a request, or if the applicaton is not found defective, the District 
Commander notifies the public that it has been received and continues 
its processing. A copy of this notification will be sent to the state, 
interstate agency or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
responsible for acting on requests for water quality certification for 
the project. If the state, interstate agency, or the EPA fails to issue 
or deny the water quality certification within 30 days after receiving 
the copy of this notification, the requirements for a water quality 
certification are waived. If the appropriate agency notifies the 
District Commander that the applicant has not filed a request for water 
quality certification, or requests additional time to review an 
application, additional time will be granted.
    (b) Public hearing. (1) Public hearings will be held when there are 
substantial issues concerning the effect that the proposed bridge will 
have on the reasonable needs of navigation.
    (2) Notice of the public hearing will be published in the Federal 
Register. Notice of the hearing is also mailed to State, county, and 
municipal authorities and all other known interested parties. It is also 
posted at the post office nearest the site and public places in the 
vicinity.
    (3) Hearings are public and conducted in an informal manner. A 
designated Coast Guard official presides. The submission of written 
statements is invited and encouraged. Anyone desiring to do so may 
speak. Statements, written or oral, are not under oath, and cross-
examination is not permitted. No fixed order has been established for 
the presentation of evidence or argument although proponents are 
generally heard first, followed by opponents with full opportunity 
afforded for rebuttals.
    (c) Report and recommendations. After the close of the comment 
period and any public hearings, a detailed statement of findings, 
conclusions, and recommendations based on all available information 
(including Coast Guard records and experience) is prepared. The 
following factors may be discussed in this report:
    (1) Comparison of proposed bridge with existing bridges over the 
waterway; attitude of local authorities; summary of objections raised by 
the public, and District Commander's comments or responses; probable 
effect on navigation, present and prospective.
    (2) Description of the navigation on the waterway past the site of 
the proposed bridge, the number and type of vessels, the number of 
vessel trips, and the principal method of handling traffic, whether in 
single vessels or in tows.
    (3) Whether the District Commander approves, or recommends approval 
of the plans. If they are found objectionable, the reasons for this 
finding will be stated. If there are objectionable features in the plans 
which may be corrected, the applicant is given an opportunity to revise 
them. If approval is given or recommended, all conditions

[[Page 511]]

to which the permit should be subject will be stated.
    (d) Action on permit application. (1) The District Commander may 
issue the permit if authorized under Sec. 1.01-60(b) of this chapter; 
otherwise, a report with the application shall be submitted to the 
Commandant for final action.
    (2) When an application is approved, the issuing official signs the 
permit and transmits it to the applicant.
    (3) When an application is not approved, the applicant is notified 
and provided with reasons for the disapproval, and suggestions for 
modifications that would justify reconsideration, if appropriate.
    (4) If an application is disapproved by the District Commander, the 
applicant may appeal this decision to the Commandant under Sec. 114.50 
of this chapter. The Commandant's determination shall constitute final 
agency action.
    (e) Permit amendments. Applications for amendments to permits will 
be processed in the same manner as permit applications. The District 
Commander may approve amendments to any permits which that official is 
authorized to issue under Sec. 1.01-60(b) of this chapter. All other 
amendments must be approved by the Commandant.

Sec. 115.70  Advance approval of bridges.

    (a) The General Bridge Act of 1946 requires the approval of the 
location and plans of bridges prior to start of construction (33 U.S.C. 
525). The Commandant has given his advance approval to the location and 
plans of bridges to be constructed across reaches of waterways navigable 
in law, but not actually navigated other than by logs, log rafts, 
rowboats, canoes and small motorboats. In such cases the clearances 
provided for high water stages will be considered adequate to meet the 
reasonable needs of navigation.
    (b) The term ``small motorboats'' shall be interpreted in the light 
of the things and conditions with which it is associated. The term means 
rowboats, canoes and other similar craft with outboard motors. It does 
not include sailing or cabin cruiser craft.

<R05>
Sec. 116.01  General.

    (a) All bridges are obstructions to navigation and are tolerated 
only as long as they serve the needs of land transportation while 
allowing for the reasonable needs of navigation.
    (b) This part describes the general procedures by which the U.S. 
Coast Guard determines a bridge to be an unreasonable obstruction to 
navigation and issues an Order to Alter under the authority of the 
following statutes, as appropriate: Section 18 of the Rivers and Harbors 
Appropriations Act of 1899, 33 U.S.C. 502; Section 4 of the Bridge Act 
of 1906, 33 U.S.C. 494; or the Truman-Hobbs Act of 1940, as amended, 33 
U.S.C. 511-524.
    (c) A bridge constructed across a navigable water of the United 
States shall not unreasonably obstruct the free navigation of the water 
over which it

[[Page 512]]

was constructed, either due to insufficient height or width of the 
navigation span, or because of difficulty in passing through the draw 
opening. If any bridge unreasonably obstructs navigation, the 
Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, will order the alteration of that bridge. 
Alterations may include structural changes, replacement, or removal of 
the bridge.
    (d) Whenever the Coast Guard has good reason to believe that a 
bridge across any of the navigable waters of the United States is an 
unreasonable obstruction to navigation, the Coast Guard will give notice 
to the owner of the bridge and other interested parties, and hold a 
public hearing at which the interested parties will have a full 
opportunity to be heard and to offer evidence on the question of whether 
alterations to the bridge are necessary and, if so, the extent of 
alterations needed.
    (e) If the Coast Guard determines that alterations to a bridge are 
necessary, the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, will issue to the bridge 
owner an Order to Alter containing details of the alterations necessary 
to render navigation through or under the bridge reasonably free, easy, 
and unobstructed.
    (1) In the case of a railroad or publicly owned highway bridge, an 
Order to Alter is issued to the bridge owner under the provisions of the 
Truman-Hobbs Act (33 U.S.C. 511 et seq.). In ordering these alterations, 
the Coast Guard will give due regard to the necessities of free and 
unobstructed navigation and of rail and highway traffic. For alterations 
to bridges governed by the Truman-Hobbs Act, the Coast Guard must 
approve general plans, specifications, and contracts for the alteration 
project, as well as approving the apportionment of the total cost of the 
alterations between the United States and the bridge owner.
    (2) For all other bridges, the Order to Alter will contain the 
required alterations for the bridge and will prescribe a reasonable time 
in which to accomplish the required alterations. The bridge owner is 
responsible for the entire cost of the required alterations.


<R05>
Sec. 116.05  Complaints.

    Any person, company, or other entity may submit to the District 
Commander of the Coast Guard district in which a bridge over a navigable 
water of the United States is located, a complaint that a bridge 
unreasonably obstructs navigation. The complaint must be in writing and 
include specific details to support the allegation.


<R05>
Sec. 116.10  Preliminary review.

    (a) Upon receipt of a written complaint, the District Commander will 
review the complaint to determine if, in the District Commander's 
opinion, the complaint is justified and whether a Preliminary 
Investigation is warranted.
    (1) The District Commander's opinion as to whether or not the 
complaint warrants a Preliminary Investigation will be formed through 
informal discussions with the complainant, users of the affected 
waterway, the owner of the bridge, and other interested parties.
    (2) In forming an opinion, the District Commander may also review 
the district files, records of accidents, and details of any additional 
written complaints associated with the bridge in question.
    (b) In the absence of any written complaint, the District Commander 
may decide, based on a bridge's accident history or other criteria, to 
conduct a Preliminary Investigation.
    (c) The District Commander will inform the complainant and the 
Chief, Office of Bridge Administration of the determination of any 
Preliminary Review. If the District Commander decides that the bridge in 
question is not an unreasonable obstruction to navigation, the 
complainant will be provided with a brief summary of the information on 
which the District Commander based the decision and will be informed of 
the appeal process described in Sec. 116.55. There will be no further 
investigation, unless additional information warrants a continuance or 
reopening of the case.

[[Page 513]]


<R05>
Sec. 116.15  Preliminary investigation.

    (a) During the Preliminary Investigation, the District Commander 
will prepare a written report containing all pertinent information and 
submit the report, together with a recommendation for or against the 
necessity of a Detailed Investigation, to the Chief, Office of Bridge 
Administration.
    (b) The Preliminary Investigation Report will include a description 
of the nature and extent of the obstruction, the alterations to the 
bridge believed necessary to meet the reasonable needs of existing and 
future navigation, the type and volume of waterway traffic, and a 
calculation of the benefits to navigation which would result from the 
proposed bridge alterations.
    (c) The Chief, Office of Bridge Administration will review the 
Preliminary Investigation Report and make a Preliminary Decision whether 
or not to undertake a Detailed Investigation and a Public Hearing.
    (d) If after reviewing the Preliminary Investigation Report, the 
Chief, Office of Bridge Administration decides that further 
investigation is not warranted, the complainant will be notified of the 
decision. This notification will include a brief summary of information 
on which the decision was based and details of the appeal process 
described in Sec. 116.55.

[CGD 91-063, 60 FR 20902, Apr. 28, 1995, as amended by CGD 96-026, 61 FR 
33663, June 28, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 116.20  Detailed investigation.

    (a) When the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration determines that 
a Detailed Investigation should be conducted, the District Commander 
will initiate an investigation that addresses all of the pertinent data 
regarding the bridge, including information obtained at a public hearing 
held under Sec. 116.25. As part of the investigation, the District 
Commander will develop a comprehensive report, termed the ``Detailed 
Investigation Report'', which will discuss: the obstructive character of 
the bridge in question; the impact of that bridge upon navigation; 
navigational benefits derived; whether an alteration is needed to meet 
the needs of navigation; and, if alteration is recommended, what type.
    (b) The District Commander will forward the completed Detailed 
Investigation Report to the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration for 
review together with a recommendation of whether the bridge should be 
declared an unreasonable obstruction to navigation and, if so, whether 
an Order to Alter should be issued.

[CGD 91-063, 60 FR 20902, Apr. 28, 1995, as amended by CGD 96-026, 61 FR 
33663, June 28, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 116.25  Public hearings.

    (a) Any time the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration determines 
that a Detailed Investigation is warranted, or when Congress declares a 
bridge unreasonably obstructive, the District Commander will hold a 
public hearing near the location of the bridge to provide the bridge 
owner, waterway users, and other interested parties the opportunity to 
offer evidence and be heard, orally or in writing, as to whether any 
alterations are necessary to provide reasonably free, safe, and 
unobstructed passage for waterborne traffic. The District Commander will 
issue a public notice announcing the public hearing stating the time, 
date, and place of the hearing.
    (b) When a bridge is statutorily determined to be an unreasonable 
obstruction, the scope of the hearing will be to determine what 
navigation clearances are needed.
    (c) In all other cases, the scope of the hearing will be to address 
issues bearing on the question of whether the bridge is an unreasonable 
obstruction to navigation and, if so, what alterations are needed.
    (d) The hearing will be recorded. Copies of the public hearing 
transcript will be available for purchase from the recording service.

<R05>
Sec. 116.30  Chief, Office of Bridge Administration Review and Evaluation.

    (a) Upon receiving a Detailed Investigation Report from a District 
Commander, the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration will review all 
the information and make a final determination of whether or not the 
bridge is an unreasonable obstruction to navigation and, if so, whether 
to issue an Order to Alter. This determination will be accompanied by a 
supporting written Decision Analysis which will include a Benefit/Cost 
Analysis, including calculation of a Benefit/Cost Ratio.
    (b) The Benefit/Cost ratio is calculated by dividing the annualized 
navigation benefit of the proposed bridge alteration by the annualized 
government share of the cost of the alteration.
    (c) Except for a bridge which is statutorily determined to be an 
unreasonable obstruction, an Order to Alter will not be issued under the 
Truman-Hobbs Act unless the ratio is at least 1:1.
    (d) If a bridge is statutorily determined to unreasonably obstruct 
navigation, the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration will prepare a 
Decision Analysis to document and provide details of the required 
vertical and horizontal clearances and the reasons alterations are 
necessary.
    (e) If the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration decides to 
recommend that the Commandant issue an Order to Alter, or a bridge is 
statutorily determined to unreasonably obstruct navigation, the Chief, 
Office of Bridge Administration will issue a letter to the bridge owner 
(``The 60-Day Letter'') at least 60 days before the Commandant issues an 
Order to Alter. This letter will contain the reasons an alteration is 
necessary, the proposed alteration, and, in the case of a Truman-Hobbs 
bridge, an estimate of the total project cost and the bridge owner's 
share.
    (f) If the bridge owner does not agree with the terms proposed in 
the 60-Day Letter, the owner may request a reevaluation of the terms. 
The request for a reevaluation must be in writing, and identify the 
terms for which reevaluation is requested. The request may provide 
additional information not previously presented.
    (g) Upon receipt of the bridge owner's response, the Chief, Office 
of Bridge Administration will reevaluate the situation based on the 
additional information submitted by the bridge owner. If after the 
Chief, Office of Bridge Administration reviews the determination, there 
is no change, the Commandant may issue an Order to Alter as set out in 
Sec. 116.35. The Chief, Office of Bridge Administration determination 
based on the reevaluation will constitute final agency action.

[CGD 91-063, 60 FR 20902, Apr. 28, 1995, as amended by CGD 96-026, 61 FR 
33664, June 28, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 116.35  Order to Alter.

    (a) If the bridge owner agrees with the contents of the 60-Day 
Letter, if no reply is received by 60 days after the issuance of the 
letter, or if after reevaluation a bridge is determined to be an 
unreasonable obstruction to navigation, the Commandant will issue an 
Order to Alter.
    (1) If a bridge is eligible for funding under the Truman-Hobbs Act, 
the Order to Alter will specify the navigational clearances to be 
accomplished in order to meet the reasonable needs of navigation.
    (2) An Order to Alter for a bridge that is not eligible for Truman-
Hobbs funding will specify the navigational clearances that are required 
to meet the reasonable needs of navigation and will prescribe a 
reasonable time in which to accomplish them.
    (b) If appropriate, the Order to Alter will be accompanied by a 
letter of special conditions setting forth safeguards needed to protect 
the environment or to provide for any special needs of navigation.
    (c) If a proposed alteration to a bridge has desirable, non-
navigational benefits, the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration may 
require an equitable contribution from any interested person, firm, 
association, corporation, municipality, county, or state benefiting from 
the alteration as a prerequisite to the making of an Order to Alter for 
that alteration.
    (d) Failure to comply with any Order to Alter issued under the 
provisions of this part will subject the owner or controller of the 
bridge to the penalties

prescribed in 33 U.S.C. 495, 502, 519, or any other applicable 
provision.

Sec. 116.40  Plans and specifications under the Truman-Hobbs Act.

    (a) After an Order to Alter has been issued to a bridge owner under 
the Truman-Hobbs Act, the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration will 
issue a letter to the bridge owner outlining the owner's 
responsibilities to submit plans and specifications to the Chief, Office 
of Bridge Administration for the alteration of the bridge. The plans and 
specifications, at a minimum, must provide for the clearances identified 
in the Order to Alter. The plans and specifications may also include any 
other additional alteration to the bridge that the owner considers 
desirable to meet the requirements of railroad or highway traffic. 
During the alteration process, balanced consideration shall be given to 
the needs of rail, highway, and marine traffic.
    (b) The Chief, Office of Bridge Administration will approve or 
reject the plans and specifications submitted by the bridge owner, in 
whole or in part, and may require the submission of new or additional 
plans and specifications.
    (c) When Chief, Office of Bridge Administration has approved the 
submitted plans and specifications, they are final and binding upon all 
parties, unless later changes are approved by the Chief, Office of 
Bridge Administration. Any changes to the approved plans will be 
coordinated with the District Commander.

<R05>
Sec. 116.45  Submission of bids, approval of award, guaranty of cost, and 
partial payments for bridges eligible for funding under the Truman-Hobbs Act.

    (a) Once the plans and specifications for a bridge eligible for 
funding under the Truman-Hobbs Act have been approved, the bridge owner 
must take bids for the alteration of the bridge consistent with the 
approved plans and specifications. Those bids must then be submitted to 
the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration for approval.
    (b) After the bridge owner submits the guaranty of cost required by 
33 U.S.C. 515, the Chief, Office of Bridge Administration authorizes the 
owner to award the contract.
    (c) Partial payments of the government's costs are authorized as the 
work progresses to the extent that funds have been appropriated.

[CGD 91-063, 60 FR 20902, Apr. 28, 1995, as amended by CGD 96-026, 61 FR 
33664, June 28, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 116.50  Apportionment of costs under the Truman-Hobbs Act.

    (a) In determining the apportionment of costs, the bridge owner must 
bear such part of the cost attributable to the direct and special 
benefits which will accrue to the bridge owner as a result of alteration 
to the bridge, including expected savings in repairs and maintenance, 
expected increased carrying capacity, costs attributable to the 
requirements of highway and railroad traffic, and actual capital costs 
of the used service life. The United States will bear the balance of the 
costs, including that part attributable to the necessities of 
navigation.
    (b) ``Direct and special benefits'' ordinarily will include items 
desired by the owner but which have no counterpart or are of higher 
quality than similar items in the bridge prior to alteration. Examples 
include improved signal and fender systems, pro rata share of 
dismantling costs, and improvements included, but not required, in the 
interests of navigation.
    (c) During the development of the Apportionment of Costs, the bridge 
owner will be provided with an opportunity to be heard. Proportionate 
shares of cost to be borne by the United States and the bridge owner are 
developed in substantially the following form:

Total cost of project -------- $--------
    Less salvage -------- $--------
    Less contribution by third party -------- $--------
Cost of alteration to be apportioned -------- $--------
Share to be borne by the bridge owner:
Direct and Special Benefits:
    a. Removing old bridge -------- $--------
    b. Fixed charges -------- $--------

[[Page 516]]

    c. Betterments -------- $--------
Expected savings in repair or maintenance costs:
    a. Repair -------- $--------
    b. Maintenance -------- $--------
Costs attributable to requirements of railroad and/or highway traffic --
          ------ $--------
Expenditure for increased carrying capacity -------- $--------
Expired service life of old bridge -------- $--------
    Subtotal -------- $--------
Share to be borne by the bridge owner -------- $--------
    Contingencies -------- $--------
    Total -------- $--------
Share to be borne by the United States -------- $--------
    Contingencies -------- $--------
    Total -------- $--------

    (d) The Order of Apportionment of Costs will include the guaranty of 
costs.


<R05>
Sec. 116.55  Appeals.

    (a) Except for the decision to issue an Order to Alter, if a 
complainant disagrees with a recommendation regarding obstruction or 
eligibility made by a District Commander, or the Chief, Office of Bridge 
Administration, the complainant may appeal that decision to the 
Assistant Commandant for Operations.
    (b) The appeal must be submitted in writing to the Assistant 
Commandant for Operations, U.S. Coast Guard, 2100 Second Street, SW., 
Washington, DC 20593-0001, within 60 days after the District Commander's 
or the Chief's, Office of Bridge Administration decision. The Assistant 
Commandant for Operations will make a decision on the appeal within 90 
days after receipt of the appeal. The Assistant Commandant for 
Operations' decision of this appeal shall constitute final agency 
action.
    (c) Any Order of Apportionment made or issued under section 6 of the 
Truman-Hobbs Act, 33 U.S.C. 516, may be reviewed by the Court of Appeals 
for any judicial circuit in which the bridge in question is wholly or 
partly located, if a petition for review is filed within 90 days after 
the date of issuance of the order. The review is described in section 10 
of the Truman-Hobbs Act, 33 U.S.C. 520. The review proceedings do not 
operate as a stay of any order issued under the Truman-Hobbs Act, other 
than an order of apportionment, nor relieve any bridge owner of any 
liability or penalty under other provisions of that act.

Appendix A to Part 117--Drawbridges Equipped With Radiotelephones

    Authority: 33 U.S.C. 499; 49 CFR 1.46; 33 CFR 1.05-1(g); section 
117.255 also issued under the authority of Pub. L. 102-587, 106 Stat. 
5039.

    Source: CGD 82-025, 49 FR 17452, Apr. 24, 1984, unless otherwise 
noted.

    Editorial Note: Nomenclature changes to part 117 appear at 63 FR 
35529, June 30, 1998.


<R04>
                     Subpart A--General Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 117.1  Purpose.

    This subpart prescribes general requirements relating to the use and 
operation of drawbridges across the navigable waters of the United 
States.

    Note: The primary jurisdiction to regulate drawbridges across the 
navigable waters of the United States is vested in the Federal 
Government. Laws, ordinances, regulations, and rules which purport to 
regulate these bridges and which are not promulgated by the Federal 
Government have no force and effect.


<R05>
Sec. 117.3  Applicability.

    The provisions of this subpart not in conflict with the provisions 
of Subpart B apply to each drawbridge.

    Note: For all of the requirements applicable to a drawbridge listed 
in Subpart B, one must review the requirements in Subpart A and 
Secs. 117.51 through 117.99 of Subpart B, as well as the requirements in 
Subpart B applicable to the particular drawbridge in question.


<R05>
Sec. 117.4  Definitions.

    Certain terms used in this part are defined in this section.
    Appurtenance. The term ``appurtenance'' means an attachment or 
accessory extending beyond the hull or superstructure that is not an 
integral part of the vessel and is not needed for a vessel's piloting, 
propelling, controlling, or collision avoidance capabilities.
    Lowerable. The term ``lowerable'' means the nonstructural vessel 
appurtenance can be mechanically or manually lowered and raised again. 
The term ``lowerable'' also applies to a nonstructural vessel 
appurtenance which can be modified to make the item flexible, hinged, 
collapsible, or telescopic such that it can be mechanically or manually 
lowered and raised again. Failure to make the modification is considered 
equivalent to refusing to lower a lowerable nonstructural appurtenance 
that is not essential to navigation. Examples of appurtenances which are 
considered to be lowerable include, but are not limited to, fishing 
outriggers, radio antennae, television antennae, false stacks, and masts 
purely for ornamental purposes. Examples of appurtenances which are not 
considered to be lowerable include, but are not limited to, radar 
antennae, flying bridges, sailboat masts, piledriver leads, spud frames 
on hydraulic dredges, drilling derricks' substructures and buildings, 
cranes on drilling or construction vessels, or other items of permanent 
and fixed equipment.
    Nonstructural. The term ``nonstructural'' means that the item is not 
rigidly fixed to the vessel and is thus susceptible to relocation or 
alteration.
    Not essential to navigation. The term ``not essential to 
navigation'' means

[[Page 522]]

the nonstructural vessel appurtenance does not adversely affect the 
vessel's piloting, propulsion, control, or collision avoidance 
capabilities when in the lowered position.

[CGD 91-059, 59 FR 16563, Apr. 7, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 117.5  When the draw shall open.

    Except as otherwise required by this subpart, drawbridges shall open 
promptly and fully for the passage of vessels when a request to open is 
given in accordance with this subpart.

    Editorial Note: For Federal Register citations relating to temporary 
deviations from the regulatory provisions in Sec. 117.5, see the List of 
CFR Sections Affected, which appears in the Finding Aids section of the 
printed volume and on GPO Access.


<R05>
Sec. 117.7  General duties of drawbridge owners and tenders.

    (a) Drawbridge owners and tenders shall operate the draw in 
accordance with the requirement in this part.
    (b) Except for drawbridges not required to open for the passage of 
vessels, owners of drawbridges shall ensure that:
    (1) The necessary drawtenders are provided for the safe and prompt 
opening of the draw;
    (2) The operating machinery of the draw is maintained in a 
serviceable condition; and.
    (3) The draws are operated at sufficient intervals to assure their 
satisfactory operation.


<R05>
Sec. 117.9  Delaying opening of a draw.

    No person shall unreasonably delay the opening of a draw after the 
signals required by Sec. 117.15 have been given.

    Note: Trains are usually controlled by the block method. That is, 
the track is divided into blocks or segments of a mile or more in 
length. When a train is in a block with a drawbridge, the draw may not 
be able to open until the train has passed out of the block and the 
yardmaster or other manager has ``unlocked'' the drawbridge controls. 
The maximum time permitted for delay is defined in Subpart B for each 
affected bridge. Land and water traffic should pass over or through the 
draw as soon as possible in order to prevent unnecessary delays in the 
opening and closure of the draw.


<R05>
Sec. 117.11  Unnecessary opening of the draw.

    No vessel owner or operator shall--
    (a) Signal a drawbridge to open if the vertical clearance is 
sufficient to allow the vessel, after all lowerable nonstructural vessel 
appurtenances that are not essential to navigation have been lowered, to 
safely pass under the drawbridge in the closed position; or
    (b) Signal a drawbridge to open for any purpose other than to pass 
through the drawbridge opening.

[CGD 91-059, 59 FR 16563, Apr. 7, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 117.15  Signals.

    (a) General. (1) The operator of each vessel requesting a drawbridge 
to open shall signal the drawtender and the drawtender shall acknowledge 
that signal. The signal shall be repeated until acknowledged in some 
manner by the drawtender before proceeding.
    (2) The signals used to request the opening of the draw and to 
acknowledge that request shall be sound signals, visual signals, or 
radiotelephone communications described in this subpart.
    (3) Any of the means of signaling described in this subpart 
sufficient to alert the party being signaled may be used.
    (b) Sound signals. (1) Sound signals shall be made by whistle, horn, 
megaphone, hailer, or other device capable of producing the described 
signals loud enough to be heard by the drawtender.
    (2) As used in this section, ``prolonged blast'' means a blast of 
four to six seconds duration and ``short blast'' means a blast of 
approximately one second duration.
    (3) The sound signal to request the opening of a draw is one 
prolonged blast followed by one short blast sounded not more than three 
seconds after the prolonged blast. For vessels required to be passed 
through a draw during a scheduled closure period, the sound signal to 
request the opening of the draw during that period is five short blasts 
sounded in rapid succession.
    (4) When the draw can be opened immediately, the sound signal to 
acknowledge a request to open the draw is one prolonged blast followed 
by one

[[Page 523]]

short blast sounded not more than 30 seconds after the requesting 
signal.
    (5) When the draw cannot be opened immediately, or is open and shall 
be closed promptly, the sound signal to acknowledge a request to open 
the draw is five short blasts sounded in rapid succession not more than 
30 seconds after the vessel's opening signal. The signal shall be 
repeated until acknowledged in some manner by the requesting vessel.
    (c) Visual signals. (1) The visual signal to request the opening of 
a draw is--
    (i) A white flag raised and lowered vertically; or
    (ii) A white, amber, or green light raised and lowered vertically.
    (2) When the draw can be opened immediately, the visual signal to 
acknowledge a request to open the draw, given not more than 30 seconds 
after the vessel's opening signal, is--
    (i) A white flag raised and lowered vertically;
    (ii) A white, amber, or green light raised and lowered vertically; 
or
    (iii) A fixed or flashing white, amber, or green light or lights.
    (3) When the draw cannot be opened immediately, or is open and must 
be closed promptly, the visual signal to acknowledge a request to open 
the draw is--
    (i) A red flag or red light swung back and forth horizontally in 
full sight of the vessel given not more than 30 seconds after the 
vessel's opening signal; or
    (ii) A fixed or flashing red light or lights given not more than 30 
seconds after the vessel's opening signal.
    (4) The acknowledging signal when the draw cannot open immediately 
or is open and must be closed promptly shall be repeated until 
acknowledged in some manner by the requesting vessel.
    (d) Radio telephone communications. (1) Radiotelephones may be used 
to communicate the same information provided by sound and visual 
signals.

    Note: Call signs and radio channels for drawbridges with 
radiotelephones are listed in Appendix A to this part.

    (2) The vessel and the drawtender shall monitor the frequency used 
until the vessel has cleared the draw.
    (3) When radiotelephone contact cannot be initiated or maintained, 
sound or visual signals under this section shall be used.

[CGD 82-025, 49 FR 17452, Apr. 24, 1984, as amended by CGD 82-025, 50 FR 
11366, Mar. 21, 1985; CGD 84-022, 51 FR 16308, May 2, 1986; CGD 96-026, 
61 FR 33664, June 28, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 117.17  Signalling for contiguous drawbridges.

    When a vessel must past two or more drawbridges close together, the 
opening signal is given for the first bridge. After acknowledgment from 
the first bridge that it will promptly open, the opening signal is given 
for the second bridge, and so on until all bridges that the vessel must 
pass have been given the opening signal and have acknowledged that they 
will open promptly.


<R05>
Sec. 117.19  Signalling when two or more vessels are approaching a drawbridge.

    When two or more vessels are approaching the same drawbridge at the 
same time, or nearly the same, time, whether from the same or opposite 
directions, each vessel shall signal independently for the opening of 
the draw and the drawtender shall reply in turn to the signal of each 
vessel. The drawtender need not reply to signals by vessels accumulated 
at the bridge for passage during a scheduled open period.


<R05>
Sec. 117.21  Signalling for an opened drawbridge.

    When a vessel approaches a drawbridge with the draw in the open 
position, the vessel shall give the opening signal. If no acknowledgment 
is received within 30 seconds, the vessel may proceed, with caution, 
through the open draw.


<R05>
Sec. 117.23  Installation of radiotelephones.

    (a) When the District Commander deems it necessary for reasons of 
safety of navigation, the District Commander may require the 
installation and operation or a radiotelephone on or near a drawbridge.
    (b) The District Commander gives written notice of the proposed 
requirement to the bridge owner.

[[Page 524]]

    (c) All comments the owner wishes to submit shall be submitted to 
the District Commander within 30 days of receipt of the notice under 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) If, upon consideration of the comments received, the District 
Commander determines that a radiotelephone is necessary, the District 
Commander notifies the bridge owner that a radiotelephone shall be 
installed and gives a reasonable time, not to exceed six months, to 
install the radiotelephone and commence operation.


<R05>
Sec. 117.24  Radiotelephone installation identification.

    (a) The Coast Guard authorizes, and the District Commander may 
require the installation of a sign on drawbridges, on the upstream and 
downstream sides, indicating that the bridge is equipped with and 
operates a VHF radiotelephone in accordance with Sec. 117.23.
    (b) The sign shall give notice of the radiotelephone and its calling 
and working channels--
    (1) In plain language; or
    (2) By a sign consisting of the outline of a telephone handset with 
the long axis placed horizontally and a vertical three-legged lightning 
slash superimposed over the handset. The slash shall be as long 
vertically as the handset is wide horizontally and normally not less 
than 27 inches and no more than 36 inches long. The preferred calling 
channel should be shown in the lower left quadrant and the preferred 
working channel should be shown in the lower right quadrant.

    Note: It is recommended that the radiotelephone sign be similar in 
design to the Service Signs established by the Federal Highway 
Administration (FHWA) in U.S. Road Symbol Signs using Reflective Blue 
and Reflective White colors. Color and design information is available 
from the District Commander of the Coast Guard District in which the 
bridge is located.

[CGD 84-022, 51 FR 16308, May 2, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 117.31  Operation of draw for emergency situations.

    (a) When a drawtender is informed by a reliable source that an 
emergency vehicle is due to cross the draw, the drawtender shall take 
all reasonable measures to have the draw closed at the time the 
emergency vehicle arrives at the bridge.
    (b) When a drawtender receives notice, or a proper signal as 
provided in Sec. 117.15 of this part, the drawtender shall take all 
reasonable measures to have the draw opened, regardless of the operating 
schedule of the draw, for passage of the following, provided this 
opening does not conflict with local emergency management procedures 
which have been approved by the cognizant Coast Guard Captain of the 
Port:
    (1) Federal, State, and local government vessels used for public 
safety;
    (2) Vessels in distress where a delay would endanger life or 
property;
    (3) Commercial vessels engaged in rescue or emergency salvage 
operations; and
    (4) Vessels seeking shelter from severe weather.

[CGD 91-016, 58 FR 20, Jan. 4, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 117.33  Closure of draw for natural disasters or civil disorders.

    Drawbridges need not open for the passage of vessels during periods 
of natural disasters or civil disorders declared by the appropriate 
authorities unless otherwise provided for in Subpart B or directed to do 
so by the District Commander.


<R05>
Sec. 117.35  Operations during repair or maintenance.

    (a) When operation of the draw must deviate from the regulations in 
this part for scheduled repair or maintenance work, the drawbridge owner 
shall request approval from the District Commander at least 30 days 
before the date of the intended change. The request shall include a 
brief description of the nature of the work to be performed and the 
times and dates of requested changes. The District Commander's decision 
is forwarded to the applicant within five working days of the receipt of 
the request. If the request is denied, the reasons for the denial are 
forwarded with the decision.
    (b) When the draw is rendered inoperative because of damage to the 
structure or when vital, unscheduled repair or maintenance work shall be 
performed without delay, the drawbridge

[[Page 525]]

owner shall immediately notify the District Commander and give the 
reasons why the draw is or should be rendered inoperative and the 
expected date of completion of the repair or maintenance work.
    (c) All repair or maintenance work under this section shall be 
performed with all due speed in order to return the draw to operation as 
soon as possible.
    (d) If the operation of the draw will be affected for periods of 
less than 60 days, the regulations in this part will not be amended. 
Where practicable, the District Commander publishes notice of the 
temporary deviations from the regulations in this part in the Federal 
Register and Local Notices to Mariners. If operation of the draw is 
expected to be affected for more than 60 days, the District Commander 
publishes temporary regulations covering the repair period.


<R05>
Sec. 117.37  Opening or closure of draw for public interest concerns.

    (a) For reasons of public health or safety or for public functions, 
such as street parades and marine regattas, the District Commander may 
authorize the opening or closure of a drawbridge for a specified period 
of time.
    (b) Requests for opening or closure of a draw shall be submitted to 
the District Commander at least 30 days before the proposed opening or 
closure and include a brief description of the proposed event or other 
reason for the request, the reason why the opening or closure is 
required, and the times and dates of the period the draw is to remain 
open or closed.
    (c) Approval by the District Commander depends on the necessity for 
the opening or closure, the reasonableness of the times and dates, and 
the overall effect on navigation and users of the bridge.


<R05>
Sec. 117.39  Closure of draw due to infrequent use.

    Upon written request by the owner or operator of a drawbridge, the 
District Commander may, after notice in the Federal Register and 
opportunity for public comment, permit the draw to be closed and 
untended due to infrequency of use of the draw by vessels. The District 
Commander may condition approval on the continued maintenance of the 
operating machinery.

<R05>
Sec. 117.123  Arkansas Waterway-Automated Railroad Bridges.

    (a) Across the Arkansas River, the draw of the Cotton Belt Railroad 
(Rob Roy) Bridge, Mile 67.4, is maintained in the closed position and is 
remotely operated. The following signals shall be used:
    (1) The opening signal from the vessel for each of these bridges is 
three short blasts.
    (2) The acknowledging signal is flashing white lights visible 
upstream and downstream. When the operator of the vessel sights the 
acknowledging signal, one prolonged blast shall be sounded.
    (3) This signal is acknowledged by the bridge controller when the 
draw is to open by changing the flashing white lights to continuous 
white lights, and sounding one blast on a horn. When the span is fully 
raised to a maximum clearance of 52 feet, the navigation lights at mid 
channel change from red to green, indicating that the draw is ready for 
passage.
    (4) If the draw cannot open, flashing amber warning lights are 
flashed and four blasts are sounded, indicating that a train is 
approaching or that maintenance work is in progress.
    (5) The vessel shall acknowledge that there is a delay by sounding 
four short blasts.

[[Page 528]]

    (6) When the draw opens (after the train crosses or when maintenance 
work permits), the amber lights are turned off, the continuous white 
lights turned on, and one blast sounded, to indicate the draw is ready 
for passage.
    (7) The vessel acknowledges with one blast and, after the draw is 
fully open, may proceed through the draw.
    (8) When the vessel clears the draw, the mid channel navigation 
light changes from green to red, the amber warning lights will flash, 
and, after one minute, the draw lowers and locks.
    (b) The draws of the Junction Railroad Bridge at mile 118.7 and the 
Baring Cross Railroad Bridge at mile 119.6, Arkansas River, at Little 
Rock, are maintained in the closed position and are remotely operated. 
The draw of the Rock Island Railroad Bridge at mile 118.2, Arkansas 
River, at Little Rock, is maintained in the open position. Use the 
following procedures to request opening of these bridges when necessary 
for transit;
    (1) Normal Flow Procedures. Any upbound or downbound vessel which 
requires opening the draw of any of these bridges shall establish 
contact by radiotelephone with the remote drawbridge operator on VHF-FM 
Channel 13 in North Little Rock, Arkansas. The remote drawbridge 
operator will advise the vessel whether the requested span can be 
immediately opened and maintain constant contact with the vessel until 
the requested span has opened and the vessel passage has been completed. 
If any or all of the drawbridges cannot be opened immediately, the 
remote drawbridge operator will notify the calling vessel and provide an 
estimated time for individual drawbridge openings.
    (2) High Velocity Flow Procedures. The area from mile 118.2 to mile 
125.4 is a regulated navigation area (RNA) as described in 33 CFR 
165.817. During periods of high velocity flow, which is defined as a 
flow rate of 70,000 cubic feet per second or greater at the Murray Lock 
and Dam, mile 125.4, downbound vessels which require that the draw of 
these three bridges be opened for unimpeded passage shall contact the 
remote drawbridge operator on VHF-FM Channel 13 either before departing 
Murray Lock and Dam, or before departing the mooring cells at Mile 121.5 
to ensure that the Rock Island, Junction, and Baring Cross Railroad 
drawbridges are opened. The remote drawbridge operator shall immediately 
respond to the vessel's call, ensure that all three drawbridges are open 
for pasage, and ensure that they remain in the open positon until the 
downbound vessel has passed through each drawbridge. If a closed 
drawbridge cannot be opened immediately for unimpeded passage in 
accordance with 33 CFR 163.203, the remote drawbridge operator will 
immediately notify the downbound vessel and provide an estimated time 
for drawbridge openings. Upbound vessels shall request openings in 
accordance with the normal flow procedures as set forth above. The 
remote drawbridge operator shall keep all approaching vessels informed 
of the position of the drawbridge spans.
    (c) The draw of the Arkansas Missouri Railroad Bridge, Mile 300.8 
Arkansas River at Van Buren, and the Missouri Pacific Railroad 
Drawbridge, Mile 7.5 Arkansas Waterway at Benzal, are maintained in the 
open position with a minimum vertical clearance of 52 feet except as 
follows:
    (1) When a train approaches either bridge, amber lights attached to 
the bridge begin to flash and an audible signal on the bridge sounds. At 
the end of 10 minutes, the amber light continues to flash; however, the 
audible signal stops and the draw lowers and locks if the photoelectric 
boat detection system detects no obstruction under the span. If there is 
an obstruction, the draw opens to its full height until obstruction is 
cleared.
    (2) After the train clears the bridge, the draw opens to its full 
height, the amber flashing light stops, and the mid channel lights 
change from red to green, indicating the navigation channel is open for 
the passage of vessels.

    (2) When a vessel is approaching and the draw is in the open 
position, contact shall be established by radiotelephone with the remote 
operator to assure that the draw remains open until passage is complete.
    (3) When a vessel is approaching and the draw is in the closed 
position, contact shall be established by radiotelephone with the remote 
operator. If the draw cannot be opened immediately, alternate flashing 
red lights are displayed. If the draw can be opened immediately, 
flashing amber lights are displayed.
    (4) When a train approaches the bridge and the draw is in the open 
position, the operator shall activate alternate flashing red lights on 
top of the draw, sound four short blasts, and scan the river on radar to 
determine whether any vessel is approaching the bridge. The remote 
operator shall also broadcast that the draw is closing. If a vessel or 
vessels are approaching the bridge within one mile, as determined by 
radar scanning, response to radio broadcast, or electronic detector, the 
flashing red lights shall be changed to flashing amber and the operator 
shall keep the draw in the fully open position until the vessel or 
vessels have cleared the bridge. If no vessel is approaching the bridge 
or is beneath the draw, the draw may be lowered and locked in place.
    (5) After the train has cleared the bridge, the draw shall be raised 
to its full height and locked in place, the red flashing lights stopped, 
and the draw lights changed from red to green.
    (b) The draw of the Union Pacific railroad bridge, Mile 151.2, at 
Pekin, Illinois, is operated by a remote operator located at the Union 
Pacific offices in Chicago, Illinois, as follows:
    (1) The draw is normally maintained in the fully open position, 
displaying green mid-channel lights to indicate that the span is fully 
open.
    (2) The draw is equipped with the following:
    (i) A radiotelephone link direct to the remote operator;
    (ii) A horn for sound signals;
    (iii) Eight high intensity amber warning lights, oriented upstream 
and downstream, with two secured to the uppermost chord and two secured 
to the lowermost chord of the drawspan;
    (iv) A radar antenna on the lower portion of the drawspan capable of 
scanning one mile upstream and one mile downstream; and
    (v) Infrared scanners located on the upstream and downstream ends of 
the channel span piers, to detect vessels or other obstructions under 
the bridge.
    (3) The remote operator shall maintain a radiotelephone watch for 
mariners to establish contact as they approach the bridge to ensure that 
the draw is open or that it remains open until passage is complete.
    (4) When a train approaches the bridge and the draw is in the open 
position, the remote operator initiates a ten minute warning period 
before closing the bridge. During this warning period, the amber lights 
begin flashing and a signal of four short blasts sounds on a horn. The 
four-blast signal will repeat after a five second interval. A 
synthesized-voice message is broadcast over the radiotelephone as 
follows: ``The Union Pacific railroad bridge at Mile 151.2, Illinois 
River, will close to navigation in ten minutes.'' The announcement is 
repeated every two minutes, counting down the time remaining until 
closure.
    (5) At the end of the ten minute warning period, the remote bridge 
operator scans under the bridge using infrared detectors and the 
upstream and downstream approaches to the bridge using radar to 
determine whether any vessels are under or are approaching the bridge. 
If any vessels are under or are approaching the bridge within one mile 
as determined by infrared or radar scanning or by a radiotelephone 
response, the remote operator shall not close the bridge until the 
vessel or vessels have cleared the bridge.
    (6) If no vessels are under or approaching the bridge, the mid-
channel navigation lights will change from green to red, the horn signal 
of four short blasts will sound, twice, and the radiotelephone message 
will change to: ``The Union Pacific Railroad Bridge at Mile 151.2, 
Illinois River, is closed to navigation.'' The message will repeat

[[Page 554]]

every two minutes and the amber lights will continue to flash until the 
bridge is fully reopened.
    (7) If the infrared scanners detect a vessel or other obstruction 
under the bridge before the drawspan is fully lowered and locked, the 
closing sequence is stopped, automatically, and the drawspan is raised 
to its fully open position until the channel is clear. When obstruction 
has cleared the navigation span, the remote operator confirms that the 
channel is clear, and reinitiates the ten-minute warning cycle.
    (8) After the train has cleared the bridge, the remote operator 
initiates the lift span raising cycle. When the draw is raised to its 
full height and locked in place, the flashing lights stop and the mid-
channel navigation lights change from red to green. The synthesized 
voice announcement broadcasts at two minute intervals for ten minutes 
that the bridge is reopened to navigation.
    (c) The draws of the McDonough Street Bridge, mile 287.3; Jefferson 
Street bridge, mile 287.9; Cass Street bridge, mile 288.1; Jackson 
Street bridge, mile 288.4; and Ruby Street bridge, mile 288.7; all of 
Joliet, shall open on signal, except that they need not open from 7:30 
a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and from 4:15 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. Monday through 
Saturday.
    (d) The drawspan of the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway bridge, 
mile 290.1 at Lockport, Illinois, is operated by remote operator located 
at the Elgin, Joliet & Eastern offices in East Joliet, Illinois as 
follows:
    (1) The drawspan is normally maintained in the fully open to 
navigation position displaying green center span navigation lights to 
indicate that the drawspan is fully open.
    (2) The bridge is equipped with the following:
    (i) A radiotelephone link direct to the remote operator;
    (ii) A radar antenna on top of the drawspan capable of scanning the 
river, one mile upstream and one mile downstream;
    (iii) Infrared boat detectors under the drawspan, to allow the 
remote bridge operator to detect vessels under the drawspan;
    (iv) Electronic motion detectors under the drawspan to allow the 
remote bridge operator to detect vessel movement under the drawspan;
    (v) A siren for sound signals; and
    (vi) Red and green center span navigation lights.
    (3) The remote bridge operator shall maintain a 24 hour VHF marine 
radio watch for mariners to establish contact as they approach the 
bridge to ensure that the drawspan is open or that it remains open until 
passage of river traffic is complete.
    (4) When rail traffic approaches the bridge, and the drawspan is in 
the open position, the remote bridge operator initiates a one minute 
warning period before closing the drawspan. During this warning period, 
the remote operator shall broadcast at least twice, via marine radio, 
that: ``The drawspan of the EJ&E Railroad bridge will be lowered in one 
minute.'' A siren on the bridge sounds for 20 seconds, to warn anyone on 
or under the bridge that the drawspan will be lowered.
    (5) If a vessel is approaching the bridge upbound or, departing the 
Lockport Lock and Dam at mile 291.1, downbound, with intentions of 
passing through the drawspan, they shall respond to the remote bridge 
operators' marine radio broadcast, or initiate radio contact, indicating 
their proximity to the bridge and requesting an opening of the drawspan 
or that the drawspan remain open until the vessel passes. If any 
approaching vessel is detected or if a radiotelephone response is 
received, the remote operator shall not close the drawspan until the 
vessel or vessels have cleared the bridge.
    (6) At the end of the one minute warning period, if no river traffic 
is approaching or under the drawspan, the remote bridge operator may 
begin lowering the drawspan. Navigation lights located at the center of 
the drawspan change from green to red when the drawspan is not in the 
fully open to navigation position. The drawspan takes approximately 90 
seconds to lower.
    (7) If the presence of a vessel or other obstruction is discovered 
approaching or under the drawspan, during the lowering sequence, before 
the drawspan is fully lowered and locked, the drawspan

[[Page 555]]

shall be stopped and raised to the fully open position. When the vessel 
or obstruction has cleared the drawspan, the remote operator shall 
confirm that the channel is clear and reinitiate the one minute warning 
cycle before lowering the drawspan.
    (8) If no marine traffic is present the drawspan may be lowered and 
seated. When the drawspan is lowered and locked in the closed to 
navigation position, the remote bridge operator periodically broadcasts, 
via marine radio, that: ``The drawspan of the EJ&E Railroad bridge is 
closed to navigation.''
    (9) Failure of the radar system, radio telephone system, infrared 
boat detectors or electronic motion sensors shall prevent lowering the 
drawspan from the remote location.
    (10) when rail traffic has cleared the bridge, the remote bridge 
operator shall raise the drawspan to the fully open to navigation 
position. When the drawspan is raised and in the fully open to 
navigation position, the remote bridge operator broadcasts, at least 
twice, via marine radio, that: ``The drawspan of the EJ&E Railroad 
bridge is open to navigation.'' The center drawspan navigation lights 
change from red to green when the drawspan is fully open to navigation.
    (e) The draws of the McDonough Street Bridge, mile 287.3; Jefferson 
Street Bridge, mile 287.9; Cass Street Bridge, mile 288.1; Jackson 
Street Bridge, mile 288.4; all of Joliet, shall open on signal, except 
that they need not open from 7:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 4 p.m. to 5:30 
p.m. Monday through Saturday. The Ruby Street Bridge shall remain in the 
open to navigation position from March 12, 2003, through 7:30 a.m. on 
July 18, 2003.

Sec. 117.484  Pass Manchac.

    The draw of the Canadian National/Illinois Central Railroad 
automated bridge, mile 6.7, at Manchac, operates as follows:
    (a) The draw is not constantly manned and the bridge will normally 
be maintained in the open position, providing 56 feet vertical clearance 
above mean high tide to the raised tip of the bascule span for one-half 
the channel, and unlimited vertical clearance for the other half.
    (b) Railroad track circuits will detect an approaching train and 
initiate bridge closing warning broadcasts over marine radio and over 
the Public Address (PA) system six (6) minutes in advance of the train's 
arrival. Navigation channel warning lights will be lit, and 
photoelectric (infrared) boat detectors will monitor the waterway 
beneath the bridge for the presence of vessels. The waterway approaches 
to the bridge will be monitored by closed circuit TV (CCTV) cameras.
    (c) Activation of the warning broadcasts also activates a marine 
radio monitor in the Mays Yard (New Orleans switch yard). The yardmaster 
will continuously monitor marine radio broadcasts on the normal and 
emergency marine radio channels throughout the warning period and at all 
times the bridge is closed. The yardmaster will communicate with 
waterway users via the marine radio, if necessary.
    (d) At the end of warning period, if no vessels have been detected 
by the boat detectors, and no interruptions have been performed by the 
yardmaster based on his monitoring of the marine radio and the CCTV, the 
bridge lowering sequence will automatically proceed.
    (e) Upon passage of the train, the bridge will automatically open. 
Railroad track circuits will initiate the automatic bridge opening and 
closing sequences. (Estimated duration that the bridge will remain 
closed for passage of rail traffic is 10 to 12 minutes.) The bridge will 
also be manually operable from two locked trackside control locations 
(key releases) on the approach spans, one on each side of the movable 
span.
    (f) The yardmaster will be provided with a remote EMERGENCY STOP 
button which, if pressed, will stop the bridge operation, interrupt the 
lowering sequence, and immediately return the bridge to the open 
position. The yardmaster will utilize this control feature in the event 
a vessel operator issues an urgent radio call to keep the waterway open 
for immediate passage of the vessel.

Sec. 117.903  Darby Creek.

    (a) The draw of the CONRAIL Railroad Bridge, mile 0.3, at Essington, 
will operate as follows:
    (1) The owner of this bridge on this waterway shall provide and keep 
in good legible condition two board gages painted white with black 
figures, nine inches high to indicate the vertical clearance under the 
closed draw at all stages of the tide. The gages shall be so placed on 
the bridge that they are plainly visible to operators of vessels 
approaching the bridge either up or downstream.
    (2) Trains shall be controlled so that any delay in opening of the 
draw shall not exceed ten minutes except as provided in Sec. 117.31(b). 
However, if a train moving toward the bridge has crossed the home signal 
for the bridge before the signal requesting opening of the bridge is 
given, the train may continue across the bridge and must clear the 
bridge interlocks before stopping.
    (3) From May 15 through October 15, the draw shall be left in the 
open position at all times and will only be lowered for the passage of 
trains and to perform periodic maintenance authorized in accordance with 
subpart A of this part.
    (4) The bridge will be operated by the bridge/train controller at 
the Delair Railroad Bridge in Delair, New Jersey.
    (5) Before the bridge closes for any reason, an on-site crewmember 
will observe the waterway for approaching craft, which will be allowed 
to pass. The on-site crewmember will then communicate with the off-site 
bridge/train controller at the Delair Railroad Bridge either by radio or 
telephone, requesting the off-site bridge/train controller to lower the 
bridge.
    (6) The bridge shall only be lowered from the remote site if the on-
site crewmember's visual inspection shows there are no vessels in the 
area and the infrared channel sensors are not obstructed.
    (7) While the CONRAIL Railroad Bridge is moving from the full open 
to the full closed position, the off-site bridge/train controller will 
maintain constant surveillance of the navigational channel using 
infrared sensors to ensure no conflict with maritime traffic exists. In 
the event of failure or obstruction of the infrared channel sensors, the 
off-site bridge/train controller will stop the bridge and return the 
bridge to the open position. In the event of loss of radio or telephone 
communications with the on-site crewmember, the off-site bridge/train 
controller will stop the bridge and the bridge return to the open 
position.
    (8) When the draw cannot be operated from the remote site, a bridge 
tender must be called to operate the bridge in the traditional on-site 
manner.
    (9) The CONRAIL Railroad channel traffic lights will change from 
flashing green to flashing red anytime the bridge is not in the full 
open position.
    (10) During downward span movement, the channel traffic lights will 
change from flashing green to flashing red, the horn will sound two 
times, followed by a pause, and then two repeat blasts until the bridge 
is seated and locked down.
    (11) When the rail traffic has cleared, the off-site bridge/train 
controller at the Delair Railroad Bridge will sound the horn five times 
to signal the draw of the CONRAIL Railroad Bridge is about to return to 
its full open position.
    (12) During upward span movement, the channel traffic lights will 
change from flashing green to flashing red, the horn will sound two 
times, followed by a pause, and then sound repeat blasts until the 
bridge is in the full open position. In the full open position, the 
channel traffic lights will then turn from flashing red to flashing 
green.
    (13) From October 16 through May 14, the draw shall open on signal 
if at least 24 hours notice is given by telephone at (856) 231-7088 or 
(856) 662-8201. Operational information will be provided 24 hours a day

Sec. 117.1035  Columbia River.

    (a) The term drawtender, as used in this section means the operator 
of the drawspan, whether that person may be a train crew member, 
maintenance person, or an officially designated drawtender.
    (b) The draw of the semi-automated Union Pacific railroad bridge 
(Kalan Bridge), mile 323.4, near Kennewick, Washington, is normally 
maintained in the fully open position with no drawtender in attendance. 
A radar beacon (RACON) is located at the center of the drawspan. The 
RACON operates only when the drawspan is fully open,

[[Page 617]]

by responding with the Morse letter ``K'' to X-band radar signals. When 
necessary to close the drawspan for the passage of a train or for 
maintenance, a drawtender shall be dispatched to operate the draw from 
either of the remote control stations located at the ends of the bridge. 
Operation of the bridge shall be as follows:
    (1) The drawtender shall broadcast a radio message over Channel 16-
VHF to all vessels in the vicinity that the Kalan Bridge will be closing 
in two minutes. If after two minutes no response is received, the 
drawtender shall broadcast a message over Channel 13-VHF that the Kalan 
Bridge is closing. Both messages shall be broadcast twice.
    (2) Prior to activating the closing sequence the drawtender shall 
visually inspect the waterway for marine traffic approaching the bridge. 
The closing sequence shall not be activated until after marine traffic 
has cleared the bridge.
    (3) When the closing sequence is activated, the following functions 
occur automatically: The RACON is deactivated, red strobe lights on the 
lift towers and on the channel piers start flashing, a downward pointing 
arrow consisting of amber colored lights is displayed from the center of 
the drawspan and a recorded message is broadcast over Channel 13-VHF 
advising that the Kalan Bridge is closed to river traffic. The radio 
message is repeated every five minutes, the red lights continue to flash 
and the downward pointing arrow is displayed, until the lift span 
returns to the up and locked position. At the end of the ten minutes, a 
horn sounds for 30 seconds, the span begins closing and the centerspan 
navigation lights turn from green to red. The horn sounds for 30 seconds 
at 10 minute intervals, until the lift span returns to the up and locked 
position.
    (4) If for any reason during the closing sequence a danger is posed 
to marine traffic, the closing sequence shall be stopped and the bridge 
reopened until the threat of danger has passed.
    (5) If the bridge is to be temporarily closed for maintenance or for 
purposes other than the passage of a train, the drawtender shall 
continually monitor Channels 13 and 16 for calls from approaching 
vessels, and respond to inquiries from vessels about the closure.
    (6) After a train has cleared the bridge, the following functions 
occur automatically: The drawspan returns to the fully open and locked 
position, the RACON is reactivated, the arrow display and the red strobe 
lights are extinguished, the red centerspan navigation lights return to 
green and a recorded message is broadcast over Channel 13-VHF that the 
Kalan Bridge is open for marine traffic.
    (7) Bridge status information may be obtained by calling the 
commercial telephone number posted at the drawspan of the bridge.
    (c) The draw of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad bridge at 
mile 328.0, between Pasco and Kennewick, shall open on signal from 8 
a.m. to 4 p.m. At all other times the draw shall open on signal if at 
least 2 hour's notice is given through the General Yardmaster, Pasco, 
Washington.

Sec. 118.65  Lights on fixed bridges.

    (a) Each fixed bridge span over a navigable channel shall be lighted 
so that the center of the navigable channel under each span will be 
marked by a range of two green lights, and each margin of each navigable 
channel will be marked by a red light: Provided, That when a margin of a 
channel is limited by a pier, only those lights prescribed in paragraph 
(b) of this section shall be required to mark such channel margin. The 
green lights shall each show through a horizontal arc of 360 deg.; they 
shall be securely mounted just below the outermost edge of the bridge 
span structure so as to be visible from an approaching vessel. Each red 
light shall show through a horizontal arc of 180 deg., and shall be 
securely mounted just below the outermost edge of the bridge span 
structure to show 90 deg. on either side of a line parallel to the axis 
of the channel so as to be visible from an approaching vessel.

    Note: Until such time that major repairs to or replacements of 
existing fixed span navigation lights colored green are made, it is 
permitted that only one of these lights marking the centerline of the 
same channel under a span shall be visible to an approaching vessel. 
When major repairs to or replacement of such existing green lights are 
made they shall conform with this paragraph.

    (b) Pier lights. When the navigable channel extends from pier to 
pier or when piers are located within the navigable channel, each end of 
such piers shall be lighted with a red light. Each such light shall show 
through a horizontal arc of 180 deg., and shall be securely fastened at 
the end of the pier as low as practicable but not lower than 2 feet 
above navigable high water to show 90 deg. on either side of a line

Except as specified in Sec. 117.47(b) of this chapter for certain 
drawbridges, clearance gauges must meet the requirements of this 
section.
    (b) Clearance gauges must indicate the vertical distance between 
``low steel'' of the bridge channel span and the level of the water, 
measured to the bottom of the foot marks, read from top to bottom. Each 
gauge must be installed on the end of the right channel pier or pier 
protection structure facing approaching vessels and extend to a 
reasonable height above high water so as to be meaningful to the viewer. 
Other or additional locations may be prescribed by the District 
Commander if particular conditions or circumstances warrant.
    (c) Construction. Each gauge must be premanently fixed to the bridge 
pier or

[[Page 639]]

pier protection structure and made of a durable material of sufficient 
strength to provide resistence to weather, tide, and current. Gauges may 
be painted directly on the bridge channel pier or pier protection 
structure if the surface is suitable and has sufficient width to 
accommodate the foot marks (graduations) and numerals.
    (d) Numerals. (1) Each gauge must be marked by black numerals and 
foot marks on a white background. Paint, if used, must be of good 
exterior quality, resistant to excessive chalking or bleeding. 
Manufactured numerals and background material may be used.
    (2) The size, type, and spacing of numerals must conform to the 
Standard Alphabets for Highway Signs and the following table. The 
nominal day visibility distance is the distance at which the clearance 
information needs to be ascertained by approaching vessel operators. The 
District Commander determines this distance for each bridge.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) The length of the foot marks must be no less than the width of a 
single numeral used (except numerals 1 and 4), be the same thickness as 
the width of stroke of the numeral, and extend to the nearest margin of 
the white background. Foot marks must be spaced every foot for nominal 
day visibility of less than 500 feet, every two feet for a nominal day 
visibility of more than 500 feet but less than 1,000 feet, and every 
five feet for nominal day visibility of more than 1,000 feet.
    (4) Intermediate foot marks may be used when more precise 
determination of actual clearance is necessary. Such intermediate foot 
marks must have a width of stroke one-half the width of the stroke 
required for the numeral and shall be three-quarters as long as the 
primary foot marks.
    (5) The horizontal distance between the numeral and nearest edge of 
the white background shall be no less than one-half the width of a 
single numeral (excepting numerals 1 and 4).
    (6) The minimum width of the white background shall be no less than 
three times the width of a single numeral (excepting numerals 1 and 4) 
plus the widths of each additional numeral (when multiple numerals are 
used plus numeral spacing).
    (e) Maintenance. The owner or operator of the bridge shall maintain 
each gauge in good repair and legible condition. The bridge owner or 
operator is responsible for the accuracy of the gauge and shall 
remeasure the vertical distance of the numerals and foot marks below 
``low steel'' of the bridge whenever the gauge is repainted or the 
structure is repaired.

<R05>
Sec. 120.200  What must my Vessel Security Program cover?

    (a) If this part applies to your passenger vessel, you must 
implement a program for that vessel that--
    (1) Provides for the safety and security of persons and property 
traveling aboard the vessel, against unlawful acts;

<R05>
Sec. 120.220  What must I do to report an unlawful act and related activity?

    (a) Either you or the vessel security officer must report each 
breach of security, unlawful act, or threat of an unlawful act against 
any of your passenger vessels to which this part applies, or against any 
person aboard it, that occurs in a place subject to the jurisdiction of 
the United States. You must report the incident to both the COTP and to 
the local office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Also, if

and respond according to Sec. 120.305.
    (c) The Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center, may direct you to 
amend your Vessel Security Plan if he or she determines that 
implementation of the Plan is not providing effective security. Except

address and will allow you at least 60 days to submit proposed 
amendments.
    (d) If there is an emergency or other circumstance where the COTP 
determines that implementation of the Plan is not providing effective 
security, and the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section are
