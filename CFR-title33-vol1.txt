                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of thegeneral and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by theExecutive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Codeis divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject toFederal regulation. 
Each title is divided into chapters which usuallybear the name of the 
issuing agency. Each chapter is furthersubdivided into parts covering 
specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendaryear 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of eachvolume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register arerequired to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code ofFederal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of theoriginal documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code ofFederal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of theFederal Register. These two publications must be used 
together todetermine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since 
itsrevision date (in this case, July 1, 2008), consult the ``Listof CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, andthe ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appearsin the Reader Aids section of the 
daily Federal Register. These twolists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latestamendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Codecontains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the lastrevision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for theregulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of theFederal Register and date of publication. Publication dates 
andeffective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised 
bythe user in determining the actual effective date. In instances 
wherethe effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note 
hasbeen inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those 
instanceswhere a regulation published in the Federal Register states a 
datecertain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted 
followingthe text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980(Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal 
agencies to display an OMBcontrol number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Manyagencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers 
asamendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers 
areplaced as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping 
orreporting requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsoletebefore the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are notcarried. Code users may find the text of 
provisions in effect on agiven date in the past by using the appropriate 
numerical list ofsections affected. For the period before January 1, 
1986, consulteither the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-1963,1964-
1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separatevolumes. For the period 
beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List ofCFR Sections Affected'' is 
published at the end of each CFRvolume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation byreference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statuteand allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publishregulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials alreadypublished elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director ofthe Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect ofincorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if itwere published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
Thismaterial, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
oflaw.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director ofthe 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference onlywhen the 
requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elementson which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume 
ofmaterial published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the 
extentnecessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the 
administrativeprocess.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted 
forpublication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume 
arelisted in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot befound? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy ofmaterial listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approvedincorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued theregulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting theagency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify theDirector of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and RecordsAdministration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to theCode of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revisedannually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and 
Finding Aids.This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities andAgency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts andan alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
alsoincluded in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--ThePresident'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form.This 
index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents''entries in the 
daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyedto 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

DistrictCommanders and Captains of the Port, while rules of 
widerapplicability are issued by senior Coast Guard officials at 
CoastGuard Headquarters, For both significant rulemaking (defined 
byExecutive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review) and non-
significant rulemaking, other than those areas delegated to 
DistrictCommanders and Captains of the Port, the regulatory process 
beginswhen an office chief with program responsibilities identifies 
apossible need for a new regulation or for changes to an 
existingregulation. The need may arise due to statutory changes, or be 
basedon internal review or public input. Early public involvement 
isstrongly encouraged.
    (b) After a tentative significant regulatory approach isdeveloped, a 
significant regulatory project proposal is submitted tothe Marine Safety 
and Security Council for approval. The proposaldescribes the scope of 
the proposed regulation, alternativesconsidered, and potential cost and 
benefits, including possibleenvironmental impacts. All significant 
regulatory projects requireMarine Safety and Security Council approval.
    (c) Significant rulemaking documents must also be approved by 
theCommandant of the Coast Guard.
    (d) If the project is approved, the necessary documents aredrafted, 
including documents to be published in the FederalRegister. These may

adversecomment is received within the specified period, the Coast Guard 
willpublish a notice in the Federal Register to confirm that therule 
will go into effect as scheduled.
    (e) If the Coast Guard receives a written adverse comment or 
awritten notice of intent to submit an adverse comment, the Coast 
Guardwill publish a notice in the final rule section of the 
FederalRegister to announce withdrawal of the direct final rule. If 
anadverse comment clearly applies to only part of a rule, and it 
ispossible to remove that part without affecting the remaining 
portions,the Coast Guard may adopt as final those parts of the rule on 
which noadverse comment was received. Any part of a rule that is the 
subjectof an adverse comment will be withdrawn. If the Coast Guard 
decides toproceed with a rulemaking following receipt of an adverse 
comment, aseparate Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) will be 
published unlessan exception to the Administrative Procedure Act 
requirements fornotice and comment applies.
    (f) A comment is considered adverse if the comment explains whythe 
rule would be inappropriate, including a challenge to the 
rule'sunderlying

Sec. 2.5  Specific definitions control.

    In cases where a particular statute, regulation, policy orprocedure 
provides a specific jurisdictional definition that differsfrom the 
definitions contained in this part, the former definitioncontrols.

    Note to Sec. 2.5: For example, the definition of``inland waters'' 
in the Inland Navigational Rules Act of1980 (33 U.S.C. 2003(o)) would 
control the interpretation of inland

[[Page 31]]

navigation rules created under that Act and the ``inlandwaters'' 
definition in 46 CFR 10.103 would control regulationsin 46 CFR part 10. 
Also, in various laws administered and enforced bythe Coast Guard, the 
terms ``State'' and ``UnitedStates'' are defined to include some or all 
of the territoriesand possessions of the United States. The definitions 
inSec. Sec. 2.36 and 2.38 should be considered assupplementary to these 
statutory definitions and not as interpretiveof them.

<R05>
Sec. 3.01-1  General description.

    (a) The Coast Guard's general organization for the performance ofits 
assigned functions and duties consists of the Commandant, assistedby the 
Headquarters staff, two Area Offices to act as intermediateechelons of 
operational command, and District and Sector Offices toprovide regional 
direction and coordination. Area, District, andSector offices operate 
within defined geographical areas of the UnitedStates, its territories, 
and possessions, including portions of thehigh seas adjacent thereto. 
They are established by the Commandant andtheir areas of responsibility 
are described in this part.
    (b) The two Coast Guard Areas are the Atlantic Area and thePacific 
Area. A Coast Guard Area Commander is in command of a CoastGuard Area. 
The Atlantic Area Office is collocated with the FifthCoast Guard 
District Office. The Pacific Area Office is collocatedwith the Eleventh 
Coast Guard District Office. Area Commanders areresponsible for 
determining when operational matters require thecoordination of forces 
and facilities of more than one district.
    (c) A Coast Guard District Commander is in command of a CoastGuard 
District and the District Commander's office may be referred toas a 
Coast Guard District Office. The District Commander's duties 
aredescribed in Sec. 1.01-1 of this subchapter.
    (d)(1) A Coast Guard Sector Commander is in command of a CoastGuard 
Sector and the Sector Commander's office is referred to as aCoast Guard 
Sector Office. The Sector Commander is responsible for allCoast Guard 
missions within the sector's area of responsibility. TheSector 
Commander's authorities include Search and Rescue MissionCoordinator, 
Federal Maritime Security Coordinator, Federal On-SceneCoordinator, and, 
in most Sectors, Officer in Charge Marine Inspection(OCMI) and Captain 
of the Port (COTP). In his or her capacities asOCMI and COTP, the Sector 
Commander is responsible for a MarineInspection Zone and COTP Zone.
    (2) In some Sectors, a Marine Safety Unit (MSU) retains OCMI andCOTP 
authority over a designated portion of the Sector's area 
ofresponsibility. In such cases, OCMI and COTP authority is exercised 
bythe MSU Commander, not the Sector Commander. The appeal of a COTPorder 
or OCMI matter is routed from the MSU Commander through theSector 
Commander and then to the District Commander.
    (e) An OCMI is in command of a Marine Inspection Zone and his orher 
office may be referred to as a Coast Guard Marine InspectionOffice. The 
OCMI's duties are described inSec. 1.01-20 of this subchapter.
    (f) A COTP is in command of a COTP Zone and his or her office maybe 
referred to as a COTP Office. The COTP's duties are described inSec. 
1.01-30 of this subchapter.
    (g) Each COTP Zone and each Marine Inspection Zone described inthis 
part also includes the United States territorial seas adjacent tothe 
described area or zone for the purpose of enforcing or actingpursuant to 
a statute effective in the United States territorial seas.Each COTP Zone 
and each Marine Inspection Zone described in this partalso includes the 
contiguous zone adjacent to the area or zone for thepurpose of enforcing 
or acting pursuant to a statute effective in thecontiguous zone, as 
defined in Sec. 2.28 of this subchapter.Each COTP Zone and each Marine 
Inspection Zone described in this partalso includes the exclusive 
economic zone (EEZ) adjacent to the areafor the purpose of enforcing or 
acting pursuant to a statute effectivein the EEZ, as defined in Sec. 
2.30 of this subchapter.
    (h) Geographic descriptions used in this part are based 
uponboundaries and points located using the WGS 1984 world grid 
system.When referenced, the outermost extent of the U.S. EEZ is the line 
ofdemarcation produced by the National Oceanic and 
AtmosphericAdministration (NOAA) using the NAD 1983 coordinate system 
andprojected to the WGS 1984 grid system. Both coordinate systems 
aregeocentric and similar such that they are Global Positioning 
System(GPS) compatible throughout the area of concern. Resolution is 
basedupon ddmmss readings to tenths of a second. This corresponds to 
apositional precision of about <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2

[[Page 36]]

meters. Decimal degreesto 5 decimal places correspond to a positional 
precision of about<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 meter. State boundaries used 
to determine points fordescriptions of jurisdictional limits were based 
upon the NationalTransportation Atlas Database 2003 produced by the 
Bureau ofTransportation Statistics. This data set was produced at a 
scale of1:100,000 and theoretically results in a nationwide 
locationalaccuracy of about <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>50 meters of true 
position.

No factors shall be established which requireautomatic change, or denial 
of change, in a discharge.

[[Page 126]]


<R05>
Sec. 51.6  Propriety standard of review.

    A discharge is deemed to be proper except that:
    (a) A discharge may be improper if an error of fact, law,procedure, 
or discretion was associated with the discharge at the timeof issuance 
which prejudiced the rights of the applicant.
    (b) A discharge may be improper if there has been a change inpolicy 
by the Coast Guard made expressly retroactive to the type ofdischarge 
under consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 51.7  Equity standard of review.

    (a) A discharge is presumed to be equitable and will not bechanged 
under this section unless the applicant submits evidencesufficient to 
establish, to the satisfaction of the DRB that:
    (1) The policies and procedures under which the applicant 
wasdischarged differ in material respects from policies and 
procedurescurrently applicable on a service-wide basis to discharges of 
thattype, provided that current policies or procedures represent 
asubstantial enhancement of the rights afforded a party in 
suchproceedings, and there is substantial doubt that the applicant 
wouldhave received the same discharge if relevant current policies 
andprocedures had been available to the applicant at the time of 
thedischarge proceedings under consideration; or
    (2) At the time of issuance, the discharge was inconsistent 
withstandards of discipline in the Coast Guard; or
    (3) The applicant's military record and other evidence presentedto 
the DRB, viewed in conjunction with the factors listed inSec. 51.8 and 
the regulations under which the applicant wasdischarged, do not fairly 
justify the type of discharge received.
    (b) If the applicant was discharged with a characterized 
dischargebefore June 15, 1983, a change from the characterized discharge 
to anuncharacterized discharge will not be considered under the 
provisionsof (a)(1) of this section unless specifically requested by 
theapplicant. A determination that a discharge is inequitable 
accordingto the provisions of (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section shall 
entitlethe applicant to a discharge of a type to which the applicant 
wasentitled at the time the original discharge was issued.

                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 62.1  Purpose.

    (a) The Coast Guard administers the U.S. Aids to NavigationSystem. 
The system consists of Federal aids to navigation operated bythe Coast 
Guard, aids to navigation operated by the other armedservices, and 
private aids to navigation operated by other persons.
    (b)(1) This part describes the general characteristics of the 
U.S.Aids to Navigation System, and the details, policies and 
proceduresemployed by the Coast Guard in establishing, maintaining, 
operating,changing or discontinuing Federal aids to navigation. 
Regulationsconcerning the marking of wrecks, structures, and other 
obstructionsare found in 33 CFR part 64. Regulations concerning private 
aids arefound in 33 CFR part 66. Regulations concerning the marking 
ofartificial islands and structures which are erected on or over 
theseabed and subsoil of the Outer Continental Shelf of the United 
Statesor its possessions are found in 33 CFR part 67. Regulations 
concerningthe marking of bridges are found in 33 CFR part 118. 
Regulationsconcerning aids to navigation at deepwater ports are found 
insubchapter NN of this chapter.
    (2) The regulations found in 33 CFR subpart 66.10 expire onDecember 
31, 2003, at which time the provisions of this part willapply.
    (c) The Coast Guard maintains systems of marine aids to 
navigationconsisting of visual, audible, and electronic signals which 
aredesigned to assist the prudent mariner in the process of 
navigation.The aids to navigation system is not intended to identify 
every shoalor obstruction to navigation which exists in the navigable 
waters ofthe United States, but rather provides for reasonable marking 
ofmarine features as resources permit. The primary objective of the 
aidsto navigation system is to mark navigable channels and 
waterways,obstructions adjacent to these waterways, and obstructions in 
areas ofgeneral navigation which may not be anticipated. Other waters, 
even ifnavigable, are generally not marked.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended byUSCG-2001-9044, 68 
FR 42601, July 18, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 62.5  Marking of marine parades and regattas.

    (a) The Coast Guard may establish aids to navigation to markmarine 
parades and regattas which are regulated by the Coast Guard forthe 
purpose of protecting life and property, or to assist in theobservance 
and enforcement of special regulations. For marine paradeand regatta 
regulations, see Part 100 of this chapter.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R04>
              Subpart B_The U.S. Aids to Navigation System


<R05>
Sec. 62.21  General.

    (a) The navigable waters of the United States and non-navigableState 
waters after December 31, 2003, are marked to assist navigationusing the 
U.S. Aids to Navigation System, a system consistent with 
theInternational Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) 
MaritimeBuoyage System. The IALA Maritime Buoyage System is followed by 
mostof the world's maritime nations and will improve maritime safety 
byencouraging conformity in buoyage systems worldwide. IALA buoyage 
isdivided into two regions made up of Region A and Region B. 
Allnavigable waters of the United States follow IALA Region B, 
exceptU.S. possessions west of the International Date Line and south of 
10degrees north latitude, which follow IALA Region A. Lateral aids 
tonavigation in Region A vary from those described throughout 
thisSubpart. Non-lateral aids to navigation are the same as those used 
inRegion B. See Sec. 62.25. Appropriate nautical charts andpublications 
should be consulted to determine whether the Region A orRegion B marking 
schemes are in effect for a given area.
    (b) The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is designed for use 
withnautical charts. Nautical charts portray the physical features of 
themarine environment, including soundings and other submarine 
features,landmarks, and other aids necessary for the proper navigation 
of avessel. This crucial information cannot be obtained from 
othersources, even ones such as topographic maps, aeronautical charts, 
oratlases. The exact meaning of an aid to navigation may not be clear 
tothe mariner unless the appropriate chart is consulted, as the 
chartillustrates the relationship of the individual aid to navigation 
tochannel limits, obstructions, hazards to navigation, and to the 
totalaids to navigation system.
    (c) The navigator should maintain and consult suitablepublications 
and instruments for navigation depending on the vessel'srequirements. 
This shipboard equipment is separate from the aids tonavigation system, 
but is often

[[Page 148]]

essential to its use. Thefollowing publications are available from the 
U.S. Government toassist the navigator:
    (1) The Light List, published by the Coast Guard and 
availablethrough the Government Printing Office or authorized sales 
agents,lists federal and private aids to navigation. It includes all 
majorFederal aids to navigation and those private aids to navigation, 
whichhave been deemed to be important to general navigation, and 
includes aphysical description of these aids and their locations.
    (2) The United States Coast Pilot, published by the National 
OceanService and available through that agency or authorized nautical 
chartsales agents, supplements the information shown on nautical 
charts.Subjects such as local navigation regulations, channel and 
anchoragepeculiarities, dangers, climatalogical data, routes, and 
portfacilities are covered.
    (3) Local Notices to Mariners are published by local Coast 
GuardDistrict Commanders. Persons may be placed on the mailing list 
toreceive local Notices by contacting the Aids to Navigation andWaterway 
Management Branch of the appropriate Coast Guard District.These notices 
pass information affecting navigation safety. Changes toaids to 
navigation, reported dangers, scheduled construction or 
otherdisruptions, chart corrections and similar useful marine 
informationis made available through this publication.
    (4) The Notice to Mariners is a national publication, similar tothe 
Local Notice to Mariners, published by the National Imagery andMapping 
Agency. The notice may be obtained free of charge fromcommercial 
maritime sources and, upon request, to Defense LogisticsAgency, Defense 
Supply Center Richmond, ATTN: JNB, 8000 JeffersonDavis Highway, 
Richmond, VA 23297-5100 or FAX804-279-6510, ATTN: Accounts Manager, RMF. 
A letter ofjustification should be included in the request. This 
publicationprovides ocean going vessels significant information on 
national andinternational navigation and safety.
    (5) The mariner should also listen to Coast Guard BroadcastNotices 
to Mariners. These broadcasts update the Local Notice toMariners with 
more timely information. Mariners should monitor VHF-FMchannel 16 to 
locate Coast Guard Marine Information Broadcasts.
    (d) The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is primarily a lateralsystem 
which employs a simple arrangement of colors, shapes, numbers,and light 
characteristics to mark the limits of navigable routes. Thislateral 
system is supplemented by nonlateral aids to navigation 
whereappropriate.
    (e) Generally, lateral aids to navigation indicate on which sideof a 
vessel an aid to navigation should be passed when the vessel 
isproceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. Normally, 
theConventional Direction of Buoyage is the direction in which a 
vesselenters navigable channels from seaward and proceeds towards the 
headof navigation. In the absence of a route leading from seaward, 
theConventional Direction of Buoyage generally follows a 
clockwisedirection around land masses. For example, proceeding southerly 
alongthe Atlantic Coast, from Florida to Texas along the Gulf Coast, 
andnortherly along the Pacific Coast are considered as proceeding in 
theConventional Direction of Buoyage. In some instances, this 
directionmust be arbitrarily assigned. Where doubt exists, the mariner 
shouldconsult charts and other nautical publications.
    (f) Although aids to navigation are maintained to a reasonabledegree 
of reliability, the rigors of the marine environment andvarious 
equipment failures do cause discrepancies on occasion.
    (g) The Coast Guard makes reasonable efforts to inform thenavigator 
of known discrepancies, and to correct them within areasonable period of 
time, depending upon resources available.Occasionally, a temporary aid 
to navigation, which provides differentbut similar service, is deployed 
until permanent repairs can be madeto the original aid. Notification of 
such temporary changes is madethrough the notice to mariners system.
    (h) Mariners should exercise caution when using private aids 
tonavigation because private aids are often established to serve 
theneeds of specific users rather than general navigation

[[Page 149]]

and theirpurpose may not be obvious to casual users; and, discrepancies 
toprivate aids are often detected, reported, and corrected less 
promptlythan discrepancies to Coast Guard aids to navigation.

Sec. 62.23  Beacons and buoys.

    (a) Aids to navigation are placed on shore or on marine sites 
toassist a navigator to determine his position or safe course. They 
maymark limits of navigable channels, or warn of dangers or 
obstructionsto navigation. The primary components of the U.S. Aids to 
NavigationSystem are beacons and buoys.
    (b) Beacons are aids to navigation structures which arepermanently 
fixed to the earth's surface. They range from largelighthouses to small, 
single-pile structures and may be located onland or in the water. 
Lighted beacons are called lights; unlightedbeacons are called 
daybeacons.
    (1) Beacons exhibit a daymark. For small structures these arecolored 
geometric shapes which make an aid to navigation readilyvisible and 
easily identifiable against background conditions.Generally, the daymark 
conveys to the mariner, during daylight hours,the same significance as 
does the aid's light or reflector at night.The daymark of large 
lighthouses and towers, however, consists of thestructure itself. As a 
result, these daymarks do not infer lateralsignificance.
    (2) Vessels should not pass beacons close aboard due to the dangerof 
collision with rip-rap or structure foundations, or the obstructionor 
danger that the aid marks.
    (c) Buoys are floating aids to navigation used extensivelythroughout 
U.S. waters. They are moored to the seabed by sinkers withchain or other 
moorings of various lengths.
    (1) The daymark of a buoy is the color and shape of the buoy and,if 
so equipped, of the topmark.
    (i) Can buoys have a cylindrical shape.
    (ii) Nun buoys have a tapered, conical shape.
    (iii) Pillar buoys have a wide cylindrical base supporting anarrower 
superstructure. They may be surmounted by colored shapescalled topmarks.
    (iv) Spherical buoys have a round shape.
    (2) Mariners attempting to pass a buoy close aboard risk 
collisionwith a yawing buoy, the buoy's mooring, or with the obstruction 
whichthe buoy marks.
    (3) Mariners should not rely on buoys alone for determining 
theirpositions due to factors limiting their reliability. Prudent 
marinerswill use bearings or angles from beacons or other 
landmarks,soundings, and various methods of electronic navigation. Buoys 
vary inreliability because:
    (i) Buoy positions represented on nautical charts are 
approximatepositions only, due to practical limitations in positioning 
andmaintaining buoys and their sinkers in precise geographical 
locations.
    (ii) Buoy moorings vary in length. The mooring lengths define 
a``watch circle'', and buoys can be expected to move withinthis circle. 
Actual watch circles do not coincide with the dots orcircles 
representing them on charts.
    (iii) Buoy positions are normally verified during 
periodicmaintenance visits. Between visits, environmental 
conditions,including atmospheric and sea conditions, and seabed slope 
andcomposition, may shift buoys off their charted positions. Also 
buoysmay be dragged off station, sunk, or capsized by a collision with 
avessel.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987; CGD86-031, 52 FR 46351, Dec. 5, 
1987]


<R05>
Sec. 62.25  Lateral marks.

    (a) Lateral marks define the port and starboard sides of a routeto 
be followed. They may be either beacons or buoys.
    (b) Sidemarks are lateral marks which advise the mariner to stayto 
one side of the mark. Their most frequent use is to mark the sidesof 
channels; however, they may be used individually to markobstructions 
outside of clearly defined channels. Sidemarks are notalways placed 
directly on a channel edge and may be positioned outsidethe channel as 
indicated on charts and nautical publications.

    (1) Port hand marks indicate the left side of channels 
whenproceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. Beacons 
havegreen square daymarks, while buoys are green can or pillar buoys.
    (2) Starboard hand marks indicate the right side of channels 
whenproceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. Beacons have 
redtriangular daymarks, while buoys are red nun or pillar buoys.
    (c) Preferred channel marks indicate channel junctions 
orbifurcations and may also mark wrecks or obstructions which 
themariner, after consulting a chart to ascertain the location of 
theobstruction relative to the aid, may pass on either side. 
Preferredchannel marks have red and green horizontal bands with the 
color ofthe topmost band indicating the preferred channel. If the 
topmost bandis green, the mark serves as a port hand mark for vessels 
followingthe preferred channel proceeding in the Conventional Direction 
ofBuoyage, and as a starboard hand mark for the other channel. 
Beaconswould have square daymarks, while buoys would be can or pillar 
buoys.If the topmost band is red, the mark serves as a starboard hand 
markfor vessels following the preferred channel proceeding in 
theConventional Direction of Buoyage, and a port hand mark for the 
otherchannel. Beacons would have triangular daymarks, while buoys would 
benun or pillar buoys.
    (d) The above color schemes apply to IALA Region B. Marks locatedin 
the IALA Region A exhibit reversed color significance: port handmarks 
will be red when following the Conventional Direction ofBuoyage, and 
starboard hand marks will be green. The meaning ofdaymark and buoy 
shapes is identical in both regions.
    (e) Certain marks on the Intracoastal Waterway may exhibitreversed 
lateral significance. See Sec. 62.49.

Sec. 62.27  Safe water marks.

    Safe water marks indicate that there is navigable water all 
aroundthe mark. They are often used to indicate fairways or midchannels, 
orthe seaward end of channels. Safe water marks are colored with red 
andwhite vertical stripes. Beacons have an octagonal daymark; red 
andwhite buoys are spherical or display a red spherical topmark.

<R05>
Sec. 62.29  Isolated danger marks.

    Isolated danger marks indicate an isolated danger which may bepassed 
on all sides. As these marks are erected or moored on or neardangers, 
they should not be approached closely without specialcaution. These 
marks are colored black with one or more broadhorizontal red bands and 
are equipped with a topmark of two blackspheres, one above the other.

<R05>
Sec. 62.31  Special marks.

    Special marks are not primarily intended to assist safenavigation, 
but to indicate special areas or features referred to incharts or other 
nautical publications. They may be used, for example,to mark anchorages, 
cable or pipeline areas, traffic separationschemes, military exercise 
zones, ocean data acquisition systems, etc.Special marks are colored 
solid yellow.


<R05>
Sec. 62.32  Inland waters obstruction mark.

    (a) On inland waters designated by the Commandant as State watersin 
accordance with Sec. 66.05-5 of this chapter andon non-navigable 
internal waters of a State which have no defined headof navigation, a 
buoy showing alternate vertical black and whitestripes may be used to 
indicate to a vessel operator that anobstruction to navigation extends 
from the nearest shore to the buoy.
    (b) The black and white buoy's meaning is ``do not passbetween the 
buoy and the shore''. The number of white and blackstripes is 
discretionary, provided that the white stripes are twicethe width of the 
black stripes. Prior to December 31, 2003, this aidshall not be used on 
a waterway which has a red and white stripedobstruction marker

<R05>
Sec. 62.33  Information and regulatory marks.

    (a) Information and Regulatory Marks are used to alert the marinerto 
various warnings or regulatory matters. These marks have orangegeometric 
shapes against a white background. The meanings associatedwith the 
orange shapes are as follows:
    (1) A vertical open-faced diamond signifies danger.
    (2) A vertical diamond shape having a cross centered withinindicates 
that vessels are excluded from the marked area.
    (3) A circular shape indicates that certain operating 
restrictionsare in effect within the marked area.
    (4) A square or rectangular shape will contain directions 
orinstructions lettered within the shape.
    (b) When a buoy is used as an information or regulatory mark itshall 
be white with two horizontal orange bands placed completelyaround the 
buoy circumference. One band shall be near the top of thebuoy body, with 
a second band placed just above the waterline of thebuoy so that both 
bands are clearly visible.

<R05>
Sec. 62.35  Mooring buoys.

    Mooring Buoys are white with a blue horizontal band. Thisdistinctive 
color scheme is recommended to facilitate identificationand to avoid 
confusion with aids to navigation.


<R05>
Sec. 62.37  Lighthouses.

    Lighthouses are prominent beacons of varying size, color, 
andappearance employed to mark headlands, landfalls, harbor 
entrances,channel edges, hazards, and other features. While normally 
identifiedby their distinctive appearance, some lighthouses display 
diamondshaped, checkered daymarks to facilitate recognition.


<R05>
Sec. 62.41  Ranges.

    Ranges are aids to navigation systems employing dual beaconswhich, 
when the structures appear to be in line, assist the mariner 
inmaintaining a safe course. The appropriate nautical chart must 
beconsulted when using ranges to determine whether the range marks 
thecenterline of the navigable channel and also to ascertain what 
sectionof the range may be safety traversed. Ranges are generally, but 
notalways, lighted, and display rectangular daymarks of various colors.

<R05>
Sec. 62.43  Numbers and letters.

    (a) All solid red and solid green aids are numbered, with red 
aidsbearing even numbers and green aids bearing odd numbers. The 
numbersfor each increase in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. 
Numbersare kept in approximately sequence on both sides of the channel 
byomitting numbers where necessary.
    (b) Only sidemarks are numbered. However, aids other than 
thosementioned above may be lettered to assist in their identification, 
orto indicate their purpose. Sidemarks may carry letters in addition 
tonumbers to identify the first aid to navigation in a waterway, or 
whennew aids to navigation are added to channels with previously 
completednumerical sequences. Letters on sidemarks will follow 
alphabeticalorder from seaward and proceeding toward the Conventional 
Direction ofBuoyage and will be added to numbers as suffixes.
    (c) Aids to navigation may be fitted with light-reflectingmaterial 
to increase their visibility in darkness. The colors of thismaterial may 
convey the same significance as the aid except thatletters and numbers 
may be white.
    (d) Exceptions to the provisions of this section will be found onthe 
Western Rivers System. See Sec. 62.51.
    (e) The guidelines for the display of numbers and letters on aidsto 
navigation are identical for both Region A and Region B; red aidsto 
navigation

[[Page 152]]

display even numbers, and green aids display oddnumbers.

48608, Nov. 24, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 62.45  Light characteristics.

    (a) Lights on aids to navigation are differentiated by color 
andrhythm. Lighthouses and range lights may display distinctive 
lightcharacteristics to facilitate recognition. No special 
significanceshould be attached to the color or rhythm of such lights. 
Otherlighted aids to navigation employ light characteristics to 
conveyadditional information.
    (b) When proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage, aidsto 
navigation, if lighted, display light characteristics as follows:
    (1) Green lights mark port (left) sides of channels and locationsof 
wrecks or obstructions which are to be passed by keeping theselights on 
the port (left) hand of a vessel. Green lights are also usedon Preferred 
Channel Marks where the topmost band is green.
    (2) Red lights mark starboard (right) sides of channels andlocations 
of wrecks or obstructions which are to be passed by keepingthese lights 
on the starboard (right) hand of a vessel. Red lights arealso used on 
Preferred Channel Marks where the topmost band is red.
    (3) Certain lights marking the Intracoastal Waterway may 
displayreversed lateral significance. See Sec. 62.49.
    (c) Yellow lights have no lateral significance. Except on theWestern 
Rivers, see Sec. 62.51, white lights have no lateralsignificance. The 
purpose of aids exhibiting white or yellow lightsmay be determined by 
their shape, color, letters or numbers, and thelight rhythm employed.
    (d) Light rhythms, except as noted in Sec. 62.51 for theWestern 
Rivers, are employed as follows:
    (1) Aids with lateral significance display regularly flashing 
orregularly occulting light rhythms. Ordinarily, flashing 
lights(frequency not exceeding 30 flashes per minute) will be used.
    (2) Preferred Channel Marks display a composite group flashinglight 
rhythm (groups of two flashes followed by one flash).
    (3) Safe Water Marks display a white Morse Code ``A''rhythm (short-
long flash).
    (4) Isolated Danger Marks display a white group flashing two.
    (5) Special Marks display yellow lights with fixed or slowflashing 
rhythm preferred.
    (6) Mooring Buoys and Information and Regulatory Marks displaywhite 
lights of various rhythms.
    (7) For situations where lights require a distinct 
cautionarysignificance, as at sharp turns, sudden channel constrictions, 
wrecks,or obstructions, a quick flashing light rhythm (60 flashes per 
minute)may be used.
    (e) Occasionally lights use sectors to mark shoals or warnmariners 
of other dangers. Lights so equipped show one color from mostdirections 
and a different color or colors over definite arcs of thehorizon as 
indicated on the appropriate nautical chart. These sectorsprovide 
approximate bearing information since the observer should notea change 
of color as the boundary between the sectors is crossed. Assector 
bearings are not precise, they should be considered a warningonly and 
not used to determine exact bearing to the light.
    (f) Aids to navigation may be fitted with light-reflectingmaterial 
to increase their visibility in darkness. Green or redreflective 
material is used only on marks which, if lighted, wouldexhibit a light 
of that color. Yellow reflective material is used onspecial marks and on 
Intracoastal Waterway marks. No significance isattached to white 
reflective material.

<R05>
Sec. 62.47  Sound signals.

    (a) Often sound signals are located on or adjacent to aids 
tonavigation. When visual signals are obscured, sound signals 
warnmariners of the proximity of danger.
    (1) Sound signals are distinguished by their tone and 
phasecharacteristics.
    (i) Tones are determined by the devices producing the sound 
(i.e.,diaphones, diaphragm horns, reed horns, sirens, whistles, bells 
andgongs).

[[Page 153]]

    (ii) Phase characteristics are defined by the signal's soundpattern, 
i.e., the number of blasts and silent periods per minute andtheir 
durations. Sound signals emanating from fixed structuresgenerally 
produce a specific number of blasts and silent periods eachminute when 
operating. Buoy sound signals are generally actuated bythe motion of the 
sea and therefore do not emit a regular signalcharacteristic.
    (2) Where no live watch is maintained, sound signals are 
normallyoperated continuously. However, some are equipped with fog 
detectorswhich activate sound signals when visibility falls below 
apredetermined limit.
    (b) Mariners should not rely solely on sound signals to 
determinetheir positions for the following reasons:
    (1) Distance cannot be accurately determined by sound intensity.
    (2) Occasionally sound signals may not be heard in areas close 
totheir location.
    (3) Signals may not sound in cases where fog exists close to, butnot 
at, the location of the sound signal.
    (4) As buoy signals are generally activated by sea motion, theymay 
produce no signals when seas are calm.
    (5) As previously noted, buoy positions are not always 
reliable.Therefore their sound signals cannot be assumed to be emanating 
from afixed position.


<R05>
Sec. 62.49  Intracoastal Waterway identification.

    (a) In addition to the conventional signals, aids to 
navigationmarking the Intracoastal Waterway exhibit unique yellow 
symbols todistinguish them from aids marking other waters.
    (1) Yellow triangles indicate that aids to navigation so 
markedshould be passed keeping them on the starboard (right) hand of 
avessel, regardless of the aid's number, color, or light color.
    (2) Yellow squares indicate that aids to navigation so markedshould 
be passed keeping them on the port (left) hand of a vessel,regardless of 
the aid's number, color, or light color.
    (3) A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral information, 
butsimply identifies aids to navigation as marking the 
IntracoastalWaterway.
    (b) The above guidelines apply for vessels traversing 
theIntracoastal Waterway in a southerly direction on the Atlantic 
Coast,in a westerly direction on the Okeechobee Waterway, or in a 
westerlydirection along the Gulf Coast.

[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987; CGD86-031, 52 FR 46351, Dec. 5,

<R05>
Sec. 62.51  Western Rivers Marking System.

    (a) A variation of the standard U.S. aids to navigation 
systemdescribed above is employed on the Mississippi River and 
tributariesabove Baton Rouge, LA and on certain other rivers which flow 
towardthe Gulf of Mexico.
    (b) The Western Rivers System varies from the standard U.S. systemas 
follows:
    (1) Buoys are not numbered.
    (2) Numbers on beacons do not have odd/even lateral significancebut, 
rather, indicate mileage from a fixed point (normally the rivermouth).
    (3) Diamond-shaped non-lateral dayboards, checkered red-and-whiteor 
green-and-white, similar to those used in the U.S. Aids toNavigation 
System, as appropriate, are used as crossing dayboardswhere the river 
channel crosses from one bank to the other.
    (4) Lights on green buoys and on beacons with green daymarks showa 
single flash which may be green or white.
    (5) Lights on red buoys and on beacons with red daymarks show 
adouble flash [Group Flashing (2)] which may be red or white.
    (6) Isolated danger marks are not used.

<R05>
Sec. 62.53  Racons.

    (a) Aids to navigation may be enhanced by the use of radar 
beacons(racons). Racons, when triggered by a radar signal, will transmit 
acoded reply to the interrogating radar. This reply serves to 
identifythe aid station by exhibiting a series of dots and dashes which 
appearon the radar display in a line emanating radially from just beyond 
theecho of the aid station. Although racons may be used on both 
laterallysignificant and non-laterally significant aids alike, the racon 
signal

[[Page 154]]

itself is for identification purposes only, and therefore carriesno 
lateral significance.
    (b) Racons are also used as bridge marks to mark the best point 
ofpassage.


<R05>
Sec. 62.54  Ownership identification.

    Ownership identification on private or state aids to navigation 
ispermitted so long as it does not change or hinder an understanding 
ofthe meaning of the aid to navigation.

<R04>
     Subpart D_Public Participation in the Aids toNavigation System


<R05>
Sec. 62.63  Recommendations.

    (a) The public may recommend changes to existing aids tonavigation, 
request new aids or the discontinuation of existing aids,and report aids 
no longer necessary for maritime safety. Theserecommendations should be 
sent to the appropriate District Commander.
    (b) Recommendations, requests and reports should be documentedwith 
as much information as possible to justify the proposed action.Desirable 
information includes:
    (1) Nature of the vessels which transit the area(s) in thequestion, 
including type, displacement, draft, and number ofpassengers and crew.
    (2) Where practicable, the kinds of navigating devices used 
aboardsuch vessels (e.g, magnetic or gyro compasses, radio 
directionfinders, radar, loran, and searchlights).
    (3) A chartlet or sketch describing the actual or proposedlocation 
of the aid(s), and a description of the action requested orrecommended.


<R05>
Sec. 62.65  Procedure for reporting defects and discrepancies.

    (a) Mariners should notify the nearest Coast Guard 
facilityimmediately of any observed aids to navigation defects 
ordiscrepancies.
    (b) The Coast Guard cannot monitor the many thousands of aids inthe 
U.S. Aids to Navigation System simultaneously and continuously. Asa 
result, it is not possible to maintain every aid operating properlyand 
on its charted position at all times. Marine safety will beenhanced if 
persons finding aids missing, sunk, capsized, damaged, offstation, or 
showing characteristics other than those advertised in theLight List, or 
other publication, promptly inform the Coast Guard.When making the 
report to the Coast Guard the mariner should consultthe Light List to 
ensure the correct geographical information is useddue to the similarity 
of names and geographical areas.
    (c) Procedures for reporting defects and discrepancies:
    (1) Radio messages should be prefixed ``CoastGuard'' and transmitted 
directly to a Government shore radiostation listed in Chapter three of 
Radio Navigation Aids Publication,117, for relay to the relevant 
District Commander.
    (2) Telephone, e-mail, or facsimile messages may also be used 
toadvise the nearest Coast Guard unit of defects or discrepancies inaids 
to navigation.

Sec. 66.01-11  Lights.

    (a) Except for range and sector lights, each light approved as 
aprivate aid to navigation must:
    (1) Have at least the effective intensity required by this 
subpartomnidirectionally in the horizontal plane, except at the seams of 
itslens-mold.
    (2) Have at least 50% of the effective intensity required by 
thissubpart within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2[deg] of the horizontal plane.
    (3) Have a minimum effective intensity of at least 1 candela for 
arange of

[[Page 159]]

1 nautical mile, 3 candelas for one of 2 nautical miles,10 candelas for 
one of 3 nautical miles, and 54 candelas for one of 5nautical miles. The 
District Commander may change the requirements forminimum intensity to 
account for local environmental conditions. For aflashing light this 
intensity is determined by the following formula:

Ie=G/(0.2+t<INF>2</INF>-t<INF>1</INF>)

Where:

Ie = Effective intensity
G = The integral of the instantaneous intensity of the flashedlight with 
respect to time
t<INF>1</INF> = Time in seconds at the beginning of the flash
t<INF>2</INF> = Time in seconds at the end of the flash
t<INF>2</INF>-t<INF>1</INF> is greater than or equal to0.2 seconds.

    (4) Unless the light is a prefocused lantern, have a means 
ofverifying that the source of the light is at the focal point of 
thelens.
    (5) Emit a color within the angle of 50% effective intensity 
withcolor coordinates lying within the boundaries defined by the 
cornercoordinates in Table 66.01-11(5) of this part when plotted onthe 
Standard Observer Diagram of the International Commission onIllumination

    (a) USWMS aids to navigation may have lateral or cardinal meaning.
    (b) On a well defined channel including a river or otherrelatively 
narrow natural or improved waterway, an aid to navigationshall normally 
be a solid colored buoy. A buoy which marks the leftside of the channel 
viewed looking upstream or toward the head ofnavigation shall be colored 
all black. A buoy which marks the rightside of the channel viewed 
looking upstream or toward the head ofnavigation shall be colored all 
red. On a well defined channel, solid

[[Page 165]]

colored buoys shall be established in pairs, one on each side ofthe 
navigable channel which they mark, and opposite each other toinform the 
user that the channel lies between the buoys and that theuser should 
pass between the buoys.
    (c) On an irregularly defined channel, solid colored buoys may 
beused singly in staggered fashion on alternate sides of the 
channelprovided they are spaced at sufficiently close intervals to 
inform theuser that the channel lies between the buoys and that the user 
shouldpass between the buoys.
    (d) Where there is no well-defined channel or when a body of wateris 
obstructed by objects whose nature or location is such that 
theobstruction can be approached by a vessel from more than 
onedirection, supplemental aids to navigation having cardinal 
meaning(i.e., pertaining to the cardinal points of the compass, north, 
east,south, and west) may be used. The use of an aid to navigation 
havingcardinal meaning is discretionary provided that the use of such 
amarker is limited to wholly State owned waters and the State watersfor 
private aids to navigation as defined and described in this part.
    (e) Aids to navigation conforming to the cardinal system 
shallconsist of three distinctly colored buoys.
    (1) A white buoy with a red top may be used to indicate to avessel 
operator that the operator must pass to the south or west ofthe buoy.
    (2) A white buoy with a black top may be used to indicate to avessel 
operator that the operator must pass to the north or east ofthe buoy.
    (3) In addition, a buoy showing alternate vertical red and 
whitestripes may be used to indicate to a vessel operator that 
anobstruction to navigation extends from the nearest shore to the 
buoyand that the operator must not pass between the buoy and shore. 
Thenumber of white and red stripes is discretionary, provided that 
thewhite stripes are twice the width of the red stripes.

    (a) When will structures be assigned to a Class? TheDistrict 
Commander will assign structures to Class A, B, or C as partof 
processing an application for a permit to establish and operatelights 
and sound signals.
    (b) In general, where will the different classes of structuresbe 
located? Specific criteria in paragraph (c) of this section maycreate 
exceptions, but, in general, structures the farthest from shoreare 
likely to be assigned to Class A and required to have obstructionlights 
and sound signals that can be detected from the farthestdistance. 
Structures closest to shore are likely to be assigned toClass C and, 
while subject to requirements to ensure that they arealso detectable 
from a safe distance away, will be required to havethe least powerful 
obstruction lights or sound signals. The locationand standards for Class 
B structures will generally be in betweenClass A and C structures.
    (c) What criteria will be used to classify structures? Whenassigning 
a structure to a class, the District Commander will takeinto 
consideration whether a line of demarcation has been prescribed,and 
matters concerning, but not necessarily limited to, the dimensionsof the 
structure and the depth of water in which it is located, theproximity of 
the structure to vessel routes, the nature and amount ofvessel traffic, 
and the effect of background lighting.
    (1) If a line of demarcation has been prescribed, the 
DistrictCommander will assign those structures seaward of the line 
ofdemarcation to Class A. He or she will assign all structures 
shorewardof the line of demarcation to either Class B or Class C, unless 
theDistrict Commander determines under Sec. 67.05-25that the structure 
should be assigned to Class A because of thestructure's proximity to a 
navigable channel, fairway or line ofdemarcation.
    (2) If a line of demarcation has not been prescribed, the 
DistrictCommander will assign a structure to Class A, B, or C as he or 
shedeems appropriate.

    (a) Description. See Sec. 3.40-1 of thischapter.
    (b) Lines of demarcation. The two lines of demarcationdescribed in 
this section are for administrative purposes todistinguish between the 
areas in which structures shall be subject toClass ``A'', ``B'' or 
``C''requirements. The primary line of demarcation delimits the areas 
tothe seaward of which Class ``A'' requirements are imposed.The 
secondary line of demarcation delimits the areas to the shorewardof 
which Class ``C'' requirements are imposed. In thoseareas where no 
secondary line of demarcation is prescribed, thestructures shoreward of 
the primary line of demarcation are consideredto be Class ``C'' 
structures. Class ``B''requirements are imposed on the structures in the 
areas between thetwo lines of demarcation.

               SUBCHAPTER D_INTERNATIONAL NAVIGATION RULES

<R05>


<R03>
Special Note_Application of the 72 COLREGS toterritories and possessions.--Table of Contents

<R05>


    a. Article III of the Convention on the International Regulationsfor 
Preventing Collisons at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), done at London,October 
20, 1972, as rectified by Proces-Verbal of December 1, 1973,provides 
that a party may notify the Secretary-General of theInternational 
Maritime Organization (IMO, formerly Inter-GovernmentalMaritime 
Consultative Organization or IMCO) that it extends theapplication of the 
Convention to territory for which it is responsiblefor international 
relations. Since it is the intention of the UnitedStates that the 72 
COLREGS apply to all U.S. territories andpossessions to the same extent 
that the International Regulations forPreventing Collisions at Sea, 1960 
(60 COLREGS) (16 USC 794, TIAS5813) previously applied, the United 
States has given notice to theSecretary-General that the provisions of 
the 1972 COLREGS areapplicable on July 15, 1977, to the following 
territories andpossessions for which the United States is responsible 
forinternational relations:

Puerto Rico
Guam
The Canal Zone
The Virgin Islands of the United States
American Samoa
Midway Island
Wake Island
Johnston Island
Palmyra Island
Kingman Reef
Howland Island
Baker Island
Jarvis Island
Navassa Island

    b. In accordance with Article III, other parties to the 
Conventionhave notified the Secretary-General that application of 72 
COLREGS isextended. These parties with their territorial extensions are 
listedin Table 1.

      Table 1. Territorial Extensions of Other Partiesto 72 COLREGS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                Territories to which
            Party to convention                72COLREGS are extended
------------------------------------------------------------------------
United Kingdom............................  Hong Kong.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Because earlier formulations of the COLREGS were not elaborated 
astreaties, they came into force by the almost simultaneous enactment 
ofdomestic legislation by the majority of maritime nations. The 
COLREGSwere judicially considered as being customary international law, 
thatis to say international law based upon the consensus of 
maritimenations rather than upon an express instrument. Because 72 
COLREGS waselaborated as a treaty, and under usual treaty practice only 
partiesare bound, there may be a period of time after the 72 COLREGS 
comeinto force during which the ships of a nation not party to 72 
COLREGSmight not be considered as being bound to comply with the 
convention.While it is most likely that the 72 COLREGS will rapidly 
achieve thestatus of customary international law, thereby obviating any 
concernon the part of the mariner as to whether a particular nation is 
aparty, it does not necessarily follow that the courts in all 
nationswill apply 72 COLREGS to the vessels of a non-party nation. In 
theabsence of changes in their domestic law there may be certain 
nationsthat will feel compelled to continue 60 COLREGS in force, despite 
thecoming into force of 72 COLREGS.
    The following nations are Contracting Parties for which 72 
COLREGSwill apply upon the Convention's entry into force:

Algeria
Bahamas
Belgium
Brazil
Bulgaria
Canada
Denmark
Finland
France
German Democratic Republic

 Note. The range of audibility in the table above isfor information and is approximately the range at which a
  whistle mayusually be heard on its forward axis in conditions of still air onboard a vessel having average
  background noise level at the listeningposts (taken to be 68 dB in the octave band centered on 250 Hz and 63dB
  in the octave band centered on 500 Hz).
In practice the range at which a whistle may be heard is extremelyvariable and depends critically on weather
  conditions; the valuesgiven can be regarded as typical but under conditions of strong windor high ambient
  noise level at the listening post the range may bemuch reduced.


<R05>
Sec. 86.07  Directional properties.

    The sound pressure level of a directional whistle shall be notmore 
than 4 dB below the sound pressure level specified inSec. 86.05 in any 
direction in the horizontal plane within<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>45 degrees 
of the forward axis. The sound pressure level ofthe whistle in any other 
direction in the horizontal plane shall notbe more than 10 dB less than 
the sound pressure level specified forthe forward axis, so that the 
range of audibility in any directionwill be at least half the range 
required on the forward axis. Thesound pressure level shall be measured 
in that one-third octave bandwhich determines the audibility range.


<R05>
Sec. 86.09  Positioning of whistles.

    (a) When a directional whistle is to be used as the only whistleon 
the vessel and is permanently installed, it shall be installed withits 
forward axis directed forward.

[[Page 231]]

    (b) A whistle shall be placed as high as practicable on avessel, in 
order to reduce interception of the emitted sound byobstructions and 
also to minimize hearing damage risk to personnel.The sound pressure 
level of the vessel's own signal at listening postsshall not exceed 110 
dB(A) and so far as practicable should not exceed100 dB(A).


<R05>
Sec. 86.11  Fitting of more than one whistle.

    If whistles are fitted at a distance apart of more than 100meters, 
they shall not be sounded simultaneously.


<R05>
Sec. 86.13  Combined whistle systems.

    (a) A combined whistle system is a number of whistles (soundemitting 
sources) operated together. For the purposes of the Rules acombined 
whistle system is to be regarded as a single whistle.
    (b) The whistles of a combined system shall:
    (1) Be located at a distance apart of not more than 100 meters,
    (2) Be sounded simultaneously,
    (3) Each have a fundamental frequency different from those of 
theothers by at least 10 Hz, and
    (4) Have a tonal characteristic appropriate for the length ofvessel 
which shall be evidenced by at least two-thirds of the whistlesin the 
combined system having fundamental frequencies falling withinthe limits 
prescribed in Sec. 86.03, or if there are onlytwo whistles in the 
combined system, by the higher fundamentalfrequency falling within the 
limits prescribed inSec. 86.03.

    Note: If due to the presence of obstructions the sound fieldof a 
single whistle or of one of the whistles referred to inSec. 86.11 is 
likely to have a zone of greatly reducedsignal level, a combined whistle 
system should be fitted so as toovercome this reduction.


<R05>
Sec. 86.15  Towing vessel whistles.

    A power-driven vessel normally engaged in pushing ahead or 
towingalongside may, at all times, use a whistle whose characteristic 
fallswithin the limits prescribed by Sec. 86.03 for the 
longestcustomary composite length of the vessel and its tow.

<R05>
Sec. 86.21  Intensity of signal.

    A bell or gong, or other device having similar soundcharacteristics 
shall produce a sound pressure level of not less than110 dB at 1 meter.


<R05>
Sec. 86.23  Construction.

    Bells and gongs shall be made of corrosion-resistant material 
anddesigned to give a clear tone. The diameter of the mouth of the 
bellshall be not less than 300 mm for vessels of more than 20 meters 
inlength, and shall be not less than 200 mm for vessels of 12 to 
20meters in length. The mass of the striker shall be not less than 
3percent of the mass of the bell. The striker shall be capable ofmanual 
operation. Note: When practicable, a power-driven bell strikeris 
recommended to ensure constant force.

    A vessel of special construction or purpose means a vesseldesigned 
or modified to perform a special function and whosearrangement is 
thereby made relatively inflexible.
    Interference with the special function of the vessel occurswhen 
installation or use of lights, shapes, or sound-signalingappliances 
under the Inland Rules prevents or significantly hindersthe operation in 
which the vessel is usually engaged.

Sec. 109.01  Purpose.

    The purpose of the rules and regulations in this subchapter is 
toimplement certain laws and set forth the requirements for 
anchorageareas.

[CGFR 67-46, 32 FR 17727, Dec. 12, 1967, as amended byCGD 79-096, 44 FR

<R05>
Sec. 109.05  Anchorage grounds.

    (a) Section 7 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 4, 1915 
(33U.S.C. 471), authorizes the establishment of anchorage grounds 
forvessels in navigable waters of the United States whenever it 
isapparent that these are required by the maritime or 
commercialinterests of the United States for safe navigation. The 
statute alsoauthorizes the adoption of suitable rules and regulations 
regardingthe establishment of anchorage grounds, which are enforced by 
theCoast Guard. The authority conferred by this statute was 
transferredto and vested in the Secretary of Homeland Security by 
section 902(j)of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006 
(Pub. L.109-241, 120 Stat. 516), and delegated to the Commandant of 
theU.S. Coast Guard in Department of Homeland Security Delegation 
No.0170.1. The Commandant redelegated the authority to 
establishanchorage grounds to each Coast Guard District Commander as 
providedin 33 CFR 1.05-1(e)(1)(i).
    (b) District Commanders will, whenever matters relating to 
theanchorage of vessels are under consideration, ascertain the view 
ofthe District and Division Engineer, Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, 
andthe proper representatives of other departments likely to 
beinterested, including the Commandant of the Naval District 
concernedand the medical officer in charge of the quarantine station 
atlocalities where quarantine anchorages are involved, in order thatthey 
may arrange for suitable representation at such hearings. Theviews of 
the medical officer in charge of the quarantine stationrelating to the 
proposed location and boundaries of the quarantineanchorage will be 
accepted insofar as practicable and consistent withthe establishment of 
other anchorage areas. (An Act of Congressapproved July 1, 1944, as 
amended (42 U.S.C. 267), authorizes theSurgeon General, with the 
approval of the Secretary of Health,Education, and Welfare, to designate 
the boundaries of the quarantinegrounds and quarantine anchorages for 
vessels which are reserved foruse at each United States quarantine 
station.) A notice of publichearing concerning changes to the Anchorage 
Regulations will be issuedby the District Commander and will be mailed 
to all known interestedparties. After providing an opportunity for 
public participation, theDistrict Commander will, if circumstances so 
warrant, issue changes tothe Anchorage Regulations, or in appropriate

Sec. 109.10  Special anchorage areas.

    An Act of Congress of April 22, 1940, provides for the designationof 
special anchorage areas wherein vessels not more than sixty-fivefeet in 
length, when at anchor, will not be required to carry orexhibit 
anchorage lights. Such designation is to be made afterinvestigation, by 
rule, regulation, or order, the procedure for whichwill be similar to 
that followed for anchorage grounds under section 7of the Rivers and 
Harbors Act of March 4, 1915, as referred to inSec. 109.05. The areas 
so designated should be well removedfrom the fairways and located where 
general navigation will notendanger or be endangered by unlighted 
vessels. The authority todesignate special anchorage areas was 
transferred to and vested in theSecretary of Homeland Security by 
section 902(j) of the Coast Guardand Maritime Transportation Act of 2006 
(Pub. L. 109-241, 120Stat 516), and delegated to the Commandant of the 
U.S. Coast Guard inDepartment of Homeland Security Delegation No. 
0170.1. The Commandantredelegated the authority to establish anchorage 
grounds to each CoastGuard District Commander as provided in 33 CFR 
1.05-1(e)(1)(i).

<R05>
Sec. 114.10  General policies on issuance of permits and drawbridge operationregulations.

    The several bridge laws referenced in Sec. 114.01Purpose, are 
intended to prevent any interference with navigablewaters of the United 
States whether by bridges, dams, dikes or otherobstructions to 
navigation except by express permission of the UnitedStates. The 
decision as to whether a bridge permit or a drawbridgeoperation 
regulation will be issued or promulgated must rest primarilyupon the 
effect of the proposed action on navigation to assure thatthe action 
provides for the reasonable needs of navigation after fullconsideration 
of the effect of the proposed action on the humanenvironment. The Coast 
Guard is not responsible for any other permitsthat the applicant may 
need from other federal, state, or localagencies and issuance of a 
bridge permit does not affect flood controlprojects or other 
governmental programs.

<R05>
Sec. 114.20  Departure from permit plans.

    (a) If the final inspection shows a minor departure from 
theauthorized plans which does not materially affect navigation, 
thepermittee will be required to furnish a tracing showing the work 
asactually constructed but no further action will be taken by the 
CoastGuard.
    (b) It is not the practice of the Coast Guard to issue 
letterscertifying that completed work conforms to that which was 
authorized.That question is a matter of fact to be determined in case 
ofcontroversy by the usual rules of court procedure.


<R05>
Sec. 114.25  Work constructed without prior authority.

    The Commandant or District Commander will approve plans and 
issuepermits authorizing bridges across navigable waters, in cases 
wherethe application therefor is submitted after the commencement 
orcompletion of the bridges subject to the following rules: Approvalwill 
be limited to those cases where the necessary primary authority,State or 
Federal as the case may be, validly existed, when the workwas innocently 
constructed, and where the work will not unreasonablyinterfere with 
navigation. Upon issuance of the permit, applicant willbe informed that 
the law contemplates prior approval and that in thefuture plans must be 
submitted in ample time for their considerationby the Commandant or 
District Commander before construction is begun.

Sec. 114.30  Revocation.

    Permits may be revoked by the issuing official for failure on 
thepart of the permittee to comply with any of the conditions therein, 
orwhere the structures or other work constitute an 
unreasonableobstruction to navigation or to operations of the United 
States in theinterest of navigation or flood control.

<R05>
Sec. 114.40  Violations of law.

    The Coast Guard has the authority and responsibility forenforcement 
of the applicable provisions of law for the protection andpreservation 
of navigable waters. It is the policy of the Coast Guardto secure 
compliance with these provisions of law short of legalproceedings. As a 
general principle, no action is taken when theviolation is minor, 
unintentional, or accidental and the partyresponsible corrects the 
violation. It is the policy of the CoastGuard to implement civil or 
criminal proceedings in all othercircumstances.

Sec. 115.01  Purpose.

    This part states the requirements for applying for a permit 
forconstruction of or modification to bridges crossing the 
navigablewaters of the United States. It also sets forth the procedures 
bywhich the application is processed by the Coast Guard.

[CGD 82-006, 47 FR 36641, Aug. 23, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 115.05  Necessary primary authority.

    For bridges constructed by State or municipal agencies, theprimary 
authority will be presumed without proof. If the law of theState 
requires a license for or approval of the bridge from aconstituted State 
agency, a copy of such license or approval will berequired and may be 
accepted as evidence of the primary authority. Ifthere be no State 
regulation of bridges in navigable waters, thenecessary primary 
authority may be that granted in the charter of acorporation, or the 
authority inherent in the ownership of the land onwhich the structure is 
placed. The applicant will in such cases berequired to furnish an 
extract from the charter, or a statement ofownership. Especial care will 
be taken that Federal approval is notgranted when there is doubt of the 
right of the builder to constructand utilize the bridge.


<R05>
Sec. 115.10  Limiting date in permits.

    (a) Specific time limitations are inserted in all permits for 
thecommencement of construction and completion thereof. Normally 
threeyears for start of construction and two additional years 
forcompletion may be allowed.

[[Page 544]]

    (b) Specific time limitations are inserted in all permits forthe 
removal of bridges being replaced in whole or in part by the 
newlypermitted bridges where removal thereof is required as a condition 
ofthe permit. Normally 90 days for removal after completion of the 
newbridge or opening to land transportation, whichever occurs first, 
maybe allowed.

[CGD 75-046, 40 FR 24898, June 11, 1975, as amended byCGD 80-099, 46 FR 
38354, July 27, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 115.15  Permit bonds.

    When compensatory works or the removal of temporary structuresshould 
be required of the permittee, or in other unusual cases whenthere is 
reason to anticipate that the permittee may fail to carry outparts of 
the work that are against his interest, an additionalcondition will be 
included in the permit requiring the permittee tofurnish a bond insuring 
compliance with the permit requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 115.20  Transfer of permits.

    Permits express merely the assent of the Federal Government so faras 
concerns the public rights of navigation. Although issued to aspecific 
party, the assent is not limited to execution of the work bythat party 
and may be availed of by the assignees or purchasers of theproperty 
affected, provided the terms of the instrument are strictlycomplied 
with.


<R05>
Sec. 115.30  Sufficiency of State authority for bridges.

    An opinion of the attorney general of the State as to thesufficiency 
of State authority for the construction of a bridge isacceptable to the 
Coast Guard in doubtful cases.

Sec. 115.40  Bridge repairs.

    Repairs to a bridge which do not alter the clearances, type 
ofstructure, or any integral part of the substructure or 
superstructureor navigation conditions, but which consist only in the 
replacement ofworn or obsolete parts, may, if the bridge is a legally 
approvedstructure, be made as routine maintenance without approval of 
the U.S.Coast Guard.

Sec. 115.60  Procedures for handling applications for bridge constructionpermits.

    The following procedures will be observed in the handling 
ofapplications for permits to construct, modify, or replace bridges 
overnavigable waters.
    (a) District Commander's review of application and plans.When an 
application is received, the District Commander verifies theauthority 
for construction of the bridge, reviews, the application andplans for 
sufficiency, ascertains the views of local authorities andother 
interested parties, and ensures that the application complieswith 
relevant environmental laws, regulations, and orders. If theapplication 
contains any defects that would prevent issuance of apermit (as for 
example, if the proposed bridge provided insufficientclearance), the 
applicant is notified that the permit cannot begranted and given reasons 
for this determination. The applicant maythen request that the 
application be considered by the Commandant. Ifthe applicant makes such 
a request, or if the application is not founddefective, the District 
Commander notifies the public that it has beenreceived and continues its 
processing. A copy of this notificationwill be sent to the state, 
interstate agency or the EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) 
responsible for acting on requests for waterquality certification for 
the project. If the state, interstateagency, or the EPA fails to issue 
or deny the water qualitycertification within 30 days after receiving 
the copy of thisnotification, the requirements for a water quality 
certification arewaived. If the appropriate agency notifies the District 
Commander thatthe applicant has not filed a request for water quality 
certification,or requests additional time to review an application, 
additional timewill be granted.

[[Page 546]]

    (b) Public meeting. (1) Public meetings will be heldwhen there are 
substantial issues concerning the effect that theproposed bridge will 
have on the reasonable needs of navigation.
    (2) Notice of the public meeting will be published in theFederal 
Register. Notice of the meeting is also mailed to State,county, and 
municipal authorities and all other known interestedparties. It is also 
posted at the post office nearest the site andpublic places in the 
vicinity.
    (3) Meetings are public and conducted in an informal manner. 
Adesignated Coast Guard official presides. The submission of 
writtenstatements is invited and encouraged. Anyone desiring to do so 
mayspeak. Statements, written or oral, are not under oath, and cross-
examination is not permitted. No fixed order has been established forthe 
presentation of evidence or argument although proponents aregenerally 
heard first, followed by opponents with full opportunityafforded for 
rebuttals.
    (c) Report and recommendations. After the close of thecomment period 
and any public hearings, a detailed statement offindings, conclusions, 
and recommendations based on all availableinformation (including Coast 
Guard records and experience) isprepared. The following factors may be 
discussed in this report:
    (1) Comparison of proposed bridge with existing bridges over 
thewaterway; attitude of local authorities; summary of objections 
raisedby the public, and District Commander's comments or 
responses;probable effect on navigation, present and prospective.
    (2) Description of the navigation on the waterway past the site 
ofthe proposed bridge, the number and type of vessels, the number 
ofvessel trips, and the principal method of handling traffic, whether 
insingle vessels or in tows.
    (3) Whether the District Commander approves, or recommendsapproval 
of the plans. If they are found objectionable, the reasonsfor this 
finding will be stated. If there are objectionable featuresin the plans 
which may be corrected, the applicant is given anopportunity to revise 
them. If approval is given or recommended, allconditions to which the 
permit should be subject will be stated.
    (d) Action on permit application. (1) The District Commandermay 
issue the permit if authorized underSec. 1.01-60(b) of this chapter; 
otherwise, a reportwith the application shall be submitted to the 
Commandant for finalaction.
    (2) When an application is approved, the issuing official signsthe 
permit and transmits it to the applicant.
    (3) When an application is not approved, the applicant is 
notifiedand provided with reasons for the disapproval, and suggestions 
formodifications that would justify reconsideration, if appropriate.
    (4) If an application is disapproved by the District Commander,the 
applicant may appeal this decision to the Commandant underSec. 114.50 
of this chapter. The Commandant's determinationshall constitute final 
agency action.
    (e) Permit amendments. Applications for amendments topermits will be 
processed in the same manner as permit applications.The District 
Commander may approve amendments to any permits whichthat official is 
authorized to issue underSec. 1.01-60(b) of this chapter. All other 
amendmentsmust be approved by the Commandant.

Sec. 115.70  Advance approval of bridges.

    (a) The General Bridge Act of 1946 requires the approval of 
thelocation and plans of bridges prior to start of construction 
(33U.S.C. 525). The Commandant has given his advance approval to 
thelocation and plans of bridges to be constructed across reaches 
ofwaterways navigable in law, but not actually navigated other than 
bylogs, log rafts, rowboats, canoes and small motorboats. In such 
casesthe clearances provided for high water stages will be 
consideredadequate to meet the reasonable needs of navigation.
    (b) The term ``small motorboats'' shall be interpretedin the light 
of the

<R05>
Sec. 116.01  General.

    (a) All bridges are obstructions to navigation and are toleratedonly 
as long as they serve the needs of land transportation whileallowing for 
the reasonable needs of navigation.
    (b) This part describes the general procedures by which the 
U.S.Coast Guard determines a bridge to be an unreasonable obstruction 
tonavigation and issues an Order to Alter under the authority of 
thefollowing statutes, as appropriate: Section 18 of the Rivers 
andHarbors Appropriations Act of 1899, 33 U.S.C. 502; Section 4 of 
theBridge Act of 1906, 33 U.S.C. 494; or the Truman-Hobbs Act of 1940, 
asamended, 33 U.S.C. 511-524.
    (c) A bridge constructed across a navigable water of the 
UnitedStates shall not unreasonably obstruct the free navigation of 
thewater over which it was constructed, either due to insufficient 
heightor width of the navigation span, or because of difficulty in 
passingthrough the draw opening. If any bridge unreasonably 
obstructsnavigation, the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, will order 
thealteration of that bridge. Alterations may include structural 
changes,replacement, or removal of the bridge.
    (d) Whenever the Coast Guard has good reason to believe that abridge 
across any of the navigable waters of the United States is 
anunreasonable obstruction to navigation, the Coast Guard will 
givenotice to the owner of the bridge and other interested parties, 
andhold a public meeting at which the interested parties will have a 
fullopportunity to be heard and to offer evidence on the question 
ofwhether alterations to the bridge are necessary and, if so, the 
extentof alterations needed.
    (e) If the Coast Guard determines that alterations to a bridge 
arenecessary, the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, will issue to the 
bridgeowner an Order to Alter containing details of the 
alterationsnecessary to render navigation through or under the bridge 
reasonablyfree, easy, and unobstructed.
    (1) In the case of a railroad or publicly owned highway bridge, 
anOrder to Alter is issued to the bridge owner under the provisions 
ofthe Truman-Hobbs Act (33 U.S.C. 511 et seq.). In ordering 
thesealterations, the Coast Guard will give due regard to the 
necessitiesof free and unobstructed navigation and of rail and highway 
traffic.For alterations to bridges governed by the Truman-Hobbs Act, the 
CoastGuard must approve general plans, specifications, and contracts 
forthe alteration project, as well as approving the apportionment of 
thetotal cost of the alterations between the United States and the 
bridgeowner.
    (2) For all other bridges, the Order to Alter will contain 
therequired alterations for the bridge and will prescribe a 
reasonabletime in which to accomplish the required alterations. The

[[Page 548]]

bridgeowner is responsible for the entire cost of the required 
alterations.


<R05>
Sec. 116.05  Complaints.

    Any person, company, or other entity may submit to the 
DistrictCommander of the Coast Guard district in which a bridge over 
anavigable water of the United States is located, a complaint that 
abridge unreasonably obstructs navigation. The complaint must be 
inwriting and include specific details to support the allegation.


<R05>
Sec. 116.10  Preliminary review.

    (a) Upon receipt of a written complaint, the District Commanderwill 
review the complaint to determine if, in the District 
Commander'sopinion, the complaint is justified and whether a 
PreliminaryInvestigation is warranted.
    (1) The District Commander's opinion as to whether or not 
thecomplaint warrants a Preliminary Investigation will be formed 
throughinformal discussions with the complainant, users of the 
affectedwaterway, the owner of the bridge, and other interested parties.
    (2) In forming an opinion, the District Commander may also reviewthe 
district files, records of accidents, and details of anyadditional 
written complaints associated with the bridge in question.
    (b) In the absence of any written complaint, the DistrictCommander 
may decide, based on a bridge's accident history or othercriteria, to 
conduct a Preliminary Investigation.
    (c) The District Commander will inform the complainant and 
theAdministrator, Bridge Administration Program of the determination 
ofany Preliminary Review. If the District Commander decides that 
thebridge in question is not an unreasonable obstruction to 
navigation,the complainant will be provided with a brief summary of 
theinformation on which the District Commander based the decision 
andwill be informed of the appeal process described inSec. 116.55. 
There will be no further investigation, unlessadditional information 
warrants a continuance or reopening of thecase.

Sec. 116.15  Preliminary investigation.

    (a) During the Preliminary Investigation, the District Commanderwill 
prepare a written report containing all pertinent information andsubmit 
the report, together with a recommendation for or against thenecessity 
of a Detailed Investigation, to the Administrator, BridgeAdministration 
Program.
    (b) The Preliminary Investigation Report will include adescription 
of the nature and extent of the obstruction, thealterations to the 
bridge believed necessary to meet the reasonableneeds of existing and 
future navigation, the type and volume ofwaterway traffic, and a 
calculation of the benefits to navigationwhich would result from the 
proposed bridge alterations.
    (c) The Administrator, Bridge Administration Program will reviewthe 
Preliminary Investigation Report and make a Preliminary Decisionwhether 
or not to undertake a Detailed Investigation and a PublicMeeting.
    (d) If after reviewing the Preliminary Investigation Report, 
theAdministrator, Bridge Administration Program decides that 
furtherinvestigation is not warranted, the complainant will be notified 
ofthe decision. This notification will include a brief summary 
ofinformation on which the decision was based and details of the 
appealprocess described in Sec. 116.55.

<R05>
Sec. 116.20  Detailed investigation.

    (a) When the Administrator, Bridge Administration Programdetermines 
that a Detailed Investigation should be conducted, theDistrict Commander 
will initiate an investigation that addresses allof the pertinent data 
regarding the bridge, including informationobtained at a public meeting 
held under Sec. 116.25. As partof the investigation, the District 
Commander will develop acomprehensive report, termed the ``Detailed 
InvestigationReport'',

[[Page 549]]

which will discuss: the obstructive character ofthe bridge in question; 
the impact of that bridge upon navigation;navigational benefits derived; 
whether an alteration is needed to meetthe needs of navigation; and, if 
alteration is recommended, what type.
    (b) The District Commander will forward the completed 
DetailedInvestigation Report to the Administrator, Bridge 
AdministrationProgram for review together with a recommendation of 
whether thebridge should be declared an unreasonable obstruction to 
navigationand, if so, whether an Order to Alter should be issued.

<R05>
Sec. 116.25  Public meetings.

    (a) Any time the Administrator, Bridge Administration 
Programdetermines that a Detailed Investigation is warranted, or 
whenCongress declares a bridge unreasonably obstructive, the 
DistrictCommander will hold a public meeting near the location of the 
bridgeto provide the bridge owner, waterway users, and other 
interestedparties the opportunity to offer evidence and be heard, orally 
or inwriting, as to whether any alterations are necessary to 
providereasonably free, safe, and unobstructed passage for 
waterbornetraffic. The District Commander will issue a public notice 
announcingthe public meeting stating the time, date, and place of the 
meeting.
    (b) When a bridge is statutorily determined to be an 
unreasonableobstruction, the scope of the meeting will be to determine 
whatnavigation clearances are needed.
    (c) In all other cases, the scope of the meeting will be toaddress 
issues bearing on the question of whether the bridge is anunreasonable 
obstruction to navigation and, if so, what alterationsare needed.
    (d) The meeting will be recorded. Copies of the public 
meetingtranscript will be available for purchase from the recording 
service.

Sec. 116.30  Administrator, Bridge Administration Program Review andEvaluation.

    (a) Upon receiving a Detailed Investigation Report from a 
DistrictCommander, the Administrator, Bridge Administration Program 
willreview all the information and make a final determination of 
whetheror not the bridge is an unreasonable obstruction to navigation 
and, ifso, whether to issue an Order to Alter. This determination will 
beaccompanied by a supporting written Decision Analysis which 
willinclude a Benefit/Cost Analysis, including calculation of aBenefit/
Cost Ratio.
    (b) The Benefit/Cost ratio is calculated by dividing theannualized 
navigation benefit of the proposed bridge alteration by theannualized 
government share of the cost of the alteration.
    (c) Except for a bridge which is statutorily determined to be 
anunreasonable obstruction, an Order to Alter will not be issued 
underthe Truman-Hobbs Act unless the ratio is at least 1:1.
    (d) If a bridge is statutorily determined to unreasonably 
obstructnavigation, the Administrator, Bridge Administration Program 
willprepare a Decision Analysis to document and provide details of 
therequired vertical and horizontal clearances and the 
reasonsalterations are necessary.
    (e) If the Administrator, Bridge Administration Program decides 
torecommend that the Commandant issue an Order to Alter, or a bridge 
isstatutorily determined to unreasonably obstruct navigation, 
theAdministrator, Bridge Administration Program will issue a letter 
tothe bridge owner (``The 60-Day Letter'') at least 60 daysbefore the 
Commandant issues an Order to Alter. This letter willcontain the reasons 
an alteration is necessary, the proposedalteration, and, in the case of 
a Truman-Hobbs bridge, an estimate ofthe total project cost and the 
bridge owner's share.
    (f) If the bridge owner does not agree with the terms proposed inthe 
60-Day Letter, the owner may request a reevaluation of the terms.The 
request for a reevaluation must be in writing, and identify theterms for 
which reevaluation is requested. The request

[[Page 550]]

mayprovide additional information not previously presented.
    (g) Upon receipt of the bridge owner's response, theAdministrator, 
Bridge Administration Program will reevaluate thesituation based on the 
additional information submitted by the bridgeowner. If after the 
Administrator, Bridge Administration Programreviews the determination, 
there is no change, the Commandant mayissue an Order to Alter as set out 
in Sec. 116.35. TheAdministrator, Bridge Administration Program 
determination based onthe reevaluation will constitute final agency 
action.

<R05>
Sec. 116.35  Order to Alter.

    (a) If the bridge owner agrees with the contents of the 60-
DayLetter, if no reply is received by 60 days after the issuance of 
theletter, or if after reevaluation a bridge is determined to be 
anunreasonable obstruction to navigation, the Commandant will issue 
anOrder to Alter.
    (1) If a bridge is eligible for funding under the Truman-HobbsAct, 
the Order to Alter will specify the navigational clearances to 
beaccomplished in order to meet the reasonable needs of navigation.
    (2) An Order to Alter for a bridge that is not eligible forTruman-
Hobbs funding will specify the navigational clearances that arerequired 
to meet the reasonable needs of navigation and will prescribea 
reasonable time in which to accomplish them.
    (b) If appropriate, the Order to Alter will be accompanied by 
aletter of special conditions setting forth safeguards needed toprotect 
the environment or to provide for any special needs ofnavigation.
    (c) If a proposed alteration to a bridge has desirable, non-
navigational benefits, the Administrator, Bridge AdministrationProgram 
may require an equitable contribution from any interestedperson, firm, 
association, corporation, municipality, county, or statebenefiting from 
the alteration as a prerequisite to the making of anOrder to Alter for 
that alteration.
    (d) Failure to comply with any Order to Alter issued under 
theprovisions of this part will subject the owner or controller of 
thebridge to the penalties prescribed in 33 U.S.C. 495, 502, 519, or 
anyother applicable provision.

Sec. 116.40  Plans and specifications under the Truman-Hobbs Act.

    (a) After an Order to Alter has been issued to a bridge ownerunder 
the Truman-Hobbs Act, the Administrator, Bridge AdministrationProgram 
will issue a letter to the bridge owner outlining the 
owner'sresponsibilities to submit plans and specifications to 
theAdministrator, Bridge Administration Program for the alteration of 
thebridge. The plans and specifications, at a minimum, must provide 
forthe clearances identified in the Order to Alter. The plans 
andspecifications may also include any other additional alteration to 
thebridge that the owner considers desirable to meet the requirements 
ofrailroad or highway traffic. During the alteration process, 
balancedconsideration shall be given to the needs of rail, highway, and 
marinetraffic.
    (b) The Administrator, Bridge Administration Program will approveor 
reject the plans and specifications submitted by the bridge owner,in 
whole or in part, and may require the submission of new oradditional 
plans and specifications.
    (c) When Administrator, Bridge Administration Program has 
approvedthe submitted plans and specifications, they are final and 
bindingupon all parties, unless later changes are approved by 
theAdministrator, Bridge Administration Program. Any changes to 
theapproved plans will be coordinated with the District Commander.

    Lowerable means a non-structural vessel appurtenance that isor can 
be made flexible, hinged, collapsible, or telescopic so that itcan be 
mechanically or manually lowered.
    Nonstructural means that the item is not rigidly fixed tothe vessel 
and can be relocated or altered.
    Not essential to navigation means that a nonstructuralvessel 
appurtenance, when in the lowered position, would not adverselyaffect 
the vessel's piloting, propulsion, control, or collision-avoidance 
capabilities.
    Public vessel means a vessel that is owned and operated bythe United 
States Government and is not engaged in commercial service,as defined in 
46 U.S.C. 2101.
    Remotely operated drawbridge means a drawbridge that isoperated by

Sec. 117.9  Delaying opening of a draw.

    No person shall unreasonably delay the opening of a draw after 
thesignals required by Sec. 117.15 have been given.

    Note: Trains are usually controlled by the block method.That is, the 
track is divided into blocks or segments of a mile ormore in length. 
When a train is in a block with a drawbridge, the drawmay not be able to 
open until the train has passed out of the blockand the yardmaster or 
other manager has ``unlocked'' thedrawbridge controls. The maximum time 
permitted for delay is definedin Subpart B for each affected bridge. 
Land and water traffic shouldpass over or through the draw as soon as 
possible in order to preventunnecessary delays in the opening and 
closure of the draw.

bepassed through a draw during a scheduled closure period, the 
soundsignal to request the opening of the draw during that period is 
fiveshort blasts sounded in rapid succession.
    (4) When the draw can be opened immediately, the sound signal 
toacknowledge a request to open the draw is one prolonged blast 
followedby one short blast sounded not more than 30 seconds after 
therequesting signal.
    (5) When the draw cannot be opened immediately, or is open andshall 
be closed promptly, the sound signal to acknowledge a request toopen the 
draw is five short blasts sounded in rapid succession notmore than 30 
seconds after the vessel's opening signal. The signalshall be repeated 
until acknowledged in some manner by the requestingvessel.
    (c) Visual signals. (1) The visual signal to request theopening of a 
draw is--
    (i) A white flag raised and lowered vertically; or
    (ii) A white, amber, or green light raised and lowered vertically.
    (2) When the draw can be opened immediately, the visual signal 
toacknowledge a request to open the draw,

[[Page 559]]

given not more than 30seconds after the vessel's opening signal, is--
    (i) A white flag raised and lowered vertically;
    (ii) A white, amber, or green light raised and lowered vertically;or
    (iii) A fixed or flashing white, amber, or green light or lights.
    (3) When the draw cannot be opened immediately, or is open andmust 
be closed promptly, the visual signal to acknowledge a request toopen 
the draw is--
    (i) A red flag or red light swung back and forth horizontally infull 
sight of the vessel given not more than 30 seconds after thevessel's 
opening signal; or
    (ii) A fixed or flashing red light or lights given not more than30 
seconds after the vessel's opening signal.
    (4) The acknowledging signal when the draw cannot open immediatelyor 
is open and must be closed promptly shall be repeated untilacknowledged 
in some manner by the requesting vessel.
    (d) Radio telephone communications. (1) Radiotelephones maybe used 
to communicate the same information provided by sound andvisual signals.
    (2) The vessel and the drawtender shall monitor the frequency 
useduntil the vessel has cleared the draw.

toindicate that the drawspan is fully open.
    (2) The bridge is equipped with the following:
    (i) A radiotelephone link direct to the remote operator;
    (ii) A radar antenna on top of the drawspan capable of scanningthe 
river, one mile upstream and one mile downstream;
    (iii) Infrared boat detectors under the drawspan, to allow theremote 
bridge operator to detect vessels under the drawspan;
    (iv) Electronic motion detectors under the drawspan to allow 
theremote bridge operator to detect vessel movement under the drawspan;

remote bridgeoperator may begin lowering the drawspan. Navigation lights 
located atthe center of the drawspan change from green to red when the 
drawspanis not in the fully open to navigation position. The drawspan 
takesapproximately 90 seconds to lower.
    (7) If the presence of a vessel or other obstruction is 
discoveredapproaching or under the drawspan, during the lowering 
sequence,before the drawspan is fully lowered and locked, the drawspan 
shall bestopped and raised to the fully open position. When the vessel 
orobstruction has cleared the drawspan, the remote operator shallconfirm 
that the channel is clear and reinitiate the one minutewarning cycle 
before lowering the drawspan.
    (8) If no marine traffic is present the drawspan may be loweredand 
seated. When the drawspan is lowered and locked in the closed 
tonavigation position, the remote bridge operator 
periodicallybroadcasts, via marine radio, that: ``The drawspan of 
theEJ&E Railroad bridge is closed to navigation.''
    (9) Failure of the radar system, radio telephone system, 
infraredboat detectors or electronic motion sensors shall prevent 
lowering thedrawspan from the remote location.
    (10) when rail traffic has cleared the bridge, the remote 
bridgeoperator shall raise the drawspan to the fully open to 
navigationposition. When the drawspan is raised and in the fully open

day visibility of less than 500 feet, every two feet for anominal day 
visibility of more than 500 feet but less than 1,000 feet,and every five 
feet for nominal day visibility of more than 1,000feet.
    (4) Intermediate foot marks may be used when more 
precisedetermination of actual clearance is necessary. Such intermediate 
footmarks must have a width of stroke one-half the width of the 
strokerequired for the numeral and shall be three-quarters as long as 
theprimary foot marks.
    (5) The horizontal distance between the numeral and nearest edgeof 
the white background shall be no less than one-half the width of asingle 
numeral (excepting numerals 1 and 4).
    (6) The minimum width of the white background shall be no lessthan 
three times the width of a single numeral (excepting numerals 1and 4) 
plus the widths of each additional numeral (when multiplenumerals are 
used plus numeral spacing).
    (e) Maintenance. The owner or operator of the bridge shallmaintain 
each gauge in good repair and legible condition. The bridgeowner or 
operator is responsible for the accuracy of the gauge andshall remeasure 
the vertical distance of the numerals and foot marksbelow ``low steel'' 
of the bridge whenever the gauge isrepainted or the structure is 
repaired.
