                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, April 1, 2012), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
April 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning April 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

    The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of 
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a 
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used 
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and 
not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.

[[Page vii]]

    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

sell or otherwise dispose of distilled spirits in bulk (other than 
alcohol) for industrial use, unless such distilled spirits are shipped 
or delivered directly to the industrial user thereof.

                Subpart C_Standards of Identity for Wine


<R05>
Sec. 4.20  Application of standards.

    The standards of identity for the several classes and types of wine 
set forth herein shall be applicable to all regulations and permits 
issued under the act. Whenever any term for which a standard of identity 
has been established herein is used in any such regulation or permit, 
such term shall have the meaning assigned to it by such standard of 
identity.

[[Page 16]]


<R05>
Sec. 4.21  The standards of identity.

    Standards of identity for the several classes and types of wine set 
forth in this part shall be as follows:
    (a) Class 1; grape wine--(1) Grape wine is wine produced by the 
normal alcoholic fermentation of the juice of sound, ripe grapes 
(including restored or unrestored pure condensed grape must), with or 
without the addition, after fermentation, of pure condensed grape must, 
and with or without added grape brandy or alcohol, but without other 
addition or abstraction except as may occur in cellar treatment: 
Provided, That the product may be ameliorated before, during or after 
fermentation by either of the following methods:
    (i) By adding, separately or in combination, dry sugar, or such an 
amount of sugar and water solution as will not increase the volume of 
the resulting product more than 35 percent; but in no event shall any 
product so ameliorated have an alcoholic content derived by 
fermentation, of more than 13 percent by volume, or a natural acid 
content, if water has been added, of less than 5 parts per thousand, or 
a total solids content of more than 22 grams per 100 cubic centimeters.
    (ii) By adding, separately or in combination, not more than 20 
percent by weight of dry sugar, or not more than 10 percent by weight of 
water.
    (iii) In the case of domestic wine, in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 
5383.
    (iv) The maximum volatile acidity, calculated as acetic acid and 
exclusive of sulfur dioxide is 0.14 gram per 100 mL (20 [deg]C) for 
natural red wine and 0.12 gram per 100 mL (20 [deg]C) for other grape 
wine: Provided, That the maximum volatile acidity for wine produced from 
unameliorated juice of 28 or more degrees Brix is 0.17 gram per 100 
milliliters for red wine and 0.15 gram per 100 milliliters for white 
wine. Grape wine deriving its characteristic color or lack of color from 
the presence or absence of the red coloring matter of the skins, juice, 
or pulp of grapes may be designated as ``red wine,'' ``pink (or rose) 
wine,'' ``amber wine,'' or ``white wine'' as the case may be. Any grape 
wine containing no added grape brandy or alcohol may be further 
designated as ``natural.''
    (2) Table wine is grape wine having an alcoholic content not in 
excess of 14 percent by volume. Such wine may also be designated as 
``light wine,'' ``red table wine,'' ``light white wine,'' ``sweet table 
wine,'' etc., as the case may be.
    (3) Dessert wine is grape wine having an alcoholic content in excess 
of 14 percent but not in excess of 24 percent by volume. Dessert wine 
having the taste, aroma and characteristics generally attributed to 
sherry and an alcoholic content, derived in part from added grape brandy 
or alcohol, of not less than 17 percent by volume, may be designated as 
``sherry''. Dessert wines having the taste, aroma and characteristics 
generally attributed to angelica, madeira, muscatel and port and an 
alcoholic content, derived in part from added grape brandy or alcohol, 
of not less than 18 percent by volume, may be designated as 
``angelica,'' ``madeira,'' ``muscatel,'' or ``port'' respectively. 
Dessert wines having the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally 
attributed to any of the above products and an alcoholic content, 
derived in part from added grape brandy or alcohol, in excess of 14 
percent by volume but, in the case of sherry, less than 17 percent, or, 
in other cases, less than 18 percent by volume, may be designated as 
``light sherry,'' ``light angelica,'' ``light madeira,'' ``light 
muscatel'' or ``light port,'' respectively.
    (b) Class 2; sparkling grape wine. (1) Sparkling grape wine 
(including ``sparkling wine,'' ``sparkling red wine'' and ``sparkling 
white wine'') is grape wine made effervescent with carbon dioxide 
resulting solely from the fermentation of the wine within a closed 
container, tank or bottle.
    (2) Champagne is a type of sparkling light wine which derives its 
effervescence solely from the secondary fermentation of the wine within 
glass containers of not greater than one gallon capacity, and which 
possesses the taste, aroma, and other characteristics attributed to 
champagne as made in the champagne district of France.
    (3)(i) A sparkling light wine having the taste, aroma, and 
characteristics generally attributed to champagne but not otherwise 
conforming to the standard for ``champagne'' may, in addition

[[Page 17]]

to but not in lieu of the class designation ``sparkling wine,'' be 
further designated as:
    (A) ``Champagne style;'' or
    (B) ``Champagne type;'' or
    (C) ``American (or New York State, Napa Valley, etc.) champagne,'' 
along with one of the following terms: ``Bulk process,'' ``fermented 
outside the bottle,'' ``secondary fermentation outside the bottle,'' 
``secondary fermentation before bottling,'' ``not fermented in the 
bottle,'' or ``not bottle fermented.'' The term ``charmat method'' or 
``charmat process'' may be used as additional information.
    (ii) Labels shall be so designed that all the words in such further 
designation are readily legible under ordinary conditions and are on a 
contrasting background. In the case of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(C) of this 
section, TTB will consider whether the label as a whole provides the 
consumer with adequate information about the method of production and 
origin of the wine. TTB will evaluate each label for legibility and 
clarity, based on such factors as type size and style for all components 
of the further designation and the optional term ``charmat method'' or 
``charmat process,'' as well as the contrast between the lettering and 
its background, and the placement of information on the label.
    (iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A), (B) 
and (C) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer may authorize the 
use of a term on sparkling wine labels, as an alternative to those terms 
authorized in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, but not in lieu of 
the required class designation ``sparkling wine,'' upon a finding that 
such term adequately informs the consumer about the method of production 
of the sparkling wine.
    (4) Crackling wine, petillant wine, frizzante wine (including 
cremant, perlant, reciotto, and other similar wine) is sparkling light 
wine normally less effervescent than champagne or other similar 
sparkling wine, but containing sufficient carbon dioxide in solution to 
produce, upon pouring under normal conditions, after the disappearance 
of air bubbles, a slow and steady effervescence evidenced by the 
formation of gas bubbles flowing through the wine. Crackling wine which 
derives its effervescence from secondary fermentation in containers 
greater than 1-gallon capacity shall be designated ``crackling wine--
bulk process,'' and the words ``bulk process'' shall appear in lettering 
of substantially the same size as the words ``crackling wine.''
    (c) Class 3; carbonated grape wine. ``Carbonated grape wine'' 
(including ``carbonated wine,'' ``carbonated red wine,'' and 
``carbonated white wine'') is grape wine made effervescent with carbon 
dioxide other than that resulting solely from the secondary fermentation 
of the wine within a closed container, tank or bottle.
    (d) Class 4; citrus wine. (1)(i) Citrus wine or citrus fruit wine is 
wine produced by the normal alcoholic fermentation of the juice of 
sound, ripe citrus fruit (including restored or unrestored pure 
condensed citrus must), with or without the addition, after 
fermentation, of pure condensed citrus must, and with or without added 
citrus brandy or alcohol, but without any other addition or abstraction 
except as may occur in cellar treatment: Provided, That a domestic 
product may be ameliorated or sweetened in accordance with the 
provisions of 26 U.S.C. 5384 and any product other than domestic may be 
ameliorated before, during, or after fermentation by adding, separately 
or in combination, dry sugar, or such an amount of sugar and water 
solution as will not increase the volume of the resulting product more 
than 35 percent, or in the case of products produced from citrus fruit 
having a normal acidity of 20 parts or more per thousand, not more than 
60 percent, but in no event shall any product so ameliorated have an 
alcoholic content, derived by fermentation, of more than 14 percent by 
volume, or a natural acid content, if water has been added, of less than 
5 parts per thousand, or a total solids content or more than 22 grams 
per 100 cubic centimeters.
    (ii) The maximum volatile acidity, calculated as acetic acid and 
exclusive of sulfur dioxide, shall not be, for natural citrus wine, more 
than 0.14 gram, and for other citrus wine, more than 0.12 gram, per 100 
milliliters (20 [deg]C.).

[[Page 18]]

    (iii) Any citrus wine containing no added brandy or alcohol may be 
further designated as ``natural.''
    (2) Citrus table wine or citrus fruit table wine is citrus wine 
having an alcoholic content not in excess of 14 percent by volume. Such 
wine may also be designated ``light citrus wine,'' ``light citrus fruit 
wine,'' ``light sweet citrus fruit wine,'' etc., as the case may be.
    (3) Citrus dessert wine or citrus fruit dessert wine is citrus wine 
having an alcoholic content in excess of 14 percent but not in excess of 
24 percent by volume.
    (4) Citrus wine derived wholly (except for sugar, water, or added 
alcohol) from one kind of citrus fruit, shall be designated by the word 
``wine'' qualified by the name of such citrus fruit, e.g., ``orange 
wine,'' ``grapefruit wine.'' Citrus wine not derived wholly from one 
kind of citrus fruit shall be designated as ``citrus wine'' or ``citrus 
fruit wine'' qualified by a truthful and adequate statement of 
composition appearing in direct conjunction therewith. Citrus wine 
rendered effervescent by carbon dioxide resulting solely from the 
secondary fermentation of the wine within a closed container, tank, or 
bottle shall be further designated as ``sparkling''; and citrus wine 
rendered effervescent by carbon dioxide otherwise derived shall be 
further designated as ``carbonated.''
    (e) Class 5; fruit wine. (1)(i) Fruit wine is wine (other than grape 
wine or citrus wine) produced by the normal alcoholic fermentation of 
the juice of sound, ripe fruit (including restored or unrestored pure 
condensed fruit must), with or without the addition, after fermentation, 
of pure condensed fruit must, and with or without added fruit brandy or 
alcohol, but without other addition or abstraction except as may occur 
in cellar treatment: Provided, That a domestic product may be 
ameliorated or sweetened in accordance with the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 
5384 and any product other than domestic may be ameliorated before, 
during, or after fermentation by adding, separately or in combination, 
dry sugar, or such an amount of dry sugar and water solution as will 
increase the volume of the resulting product, in the case of wines 
produced from any fruit or berry other than grapes, having a normal 
acidity of 20 parts or more per thousand, not more than 60 percent, and 
in the case of other fruit wines, not more than 35%, but in no event 
shall any product so ameliorated have an alcoholic content, derived by 
fermentation, of more than 14 percent by volume, or a natural acid 
content, if water has been added, of less than 5 parts per thousand, or 
a total solids content of more than 22 grams per 100 cubic centimeters.
    (ii) The maximum volatile acidity, calculated as acetic acid and 
exclusive of sulfur dioxide, shall not be, for natural fruit wine, more 
than 0.14 gram, and for other fruit wine, more than 0.12 gram, per 100 
milliliters (20 [deg]C.).
    (iii) Any fruit wine containing no added brandy or alcohol may be 
further designated as ``natural.''
    (2) Berry wine is fruit wine produced from berries.
    (3) Fruit table wine or berry table wine is fruit or berry wine 
having an alcoholic content not in excess of 14 percent by volume. Such 
wine may also be designated ``light fruit wine,'' or ``light berry 
wine.''
    (4) Fruit dessert wine or berry dessert wine is fruit or berry wine 
having an alcoholic content in excess of 14 percent but not in excess of 
24 percent by volume.
    (5) Fruit wine derived wholly (except for sugar, water, or added 
alcohol) from one kind of fruit shall be designated by the word ``wine'' 
qualified by the name of such fruit, e.g., ``peach wine,'' ``blackberry 
wine.'' Fruit wine not derived wholly from one kind of fruit shall be 
designated as ``fruit wine'' or ``berry wine,'' as the case may be, 
qualified by a truthful and adequate statement of composition appearing 
in direct conjunction therewith. Fruit wines which are derived wholly 
(except for sugar, water, or added alcohol) from apples or pears may be 
designated ``cider'' and ``perry,'' respectively, and shall be so 
designated if lacking in vinous taste, aroma, and characteristics. Fruit 
wine rendered effervescent by carbon dioxide resulting solely from the 
secondary fermentation of the wine within a closed container, tank, or 
bottle shall be further designated as ``sparkling''; and fruit wine 
rendered

[[Page 19]]

effervescent by carbon dioxide otherwise derived shall be further 
designated as ``carbonated.''
    (f) Class 6; wine from other agricultural products. (1)(i) Wine of 
this class is wine (other than grape wine, citrus wine, or fruit wine) 
made by the normal alcoholic fermentation of sound fermentable 
agricultural products, either fresh or dried, or of the restored or 
unrestored pure condensed must thereof, with the addition before or 
during fermentation of a volume of water not greater than the minimum 
necessary to correct natural moisture deficiencies in such products, 
with or without the addition, after fermentation, of pure condensed 
must, and with or without added alcohol or such other spirits as will 
not alter the character of the product, but without other addition or 
abstraction except as may occur in cellar treatment: Provided, That a 
domestic product may be ameliorated or sweetened in accordance with part 
24, of this chapter, and any product other than domestic may be 
ameliorated before, during, or after fermentation by adding, separately 
or in combination, dry sugar or such an amount of sugar and water 
solution as will not increase the volume of the resulting product more 
than 35 percent, but in no event shall any product so ameliorated have 
an alcoholic content, derived by fermentation of more than 14 percent by 
volume, or a natural acid content, if water has been added, of less than 
5 parts per thousand, or a total solids content of more than 22 grams 
per 100 cubic centimeters.
    (ii) The maximum volatile acidity, calculated as acetic acid and 
exclusive of sulfur dioxide, shall not be, for natural wine of this 
class, more than 0.14 gram, and for other wine of this class, more than 
0.12 gram, per 100 milliliters (20 [deg]C.).
    (iii) Wine of this class containing no added alcohol or other 
spirits may be further designated as ``natural''.
    (2) Table wine of this class is wine having an alcoholic content not 
in excess of 14 percent by volume. Such wine may also be designated as 
``light''.

semi-generic only if so found by the Administrator. Semi-generic 
designations may be used to designate wines of an origin other than that 
indicated by such name only if there appears in direct conjunction 
therewith an appropriate appellation of origin disclosing the true place 
of origin of the wine, and if the wine so designated conforms to the 
standard of identity, if any, for such wine contained in the regulations 
in this part or, if there be no such standard, to the trade 
understanding of such class or type. See Sec. 24.257(c) of this chapter

designate wines of the origin indicated by such name, but such name 
shall not be deemed to be the distinctive designation of a wine unless 
the Administrator finds that it is known to the consumer and to the 
trade as the designation of a specific wine of a particular place or 
region, distinguishable from all other wines.
    (2) Examples of nongeneric names which are not distinctive 
designations of specific grape wines are: American, California, Lake 
Erie, Napa Valley, New York State, French, Spanish. Additional examples 
of foreign nongeneric names are listed in subpart C of part 12 of this 
chapter.

Sec. 4.27  Vintage wine.

    (a) General. Vintage wine is wine labeled with the year of harvest 
of the grapes and made in accordance with the standards prescribed in 
classes 1, 2, or 3 of Sec. 4.21. The wine must be labeled with an 
appellation of origin other than a country (which does not qualify for 
vintage labeling). The appellation must be shown in direct conjunction 
with the designation required by Sec. 4.32(a)(2), in lettering 
substantially as conspicuous as that designation. In no event may the 
quantity of wine removed from the producing winery, under labels bearing 
a vintage date, exceed the volume of vintage wine produced in that 
winery during the year indicated by the vintage date. The following 
additional rules apply to vintage labeling:
    (1) If an American or imported wine is labeled with a viticultural 
area appellation of origin (or its foreign equivalent), at least 95 
percent of the wine must have been derived from grapes harvested in the 
labeled calendar year; or
    (2) If an American or imported wine is labeled with an appellation 
of origin other than a country or viticultural area (or its foreign 
equivalent), at least 85 percent of the wine must have been derived from 
grapes harvested in the labeled calendar year.
    (b) American wine. A permittee who produced and bottled or packed 
the wine, or a person other than the producer who repackaged the wine in 
containers of 5 liters or less may show the year of vintage upon the 
label if the person possesses appropriate records from the producer 
substantiating the year of vintage and the appellation of origin; and if 
the wine is made in compliance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (c) Imported wine. Imported wine may bear a vintage date if all of 
the following conditions are met:
    (1) It is made in compliance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of 
this section;
    (2) It is bottled in containers of 5 liters or less prior to 
importation, or it is bottled in the United States from the original 
container of the product (showing a vintage date); and
    (3) The invoice is accompanied by, or the American bottler 
possesses, a certificate issued by a duly authorized official of the 
country of origin (if the country of origin authorizes the issuance of 
such certificates) certifying that the wine is of the vintage shown, 
that the laws of the country regulate the appearance of vintage dates 
upon the labels of wine produced for consumption within the country of 
origin, that the wine has been produced in conformity with those laws, 
and that the wine would be entitled to bear the vintage date if it had 
been sold within the country of origin.

American wine. These names may be used as type designations for American 
wines only

[[Page 26]]

if the wine is labeled with an appellation of origin as defined in Sec. 
4.25.
    (a) Muscadine. An American wine which derives at least 75 percent of 
its volume from Muscadinia rotundifolia grapes.
    (b) Muscatel. An American wine which derives its predominant taste, 
aroma, characteristics and at least 75 percent of its volume from any 
Muscat grape source, and which meets the requirements of Sec. 
4.21(a)(3).
    (c) Muscat or Moscato. An American wine which derives at least 75 
percent of its volume from any Muscat grape source.
    (d) Scuppernong. An American wine which derives at least 75 percent 
of its volume from bronze Muscadinia rotundifolia grapes.
    (e)(1) Gamay Beaujolais. An American wine which derives at least 75 
percent of its volume from Pinot noir grapes, Valdigui[eacute] grapes, 
or a combination of both.
    (2) For wines bottled on or after January 1, 1999, and prior to 
April 9, 2007, the name ``Gamay Beaujolais'' may be used as a type 
designation only if there appears in direct conjunction therewith, but 
on a separate line and separated by the required appellation of origin, 
the name(s) of the grape variety or varieties used to satisfy the 
requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Where two varietal 
names are listed, they shall appear on the same line, in order of 
predominance. The appellation of origin shall appear either on a 
separate line between the name ``Gamay Beaujolais'' and the grape 
variety name(s) or on the same line as the grape variety name(s) in a 
manner that qualifies the grape variety name(s). The following statement 
shall also appear on the brand or back label: ``Gamay Beaujolais is made 
from at least 75 percent Pinot noir and/or Valdigui[eacute] grapes.''
    (3) The designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' may not be used on labels 
of American wines bottled on or after April 9, 2007.

Sec. 4.32a  Voluntary disclosure of major food allergens.

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section the following terms 
have the meanings indicated.
    (1) Major food allergen. Major food allergen means any of the 
following:
    (i) Milk, egg, fish (for example, bass, flounder, or cod), 
Crustacean shellfish (for example, crab, lobster, or shrimp), tree nuts 
(for example, almonds, pecans, or walnuts), wheat, peanuts, and 
soybeans; or
    (ii) A food ingredient that contains protein derived from a food 
specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, except:
    (A) Any highly refined oil derived from a food specified in 
paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section and any ingredient derived from such 
highly refined oil; or
    (B) A food ingredient that is exempt from major food allergen 
labeling requirements pursuant to a petition for exemption approved by 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under 21 U.S.C. 343(w)(6) or 
pursuant to a notice submitted to FDA under 21 U.S.C. 343(w)(7), 
provided that the food ingredient meets the terms or conditions, if any, 
specified for that exemption.
    (2) Name of the food source from which each major food allergen is 
derived. Name of the food source from which each major food allergen is 
derived means the name of the food as listed in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of 
this section, except that:
    (i) In the case of a tree nut, it means the name of the specific 
type of nut (for example, almonds, pecans, or walnuts);
    (ii) In the case of Crustacean shellfish, it means the name of the 
species

[[Page 28]]

of Crustacean shellfish (for example, crab, lobster, or shrimp); and
    (iii) The names ``egg'' and ``peanuts'', as well as the names of the 
different types of tree nuts, may be expressed in either the singular or 
plural form, and the term ``soy'', soybean'', or ``soya'' may be used 
instead of ``soybeans''.
    (b) Voluntary labeling standards. Major food allergens (defined in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section) used in the production of a wine may, 
on a voluntary basis, be declared on any label affixed to the container. 
However, if any one major food allergen is voluntarily declared, all 
major food allergens used in production of the wine, including major 
food allergens used as fining or processing agents, must be declared, 
except when covered by a petition for exemption approved by the 
appropriate TTB officer under Sec. 4.32b. The major food allergens 
declaration must consist of the word ``Contains'' followed by a colon 
and the name of the food source from which each major food allergen is 
derived (for example, ``Contains: egg'').
    (c) Cross reference. For mandatory labeling requirements applicable 
to wines containing FD&C Yellow No. 5 and sulfites, see Sec. Sec. 
4.32(c) and (e).

<R05>
Sec. 4.32b  Petitions for exemption from major food allergen labeling.

    (a) Submission of petition. Any person may petition the appropriate 
TTB officer to exempt a particular product or class of products from the 
labeling requirements of Sec. 4.32a. The burden is on the petitioner to 
provide scientific evidence (including the analytical method used to 
produce the evidence) that demonstrates that the finished product or 
class of products, as derived by the method specified in the petition, 
either:
    (1) Does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human 
health; or
    (2) Does not contain allergenic protein derived from one of the 
foods identified in Sec. 4.32a(a)(1)(i), even though a major food 
allergen was used in production.
    (b) Decision on petition. TTB will approve or deny a petition for 
exemption submitted under paragraph (a) of this section in writing 
within 180 days of receipt of the petition. If TTB does not provide a 
written response to the petitioner within that 180-day period, the 
petition will be deemed denied, unless an extension of time for decision 
is mutually agreed upon by the appropriate TTB officer and the 
petitioner. TTB may confer with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
on petitions for exemption, as appropriate and as FDA resources permit. 
TTB may require the submission of product samples and other additional 
information in support of a petition; however, unless required by TTB, 
the submission of samples or additional information by the petitioner 
after submission of the petition will be treated as the withdrawal of 
the initial petition and the submission of a new petition. An approval 
or denial under this section will constitute a final agency action.
    (c) Resubmission of a petition. After a petition for exemption is 
denied under this section, the petitioner may resubmit the petition 
along with supporting materials for reconsideration at any time. TTB 
will treat this submission as a new petition for purposes of the time 
frames for decision set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Availability of information--(1) General. TTB will promptly post 
to its public Web site, http://www.ttb.gov, all petitions received under 
this section as well as TTB's responses to those petitions. Any 
information submitted in support of the petition that is not posted to 
the TTB Web site will be available to the public pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552, except where a request for confidential treatment is granted under 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (2) Requests for confidential treatment of business information. A 
person who provides trade secrets or other commercial or financial 
information in connection with a petition for exemption under this 
section may request that TTB give confidential treatment to that 
information. A failure to request confidential treatment at the time the 
information in question is submitted to TTB will constitute a waiver of 
confidential treatment. A request for confidential treatment of 
information under this section must conform to the following standards:

[[Page 29]]

    (i) The request must be in writing;
    (ii) The request must clearly identify the information to be kept 
confidential;
    (iii) The request must relate to information that constitutes trade 
secrets or other confidential commercial or financial information 
regarding the business transactions of an interested person, the 
disclosure of which would cause substantial harm to the competitive 
position of that person;
    (iv) The request must set forth the reasons why the information 
should not be disclosed, including the reasons the disclosure of the 
information would prejudice the competitive position of the interested 
person; and
    (v) The request must be supported by a signed statement by the 
interested person, or by an authorized officer or employee of that 
person, certifying that the information in question is a trade secret or 
other confidential commercial or financial information and that the 
information is not already in the public domain.

Sec. 4.33  Brand names.

    (a) General. The product shall bear a brand name, except that if not 
sold under a brand name, then the name of the person required to appear 
on the brand label shall be deemed a brand name for the purpose of this 
part.
    (b) Misleading brand names. No label shall contain any brand name, 
which, standing alone, or in association with other printed or graphic 
matter creates any impression or inference as to the age, origin, 
identity, or other characteristics of the product unless the appropriate 
TTB officer finds that such brand name, either when qualified by the 
word ``brand'' or when not so qualified, conveys no erroneous 
impressions as to the age, origin, identity, or other characteristics of 
the product.
    (c) Trade name of foreign origin. This section shall not operate to 
prohibit the use by any person of any trade name or brand of foreign 
origin not effectively registered in the United States Patent Office on 
August 29, 1935, which has been used by such person or his predecessors 
in the United States for a period of at least five years immediately 
preceding August 29, 1935: Provided, That if such trade name or brand is 
used, the designation of the product shall be qualified by the name of 
the locality in the United States in which produced, and such 
qualifications shall be in script, type, or printing as conspicuous as 
the trade name or brand.


<R05>
Sec. 4.34  Class and type.

    (a) The class of the wine shall be stated in conformity with subpart 
C of this part if the wine is defined therein, except that ``table'' 
(``light'') and ``dessert'' wines need not be designated as such. In the 
case of still grape wine there may appear, in lieu of the class 
designation, any varietal (grape type) designation, type designation of 
varietal significance, semigeneric geographic type designation, or 
geographic distinctive designation, to which the wine may be entitled. 
In the case of champagne, or crackling wines, the type designation 
``champagne'' or ``crackling wine'' (``petillant wine'', ``frizzante 
wine'') may appear in lieu of the class designation ``sparkling wine''. 
In the case of wine which has a total solids content of more than 17 
grams per 100 cubic centimeters the words ``extra sweet'', ``specially 
sweetened'', ``specially sweet'' or ``sweetened with excess sugar'' 
shall be stated as a part of the class and type designation. The last of 
these quoted phrases shall appear where required by part 24 of this 
chapter, on wines sweetened with sugar in excess of the maximum 
quantities specified in such regulations. If the class of the wine is 
not defined in subpart C, a truthful and adequate statement of 
composition shall appear upon the brand label of the product in lieu of 
a class designation. In addition to the mandatory designation for the 
wine, there may be stated a distinctive or fanciful name, or a 
designation in accordance with trade understanding. The statement of 
composition will not include any reference to a varietal (grape type) 
designation, type designation of varietal significance, semi-generic 
geographic type designation, or geographic distinctive designation. All 
parts of the designation of the wine, whether mandatory or optional, 
shall be in direct conjunction and in lettering substantially of the 
same size and kind.

[[Page 30]]

    (b) An appellation of origin such as ``American,'' ``New York,'' 
``Napa Valley,'' or ``Chilean,'' disclosing the true place of origin of 
the wine, shall appear in direct conjunction with and in lettering 
substantially as conspicuous as the class and type designation if:
    (1) A varietal (grape type) designation is used under the provisions 
of Sec. 4.23;
    (2) A type designation of varietal significance is used under the 
provisions of Sec. 4.28;
    (3) A semi-generic type designation is employed as the class and 
type designation of the wine pursuant to Sec. 4.24(b);
    (4) A product name is qualified with the word ``Brand'' under the 
requirements of Sec. 4.39 (j); or
    (5) The wine is labeled with the year of harvest of the grapes, and 
otherwise conforms with the provisions of Sec. 4.27. The appellation of 
origin for vintage wine shall be other than a country.

type designation ``table'' wine (``light'' wine) or the alcoholic 
content shall be stated. Any statement of alcoholic content shall be 
made as prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Alcoholic content shall be stated in terms of percentage of 
alcohol by volume, and not otherwise, as provided in either paragraph 
(b)(1) or (2) of this section:
    (1) ``Alcohol ---- % by volume,'' or similar appropriate phrase; 
Provided, that if the word ``alcohol'' and/or ``volume'' are 
abbreviated, they shall be shown as ``alc.'' (alc) and/or ``vol.'' 
(vol), respectively. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, a tolerance of 1 percent, in the case of wines containing more 
than 14 percent of alcohol by volume, and of 1.5 percent, in the case of

such minimum or above such maximum.

[[Page 32]]

    (c) Regardless of the type of statement used and regardless of 
tolerances normally permitted in direct statements and ranges normally 
permitted in maximum and minimum statements, alcoholic content 
statements, whether required or optional, shall definitely and correctly 
indicate the class, type and taxable grade of the wine so labeled and 
nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing the appearance 
upon the labels of any wine of an alcoholic content statement in terms 
of maximum and minimum percentages which overlaps a prescribed 
limitation on the alcoholic content of any class, type, or taxable grade 
of wine, or a direct statement of alcoholic content which indicates that 
the alcoholic content of the wine is within such a limitation when in 
fact it is not.

    (1) For the metric standards of fill: 3 liters (101 fl. oz.); 1.5 
liters (50.7 fl. oz.); 1 liter (33.8 fl. oz.); 750 ml (25.4 fl. oz.); 
500 ml (16.9 fl. oz.); 375 ml (12.7 fl. oz.); 187 ml (6.3 fl. oz.); 100 
ml (3.4 fl. oz.); and 50 ml (1.7 fl. oz.).
    (2) Equivalent volumes of less than 100 fluid ounces will be stated 
in fluid ounces only, accurate to the nearest one-tenth of a fluid 
ounce; for example, 700 ml (23.7 fl. oz.).
    (3) Equivalent volumes of 100 fluid ounces or more will be stated in 
fluid ounces only, accurate to the nearest whole fluid ounce; for 
example, 6 liters (203 fl. oz.).
    (c) Net contents marked in bottle. The net contents need not be 
stated on any label if the net contents are displayed by having the same 
blown, etched, sand-blasted, marked by underglaze coloring, or otherwise 
permanently marked by any method approved by the appropriate TTB 
officer, in the sides, front, or back of the bottle, in letters and 
figures in such manner as to be plainly legible under ordinary 
circumstances, and such statement is not obscured in any manner in whole 
or in part.
    (d) Tolerances. Statement of net contents shall indicate exactly the 
volume of wine within the container, except that the following 
tolerances shall be allowed:
    (1) Discrepancies due exclusively to errors in measuring which occur 
in filling conducted in compliance with good commercial practice.
    (2) Discrepancies due exclusively to differences in the capacity of 
containers, resulting solely from unavoidable difficulties in 
manufacturing such containers so as to be of uniform capacity: Provided, 
That no greater tolerance shall be allowed in case of containers which, 
because of their design, cannot be made of approximately uniform 
capacity than is allowed in case of containers which can be manufactured 
so as to be of approximately uniform capacity.
    (3) Discrepancies in measure due to differences in atmospheric 
conditions in various places and which unavoidably result from the 
ordinary and customary exposure of alcoholic beverages in containers to 
evaporation. The reasonableness to discrepancies under this paragraph 
shall be determined on the facts in each case.
    (e) Unreasonable shortages. Unreasonable shortages in certain of the 
containers in any shipment shall not be

[[Page 33]]

compensated by overages in other containers in the same shipment.

ingredient in any wine, or used in its production, the label containing 
such representation shall state, in print, type, or script, 
substantially as conspicuous as such representation, the name and amount 
in percent by volume of each such ingredient.
    (h) Statement of contents of containers. Upon request of the 
appropriate TTB officer, there shall be submitted a full and accurate 
statement of the contents of the containers to which labels are to be or

<R05>
Sec. 4.39  Prohibited practices.

    (a) Statements on labels. Containers of wine, or any label on such 
containers, or any individual covering, carton, or other wrapper of such 
container, or any written, printed, graphic, or other matter 
accompanying such container to the consumer shall not contain:
    (1) Any statement that is false or untrue in any particular, or 
that, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, omission, or 
inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific or technical 
matter, tends to create a misleading impression.
    (2) Any statement that is disparaging of a competitor's products.
    (3) Any statement, design, device, or representation which is 
obscene or indecent.
    (4) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating 
to analyses, standards, or tests, irrespective of falsity, which the 
appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer.
    (5) Any statement, design, device or representation of or relating 
to any guarantee, irrespective of falsity, which the appropriate TTB 
officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer. Money-back 
guarantees are not prohibited.
    (6) A trade or brand name that is the name of any living individual 
of public prominence, or existing private or public organization, or is 
a name that is in simulation or is an abbreviation thereof, or any 
graphic, pictorial, or emblematic representation of any such individual 
or organization, if the use of such name or representation is likely 
falsely to lead the consumer to believe that the product has been 
endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision 
of, or in accordance with the specifications of, such individual or 
organization; Provided, That this paragraph shall not apply to the use 
of the name of any person engaged in business as a producer, blender, 
rectifier, importer, wholesaler, retailer, bottler, or warehouseman of 
wine, nor to the use by any person of a trade or brand name that is the 
name of any living individual of public prominence or existing private 
or public organization, provided such trade or brand name was used by 
him or his predecessors in interest prior to August 29, 1935.
    (7) Any statement, design, device, or representation (other than a 
statement of alcohol content in conformity with Sec. 4.36), which tends 
to create the impression that a wine:
    (i) Contains distilled spirits;
    (ii) Is comparable to a distilled spirit; or
    (iii) Has intoxicating qualities.

However, if a statement of composition is required to appear as the 
designation of a product not defined in these regulations, such 
statement of composition may include a reference to the type of 
distilled spirits contained therein.
    (8) Any coined word or name in the brand name or class and type 
designation which simulates, imitates, or which tends to create the 
impression that the wine so labeled is entitled to bear, any class, 
type, or permitted designation recognized by the regulations in this 
part unless such wine conforms

[[Page 35]]

to the requirements prescribed with respect to such designation and is 
in fact so designated on its labels.
    (9) Any word in the brand name or class and type designation which 
is the name of a distilled spirits product or which simulates, imitates, 
or created the impression that the wine so labeled is, or is similar to, 
any product customarily made with a distilled spirits base. Examples of 
such words are: ``Manhattan,'' ``Martini,'' and ``Daquiri'' in a class 
and type designation or brand name of a wine cocktail; ``Cuba Libre,'' 
``Zombie,'' and ``Collins'' in a class and type designation or brand 
name of a wine specialty or wine highball; ``creme,'' ``cream,'' ``de,'' 
or ``of'' when used in conjunction with ``menthe,'' ``mint,'' or 
``cacao'' in a class and type designation or a brand name of a mint or 
chocolate flavored wine specialty.
    (b) Statement of age. No statement of age or representation relative 
to age (including words or devices in any brand name or mark) shall be 
made, except (1) for vintage wine, in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 4.27; (2) references relating to methods of wine production 
involving storage or aging in accordance with Sec. 4.38(f); or (3) use 
of the word ``old'' as part of a brand name.
    (c) Statement of bottling dates. The statement of any bottling date 
shall not be deemed to be a representation relative to age, if such 
statement appears in lettering not greater than 8-point Gothic caps and 
in the following form: ``Bottled in ----'' (inserting the year in which 
the wine was bottled).
    (d) Statement of miscellaneous dates. No date, except as provided in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section with respect to statement of 
vintage year and bottling date, shall be stated on any label unless in 
addition thereto and in direct conjunction therewith in the same size 
and kind of printing, there shall be stated an explanation of the 
significance thereof such as ``established'' or ``founded in''. If any 
such date refers to the date of establishment of any business or brand 
name, it shall not be stated, in the case of containers of a capacity of 
5 liters or less, in any script, type, or printing larger than 2 
millimeters, and shall be stated in direct conjunction with the name of 
the person, company, or brand name to which it refers if the appropriate 
TTB officer finds that this is necessary in order to prevent confusion 
as to the person, company, or brand name to which the establishment date 
is applicable.
    (e) Simulation of Government stamps. (1) No labels shall be of such 
design as to resemble or simulate a stamp of the United States 
Government or any State or foreign government. No label, other than 
stamps authorized or required by the United States Government or any 
State or foreign government, shall state or indicate that the wine 
contained in the labeled container is produced, blended, bottled, 
packed, or sold under, or in accordance with, any municipal, State or 
Federal Government authorization, law, or regulation, unless such 
statement is required or specifically authorized by Federal, State or 
municipal law or regulation, or is required or specifically authorized 
by the laws or regulations of a foreign country. If the municipal, 
State, or Federal Government permit number is stated upon a label, it 
shall not be accompanied by any additional statement relating thereto.
    (2) Bonded wine cellar and bonded winery numbers may be stated but 
only in direct conjunction with the name and address of the person 
operating such wine cellar or winery. Statement of bonded wine cellar or 
winery numbers may be made in the following form: ``Bonded Wine Cellar 
No. ----'', ``Bonded Winery No. ----'', ``B. W. C. No. ----'', ``B. W. 
No. ----''. No additional reference thereto shall be made, nor shall any 
use be made of such statement that may convey the impression that the 
wine has been made or matured under Government supervision or in 
accordance with Government specifications or standards.
    (3) If imported wines are covered by a certificate of origin and/or 
a certificate of vintage date issued by a duly authorized official of 
the appropriate foreign government, the label, except where prohibited 
by the foreign government, may refer to such certificate or the fact of 
such certification, but shall not be accompanied by any additional

[[Page 36]]

statements relating thereto. The reference to such certificate or 
certification shall be substantially in the following form:

    This product accompanied at the time of the importation by a 
certificate issued by the
________________________________________________________________________

                          (Name of government)

    government indicating that the product is
________________________________________________________________________

                 (Class and type as stated on the label)

    and (if label bears a statement of vintage date) that the wine is of 
the vintage of
________________________________________________________________________

                  (Year of vintage stated on the label)

    (f) Use of the word ``Importer'', or similar words. The word 
Importer, or similar words, shall not be stated on labels on containers 
of domestic wine except as part of the bona fide name of a permittee for 
or by whom, or of a retailer for whom, such wine is bottled, packed or 
distributed: Provided, That in all cases where such words are used as 
part of such name, there shall be stated on the same label the words 
``Product of the United States'', or similar words to negative any 
impression that the product is imported, and such negative statement 
shall appear in the same size and kind of printing as such name.
    (g) Flags, seals, coats of arms, crests, and other insignia. Labels 
shall not contain, in the brand name or otherwise, any statement, 
design, device, or pictorial representation which the appropriate TTB 
officer finds relates to, or is capable of being construed as relating 
to, the armed forces of the United States, or the American flag, or any 
emblem, seal, insignia, or decoration associated with such flag or armed 
forces; nor shall any label contain any statement, design, device, or 
pictorial representation of or concerning any flag, seal, coat of arms, 
crest or other insignia, likely to mislead the consumer to believe that 
the product has been endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or 
under the supervision of, or in accordance with the specifications of 
the government, organization, family, or individual with whom such flag, 
seal, coat of arms, crest, or insignia is associated.
    (h) Health-related statements--(1) Definitions. When used in this 
paragraph (h), terms are defined as follows:
    (i) Health-related statement means any statement related to health 
(other than the warning statement required by Sec. 16.21 of this 
chapter) and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature 
that, expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the 
consumption of alcohol, wine, or any substance found within the wine, 
and health benefits or effects on health. The term includes both 
specific health claims and general references to alleged health benefits 
or effects on health associated with the consumption of alcohol, wine, 
or any substance found within the wine, as well as health-related 
directional statements. The term also includes statements and claims 
that imply that a physical or psychological sensation results from 
consuming the wine, as well as statements and claims of nutritional 
value (e.g., statements of vitamin content). Statements concerning 
caloric, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content do not constitute 
nutritional claims about the product.
    (ii) Specific health claim is a type of health-related statement 
that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the 
wine, alcohol, or any substance found within the wine, to a disease or 
health-related condition. Implied specific health claims include 
statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that 
suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a 
relationship exists between wine, alcohol, or any substance found within 
the wine, and a disease or health-related condition.
    (iii) Health-related directional statement is a type of health-
related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or 
other source for information regarding the effects on health of wine or 
alcohol consumption.
    (2) Rules for labeling--(i) Health-related statements. In general, 
labels may not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in 
any particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the 
effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will evaluate such 
statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part of the

[[Page 37]]

health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying statement 
to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related 
statement.
    (ii) Specific health claims. (A) TTB will consult with the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), as needed, on the use of a specific health 
claim on a wine label. If FDA determines that the use of such a labeling 
claim is a drug claim that is not in compliance with the requirements of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, TTB will not approve the use 
of that specific health claim on a wine label.
    (B) TTB will approve the use of a specific health claim on a wine 
label only if the claim is truthful and adequately substantiated by 
scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed and qualified with 
respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; 
adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and 
heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of 
individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health 
risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health 
claim.
    (iii) Health-related directional statements. A statement that 
directs consumers to a third party or other source for information 
regarding the effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption is 
presumed misleading unless it--
    (A) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to 
a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the 
effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption; and
    (B)(1) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement 
the following disclaimer: ``This statement should not encourage you to 
drink or to increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons;'' or
    (2) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement 
some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds 
is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the 
health-related directional statement.
    (i) Geographic brand names. (1) Except as provided in subparagraph 
2, a brand name of viticultural significance may not be used unless the 
wine meets the appellation of origin requirements for the geographic 
area named.
    (2) For brand names used in existing certificates of label approval 
issued prior to July 7, 1986:
    (i) The wine shall meet the appellation of origin requirements for 
the geographic area named; or
    (ii) The wine shall be labeled with an appellation of origin in 
accordance with Sec. 4.34(b) as to location and size of type of either:
    (A) A county or a viticultural area, if the brand name bears the 
name of a geographic area smaller than a state, or;
    (B) A state, county or a viticultural area, if the brand name bears 
a state name; or
    (iii) The wine shall be labeled with some other statement which the 
appropriate TTB officer finds to be sufficient to dispel the impression 
that the geographic area suggested by the brand name is indicative of 
the origin of the wine.
    (3) A name has viticultural significance when it is the name of a 
state or county (or the foreign equivalents), when approved as a 
viticultural area in part 9 of this chapter, or by a foreign government, 
or when found to have viticultural significance by the appropriate TTB 
officer.
    (j) Product names of geographical significance (not mandatory before 
January 1, 1983). The use of product names with specific geographical 
significance is prohibited unless the appropriate TTB officer finds that 
because of their long usage, such names are recognized by consumers as 
fanciful product names and not representations as to origin. In such 
cases the product names shall be qualified with the word ``brand'' 
immediately following the product name, in the same size of type, and as 
conspicuous as the product name itself. In addition, the label shall 
bear an appellation of origin under the provisions of Sec. 4.34(b), 
and, if required by the appropriate TTB officer, a statement disclaiming 
the geographical reference as a representation as to the origin of the 
wine.
    (k) Other indications of origin. Other statements, designs, devices 
or representations which indicate or infer an origin other than the true 
place of origin of the wine are prohibited.

[[Page 38]]

    (l) Foreign terms. Foreign terms which: (1) Describe a particular 
condition of the grapes at the time of harvest (such as ``Auslese,'' 
``Eiswein,'' and ``Trockenbeerenauslese''); or (2) denote quality under 
foreign law (such as ``Qualitatswein'' and ``Kabinett'') may not be used 
on the labels of American wine.
    (m) Use of a vineyard, orchard, farm or ranch name. When used in a 
brand name, a vineyard, orchard, farm or ranch name having geographical 
or viticultural significance is subject to the requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 4.33(b) and 4.39(i) of this part. Additionally, the name of a 
vineyard, orchard, farm or ranch shall not be used on a wine label, 
unless 95 percent of the wine in the container was produced from primary 
winemaking material grown on the named vineyard, orchard, farm or ranch.
    (n) Use of a varietal name, type designation of varietal 
significance, semi-generic name, or geographic distinctive designation. 
Labels that contain in the brand name, product name, or distinctive or 
fanciful name, any varietal (grape type) designation, type designation 
of varietal significance, semi-generic geographic type designation, or 
geographic distinctive designation, are misleading unless the wine is 
made in accordance with the standards prescribed in classes 1, 2, or 3 
of Sec. 4.21. Any other use of such a designation on other than a class 
1, 2, or 3 wine is presumed misleading.

   Subpart E_Requirements for Withdrawal of Wine From Customs Custody


<R05>
Sec. 4.40  Label approval and release.

    (a) Certificate of label approval. No imported beverage wine in 
containers shall be released from U.S. Customs custody for consumption 
unless there is deposited with the appropriate Customs officer at the 
port of entry the original or a photostatic copy of an approved 
certificate of label approval, TTB Form 5100.31.
    (b) If the original or photostatic copy of TTB Form 5100.31 has been 
approved, the brand or lot of imported wine bearing labels identical 
with those shown thereon may be released from U.S. Customs custody.
    (c) Relabeling. Imported wine in U.S. Customs custody which is not 
labeled in conformity with certificates of label approval issued by the 
appropriate TTB officer must be relabeled prior to release under the 
supervision and direction of Customs officers of the port at which the 
wine is located.
    (d) Cross reference. For procedures regarding the issuance, denial, 
and revocation of certificates of label approval, as well as appeal 
procedures, see part 13 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 4.45  Certificates of origin, identity and proper cellar treatment.

    (a) Origin and identity. Imported wine shall not be released from 
customs custody for consumption unless the invoice is accompanied by a 
certificate of origin issued by a duly authorized official of the 
appropriate foreign government, if the issuance of such certificates 
with respect to such wine has been authorized by the foreign government 
concerned, certifying as to the identity of the wine and that the wine 
has been produced in compliance with the laws of the respective foreign 
government regulating the production of such wine for home consumption.
    (b) Certification of proper cellar treatment of natural wine--(1) 
General. An importer of wine may be required to have in his or her 
possession at the time of release of the wine from customs custody a 
certification or may have to comply with other conditions prescribed in 
Sec. 27.140 of this chapter regarding proper cellar treatment. If 
imported wine requires a certification under Sec. 27.140, the importer 
must provide a copy of that certification to TTB as follows:
    (i) The importer must attach a copy of the certification to the 
application

[[Page 39]]

for a certificate of label approval for the wine in question submitted 
under Sec. 13.21 of this chapter; or
    (ii) If a certification for the wine in question was not available 
when the importer submitted the application for label approval, the 
importer must submit a copy of the certification to the appropriate TTB 
officer prior to release from customs custody of the first shipment of 
the wine.
    (2) Validity of certification. A certification submitted under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section is valid as long as the wine is of the 
same brand and class or type, was made by the same producer, was 
subjected to the same cellar treatment, and conforms to the statements 
made on the certification. Accordingly, if the cellar treatment of the 
wine changes and a new certification under Sec. 27.140 is required, an 
importer is required to submit a new certification for the wine even 
though it is subject to the same label approval.
    (3) Use of certification. TTB may use the information from a 
certification for purposes of verifying the appropriate class and type 
designation of the wine under the labeling provisions of this part. TTB 
will make certifications submitted under paragraph (b)(1) of this

<R05>
Sec. 4.64  Prohibited practices.

    (a) Restrictions. The advertisement of wine shall not contain:
    (1) Any statement that is false or untrue in any material 
particular, or that, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, 
omission, or inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific or 
technical matter tends to create a misleading impression.
    (2) Any statement that is disparaging of a competitor's products.
    (3) Any statement, design, device, or representation which is 
obscene or indecent.
    (4) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating 
to analyses, standards, or tests, irrespective of falsity, which the 
appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer.
    (5) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating 
to any guarantee, irrespective of falsity, which the appropriate TTB 
officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer. Money-back 
guarantees are not prohibited.
    (6) Any statement that the wine is produced, blended, bottled, 
packed, or sold under, or in accordance with, any municipal, State, or 
Federal Government authorization, law, or regulations; and if a 
municipal, State, or Federal permit number is stated, the permit number 
shall not be accompanied by any additional statement relating thereto.
    (7) Any statement of bonded winecellar and bonded winery numbers 
unless stated in direct conjunction with the name and address of the 
person operating such winery or storeroom. Statement of bonded 
winecellar and bonded winery numbers may be made in the following form: 
``Bonded Winecellar No. ----,'' ``Bonded Winery No. ----,'' ``B. W. C. 
No. ----,'' ``B. W. No. ----.'' No additional reference thereto shall be 
made, nor shall any use be made of such statement that may convey the 
impression that the wine has been made or matured under Government 
supervision or in accordance with Government specifications or 
standards.
    (8) Any statement, design, device, or representation which relates 
to alcohol content or which tends to create the impression that a wine:
    (i) Contains distilled spirits; or
    (ii) Is comparable to a distilled spirit; or
    (iii) Has intoxicating qualities.

However, if a statement of composition is required to appear as the 
designation of a product not defined in these regulations, such 
statement of composition may include a reference to the type of 
distilled spirits contained therein. Further, an approved wine label, 
which bears the statement of alcohol content may be depicted in any 
advertising media, or an actual wine bottle showing the approved label 
bearing the statement of alcoholic content may be displayed in any 
advertising media.

[[Page 42]]

    (9) Any word in the brand name or class and type designation which 
is the name of a distilled spirits product or which simulates, imitates, 
or creates the impression that the wine so labeled is, or is similar to, 
any product customarily made with a distilled spirits base.
    (b) Statements inconsistent with labeling. (1) Advertisements shall 
not contain any statement concerning a brand or lot of wine that is 
inconsistent with any statement on the labeling thereof.
    (2) Any label depicted on a bottle in an advertisement shall be a 
reproduction of an approved label.
    (c) Statement of age. No statement of age or representation relative 
to age (including words or devices in any brand name or mark) shall be 
made, except (1) for vintage wine, in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 4.27; (2) references in accordance with Sec. 4.38(f); or (3) use 
of the word ``old'' as part of a brand name.
    (d) Statement of bottling dates. The statement of any bottling date 
shall not be deemed to be a representation relative to age, if such 
statement appears without undue emphasis in the following form: 
``Bottled in ----'' (inserting the year in which the wine was bottled).
    (e) Statement of miscellaneous dates. No date, except as provided in 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, with respect to statement of 
vintage year and bottling date, shall be stated unless, in addition 
thereto, and in direct conjunction therewith, in the same size and kind 
of printing there shall be stated an explanation of the significance of 
such date: Provided, That if any date refers to the date of 
establishment of any business, such date shall be stated without undue 
emphasis and in direct conjunction with the name of the person to whom 
it refers.
    (f) Flags, seals, coats of arms, crests, and other insignia. No 
advertisement shall contain any statement, design, device, or pictorial 
representation of or relating to, or capable of being construed as 
relating to, the armed forces of the United States, or of the American 
flag, or of any emblem, seal, insignia, or decoration associated with 
such flag or armed forces; nor shall any advertisement contain any 
statement, device, design, or pictorial representation of or concerning 
any flag, seal, coat of arms, crest, or other insignia likely to mislead 
the consumer to believe that the product has been endorsed, made, or 
used by, or produced for, or under the supervision of, or in accordance 
with the specifications of the government, organization, family, or 
individual with whom such flag, seal, coat of arms, crests, or insignia 
is associated.
    (g) Statements indicative of origin. No statement, design, device, 
or representation which tends to create the impression that the wine 
originated in a particular place or region, shall appear in any 
advertisement unless the label of the advertised product bears an 
appellation of origin, and such appellation of origin appears in the 
advertisement in direct conjunction with the class and type designation.
    (h) Use of the word ``importer'' or similar words. The word importer 
or similar words shall not appear in advertisements of domestic wine 
except as part of the bona fide name of the permittee by or for whom, or 
of a retailer for whom, such wine is bottled, packed or distributed: 
Provided, That in all cases where such words are used as part of such 
name, there shall be stated the words ``Product of the United States'' 
or similar words to negate any impression that the product is imported, 
and such negating statements shall appear in the same size and kind of 
printing as such name.
    (i) Health-related statements--(1) Definitions. When used in this 
paragraph (i), terms are defined as follows:
    (i) Health-related statement means any statement related to health 
and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature that, 
expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the 
consumption of alcohol, wine, or any substance found within the wine, 
and health benefits or effects on health. The term includes both 
specific health claims and general references to alleged health benefits 
or effects on health associated with the consumption of alcohol, wine, 
or any substance found within the wine, as well as health-related 
directional statements. The term also includes statements and claims 
that imply that

[[Page 43]]

a physical or psychological sensation results from consuming the wine, 
as well as statements and claims of nutritional value (e.g., statements 
of vitamin content). Statements concerning caloric, carbohydrate, 
protein, and fat content do not constitute nutritional claims about the 
product.
    (ii) Specific health claim is a type of health-related statement 
that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the 
wine, alcohol, or any substance found within the wine, to a disease or 
health-related condition. Implied specific health claims include 
statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that 
suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a 
relationship exists between wine, alcohol, or any substance found within 
the wine, and a disease or health-related condition.
    (iii) Health-related directional statement is a type of health-
related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or 
other source for information regarding the effects on health of wine or 
alcohol consumption.
    (2) Rules for advertising--(i) Health-related statements. In 
general, advertisements may not contain any health-related statement 
that is untrue in any particular or tends to create a misleading 
impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will 
evaluate such statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part 
of the health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying 
statement to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-
related statement. Such disclaimer or other qualifying statement must 
appear as prominent as the health-related statement.
    (ii) Specific health claims. A specific health claim will not be 
considered misleading if it is truthful and adequately substantiated by 
scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed and qualified with 
respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; 
adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and 
heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of 
individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health 
risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim 
and in a manner as prominent as the specific health claim.
    (iii) Health-related directional statements. A statement that 
directs consumers to a third party or other source for information 
regarding the effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption is 
presumed misleading unless it--
    (A) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to 
a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the 
effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption; and
    (B)(1) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, 
and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional 
statement, the following disclaimer: ``This statement should not 
encourage you to drink or increase your alcohol consumption for health 
reasons;'' or
    (2) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, 
and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional 
statement, some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB 
officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed 
by the health-related directional statement.
    (j) Confusion of brands. Two or more different brands or lots of 
wine shall not be advertised in one advertisement (or in two or more 
advertisements in one issue of a periodical or newspaper, or in one 
piece of other written, printed, or graphic matter) if the advertisement 
tends to create the impression that representations made as to one brand 
or lot apply to the other or others, and if as to such latter the 
representations contravene any provision of Sec. Sec. 4.60 through 4.64 
or are in any respect untrue.
    (k) Deceptive advertising techniques. Subliminal or similar 
techniques are prohibited. ``Subliminal or similar techniques,'' as used 
in this part, refers to any device or technique that is used to convey, 
or attempts to convey, a message to a person by means of images or 
sounds of a very brief nature

[[Page 44]]

that cannot be perceived at a normal level of awareness.

advertisements comparing competitors' products unless they are 
disparaging, deceptive, or likely to mislead the consumer.
    (2) The taste test procedure used shall meet scientifically accepted 
procedures. An example of a scientifically accepted procedure is 
outlined in the Manual on Sensory Testing Methods, ASTM Special 
Technical Publication 434, published by the American Society for Testing 
and Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, ASTM,

          Subpart C_Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits


<R05>
Sec. 5.21  Application of standards.

    The standards of identity for the several classes and types of 
distilled spirits set forth in this part shall be applicable only to 
distilled spirits for beverage or other nonindustrial purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 5.22  The standards of identity.

    Standards of identity for the several classes and types of distilled 
spirits set forth in this section shall be as follows (see also Sec. 
5.35, class and type):
    (a) Class 1; neutral spirits or alcohol. ``Neutral spirits'' or 
``alcohol'' are distilled spirits produced from any material at or above 
190[deg] proof, and, if bottled, bottled at not less than 80[deg] proof.
    (1) ``Vodka'' is neutral spirits so distilled, or so treated after 
distillation with charcoal or other materials, as to be without 
distinctive character, aroma, taste, or color.
    (2) ``Grain spirits'' are neutral spirits distilled from a fermented 
mash of grain and stored in oak containers.
    (b) Class 2; whisky. ``Whisky'' is an alcoholic distillate from a 
fermented mash of grain produced at less than 190[deg] proof in such 
manner that the distillate possesses the taste, aroma, and 
characteristics generally attributed to whisky, stored in oak containers 
(except that corn whisky need not be so stored), and bottled at not less 
than 80[deg] proof, and also includes mixtures of such distillates for 
which no specific standards of identity are prescribed.
    (1)(i) ``Bourbon whisky'', ``rye whisky'', ``wheat whisky'', ``malt 
whisky'', or ``rye malt whisky'' is whisky produced at not exceeding 
160[deg] proof from a fermented mash of not less than 51 percent corn, 
rye, wheat, malted barley, or malted rye grain, respectively, and stored 
at not more than 125[deg] proof in charred new oak containers; and also 
includes mixtures of such whiskies of the same type.
    (ii) ``Corn whisky'' is whisky produced at not exceeding 160[deg] 
proof from a fermented mash of not less than 80 percent corn grain, and 
if stored in oak containers stored at not more than 125[deg] proof in 
used or uncharred new oak containers and not subjected in any manner to 
treatment with charred wood; and also includes mixtures of such whisky.
    (iii) Whiskies conforming to the standards prescribed in paragraphs 
(b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, which have been stored in the type 
of oak containers prescribed, for a period of 2 years or more shall be 
further designated as ``straight''; for example, ``straight bourbon 
whisky'', ``straight corn whisky'', and whisky conforming to the 
standards prescribed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, except that 
it was produced from a fermented mash of less than 51 percent of any one 
type of grain, and stored for a period of 2 years or more in charred new 
oak containers shall be designated merely as ``straight whisky''. No 
other whiskies may be designated ``straight''. ``Straight whisky'' 
includes mixtures of straight whiskies of the same type produced in the 
same State.
    (2) ``Whisky distilled from bourbon (rye, wheat, malt, or rye malt) 
mash'' is whisky produced in the United States at not exceeding 160[deg] 
proof from a fermented mash of not less than 51 percent corn, rye, 
wheat, malted barley, or malted rye grain, respectively, and stored in 
used oak containers; and also includes mixtures of such whiskies of the 
same type. Whisky conforming to the standard of identity for corn whisky 
must be designated corn whisky.

[[Page 53]]

whisky'' is mixed with less than 20 percent of straight whisky on a 
proof gallon basis, the mixture shall be designated ``blended light 
whisky'' (light whisky--a blend).
    (4) ``Blended whisky'' (whisky--a blend) is a mixture which contains 
straight whisky or a blend of straight whiskies at not less than 20 
percent on a proof gallon basis, excluding alcohol derived from added 
harmless coloring, flavoring or blending materials, and, separately, or 
in combination, whisky or neutral spirits. A blended whisky containing 
not less than 51 percent on a proof gallon basis of one of the types of 
straight whisky shall be further designated by that specific type of 
straight whisky; for example, ``blended rye whisky'' (rye whisky--a 
blend).

of identify for ``straight whisky.'' Products so designated may contain 
harmless coloring, flavoring, or blending materials as set forth in 27 
CFR 5.23(a).
    (ii) ``A blend of straight whiskies'' (blended straight whiskies) 
consisting entirely of one of the types of straight whisky, and not 
conforming to the standard for straight whisky, shall be further 
designated by that specific type of straight whisky; for example, ``a 
blend of straight rye whiskies'' (blended straight rye whiskies). ``A 
blend of straight whiskies'' consisting entirely of one of the types of 
straight whisky shall include straight whisky of the same type which was 
produced in the same State or by the same proprietor within the same 
State, provided that such whisky contains harmless coloring, flavoring, 
or blending materials as stated in 27 CFR 5.23(a).

percolations, or maceration of such materials, and includes mixtures of 
gin and neutral spirits. It shall derive its main characteristic flavor 
from juniper berries and be bottled at not less than 80[deg] proof. Gin 
produced exclusively by original distillation or by redistillation may 
be further designated as ``distilled''. ``Dry gin'' (London dry gin), 
``Geneva gin'' (Hollands gin), and ``Old Tom gin'' (Tom gin) are types 
of gin known under such designations.

the addition of water to facilitate fermentation or distillation). Fruit 
brandy shall include mixtures of such brandy with not more than 30 
percent (calculated on a proof gallon basis) of lees brandy. Fruit 
brandy, derived from grapes, shall be designated as ``grape brandy'' or 
``brandy'', except that in the case of brandy (other than neutral 
brandy, pomace brandy, marc brandy or grappa brandy) distilled from the 
fermented juice, mash, or wine of grapes, or the residue thereof, which 
has been stored in oak containers for less than 2 years, the statement 
of class and type shall be immediately preceded, in the same size and 
kind of type, by the word ``immature''. Fruit brandy, other than grape 
brandy, derived from one variety of fruit, shall be designated by the 
word ``brandy'' qualified by the name of such fruit (for example, 
``peach brandy''), except that ``apple brandy'' may be designated

conforms to any of the standards set forth in paragraphs (d) (1), (3), 
(4), and (5) of this section may, regardless of such fact, be designated 
``residue brandy'', but the use of such designation shall be conclusive, 
precluding any later change of designation.
    (7) ``Neutral brandy'' is brandy produced at more than 170[deg] 
proof and shall be designated in accordance with the standards in this

designation thereof, the word ``imitation'' and shall include the 
following:
    (1) Any class or type of distilled spirits to which has been added 
coloring or flavoring material of such nature as to cause the resultant 
product to simulate any other class or type of distilled spirits;

any other place than the particular region indicated by the name, unless 
(i) in direct conjunction with the name there appears the word ``type'' 
or the word ``American'' or some other adjective indicating the true 
place of production, in lettering substantially as conspicuous as such 
name, and (ii) the distilled spirits to which the name is applied 
conform to the distilled spirits of that particular region. The 
following are examples of distinctive types of distilled spirits with 
geographical names that have not become generic: Eau de Vie de Dantzig 
(Danziger Goldwasser), Ojen, Swedish punch. Geographical names for 
distinctive types of distilled spirits shall be used to designate only 
distilled spirits conforming to the standard of identity, if any, for 
such type specified in this section, or if no such standard is so 
specified, then in accordance with the trade understanding of that 
distinctive type.

[[Page 57]]

    (2) Only such geographical names for distilled spirits as the 
appropriate TTB officer finds have by usage and common knowledge lost 
their geographical significance to such extent that they have become 
generic shall be deemed to have become generic. Examples at London dry 
gin, Geneva (Hollands) gin.
    (3) Geographical names that are not names for distinctive types of

distinctive of a particular place. (1) The whiskies of the types 
specified in paragraphs (b) (1), (4), (5), and (6) of this section are 
distinctive products of the United States and if produced in a foreign 
country shall be designated by the applicable designation prescribed in 
such paragraphs, together with the words ``American type'' or the words 
``produced (distilled, blended) in ----'', the blank to be filled in 
with the name of the foreign country: Provided, That the word 
``bourbon'' shall not be used to describe any whisky or whisky-based 
distilled spirits not produced in the United States. If whisky of any of 
these types is composed in part of whisky or whiskies produced in a 
foreign country there shall be stated, on the brand label, the 
percentage of such whisky and the country of origin thereof.
    (2) The name for other distilled spirits which are distinctive 
products of a particular place or country, an example is Habanero, shall 
not be given to the product of any other place or country unless the 
designation for such product includes the word ``type'' or an adjective 
such as ``American'', or the like, clearly indicating the true place of 
production. The provision for place of production shall not apply to 
designations which by usage and common knowledge have lost their 
geographical significance to such an extent that the appropriate TTB 
officer finds they have become generic. Examples are Slivovitz, 
Zubrovka, Aquavit, Arrack, and Kirschwasser.

Sec. 5.23  Alteration of class and type.

    (a) Additions. (1) The addition of any coloring, flavoring, or 
blending materials to any class and type of distilled spirits, except as 
otherwise provided in this section, alters the class and type thereof 
and the product shall be appropriately redesignated.
    (2) There may be added to any class or type of distilled spirits, 
without changing the class or type thereof, (i) such harmless coloring, 
flavoring, or blending materials as are an essential component part of 
the particular class or type of distilled spirits to which added, and 
(ii) harmless coloring, flavoring, or blending materials such as 
caramel, straight malt or straight rye malt whiskies, fruit juices, 
sugar, infusion of oak chips when approved by the Administrator, or 
wine, which are not an essential component part of the particular 
distilled spirits to which added, but which are customarily employed 
therein in accordance with established trade usage, if such coloring, 
flavoring, or blending materials do not total more than 2\1/2\ percent 
by volume of the finished product.
    (3) ``Harmless coloring, flavoring, and blending materials'' shall 
not include (i) any material which would render the product to which it 
is added an imitation, or (ii) any material, other than caramel, 
infusion of oak chips, and sugar, in the case of Cognac brandy; or (iii) 
any material whatsoever in the case of neutral spirits or straight 
whiskey, except that vodka may be treated with sugar in an amount not to 
exceed 2 grams per liter and a trace amount of citric acid.

constituents to

[[Page 58]]

such an extent that the product does not possess the taste, aroma, and 
characteristics generally attributed to that class or type of distilled 
spirits alters the class and type thereof, and the product shall be 
appropriately redesignated. In addition, in the case of straight whisky 
the removal of more than 15 percent of the fixed acids, or volatile 
acids, or esters, or soluble solids, or higher alcohols, or more than 25 
percent of the soluble color, shall be deemed to alter the class or type 
thereof.
    (c) Exceptions. (1) This section shall not be construed as in any 
manner modifying the standards of identity for cordials and liqueurs, 
flavored brandy, flavored gin, flavored rum, flavored vodka, and 
flavored whisky or as authorizing any product which is defined in Sec. 
5.22(j), Class 10, as an imitation to be otherwise designated.

Sec. 5.32a  Voluntary disclosure of major food allergens.

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section the following terms 
have the meanings indicated.
    (1) Major food allergen. Major food allergen means any of the 
following:
    (i) Milk, egg, fish (for example, bass, flounder, or cod), 
Crustacean shellfish (for example, crab, lobster, or shrimp),

[[Page 61]]

tree nuts (for example, almonds, pecans, or walnuts), wheat, peanuts, 
and soybeans; or
    (ii) A food ingredient that contains protein derived from a food 
specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, except:
    (A) Any highly refined oil derived from a food specified in 
paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section and any ingredient derived from such 
highly refined oil; or
    (B) A food ingredient that is exempt from major food allergen 
labeling requirements pursuant to a petition for exemption approved by 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under 21 U.S.C. 343(w)(6) or 
pursuant to a notice submitted to FDA under 21 U.S.C. 343(w)(7), 
provided that the food ingredient meets the terms or conditions, if any, 
specified for that exemption.
    (2) Name of the food source from which each major food allergen is 
derived. Name of the food source from which each major food allergen is 
derived means the name of the food as listed in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of 
this section, except that:
    (i) In the case of a tree nut, it means the name of the specific 
type of nut (for example, almonds, pecans, or walnuts);
    (ii) In the case of Crustacean shellfish, it means the name of the 
species of Crustacean shellfish (for example, crab, lobster, or shrimp); 
and
    (iii) The names ``egg'' and ``peanuts'', as well as the names of the 
different types of tree nuts, may be expressed in either the singular or 
plural form, and the term ``soy'', soybean'', or ``soya'' may be used 
instead of ``soybeans''.
    (b) Voluntary labeling standards. Major food allergens (defined in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section) used in the production of a distilled 
spirit product may, on a voluntary basis, be declared on any label 
affixed to the container. However, if any one major food allergen is 
voluntarily declared, all major food allergens used in production of the 
distilled spirit product, including major food allergens used as fining 
or processing agents, must be declared, except when covered by a 
petition for exemption approved by the appropriate TTB officer under 
Sec. 5.32b. The major food allergens declaration must consist of the 
word ``Contains'' followed by a colon and the name of the food source 
from which each major food allergen is derived (for example, ``Contains: 
egg'').
    (c) Cross reference. For mandatory labeling requirements applicable 
to distilled spirits products containing FD&C Yellow No. 5 and sulfites, 
see Sec. Sec. 5.32(b)(5) and (7).

[T.D. TTB-53, 71 FR 42268, July 26, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 5.32b  Petitions for exemption from major food allergen labeling.

    (a) Submission of petition. Any person may petition the appropriate 
TTB officer to exempt a particular product or class of products from the 
labeling requirements of Sec. 5.32a. The burden is on the petitioner to 
provide scientific evidence (including the analytical method used to 
produce the evidence) that demonstrates that the finished product or 
class of products, as derived by the method specified in the petition, 
either:
    (1) Does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human 
health; or
    (2) Does not contain allergenic protein derived from one of the 
foods identified in Sec. 5.32a(a)(1)(i), even though a major food 
allergen was used in production.
    (b) Decision on petition. TTB will approve or deny a petition for 
exemption submitted under paragraph (a) of this section in writing 
within 180 days of receipt of the petition. If TTB does not provide a 
written response to the petitioner within that 180-day period, the 
petition will be deemed denied, unless an extension of time for decision 
is mutually agreed upon by the appropriate TTB officer and the 
petitioner. TTB may confer with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
on petitions for exemption, as appropriate and as FDA resources permit. 
TTB may require the submission of product samples and other additional 
information in support of a petition; however, unless required by TTB, 
the submission of samples or additional information by the petitioner 
after submission of the petition will be treated as the withdrawal of 
the initial petition and the submission of a new petition. An approval 
or denial under this section will constitute a final agency action.

[[Page 62]]

    (c) Resubmission of a petition. After a petition for exemption is 
denied under this section, the petitioner may resubmit the petition 
along with supporting materials for reconsideration at any time. TTB 
will treat this submission as a new petition for purposes of the time 
frames for decision set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Availability of information--(1) General. TTB will promptly post 
to its public Web site, http://www.ttb.gov, all petitions received under 
this section as well as TTB's responses to those petitions. Any 
information submitted in support of the petition that is not posted to 
the TTB Web site will be available to the public pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552, except where a request for confidential treatment is granted under 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (2) Requests for confidential treatment of business information. A 
person who provides trade secrets or other commercial or financial 
information in connection with a petition for exemption under this 
section may request that TTB give confidential treatment to that 
information. A failure to request confidential treatment at the time the 
information in question is submitted to TTB will constitute a waiver of 
confidential treatment. A request for confidential treatment of 
information under this section must conform to the following standards:
    (i) The request must be in writing;
    (ii) The request must clearly identify the information to be kept 
confidential;
    (iii) The request must relate to information that constitutes trade 
secrets or other confidential commercial or financial information 
regarding the business transactions of an interested person, the 
disclosure of which would cause substantial harm to the competitive 
position of that person;
    (iv) The request must set forth the reasons why the information 
should not be disclosed, including the reasons the disclosure of the 
information would prejudice the competitive position of the interested 
person; and
    (v) The request must be supported by a signed statement by the 
interested person, or by an authorized officer or employee of that 
person, certifying that the information in question is a trade secret or 
other confidential commercial or financial information and that the 
information is not already in the public domain.

Sec. 5.33  Additional requirements.

    (a) Contrasting background. Labels shall be so designed that the 
statements required by this subpart are readily legible under ordinary 
conditions, and such statements shall be on a contrasting background.
    (b) Location of statements and size of type. (1) Statements required 
by this subpart, except brand names, shall appear generally parallel to 
the base on which the bottle rests as it is designed to be displayed or 
shall be otherwise equally conspicuous.
    (2) Statements required by this subpart, except brand names and the 
declaration of sulfites in Sec. 5.32(b)(7), shall be separate and apart 
from any other descriptive or explanatory matters.
    (3) If not separate and apart from other descriptive or explanatory 
matter printed on the label, the statement declaring the presence of 
sulfites shall be of a size substantially more conspicuous than 
surrounding nonmandatory labeling information.
    (4) Statements of the type of distilled spirits shall be as 
conspicuous as the statement of the class to which it refers, and in 
direct conjunction therewith.
    (5) Statements required by this subpart, except brand names, shall 
be in script, type, or printing not smaller than 2 millimeters (or 8-
point gothic until January 1, 1983), except that, in the case of labels 
on bottles of 200 milliliters or less capacity, such script, type, or 
printing shall not be smaller than 1 millimeter (or 6-point gothic until 
January 1, 1983).
    (6) When net contents are stated either in metric measures or in 
both metric and U.S. fluid measures, statements required by the subpart, 
except brand names, shall be in script, type, or printing not smaller 
than 2 millimeters (or 8-point gothic until January 1, 1983), except

[[Page 63]]

(or 6-point gothic until January 1, 1983).
    (c) English language. The requirements of this subpart shall be 
stated in the English language, except that the brand name need not be

be obscured thereby. Labels shall not obscure any markings or 
information required to be permanently marked in the bottle by other 
U.S. Treasury Department regulations.
    (e) Labels firmly affixed. Labels which are not an integral part of 
the bottle shall be affixed to bottles in such manner that they cannot 
be removed without thorough application of water or other solvents.
    (f) Additional information on labels. Labels may contain information 
other than the mandatory label information required by this subpart if 
the information does not conflict with, or in any manner qualify, 
statements required by this part.
    (g) Contents of bottles. A complete and accurate statement of the 
contents of the bottles to which labels are to be or have been affixed 
shall be submitted, on request, to the appropriate TTB officer.

<R05>
Sec. 5.34  Brand names.

    (a) Misleading brand names. No label shall contain any brand name, 
which, standing alone, or in association with other printed or graphic 
matter, creates any impression or inference as to the age, origin, 
identity, or other characteristics of the product unless the appropriate 
TTB officer finds that such brand name (when appropriately qualified if 
required) conveys no erroneous impressions as to the age, origin, 
identity, or other characteristics of the product.
    (b) Trade name of foreign origin. Paragraph (a) of this section does 
not prohibit the use by any person of any trade name or brand of foreign 
origin not effectively registered in the U.S. Patent Office on August 
29, 1935, which has been used by such person or his predecessors in the 
United States for a period of at least 5 years immediately preceding 
August 29, 1935: Provided, That if such trade name or brand is used, the 
designation of the product shall be qualified by the name of the 
locality in the United States in which produced, and such qualification 
shall be in script, type, or printing as conspicuous as the trade name 
or brand.


<R05>
Sec. 5.35  Class and type.

    (a) Designation of product. The class and type of distilled spirits 
shall be stated in conformity with Sec. 5.22 if defined therein. In all 
other instances the product shall be designated in accordance with trade 
and consumer understanding thereof, or, if no such understanding exists, 
by a distinctive or fanciful name, and in either case (except as 
provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) followed by a truthful and 
adequate statement of composition. The word ``cordial'' or ``liqueur'' 
need not be stated in the case of cordials and liqueurs unless the 
appropriate TTB officer finds such word is necessary to clearly indicate 
that the product is a cordial or liqueur.
    (b) Products designed in accordance with trade and consumer 
understanding. In the case of products designated in accordance with 
trade and consumer understanding:
    (1) A statement of the classes and types of distilled spirits used 
in the manufacture thereof shall be deemed a sufficient statement of 
composition in the case of highballs, cocktails, and similar prepared 
specialties when the designation adequately indicates to the consumer 
the general character of the product.
    (2) No statement of composition is required if the designation 
through general and established usage adequately indicates to the 
consumer the composition of the product.

A product shall not bear a designation which indicates it contains a 
class or

[[Page 64]]

type of distilled spirits unless the distilled spirits therein conform 
to such class and type.
    (c) Origin of whiskies in mixtures. In the case of any of the types 
of whisky defined in Sec. 5.22(b), Class 2, which contains any whisky 
or whiskies produced in a country other than that indicated by the type 
designation, there shall be stated on the brand label the percentage of 
such whisky and the country or origin thereof. In the case of mixtures 
of whisky, not conforming to any type designation in Sec. 5.22(b), 
Class 2, the components of which were distilled in more than one 
country, there shall be stated in direct conjunction with the class 
designation ``whisky'' a truthful and adequate statement of the 
composition of the product.
    (d) Whisky manufactured in Scotland, Ireland, or Canada. All whisky 
manufactured in Scotland, Ireland, or Canada, shall be deemed to be 
Scotch, Irish, or Canadian whisky, and shall be so designated, in 
conformity with Sec. 5.22(b) (7), (8), and (9), unless the application 
of such designation to the particular product will result in consumer 
deception, or unless such a product is not entitled to such designation 
under the laws of the country in which manufactured.
    (e) Cordials and liqueurs. The alcoholic components of cordails and 
liqueurs may, but need not, be stated on labels.


<R05>

    (a) ``Bottled by''. (1) On labels of domestic distilled spirits 
there shall be stated the phrase ``bottled by'', ``packed by'', or 
``filled by'', immediately followed by the name (or trade name) of the 
bottler and the place where such distilled spirits are bottled. If the 
bottler is the actual bona fide operator of more than one distilled 
spirits plant engaged in bottling operations, there may, in addition, be 
stated immediately following the name (or trade name) of such bottler 
the addresses of such other plants.
    (2) Where distilled spirits are bottled by or for the distiller 
thereof, there may be stated, in lieu of the phrase ``bottled by'', 
``packed by'', or ``filled by'', followed by the bottler's name (or 
trade name) and address, the phrase ``distilled by'', followed by the 
name, or the trade name under which the particular spirits were 
distilled, or (except in the case of distilled spirits labeled as 
bottled in bond) any trade name shown on the distiller's permit 
(covering the premises where the particular spirits were distilled), and 
the address (or addresses) of the distiller.
    (3) Where ``straight whiskies'' of the same type which have been 
produced in the same State by two or more different distillers are 
combined (either at time of bottling or at a warehouseman's bonded 
premises for further storage) and subsequently bottled and labeled as 
``straight whisky,'' such ``straight whisky'' shall be labeled in 
accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. 
Where such ``straight whisky'' is bottled by or for the distillers 
thereof, there may be stated on the label, in lieu of the requirements 
of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the phraise ``distilled by,'' 
followed by the names (or trade names) of the different distillers who 
distilled a portion of the ``straight whisky,'' the addresses of the 
distilleries where the ``straight whisky'' was distilled, and the 
percentage of ``straight whisky'' distilled by each distiller (with a 
tolerance of plus or minus 2 percent). In the case where ``straight 
whisky'' is made up of a mixture of ``straight whiskies'' of the same 
type from two or more different distilleries of the same proprietor 
located within the same State, and where the ``straight whisky'' is 
bottled by or for the proprietor thereof, such ``straight whisky'' may 
be labeled, in lieu of the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of the this 
section, with the phrase ``distilled by'' followed by the name (or trade 
name) of the proprietor and the addresses of the different distilleries 
which distilled a portion of the ``straight whisky.''
    (4) Where distilled spirits are bottled by or for the rectifier 
thereof, there may be stated, in lieu of the phrase ``bottled by'', 
``packed by'', or ``filled by'', followed by the bottler's name (or 
trade name) and address, the phrases ``blended by'', ``made by'', 
``prepared by'', ``manufactured by'', or ``produced by'' (whichever may 
be appropriate to the act of rectification involved) followed by the 
name (or trade name), and

[[Page 65]]

the address (or addresses) of the rectifier.
    (5) In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) 
of this paragraph, the labels of bottled in bond spirits shall bear the 
real name of the distillery or the trade name under which the distillery 
produced and warehoused the spirits, the number of the plant in which 
produced and the number of the plant in which bottled.
    (6) The label may state the address of the proprietor's principal 
place of business in lieu of the place where the bottling, distilling or 
rectification operation occurred, if the address where the operation 
occurred is indicated by printing, coding, or other markings, on the 
label or on the bottle.
    (b) ``Imported by''. (1) On labels of imported distilled spirits, 
bottled prior to importation, there shall be stated the words ``imported 
by'', ``imported exclusively by'', or a similar appropriate phrase, and 
immediately thereafter the name of the importer, or exclusive agent, or 
sole distributor, or other person responsible for the importation, 
together with the principal place of business in the United States of 
such person.
    (2) On labels of imported distilled spirits bottled after 
importation there shall be stated:
    (i) The name of the bottler and place where bottled, immediately 
preceded by the words ``bottled by'', ``packed by'', or ``filled by''; 
or
    (ii) The name of the bottler and place where bottled, immediately 
preceded by the words ``bottled by'', ``packed by'', or ``filled by'' 
and in conjunction therewith the name and address of the person 
responsible for the importation, in the manner prescribed in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section; or
    (iii) The name and principal place of business in the United States 
of the person responsible for the importation, if the spirits are 
bottled for such person, immediately preceded by the phrase ``imported 
by and bottled (packed), (filled) in the United States for'' (or a 
similar appropriate phrase); or,
    (iv) In the case of imported distilled spirits bottled after 
importation by the person responsible for the importation, the words 
``imported and bottled (packed), (filled) by'', ``imported and bottled 
(packed), (filled) exclusively by'', or a similar appropriate phrase, 
and immediately thereafter the name of such person and the address of 
the place where bottled or the address of such person's principal place 
of business.
    (c) Post office address. The ``place'' stated shall be the post 
office address, except that the street address may be omitted. No 
additional places or addresses shall be stated for the same person, firm 
or corporation, unless (1) such person or retailer is actively engaged 
in the conduct of an additional bona fide and actual alcoholic beverage 
business at such additional place or address, and (2) the label also 
contains in direct conjunction therewith, appropriate descriptive 
material indicating the function occurring at such additional place or 
address.
    (d) State of distillation. Except in the case of ``light whisky'', 
``blended light whisky'', ``blended whisky'', ``a blend of straight 
whiskies'', or ``spirit whisky'', the State of distillation shall be 
shown on the label of any whisky produced in the United States if the 
whisky is not distilled in the State given in the address on the brand 
label. The appropriate TTB officer may, however, require the State of 
distillation to be shown on the label or he may permit such other 
labeling as may be necessary to negate any misleading or deceptive 
impression which might be created as to the actual State of 
distillation. In the case of ``light whisky'', as defined in Sec. 
5.22(b)(3), the State of distillation shall not appear in any manner on 
any label, when the appropriate TTB officer finds such State is 
associated by consumers with an American type whisky, except as a part 
of a name and address as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (e) Country of origin. On labels of imported distilled spirits there 
shall be stated the country of origin in substantially the following 
form ``Product of ------------'', the blank to be filled in with the 
name of the country of origin.

label

[[Page 66]]

must be identical to the trade name listed on the permittee's basic 
permit.

Sec. 5.37  Alcohol content.

    (a) Statements--(1) Mandatory statement. The alcohol content for 
distilled spirits shall be stated in percent-alcohol-by-volume. Products 
such as ``Rock and Rye. or similar products containing a significant 
amount of solid material shall state the alcohol content at the time of 
bottling as follows: ``Bottled at ------ percent-alcohol-by-volume.''
    (2) Optional statement. In addition, the label may also state the 
alcohol content in degrees of proof if this information appears in 
direct conjunction (i.e. with no intervening material) with the 
statement expressed in percent-alcohol-by-volume. If both forms of 
alcohol content are shown, the optional statement in degrees of proof 
shall be placed in parentheses, in brackets, or otherwise distinguished 
from the mandatory statement in percent-alcohol-by-by-volume to 
emphasize the fact that both expressions of alcohol content mean the 
same thing.
    (b) Tolerances. The following tolerances shall be allowed (without 
affecting the labeled statement of alcohol content) for losses of 
alcohol content occurring during bottling:
    (1) Not to exceed 0.25 percent alcohol by volume for spirits

Sec. 5.40  Statements of age and percentage.

    (a) Statements of age and percentage for whisky. In the case of 
straight whisky bottled in conformity with the bottled in bond labeling 
requirements and of domestic or foreign whisky, whether or not mixed or 
blended, all of which is 4 years old or more, statements of age and 
percentage are optional. As to all other whiskies there shall be stated 
the following:
    (1) In the case of whisky, whether or not mixed or blended but 
containing no neutral spirits, the age of the youngest whisky. The age 
statement shall read substantially as follows: ``------ years old.''
    (2) In the case of whisky, containing neutral spirits, if any of the 
straight whisky and/or other whisky is less than 4 years old, the 
percentage by volume of straight whisky and/or other whisky, and the age 
of the straight whisky (the youngest if two or more) and the age of such 
other whisky (the youngest if two or more). If all the straight whisky 
and/or other whisky is 4 years or more old, the age and percentage 
statement for such whiskies is optional. The age and percentage 
statement for straight whiskies and/or other whisky, whether required or 
optional, shall be stated in immediate conjunction with the neutral 
spirits statement required by Sec. 5.39, and shall read substantially 
as follows:
    (i) If only one straight whisky and no other whisky is contained in 
the blend: ``---- percent straight whisky ---- years old.''
    (ii) If more than one straight whisky and no other whisky is 
contained in the blend: ``---- percent straight whiskies ---- years or 
more old.'' The age blank shall be filled in with the age of the 
youngest straight whisky. In lieu of the foregoing, a statement may be 
made of the ages and percentages of each of the straight whiskies 
contained in the blend: ``---- percent straight whisky ---- years old, 
---- percent

[[Page 68]]

straight whisky ---- years old, and ---- percent straight whisky ---- 
years old.''
    (iii) If only one straight whisky and one other whisky is contained 
in the blend: ``---- percent straight whisky ---- years old, ---- 
percent whisky ---- years old.''
    (iv) If more than one straight whisky and more than one other whisky 
is contained in the blend: ``---- percent straight whiskies ---- years 
or more old, ---- percent whiskies ---- years or more old.'' The age 
blanks shall be filled in with the ages of the youngest straight whisky 
and the youngest other whisky. In lieu of the foregoing, a statement may 
be made of the ages and percentages of each of the straight whiskies and 
other whiskies contained in the blend: ``---- percent straight whisky --
-- years old, ---- percent straight whisky ---- years old, ---- percent 
whisky ---- years old, and ---- percent whisky ---- years old.''
    (3) In the case of imported whiskies described in Sec. 5.22(l), 
Class 12, the labels shall state the ages and percentages in the same 
manner and form as is required for the same type of whisky produced in 
the United States.
    (4) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, in 
the case of whisky produced in the United States and stored in reused 
oak containers, except for corn whisky, and for light whisky produced on 
or after January 26, 1968, there shall be stated in lieu of the words 
``---- years old'' the period of storage in reused oak containers as 
follows: ``---- stored ---- years in reused cooperage.''
    (5) Optional age statements shall appear in the same form as 
required age statements.
    (b) Statements of age for rum, brandy, and Tequila. Age may, but 
need not, be stated on labels of rums, brandies, and Tequila, except 
that an appropriate statement with respect to age shall appear on the 
brand label in case of brandy (other than immature brandies and fruit 
brandies which are not customarily stored in oak containers) not stored 
in oak containers for a period of at least 2 years. If age is stated, it 
shall be substantially as follows: ``---- years old''; the blank to be 
filled in with the age of the youngest distilled spirits in the product.
    (c) Statement of storage for grain spirits. In case of grain 
spirits, the period of storage in oak containers may be stated in 
immediate conjunction with the required percentage statement; for 
example, ``----% grain spirits stored ---- years in oak containers.''
    (d) Other distilled spirits. Age, maturity, or similar statements or 
representations as to neutral spirits (except for grain spirits as 
stated in paragraph (c) of this section), gin, liqueurs, cordials, 
cocktails, highballs, bitters, flavored brandy, flavored gin, flavored 
rum, flavored vodka, flavored whisky, and specialties are misleading and 
are prohibited from being stated on any label.
    (e) Miscellaneous age representations. (1) Age may be understated 
but shall not be overstated.
    (2) If any age, maturity, or similar representation is made relative 
to any distilled spirits (such representations for products enumerated 
in paragraph (d) of this section are prohibited), the age shall also be 
stated on all labels where such representation appears, and in a manner 
substantially as conspicuous as such representation: Provided. That the 
use of the word ``old'' or other word denoting age, as part of the brand 
name, shall not be deemed to be an age representation: And provided 
further, That the labels of whiskies and brandies (except immature 
brandies) not required to bear a statement of age, and rum and Tequila 
aged for not less than 4 years, may contain general inconspicuous age, 
maturity or similar representations without the label bearing an age 
statement.

Sec. 5.42  Prohibited practices.

    (a) Statements on labels. Bottles containing distilled spirits, or 
any labels on such bottles, or any individual covering, carton, or other 
container of such bottles used for sale at retail, or any written, 
printed, graphic, or other matter accompanying such bottles to the 
consumer shall not contain:
    (1) Any statement that is false or untrue in any particular, or 
that, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, omission, or 
inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific or technical 
matter, tends to create a misleading impression.
    (2) Any statement that is disparaging of a competitor's product.
    (3) Any statement, design, device, or representation which is 
obscene or indecent.
    (4) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating 
to analyses, standards, or tests, irrespective of falsity, which the 
appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer.
    (5) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating 
to any guarantee, irrespective of falsity, which the appropriate TTB 
officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer. Money-back 
guarantees are not prohibited.
    (6) A trade or brand name that is the name of any living individual 
of public prominence, or existing private or public organization, or is 
a name that is in simulation or is an abbreviation thereof, or any 
graphic, pictorial, or emblematic representation of any such individual 
or organization, if the use of such name or representation is likely to 
falsely lead the consumer to believe that the product has been endorsed, 
made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision of, or in 
accordance with the specifications of, such individual or organization: 
Provided, That this paragraph shall not apply to the use of the name of 
any person engaged in business as a distiller, rectifier, blender, or 
other producer, or as an importer, wholesaler, retailer, bottler, or 
warehouseman, of distilled spirits, nor to the use by any person of a 
trade or brand name that is the name of any living individual of public 
prominence or existing private or public organization, provided such 
trade or brand name was used by him or his predecessors in interest 
prior to August 29, 1935.
    (b) Miscellaneous. (1) Labels shall not be of such design as to 
resemble or simulate a stamp of the U.S. Government or any State or 
foreign government. Labels, other than stamps authorized or required by 
this or any other government, shall not state or indicate that the 
distilled spirits are distilled, blended, made, bottled, or sold under, 
or in accordance with, any municipal, State, Federal, or foreign 
authorization, law, or regulations, unless such statement is required or 
specifically authorized by Federal, State, municipal, or foreign law or 
regulations. The statements authorized by this part to appear on labels 
for domestic distilled spirits are ``Distilled (produced, barreled, 
warehoused, blended, or bottled, or any combination thereof, as the case 
may be) under United States (U.S.)

[[Page 70]]

Government supervision'', or in the case of distilled spirits labeled as 
bottled in bond, ``Bottled in bond under United States (U.S.) Government 
supervision''. If the municipal, State, or Federal Government permit 
number is stated on a label, it shall not be accompanied by any 
additional statement relating thereto.
    (2) If imported distilled spirits are covered by a certificate of 
origin or of age issued by a duly authorized official of the appropriate 
foreign government, the label, except where prohibited by the foreign 
government, may refer to such certificate or the fact of such 
certification, but shall not be accompanied by any additional statement 
relating thereto. The reference to such certificate or certification 
shall, in the case of Cognac, be substantially in the following form: 
``This product accompanied at the time of importation by an `Acquit 
Regional Jaune d'Or' issued by the French Government, indicating that 
this grape brandy was distilled in the Cognac Region of France''; and in 
the case of other distilled spirits, substantially in the following 
form: ``This product accompanied at time of importation by a certificate 
issued by the ---- government (name of government) indicating that the 
product is ---- (class and type as required to be stated on the label), 
and (if label claims age) that none of the distilled spirits are of an 
age less than stated on this label.''
    (3) The words ``bond'', ``bonded'', ``bottled in bond'', ``aged in 
bond'', or phrases containing these or synonymous terms, shall not be 
used on any label or as part of the brand name of domestic distilled 
spirits unless the distilled spirits are:
    (i) Composed of the same kind of spirits produced from the same 
class of materials;
    (ii) Produced in the same distilling season by the same distiller at 
the same distillery;
    (iii) Stored for at least four years in wooden containers wherein 
the spirits have been in contact with the wood surface except for gin 
and vodka which must be stored for at least four years in wooden 
containers coated or lined with paraffin or other substance which will 
preclude contact of the spirits with the wood surface;
    (iv) Unaltered from their original condition or character by the 
addition or subtraction of any substance other than by filtration, chill 
proofing, or other physical treatments (which do not involve the 
addition of any substance which will remain incorporated in the finished 
product or result in a change in class or type);
    (v) Reduced in proof by the addition of pure water only to 100 
degrees of proof; and
    (vi) Bottles at 100 degrees of proof.

In addition to the requirements of Sec. 5.36(a) (1) or (2), the label 
shall bear the real name of the distillery or the trade name under which 
the distillery produced and warehoused the spirits, and the plant (or 
registered distillery) number in which produced; and the plant number in 
which bottled. The label may also bear the name or trade name of the 
bottler.
    (4) The words ``bond'', ``bonded'', ``bottled in bond'', ``aged in 
bond'', or phrases containing these or synonymous terms, shall not be 
used on any label or as part of the brand name of imported distilled 
spirits unless the distilled spirits meet in all respects the 
requirements applicable to distilled spirits bottled for domestic 
consumption, so labeled, and unless the laws and regulations of the 
country in which such distilled spirits are produced authorize the 
bottling of distilled spirits in bond and require or specifically 
authorize such distilled spirits to be so labeled. All spirits labeled 
as ``bonded'', ``bottled in bond'', or ``aged in bond'' pursuant to the 
provisions of this paragraph shall bear in direct conjunction with such 
statement and in script, type, or printing substantially as conspicuous 
as that used on such statement, the name of the country under whose laws 
and regulations such distilled spirits were so bottled.
    (5) The word ``pure'' shall not be stated upon labels unless:
    (i) It refers to a particular ingredient used in the production of 
the distilled spirits, and is a truthful representation about that 
ingredient; or
    (ii) It is part of the bona fide name of a permittee or retailer for 
whom the distilled spirits are bottled; or

[[Page 71]]

    (iii) It is part of the bona fide name of the permittee who bottled 
the distilled spirits.
    (6) Distilled spirits shall not be labeled as ``double distilled'' 
or ''triple distilled'' or any similar term unless it is a truthful 
statement of fact; except that ``double distilled'' or ``triple 
distilled'' shall not be permitted on labels of distilled spirits 
produced by the redistillation method when a second or third 
distillation step is a necessary distillation process for the production 
of the product.
    (7) Labels shall not contain any statement, design, device, or 
pictorial representation which the appropriate TTB officer finds relates 
to, or is capable of being construed as relating to, the armed forces of 
the United States, or the American flag, or any emblem, seal, insignia, 
or decoration associated with such flag or armed forces; nor shall any 
label contain any statement, design, device, or pictorial representation 
of or concerning any flag, seal, coat of arms, crest or other insignia, 
likely to mislead the consumer to believe that the product has been 
endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision 
of, or in accordance with the specifications of the government, 
organization, family, or individual with whom such flag, seal, coat of 
arms, crest, or insignia is associated.
    (8) Health-related statements--(i) Definitions. When used in this 
paragraph (b)(8), terms are defined as follows:
    (A) Health-related statement means any statement related to health 
(other than the warning statement required by Sec. 16.21 of this 
chapter) and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature 
that, expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the 
consumption of alcohol, distilled spirits, or any substance found within 
the distilled spirits, and health benefits or effects on health. The 
term includes both specific health claims and general references to 
alleged health benefits or effects on health associated with the 
consumption of alcohol, distilled spirits, or any substance found within 
the distilled spirits, as well as health-related directional statements. 
The term also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical 
or psychological sensation results from consuming the distilled spirits, 
as well as statements and claims of nutritional value (e.g., statements 
of vitamin content). Statements concerning caloric, carbohydrate, 
protein, and fat content do not constitute nutritional claims about the 
product.
    (B) Specific health claim is a type of health-related statement 
that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the 
distilled spirits, alcohol, or any substance found within the distilled 
spirits, to a disease or health-related condition. Implied specific 
health claims include statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of 
communication that suggest, within the context in which they are 
presented, that a relationship exists between distilled spirits, 
alcohol, or any substance found within the distilled spirits, and a 
disease or health-related condition.
    (C) Health-related directional statement is a type of health-related 
statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or other 
source for information regarding the effects on health of distilled 
spirits or alcohol consumption.
    (ii) Rules for labeling--(A) Health-related statements. In general, 
labels may not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in 
any particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the 
effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will evaluate such 
statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part of the 
health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying statement 
to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related 
statement.
    (B) Specific health claims. (1) TTB will consult with the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), as needed, on the use of a specific health 
claim on a distilled spirits label. If FDA determines that the use of 
such a labeling claim is a drug claim that is not in compliance with the 
requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, TTB will not 
approve the use of that specific health claim on a distilled spirits 
label.
    (2) TTB will approve the use of a specific health claim on a 
distilled spirits label only if the claim is truthful and adequately 
substantiated by scientific

[[Page 72]]

or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed and qualified with respect to 
the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; adequately 
discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and heavier 
levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of 
individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health 
risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health 
claim.
    (C) Health-related directional statements. A statement that directs 
consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the 
effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol consumption is 
presumed misleading unless it--
    (1) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to 
a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the 
effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol consumption; and
    (2)(i) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement 
the following disclaimer: ``This statement should not encourage you to 
drink or to increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons;'' or
    (ii) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement 
some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds 
is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the 
health-related directional statement.

carton or other container of a bottle shall not be so designed as to 
mislead purchasers as to the size of the bottles.
    (b) Headspace. A liquor bottle of a capacity of 200 milliliters or 
more shall be held to be so filled as to mislead the purchaser if it has 
a headspace in excess of 8 percent of the total capacity of the bottle 
after closure.
    (c) Design. A liquor bottle shall be held (irrespective of the 
correctness of the stated net contents) to be so made and formed as to 
mislead the purchaser, if its actual capacity is substantially less than 
the capacity it appears to have upon visual examination under ordinary 
conditions of purchase or use.
    (d) Exceptions--(1) Distinctive liquor bottles. The headspace and 
design requirements in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section do not 
apply to liquor bottles that are specifically exempted by the

    (b) Tolerances. The following tolerances shall be allowed:
    (1) Discrepancies due to errors in measuring which occur in filling 
conducted in compliance with good commercial practice.
    (2) Discrepancies due to differences in the capacity of bottles, 
resulting solely from unavoidable difficulties in manufacturing such 
bottles to a uniform capacity: Provided, That no greater tolerance shall 
be allowed in case of bottles which, because of their design, cannot be 
made of approximately uniform capacity than is allowed in case of 
bottles which can be manufactured so as to be of approximately uniform 
capacity.
    (3) Discrepancies in measure due to differences in atmospheric 
conditions in various places and which unavoidably result from the 
ordinary and customary exposure of alcoholic beverages in bottles to 
evaporation. The reasonableness of discrepancies under this paragraph 
shall be determined on the facts in each case.
    (c) Unreasonable shortages. Unreasonable shortages in certain of the 
bottles in any shipment shall not be compensated by overages in other 
bottles in the same shipment.
    (d) Limitations. This section does not apply after December 31,

    (a) Responsible advertiser. The advertisement shall state the name 
and address of the permittee responsible for its publication or 
broadcast. Street number and name may be omitted in the address.
    (b) Class and type. The advertisement shall contain a conspicuous 
statement of the class to which the product belongs and the type thereof 
corresponding with the statement of class and type which is required to 
appear on the label of the product.

    (2) Optional statement. In addition, the advertisement may also 
state the alcohol content in degrees of proof if this information 
appears in direct conjunction (i.e. with no intervening material) with 
the statement expressed in percent-alcohol-by-volume. If both forms of 
alcohol content are shown, the optional statement in degrees of proof 
shall be placed in parentheses, in brackets, or otherwise distinguished 
from the mandatory statement in percent-alcohol-by-volume to emphasize 
the fact that both expressions of alcohol content mean the same thing.
    (d) Percentage of neutral spirits and name of commodity. (1) In the 
case of distilled spirits (other than cordials, liqueurs, and 
specialties) produced by blending or rectification, if neutral spirits 
have been used in the production thereof, there shall be stated the 
percentage of neutral spirits so used and the name of the commodity from 
which such neutral spirits have been distilled. The statement of 
percentage and the name of the commodity shall be made in substantially 
the following form: ``----% neutral spirits distilled from -------- 
(insert grain, cane products, or fruit, as appropriate)''; or ----% 
neutral spirits (vodka) distilled from -------- (insert grain, cane 
product, or fruit, as appropriate)''; or ``----% grain (cane products), 
(fruit) neutral spirits''; or ``----% grain spirits''.
    (2) In the case of neutral spirits or of gin produced by a process 
of continuous distillation, there shall be stated the name of the 
commodity from which such neutral spirits or gin has been distilled. The 
statement of the name of the commodity shall be made in substantially 
the following form: ``Distilled from grain'', or ``Distilled from cane 
products'', or ``Distilled from fruit.''

[[Page 78]]

    (e) Exception. (1) If an advertisement refers to a general distilled 
spirits line or all of the distilled spirits products of one company, 
whether by the company name or by the brand name common to all the 
distilled spirits in the line, the only mandatory information necessary 
is the name and address of the responsible advertiser. This exception 
does not apply where only one type of distilled spirits is marketed 
under the specific brand name advertised.
    (2) On consumer specialty items, the only information necessary is 
the company name or brand name of the product.

Sec. 5.65  Prohibited practices.

    (a) Restrictions. An advertisement of distilled spirits shall not 
contain:
    (1) Any statement that is false or untrue in any material 
particular, or that, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, 
omission, or inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific or 
technical matter tends to create a misleading impression.
    (2) Any statement that is disparaging of a competitor's product.
    (3) Any statement, design, device, or representation which is 
obscene or indecent.
    (4) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating 
to analyses, standards or tests, irrespective of falsity, which the 
appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer.
    (5) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating 
to any guarantee, irrespective of falsity, which the appropriate TTB 
officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer. Money-back 
guarantees are not prohibited.
    (6) Any statement that the distilled spirits are distilled, blended, 
made, bottled, or sold under or in accordance with any municipal, State, 
Federal, or foreign authorization, law, or regulation, unless such 
statement appears in the manner authorized by Sec. 5.42 for labels of 
distilled spirits. If a municipal, State or Federal permit number is 
stated, such permit number shall not be accompanied by any additional 
statement relating thereto.
    (7) The words ``bond'', ``bonded'', ``bottled in bond'', ``aged in 
bond'', or phrases containing these or synonymous terms, unless such 
words or phrases appear, pursuant to Sec. 5.42, on labels of the 
distilled spirits advertised, and are stated in the advertisement in the 
manner and form in which they are permitted to appear on the label.
    (8) The word ``pure'' unless:
    (i) It refers to a particular ingredient used in the production of 
the distilled spirits, and is a truthful representation about the 
ingredient; or
    (ii) It is part of the bona fide name of a permittee or retailer 
from whom the distilled spirits are bottled; or
    (iii) It is part of the bona fide name of the permittee who bottled 
the distilled spirits.
    (9) The words ``double distilled'' or ``triple distilled'' or any 
similar terms unless it is a truthful statement of fact; except that 
``double distilled'' or

[[Page 79]]

``triple distilled'' shall not be permitted in advertisements of 
distilled spirits produced by the redistillation method when a second or 
third distillation step is a necessary distillation process for the 
production of the product.
    (b) Statements inconsistent with labeling. (1) Advertisements shall 
not contain any statement concerning a brand or lot of distilled spirits 
that is inconsistent with any statement on the labeling thereof.
    (2) Any label depicted on a bottle in an advertisement shall be a 
reproduction of an approved label.
    (c) Statement of age. The advertisement shall not contain any 
statement, design, or device directly or by implication concerning age 
or maturity of any brand or lot of distilled spirits unless a statement 
of age appears on the label of the advertised product. When any such 
statement, design, or device concerning age or maturity is contained in 
any advertisement, it shall include (in direct conjunction therewith and 
with substantially equal conspicuousness) all parts of the statement, if 
any, concerning age and percentages required to be made on the label 
under the provisions of Sec. Sec. 5.31 through 5.42. An advertisement 
for any whisky or brandy (except immature brandies) which is not 
required to bear a statement of age on the label or an advertisement for 
any rum or Tequila, which has been aged for not less than 4 years may, 
however, contain inconspicuous, general representation as to age, 
maturity or other similar representations even though a specific age 
statement does not appear on the label of the advertised product and in 
the advertisement itself.
    (d) Health-related statements--(1) Definitions. When used in this 
paragraph (d), terms are defined as follows:
    (i) Health-related statement means any statement related to health 
and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature that, 
expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the 
consumption of alcohol, distilled spirits, or any substance found within 
the distilled spirits, and health benefits or effects on health. The 
term includes both specific health claims and general references to 
alleged health benefits or effects on health associated with the 
consumption of alcohol, distilled spirits, or any substance found within 
the distilled spirits, as well as health-related directional statements. 
The term also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical 
or psychological sensation results from consuming the distilled spirits, 
as well as statements and claims of nutritional value (e.g., statements 
of vitamin content). Statements concerning caloric, carbohydrate, 
protein, and fat content do not constitute nutritional claims about the 
product.
    (ii) Specific health claim is a type of health-related statement 
that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the 
distilled spirits, alcohol, or any substance found within the distilled 
spirits, to a disease or health-related condition. Implied specific 
health claims include statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of 
communication that suggest, within the context in which they are 
presented, that a relationship exists between distilled spirits, 
alcohol, or any substance found within the distilled spirits, and a 
disease or health-related condition.
    (iii) Health-related directional statement is a type of health-
related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or 
other source for information regarding the effects on health of 
distilled spirits or alcohol consumption.
    (2) Rules for advertising--(i) Health-related statements. In 
general, advertisements may not contain any health-related statement 
that is untrue in any particular or tends to create a misleading 
impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will 
evaluate such statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part 
of the health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying 
statement to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-
related statement. Such disclaimer or other qualifying statement must 
appear as prominent as the health-related statement.
    (ii) Specific health claims. A specific health claim will not be 
considered misleading if it is truthful and adequately substantiated by 
scientific or

[[Page 80]]

medical evidence; sufficiently detailed and qualified with respect to 
the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; adequately 
discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and heavier 
levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of 
individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health 
risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim 
and in a manner as prominent as the specific health claim.
    (iii) Health-related directional statements. A statement that 
directs consumers to a third party or other source for information 
regarding the effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol 
consumption is presumed misleading unless it--
    (A) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to 
a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the 
effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol consumption; and
    (B)(1) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, 
and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional 
statement, the following disclaimer: ``This statement should not 
encourage you to drink or increase your alcohol consumption for health 
reasons;'' or
    (2) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, 
and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional 
statement, some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB 
officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed 
by the health-related directional statement.
    (e) Place of origin. The advertisement shall not represent that the 
distilled spirits were manufactured in or imported from a place or 
country other than that of their actual origin, or were produced or 
processed by one who was not in fact the actual producer or processor.
    (f) Confusion of brands. Two or more different brands or lots of 
distilled spirits shall not be advertised in one advertisement (or in 
two or more advertisements in one issue of a periodical or newspaper, or 
in one piece of other written, printed, or graphic matter) if the 
advertisement tends to create the impression that representations made 
as to one brand or lot apply to the other or others, and if as to such 
latter the representations contravene any provisions of this subpart or 
are in any respect untrue.
    (g) Flags, seals, coats of arms, crests, and other insignia. An 
advertisement shall not contain any statement, design, device, or 
pictorial representation which the appropriate TTB officer finds relates 
to, or is capable of being construed as relating to the armed forces of 
the United States, or the American flag, or any emblem, seal, insignia, 
or decoration associated with such flag or armed forces; nor shall any 
advertisement contain any statement, design, device, or pictorial 
representation of or concerning any flag, seal, coat of arms, crest, or 
other insignia, likely to mislead the consumer to believe that the 
product has been endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or under 
the supervision of, or in accordance with the specifications of the 
government, organization, family, or individual with whom such flag, 
seal, coat of arms, crest, or insignia is associated.
    (h) Deceptive advertising techniques. Subliminal or similar 
techniques are prohibited. ``Subliminal or similar techniques,'' as used 
in this part, refers to any device or technique that is used to convey, 
or attempts to convey, a message to a person by means of images or 
sounds of a very brief nature that cannot be perceived at a normal level 
of awareness.

    (a) General. Comparative advertising shall not be disparaging of a

advertisements comparing competitors' products unless they are 
disparaging, deceptive, or likely to mislead the consumer.
    (2) The taste test procedure used shall meet scientifically accepted 
procedures. An example of a scientifically accepted procedure is 
outlined in the Manual on Sensory Testing Methods, ASTM Special 
Technical Publication 434, published by the American Society

    (a) Exclusion, in whole or in part occurs:

over the retailer; and
    (2) Such practice results in the retailer purchasing less than it 
would have of a competitor's product.

particular practice, other than those in Sec. 6.152, places retailer 
independence at risk. A practice need not meet all of the criteria 
specified in this section in order to place retailer independence at 
risk.
    (a) The practice restricts or hampers the free economic choice of a 
retailer to decide which products to purchase or the quantity in which 
to purchase them for sale to consumers.
    (b) The industry member obligates the retailer to participate in the 
promotion to obtain the industry member's product.

otherwise promote the industry member's product.
    (d) The retailer has a commitment not to terminate its relationship 
with the industry member with respect to purchase of the industry 
member's products.
    (e) The practice involves the industry member in the day-to-day 
operations of the retailer. For example, the industry member controls 
the retailer's decisions on which brand of products to purchase, the 
pricing of products, or the manner in which the products will be 
displayed on the retailer's premises.
    (f) The practice is discriminatory in that it is not offered to all 
retailers in the local market on the same terms without business reasons 
present to justify the difference in treatment.

Sec. 7.22a  Voluntary disclosure of major food allergens.

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section the following terms 
have the meanings indicated.
    (1) Major food allergen. Major food allergen means any of the 
following:
    (i) Milk, egg, fish (for example, bass, flounder, or cod), 
Crustacean shellfish (for example, crab, lobster, or shrimp), tree nuts 
(for example, almonds, pecans, or walnuts), wheat, peanuts, and 
soybeans; or
    (ii) A food ingredient that contains protein derived from a food 
specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, except:
    (A) Any highly refined oil derived from a food specified in 
paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section and any ingredient derived from such 
highly refined oil; or

[[Page 96]]

    (B) A food ingredient that is exempt from major food allergen 
labeling requirements pursuant to a petition for exemption approved by 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under 21 U.S.C. 343(w)(6) or 
pursuant to a notice submitted to FDA under 21 U.S.C. 343(w)(7), 
provided that the food ingredient meets the terms or conditions, if any, 
specified for that exemption.
    (2) Name of the food source from which each major food allergen is 
derived. Name of the food source from which each major food allergen is 
derived means the name of the food as listed in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of 
this section, except that:
    (i) In the case of a tree nut, it means the name of the specific 
type of nut (for example, almonds, pecans, or walnuts); and
    (ii) In the case of Crustacean shellfish, it means the name of the 
species of Crustacean shellfish (for example, crab, lobster, or shrimp); 
and
    (iii) The names ``egg'' and ``peanuts'', as well as the names of the 
different types of tree nuts, may be expressed in either the singular or 
plural form, and the name ``soy'', ``soybean'', or ``soya'' may be used 
instead of ``soybeans''.
    (b) Voluntary labeling standards. Major food allergens (defined in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section) used in the production of a malt 
beverage product may, on a voluntary basis, be declared on any label 
affixed to the container. However, if any one major food allergen is 
voluntarily declared, all major food allergens used in production of the 
malt beverage product, including major food allergens used as fining or 
processing agents, must be declared, except when covered by a petition 
for exemption approved by the appropriate TTB officer under Sec. 7.22b. 
The major food allergens declaration must consist of the word 
``Contains'' followed by a colon and the name of the food source from 
which each major food allergen is derived (for example, ``Contains: 
egg'').
    (c) Cross reference. For mandatory labeling requirements applicable 
to malt beverage products containing FD&C Yellow No. 5, sulfites, and 
aspartame, see Sec. Sec. 7.22(b)(4), (b)(6), and (b)(7).

<R05>
Sec. 7.22b  Petitions for exemption from major food allergen labeling.

    (a) Submission of petition. Any person may petition the appropriate 
TTB officer to exempt a particular product or class of products from the 
labeling requirements of Sec. 7.22a. The burden is on the petitioner to 
provide scientific evidence (including the analytical method used to 
produce the evidence) that demonstrates that the finished product or 
class of products, as derived by the method specified in the petition, 
either:
    (1) Does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human 
health; or
    (2) Does not contain allergenic protein derived from one of the 
foods identified in Sec. 7.22(a)(1)(i), even though a major food 
allergen was used in production.
    (b) Decision on petition. TTB will approve or deny a petition for 
exemption submitted under paragraph (a) of this section in writing 
within 180 days of receipt of the petition. If TTB does not provide a 
written response to the petitioner within that 180-day period, the 
petition will be deemed denied, unless an extension of time for decision 
is mutually agreed upon by the appropriate TTB officer and the 
petitioner. TTB may confer with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
on petitions for exemption, as appropriate and as FDA resources permit. 
TTB may require the submission of product samples and other additional 
information in support of a petition; however, unless required by TTB, 
the submission of samples or additional information by the petitioner 
after submission of the petition will be treated as the withdrawal of 
the initial petition and the submission of a new petition. An approval 
or denial under this section will constitute a final agency action.
    (c) Resubmission of a petition. After a petition for exemption is 
denied under this section, the petitioner may resubmit the petition 
along with supporting materials for reconsideration at any time. TTB 
will treat this submission as a new petition.
    (d) Availability of information--(1) General. TTB will promptly post 
to its public Web site, http://www.ttb.gov, all petitions received under 
this section as

[[Page 97]]

well as TTB's responses to those petitions. Any information submitted in 
support of the petition that is not posted to the TTB Web site will be 
available to the public pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552, except where a request 
for confidential treatment is granted under paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section.
    (2) Requests for confidential treatment of business information. A 
person who provides trade secrets or other commercial or financial 
information in connection with a petition for exemption under this 
section may request that TTB give confidential treatment to that 
information. A failure to request confidential treatment at the time the 
information in question is submitted to TTB will constitute a waiver of 
confidential treatment. A request for confidential treatment of 
information under this section must conform to the following standards:
    (i) The request must be in writing;
    (ii) The request must clearly identify the information to be kept 
confidential;
    (iii) The request must relate to information that constitutes trade 
secrets or other confidential commercial or financial information 
regarding the business transactions of an interested person, the 
disclosure of which would cause substantial harm to the competitive 
position of that person;
    (iv) The request must set forth the reasons why the information 
should not be disclosed, including the reasons the disclosure of the 
information would prejudice the competitive position of the interested 
person; and
    (v) The request must be supported by a signed statement by the 
interested person, or by an authorized officer or employee of that 
person, certifying that the information in question is a trade secret or 
other confidential commercial or financial information and that the 
information is not already in the public domain.

<R05>
Sec. 7.23  Brand names.

    (a) General. The product shall bear a brand name, except that if not 
sold under a brand name, then the name of the person required to appear 
on the brand label shall be deemed a brand name for the purpose of this 
part.
    (b) Misleading brand names. No label shall contain any brand name, 
which, standing alone, or in association with other printed or graphic 
matter, creates any impression or inference as to the age, origin, 
identity, or other characteristics of the product unless the appropriate 
TTB officer finds that such brand name, either when qualified by the 
word ``brand'' or when not so qualified, conveys no erroneous 
impressions as to the age, origin, identity, or other characteristics of 
the product.
    (c) Trade name of foreign origin. This section shall not operate to 
prohibit the use by any person of any trade name or brand of foreign 
origin not effectively registered in the United States Patent Office on 
August 29, 1935, which has been used by such person or his predecessors 
in the United States for a period of at least 5 years immediately 
preceding August 29, 1935: Provided, That if such trade name or brand is 
used, the designation of the product shall be qualified by the name of 
the locality in the United States in which produced, and such 
qualification shall be in script, type, or printing as conspicuous as 
the trade name or brand.


<R05>
Sec. 7.24  Class and type.

    (a) The class of the malt beverage shall be stated and, if desired, 
the type thereof may be stated. Statements of class and type shall 
conform to the designation of the product as known to the trade. If the 
product is not known to the trade under a particular designation, a 
distinctive or fanciful name, together with an adequate and truthful 
statement of the composition of the product, shall be stated, and such 
statement shall be deemed to be a statement of class and type for the 
purposes of this part.
    (b) Malt beverages which have been concentrated by the removal of 
water therefrom and reconstituted by the addition of water and carbon 
dioxide shall for the purpose of this part be labeled in the same manner 
as malt beverages which have not been concentrated and reconstituted, 
except that there shall appear in direct conjunction with, and as a part 
of, the class designation the statement ``PRODUCED FROM -------- 
CONCENTRATE'' (the blank to be filled in

[[Page 98]]

with the appropriate class designation). All parts of the class 
designation shall appear in lettering of substantially the same size and 
kind.
    (c) No product shall be designated as ``half and half'' unless it is 
in fact composed of equal parts of two classes of malt beverages the 
names of which are conspicuously stated in conjunction with the 
designation ``half and half''.
    (d) Products containing less than one-half of 1 percent (.5%) of 
alcohol by volume shall bear the class designation ``malt beverage,'' or 
``cereal beverage,'' or ``near beer.'' If the designation ``near beer'' 
is used, both words must appear in the same size and style of type, in 
the same color of ink, and on the same background. No product containing 
less than one-half of 1 percent of alcohol by volume shall bear the 
class designations ``beer'', ``lager beer'', ``lager'', ``ale'', 
``porter'', or ``stout'', or any other class or type designation 
commonly applied to malt beverages containing one-half of 1 percent or 
more of alcohol by volume.
    (e) No product other than a malt beverage fermented at comparatively 
high temperature, possessing the characteristics generally attributed to 
``ale,'' ``porter,'' or ``stout'' and produced without the use of 
coloring or flavoring materials (other than those recognized in standard 
brewing practices) shall bear any of these class designations.
    (f) Geographical names for distinctive types of malt beverages 
(other than names found under paragraph (g) of this section to have 
become generic) shall not be applied to malt beverages produced in any 
place other than the particular region indicated by the name unless (1) 
in direct conjunction with the name there appears the word ``type'' or 
the word ``American'', or some other statement indicating the true place 
of production in lettering substantially as conspicuous as such name, 
and (2) the malt beverages to which the name is applied conform to the 
type so designated. The following are examples of distinctive types of 
beer with geographical names that have not become generic; Dortmund, 
Dortmunder, Vienna, Wien, Wiener, Bavarian, Munich, Munchner, Salvator, 
Kulmbacher, Wurtzburger, Pilsen (Pilsener and Pilsner): Provided, That 
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, beer which is 
produced in the United States may be designated as ``Pilsen,'' 
``Pilsener,'' or ``Pilsner'' without further modification, if it 
conforms to such type.
    (g) Only such geographical names for distinctive types of malt 
beverages as the appropriate TTB officer finds have by usage and common 
knowledge lost their geographical significance to such an extent that 
they have become generic shall be deemed to have become generic, e.g., 
India Pale Ale.
    (h) Except as provided in Sec. 7.23(b), geographical names that are 
not names for distinctive types of malt beverages shall not be applied 
to malt beverages produced in any place other than the particular place 
or region indicated in the name.

Sec. 7.25  Name and address.

    (a) Domestic malt beverages. (1) On labels of containers of domestic 
malt beverages there shall be stated the name of the bottler or packer 
and the place where bottled or packed. The bottler's or packer's 
principal place of business may be shown in lieu of the actual place 
where bottled or packed if the address shown is a location where 
bottling or packing operation takes place. The appropriate TTB officer 
may disapprove the listing of a principal place of business if its use 
would create a false or misleading impression as to the geographic 
origin of the beer.
    (2) If malt beverages are bottled or packed for a person other than 
the actual bottler or packer there may be stated in addition to the name 
and address of the bottler or packer (but not in lieu of), the name and 
address of such other person immediately preceded by the words ``bottled 
for,'' ``distributed by,'' or other similar appropriate phrase.
    (b) Imported malt beverages. On labels of containers of imported 
malt beverages, there shall be stated the words

[[Page 99]]

``imported by,'' or a singular appropriate phrase, and immediately 
thereafter the name of the permittee who is the importer, or exclusive 
agent, or sole distributor, or other person responsible for the 
importation, together with the principal place of business in the United 
States of such person. In addition there may, but need not, be stated 
unless required by State or foreign law or regulation the name and 
principal place of business of the foreign manufacturer, bottler, 
packer, or shipper.
    (c) Post-office address. The ``place'' stated shall be the post-
office address, except that the street address may be omitted. No 
additional places or addresses shall be stated for the same person, 
unless (1) such person is actively engaged in the conduct of an 
additional bona fide and actual malt beverage business at such 
additional place or address, and (2) the label also contains, in direct 
conjunction therewith, appropriate descriptive material indicating the 
function occurring at such additional place or address in connection 
with the particular malt beverage.

Sec. 7.26  Alcoholic content [suspended as of April 19, 1993; see 
Sec. 7.71].

    (a) The alcoholic content and the percentage and quantity of the 
original extract shall not be stated unless required by State law. When 
alcoholic content is required to be stated, but the manner of statement 
is not specified in the State law, it shall be stated in percentage of 
alcohol by weight or by volume, and not by proof or by maximums or 
minimums. Otherwise the manner of statement shall be as specified in the 
State law.
    (b) The terms ``low alcohol'' or ``reduced alcohol'' may be used 
only on malt beverage products containing less than 2.5 percent alcohol 
by volume.
    (c) The term ``non-alcoholic'' may be used on malt beverage 
products, provided the statement ``contains less than 0.5 percent (or 
.5%) alcohol by volume'' appears in direct conjunction with it, in 
readily legible printing and on a completely contrasting background.

<R05>
Sec. 7.29  Prohibited practices.

    (a) Statements on labels. Containers of malt beverages, or any 
labels on such containers, or any carton, case, or individual covering 
of such containers, used for sale at retail, or any written, printed, 
graphic, or other material accompanying such containers to the consumer, 
must not contain:
    (1) Any statement that is false or untrue in any particular, or 
that, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, omission, or 
inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific or technical 
matter, tends to create a misleading impression.
    (2) Any statement that is disparaging of a competitor's products.
    (3) Any statement, design, device, or representation which is 
obscene or indecent.
    (4) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating 
to analyses, standards, or tests, irrespective of falsity, which the 
appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer.
    (5) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating 
to any guarantee, irrespective of falsity, which the appropriate TTB 
officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer. Money-back 
guarantees are not prohibited.
    (6) A trade or brand name that is the name of any living individual 
of public prominence, or existing private or public organization, or is 
a name that is in simulation or is an abbreviation thereof, or any 
graphic, pictorial, or emblematic representation of any such individual 
or organization, if the use of such name or representation is likely 
falsely to lead the consumer to believe that the product has been 
endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision 
of, or in accordance with the specifications of, such individual or 
organization: Provided, That this paragraph shall not apply to

[[Page 101]]

the use of the name of any person engaged in business as a producer, 
importer, bottler, packer, wholesaler, retailer, or warehouseman, of 
malt beverages, nor to the use by any person of a trade or brand name 
that is the name of any living individual of public prominence, or 
existing private or public organization, provided such trade or brand 
name was used by him or his predecessors in interest prior to August 29, 
1935.
    (7) Any statement, design, device, or representation that tends to 
create a false or misleading impression that the malt beverage contains 
distilled spirits or is a distilled spirits product. This paragraph does 
not prohibit the following on malt beverage labels:
    (i) A truthful and accurate statement of alcohol content, in 
conformity with Sec. 7.71;
    (ii) The use of a brand name of a distilled spirits product as a 
malt beverage brand name, provided that the overall label does not 
present a misleading impression about the identity of the product; or
    (iii) The use of a cocktail name as a brand name or fanciful name of 
a malt beverage, provided that the overall label does not present a 
misleading impression about the identity of the product.
    (b) Simulation of Government stamps. No label shall be of such 
design as to resemble or simulate a stamp of the United States 
Government or of any State or foreign government. No label, other than 
stamps authorized or required by the United States Government or any 
State or foreign government, shall state or indicate that the malt 
beverage contained in the labeled container is brewed, made, bottled, 
packed, labeled, or sold under, or in accordance with, any municipal, 
State, Federal, or foreign government authorization, law, or regulation, 
unless such statement is required or specifically authorized by Federal, 
State, or municipal, law or regulation, or is required or specifically 
authorized by the laws or regulations of the foreign country in which 
such malt beverages were produced. If the municipal or State government 
permit number is stated upon a label, it shall not be accompanied by an 
additional statement relating thereto, unless required by State law.
    (c) Use of word ``bonded'', etc. The words ``bonded'', ``bottled in 
bond'', ``aged in bond'', ``bonded age'', ``bottled under customs 
supervision'', or phrases containing these or synonymous terms which 
imply governmental supervision over production, bottling, or packing, 
shall not be used on any label for malt beverages.
    (d) Flags, seals, coats of arms, crests, and other insignia. Labels 
shall not contain, in the brand name or otherwise, any statement, 
design, device, or pictorial representation which the appropriate TTB 
officer finds relates to, or is capable of being construed as relating 
to, the armed forces of the United States, or the American flag, or any 
emblem, seal, insignia, or decoration associated with such flag or armed 
forces; nor shall any label contain any statement, design, device, or 
pictorial representation of or concerning any flag, seal, coat of arms, 
crest or other insignia, likely to mislead the consumer to believe that 
the product has been endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or 
under the supervision of, or in accordance with the specifications of 
the government, organization, family, or individual with whom such flag, 
seal, coat of arms, crest, or insignia is associated.
    (e) Health-related statements--(1) Definitions. When used in this 
paragraph (e), terms are defined as follows:
    (i) Health-related statement means any statement related to health 
(other than the warning statement required by Sec. 16.21 of this 
chapter) and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature 
that, expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the 
consumption of alcohol, malt beverages, or any substance found within 
the malt beverage, and health benefits or effects on health. The term 
includes both specific health claims and general references to alleged 
health benefits or effects on health associated with the consumption of 
alcohol, malt beverages, or any substance found within the malt 
beverage, as well as health-related directional statements. The term 
also includes statements and claims

[[Page 102]]

that imply that a physical or psychological sensation results from 
consuming the malt beverage, as well as statements and claims of 
nutritional value (e.g., statements of vitamin content). Statements 
concerning caloric, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content do not 
constitute nutritional claims about the product.
    (ii) Specific health claim is a type of health-related statement 
that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the 
malt beverage, alcohol, or any substance found within the malt beverage, 
to a disease or health-related condition. Implied specific health claims 
include statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication 
that suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a 
relationship exists between malt beverages, alcohol, or any substance 
found within the malt beverage, and a disease or health-related 
condition.
    (iii) Health-related directional statement is a type of health-
related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or 
other source for information regarding the effects on health of malt 
beverage or alcohol consumption.
    (2) Rules for labeling--(i) Health-related statements. In general, 
labels may not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in 
any particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the 
effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will evaluate such 
statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part of the 
health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying statement 
to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related 
statement.
    (ii) Specific health claims. (A) TTB will consult with the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), as needed, on the use of a specific health 
claim on a malt beverage label. If FDA determines that the use of such a 
labeling claim is a drug claim that is not in compliance with the 
requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, TTB will not 
approve the use of that specific health claim on a malt beverage label.
    (B) TTB will approve the use of a specific health claim on a malt 
beverage label only if the claim is truthful and adequately 
substantiated by scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed 
and qualified with respect to the categories of individuals to whom the 
claim applies; adequately discloses the health risks associated with 
both moderate and heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines 
the categories of individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption 
may cause health risks. This information must appear as part of the 
specific health claim.
    (iii) Health-related directional statements. A statement that 
directs consumers to a third party or other source for information 
regarding the effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption 
is presumed misleading unless it--
    (A) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to 
a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the 
effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption; and
    (B)(1) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement 
the following disclaimer: ``This statement should not encourage you to 
drink or to increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons;'' or
    (2) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement 
some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds 
is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the 
health-related directional statement.
    (f) Use of words ``strong,'' ``full strength,'' and similar words. 
Labels shall not contain the words ``strong,'' ``full strength,'' 
``extra strength,'' ``high test,'' ``high proof,'' ``pre-war strength,'' 
``full oldtime alcoholic strength,'' or similar words or statements, 
likely to be considered as statements of alcoholic content, unless 
required by State law. This does not preclude use of the terms ``low 
alcohol,'' ``reduced alcohol,'' ``non-alcoholic,'' and ``alcohol-free,'' 
in accordance with Sec. 7.71 (d), (e), and (f), nor does it preclude 
labeling with the alcohol content in accordance with Sec. 7.71.
    (g) Use of numerals. Labels shall not contain any statements, 
designs, or devices, whether in the form of numerals, letters, 
characters, figures, or otherwise, which are likely to be considered

[[Page 103]]

as statements of alcoholic content, unless required by State law, or as 
permitted by Sec. 7.71.
    (h) Coverings, cartons, or cases. Individual coverings, cartons, 
cases, or other wrappers of containers of malt beverages, used for sale 
at retail, or any written, printed, graphic, or other matter 
accompanying the container shall not contain any statement or any 
graphic pictorial, or emblematic representation, or other matter, which 
is prohibited from appearing on any label or container of malt 
beverages.

``ale,'' ``porter,'' or ``stout'' and produced without the use of 
coloring or flavoring materials (other than those recognized in standard 
brewing practices) shall be designated in any advertisement by any of 
these class designations.
    (e) Health-related statements--(1) Definitions. When used in this 
paragraph (e), terms are defined as follows:
    (i) Health-related statement means any statement related to health 
and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature that, 
expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the 
consumption of alcohol, malt beverages, or any substance found within 
the malt beverage, and health benefits or effects on health. The term 
includes both specific health claims and general references to alleged 
health benefits or effects on health associated with the consumption of 
alcohol, malt beverages, or any substance found within the malt 
beverage, as well as health-related directional statements. The term 
also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical or 
psychological sensation results from consuming the malt beverage, as 
well as statements and claims of nutritional value (e.g., statements of 
vitamin content). Statements concerning caloric, carbohydrate, protein, 
and fat content do not constitute nutritional claims about the product.
    (ii) Specific health claim is a type of health-related statement 
that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the 
malt beverage, alcohol, or any substance found within the malt beverage, 
to a disease or health-related condition. Implied specific health claims 
include statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication 
that suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a 
relationship exists between malt beverages, alcohol, or any substance 
found within the malt beverage, and a disease or health-related 
condition.
    (iii) Health-related directional statement is a type of health-
related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or 
other source for information regarding the effects on health of malt 
beverage or alcohol consumption.
    (2) Rules for advertising--(i) Health-related statements. In 
general, advertisements may not contain any health-related statement 
that is untrue in any particular or tends to create a misleading 
impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB

[[Page 107]]

will evaluate such statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as 
part of the health-related statement a disclaimer or some other 
qualifying statement to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the 
health-related statement. Such disclaimer or other qualifying statement 
must appear as prominent as the health-related statement.
    (ii) Specific health claims. A specific health claim will not be 
considered misleading if it is truthful and adequately substantiated by 
scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed and qualified with 
respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; 
adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and 
heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of 
individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health 
risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim 
and in a manner as prominent as the specific health claim.
    (iii) Health-related directional statements. A statement that 
directs consumers to a third party or other source for information 
regarding the effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption 
is presumed misleading unless it--
    (A) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to 
a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the 
effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption; and
    (B)(1) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, 
and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional 
statement, the following disclaimer: ``This statement should not 
encourage you to drink or increase your alcohol consumption for health 
reasons;'' or
    (2) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, 
and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional 
statement, some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB 
officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed 
by the health-related directional statement.
    (f) Confusion of brands. Two or more different brands or lots of 
malt beverages shall not be advertised in one advertisement (or in two 
or more advertisements in one issue of a periodical or a newspaper or in 
one piece of other written, printed, or graphic matter) if the 
advertisement tends to create the impression that representations made 
as to one brand or lot apply to the other or others, and if as to such 
latter the representations contravene any provision of Sec. Sec. 7.50 
through 7.54 or are in any respect untrue.
    (g) Flags, seals, coats of arms, crests, and other insignia. No 
advertisement shall contain any statement, design, device, or pictorial 
representation of or relating to, or capable of being construed as 
relating to the armed forces of the United States, or of the American 
flag, or of any emblem, seal, insignia, or decoration associated with 
such flag or armed forces; nor shall any advertisement contain any 
statement, device, design, or pictorial representation of or concerning 
any flag, seal, coat of arms, crest, or other insignia, likely to 
mislead the consumer to believe that the product has been endorsed, 
made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision of, or in 
accordance with the specifications of the government, organization, 
family, or individual with whom such flag, seal, coat of arms, crest, or 
insignia is associated.
    (h) Deceptive advertising techniques. Subliminal or similar 
techniques are prohibited. ``Subliminal or similar techniques,'' as used 
in this part, refers to any device or technique that is used to convey, 
or attempts to convey, a message to a person by means of images or 
sounds of a very brief nature that cannot be perceived at a normal level 
of awareness.

<R04>
     Subpart H_Interim Regulations for Alcoholic Content Statements


<R05>
Sec. 7.71  Alcoholic content.

    (a) General. Alcoholic content and the percentage and quantity of 
the original gravity or extract may be stated on a label unless 
prohibited by State law. When alcoholic content is stated, and the 
manner of statement is not required under State law, it shall be stated 
as prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Form of statement. (1) Statement of alcoholic content shall be 
expressed in percent alcohol by volume, and not by percent by weight, 
proof, or by maximums or minimums.
    (2) For malt beverages containing 0.5 percent or more alcohol by 
volume, statements of alcoholic content shall be expressed to the 
nearest one-tenth of a percent, subject to the tolerance permitted by 
paragraph (c) (1) and (2) of this section. For malt beverages containing 
less than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume, alcoholic content may be 
expressed in one-hundredths of a percent, subject to the tolerance 
permitted in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (3) Alcoholic content shall be expressed in the following fashion: 
``alcohol--percent by volume,'' ``alcohol by volume--percent,'' ``--
percent alcohol by volume,'' or ``--percent alcohol/volume.'' The 
abbreviations ``alc'' and ``vol'' may be used in lieu of the words 
``alcohol'' and ``volume,'' and the symbol ``%'' may be used in lieu of 
the word ``percent.''
    (c) Tolerances. (1) For malt beverages containing 0.5 percent or 
more alcohol by volume, a tolerance of 0.3 percent will be permitted, 
either above or below the stated percentage of alcohol. Any malt 
beverage which is labeled as containing 0.5 percent or more alcohol by 
volume may not contain less than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume, 
regardless of any tolerance.
    (2) For malt beverages which are labeled as ``low alcohol'' or 
``reduced alcohol'' under paragraph (d) of this section, the actual 
alcoholic content may not equal or exceed 2.5 percent alcohol by volume, 
regardless of any tolerance permitted by paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section.
    (3) For malt beverages containing less than 0.5 percent alcohol by 
volume, the actual alcoholic content may not exceed the labeled 
alcoholic content. A malt beverage may not be labeled with an alcoholic 
content of 0.0 percent alcohol by volume unless it is also labeled as 
``alcohol free'' and contains no alcohol.
    (d) Low alcohol and reduced alcohol. The terms ``low alcohol'' or 
``reduced alcohol'' may be used only on malt beverages containing less 
than 2.5 percent alcohol by volume.
    (e) Non-alcoholic. The term ``non-alcoholic'' may be used on malt 
beverages, provided the statement ``contains less than 0.5 percent (or 
.5%) alcohol by volume'' appears in direct conjunction with it, in 
readily legible printing and on a completely contrasting background.
    (f) Alcohol free. The term ``alcohol free'' may be used only on malt 
beverages containing no alcohol.

[T.D. ATF-339, 58 FR 21232, Apr. 19, 1993]


<R04>
                  Subpart I_Use of the Term ``Organic''


<R05>
Sec. 7.81  Use of the term ``organic.''

    (a) Use of the term ``organic'' is optional and is treated as 
``additional information on labels'' under Sec. 7.28(e).

[[Page 109]]

    (b) Any use of the term ``organic'' on a malt beverage label or in 
advertising of malt beverages must comply with the United States 
Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Organic Program rules (7 CFR 
part 205) as interpreted by the USDA.
    (c) This section applies to labels and advertising that use the term 
``organic'' on and after October 21, 2002.

<R04>
                     Subpart C_Prohibited Practices


<R05>
Sec. 8.21  General.

    It is unlawful for an industry member to require, by agreement or 
otherwise, that any retailer purchase distilled spirits, wine, or malt 
beverages from the industry member to the exclusion, in whole or in 
part, of products sold or offered for sale by other persons in 
interstate or foreign commerce. This prohibition includes purchases 
coerced by industry members, through acts or threats of physical or 
economic harm, as well as voluntary industry member-retailer purchase 
agreements.


<R05>
Sec. 8.22  Contracts to purchase distilled spirits, wine, or malt 
beverages.

    Any contract or agreement, written or unwritten, which has the 
effect of requiring the retailer to purchase distilled spirits, wine, or 
malt beverages from the industry member beyond a single sales 
transaction is prohibited. Examples of such contracts are:
    (a) An advertising contract between an industry member and a 
retailer with the express or implied requirement of the purchase of the 
advertiser's products; or
    (b) A sales contract awarded on a competitive bid basis which has 
the effect of prohibiting the retailer from purchasing from other 
industry members by:
    (1) Requiring that for the period of the agreement, the retailer 
purchase a product or line of products exclusively from the industry 
member; or
    (2) Requiring that the retailer purchase a specific or minimum 
quantity during the period of the agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 8.23  Third party arrangements.

    Industry member requirements, by agreement or otherwise, with non-
retailers which result in a retailer being required to purchase the 
industry member's products are within the exclusive outlet provisions. 
These industry member requirements are covered whether the agreement or 
other arrangement originates with the industry member or the third 
party. For example, a supplier enters into a contractual agreement or 
other arrangement with a third party. This agreement or arrangement 
contains an industry member requirement as described above. The third 
party, a ballclub, or municipal or private corporation, not acting as a 
retailer, leases the concession rights and is able to control the 
purchasing decisions of the retailer. The third party, as a result of 
the requirement, by agreement or otherwise, with the industry member, 
requires the retailer to purchase the industry member's products to the 
exclusion, in whole or in part, of products sold or offered for sale by 
other persons in interstate or foreign commerce. The business 
arrangements entered into by the industry member and the third party may 
consist of such things as sponsoring radio or television broadcasting, 
paying for advertising, or providing other services or things of value.

noted.


<R05>
Sec. 8.51  Exclusion, in general.

    (a) Exclusion, in whole or in part occurs:

[[Page 112]]

    (1) When a practice by an industry member, whether direct, indirect, 
or through an affiliate, places (or has the potential to place) retailer 
independence at risk by means of a tie or link between the industry 
member and retailer or by any other means of industry member control 
over the retailer, and
    (2) Such practice results in the retailer purchasing less than it 
would have of a competitor's product.
    (b) Section 8.52 lists practices that result in exclusion. Section 
8.53 lists practices not resulting in exclusion. Section 8.54 lists the 
criteria used for determining whether other practices can put retailer 
independence at risk.


<R05>
Sec. 8.52  Practices which result in exclusion.

    The practices specified in this section result in exclusion under 
section 105(a) of the Act. The practices specified here are examples and 
do not constitute a complete list of such practices:
    (a) Purchases of distilled spirits, wine or malt beverages by a 
retailer as a result, directly or indirectly, of a threat or act of 
physical or economic harm by the selling industry member.
    (b) Contracts between an industry member and a retailer which 
require the retailer to purchase distilled spirits, wine, or malt 
beverages from that industry member and expressly restrict the retailer 
from purchasing, in whole or in part, such products from another 
industry member.


<R05>
Sec. 8.53  Practice not resulting in exclusion.

    The practice specified in this section is deemed not to result in 
exclusion under section 105(a) of the Act: a supply contract for one 
year or less between the industry member and retailer under which the 
industry member agrees to sell distilled spirits, wine, or malt 
beverages to the retailer on an ``as needed'' basis provided that the 
retailer is not required to purchase any minimum quantity of such 
product.


<R05>
Sec. 8.54  Criteria for determining retailer independence.

    The criteria specified in this section are indications that a 
particular practice, other than those in Sec. Sec. 8.52 and 8.53, 
places retailer independence at risk. A practice need not meet all of 
the criteria specified in this section in order to place retailer 
independence at risk.
    (a) The practice restricts or hampers the free economic choice of a 
retailer to decide which products to purchase or the quantity in which 
to purchase them for sale to consumers.
    (b) The industry member obligates the retailer to participate in the 
promotion to obtain the industry member's product.
    (c) The retailer has a continuing obligation to purchase or 
otherwise promote the industry member's product.
    (d) The retailer has a commitment not to terminate its relationship 
with the industry member with respect to purchase of the industry 
member's products.
    (e) The practice involves the industry member in the day-to-day 
operations of the retailer. For example, the industry member controls 
the retailer's decisions on which brand of products to purchase, the 
pricing of products, or the manner in which the products will be 
displayed on the retailer's premises.
    (f) The practice is discriminatory in that it is not offered to all 
retailers in the local market on the same terms without business reasons 
present to justify the difference in treatment.

<R05>
Sec. 9.12  AVA petition requirements.

    (a) Establishment of an AVA in general. A petition for the 
establishment of a new AVA must include all of the evidentiary materials 
and other information specified in this section. The petition must 
contain sufficient information, data, and evidence such that no 
independent verification or research is required by TTB.
    (1) Name evidence. The name identified for the proposed AVA must be 
currently and directly associated with an area in which viticulture 
exists. All of the area within the proposed AVA boundary must be 
nationally or locally known by the name specified in the petition, 
although the use of that name may extend beyond the proposed AVA 
boundary. The name evidence must conform to the following rules:
    (i) Name usage. The petition must completely explain, in narrative 
form, the manner in which the name is used

[[Page 116]]

for the area covered by the proposed AVA.
    (ii) Source of name and name evidence. The name and the evidence in 
support of it must come from sources independent of the petitioner. 
Appropriate name evidence sources include, but are not limited to, 
historical and modern government or commercial maps, books, newspapers, 
magazines, tourist and other promotional materials, local business or 
school names, and road names. Whenever practicable, the petitioner must 
include with the petition copies of the name evidence materials, 
appropriately cross-referenced in the petition narrative. Although 
anecdotal information by itself is not sufficient, statements taken from 
local residents with knowledge of the name and its use may also be 
included to support other name evidence.
    (2) Boundary evidence. The petition must explain in detail the basis 
for defining the boundary of the proposed AVA as set forth in the 
petition. This explanation must have reference to the name evidence and 
other distinguishing features information required under this section. 
In support of the proposed boundary, the petition must outline the 
commonalities or similarities within that boundary and must explain with 
specificity how those elements are different in the adjacent areas 
outside that boundary.
    (3) Distinguishing features. The petition must provide, in narrative 
form, a description of the common or similar features of the proposed 
AVA affecting viticulture that make it distinctive. The petition must 
also explain with specificity in what way these features affect 
viticulture and how they are distinguished viticulturally from features 
associated with adjacent areas outside the proposed AVA boundary. For 
purposes of this section, information relating to distinguishing 
features affecting viticulture includes the following:
    (i) Climate. Temperature, precipitation, wind, fog, solar 
orientation and radiation, and other climate information;
    (ii) Geology. Underlying formations, landforms, and such geophysical 
events as earthquakes, eruptions, and major floods;
    (iii) Soils. Soil series or phases of a soil series, denoting parent 
material, texture, slope, permeability, soil reaction, drainage, and 
fertility;
    (iv) Physical features. Flat, hilly, or mountainous topography, 
geographical formations, bodies of water, watersheds, irrigation 
resources, and other physical features; and
    (v) Elevation. Minimum and maximum elevations.
    (4) Maps and boundary description. --(i) Maps. The petitioner must 
submit with the petition, in an appropriate scale, the U.S.G.S. map(s) 
showing the location of the proposed AVA. The exact boundary of the AVA 
must be prominently and clearly drawn on the maps without obscuring the 
underlying features that define the boundary line. U.S.G.S. maps may be 
obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey, Branch of Distribution. If the 
map name is not known, the petitioner may request a map index by State.
    (ii) Boundary description. The petition must include a detailed 
narrative description of the proposed AVA boundary based on U.S.G.S. map 
markings. This description must have a specific beginning point, must 
proceed unbroken from that point in a clockwise direction, and must 
return to that beginning point to complete the boundary description. The 
boundary description must refer to easily discernable reference points 
on the U.S.G.S. maps. The proposed AVA boundary description may rely on 
any of the following map features:
    (A) State, county, township, forest, and other political entity 
lines;
    (B) Highways, roads (including unimproved roads), and trails;
    (C) Contour or elevation lines;
    (D) Natural geographical features, including rivers, streams, 
creeks, ridges, and marked elevation points (such as summits or 
benchmarks);
    (E) Human-made features (such as bridges, buildings, windmills, or 
water tanks); and
    (F) Straight lines between marked intersections, human-made 
features, or other map points.
    (b) AVAs within AVAs. If the petition proposes the establishment of 
a new AVA entirely within, or overlapping,

[[Page 117]]

an existing AVA, the evidence submitted under paragraph (a) of this 
section must include information that both identifies the attributes of 
the proposed AVA that are consistent with the existing AVA and explains 
how the proposed AVA is sufficiently distinct from the existing AVA and 
therefore appropriate for separate recognition. If the petition proposes 
the establishment of a new AVA that is larger than, and encompasses, all 
of one or more existing AVAs, the evidence submitted under paragraph (a) 
of this section must include information addressing whether, and to what 
extent, the attributes of the proposed AVA are consistent with those of 
the existing AVA(s). In any case in which an AVA would be created 
entirely within another AVA, whether by the establishment of a new, 
larger AVA or by the establishment of a new AVA within an existing one, 
the petition must explain why establishment of the AVA is acceptable. 
When a smaller AVA has name recognition and features that so clearly 
distinguish it from a larger AVA that surrounds it, TTB may determine in 
the course of the rulemaking that it is not part of the larger AVA and 
that wine produced from grapes grown within the smaller AVA would not be 
entitled to use the name of the larger AVA as an appellation of origin 
or in a brand name.
    (c) Modification of an existing AVA.--(1) Boundary change. If a 
petition seeks to change the boundary of an existing AVA, the petitioner 
must include with the petition all relevant evidence and other 
information specified for a new AVA petition in paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section. This evidence or information must include, at a 
minimum, the following:
    (i) Name evidence. If the proposed change involves an expansion of 
the existing boundary, the petition must show how the name of the 
existing AVA also applies to the expansion area. If the proposed change 
would result in a decrease in the size of an existing AVA, the petition 
must explain, if so, the extent to which the AVA name does not apply to 
the excluded area.
    (ii) Distinguishing features. The petition must demonstrate that the 
area covered by the proposed change has, or does not have, 
distinguishing features affecting viticulture that are essentially the 
same as those of the existing AVA. If the proposed change involves an 
expansion of the existing AVA, the petition must demonstrate that the 
area covered by the expansion has the same distinguishing features as 
those of the existing AVA and has different features from those of the 
area outside the proposed, new boundary. If the proposed change would 
result in a decrease in the size of an existing AVA, the petition must 
explain how the distinguishing features of the excluded area are 
different from those within the boundary of the smaller AVA. In all 
cases the distinguishing features must affect viticulture.
    (iii) Boundary evidence and description. The petition must explain 
how the boundary of the existing AVA was incorrectly or incompletely 
defined or is no longer accurate due to new evidence or changed 
circumstances, with reference to the name evidence and distinguishing 
features of the existing AVA and of the area affected by the proposed 
boundary change. The petition must include the appropriate U.S.G.S. maps 
with the proposed boundary change drawn on them and must provide a 
detailed narrative description of the changed boundary.
    (2) Name change. If a petition seeks to change the name of an 
existing AVA, the petition must establish the suitability of that name 
change by providing the name evidence specified in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section.


<R05>
Sec. 9.13  Initial processing of AVA petitions.

    (a) TTB notification to petitioner of petition receipt. The 
appropriate TTB officer will acknowledge receipt of a submitted 
petition. This notification will be in a letter sent to the petitioner 
within 30 days of receipt of the petition.
    (b) Acceptance of a perfected petition or return of a deficient 
petition to the petitioner. The appropriate TTB officer will perform an 
initial review of the petition to determine whether it is a perfected 
petition. If the petition is not perfected, the appropriate TTB officer 
will return it to the petitioner without

[[Page 118]]

prejudice to resubmission in perfected form. If the petition is 
perfected, TTB will decide whether to proceed with rulemaking under 
Sec. 9.14 and will advise the petitioner in writing of that decision. 
If TTB decides to proceed with rulemaking, TTB will advise the 
petitioner of the date of receipt of the perfected petition. If TTB 
decides not to proceed with rulemaking, TTB will advise the petitioner 
of the reasons for that decision.
    (c) Notice of pending petition. When a perfected petition is 
accepted for rulemaking, TTB will place a notice to that effect on the 
TTB Web site.


<R05>
Sec. 9.14  AVA rulemaking process.

    (a) Notice of proposed rulemaking. If TTB determines that rulemaking 
in response to a petition is appropriate, TTB will prepare and publish a 
notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register to solicit 
public comments on the petitioned-for AVA action.
    (b) Final action. Following the close of the NPRM comment period, 
TTB will review any submitted comments and any other available relevant 
information and will take one of the following actions:
    (1) Prepare a final rule for publication in the Federal Register 
adopting the proposed AVA action, with or without changes;
    (2) Prepare a notice for publication in the Federal Register 
withdrawing the proposal and setting forth the reasons for the 
withdrawal. Reasons for withdrawal of a proposal must include at least 
one of the following:
    (i) The extent of viticulture within the proposed boundary is not 
sufficient to constitute a grape-growing region as specified in Sec. 
9.11(a); or
    (ii) The name, boundary, or distinguishing features evidence does 
not meet the standards for such evidence set forth in Sec. 9.12; or
    (iii) The petitioned-for action would be inconsistent with one of 
the purposes of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act or any other 
Federal statute or regulation or would be otherwise contrary to the 
public interest;
    (3) Prepare a new NPRM for publication in the Federal Register 
setting forth a modified AVA action for public comment; or
    (4) Take any other action deemed appropriate by TTB as authorized by 
law.

<R04>
                      Subpart C_Commercial Bribery


<R05>
Sec. 10.21  Commercial bribery.

    It is unlawful for an industry member, directly or indirectly or 
through an affiliate, to induce a trade buyer to purchase the industry 
member's products, to the complete or partial exclusion of products sold 
or offered for sale by other persons in interstate or foreign commerce, 
by offering or giving a bonus, premium, compensation, or other thing of 
value to any officer, employee, or representative of the trade buyer. 
The bonus, premium, compensation, or other thing of value need not be 
offered or given for the purpose of directly inducing a trade buyer to 
purchase from the seller, but rather is applicable if an industry member 
induces officers, employees or representatives of the trade buyer to 
promote sales of the industry member's products and thereby indirectly 
induces the trade buyer to purchase from the industry member.


<R05>
Sec. 10.22  Employee associations.

    Gifts, donations, and other payments such as for advertising in 
publications, by an industry member, to trade buyer employee 
associations are considered the same as bonuses, premiums, compensation, 
or other things of value given directly to the employees, since the 
benefits resulting from the gifts or payments flow to the individual 
members of the association.


<R05>
Sec. 10.23  Gifts or payments to wholesalers.

    Although industry members are not prohibited from offering or giving 
money or other things of value to a wholesale entity (i.e., the 
corporation, partnership, or individual who owns the business), the 
wholesaler will be considered as acting as a mere conduit between its 
officers, employees, or representatives and the industry member, if:
    (a) There is an agreement or understanding, implied or explicit, 
that the money or thing of value will be passed on to the officers, 
employees, or representatives, or
    (b) It is obvious by the very nature of the item given (such as a 
free trip) that a pass through to the officers, employees, or 
representatives is clearly contemplated, or
    (c) The records of the recipient wholesaler do not accurately 
reflect such money or item as an asset or the wholesale entity, thus 
being subject to all ensuing tax consequences as distinguished from the 
receipt of the money or item as a personal asset of an officer, 
employee, or representative.


<R05>
Sec. 10.24  Sales promotion contests.

    Sales contests sponsored by an industry member which offer prizes 
directly or indirectly to trade buyer officers,

[[Page 318]]

employees or representatives are inducements within the meaning of the 
Act.

    Source: T.D. ATF-364, 60 FR 20427, Apr. 26, 1995, unless otherwise 
noted.


<R05>
Sec. 10.51  Exclusion, in general.

    (a) Exclusion, in whole or in part occurs:
    (1) When a practice by an industry member, whether direct, indirect, 
or through an affiliate, places (or has the potential to place) trade 
buyer independence at risk by means of a tie or link between the 
industry member and trade buyer or by any other means of industry member 
control over the trade buyer, and
    (2) Such practice results in the trade buyer purchasing less than it 
would have of a competitor's product.
    (b) Section 10.52 lists practices that create a tie or link that 
places trade buyer independence at risk. Section 10.53 is reserved and 
will list practices not resulting in exclusion. Section 10.54 lists the 
criteria used for determining whether other practices can put trade 
buyer independence at risk.


<R05>
Sec. 10.52  Practice which puts trade buyer independence at risk.

    The practice specified in this section is deemed to place trade 
buyer independence at risk within the description of exclusion in Sec. 
10.51: Industry member payments of money to the employee(s) of a trade 
buyer without the knowledge or consent of the trade buyer-employer in 
return for the employee agreeing to order distilled spirits, wine, or 
malt beverages from the industry member. The practice enumerated here is 
an example and does not constitute a complete list of those situations 
which result in such control.


<R05>
Sec. 10.53  Practices not resulting in exclusion. [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 10.54  Criteria for determining trade buyer independence.

    The criteria specified in this section are indications that a 
particular practice between an industry member and an officer, employee, 
or representative of a trade buyer, other than those in Sec. 10.52, 
places trade buyer independence at risk. A practice need not meet all of 
the criteria specified in this section in order to place trade buyer 
independence at risk.
    (a) The practice restricts or hampers the free economic choice of a 
trade buyer to decide which products to purchase or the quantity in 
which to purchase them for sale to retailers and consumers.
    (b) The industry member obligates the trade buyer to participate in 
the promotion to obtain the industry member's product.
    (c) The trade buyer has a continuing obligation to purchase or 
otherwise promote the industry member's product.
    (d) The trade buyer has a commitment not to terminate its 
relationship with the industry member with respect to purchase of the 
industry member's products.
    (e) The practice involves the industry member in the day-to-day 
operations of the trade buyer. For example, the industry member controls 
the trade buyer's decisions on which brand of products to purchase, the 
pricing of products, or the manner in which the products will be 
displayed on the trade buyer's premises.
    (f) The practice is discriminatory in that it is not offered to all 
trade buyers in the local market on the same terms without business 
reasons present to justify the difference in treatment.

[[Page 329]]


<R05>
Sec. 13.25  Appeal of qualification or denial.

    (a) Form of appeal. If an applicant for a certificate of label 
approval, certificate of exemption from label approval, or distinctive 
liquor bottle approval wishes to appeal the qualified approval or denial 
of an application, the applicant may file a written appeal with the 
appropriate TTB officer within 45 days after the date of the notice of 
qualification or denial. The appeal should explain why the applicant 
believes that the label or bottle is in compliance with applicable laws 
and regulations. If no appeal is filed within 45 days after the date of 
the notice of qualification or denial, the notice will be the final 
decision of TTB.
    (b) Informal resolution. Applicants may choose to pursue informal 
resolution of disagreements regarding correction sheets or 
qualifications by requesting an informal conference with the appropriate 
TTB officer. However, formal administrative appeals must comply with the 
provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 13.26  Decision after appeal of qualification or denial.

    (a) Decision. After considering any written arguments or evidence 
presented by the applicant, the appropriate TTB officer must issue a 
written decision to the applicant. If the decision is that the qualified 
approval or denial should stand, a copy of the application, marked 
``appeal denied,'' must be returned to the applicant with an explanation 
of the decision and the specific laws or regulations relied upon in 
qualifying or denying the application. If the decision is that the 
certificate of label approval, certificate of exemption from label 
approval, or distinctive liquor bottle application should be approved 
without qualification, the applicant should resubmit TTB Form 5100.31 
and the certificate will be issued.
    (b) Time limits for decision. Within 90 days of receipt of an 
appeal, the appropriate TTB officer must notify the appellant whether 
the appeal has been granted or denied. If an applicant requests an 
informal conference as part of an appeal, as authorized in Sec. 13.71, 
the 90-day period will begin 10 days after the date of the conference to 
allow for consideration of any written arguments, facts or evidence 
submitted after the conference. The appropriate TTB officer may extend 
this period of time once by an additional 90 days if he or she finds 
that unusual circumstances require additional time to consider the 
issues presented by an appeal. If the appropriate TTB officer extends 
the period, he or she must notify the applicant by letter, briefly 
explaining the issues presented by the label. If the appellant receives 
no decision from the appropriate TTB officer within the time periods set 
forth in this paragraph, the appellant may appeal as provided in Sec. 
13.27.
    (c) Judicial review. Prior to applying to the Federal courts for 
review, an applicant must first exhaust his or her administrative 
remedies, including the appeal rights set forth in this section and 
Sec. 13.27.


<R05>
Sec. 13.27  Second appeal of qualification or denial.

    (a) Form of appeal. The decision after appeal of qualification or 
denial may be appealed in writing to the appropriate TTB officer within 
45 days after the date of that decision. If the appropriate TTB officer 
concludes that the qualified approval or denial was correct, a copy of 
the application, marked ``appeal denied,'' must be returned to the 
applicant, with an explanation of the decision and the specific laws or 
regulations relied upon in qualifying or denying the application. If the 
appropriate TTB officer concludes that the certificate of label 
approval, certificate of exemption from label approval, or distinctive 
liquor bottle application should be approved without qualification, the 
applicant may resubmit TTB Form 5100.31 and the certificate will be 
issued.
    (b) Time limits for decision after second appeal. Within 90 days of 
receipt of the second appeal, the appropriate TTB officer must notify 
the appellant whether the appeal has been granted or denied. If an 
applicant requests an informal conference as part of an appeal, as 
authorized in Sec. 13.71, the 90-day period will begin 10 days after 
the date of the conference to allow for consideration

[[Page 330]]

of any written arguments, facts or evidence submitted after the 
conference. The appropriate TTB officer may extend this period of time 
once, by an additional 90 days, if he or she finds that unusual 
circumstances require additional time to consider the unique issues 
presented by an appeal. If the appropriate TTB officer extends the time 
period, he or she must notify the applicant by letter, briefly 
explaining the issues presented by the label. The decision made on the

             Subpart D_Revocations of Specific Certificates


<R05>
Sec. 13.41  Authority to revoke certificates.

    Certificates of label approval, certificates of exemption from label 
approval, and distinctive liquor bottle approvals, previously approved 
on TTB Form 5100.31, may be revoked by the appropriate TTB officer upon 
a finding that the label or bottle at issue is not in compliance with 
the applicable laws or regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 13.42  Notice of proposed revocation.

    Except as provided in Sec. 13.51, when the appropriate TTB officer 
determines that a certificate of label approval, certificate of 
exemption from label approval, or distinctive liquor bottle approval has 
been issued for a label or bottle that is not in compliance with the 
laws or regulations, he or she must issue to the certificate holder a 
notice of proposed revocation. The notice must set forth the basis for 
the proposed revocation and must provide the certificate holder with 45 
days from the date of receipt of the notice to present written arguments 
or evidence why the revocation should not occur.


<R05>
Sec. 13.43  Decision after notice of proposed revocation.

    (a) Decision. After considering any written arguments or evidence 
presented by the certificate holder, the appropriate TTB officer must 
issue a decision. If the decision is to revoke the certificate, a letter 
must be sent to the holder explaining the revocation of the certificate, 
and the specific laws or regulations relied upon in determining that the 
label or bottle was not in conformance with law or regulations. If the 
decision is to withdraw the proposed revocation, a letter of explanation 
must be sent.
    (b) Time limits for decision. Within 90 days of receipt of written 
arguments or evidence from the certificate holder, the appropriate TTB 
officer shall notify the appellant of his or her decision. If a 
certificate holder requests an informal conference as part of an appeal, 
as authorized in Sec. 13.71, the 90-day period will begin 10 days after 
the date of the conference to allow for consideration of any written 
arguments, facts or evidence submitted after the conference. The 
appropriate TTB officer may extend this period of time once by an 
additional 90 days if he or she finds that unusual circumstances require 
additional time to consider the issues presented by a proposed 
revocation. If the appropriate TTB officer extends the time period, he 
or she must notify the applicant by letter, along with a brief 
explanation of the issues under consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 13.44  Appeal of revocation.

    (a) Filing of appeal. A certificate holder who wishes to appeal the 
decision to revoke a certificate of label approval, certificate of 
exemption from label approval, or distinctive liquor bottle approval, 
may file a written appeal setting forth why the holder believes that the 
decision was erroneous. The appeal must be filed with the appropriate 
TTB officer within 45 days after the date of receipt of the decision to 
revoke a certificate of label approval, certificate of exemption from 
label approval, or distinctive liquor bottle approval.
    (b) Judicial review. An appeal to the appropriate TTB officer is 
required prior to application to the Federal

<R05>
Sec. 13.45  Final decision after appeal.

    (a) Issuance of decision. After considering any written arguments or 
evidence presented by the certificate holder or the holder's 
representative, the appropriate TTB officer must issue a final decision. 
If the decision is to revoke the certificate of label approval, 
certificate of exemption from label approval, or distinctive liquor 
bottle approval, a letter must be issued explaining the basis for the 
revocation, and the specific laws or regulations relied upon in 
determining that the label or bottle was not in conformance with law or 
regulations. If the decision is to withdraw the proposed revocation, a 
letter explaining the decision must be sent.
    (b) Time limits for decision. Within 90 days of receipt of an 
appeal, the appropriate TTB officer must notify the holder whether the 
appeal has been granted or denied. If a certificate holder requests an 
informal conference as part of an appeal, as authorized in Sec. 13.71, 
the 90-day period will begin 10 days after the date of the conference to 
allow for consideration of any written arguments, facts or evidence 
submitted after the conference. The appropriate TTB officer may extend 
this period of time once by an additional 90 days if he or she finds 
that unusual circumstances require additional time to consider the 
issues presented by an appeal. If the appropriate TTB officer extends 
the period, he or she must notify the holder by letter, briefly 
explaining the issues presented by the label. The final decision after 
appeal will be the final decision of TTB.

<R04>
         Subpart E_Revocation by Operation of Law or Regulation


<R05>
Sec. 13.51  Revocation by operation of law or regulation.

    TTB will not individually notify all holders of certificates of 
label approval, certificates of exemption from label approval, or 
distinctive liquor bottle approvals that their approvals have been 
revoked if the revocation occurs by operation of either TTB-administered 
law or regulation or applicable law or regulation of other agencies. If 
changes in labeling or other requirements are made as a result of 
amendments or revisions to the law or regulations, the certificate 
holder must voluntarily surrender all certificates that are no longer in 
compliance. The holder must submit applications for new certificates in 
compliance with the new requirements, unless TTB determines that new 
applications are not necessary. If a new application is unnecessary, it 
is the responsibility of the certificate holder to ensure that labels 
are in compliance with their requirements of the new regulations or law.

[T.D. ATF-406, 64 FR 2129, Jan. 13, 1999, as amended by T.D. ATF-483, 67 
FR 62858, Oct. 8, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 13.52  Notice of revocation.

    If TTB determines that a certificate holder is still using a 
certificate of label approval, certificate of exemption from label 
approval, or distinctive liquor bottle approval that is no longer in 
compliance due to amendments or revisions in the law or regulations, the 
appropriate TTB officer will notify the certificate holder in writing 
that the subject certificate has been revoked by operation of law or 
regulations, with a brief description of the grounds for such 
revocation.


<R05>
Sec. 13.53  Appeal of notice of revocation.

    Within 45 days after the date of receipt of a notice of revocation 
by operation of law or regulations, the certificate holder may file a 
written appeal with the appropriate TTB officer. The appeal should set 
forth the reasons why the certificate holder believes that the 
regulation or law at issue does not require the revocation of the 
certificate.


<R05>
Sec. 13.54  Decision after appeal.

    (a) Issuance of decision. After considering all written arguments 
and evidence submitted by the certificate holder, the appropriate TTB 
officer must issue a final decision regarding the revocation by 
operation of law or

[[Page 332]]

regulation of the certificate. If the decision is that the law or 
regulation at issue requires the revocation of the certificate of label 
approval, certificate of exemption from label approval, or distinctive 
liquor bottle approval, a letter must be issued explaining the basis for 
the revocation, and citing the specific laws or regulations which 
required the revocation of the certificate. If the decision is that the 
law or regulation at issue does not require the revocation of such 
certificate, a letter explaining the decision must be sent to the 
certificate holder. The decision after appeal will be the final decision 
of the TTB.
    (b) Time limits for decision. Within 90 days of receipt of an 
appeal, the appropriate TTB officer must notify the holder whether the 
appeal has been granted or denied. If a certificate holder requests an 
informal conference as part of an appeal, as authorized in Sec. 13.71, 
the 90-day period will begin 10 days after the date of the conference to 
allow for consideration of any written arguments, facts or evidence 
submitted after the conference. The appropriate TTB officer may extend 
this period of time once by an additional 90 days if he or she finds 
that unusual circumstances require additional time to consider the 
issues presented by an appeal. If the appropriate TTB officer extends 
the period, he or she must notify the holder by letter, briefly 
explaining the issues presented by the label. The decision of the 
appropriate TTB officer shall be the final decision of the TTB.

    (a) Pending and denied applications--(1) General. Pending and denied 
applications for certificates of label approval, certificates of 
exemption from label approval, or distinctive liquor bottle approvals 
are treated as proprietary information, unless the applicant or 
certificate holder provides written authorization to release such 
information.
    (2) Labels that make organic claims. TTB will disclose applications 
for approval of labels that make organic claims to the appropriate 
office of the United States Department of Agriculture to assure such 
labels comply with National Organic Program rules.

revoked.
    (d) Further disclosure of information on denied or revoked 
certificates. If an applicant whose application is pending or has been 
denied, or a holder of a revoked certificate of label approval, 
certificate of exemption from label approval, or distinctive liquor 
bottle approval, issues public statements concerning TTB action in 
connection with such application or certificate, then TTB may issue a 
statement to clarify its position or correct any misstatements of fact, 
including a disclosure of information contained on the application or 
certificate of label approval, certificate of exemption from label 
approval, or distinctive liquor bottle approval.

approval, certificate of exemption from label approval, or distinctive 
liquor bottle approval, such comments should be submitted in writing to 
the

[[Page 333]]

appropriate TTB officer who will review the subject of the comment. If 
the comment raises an issue that is outside the scope of TTB's statutory 
or regulatory authority, or the appropriate TTB officer determines that 
the certificate is in compliance with applicable law and regulations, 
the commenter will be informed that no further action will be taken. If 
the appropriate TTB officer determines that the commenter has raised a 
valid issue that TTB has authority to address, he or she will initiate 
appropriate action. The appropriate TTB officer may, in his or her 
discretion, notify the commenter as to the action being taken by TTB 
with respect to the certificate.

    (b) Informal conference procedures. The appropriate TTB officer and 
the applicant or certificate holder will agree upon a date for an 
informal conference. The informal conference is for purposes of

Sec. 17.104  Deposit of collateral.

    Except as otherwise provided by law or regulations, bonds or notes 
of the United States, or other obligations which are unconditionally 
guaranteed as to both interest and principal by the United States, may 
be pledged and deposited by principals as collateral security in lieu of 
bonds obtained from surety companies. Deposit of collateral security is 
governed by the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 9303, and 31 CFR part 225.

Sec. 17.105  Filing of powers of attorney.

    (a) Surety companies. The surety company shall prepare and submit 
with each bond, and with each consent to changes in the terms of a bond, 
a power

[[Page 343]]

of attorney in accordance with Sec. 17.6, authorizing the agent or 
officer who executed the bond or consent to act in this capacity on 
behalf of the surety. The power of attorney shall be prepared on a form 
provided by the surety company and executed under the corporate seal of 
the company. If other than a manually signed original is submitted, it 
shall be accompanied by certification of its validity.
    (b) Principal. The principal shall execute and file a power of 
attorney, in accordance with Sec. 17.6, for every person authorized to 
execute bonds on behalf of the principal.

Sec. 17.106  Consents of surety.

    The principal and surety shall execute on TTB Form 1533 (5000.18), 
Consent of Surety, any consents of surety to changes in the terms of 
bonds. Form 1533 (5000.18) shall be executed with the same formality and 
proof of authority as is required for the execution of bonds.


<R05>
Sec. 17.107  Strengthening bonds.

    Whenever the amount of a bond on file and in effect becomes 
insufficient, the principal may give a strengthening bond in a 
sufficient amount, provided the surety is the same as on the bond 
already on file and in effect; otherwise a superseding bond covering the 
entire liability shall be filed. Strengthening bonds, filed to increase 
the bond liability of the surety, shall not be construed in any sense to 
be substitute bonds, and the appropriate TTB officer shall not approve a 
strengthening bond containing any notation which may be interpreted as a 
release of any former bond or as limiting the amount of either bond to 
less than its full amount.


<R05>
Sec. 17.108  Superseding bonds.

    (a) The principal on any bond filed pursuant to this part may at any 
time replace it with a superseding bond.
    (b) Executors, administrators, assignees, receivers, trustees, or 
other persons acting in a fiduciary capacity continuing or liquidating 
the business of the principal, shall execute and file a superseding bond 
or obtain the consent of the surety or sureties on the existing bond or 
bonds.
    (c) When, in the opinion of the appropriate TTB officer, the 
interests of the Government demand it, or in any case where the security 
of the bond becomes impaired in whole or in part for any reason 
whatever, the principal shall file a superseding bond. A superseding 
bond shall be filed immediately in case of the insolvency of the surety. 
If a bond is found to be not acceptable or for any reason becomes 
invalid or of no effect, the principal shall immediately file a 
satisfactory superseding bond.
    (d) A bond filed under this section to supersede an existing bond 
shall be marked by the obligors at the time of execution, ``Superseding 
Bond.'' When such a bond is approved, the superseded bond shall be 
released as to transactions occurring wholly subsequent to the effective 
date of the superseding bond, and notice of termination of the 
superseded bond shall be issued, as provided in Sec. 17.111.

                          Termination of Bonds


<R05>
Sec. 17.111  General.

    (a) Bonds on TTB Form 5154.3 shall be terminated by the appropriate 
TTB officer, as to liability on drawback allowed after a specified 
future date, in the following circumstances:
    (1) Pursuant to a notice by the surety as provided in Sec. 17.112.
    (2) Following approval of a superseding bond, as provided in Sec. 
17.108.
    (3) Following notification by the principal of an intent to 
discontinue the filing of claims on a monthly basis.
    (b) However, the bond shall not be terminated until all outstanding 
liability under it has been discharged. Upon termination, the 
appropriate TTB officer shall mark the bond ``canceled,'' followed by 
the date of cancellation, and shall issue a notice of termination of 
bond. A copy of this notice shall be given to the principal and to each 
surety.


<R05>
Sec. 17.112  Notice by surety of termination of bond.

    A surety on any bond required by this part may at any time, in 
writing, notify the principal and the appropriate TTB officer in whose 
office the

[[Page 344]]

bond is on file that the surety desires, after a date named, to be 
relieved of liability under the bond. Unless the notice is withdrawn, in 
writing, before the date named in it, the notice shall take effect on 
that date. The date shall not be less than 60 days after the date on 
which both the notice and proof of service on the principal have been 
received by the appropriate TTB officer. The surety shall deliver one 
copy of the notice to the principal and the original to the appropriate 
TTB officer. The surety shall also file with the appropriate TTB officer 
an acknowledgment or other proof of service on the principal.


<R05>
Sec. 17.113  Extent of release of surety from liability under bond.

    The rights of the principal as supported by the bond shall cease as 
of the date when termination of the bond takes effect, and the surety 
shall be relieved from liability for drawback allowed on and after that 
date. Liability for drawback previously allowed shall continue until the 
claims for such drawback have been properly verified by the appropriate 
TTB officer according to law and this part.


<R05>
Sec. 17.114  Release of collateral.

    The release of collateral security pledged and deposited to satisfy 
the bond requirement of this part is governed by the provisions of 31 
CFR part 225. When the appropriate TTB officer determines that there is 
no outstanding liability under the bond, and is satisfied that the 
interests of the Government will not be jeopardized, the security shall 
be released and returned to the principal.

<R05>
Sec. 17.121  Product formulas.

    (a) General. Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 17.132 and 17.182, 
manufacturers shall file quantitative formulas for all preparations for 
which they intend to file drawback claims. Such formulas shall state the 
quantity of each ingredient, and shall separately state the quantity of 
spirits to be recovered or to be consumed as an essential part of the 
manufacturing process.
    (b) Filing. Formulas shall be filed on TTB Form 5154.1, Formula and 
Process for Nonbeverage Products. Filing shall be accomplished no later 
than 6 months after the end of the quarter in which taxpaid distilled 
spirits were first used to manufacture the product for purposes of 
drawback. If a product's formula is disapproved, no drawback shall be 
allowed on spirits used to manufacture that product, unless it is later 
used as an intermediate product, as provided in Sec. 17.137.
    (c) Numbering. The formulas shall be serially numbered by the 
manufacturer, commencing with number 1 and continuing thereafter in 
numerical sequence. However, a new formula for use at several plants 
shall be given the highest number next in sequence at any of those 
plants. The numbers that were skipped at the other plants shall not be 
used subsequently.
    (d) Distribution and retention of approved formulas. One copy of 
each approved Form 5154.1 shall be returned to the manufacturer. The 
formulas returned to manufacturers shall be kept in serial order at the 
place of manufacture, as provided in Sec. 17.170, and shall be made 
available to appropriate TTB officers for examination in the 
investigation of drawback claims.

<R05>
Sec. 17.122  Amended or revised formulas.

    Except as provided in this section, amended or revised formulas are 
considered to be new formulas and shall be numbered accordingly. Minor 
changes may be made to a current formula on TTB Form 5154.1 with 
retention of the original formula number, if approval is obtained from 
the appropriate TTB officer. In order to obtain approval to make a minor 
formula change, the person holding the Form 5154.1 shall submit a letter 
of application to the appropriate TTB officer, indicating the formula 
change and requesting that the proposed change be considered a minor 
change. Each such application shall clearly identify the original 
formula by number, date of approval, and name of product. The 
application shall

[[Page 345]]

indicate whether the product is, has been, or will be used in alcoholic 
beverages, and shall specify whether the proposed change is intended as 
a substitution or merely as an alternative for the original formula. No 
changes may be made to current formulas without specific TTB approval in 
each case.

<R05>
Sec. 17.123  Statement of process.

    Any person claiming drawback under the regulations in this part may 
be required, at any time, to file a statement of process, in addition to 
that required by TTB Form 5154.1, as well as any other data necessary 
for consideration of the claim for drawback. When pertinent to 
consideration of the claim, submission of copies of the commercial 
labels used on the finished products may also be required.


<R05>
Sec. 17.124  Samples.

    Any person claiming drawback or submitting a formula for approval 
under the regulations in this part may be required, at any time, to 
submit a sample of each nonbeverage or intermediate product for 
analysis. If the product is manufactured with a mixture of oil or other 
ingredients, the composition of which is unknown to the claimant, a 1-
ounce sample of the mixture shall be submitted with the sample of 
finished product when so required.


<R05>
Sec. 17.125  Adoption of formulas and processes.

    (a) Adoption of predecessor's formulas. If there is a change in the 
proprietorship of a nonbeverage plant and the successor desires to use 
the predecessor's formulas at the same location, the successor may, in 
lieu of submitting new formulas in its own name, adopt any or all of the 
formulas of the predecessor by filing a notice of adoption with the 
appropriate TTB officer. The notice shall be filed with the first claim 
relating to any of the adopted formulas. The notice shall list, by name 
and serial number, all formulas to be adopted, and shall state that the 
products will be manufactured in accordance with the adopted formulas 
and processes. The notice shall be accompanied by a certified copy of 
the articles of incorporation or other document(s) necessary to prove 
the transfer of ownership. The manufacturer shall retain a copy of the 
notice with the related formulas.
    (b) Adoption of manufacturer's own formulas from a different 
location. A manufacturer's own formulas may be adopted for use at 
another of the manufacturer's plants. Further, a wholly owned subsidiary 
may adopt the formulas of the parent company, and vice versa. A 
letterhead notice must be filed with the appropriate TTB officer and be 
accompanied by two photocopies of each formula to be adopted. The notice 
shall list the numbers of all formulas to be adopted and shall indicate 
the plant where each was originally approved and the plant(s) where each 
is to be adopted. Some evidence of the relationship between the plants 
involved in the adoption shall be attached to the notice. The notice 
shall be referenced in Part IV of the supporting data (TTB Form 5154.2) 
filed with the first claim relating to the adopted formula(s).

66 FR 5471, Jan. 19, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 17.126  Formulas for intermediate products.

    (a) The manufacturer shall submit a formula on TTB Form 5154.1 for 
each self-manufactured ingredient made with taxpaid spirits and intended 
for the manufacturer's own use in nonbeverage products, unless the 
formula for any such ingredient is fully expressed as part of the 
approved formula for each nonbeverage product in which that ingredient 
is used, or unless the formula for the ingredient is contained in one of 
the pharmaceutical publications listed in Sec. 17.132.
    (b) Upon receipt of Form 5154.1 covering a self-manufactured 
ingredient made with taxpaid spirits, the formula shall be examined 
under Sec. 17.131. If the formula is approved for drawback, the 
ingredient shall be treated as a finished nonbeverage product for 
purposes of this part, rather than as an intermediate product, 
notwithstanding its use by the manufacturer. (For example,

[[Page 346]]

see Sec. 17.152(d).) If the formula is disapproved for drawback, the 
ingredient may be treated as an intermediate product in accordance with 
this part. Requirements pertaining to intermediate products are found in 
Sec. 17.185(b).
    (c) If there is a change in the composition of an intermediate 
product, the manufacturer shall submit an amended or revised formula, as 
provided in Sec. 17.122.


<R05>
Sec. 17.127  Self-manufactured ingredients treated optionally as 
unfinished nonbeverage products.

    A self-manufactured ingredient made with taxpaid spirits, which 
otherwise would be treated as an intermediate product, may instead be 
treated as an unfinished nonbeverage product, if the ingredient's 
formula is fully expressed as a part of the approved formula for the 
nonbeverage product in which the ingredient will be used. A manufacturer 
desiring to change the treatment of an ingredient from ``intermediate 
product'' to ``unfinished nonbeverage product'' (or vice versa) may do 
so by resubmitting the applicable formula(s) on TTB Form 5154.1. 
Requirements pertaining to unfinished nonbeverage products are found in 
Sec. 17.185(c).

                          Approval of Formulas


<R05>
Sec. 17.131  Formulas on TTB Form 5154.1.

    Upon receipt, formulas on TTB Form 5154.1 shall be examined and, if 
found to be medicines, medicinal preparations, food products, flavors, 
flavoring extracts, or perfume which are unfit for beverage purposes and 
which otherwise meet the requirements of law and this part, they shall 
be approved for drawback. If the formulas do not meet the requirements 
of the law and regulations for drawback products, they shall be 
disapproved.


<R05>
Sec. 17.132  U.S.P., N.F., and H.P.U.S. preparations.

    (a) General. Except as otherwise provided by paragraph (b) of this 
section or by TTB ruling, formulas for compounds in which alcohol is a 
prescribed quantitative ingredient, which are stated in the current 
revisions or editions of the United States Pharmacopoeia (U.S.P.), the 
National Formulary (N.F.), or the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the 
United States (H.P.U.S.), shall be considered as approved formulas and 
may be used as formulas for drawback products without the filing of TTB 
Form 5154.1.
    (b) Exceptions. Alcohol (including dehydrated alcohol and dehydrated 
alcohol injection), U.S.P.; alcohol and dextrose injection, U.S.P.; and 
tincture of ginger, H.P.U.S., have been found to be fit for beverage use 
and are disapproved for drawback. All attenuations of other H.P.U.S. 
products diluted beyond one part in 10,000 (``4x'') are also disapproved 
for drawback, unless the manufacturer receives approval for a formula 
submitted on Form 5154.1 in accordance with this subpart. The formula 
for such attenuations shall be submitted with a sample of the product 
and a statement explaining why it should be classified as unfit for 
beverage use.


<R05>
Sec. 17.133  Food product formulas.

    Formulas for nonbeverage food products on TTB Form 5154.1 may be 
approved if they are unfit for beverage purposes. Approval does not 
authorize manufacture or sale contrary to State law. Examples of food 
products that have been found to be unfit for beverage purposes are 
stated below:
    (a) Sauces or syrups. Sauces, or syrups consisting of sugar 
solutions and distilled spirits, in which the alcohol content is not 
more than 12 percent by volume and the sugar content is not less than 60 
grams per 100 cubic centimeters.
    (b) Brandied fruits. Brandied fruits consisting of solidly packaged 
fruits, either whole or segmented, and distilled spirits products not 
exceeding the quantity and alcohol content necessary for flavoring and 
preserving. Generally, brandied fruits will be considered to have met 
these standards if the container is well filled, the alcohol in the 
liquid portion does not exceed 23 percent by volume, and the liquid 
portion does not exceed 45 percent of the volume of the container.
    (c) Candies. Candies with alcoholic fillings, if the fillings meet 
the standards prescribed for sauces and syrups by paragraph (a) of this 
section.

[[Page 347]]

    (d) Other food products. Food products such as mincemeat, plum 
pudding, and fruit cake, where only sufficient distilled spirits are 
used for flavoring and preserving; and ice cream and ices where only 
sufficient spirits are used for flavoring purposes. Also food adjuncts, 
such as preservatives, emulsifying agents, and food colorings, that are 
unfit for beverage purposes and are manufactured and used, or sold for 
use, in food.


<R05>
Sec. 17.134  Determination of unfitness for beverage purposes.

    The appropriate TTB officer has responsibility for determining 
whether products are fit or unfit for beverage purposes within the 
meaning of 26 U.S.C. 5111. This determination may be based either on the 
content and description of the ingredients as shown on TTB Form 5154.1, 
or on organoleptic examination. In such examination, samples of products 
may be diluted with water to an alcoholic concentration of 15% and 
tasted. Sale or use for beverage purposes is indicative of fitness for 
beverage use.

<R05>
Sec. 17.135  Use of specially denatured alcohol (S.D.A.).

    (a) Use of S.D.A. in nonbeverage or intermediate products--(1) 
General. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the use of 
specially denatured alcohol (S.D.A.) and taxpaid spirits in the same 
product by a nonbeverage manufacturer is prohibited where drawback of 
tax is claimed.
    (2) Alternative formulations. No formula for a product on TTB Form 
5154.1 shall be approved for drawback under this subpart if the 
manufacturer also has on file an approved TTB Form 1479-A or Form 
5150.19, Formula for Article Made With Specially Denatured Alcohol or 
Rum, pertaining to the same product.
    (b) Use of S.D.A. in ingredients--(1) Purchased ingredients. 
Generally, purchased ingredients containing S.D.A. may be used in 
nonbeverage or intermediate products. However, such ingredients shall 
not be used in medicinal preparations or flavoring extracts intended for 
internal human use, where any of the S.D.A. remains in the finished 
product.
    (2) Self-manufactured ingredients. Self-manufactured ingredients may 
be made with S.D.A. and used in nonbeverage or intermediate products, 
provided--
    (i) No taxpaid spirits are used in manufacturing such ingredients; 
and
    (ii) All S.D.A. is recovered or dissipated from such ingredients 
prior to their use in nonbeverage or intermediate products. (Recovery of 
S.D.A. shall be in accordance with subpart K of part 20 of this chapter; 
recovered S.D.A., with or without its original denaturants, shall not be 
reused in nonbeverage or intermediate products.)

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1372, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5273))


<R05>
Sec. 17.136  Compliance with Food and Drug Administration requirements.

    A product is not a medicine, medicinal preparation, food product, 
flavor, flavoring extract, or perfume for nonbeverage drawback if its 
formula would violate a ban or restriction of the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) pertaining to such products. If FDA bans or 
restricts the use of any ingredient in such a way that further 
manufacture of a product in accordance with its formula would violate 
the ban or restriction, then the manufacturer shall change the formula 
and resubmit it on TTB Form 5154.1 . This section does not preclude 
approval for products manufactured solely for export or for uses other 
than internal human consumption (e.g. tobacco flavors or animal feed 
flavors) in accordance with laws and regulations administered by FDA. 
Under Sec. 17.123, manufacturers may be required to demonstrate 
compliance with FDA requirements applicable to this section.


<R05>
Sec. 17.137  Formulas disapproved for drawback.

    A formula may be disapproved for drawback either because it does not 
prescribe appropriate ingredients in sufficient quantities to make the 
product unfit for beverage use, or because the product is neither a 
medicine, a medicinal preparation, a food product, a flavor, a flavoring 
extract, nor a perfume. The formula for a disapproved

[[Page 348]]

product may be used as an intermediate product formula under Sec. 
17.126. No drawback will be allowed on distilled spirits used in a 
disapproved product, unless that product is later used in the 
manufacture of an approved nonbeverage product. In the case of a product 
that is disapproved because it is fit for beverage use, any further use 
or disposition of such a product, other than as an intermediate product 
in accordance with this part, subjects the manufacturer to the 
qualification requirements of parts 1 and 19 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 17.141  Drawback.

    Upon the filing of a claim as provided in this subpart, drawback 
shall be allowed to any person who meets the requirements of this part. 
Drawback shall be paid at the rate specified by 26 U.S.C. 5114 on each 
proof gallon of distilled spirits on which the tax has been paid or 
determined and which have been used in the manufacture of nonbeverage 
products. The drawback rate is $1.00 less than the effective tax rate. 
Drawback shall be allowed only to the extent that the claimant can 
establish, by evidence satisfactory to the appropriate TTB officer, the 
actual quantity of taxpaid or tax-determined distilled spirits used in 
the manufacture of the product, and the effective tax rate applicable to 
those spirits.

<R05>
Sec. 17.142  Claims.

    (a) General. The manufacturer must file claim for drawback with the 
appropriate TTB officer who has the authority to approve or disapprove 
claims. A separate claim shall be filed for each place of business. Each 
claim shall pertain only to distilled spirits used in the manufacture or 
production of nonbeverage products during any one quarter of the tax 
year. Unless the manufacturer is eligible to file monthly claims (see 
Sec. Sec. 17.143 and 17.144), only one claim per quarter may be filed 
for each place of business. Claims shall be filed on TTB Form 2635 
(5620.8), Claim--Alcohol and Tobacco Taxes.
    (b) Manufacturers who are also proprietors of distilled spirits 
plants. If a manufacturer of nonbeverage products is owned and operated 
by the same business entity that owns and operates a distilled spirits 
plant, the manufacturer's claim for drawback may be filed for credit on 
Form 2635 (5620.8). After the claim is approved, the distilled spirits 
plant may use the claim as an adjustment decreasing the taxes due in 
Schedule B of TTB Form 5000.24, Excise Tax Return. Adjustments resulting 
from an approved drawback claim are not subject to interest. This 
procedure may be utilized only if the manufacturer of nonbeverage 
products and the distilled spirits plant have the same employer 
identification number.

<R05>
Sec. 17.143  Notice for monthly claims.

    If the manufacturer has notified the appropriate TTB officer, in 
writing, of an intention to file claims on a monthly basis instead of a 
quarterly basis, and has filed a bond in compliance with the provisions 
of this part, claims may be filed monthly instead of quarterly. The 
election to file monthly claims shall not preclude a manufacturer from 
filing a single claim covering an entire quarter, or a single claim 
covering just two months of a quarter, or two claims (one of them 
covering one month and the other covering two months). An election for 
the filing of monthly claims may be withdrawn by the manufacturer by 
filing a notice to that effect, in writing, with the appropriate TTB 
officer.


<R05>
Sec. 17.144  Bond for monthly claims.

    Each person intending to file claims for drawback on a monthly basis 
shall file an executed bond on TTB Form 5154.3, conforming to the 
provisions of subpart E of this part. A monthly drawback claim shall not 
be allowed until bond coverage in a sufficient amount has been approved 
by the appropriate TTB officer. When the limit of liability under a bond 
given in less

[[Page 349]]

than the maximum amount has been reached, further drawback on monthly 
claims may be suspended until a strengthening or superseding bond in a 
sufficient amount is furnished.


<R05>
Sec. 17.145  Date of filing claim.

    Quarterly claims for drawback shall be filed within six months after 
the quarter in which the distilled spirits covered by the claim were 
used in the manufacture of nonbeverage products. Monthly claims for 
drawback may be filed at any time after the end of the month in which 
the distilled spirits covered by the claim were used in the manufacture 
of nonbeverage products, but shall be filed not later than the close of 
the sixth month succeeding the quarter in which the spirits were used.


<R05>
Sec. 17.146  Information to be shown by the claim.

    The claim shall show the following:
    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) That the distilled spirits on which drawback is claimed were 
fully taxpaid or tax-determined at the effective tax rate applicable to 
the distilled spirits.
    (c) That the distilled spirits on which the drawback is claimed were 
used in the manufacture of nonbeverage products.
    (d) Whether the nonbeverage products were manufactured in compliance 
with quantitative formulas approved under subpart F of this part. (If

<R05>
Sec. 17.147  Supporting data.

    (a) Each claim for drawback shall be accompanied by supporting data 
presented according to the format shown on TTB Form 5154.2, Supporting 
Data for Nonbeverage Drawback Claims (or according to any other suitable 
format which provides the same information). Modifications of Form 
5154.2 may be used without prior authorization, if the modified format 
clearly shows all of the required information that is pertinent to the 
manufacturing operation. Under Sec. 17.123, the appropriate TTB officer 
may require additional supporting data when needed to determine the 
correctness of drawback claims.
    (b) Separate data shall be shown for eligible distilled spirits 
taxpaid at different effective tax rates. This requirement applies to 
all eligible spirits, including eligible recovered alcohol and eligible 
spirits contained in intermediate products.
    (c) Separate data shall be shown for imported rum, spirits from 
Puerto Rico containing at least 92% rum, and spirits from the U.S. 
Virgin Islands containing at least 92% rum. The total number of proof 
gallons of each such category used subject to drawback during the claim 
period shall also be shown, with separate totals for each effective tax 
rate. These amounts shall include eligible spirits and rum from 
intermediate products or recovered alcohol.
    (d) Any gain in eligible distilled spirits reported in the 
supporting data shall be reflected by an equivalent deduction from the 
amount of drawback claimed. Gains shall not be offset by known losses.


<R05>
Sec. 17.148  Allowance of claims.

    (a) General. Except in the case of fraudulent noncompliance, no 
claim for drawback shall be denied for a failure to comply with either 
26 U.S.C. 5111-5114 or the requirements of this part, if the claimant 
establishes that spirits on which the tax has been paid or determined 
were in fact used in the manufacture of medicines, medicinal 
preparations, food products, flavors, flavoring extracts, or perfume, 
which were unfit for beverage purposes.
    (b) Penalty. Noncompliance with the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 5111-
5114 or of this part subjects the claimant to a civil penalty of $1,000 
for each separate product, reflected in a claim for drawback, to which 
the noncompliance relates, or the amount claimed for that product, 
whichever is less, unless the claimant establishes that the 
noncompliance was due to reasonable cause. Late filing of a claim 
subjects the claimant to a civil penalty of $1,000 or the amount of the 
claim, whichever is less, unless the claimant establishes that the 
lateness was due to reasonable cause.

[[Page 350]]

    (c) Reasonable cause. Reasonable cause exists where a claimant 
establishes it exercised ordinary business care and prudence, and still 
was unable to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Ignorance of law or regulations, in and of itself, is not reasonable 
cause. Each case is individually evaluated.

                       Spirits Subject to Drawback


<R05>
Sec. 17.151  Use of distilled spirits.

    Distilled spirits are considered to have been used in the 
manufacture of a product under this part if the spirits are consumed in 
the manufacture, are incorporated into the product, or are determined by 
TTB to have been otherwise utilized as an essential part of the 
manufacturing process. However, spirits lost by causes such as spillage, 
leakage, breakage or theft, and spirits used for purposes such as 
rinsing or cleaning a system, are not considered to have been used in 
the manufacture of a product.


<R05>
Sec. 17.152  Time of use of spirits.

    (a) General. Distilled spirits shall be considered used in the 
manufacture of a product as soon as that product contains all the 
ingredients called for by its formula.
    (b) Spirits used in an ion exchange column. Distilled spirits used 
in recharging an ion exchange column, the operation of which is 
essential to the production of a product, shall be considered to be used 
when the spirits are entered into the manufacturing system in accordance 
with the product's formula.
    (c) Products requiring additional processing or treatment. Further 
manipulation of a product, such as aging or filtering, subsequent to the 
mixing together of all of its ingredients, shall not postpone the time 
when spirits are considered used, as determined under paragraph (a) of 
this section. This is true even if at the time of use there has not yet 
been a final determination of alcoholic content by assay. If, however, 
it is later found necessary to add more distilled spirits to standardize 
the product, such added spirits shall be considered as used in the 
period during which they were added.
    (d) Nonbeverage products used to manufacture other products. 
Nonbeverage products may be used to manufacture other nonbeverage (or 
intermediate) products. However, such subsequent usage of a nonbeverage 
product shall not affect the time when the distilled spirits contained 
therein are considered used. When distilled spirits are used in the 
manufacture of a nonbeverage product, the time of use shall be the point 
at which that product first contains all of its prescribed ingredients, 
and such use shall not be determined by the time of any subsequent usage 
of that product in another product.


<R05>
Sec. 17.153  Recovered spirits.

    (a) Recovery from intermediate products. Eligible spirits recovered 
in the manufacture of intermediate products are not subject to drawback 
until such recovered spirits are used in the manufacture of a 
nonbeverage product. (However, see Sec. 17.127 with respect to optional 
treatment of ingredients as unfinished nonbeverage products, rather than 
as intermediate products.) Spirits recovered in the manufacture of 
intermediate products shall be reused only in the manufacture of 
intermediate or nonbeverage products.
    (b) Recovery from nonbeverage products. Distilled spirits recovered 
in the manufacture of a nonbeverage product are considered as having 
been used in the manufacture of that product. If the spirits were 
eligible when so used, they became subject to drawback at that time. 
Upon recovery, such spirits may be reused in the manufacture of 
nonbeverage products, but shall not be reused for any other purpose. 
When reused, such recovered spirits are not again eligible for drawback 
and shall not be used in the manufacture of intermediate products.
    (c) Cross references. For additional provisions respecting the 
recovery of distilled spirits and related recordkeeping requirements, 
see Sec. Sec. 17.168 and 17.183.

[[Page 351]]


<R05>
Sec. 17.154  Spirits contained in intermediate products.

    Spirits contained in an intermediate product are not subject to 
drawback until that intermediate product is used in the manufacture of a 
nonbeverage product.


<R05>
Sec. 17.155  Spirits consumed in manufacturing intermediate products.

    Spirits consumed in the manufacture of an intermediate product--
which are not contained in the intermediate product at the time of its 
use in nonbeverage products--are not subject to drawback. Such spirits 
are not considered to have been used in the manufacture of nonbeverage 
products. However, see Sec. 17.127 with respect to optional treatment 
of ingredients as unfinished nonbeverage products, rather than as 
intermediate products.

                            Subpart H_Records


<R05>
Sec. 17.161  General.

    Each person claiming drawback on taxpaid distilled spirits used in 
the manufacture of nonbeverage products shall maintain records showing 
the information required in this subpart. No particular form is 
prescribed for these records, but the data required to be shown shall be 
clearly recorded and organized to enable appropriate TTB officers to 
trace each operation or transaction, monitor compliance with law and 
regulations, and verify the accuracy of each claim. Ordinary business 
records, including invoices and cost accounting records, are acceptable 
if they show the required information or are annotated to show any such 
information that is lacking. The records shall be kept complete and 
current at all times and shall be retained by the manufacturer at the 
place where the taxpaid distilled spirits are used in the manufacture or 
production of nonbeverage products, for the period prescribed in Sec. 
17.170.

<R05>
Sec. 17.162  Receipt of distilled spirits.

    (a) Distilled spirits received in tank cars, tank trucks, barrels, 
or drums. For distilled spirits received in tank cars, tank trucks, 
barrels, or drums, the manufacturer shall record, with respect to each 
shipment received--
    (1) The date of receipt;
    (2) The name and address of the person from whom received;
    (3) The serial number or other identification mark (if any) of each 
tank car, tank truck, barrel, or drum;
    (4) The name of the producer or warehouseman who paid or determined 
the tax;
    (5) The effective tax rate (if other than the rate prescribed by 26 
U.S.C. 5001); and
    (6) The kind, quantity, and proof (or alcohol percentage by volume) 
of the spirits.
    (b) Distilled spirits received in bottles. For distilled spirits 
received in bottles, the manufacturer shall record--
    (1) The date of receipt;
    (2) The name and address of the seller;
    (3) The serial number of each case, if the bottles are received in 
cases;
    (4) The name of the bottler;
    (5) The effective tax rate (if other than the rate prescribed by 26 
U.S.C. 5001); and
    (6) The kind, quantity, and proof (or alcohol percentage by volume) 
of the spirits.
    (c) Distilled spirits received by pipeline. For distilled spirits 
received by pipeline, the manufacturer shall record--
    (1) The date of receipt;
    (2) The name of the producer or warehouseman who paid or determined 
the tax;
    (3) The effective tax rate (if other than the rate prescribed by 26 
U.S.C. 5001); and
    (4) The kind, quantity, and proof (or alcohol percentage by volume) 
of the spirits.
    (d) Determination of quantity. At the time of receipt, each 
manufacturer shall determine (preferably by weight) and record the exact 
number of proof gallons of distilled spirits received. The amount 
received in bottles may be determined by the required statements on the 
labels. The amount received in sealed drums with no evidence of leakage 
may be determined from the record of shipment, which is required by 
Sec. 19.626 of this chapter to accompany

[[Page 352]]

spirits received from a distilled spirits plant. If spirits are received 
in a tank car or tank truck, and the result of the manufacturer's gauge 
of the spirits is within 0.2 percent of the number of proof gallons 
reported on the record of shipment required by Sec. 19.626, then the 
number of proof gallons reported on that record may be recorded as the 
quantity received. Nevertheless, the receiving gauge shall be noted on 
the record of receipt. If, for any shipment, the amount recorded in the 
manufacturer's records as the quantity received is greater than the 
amount shown as taxpaid on the record required by Sec. 19.626, a 
deduction equivalent to the excess shall be made from the amount of 
drawback claimed in the manufacturer's claim covering that period. If no 
claim is filed for that period, then the deduction shall be made in the 
manufacturer's next claim. Losses in transit that exceed the 0.2 percent 
limitation provided in this paragraph shall be determined and noted on 
the record of receipt. Such losses shall not be recorded as distilled 
spirits received.
    (e) Receipt of imported rum, or spirits from Puerto Rico or the 
Virgin Islands. If spirits are received which contain at least 92% rum, 
and which originate from Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands, the 
record of receipt shall indicate the place of origin. If rum is 
received, the record shall indicate whether it is from Puerto Rico, from 
the U.S. Virgin Islands, imported from other countries, or domestic.
    (f) Shipments from distilled spirits plants. If spirits are received 
directly from the distilled spirits plant that paid or determined the 
tax, the manufacturer shall retain the record of shipment required by 
Sec. 19.626 of this chapter. To the extent that the information on that 
record duplicates the requirements of this section, retention of that 
record shall satisfy those requirements. If there are differences 
between the information on the record of shipment and the information 
required to be recorded by this section, the requirements of this 
section may be met by appropriate annotations on the record of shipment.

FR 9090, Feb. 16, 2011]


<R05>
Sec. 17.163  Evidence of taxpayment of distilled spirits.

    (a) Shipments from distilled spirits plants. For each shipment of 
taxpaid spirits from the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant, 
the manufacturer shall obtain the record of shipment prepared by the 
supplier under Sec. 19.626 of this chapter. This record shall be 
retained with the commercial invoice (if the latter is a separate 
document) as evidence of taxpayment of the spirits. The record shall 
show the effective tax rate(s) (if other than the rate prescribed by 26 
U.S.C. 5001) applicable to the shipment.
    (b) Purchases from wholesale and retail liquor dealers. 
Manufacturers shall obtain commercial invoices or other documentation 
pertaining to purchases of distilled spirits from wholesale and retail 
liquor dealers (including such dealership operations when conducted in 
conjunction with a distilled spirits plant). For spirits other than 
alcohol, grain spirits, neutral spirits, distilled gin, or straight 
whisky (as defined in the standards of identity prescribed by Sec. 5.22 
of this chapter), the manufacturer of nonbeverage products shall obtain 
evidence, from the producer or bottler of the spirits, as to the 
effective tax rate paid thereon.
    (c) Imported spirits. For imported spirits that were taxpaid through 
Customs, evidence of such taxpayment (such as Customs Forms 7501 and 
7505, receipted to indicate payment of tax, and the certificate of 
effective tax rate computation, if applicable) shall be secured from the 
importer and retained by the manufacturer.
    (d) Evidence of effective tax rate. If the evidence of effective tax 
rate, required by this section for distilled spirits products that may 
contain wine or flavors, is not obtained, drawback shall only be allowed 
based on the lowest effective tax rate possible for the kind of 
distilled spirits product used.

[T.D. ATF-379, 61 FR 31412, June 20, 1996, as amended by T.D. TTB-92, 76 
FR 9090, Feb. 16, 2011]


<R05>
Sec. 17.164  Production record.

    (a) General. Each manufacturer shall keep a production record for 
each batch of intermediate product and for each batch of nonbeverage 
product.

[[Page 353]]

The production record shall be an original record made at the time of 
production by a person (or persons) having actual knowledge thereof. If 
any product is produced by a continuous process rather than by batches, 
the production record shall pertain to the total quantity of that 
product produced during each claim period.
    (b) Information to be shown. The record shall show the name and 
formula number of the product, the actual quantities of all ingredients 
used in the manufacture of the batch (including the proof or alcohol 
percentage by volume of all spirits), the date when eligible spirits 
were considered used (see Sec. 17.152), the effective tax rate 
applicable to those spirits (if other than the rate prescribed by 26 
U.S.C. 5001), and the quantity of product produced. The alcohol content 
of the product shall be shown if a test of alcohol content was made (see 
paragraph (e) of this section). Usage of eligible and ineligible spirits 
shall be shown separately. If spirits from Puerto Rico or the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, containing at least 92% rum, were used, the record shall 
indicate their place of origin. If rum was used, the record shall 
indicate whether it was from Puerto Rico, from the U.S. Virgin Islands, 
imported from other countries, or domestic. If spirits were recovered, 
the production record shall so indicate, and the record required by 
Sec. 17.168 shall be kept. If drawback is claimed on spirits consumed 
as an essential part of the manufacture of a nonbeverage product, which 
were not contained in that product at its completion, then the 
production record shall show the quantity of spirits so consumed in the 
manufacture of each batch.
    (c) Specificity of information. The production record shall refer to 
ingredients by the same names as are used for them in the product's 
formula. This includes formulas submitted to TTB and formulas contained 
in the publications listed in Sec. 17.132. Other names for the 
ingredients may be added in the production record, if necessary for the 
manufacturer's operations. Usage of ingredients (including spirits) may 
be shown in units of weight or volume.
    (d) Determining quantity of distilled spirits used. Each 
manufacturer shall accurately determine, by weight or volume, and record 
in the production records the quantity of all distilled spirits used. 
When the quantity used is determined by volume, adjustments shall be 
made if the temperature of the spirits is above or below 60 degrees 
Fahrenheit. A table for correction of volume of spirituous liquors to 60 
degrees Fahrenheit, Table 7 of the ``Gauging Manual,'' is available. See 
subpart E of part 30 of this chapter and Sec. 30.67. Losses after 
receipt due to leakage, spillage, evaporation, or other causes not 
essential to the manufacturing process shall be accurately recorded in 
the manufacturer's permanent records at the time such losses are 
determined.
    (e) Tests of alcohol content. At representative intervals, the 
manufacturer shall verify the alcohol content of nonbeverage products. 
The results of such tests shall be recorded.


<R05>
Sec. 17.165  Receipt of raw ingredients.

    For raw ingredients destined to be used in nonbeverage or 
intermediate products, the manufacturer shall record, for each shipment 
received--
    (a) The date of receipt;
    (b) The quantity received; and
    (c) The identity of the supplier.


<R05>
Sec. 17.166  Disposition of nonbeverage products.

    (a) Shipments. For each shipment of nonbeverage products, the 
manufacturer shall record--
    (1) The formula number of the product;
    (2) The date of shipment;
    (3) The quantity shipped; and
    (4) The identity of the consignee.
    (b) Other disposition. For other dispositions of nonbeverage 
products, the manufacturer shall record--
    (1) The type of disposition;
    (2) The date of disposition; and
    (3) The quantity of each product so disposed of.
    (c) Exception. The manufacturer need not keep the records required 
by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for any nonbeverage product 
which either contains less than 3 percent of distilled spirits by 
volume, or is sold by the producer directly to the consumer in retail 
quantities. However, when needed

[[Page 354]]

for protection of the revenue, the appropriate TTB officer may at any 
time require the keeping of these records upon giving at least five 
days' notice to the manufacturer.


<R05>
Sec. 17.167  Inventories.

    (a) Distilled spirits. The ``on hand'' figures reported in Part II 
of TTB Form 5154.2 shall be verified by physical inventories taken as of 
the end of each quarter in which nonbeverage products were manufactured 
for purposes of drawback. Spirits taxpaid at different effective tax 
rates shall be inventoried separately. The inventory record shall show 
the date inventory was taken, the person(s) by whom it was taken, 
subtotals for each product inventoried, and any gains or losses 
disclosed; and shall be retained with the manufacturer's records. The 
manufacturer shall explain in Part IV of the supporting data (Form 
5154.2) any discrepancy between the amounts on hand as disclosed by 
physical inventory and the amounts indicated by the manufacturer's 
records. Any gain in eligible spirits disclosed by inventory requires an 
equivalent deduction from the claim with which the inventory is 
reported. Gains shall not be offset by known losses. If no claim is 
filed for a quarter (nor for any monthly period therein), then no 
physical inventory is required for that quarter.
    (b) Raw ingredients and nonbeverage products. When necessary for 
ensuring compliance with regulations and protection of the revenue, the 
appropriate TTB officer may require a manufacturer to take physical 
inventories of finished nonbeverage products, and/or raw ingredients 
intended for use in the manufacture of nonbeverage or intermediate 
products. The results of such inventories shall be recorded in the 
manufacturer's records. Any discrepancy between the amounts on hand as 
disclosed by physical inventory and such amounts as indicated by the 
manufacturer's records shall also be recorded with an explanation of its 
cause.


<R05>
Sec. 17.168  Recovered spirits.

    (a) Each manufacturer intending to recover distilled spirits under 
the provisions of this part shall first notify the appropriate TTB 
officer. Any apparatus used to separate alcohol is subject to the 
registration requirements of 26 U.S.C. 5179 and subpart C of part 29 of 
this chapter. Recovery operations may only be conducted on the premises 
where the recovered spirits were used in the manufacture or production 
of nonbeverage or intermediate products.
    (b) The manufacturer shall keep a record of the distilled spirits 
recovered and the subsequent use to which such spirits are put. The 
record shall show--
    (1) The date of recovery;
    (2) The commodity or process from which the spirits were recovered;
    (3) The amount in proof gallons, or by weight and proof (or alcohol 
percentage by volume) of distilled spirits recovered;
    (4) The amount in proof gallons, or by weight and proof (or alcohol 
percentage by volume) of recovered distilled spirits reused;
    (5) The commodity in which the recovered distilled spirits were 
reused; and
    (6) The date of reuse.
    (c) Whenever recovered spirits are destroyed (see Sec. 17.183), the 
record shall further show--
    (1) The reason for the destruction;
    (2) The date, time, location, and manner of destruction;
    (3) The number of proof gallons destroyed; and
    (4) The name of the individual who accomplished or supervised the 
destruction.

Sec. 17.169  Transfer of intermediate products.

    When intermediate products are transferred as permitted by Sec. 
17.185(b), supporting records of such transfers shall be kept at the 
shipping and receiving plants, showing the date and quantity of each 
product transferred.


<R05>
Sec. 17.170  Retention of records.

    Each manufacturer shall retain for a period of not less than 3 years 
all records required by this part, a copy of all claims and supporting 
data filed in

[[Page 355]]

support thereof, all commercial invoices or other documents evidencing 
taxpayment or tax-determination of domestic spirits, all documents 
evidencing taxpayment of imported spirits, and all bills of lading 
received which pertain to shipments of spirits. In addition, a copy of 
each formula submitted on TTB Form 5154.1 shall be retained at each 
factory where the formula is used, for not less than 3 years from the 
date of filing of the last claim for drawback under the formula. A copy 
of an approval to use an alternate method or procedure shall be retained 
as long as the manufacturer employs the method or procedure, and for 3 
years thereafter. Further, the appropriate TTB officer may require these 
records, forms, and documents to be retained for an additional period of 
not more than 3 years in any case where he or she deems such retention 
to be necessary or advisable for protection of the revenue.


<R05>
Sec. 17.171  Inspection of records.

    All of the records, forms, and documents required to be retained by 
Sec. 17.170 shall be kept at the premises where distilled spirits are 
used in the manufacture or production of nonbeverage products and shall 
be readily available during the manufacturer's regular business hours 
for examination and copying by the appropriate TTB officers. At the same 
time, any other books, papers, records or memoranda in the possession of 
the manufacturer, which have a bearing upon the matters required to be 
alleged in a claim for drawback, shall be available for inspection by 
appropriate TTB officers.

Sec. 17.181  Exportation of medicinal preparations and flavoring extracts.

    Medicinal preparations and flavoring extracts, approved for drawback 
under the provisions of this part, may be exported subject to 19 U.S.C. 
1313(d), which authorizes export drawback equal to the entire amount of 
internal revenue tax found to have been paid on the domestic alcohol 
used in the manufacture of such products. (Note: Export drawback is not 
allowed for imported alcohol under this provision of customs law.) 
Claims for such export drawback shall be filed in accordance with the 
applicable regulations of the U.S. Customs Service. Such claims may 
cover either the full rate of tax which has been paid on the alcohol, if 
no nonbeverage drawback has been claimed thereon, or else the remainder 
of the tax if nonbeverage drawback under 26 U.S.C. 5114 has been or will 
be claimed.

Sec. 17.182  Drawback claims by druggists.

    Drawback of tax under 26 U.S.C. 5114 is allowable on taxpaid 
distilled spirits used by druggists in compounding prescriptions. The 
prescriptions so compounded shall be shown in the supporting data by 
listing the first and last serial numbers thereof. The amount of taxpaid 
spirits used in each prescription need not be shown, but such 
prescriptions shall be made available for examination by appropriate TTB 
officers. If refills have been made of prescriptions received in a 
previous claim period, their serial numbers shall be recorded 
separately. Druggists claiming drawback as authorized by this section 
are subject to all the applicable requirements of this part, except 
those requiring the filing of quantitative formulas.

<R05>
Sec. 17.183  Disposition of recovered alcohol and material from which
alcohol can be recovered.

    (a) Recovered alcohol. Manufacturers of nonbeverage products shall 
not sell or transfer recovered spirits to any other premises without TTB 
authorization under Sec. 17.3. If recovered spirits are stored pending 
reuse, storage facilities shall be adequate to protect the revenue. If 
recovered spirits are destroyed, the record required by Sec. 17.168(c) 
must be kept. Spirits recovered from intermediate products may be 
destroyed

[[Page 356]]

without notice to TTB. Spirits recovered from nonbeverage products may 
be destroyed pursuant to a notice filed with the appropriate TTB officer 
at least 12 days prior to the date of destruction. The notice shall 
state the reason for the destruction, the intended date of destruction, 
and the approximate quantity involved. The appropriate TTB officer may 
impose specific conditions, including requiring that the destruction be 
witnessed by an appropriate TTB. Unless the manufacturer is otherwise 
advised by the appropriate TTB officer before the date specified in the 
notice, the destruction may proceed as planned.
    (b) By-product material (general). By-product material from which 
alcohol can be recovered shall not be sold or transferred unless the 
alcohol has been removed or an approved substance has been added to 
prevent recovery of residual alcohol. Material from which alcohol can be 
recovered may also be destroyed on the manufacturer's premises by a 
suitable method. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, 
prior written approval shall be obtained from the appropriate TTB 
officer as to the adequacy, under this section, of any substance 
proposed to be added to prevent recovery of alcohol, or of any proposed 
method of destruction.
    (c) Spent vanilla beans. Specific approval from the appropriate TTB 
officer is not required when spent vanilla beans containing residual 
alcohol are destroyed on the manufacturer's premises by burning, or when 
they are removed from those premises after treatment with sufficient

prevent recovery of residual alcohol.


<R05>
Sec. 17.184  Distilled spirits container marks.

    All marks required by Part 19 of this chapter shall remain on 
containers of taxpaid distilled spirits until the contents are emptied. 
Whenever such a container is emptied, such marks shall be completely 
obliterated.

(Sec. 454, Pub. L. 98-369, 98 Stat. 820 (26 U.S.C. 5206(d)))


<R05>
Sec. 17.185  Requirements for intermediate products and unfinished 
nonbeverage products.

    (a) General. Self-manufactured ingredients made with taxpaid spirits 
may be accounted for either as intermediate products or as unfinished 
nonbeverage products. The manufacturer may choose either method of 
accounting for such self-manufactured ingredients (see Sec. 17.127). 
However, the method selected determines the requirements that will apply 
to those ingredients, as prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section.
    (b) Intermediate products. Intermediate products shall be used 
exclusively in the manufacture of nonbeverage products. Intermediate 
products may be accumulated and stored indefinitely and may be used in 
any nonbeverage product whose formula calls for such use. Intermediate 
products shall be manufactured by the same entity that manufactures the 
finished nonbeverage products. Intermediate products shall not be sold 
or transferred between separate and distinct entities. However, they may 
be transferred to another branch or plant of the same manufacturer, for 
use there in the manufacture of approved nonbeverage products. (See 
Sec. 17.169 for recordkeeping requirement.) For the purposes of this 
section, the phrase ``separate and distinct entities'' includes parent 
and subsidiary corporations, regardless of any corporate (or other) 
relationship, and even if the stock of both the manufacturing firm and 
the receiving firm is owned by the same persons.
    (c) Unfinished nonbeverage products. An unfinished nonbeverage 
product shall only be used in the particular nonbeverage product for 
which it was manufactured, and shall be entirely so used within the time 
limit stated in the approved TTB Form 5154.1. Spirits dissipated or 
recovered in the manufacture of unfinished nonbeverage products shall be 
regarded as having been dissipated or recovered in the manufacture of 
nonbeverage products. Spirits contained in such unfinished products 
shall be accounted for in the supporting data under Sec. 17.147 and 
inventoried under Sec. 17.167 as ``in process'' in nonbeverage 
products. Production of unfinished nonbeverage products shall

[[Page 357]]

be recorded as an integral part of the production records for the 
related nonbeverage products. Unfinished nonbeverage products shall not 
be transferred to other premises.


<R05>
Sec. 17.186  Transfer of distilled spirits to other containers.

    A manufacturer may transfer taxpaid distilled spirits from the 
original package to other containers at any time for the purpose of 
facilitating the manufacture of products unfit for beverage use. 
Containers into which distilled spirits have been transferred under this 
section shall bear a label identifying their contents as taxpaid 
distilled spirits, and shall be marked with the serial number of the 
original package from which the spirits were withdrawn.


<R05>
Sec. 17.187  Discontinuance of business.

    The manufacturer shall notify TTB when business is to be 
discontinued. Upon discontinuance of business, a manufacturer's entire 
stock of taxpaid distilled spirits on hand may be sold in a single sale 
without the necessity of qualifying as a wholesaler under part 1 of this 
chapter or registering and keeping records as a liquor dealer under part 
31 of this chapter.The spirits likewise may be returned to the person 
from whom purchased, or they may be destroyed or given away.

whether a product is unfit for beverage use, the manufacturer will 
submit the formula and a sample of the product to the appropriate TTB 
officer for examination. TTB will determine whether the product is unfit 
for beverage use and whether manufacture of the product is exempt from 
qualification requirements.

under paragraph (a) of this section is being used for beverage purposes, 
or for mixing with beverage spirits other than by a processor, TTB will 
notify the manufacturer to stop manufacturing the product until the 
formula is changed to make the product unfit for beverage use and the 
change is approved by the appropriate TTB officer. However, the 
provisions of this paragraph will not prohibit products which are unfit 
for beverage use from use in small quantities for flavoring drinks at 
the time of serving for immediate consumption.

Sec. 19.17  Detention of containers.

    (a) General. A TTB officer may detain any container containing, or 
supposed to contain, spirits when the appropriate TTB officer believes 
that the required tax on those spirits has not been paid or determined 
or that the removal of the container is in violation of law or the 
provisions of this part. The appropriate TTB officer will hold the 
container at a safe place until it is determined whether the detained 
property is subject to forfeiture.
    (b) Limitation. A detention under paragraph (a) of this section may 
not exceed 72 hours without process of law or intervention of the 
appropriate TTB officer. However, the detained container may be kept on 
the premises beyond the 72-hour period without process of law or

<R05>
Sec. 19.19  Discontinuance of storage facilities.

    If TTB determines that a proprietor's bonded storage facility for 
spirits is unsafe or unfit for use, or causes excessive waste or loss of 
spirits, TTB can require that the proprietor discontinue using the 
facility. Further, TTB can require the transfer of the spirits stored in 
the facility to another storage facility. The transfer will take place 
at such time and under such supervision as TTB may require, and will be 
at the expense of the owner or warehouseman of the spirits. If the owner 
or warehouseman fails to transfer the spirits within the prescribed time 
or to pay the expense of the transfer, as ascertained and determined by 
the appropriate TTB officer, the spirits may be seized and sold. TTB 
will first apply the proceeds of such sale to the payment of the taxes 
due on the spirits and then to the cost and expense of the sale and 
removal, and the remaining balance, if any, will be paid over to the 
owner or warehouseman.

operating permit by submitting written documentation in accordance with 
this section to the appropriate TTB officer in writing within 30 days of 
the change unless another time period is specified in this subpart.
    (1) TTB F 5110.25. Except when a letterhead application or

letterhead application change is subject to TTB approval. The 
appropriate TTB officer may, at any time, require that the proprietor 
submit an amended application on TTB F 5110.25 if administrative 
difficulties occur as a result of the letterhead application.
    (3) Letterhead notices. For certain changes noted in this subpart 
only a letterhead notice is required. A letterhead notice does not 
require approval by TTB. The appropriate TTB officer may, at any time, 
require that the proprietor submit amended application on TTB F 5110.25

                 Subpart F_Bonds and Consents of Surety

                     Bonding Requirements for a DSP


<R05>
Sec. 19.151  General.

    (a) Bond required. Any person who plans to establish and operate a 
distilled spirits plant must provide TTB with one or more bonds on form 
TTB F 5110.56, Distilled Spirits Bond. TTB will not approve a 
registration or allow a person to operate a distilled spirits plant 
until the applicant has provided the necessary bonds. If a proprietor 
fails to pay any liability covered by a bond, TTB may seek payment from 
the proprietor, from the surety (see Sec. 19.153) or from both the 
proprietor and the surety. The types and penal sums of bonds required 
will depend upon the type and size of the operations that the proprietor 
will conduct.
    (b) Bond terms and conditions. The terms and conditions of a 
distilled spirits bond require that the proprietor comply with all 
provisions of law and regulations relating to activities covered by the 
bond, and to pay all taxes imposed by 26 U.S.C. chapter 51, including 
taxes on unexplained shortages of bottled distilled spirits. The bond 
will further specify that the proprietor will pay all penalties 
incurred, or fines imposed, for violations of law and regulations 
relating to activities covered by the bond. The specific terms of the 
required bond(s) are stated on TTB F 5110.56.

[[Page 403]]

    (c) Corporations and controlled subsidiaries. For purposes of this 
subpart, the term ``corporation'' includes a Limited Liability Company 
(LLC) or Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) in any jurisdiction where 
the law authorizes such a business organization to operate. Whenever 
used in this subpart, the term ``controlled subsidiary'' means a 
corporation (or LLC or LLP) in which more than 50 percent of the voting 
power is controlled by a parent corporation.

(26 U.S.C. 5173, 5551)


<R05>
Sec. 19.152  Types of bonds.

    (a) Basic Bonds. There are two basic types of bonds: the operations 
bond, and the withdrawal bond.
    (1) Operations bond. An operations bond covers the tax liability for 
a variety of operations at a distilled spirits plant, along with any 
penalties incurred and fines imposed for violation of the law and 
regulations relating to activities covered by the bond.
    (2) Withdrawal bond. A withdrawal bond covers the tax liability for 
tax determined distilled spirits withdrawn from the bonded premises on a 
tax deferred basis.
    (b) Other bonds. In addition to the basic operations and withdrawal 
bonds, several variations of these bonds are available:
    (1) An adjacent wine cellar bond covers operations at a distilled 
spirits plant and an adjacent bonded wine cellar;
    (2) An area bond covers operations at two or more distilled spirits 
plant and any adjacent bonded wine cellars; and
    (3) A unit bond covers both operations and withdrawals at one or 
more distilled spirits plants and operations at any adjacent bonded wine 
cellars.

(26 U.S.C. 5173)


<R05>
Sec. 19.153  Bond guaranteed by a corporate surety.

    (a) Corporate surety. A company that issues bonds is called a 
``corporate surety.'' Proprietors must obtain the surety bonds required 
by this subpart from a corporate surety approved by the Secretary of the 
Treasury.
    (b) How to find an approved surety. The Department of the Treasury 
publishes a list of approved corporate surety companies in Treasury 
Department Circular No. 570, ``Companies Holding Certificates of 
Authority as Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds and as Acceptable 
Reinsuring Companies.'' Circular 570 is published annually in the 
Federal Register. The most current edition of the circular is posted at 
the Web site of the Financial Management Service, Department of the 
Treasury at http://www.fms.treas.gov/c570. Printed copies of Circular 
570 are available for purchase from the Government Printing Office.

(31 U.S.C. 9304, 9306)


<R05>
Sec. 19.154  Bond guaranteed by deposit of securities.

    (a) General. As an alternative to the corporate surety bond under 
Sec. 19.153, a person can file a bond that guarantees payment of the 
liability by pledging one or more acceptable negotiable securities. 
These securities must have a par value (face amount) equal to or greater 
than the penal sums of the required bonds. The pledged securities are 
held in the Federal Reserve Bank in a safekeeping account with TTB as 
the pledgee. Should the proprietor fail to pay one or more of the 
guaranteed liabilities, TTB can take action to sell the deposited 
securities to satisfy the debt. Pledged securities will be released if 
there are no outstanding liabilities when the bond is terminated. (See 
Sec. 19.170.)
    (b) Acceptable securities. Only public debt obligations of the 
United States, the principal and interest of which are unconditionally 
guaranteed by the United States Government, are acceptable for the 
purpose described in paragraph (a) of this section. The Department of 
the Treasury and certain other United States Government agencies issue 
debt instruments that are acceptable as collateral, such as Treasury 
notes and Treasury bills. Savings bonds, certificates of deposit and 
letters of credit are not acceptable. A list of securities acceptable as 
collateral in lieu of surety bonds is available from the Bureau of the 
Public Debt, Office of the Commissioner, Government Securities 
Regulations Staff. Current information and guidance from the Bureau

of the Public Debt may be found at http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov.

(31 U.S.C. 9301, 9303; 31 CFR part 380)


<R05>
Sec. 19.155  Change of surety bond terms--consent of surety.

    In order to change the terms of an approved bond, both the principal 
and the surety company that guaranteed the bond must agree to the 
change. TTB must also approve the change. All changes to the terms of a 
bond must be executed on form TTB F 5000.18, Change of Bond (Consent of 
Surety) by both the principal and the surety with the same formality and 
proof of authority as required for the original bond. The completed, 
executed TTB F 5000.18 must be submitted to the National Revenue Center.

(26 U.S.C. 5173)


<R05>
Sec. 19.156  Power of attorney for surety.

    (a) Requirement for power of attorney. Every bond and every consent 
of surety filed with TTB in which an agent or officer executed the bond 
or consent on behalf of the surety must be supported by a power of 
attorney authorizing the agent or officer to execute the bond or consent 
of surety. The power of attorney assures TTB that the person who signed 
the bond on behalf of the surety has the legal authority to obligate the 
surety.
    (b) Form of power of attorney and endorsement. A power of attorney 
will be prepared on the surety's own form, and must be executed under 
the surety's corporate seal. If the power of attorney submitted is other 
than a manually signed original, it must be accompanied by a 
certification from the surety that the power of attorney is valid.
    (c) Additional documentation. The appropriate TTB officer authorized 
to approve and accept the bond may require additional evidence of the 
authenticity of signatures and the authority of persons signing on 
behalf of the surety to execute the bond or consent.

(31 U.S.C. 9304, 9306)


<R05>
Sec. 19.157  Disapproval of bonds and consents of surety.

    (a) Grounds for disapproval. The appropriate TTB officer may 
disapprove any bond or consent of surety required by this part if the 
principal or any person having ownership, control or responsibility for 
actively managing the business of the surety has been previously 
convicted, in a court of competent jurisdiction of:
    (1) Any fraudulent noncompliance with any provision of any law of 
the United States relating to internal revenue or customs taxation of 
spirits, wines, or beer, or if the offense was compromised by payment of 
penalties or otherwise, or
    (2) Any felony under a law of any State or the District of Columbia, 
or the United States, prohibiting the manufacture, sale, importation, or 
transportation of spirits, wine, beer, or other intoxicating liquor.
    (b) Appeal. If the appropriate TTB officer disapproves a bond or 
consent of surety, the person giving the bond may appeal the disapproval 
to the Administrator, who will hear the appeal. The decision of the 
Administrator will be final.

(26 U.S.C. 5551)

            Requirements for Operations and Withdrawal Bonds


<R05>
Sec. 19.161  Operations bond.

    (a) General. Any person who intends to establish a distilled spirits 
plant must furnish an operations bond (or a unit bond, see Sec. 19.165) 
covering distilled spirits operations at such plant on TTB F 5110.56 
with the original application to register the distilled spirits plant.
    (b) Approval of bond. The appropriate TTB officer may require a 
statement, executed under the penalty of perjury, as to whether the 
principal, or any person owning, controlling, or managing the business 
of the applicant has been convicted of, or has compromised any offense 
listed in Sec. 19.157(a)(1), or has been convicted of any offense 
listed in Sec. 19.157(a)(2). If the above statement contains an 
affirmative answer, the applicant must provide an additional detailed 
statement describing the circumstances surrounding each conviction or 
compromise. The appropriate TTB officer will decide whether to approve 
or disapprove the bond.

(26 U.S.C. 5173, 5551)

[[Page 405]]


<R05>
Sec. 19.162  Operations bond for distilled spirits plant and adjacent
bonded wine cellar.

    (a) One bond satisfying two requirements. A proprietor who operates 
a bonded wine cellar that is adjacent to the proprietor's distilled 
spirits plant may file a single operations bond to cover the operations 
of the distilled spirits plant and the bonded wine cellar. A proprietor 
who files this type of bond satisfies the requirement in 26 U.S.C. 5173 
for an operations bond covering the distilled spirits plant and the 
requirement in 26 U.S.C. 5354 for a bond covering wine and spirits 
possessed at, and in transit to, the bonded wine cellar. (The proprietor 
may still have to obtain a supplemental bond for the wine cellar to 
cover liabilities resulting from deferred payment of tax. See the second 
sentence of 26 U.S.C. 5354.)
    (b) One bond combining terms and coverage of separate bonds. An 
operations bond filed under paragraph (a) of this section must contain 
the same terms and conditions that would be in separate bonds for the 
distilled spirits plant and for the bonded wine cellar. The proprietor 
may not allocate or divide the penal sum between the distilled spirits 
plant and the bonded wine cellar. The total amount of the bond must be 
available to satisfy any liability incurred under the terms of the bond 
at either facility.
    (c) Persons qualified for a single bond. A proprietor may choose to 
file a single operations bond for a distilled spirits plant and adjacent 
bonded wine cellar only if:
    (1) Such distilled spirits plant is qualified under subpart D of 
this part for the production of distilled spirits; and
    (2) Such wine cellar and distilled spirits plant are operated by the 
same person (or in the case of a corporation, by such corporation and 
its controlled subsidiaries).

(26 U.S.C. 5173, 5351, 5354)


<R05>
Sec. 19.163  Area operations bond.

    (a) Area operations bond covering multiple locations. A person who 
operates more than one distilled spirits plant within the geographical 
area serviced by the National Revenue Center may submit to TTB an area 
operations bond covering the operations of any two or more such plants 
and any bonded wine cellars that are adjacent to such plants and which 
otherwise could be covered by an operations bond. Area operations bonds 
filed under this section will be in lieu of the operations bond 
requirements for single distilled spirits plants under Sec. Sec. 19.161 
and 19.166 and must contain the same terms and conditions as those 
contained in separate bonds filed for single distilled spirits plants. 
Any person who files an area operations bond may not allocate or divide 
the penal sum of the area operations bond between the separate locations 
and the total penal sum of the bond must be available to satisfy 
liability incurred at any of the covered locations.
    (b) Area operations bonds filed by corporations. An area operations 
bond may only cover distilled spirits plants and adjacent bonded wine 
cellars that are operated by the same person. For purposes of this 
section, a corporation and its controlled subsidiaries are considered to 
be one person. Further, a controlled subsidiary is a corporation in 
which more than 50 percent of the voting power is controlled by the 
parent corporation. Consequently, an area operations bond may cover 
distilled spirits plants and adjacent bonded wine cellars operated by a 
parent corporation and one or more of its controlled subsidiaries. The 
name of each corporation that operates a covered facility must appear on 
the bond as a principal, whether the operating corporation is the parent 
or a subsidiary. The bond must bear an authorized signature for each 
operating corporation appearing on the bond.

(26 U.S.C. 5173)


<R05>
Sec. 19.164  Withdrawal bond.

    (a) Requirement for a withdrawal bond. If a person intends to 
withdraw spirits from a distilled spirits plant upon determination of 
the taxes due on the spirits but before payment of the tax, the person 
must provide TTB with a withdrawal bond for the distilled spirits plant. 
The withdrawal bond must guarantee payment of any taxes due on distilled 
spirits withdrawn from bonded premises up to the amount of the bond.

[[Page 406]]

Such bond will be in addition to the operations bond, and if the 
distilled spirits are withdrawn under the withdrawal bond, the 
operations bond will no longer cover liability for payment of the tax on 
the spirits withdrawn. For purposes of this section, a person includes a 
corporation, together with all of its controlled subsidiaries, and a 
controlled subsidiary has the same meaning as in Sec. 19.163(b).
    (b) One bond covering multiple plants. A person who operates more 
than one distilled spirits plant within the geographical area serviced 
by the National Revenue Center may submit to TTB a single withdrawal 
bond that covers withdrawals from all such distilled spirits plants 
within that geographic area.
    (c) Penal sum of bonds--(1) Penal sum of a bond covering a single 
plant. A person who files a withdrawal bond for a single plant must 
compute the penal sum of such bond in accordance with Sec. 19.166. If 
the penal sum of such bond is less than the maximum amount, withdrawals 
from the plant may not exceed the penal sum.
    (2) Penal sum of bond covering multiple plants. A person who files 
one withdrawal bond to cover two or more distilled spirits plants must 
compute the required penal sum for each plant individually in accordance 
with Sec. 19.166. The penal sum of the withdrawal bond must be equal 
to, or greater than, the total of the minimum amounts required for the 
individual plants. The bond must show the amount of coverage allocated 
to each individual plant as well as the total penal sum for all plants. 
If the portion of the penal sum allocated to a particular plant is less 
than the maximum amount prescribed in Sec. 19.166 for a single plant, 
withdrawals from that plant must not exceed the amount of the penal sum 
allocated to that plant. The allocation of the penal sum 
notwithstanding, the entire penal sum of the bond must be available to 
satisfy all liability for tax on withdrawals from any and all of the 
covered plants.

(26 U.S.C. 5173)


<R05>
Sec. 19.165  Unit bonds.

    (a) Unit bond covering operations and withdrawals. If a person is 
otherwise required to file bonds for both operations at one or more 
distilled spirits plants and withdrawals from one or more distilled 
spirits plants, the person may instead submit a single unit bond that 
provides all of the guarantees that would otherwise be provided by 
separate operations and withdrawal bonds. The unit bond may also provide 
coverage for operations at adjacent bonded wine cellars. For purposes of 
this section, a person includes a corporation, together with all of its 
controlled subsidiaries, and a controlled subsidiary has the same 
meaning as in Sec. 19.163(b).
    (b) Required penal sum--(1) General. A person must determine the 
penal sum for the unit bond by separately calculating in accordance with 
Sec. 19.166, and then totaling, the amounts needed to cover operations 
and withdrawals at each individual plant covered by the bond. The penal 
sum for the unit bond must not be less than the sum of the minimum penal 
sums that would be required if each of the plants had its own bond.
    (2) Allocation between operations and withdrawals. A unit bond must 
show separately the amount of coverage provided for operations 
(including operations at each adjacent bonded wine cellar if applicable) 
and for withdrawals at each distilled spirits plant covered by the bond.
    (3) Tax liability must not exceed allocated penal sum. If the amount 
of the penal sum allocated to operations at, or withdrawals from, a 
particular plant is less than the maximum amount prescribed in Sec. 
19.166 for a single plant, the tax liability for operations at, or 
withdrawals from, that plant must not exceed that allocated amount.
    (4) Total penal sum available for each plant. Even when the penal 
sum of a unit bond is allocated among multiple plants, the bond must 
provide that the total penal amount of the bond will be available to 
satisfy any liability incurred under the terms and conditions of the 
bond at any plant covered by the bond.

(26 U.S.C. 5173)


<R05>
Sec. 19.166  Required penal sums.

    A person must determine the penal sums for the various bonds 
required by

(26 U.S.C. 5173)


<R05>
Sec. 19.167  Increase of bond coverage.

    (a) When required. If the penal sum of a bond is less than the 
maximum amount specified by Sec. 19.166, and liabilities increase to 
the point where they exceed the bond coverage, the proprietor must 
increase the amount of the bond to cover the increased liability. The 
proprietor must increase the bond coverage either by replacing the 
existing bond with a new, larger bond that covers the entire liability, 
or by supplementing the existing bond with a separate strengthening bond 
in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Strengthening bonds. A strengthening bond is a second bond with 
the same surety as on the original bond which covers the increased 
liability. A strengthening bond must show both its execution date and 
its effective date. TTB will not accept a strengthening bond if it 
contains any term or condition that is a release, or could be 
interpreted as a release, from liability under any former bond, or that 
limits the liability of any bond to less than its full penal sum.

(26 U.S.C. 5173)


<R05>
Sec. 19.168  Superseding bonds.

    (a) General. In any of the circumstances outlined in paragraphs (b) 
through (d) of this section, the proprietor must replace an existing 
bond with a new bond. A new bond that replaces another bond is called a 
superseding bond.
    (b) Surety company no longer acceptable. The proprietor must file a 
superseding bond if the surety on the proprietor's current bond becomes 
insolvent or if the surety is removed from the list of approved sureties 
in Treasury Circular 570. TTB may also require the filing of a 
superseding bond if any other contingency affecting the validity or 
efficiency of the bond arises.
    (c) Change of control. An executor, administrator, assignee, 
receiver, trustee, or other person acting in a fiduciary capacity, 
continuing or liquidating the business of the principal on a bond, must 
either provide TTB with a superseding bond, or obtain consent from the 
surety on each existing bond when assuming control of the business.
    (d) Termination of bond by surety. If the surety applies to 
terminate a bond under Sec. 19.171, and the proprietor wishes to 
continue the activity covered by the bond, the proprietor must file a 
superseding bond that becomes effective on or before the termination 
date of the existing bond. The superseding bond must show both its 
execution date and its effective date.

(26 U.S.C. 5173, 5175, 5176, 5551)


<R05>
Sec. 19.169  Effect of failure to furnish a superseding bond.

    (a) Operations bond. A person may not operate a distilled spirits 
plant without an operations bond. If a person does not submit an 
acceptable superseding operations bond when required to do so under 
Sec. 19.168, the person must immediately discontinue the activities to 
which the lapsed bond coverage relates upon lapse of the existing bond 
coverage.

[[Page 409]]

    (b) Withdrawal bond. A person who does not submit an acceptable 
superseding withdrawal bond when required to do so under Sec. 19.168 
may not withdraw distilled spirits from the bonded premises on a 
deferred basis. Upon lapse of the existing bond coverage the person must 
pay the tax at the time of withdrawal, except in the case of distilled 
spirits withdrawn free of tax or withdrawn without payment of tax under 
26 U.S.C. 5214 or withdrawn exempt from tax under 26 U.S.C. 7510.
    (c) Unit bond. A person who does not provide an acceptable 
superseding unit bond when required to do so under Sec. 19.168 must 
immediately discontinue the business or distilled spirits operations to 
which the lapsed bond coverage relates. Upon lapse of the existing bond 
coverage the person must also pay the tax at the time of withdrawal, 
except in the case of distilled spirits withdrawn free of tax or 
withdrawn without payment of tax under 26 U.S.C. 5214 or withdrawn 
exempt from tax under 26 U.S.C. 7510.

<R05>
Sec. 19.170  Termination of bonds.

    Liability under operations bonds, withdrawal bonds, and unit bonds 
may be terminated for future withdrawals, future production, or future 
deposits as set forth below:
    (a) On application by the surety. A surety may terminate a bond by 
filing a notice as provided in Sec. 19.171;
    (b) By replacement of the bond. A principal may terminate an 
existing bond by replacing it with a superseding bond approved by TTB;
    (c) By discontinuing withdrawals. A principal may terminate a 
withdrawal bond by notifying TTB that the principal has stopped making 
withdrawals covered by the bond, if the bond was filed solely as a 
withdrawal bond; or
    (d) By discontinuing the business. A principal may terminate a bond 
by notifying TTB that the principal has discontinued business.

(26 U.S.C. 5173)


<R05>
Sec. 19.171  Surety notice of relief from bond liability.

    (a) Notice to principal. A surety on a bond may, at any time, notify 
the principal in writing that the surety desires to be relieved of 
liability under the bond.
    (b) Notice to TTB. A surety on a bond may, at any time, notify the 
appropriate TTB officer in writing that the surety desires to be 
relieved of liability under the bond. The notice must specify the date 
after which the surety desires to be relieved of liability. In the case 
of a withdrawal bond, the date specified in the notice must be at least 
ten days after the notice is received by the appropriate TTB officer. In 
the case of an operations bond or unit bond, the date specified in the 
notice must be at least 90 days after the notice is received by the 
appropriate TTB officer. When a surety files a termination notice with 
TTB, the surety must include either an acknowledgement from the 
principal that the principal is aware that the surety is terminating the 
bond or proof that the surety has served the principal with notice of 
its intent to terminate the bond.
    (c) Effect of notice. The bond coverage will end as of close of 
business on the date specified in the notice, provided the surety timely 
filed a proper and complete termination notice, and the surety does not 
withdraw its termination notice in writing prior to the termination 
date. The surety will be released from future liability under the bond 
to the extent set forth in Sec. 19.172.

(26 U.S.C. 5173, 5175, 5176)


<R05>
Sec. 19.172  Relief of surety from bond liability.

    A surety that has provided proper notice under Sec. 19.171 will be 
relieved from liability under the bond in question as set forth below:
    (a) Operations or unit bond. When a superseding bond is submitted, 
the surety will be relieved of future liability related to production 
and deposits that take place after the effective date of the superseding 
bond. However, the surety remains liable for the tax on all distilled 
spirits or wines produced, or for other liabilities incurred, during the 
term of the bond. Further, if a superseding bond is not submitted, the 
surety will remain liable under the bond for all spirits or wines that 
are on

[[Page 410]]

hand or in transit to the bonded premises or bonded wine cellar on the 
date specified in the notice. The liability of the surety will continue 
until all such spirits or wines have been lawfully disposed of, or until 
a new bond has been submitted by the principal covering the spirits or 
wine.
    (b) Withdrawal or unit bonds. The surety will be relieved from 
liability for withdrawals made after the date specified in the notice, 
or upon the effective date of a new bond if one is given.

(26 U.S.C. 5173, 5176)


<R05>
Sec. 19.173  Release of pledged securities.

    Securities that are pledged and deposited with TTB under Sec. 
19.154 will only be released by TTB in accordance with the provisions of 
31 CFR Part 225, Acceptance of Bonds Secured by Government Obligations 
in Lieu of Bonds with Sureties. The appropriate TTB officer will not 
release pledged securities prior to termination of the liability under 
the bond for which they were pledged. When the appropriate TTB officer 
is satisfied that the pledged securities may be released, the official 
will set a date or dates on which a part or all of the securities may be 
released. At any time prior to the release of the securities, the 
appropriate TTB officer may extend the date of release for any 
additional length of time deemed necessary.

                            Tank Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 19.182  Tanks--general requirements.

    The proprietor of a distilled spirits plant must ensure that all 
tanks on the premises used to hold spirits, denatured spirits, or wines 
are:
    (a) Used for the purpose listed on the application and plant 
registration;
    (b) Equipped with accurate means for measuring their contents. If 
the means for measurement is not a permanent fixture on the tank, the 
proprietor must equip the tank with a fixed device for measuring the 
contents. However, tanks having a capacity of less than 101 gallons are 
not required to have permanent gauge devices;
    (c) Accurately calibrated if used for any of the gauges described in 
this part. Further, if tanks or their gauging devices are moved in any 
manner subsequent to original calibration, the tanks shall not be used 
until recalibrated;
    (d) Accessible through walkways, landings, and stairs that permit 
access to all parts of the tank;
    (e) Equipped or situated so that they may be locked or secured; and
    (f) Constructed to prevent access to the spirits or wines through 
vents, flame arresters or other safety devices.

(26 U.S.C. 5006, 5204, 5505)


<R05>
Sec. 19.183  Scale tanks.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
if the proprietor uses a tank to determine the distilled spirits tax 
imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5001, the tank must be mounted on scales and the 
contents of the tank must be determined by weight. The scale tank also 
must be equipped with a suitable device so that the volume of the 
contents can be quickly and accurately determined.
    (b) The requirement to mount tanks on scales does not apply to tanks 
having a capacity of 55 gallons or less. Such tanks may be moved onto an 
accurately calibrated scale when a tax determination gauge needs to be 
made.

(26 U.S.C. 5006, 5204, 5505)

[[Page 411]]


<R05>
Sec. 19.184  Scale tank minimum graduations.

    (a) The beams or dials on scale tanks used for tax determination 
must have minimum graduations not greater than the following:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
           Quantity to be weighed                 Minimum graduation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not exceeding 2,000 pounds.................  \1/2\ pound
Between 2,000 and 6,000 pounds.............  1 pound
Between 6,000 and 20,000 pounds............  2 pounds
Between 20,000 and 50,000 pounds...........  5 pounds
Over 50,000 pounds.........................  10 pounds
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) For scales having a capacity greater than 2,000 pounds, the 
minimum quantity which may be entered onto the weighing tank scale for 
gauging for tax determination will be the greater of:
    (1) 1,000 times the minimum graduation of the scale, or
    (2) 5 percent of the total capacity of the weighing tank scale.
    (c) The weighing of lesser quantities for determination of tax may 
be authorized by the appropriate TTB officer where the beam of the scale 
is calibrated in \1/2\ pound or 1 pound graduations and it is found by 
actual test that the scales are accurate at each graduation.
    (d) Lots of spirits weighing 1,000 pounds or less shall be weighed 
on scales having \1/2\ pound graduations.

(26 U.S.C. 5006, 5204, 5505)


<R05>
Sec. 19.185  Testing scale tanks for accuracy.

    (a) A proprietor who uses a scale tank for tax determination must 
ensure the accuracy of the scale through periodic testing. Testing of 
the scale must be conducted at least every 6 months and whenever the 
scale is adjusted or repaired.
    (b) A proprietor also must test, at least once a month, the 
gallonage represented to be in a scale tank against the gallonage 
indicated by volumetric determination of the contents of the tank. 
However, if the scale is not used during a month, it is only necessary 
to verify against the volumetric determination when the scale is next 
used. The proprietor must make the volumetric determination in 
accordance part 30 of this chapter. If the variation exceeds 0.5 percent 
of the quantity shown in the tank, the proprietor must take appropriate 
action to verify the accuracy of the scale.
    (c) If the appropriate TTB officer determines that a scale may be 
inaccurate, the proprietor must test the accuracy of the scale.

<R05>
Sec. 19.186  Package scales.

    Proprietors must ensure that scales used to weigh packages are 
tested at least every 6 months and whenever they are adjusted or 
repaired. However, if a scale is not used during a 6-month period, it is 
only necessary to test the scale prior to its next use. Scales used to 
weigh packages that hold 10 wine gallons or less must indicate weight in 
ounces or hundredths of a pound.

Sec. 19.187  Pipelines.

    All pipelines, including flexible hoses, that are used to transfer 
spirits, denatured spirits, articles, and wines must be constructed, 
arranged, and secured so as to ensure protection of the revenue and 
permit ready examination. The appropriate TTB officer may approve 
pipelines that cannot be readily examined if they pose no jeopardy to 
the revenue.

    (a) General. A proprietor of a distilled spirits plant must have 
accurate instruments and equipment at the plant for determining the 
proof and volume of spirits.
    (b) Instruments. The hydrometers and thermometers that a proprietor 
uses to gauge spirits must show subdivisions or graduations of proof and 
temperature as specified in part 30 of this chapter. Proprietors must 
frequently test their hydrometers and thermometers to ensure their 
accuracy. If an instrument appears to be in error, the proprietor may 
not use the instrument until

[[Page 412]]

it is tested and certified as accurate by the manufacturer or another 
qualified person.
    (c) Meters. A proprietor may use an accurate mass flow meter to 
measure the volume of bulk spirits. A mass flow meter used for tax 
determination of bulk spirits must be certified by the manufacturer or 
other qualified person as accurate within a tolerance of plus or minus 
0.1 percent. A mass flow meter used for all other required gauges of 
bulk spirits must be certified by the manufacturer or other qualified 
person as accurate within a tolerance of plus or minus 0.5 percent. The 
proprietor must make corrections for the temperature of the spirits 
being measured in conjunction with the volumetric measurement of spirits 
by mass flow meter. The proprietor must also test mass flow meters at 
least every 6 months to ensure that they are accurate within the 
required tolerances.

provide a suitable office at the plant for the exclusive use of the TTB 
officers in performing their duties. The appropriate TTB officer will 
determine if the office facilities are suitable.

(26 U.S.C. 5178)


<R05>
Sec. 19.191  Signs.

    The proprietor must place and keep a conspicuous sign on the outside

<R05>
Sec. 19.192  Security.

    (a) General. The proprietor of a distilled spirits plant must 
provide adequate security measures at the plant in order to protect the 
revenue.
    (b) Buildings. The buildings, rooms, and partitions must be 
constructed of substantial materials. Doors, windows, or any other 
openings to the building must be secured or fastened during times when

    (e) Approved locks. Locks meeting the specifications prescribed in 
paragraph (f) of this section must be used to secure:
    (1) Outdoor tanks used to store spirits, or an enclosure around such 
tanks;
    (2) Indoor tanks used to store spirits, or the door from which 
access may be gained from the outside to the rooms or buildings in which 
such tanks are housed; and
    (3) Any doors from which access may be gained from the outside to 
rooms or buildings containing spirits stored in portable bulk 
containers.

[[Page 413]]

    (f) Specifications for locks. Locks meeting the specifications in 
this section or other locks that have been approved for use by the 
appropriate TTB officer are approved locks for the purpose of 26 U.S.C. 
5682.
    (1) General. The following are the specifications for approved 
locks:
    (i) A corresponding serial number on the lock and on the key, except 
for master key locking systems;
    (ii) A case hardened shackle at least one-fourth inch in diameter, 
with heel and toe locking;
    (iii) A body width of at least 2 inches;
    (iv) A captured key feature (the key may not be removed while the 
shackle is unlocked);
    (v) A tumbler with at least 5 pins; and
    (vi) A lock and key containing no bitting data.
    (2) Other approved locks. If the proprietor wishes to use locks of 
an unusual design, which do not meet the specifications in paragraph 
(f)(1) of this section, the proprietor must submit an example or 
prototype of the lock to the appropriate TTB officer, with a request 
that the lock be approved for use. The appropriate TTB officer will 
evaluate the lock and determine whether the lock should be approved for 
use.
    (3) Master key systems. Master key locking systems using approved 
locks may be used at the option of the proprietor.
    (g) Additional security. Whenever the appropriate TTB officer finds 
that construction, arrangement, equipment, or protection is inadequate, 
additional security (such as fences, flood lights, alarm systems, and 
guard services) must be provided or changes in construction, 
arrangement, or equipment must be made to the extent necessary to 
protect the revenue.

(26 U.S.C. 5178, 5202)


<R05>
Sec. 19.193  Breaking Government locks.

    TTB may assign TTB officers to a distilled spirits plant and utilize 
controls, such as Government locks, if TTB determines that such measures 
are necessary to effectively supervise operations at the plant. The 
proprietor may not remove such Government locks without the 
authorization of the appropriate TTB officer, except when a person or 
property is in imminent danger from a disaster or other emergency. If 
the proprietor must remove Government locks under such circumstances, 
the proprietor must ensure that security measures are taken to prevent 
illegal removal of spirits. In addition, the proprietor must notify the 
appropriate TTB officer as soon as possible of the action taken and 
within 5 days of removing the locks submit a written report describing 
the emergency and the action taken.

             Subpart H_Dealer Registration and Recordkeeping


<R05>
Sec. 19.201  Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart, the following terms have the meanings 
indicated:
    Dealer. A person that sells, or offers for sale, any alcohol product 
(distilled spirits, wines, and/or beer) fit for beverage use.
    Retail dealer in liquors. A dealer that sells, or offers for sale, 
distilled spirits, wines, or beer to any person other than a dealer.
    Wholesale dealer in liquors. A dealer that sells, or offers for 
sale, distilled spirits, wines, or beer to another dealer.

(26 U.S.C. 5121, 5122)


<R05>
Sec. 19.202  Dealer registration.

    Every proprietor that sells or offers for sale any alcoholic product 
(distilled spirits, wines, or beer) fit for beverage use must register 
as a dealer under part 31 of this chapter. However, the proprietor's 
application for registration of a distilled spirits plant filed under 
subpart D of this part, and approval of that application by the 
appropriate TTB officer, will constitute the proprietor's registration 
as a dealer at the distilled spirits plant. Every proprietor registered 
as a dealer under this subpart will be classified as a wholesale dealer 
in liquors (see Sec. 31.32 of this chapter) and as such may also 
operate as a retail dealer in liquors without additional registration. 
Registration covers all sales from the same location, including sales of 
wine, beer,

[[Page 414]]

or other proprietors' spirits. A proprietor who conducts business as a 
dealer at a location other than the distilled spirits plant must 
register and keep records in accordance with part 31 of this chapter.

(26 U.S.C. 5124)


<R05>
Sec. 19.203  Amending the dealer registration.

    Every proprietor registered as a dealer under this subpart must 
maintain a current and accurate distilled spirits plant registration. 
Whenever there is a change to any of the information provided in the 
proprietor's approved notice of registration, the proprietor must amend 
the registration within the time period specified in subpart E of this 
part. An amendment of the proprietor's distilled spirits plant 
registration will also serve as an amendment of the proprietor's dealer 
registration under this subpart. The proprietor's dealer registration 
will also terminate when distilled spirits plant operations under the 
notice of registration terminate.

(26 U.S.C. 5124)


<R05>
Sec. 19.204  Dealer records.

    Every dealer is required to maintain records of transactions. 
Distilled spirits transactions that appear in the records required by 
subpart V of this part will meet the proprietor's recordkeeping 
requirements as a dealer. For other transactions not covered in the 
distilled spirits plant records, such as retail sales of wine or beer in 
a restaurant at the distilled spirits plant, or operations as a 
wholesale dealer in wine or beer, the proprietor must keep the records 
specified for dealers in part 31 of this chapter.

(26 U.S.C. 5121, 5122, 5124)


<R04>
                    Subpart I_Distilled Spirits Taxes


<R05>
Sec. 19.221  Scope.

    This subpart covers the taxation of distilled spirits and the 
procedures for payment of taxes by proprietors of distilled spirits 
plants. Issues covered in this subpart include tax rates, liability for 
tax, tax determination, return periods, filing of tax returns, forms of 
payment, electronic fund transfers, and credits under 26 U.S.C. 5010.

(26 U.S.C. 5001)

              Basic Provisions of Tax Law Affecting Spirits


<R05>
Sec. 19.222  Basic tax law provisions.

    (a) Distilled spirits tax. 26 U.S.C. 5001 and 7652 impose a tax on 
all distilled spirits produced in, or imported into or brought into, the 
United States at the rate prescribed in section 5001 on each proof 
gallon and a proportionate tax at a like rate on all fractional parts of 
a proof gallon. For the current rate of tax see 26 U.S.C. 5001.
    (b) Products containing distilled spirits. All products of 
distillation, by whatever name known, which contain distilled spirits, 
on which the tax imposed by law has not been paid, and any alcoholic 
ingredient added to such products, are considered and taxed as distilled 
spirits.
    (c) Wines with high alcohol content. Wines containing more than 24 
percent of alcohol by volume are taxed as distilled spirits.
    (d) Attachment of the tax. Under 26 U.S.C. 5001(b), the tax attaches 
to distilled spirits as soon as the substance comes into existence as 
such, whether it be subsequently separated as pure or impure spirits, or 
be immediately, or at any subsequent time, transferred into any other 
substance, either in the process of original production, or by any 
subsequent process.
    (e) Alcohol tax is a lien on spirits. Under 26 U.S.C. 5004, the tax 
becomes a first lien on the distilled spirits from the time the spirits 
come into existence as such. The conditions under which the first lien 
terminates are described in 26 U.S.C. 5004.
    (f) Tax credit for eligible wines and eligible flavors. Under 26 
U.S.C. 5010, a credit against the tax imposed on distilled spirits by 26 
U.S.C. 5001 or 7652 on each proof gallon of alcohol derived from 
eligible wine, or from eligible flavors which do not exceed 2.5 percent 
of the finished product on a proof gallon basis is allowed at the time 
the tax is payable as if it constituted a reduction in the rate of tax.

[[Page 415]]

    (g) Effective tax rates. Where credit against the tax is desired, 
the proprietor liable for the tax must establish an effective tax rate 
in accordance with Sec. 19.246. The effective tax rate established will 
be applied to each withdrawal or other taxable disposition of the 
distilled spirits.

(26 U.S.C. 5001, 5004, 5010, 7652)


<R05>
Sec. 19.223  Persons liable for tax.

    (a) Distilling. Under 26 U.S.C. 5005, the distiller of spirits is 
liable for the tax and each proprietor or possessor of, and person in 
any manner interested in the use of, any still, distilling apparatus, or 
distillery, shall be jointly and severally liable for the tax on 
distilled spirits produced. However, a person, not an officer or 
director of a corporate proprietor, owning or having the right of 
control of not more than 10 percent of any class of stock of that 
proprietor, is not liable by reason of the stock ownership or control. 
Persons transferring spirits in bond are relieved of tax liability if:
    (1) The proprietors of transferring and receiving distilled spirits 
plant premises are independent of each other and neither has a 
proprietary interest, directly or indirectly, in the business of the 
other, and
    (2) No person liable for the tax on transferred spirits retains any 
interest in the spirits.
    (b) Storage on bonded premises. Under 26 U.S.C. 5005(c) each person 
operating bonded premises will be liable for the tax on all spirits 
while the spirits are stored on the premises, and on all spirits that 
are in transit to the premises from the time of removal from the 
transferor's bonded premises, pursuant to an approved application. 
Liability for the tax continues until the spirits are transferred or 
withdrawn from bonded premises as authorized by law, or until the 
liability for tax is relieved under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 5008(a). 
Claims for relief from liability for spirits lost are covered in subpart 
J of this part. Voluntary destruction of spirits in bond is covered in 
subpart Q of this part.
    (c) Withdrawals without payment of tax. Under 26 U.S.C. 5005(e), any 
person who withdraws spirits from the bonded premises of a plant without 
payment of tax, as provided in 26 U.S.C. 5214, will be liable for the 
tax on the spirits from the time of withdrawal. The person will be 
relieved of any liability at the time the spirits are exported, 
deposited in a foreign trade zone, used in production of wine, deposited 
in a customs bonded warehouse, laden as supplies upon or used in the 
maintenance or repair of certain vessels or aircraft, or used for 
certain research, development or testing, as provided by law.
    (d) Withdrawals free of tax. Persons liable for tax under paragraph 
(a) of this section, are relieved of the liability on spirits withdrawn 
from bonded premises free of tax under this part, at the time the 
spirits are withdrawn.
    (e) Withdrawn from customs custody without payment of tax. Under 26 
U.S.C. 5232(a) when imported distilled spirits in bulk containers are 
withdrawn from customs custody and transferred to the bonded premises of 
a distilled spirits plant without payment of the tax imposed on imported 
distilled spirits by 26 U.S.C. 5001, the person operating the bonded 
premises of the distilled spirits plant to which spirits are transferred 
will become liable for the tax on the spirits upon their release from 
customs custody, and the importer will thereupon be relieved of 
liability for the tax.

(26 U.S.C. 5005, 5066, 5232)

             Requirements for Gauging and Tax Determination


<R05>
Sec. 19.225  Requirement to gauge and tax determine spirits.

    Before withdrawing distilled spirits from bond, the proprietor must 
gauge the spirits and determine the tax that is due on the spirits. This 
requirement applies to all spirits on which the tax will be either 
prepaid or deferred.

(26 U.S.C. 5006, 5204, 5213)


<R05>
Sec. 19.226  Gauges for tax determination.

    There are several acceptable methods that a proprietor may use when 
gauging spirits for tax determination.
    (a) Cases. If spirits are withdrawn from the bonded premises in 
cases, the proprietor must gauge the spirits based on the contents of 
the cases. The proprietor will determine the number of

[[Page 416]]

proof gallons of spirits in cases as provided in part 30 of this 
chapter. The proprietor must convert metric units of measure to U.S. 
units according to Sec. 19.579.
    (b) Packages. If spirits are withdrawn from the bonded premises in 
packages on the basis of an individual package gauge, each package must 
be gauged unless the tax is to be determined on the production or 
filling gauge. When gauging the packages, the proprietor must prepare a 
package gauge record as specified in Sec. 19.619 and attach it to the 
record of tax determination that is required by Sec. 19.611.
    (c) Tanks. The proprietor must use weight, or an accurate mass flow 
meter and proof as prescribed in Sec. Sec. 19.284 and 19.285, to gauge 
bulk spirits in tanks that are to be withdrawn on determination of tax. 
The proprietor must record the elements of the gauge on the record of 
tax determination. As an alternative, the proprietor may record gauge 
elements on a separate gauge record, and attach the gauge record to the 
record of tax determination.

(26 U.S.C. 5204, 5213)


<R05>
Sec. 19.227  Determination of the tax.

    After gauging, the proprietor must determine the tax on the spirits 
to be removed from the bonded premises. The proprietor must use the tax 
rate prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 5001 to calculate the tax, unless the 
product is eligible for a reduced effective tax rate as provided in 26 
U.S.C. 5010. If the product is eligible for a reduced effective tax 
rate, the proprietor may use that rate to determine the tax. The 
proprietor must record the results of each tax determination in a record 
of tax determination as required by Sec. 19.611.

(26 U.S.C. 5213)

           Rules for Deferred Payment and Prepayment of Taxes


<R05>
Sec. 19.229  Deferred payment and prepayment of taxes.

    There are two basic methods of paying the tax on distilled spirits 
withdrawn from bonded premises: Deferred payment and prepayment.
    (a) Deferred payment. Under the deferred payment system, the 
proprietor may withdraw spirits from bond after tax determination but 
before payment of tax. The excise tax paid is based on the amount of 
spirits removed from bond during each return period. In order to pay 
taxes under the deferral system, the proprietor must file a withdrawal 
bond or unit bond. For detailed information regarding return periods and 
filing requirements under the deferred system, see Sec. Sec. 19.234, 
19.235 and 19.236.
    (b) Prepayment. Under the prepayment system, the proprietor must pay 
the distilled spirits tax after tax determination but before withdrawal 
of the spirits from bonded premises. See Sec. 19.230 for conditions 
that require prepayment of taxes.

(26 U.S.C. 5061)


<R05>
Sec. 19.230  Conditions requiring prepayment of taxes.

    Under certain conditions, the proprietor must prepay the distilled 
spirits tax required, using TTB F 5000.24, Excise Tax Return, before 
removing spirits from the bonded premises. Those conditions are:
    (a) When the proprietor has not given TTB a withdrawal bond or a 
unit bond;
    (b) When the proprietor has posted a withdrawal or a unit bond, but 
has defaulted on any payment of tax under this section, and the tax 
payment remains in default. The proprietor must continue to prepay the 
tax until the appropriate TTB officer decides that allowing the 
proprietor to make deferred tax payments again will not jeopardize the 
revenue;
    (c) When the proprietor receives a notice from the appropriate TTB 
officer that the tax must be prepaid. Such notice may be issued to the 
proprietor if--
    (1) The proprietor fails to maintain records required by this part 
to substantiate the correctness of its tax returns; or
    (2) The proprietor fails to comply with any other provision of this 
part; or
    (d) When the proprietor's withdrawal bond, or the withdrawal 
coverage under its unit bond, is for less than the maximum penal sum. 
The proprietor must prepay the tax to the extent that a

[[Page 417]]

withdrawal would cause the outstanding tax liability to exceed the 
limits of coverage under the bond. See also Sec. 19.231 if the bond is 
for less than the maximum penal sum.

(26 U.S.C. 5213, 5555)


<R05>
Sec. 19.231  Accounting for bond coverage.

    When a proprietor furnishes a withdrawal bond or a unit bond to 
cover the tax on spirits withdrawn on determination of tax, and such 
bond is in less than the maximum penal sum, the proprietor must maintain 
an account for the bond to ensure that outstanding tax liabilities do 
not exceed the penal sum of the bond. The account must charge the bond 
for the amount of liability incurred on each withdrawal on determination 
of tax and, credit the bond for each payment of tax made with a return 
and for authorized credits taken on a return. If the balance of the bond 
account reaches zero, the proprietor may no longer defer tax payments 
for taxable withdrawals. Where the bond is for less than the maximum 
penal sum and has been allocated among two or more plants, the 
proprietor must maintain an account at each plant for that part of the 
penal sum allocated to each plant.

(26 U.S.C. 5173)

                   Requirements for Filing Tax Returns


<R05>
Sec. 19.233  Filing prepayment returns.

    When the proprietor is required to prepay the tax prior to 
withdrawal of spirits from the bonded premises, the proprietor must 
prepay the tax with a return on form TTB F 5000.24, Excise Tax Return, 
and include the remittance with the return. The proprietor may prepay 
tax for one or more withdrawals with a single prepayment return on TTB F 
5000.24. The proprietor will note the serial number of the TTB F 
5000.24, and the date and time of the prepayment on the individual 
record of tax determination. The proprietor may not remove spirits from 
the bonded premises until the tax has been paid.

(26 U.S.C. 5061)


<R05>
Sec. 19.234  Filing deferred payment returns.

    A proprietor must pay the tax on spirits withdrawn from bond for 
deferred payment of tax by filing a return on form TTB F 5000.24, Excise 
Tax Return. The proprietor must execute and file TTB F 5000.24 for each 
return period, even when no tax is due for a particular return period. 
The proprietor of each bonded premises must pay the full amount of 
distilled spirits tax determined for all spirits released for withdrawal 
from the bonded premises on determination of tax during the period 
covered by the return (except spirits on which tax has been prepaid).

(26 U.S.C. 5061)


<R05>
Sec. 19.235  Deferred payment return periods--quarterly and semimonthly.

    (a) Two types of return periods. The IRC provides for two different 
return periods for those taxpayers who pay their taxes on a deferred 
basis: Quarterly and semimonthly. Small taxpayers that meet certain 
criteria are eligible to use quarterly return periods and pay their 
taxes on a quarterly basis. Larger taxpayers must use semimonthly return 
periods and pay their taxes on a semimonthly basis.
    (b) Quarterly return period. Effective January 1, 2006, a taxpayer 
that reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $50,000 in taxes 
with respect to distilled spirits imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5001 and 7652 for 
the current calendar year, and that was liable for not more than $50,000 
in such taxes in the preceding calendar year, may choose to use a 
quarterly return period. However, the taxpayer may not use the quarterly 
return period procedure for any portion of the calendar year following 
the first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the 
taxpayer during the calendar year exceeds $50,000, and any tax which has 
not been paid on that date will be due on the 14th day after the last 
day of the semimonthly period in which that date occurs. The following 
additional rules apply to the quarterly return period procedure under 
this section:
    (1) A taxpayer with multiple locations must combine the distilled 
spirits

[[Page 418]]

tax liability for all locations to determine eligibility for the 
quarterly return procedure;
    (2) A taxpayer that has both domestic operations and import 
transactions must combine the distilled spirits tax liability on the 
domestic operations and the imports to determine eligibility for the 
quarterly return procedure;
    (3) The controlled group rules of 26 U.S.C. 5061(e), which concern 
treatment of controlled groups as one taxpayer, do not apply for 
purposes of determining eligibility for the quarterly return procedure. 
However, a taxpayer that is eligible for the quarterly return procedure, 
and that is a member of a controlled group that owes $5 million or more 
in distilled spirits excise taxes per year, is required to pay taxes by 
electronic fund transfer (EFT). Quarterly payments via EFT must be 
transmitted in accordance with section 5061(e);
    (4) A new taxpayer is eligible to file quarterly returns in the 
first year of business simply if the taxpayer reasonably expects to be 
liable for not more than $50,000 in distilled spirits taxes during that 
calendar year; and
    (5) If a taxpayer filing quarterly exceeds $50,000 in tax liability 
during a taxable year and therefore must revert to the semimonthly 
return procedure, that taxpayer may resume quarterly payments only after 
a full calendar year has passed during which the taxpayer's liability 
did not exceed $50,000.
    (c) Semimonthly return period. Except in the case of a taxpayer that 
qualifies for, and chooses to use, quarterly return periods as provided 
in paragraph (b) of this section, all other taxpayers must use 
semimonthly return periods for deferred payment of tax. The semimonthly 
return periods will run from the 1st day through the 15th day of each 
month, and from the 16th day through the last day of each month, except 
as otherwise provided in Sec. 19.237.
    (d) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms 
have the meanings indicated:
    Reasonably expects. When used with reference to a taxpayer, 
reasonably expects means that there is no existing or anticipated 
circumstances known to the taxpayer (such as an increase in production 
capacity) that would cause the taxpayer's tax liability to exceed the 
prescribed limit.
    Taxpayer. A taxpayer is an individual, corporation, partnership, or 
other entity that is assigned a single Employer Identification Number 
(EIN) as defined in 26 CFR 301.7702.12.

(26 U.S.C. 5061)


<R05>
Sec. 19.236  Due dates for returns.

    (a) Semimonthly returns. Except when payment is pursuant to a 
quarterly return as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, where the 
proprietor of bonded premises has withdrawn spirits from such premises 
on determination and before payment of tax, the proprietor must file a 
semimonthly tax return covering such spirits on form TTB F 5000.24, 
Excise Tax Return, and remittance, as required by Sec. 19.238, Sec. 
19.239 or Sec. 19.240, not later than the 14th day after the last day 
of the return period, except for returns filed for September as provided 
in Sec. 19.237. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal 
holiday, the return and payment are due on the immediately preceding day 
that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, except as provided in 
Sec. 19.237(c).
    (b) Quarterly returns. Where the proprietor of bonded premises has 
withdrawn spirits from such premises on determination and before payment 
of tax, and the proprietor uses quarterly return periods as provided in 
Sec. 19.235(b), the proprietor must file a quarterly return covering 
such spirits on TTB F 5000.24, and remittance, as required by Sec. 
19.238, Sec. 19.239, or Sec. 19.240, not later than the 14th day after 
the last day of the quarterly return period. If the due date falls on a 
Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the return and remittance will be 
due on the immediately preceding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or 
legal holiday.

(26 U.S.C. 5061)


<R05>
Sec. 19.237  Special rule for semimonthly filers for the month of September.

    (a) Returns required for September. If the proprietor is required to 
file semimonthly returns as provided in Sec. 19.235(c), there are three 
return periods during the month of September.

[[Page 419]]

The first semimonthly return period is from the 1st day through the 15th 
day of the month and the return with remittance is due by the 29th of 
September. The second semimonthly return period for the month of 
September is divided into two payment periods. The exact dates of these 
periods depend upon whether the proprietor remits tax payments by EFT.
    (1) Taxpayments by EFT. If the proprietor remits tax payments by 
EFT, the two payment periods for the second half of September are from 
the 16th through the 26th, and from the 27th through the 30th. The 
return on form TTB F 5000.24 and remittance for the period September 16-
26 is due on or before September 29. The return on TTB F 5000.24 and 
remittance for the period September 27-30 is due no later than October 
14.
    (2) Taxpayment other than by EFT. If the proprietor is not required 
to pay the distilled spirits tax by EFT, the two payment periods for the 
second half of September are from the 16th through the 25th and from the 
26th through the 30th. The return on TTB F 5000.24 and remittance for 
the period September 16-25 is due on or before September 28. The return 
on TTB F5000.24 and remittance for the period September 26-30 is due no 
later than October 14.
    (b) Amount of payment: Safe harbor rule.-- (1) EFT Taxpayers. The 
proprietor satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section if by September 29 the amount paid is at least eleven-fifteenths 
(73.3 percent) of the tax liability incurred in the semimonthly return 
period for September 1-15, and the proprietor also pays any underpayment 
of tax resulting from the use of the safe harbor rule on or before 
October 14.
    (2) Other than EFT taxpayers. The proprietor satisfies the 
requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section if the amount paid by 
September 28 is at least two-thirds (66.7 percent) of the tax liability 
incurred in the semimonthly return period for September 1-15, and the 
proprietor also pays any underpayment of tax resulting from the use of 
the safe harbor rule on or before October 14.
    (c) Weekends and holidays. If the required tax payment due date for 
the return period September 16-25 (non-EFT taxpayers) or September 16-26 
(EFT taxpayers), falls on a Saturday or legal holiday, the proprietor's 
return and remittance are due on the immediately preceding day. If the 
required tax payment due date falls on a Sunday, the proprietor's return 
and payment are due on the immediately following day.
    (d)
    Example. Payment of tax for the month of September:
    (1) Facts. X, a proprietor required to pay taxes by electronic fund 
transfer, incurred tax liability in the amount of $30,000 for the first 
semimonthly period of September. For the period September 16-26, X 
incurred tax liability in the amount of $45,000, and for the period 
September 27-30, X incurred tax liability in the amount of $2,000.
    (2) Payment requirement. X's payment of tax in the amount of $30,000 
for the first semimonthly period of September is due no later than 
September 29. X's payment of tax for the period September 16-26 is also 
due no later than September 29. X may use the safe harbor rule to 
determine the amount of payment due for the period of September 16-26. 
Under the safe harbor rule, X's payment of tax must equal $22,000.00, 
eleven-fifteenths of the tax liability incurred during the first 
semimonthly period of September. Additionally, X's payment of tax in the 
amount of $2,000 for the period September 27-30 must be paid no later 
than October 14. X must also pay the underpayment of tax, $23,000.00, 
for the period September 16-26, no later than October 14.

(26 U.S.C. 5061)


<R05>
Sec. 19.238  Payment by mail or courier.

    (a) Payment by mail. The proprietor must file each return on form 
TTBF 5000.24 in accordance with the instructions printed on the form. If 
the proprietor submits the return by U.S. mail, the official postmark of 
the U.S. Postal Service stamped on the cover in which the return is 
mailed will be considered to be the date of delivery of the return and 
also the remittance, if included. If the postmark on the cover is 
illegible, the proprietor will bear the burden of proving when the 
postmark was made. If the proprietor sends the return with or without 
remittance by registered mail or certified mail, the date of registry, 
or the date of the postmark on the sender's postal receipt for certified

[[Page 420]]

mail, will be treated as the date of delivery of the return and also of 
the remittance, if included.
    (b) Payment by courier or other private delivery service. A 
proprietor may send a return, with or without remittance, by courier or 
other private delivery service. If the proprietor sends the return with 
or without remittance with a courier or private delivery service that is 
available to the general public and that is at least as timely and 
reliable as the U.S. mail, and the delivery service has tracking and 
tracing procedures for its deliveries, TTB will consider the date of 
tender to the delivery service as recorded in the tracking and tracing 
record for the parcel as the date of delivery. If the proprietor sends 
the return, with or without remittance, by courier or other private 
delivery service that does not meet the above requirements, the actual 
date of delivery to TTB will be treated as the date of delivery of the 
return and also of the remittance, if included.

(26 U.S.C. 6302)


<R05>
Sec. 19.239  Form of payment.

    (a) General. The proprietor must pay the tax due on spirits when 
filing a return on form TTB F 5000.24, Excise Tax Return. The remittance 
for the tax must accompany the return and may be in any form that is 
authorized by Sec. 70.61 of this chapter and acceptable to the 
appropriate TTB officer. Exception: This does not apply to payments that 
must be made by EFT. For EFT payments see Sec. 19.240.
    (b) Consequences of default. If a check or money order tendered in 
payment of taxes is not paid on presentment, or if the taxpayer is 
otherwise in default in payment, then any remittance made during the 
period of default must be either in cash or by an acceptable certified 
instrument. The proprietor must continue to pay in cash or by certified 
instrument as long as the proprietor remains in default, and until the 
appropriate TTB officer finds that accepting a check will not jeopardize 
the revenue.
    (c) Certified instruments. Acceptable certified instruments include 
certified checks, cashier's checks or treasurer's checks drawn on any 
bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the United States, 
or under the laws of any State, Territory or possession of the United 
States, or a money order, as provided in Sec. 70.61 of this chapter.
    (d) Payment of taxes. The proprietor must make checks or money 
orders payable to ``Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau''.

(26 U.S.C. 5061, 6311)


<R05>
Sec. 19.240  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.

    (a) General. --(1) Criteria requiring ETF payment. Under certain 
conditions, a proprietor may not make payments by cash, check, or money 
order. Instead, the proprietor must use the services of a commercial 
bank to pay tax on distilled spirits tax by EFT. Payments must be made 
by EFT in the current calendar year if the proprietor, as a taxpayer, 
was liable for $5 million or more in taxes on distilled spirits during 
the prior calendar year. For the purpose of determining whether the 
proprietor is subject to this requirement, the proprietor must use the 
total amount of tax liability on distilled spirits incurred under this 
part and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter (gross tax liability). Gross 
tax liability includes the distilled spirits tax on all taxable 
withdrawals of spirits and taxable importations of spirits, as well as 
tax on spirits brought into the United States from Puerto Rico and the 
Virgin Islands during the calendar year. This figure includes taxes 
incurred at any and all premises at which the proprietor conducts 
regulated activities. The proprietor may not net out or adjust for any 
drawback, credits or refunds of tax that are allowed. Overpayments made 
in excess of actual tax liability will not be included in the gross tax 
liability figure.
    (2) Controlled group. If the taxpayer is a member of a controlled 
group, the controlled group is treated as a single taxpayer when 
calculating liability of $5 million or more in distilled spirits taxes 
during the prior calendar year. A controlled group is a related group of 
taxpayers and is defined in subpart D of part 70 of this chapter.
    (3) Separate return and payment for each DSP. When the proprietor 
makes payments by EFT, the proprietor must file a separate return on 
form TTB F

[[Page 421]]

5000.24 and make a separate EFT payment for each DSP from which spirits 
are withdrawn upon determination of tax.
    (b) Requirements--(1) Notice to TTB. If the proprietor's gross 
distilled spirits tax liability is $5 million or more in one calendar 
year, the proprietor must notify the appropriate TTB officer of this 
fact not later than January 10 of the following year. The proprietor 
must use the total amount of tax liability incurred under this part and 
parts 26 and 27 of this chapter to determine whether it must make this 
notification. Exception: this notice requirement does not apply if the 
proprietor already pays tax on distilled spirits by EFT. The notice 
shall be an agreement to make payments by EFT.
    (2) Separate EFT for each return. For each return filed in 
accordance with this part, the proprietor will direct the bank to make 
an EFT to the Treasury Account for the amount of the tax reported due on 
the return. The proprietor must give instructions to the bank early 
enough for the EFT to be made to the Treasury Account by no later than 
close of business on the last day for filing the return as prescribed in 
Sec. Sec. 19.236 or 19.237, as appropriate.
    (3) Discontinuing EFT payments. If the proprietor pays tax by EFT 
and has a gross tax liability of less than $5 million in distilled 
spirits taxes during a calendar year, combining tax liabilities incurred 
under this part and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter, payment by EFT will 
be optional in the following year. The proprietor may continue to remit 
tax payment by EFT as provided in this section, or the proprietor may 
remit taxpayment using any acceptable method as set forth in Sec. 
19.239. If the proprietor decides to stop paying tax by EFT, the 
proprietor must give the appropriate TTB officer written notice of that 
decision. The proprietor must attach a written notice to the first 
return on form TTB F 5000.24 filed using a method of payment other than 
EFT. Such notice must state that tax is not due by EFT because the 
proprietor's tax liability during the preceding calendar year was less 
than $5 million. The proprietor must further state that future tax 
payments will be filed with the returns on TTB F 5000.24.
    (c) Remittance--(1) Identifying EFT payments. When the proprietor 
completes the return on TTB F 5000.24, the proprietor must indicate on 
the form that the tax was paid by EFT. The proprietor must file the 
completed TTB F 5000.24 with TTB as directed by the instructions on the 
form.
    (2) Credit for payment. TTB will credit the proprietor as having 
made a tax payment when the Treasury Account receives the EFT. TTB 
considers the EFT to be received by the Treasury Account when the EFT is 
paid to a Federal Reserve Bank.
    (3) Record of payment. When a proprietor directs a bank to make an 
EFT as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any transfer data 
record furnished to the proprietor as part of normal banking procedures 
will serve as the record of payment. The proprietor will retain this 
document as part of the required records.
    (d) Failure to make a tax payment by EFT. The proprietor will be 
subject to a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5684, 6651, or 6656 for 
failure to make a required EFT tax payment before close of business on 
the last day for filing.
    (e) Procedure. Upon receipt of a notice filed pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will provide the 
proprietor with a copy of the TTB Procedure entitled ``Payment of Tax by 
Electronic Fund Transfer''. This publication outlines the procedure that 
the proprietor must follow when preparing returns and payments by EFT as 
required by this part. The proprietor must follow instructions provided 
by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for submitting the EFT payments 
that must be made to CBP.

            Requirements for Employer Identification Numbers


<R05>
Sec. 19.242  Employer identification number.

    The proprietor must enter the employer identification number (EIN) 
assigned to it by the Internal Revenue Service on each form TTB F 
5000.24, Excise Tax Return, filed with TTB. Failure to enter the 
assigned EIN on TTB F 5000.24, may result in a $50.00

[[Page 422]]

penalty for each occurrence as specified in Sec. 70.113 of this 
chapter.

(26 U.S.C. 6109, 6723)


<R05>
Sec. 19.243  Application for employer identification number.

    (a) Use Form SS-4. The proprietor must obtain an employer 
identification number (EIN) by filing an application with the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) on Form SS-4. Form SS-4 is available from Internal 
Revenue Service Centers, from IRS District Directors, the IRS Web site 
at http://www.irs.gov, or from TTB's National Revenue Center. The 
proprietor may file this form with IRS by mail, telephone, or fax by 
following the instructions on the form.
    (b) Time limit. If the proprietor has not already received, or 
applied for, an EIN at the time that the first return on form TTB F 
5000.24, Excise Tax Return, is filed, the proprietor must file such 
application for an EIN not later than seven days from the date of filing 
the TTB F 5000.24.
    (c) One EIN only. Each proprietor must obtain and use only one EIN, 
regardless of the number of places of business for which the proprietor 
is required to file a tax return under this subpart.

(26 U.S.C. 6109)

                           Effective Tax Rates


<R05>
Sec. 19.245  Tax credits under 26 U.S.C. 5010.

    (a) The distilled spirits tax. Sections 5001 and 7652 of the IRC 
impose a tax on all distilled spirits produced in, or imported into, or 
brought into the United States at the rate prescribed in section 5001 of 
the IRC.
    (b) Tax credits. Section 5010 of the IRC provides a credit for the 
wine and flavors content in distilled spirits products. These credits 
effectively reduce the rate of excise tax paid on distilled spirits 
products that contain eligible wines and eligible flavors. As a result, 
the alcohol derived from eligible wine is taxed at the rates specified 
for wine in 26 U.S.C. 5041, and the alcohol derived from eligible 
flavors is not taxed to the extent that it does not exceed 2.5 percent 
of the alcohol in the product. This results in an effective tax rate on 
the distilled spirits product that is lower than the rate prescribed in 
26 U.S.C. 5001.
    (c) Eligible wine and eligible flavor. The credit for the wine and 
flavor content of a distilled spirits product is allowable only if the 
wine or flavor contained in the product is an ``eligible wine'' or an 
``eligible flavor''. To determine whether a wine or flavor is eligible, 
refer to the definitions in Sec. 19.1 and 26 U.S.C. 5010.
    (d) Application of effective tax rates. Section 19.246 describes how 
the proprietor should compute the effective tax rate for each distilled 
spirits product containing eligible wine or eligible flavor. Sections 
19.247 through 19.250 set forth several different methods that the 
proprietor may use in applying the effective tax rates to taxable 
removals of products from the proprietor's bonded premises.

(26 U.S.C. 5010)


<R05>
Sec. 19.246  Computing the effective tax rate for a product.

    (a) How to compute effective tax rates. In order to determine the 
effective tax rate for a distilled spirits product containing eligible 
wine or eligible flavor, the proprietor must first determine the total 
excise taxes due on the product from all sources including distilled 
spirits, eligible wine, and alcohol from eligible flavors in excess of 
2.5 percent of the total proof gallons in the product. Then, the 
proprietor must determine the total number of proof gallons of alcohol 
in the product regardless of the source. By dividing the total tax 
(numerator) by the total number of proof gallons (denominator) the 
proprietor will arrive at the effective tax rate for the product in 
dollars per proof gallon. The proprietor will compute the effective tax 
rate according to the following formula:
    (1) Numerator. The numerator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product 
(exclusive of distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors), 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001;
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C.

[[Page 423]]

5041(b)(1), (2), or (3), that would be imposed on the wine but for its 
removal to bonded premises. Three different tax classes of wine are 
eligible for the tax credit. The proprietor will have to repeat this 
step for each different tax class of eligible wine used; and
    (iii) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits derived from 
eligible flavors used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate 
prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001, but only to the extent that such distilled 
spirits exceed 2.5 percent of the denominator prescribed in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section.
    (2) Denominator. The denominator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product, 
including distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors; and
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by twice the percentage of alcohol by volume of each, divided 
by 100.
    (b) Rounding numbers--(1) Proof gallons. When determining the 
effective tax rate, the proprietor must express quantities of distilled 
spirits, eligible wine, and eligible flavors to the nearest tenth of a 
proof gallon.
    (2) Tax rates. The proprietor may round the effective tax rate to as 
many decimal places as the proprietor deems appropriate, provided that 
the rate is expressed no less exactly than the rate rounded to the 
nearest whole cent. The proprietor must be consistent and round the 
effective tax rates for all products to the same number of decimal 
places. When rounding, if the number to the right of the last decimal 
place to be kept is less than five, it will be dropped, if it is five or 
over, a unit will be added.
    (c) Example. The  following is an example of the use of the formula.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Proof gallons by which distilled spirits derived from eligible 
flavors exceed 2.5% of the total proof gallons in the batch (100.9 - 
(2.5% x 3,371.8) = 16.6).

[[Page 424]]


(26 U.S.C. 5010)


<R05>
Sec. 19.247  Use of effective (actual) tax rates.

    (a) Select method of applying tax rate. The proprietor may choose to 
apply an effective tax rate to taxable removals of distilled spirits 
products in accordance with Sec. 19.248, Sec. 19.249, or Sec. 19.250. 
Any proprietor who does not elect one of these options must establish an 
effective tax rate for each batch of distilled spirits product on which 
a claim for tax credit for alcohol derived from eligible wine or 
eligible flavor will be made. The proprietor must compute the effective 
tax rates for these products in accordance with the instructions in 
Sec. 19.246.
    (b) Record tax rates used. The proprietor must record the effective 
tax rate used on the dump or batch records for the products as required 
by Sec. 19.598. The proprietor must record the serial numbers of cases 
of product removed at each rate on the record of tax determination or 
other related record. The proprietor must keep these records available 
for inspection by TTB officers.

(26 U.S.C. 5010, 5207)


<R05>
Sec. 19.248  Standard effective tax rate.

    (a) Establishing a standard effective tax rate for a product. The 
proprietor may establish a permanent standard effective tax rate for any 
eligible distilled spirits product, rather than calculate a separate 
effective tax rate for each batch of product made. If the proprietor 
elects to use this option, the proprietor must determine the permanent 
standard effective tax rate based on the least quantity and the lowest 
alcohol content of eligible wine or eligible flavors used to manufacture 
the product. Thus, the permanent standard effective tax rate is the 
highest tax rate that would apply to the product because it is based on 
a batch with the least amount of alcohol from eligible wine and flavors 
that qualify for the credit under 26 U.S.C. 5010. By using this method 
the proprietor forgoes the possible use of a lower tax rate in exchange 
for the convenience of using a permanent standard effective tax rate 
that does not have to be recomputed for each batch of product made. The 
proprietor must keep a permanent record of the standard effective tax 
rates established for each product, in accordance with Sec. 19.615.
    (b) Batches subject to a higher tax rate. Whenever the proprietor 
manufactures a batch of the product with a lesser quantity or lower 
alcohol content of eligible wine or eligible flavor, this will result in 
a higher tax rate on the product since the product will have less 
alcohol qualifying for the credit under 26 U.S.C. 5010 and a higher 
percentage of alcohol taxable at the rate published in 26 U.S.C. 5001. 
In such instances, the proprietor must keep the cased goods segregated 
from other completed cases of the same product subject to the permanent 
standard effective tax rate for that product. The proprietor must 
determine the tax rate for the nonstandard batch in accordance with 
Sec. 19.247.
    (c) TTB review of standard tax rates. If the appropriate TTB officer 
finds that the use of this procedure jeopardizes the revenue, or causes 
administrative difficulty, the proprietor upon notification from TTB 
must discontinue use of this procedure.

(26 U.S.C. 5010, 5207)


<R05>
Sec. 19.249  Average effective tax rate.

    (a) Establishing an average tax rate. The proprietor may establish 
an average effective tax rate for any eligible distilled spirits product 
based on the total proof gallons in all batches of the same composition 
which have been produced during the preceding 6-month period and which 
have been or will be bottled or packaged, in whole or in part, for 
domestic consumption. At the beginning of each month, the proprietor 
must recompute the average effective tax rate so as to include only the 
immediately preceding 6-month period. The proprietor must show the 
average tax rate established for a product in the record of average 
effective tax rates as prescribed in Sec. 19.613.
    (b) TTB review of average effective tax rates. If the appropriate 
TTB officer finds that the use of this procedure jeopardizes the 
revenue, or causes administrative difficulty, the proprietor

[[Page 425]]

upon notification from TTB must discontinue use of this procedure.

(26 U.S.C. 5010, 5207)


<R05>
Sec. 19.250  Inventory reserve account.

    (a) The proprietor may establish an inventory reserve account for 
any eligible distilled spirits product by maintaining an inventory 
reserve record as prescribed by Sec. 19.614. The effective tax rate 
applied to each removal or other disposition will be the effective tax 
rate recorded on the inventory reserve record from which the removal or 
other disposition is depleted. With an inventory reserve account, the 
proprietor will tax pay removals on a first-in first-out basis 
regardless of which lot of product is actually removed.
    (b) If the appropriate TTB officer finds that the use of this 
procedure jeopardizes the revenue, or causes administrative difficulty, 
the proprietor upon notification from TTB must discontinue use of this 
procedure.

                       Assessment of Taxes by TTB


<R05>
Sec. 19.253  Assessment of tax on spirits not accounted for or reported.

    The proprietor is required by law to properly account for and report 
all spirits that it produces. TTB will assess the proprietor for the tax 
on the difference between the quantity reported and the quantity 
actually produced.

(26 U.S.C. 5006)


<R05>
Sec. 19.254  Assessment of tax for losses or unauthorized removals.

    (a) Lost or destroyed in bond. TTB will assess the proprietor for 
the tax on spirits, denatured spirits, or wines in bond that are lost or 
destroyed if:
    (1) The proprietor is liable for the tax on spirits, denatured 
spirits, or wines in bond, and the proprietor fails to file a claim for 
remission of the tax on spirits, denatured spirits, or wines that are 
lost or destroyed in bond as provided in Sec. 19.263(a), or
    (2) The proprietor files a claim for such loss or destruction but 
the claim is denied. Exception: The provisions of this section do not 
apply to spirits, denatured spirits, or wines on which the tax is not 
collectible due to the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 5008(a) or (d), or 26 
U.S.C. 5370, as applicable.
    (b) Unauthorized removal from bond. (1) TTB will assess the 
proprietor for the tax on any spirits, denatured spirits, or wines in 
bond that are removed from bonded premises other than as authorized by 
law.
    (2) TTB will assess the proprietor for tax on spirits or denatured 
spirits lost from casks or other packages as described in 26 U.S.C. 
5006(b) if the proprietor does not pay the tax upon demand by the 
appropriate TTB officer.

                        Additional Tax Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 19.256  Tax on wine.

    (a) Imposition of tax. All wine (including imitation, substandard, 
or artificial wine, and compounds sold as wine) produced in or imported 
into or brought into the United States is subject to tax pursuant to 26 
U.S.C. 5041 or 7652. The proprietor may be liable for wine taxes under 
26 U.S.C. 5362(b)(3) for wine that is transferred in bond to the 
proprietor's distilled spirits plant. The proprietor may not remove wine 
from the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant for consumption or 
sale as wine. (See 26 U.S.C. 5362.)
    (b) Liability for tax. Except as otherwise provided by law, the 
proprietor is liable for the tax on wine transferred in bond to the 
proprietor's distilled spirits plant from a bonded wine cellar or from 
another distilled spirits plant until the proprietor uses the wine in 
the manufacture of a distilled spirits product or properly disposes of 
the wine as provided elsewhere in this part.

(26 U.S.C. 5041, 5362, 7652)


<R05>
Sec. 19.257  Imported spirits.

    The proprietor will incur a tax liability greater than the internal 
revenue tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5001(a)(1), if spirits originally 
imported for nonbeverage purposes are transferred from customs custody 
to TTB bonded premises pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 5232, and the proprietor 
subsequently decides to withdraw the spirits for beverage purposes. If 
the spirits would have been subject to a higher duty had they been

[[Page 426]]

imported for beverage purpose, the proprietor must pay a tax equal to 
the difference between the higher duty and the duty actually paid. 
Proprietors will refer to this additional tax as ``additional tax--less 
duty'' and pay it at the same time and in the same manner as the 
distilled spirits excise tax. Proprietors must compute the amount of

                            Rules for Gauging


<R05>
Sec. 19.284  Quantity determination of bulk spirits.

    (a) Gauge of spirits in packages. When determining the quantity of 
bulk spirits in packages, the proprietor must determine the quantity by 
weight as provided in part 30 of this chapter.
    (b) Bulk gauge for tax determination. When determining the quantity 
of bulk spirits for determination of tax or when performing a production 
gauge that will be used for tax determination, the proprietor must 
determine the quantity by weight as provided in part 30 of this chapter 
or by an accurate mass flow meter. For tax determination purposes, an 
accurate mass flow meter is a mass flow meter that has been certified by 
the manufacturer or other qualified person as accurate within a 
tolerance of plus or minus 0.1 percent.
    (c) Volumetric determination. Except as provided in paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section, in all other instances when the proprietor is 
required to gauge bulk spirits in bond, the proprietor may determine the 
quantity by either weight or volume. When the proprietor determines the 
quantity by volume, the proprietor must measure the spirits by using:
    (1) A tank or bulk conveyance for which a calibration chart is 
provided, with the calibration charts certified as accurate by persons 
qualified to calibrate tanks or bulk conveyances; or
    (2) An accurate mass flow meter. For purposes of this paragraph, an 
accurate mass flow meter is a mass flow meter that has been certified by 
the manufacturer or other qualified person as accurate within a 
tolerance of plus or minus 0.5 percent; or
    (3) Another device or method approved by the appropriate TTB 
officer.

(26 U.S.C. 5559)


<R05>
Sec. 19.285  Proof determination of distilled spirits.

    (a) Proof. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, when 
the proprietor is required to gauge distilled spirits, the proprietor 
must determine the proof in accordance with the procedures prescribed in 
part 30 of this chapter, Gauging Manual.
    (b) Use of Initial proof. After a proprietor has determined the 
proof of distilled spirits in accordance with the procedures in part 30 
of this chapter, a proprietor may use the initial determination of proof 
when required to make a later gauge at the same plant.

[[Page 430]]

However, a proprietor must determine the proof again when:
    (1) A bottling tank gauge is required by Sec. 19.353;
    (2) A gauge for tax determination is required by Sec. 19.226; or
    (3) In any case where the proof may have changed.

(26 U.S.C. 5559)


<R05>
Sec. 19.286  Gauging of spirits in bottles.

    When gauging spirits in bottles, the proprietor may determine the 
proof and quantity from case markings and label information if the 
bottles are full and there is no evidence that tampering has occurred.

(26 U.S.C. 5204, 5559)


<R05>
Sec. 19.287  Gauging of alcoholic flavoring materials.

    Generally, alcoholic flavoring material must be gauged when dumped. 
However, when received from a manufacturer in a closed, nonporous 
container such material may be gauged by using the proof shown on the 
container label or a related statement of proof from the manufacturer. 
When the proof is determined from a label or manufacturer's statement, 
the proprietor will test a sufficient number of samples to verify the 
accuracy of the proof so determined. TTB may require that alcoholic 
flavoring materials be gauged by the methods provided in part 30 of this 
chapter.

(26 U.S.C. 5204, 5559)


<R05>
Sec. 19.288  Determination of tare.

    When packages are to be individually gauged for withdrawal from 
bonded premises, the actual tare must be determined in accordance with 
part 30 of this chapter.

(26 U.S.C. 5204)


<R05>
Sec. 19.289  Production gauge.

    (a) General requirements for production gauges. A proprietor must 
gauge all spirits by determining the quantity and proof as soon as 
reasonably possible after production is completed. Except as otherwise 
provided in this section, a proprietor may determine the quantity by 
volume or by weight, by an accurate mass flow meter, or when approved by 
the appropriate TTB officer, by other devices or methods that accurately 
determine the quantities. If caramel is added to brandy or rum, the 
proof of the spirits must be determined after the addition. Spirits in 
each receiving tank will be gauged before any reduction in proof and 
both before and after each removal of spirits. The gauges must be 
recorded in the records required by Sec. 19.585.
    (b) Tax to be determined on production gauge. If the tax is to be 
determined based on the production gauge, all transaction records must 
be marked ``Withdrawal on Production Gauge.'' A proprietor may determine 
the tax based on the production gauge if the spirits are:
    (1) Weighed into bulk conveyances or metered using an accurate mass 
flow meter;
    (2) Uniformly filled by weight or an accurate mass flow meter into 
metal packages; or
    (3) Filled by weight or an accurate mass flow meter into packages 
for immediate withdrawal from bonded premises with the details recorded 
on a package gauge record in accordance with Sec. 19.619.
    (c) Tax not to be determined on production gauge. If spirits are 
drawn from the production system into barrels, drums, or similar 
portable containers of the same rated capacity and the containers are 
filled to capacity, and the tax is not to be determined on the basis of 
the production gauge, the gauge may be made by:
    (1) Weighing in a tank, converting the weight into proof gallons, 
and determining the average content of each container;
    (2) Measuring volumetrically, in a calibrated tank, converting the 
wine gallons determined into proof gallons, and determining the average 
content of each container;
    (3) Converting the rated capacity into proof gallons to determine 
the average content of each container. Rated capacity will be determined 
from specifications of the manufacturer. The proprietor will determine 
the rated capacity of used cooperage; or

[[Page 431]]

    (4) Determining by an accurate mass flow meter or a device or method 
approved under paragraph (a) of this section, the total quantity filled 
into containers, and determining the average content of each container.
    (d) Records of production gauge. For the production gauge, 
fractional proof gallons will be rounded to the nearest one-tenth and 
the average content and the number of packages filled will be used in 
computing the quantity produced. The actual proof gallons in each 
remnant container must be shown. As provided in Sec. 19.618, a separate 
gauge record will be prepared for each lot of packages filled (see Sec. 
19.485) and for each removal by pipeline or bulk conveyance for deposit 
in bond on the same plant premises. The gauge record will show ``Deposit 
in storage'' or ``Deposit in processing.'' If spirits are to be 
transferred in bond or withdrawn from bond, the production gauge will be 
made on the form or record required by this part (accompanied by a 
package gauge record, if required).

    When a proprietor receives certain materials on bonded premises, the 
proprietor must determine the quantity received and record those 
quantities in the records prescribed by subpart V of this part. This 
requirement applies to:
    (a) Fermenting materials;
    (b) Distilling materials (including nonpotable chemical mixtures 
containing spirits); and
    (c) Spirits, denatured spirits, articles, and spirits residue for 
redistillation.

(26 U.S.C. 5201, 5222, 5223)


<R05>
Sec. 19.294  Removal of fermenting material.

    Material received for use as fermenting material may be removed from 
or used on bonded premises for other purposes. The proprietor must keep 
a record of use or removal as provided in subpart V of this part.

(26 U.S.C. 5201)


<R05>
Sec. 19.295  Removal or destruction of distilling material.

    (a) Distilling material. Generally, a proprietor may not remove 
distilling material from bonded premises before it is distilled. 
However, a proprietor may remove mash, wort, wash, or other distilling 
material:
    (1) To plant premises, other than bonded premises, for use in any 
business authorized under Sec. 19.55;

[[Page 432]]

    (2) To other premises for use in processes not involving the 
production of spirits, alcohol beverages, or vinegar by the vaporizing 
process; or
    (3) For destruction.
    (b) Residues. A proprietor may remove the residue of distilling 
material not introduced into the production system from the premises if 
the liquid is extracted from the material before removal and the liquid 
is not received at any distilled spirits plant or bonded wine cellar. A 
proprietor may return residue of beer used as distilling material to the 
producing brewery. A proprietor may destroy distilling material produced 
and wine and beer received for use as distilling material.

(26 U.S.C. 5201, 5222, 5223)


<R05>
Sec. 19.297  Use of materials in production of spirits.

    A proprietor may produce spirits from any suitable material in 
accordance with the proprietor's statements of production procedure in 
the notice of registration. Materials from which alcohol will not be 
produced may be used in production only if the use of the materials is 
described in the approved statements of production procedure. The 
distillation of nonpotable chemical mixtures as described in Sec. 19.36 
will be deemed to be the original and continuous distillation of the 
spirits in such mixtures and to constitute the production of spirits.

(26 U.S.C. 5172, 5178)

                     Rules for Production of Spirits


<R05>
Sec. 19.301  Distillation.

    The distillation of spirits must be done in a continuous system. 
Distilling operations are continuous when the spirits are moved through 
the various steps of production as quickly as plant operation will 
permit. The proprietor may move the product through as many distilling 
or other production operations as desired, provided the operations are 
continuous. The collection of unfinished spirits for the purpose of 
redistillation is not considered to be a break in the continuity of the 
distilling procedure. However, the quantity and proof of any unfinished 
spirits must be determined and recorded before any mingling with other 
materials or before any further operations involving the unfinished 
spirits outside the continuous system. Before the production gauge, 
spirits may be held only as long as reasonably necessary to complete the 
production procedure.

(26 U.S.C. 5178, 5211, 5222)


<R05>
Sec. 19.302  Treatment during production.

    During production, the proprietor may purify or refine the spirits 
by using any material that will not remain in the finished product. 
Juniper berries and other natural aromatics or their extracted oils may 
be used in the distillation of gin. Spirits may be percolated through or 
treated with oak chips that have not been treated with any chemical. The 
proprietor must destroy or so treat any materials used in treatment of 
spirits, and which do not remain in the spirits, so as to preclude the 
extraction of potable spirits.

(26 U.S.C. 5201)


<R05>
Sec. 19.303  Addition of caramel to rum or brandy and addition of oak
chips to spirits.

    A proprietor may add caramel that has no material sweetening 
properties to rum or brandy in packages or tanks prior to production 
gauge. A proprietor may add oak chips that have not been treated with 
any chemical to packages of spirits prior to or after the production 
gauge. The proprietor must note

[[Page 433]]

the use of oak chips on all transaction records.

(26 U.S.C. 5201)


<R05>
Sec. 19.304  Production gauge.

(26 U.S.C. 5201, 5215, 5223, 5243)


<R05>
Sec. 19.316  Redistillation.

    (a) TTB has established standards of identity for the various 
classes and types of distilled spirits. Those standards are found in 
part 5 of this chapter. If a proprietor intends to redistill spirits, 
the proprietor must ensure that the redistillation process does not 
cause the distillate to be become ineligible for designation in the 
class or type of spirits that the proprietor intends to produce. 
Therefore, spirits must not be redistilled at a proof lower than that 
allowed for the class and type at which the spirits were originally 
produced, unless the redistilled spirits are to be:
    (1) Used in wine production;
    (2) Used in the manufacture of gin or vodka; or
    (3) Designated as alcohol.
    (b) In order to preserve the class and type of spirits during the 
redistillation process, different kinds of spirits must be redistilled 
separately, or with distilling material of the same kind or type as that 
from which the spirits were originally produced. However, this 
restriction does not apply when:
    (1) Brandy is redistilled into ``spirits-fruit'' or ``neutral 
spirits-fruit''. In this case the resulting distillate must not be used 
for producing wine;
    (2) Whiskey is redistilled into ``spirits-grain'' or ``neutral 
spirits-grain'';
    (3) Spirits originally distilled from different kinds of material 
are redistilled into ``spirits-mixed'' or ``neutral spirits-mixed''; or
    (4) The spirits are redistilled into alcohol.
    (c) All spirits redistilled after the production gauge will be 
treated the same as if the spirits had been originally produced by the 
redistiller. Spirits recovered by redistillation of denatured spirits, 
articles, or spirits residues may not be withdrawn from bonded premises 
except for industrial use or after denaturation. Otherwise, all 
provisions of this part and 26 U.S.C. chapter 51 applicable to the 
original production of spirits will be applicable to the redistillation 
of spirits. Nothing in this section affects any provision of this 
chapter relating to the labeling of distilled spirits.

    (a) General. A proprietor must gauge spirits before denaturation and 
after denaturation and must record each gauge in the record of 
denaturation required by Sec. 19.606(b). However, a proprietor is not 
required to gauge either spirits that are dumped from previously gauged 
containers or spirits that are transferred directly to mixing tanks from 
gauge tanks where they were gauged. Measurements of spirits and 
denaturants may be made by volume, weight, accurate mass flow meter, or 
by any other device that has been approved by the appropriate TTB 
officer.
    (b) Denaturation and article manufacture in a single process. When a 
proprietor both denatures spirits and manufactures articles in a single, 
unified process, the proprietor may, in place of the procedure specified 
in paragraph (a) of this section, gauge the spirits before and after 
denaturation in the following manner:
    (1) Gauge the spirits to be denatured by volume, weight, accurate 
mass flow meter, or other device or method approved by the appropriate 
TTB officer;
    (2) Gauge the denaturants to be used by volume, weight, accurate 
mass flow meter, or other device approved by the appropriate TTB 
officer; and
    (3) Compute the number of wine gallons of denatured spirits 
produced, and enter this figure in the record required by Sec. 
19.606(b). In calculating the amount of denatured spirits produced, the

    (a) When making denatured spirits, a proprietor must mix the 
denaturants and spirits only in packages, tanks or bulk conveyances and 
only on bonded premises. A proprietor must thoroughly mix the 
denaturants with the spirits to ensure that all of the spirits are 
effectively denatured.
    (b) If a proprietor wishes to use another method of mixing 
denaturants and spirits not prescribed in this subpart, the proprietor 
must submit to the appropriate TTB officer a written application for 
approval of the alternative method in accordance with Sec. 19.27. TTB 
may require that the proprietor submit additional information, including 
a flow diagram or other

[[Page 443]]

graphic representation of the alternative method, in support of the 
application.

(26 U.S.C. 5242)


<R05>
Sec. 19.385  Making alcohol or water solutions of denaturants.

    If a proprietor uses a denaturant that is difficult to dissolve in 
spirits at normal working temperatures, that is highly volatile, or that 
becomes solid at normal working temperature, the proprietor may liquefy 
or dissolve the denaturant in a small amount of spirits or water prior 
to its use in the production of denatured spirits. However, the proof of 
the denatured spirits produced must not fall below the proof required by 
the approved formula. In addition, if alcohol is used as a solvent, the 
proprietor must include this additional alcohol in calculating the total 
quantity of spirits denatured in the batch.

    A proprietor may add trace amounts of acidic or caustic chemical 
compounds to adjust or neutralize the pH of denatured spirits. However, 
a proprietor may not adjust the pH with any substance that will 
counteract or reduce the effect of the denaturants. A proprietor who 
adjusts the pH of denatured spirits must keep a record of the adjustment 
with reference to the formula number of the treated denatured spirits. 
The record must include the kinds and quantities of chemical compounds 
used for each batch of denatured spirits treated.

(26 U.S.C. 5241, 5242)


<R05>
Sec. 19.387  Ensuring the quality of denaturants.

    (a) General. Proprietors must ensure that the materials they receive 
for use in denaturing conform to the specifications prescribed in part 
21 of this chapter. In addition, the appropriate TTB officer may require 
that a proprietor test the quality of denaturants at any time.
    (b) Testing. A proprietor must comply with the following when 
testing a lot of denaturants:
    (1) Sampling denaturants. Proprietors must use good commercial 
practice when taking samples of denaturants for quality assurance 
testing. Samples of denaturants must be representative of the lot being 
sampled.
    (2) Third party testing. A proprietor may employ an outside 
laboratory or other appropriate third party to test samples of 
denaturants. In the case of a third party test, the proprietor must 
obtain a copy of the analysis or statement of findings signed by the 
chemist who performed the test. On request, the proprietor must provide 
to the appropriate TTB officer samples of denaturants for quality 
control testing in a Government laboratory.
    (c) Substandard denaturants. If TTB or a proprietor finds that a 
material does not conform to the specifications for a denaturant 
prescribed in part 21 of this chapter, the proprietor must immediately 
terminate use of the substandard material as a denaturant. However, the 
proprietor may continue to use the material as a denaturant after 
treating or reprocessing the substandard material to correct the 
deficiency and bring the material into conformity with the applicable 
specifications.

(SDA) from one formula of SDA to another formula of SDA if the resultant 
mixture contains only alcohol and the denaturants listed for an approved 
SDA formula and in the correct concentrations, as set forth in part 21 
of this chapter. Such converted SDA may be used only as authorized in 
part 21 of this chapter.
    (b) Converting SDA to SDA Formula No. 1--(1) All SDA other than SDA 
Formulas No. 3-A and No. 30. A proprietor may convert any SDA, other 
than SDA produced under Formulas No. 3-A and No. 30, into SDA Formula 
No. 1 by adding methyl alcohol and any one of the other alternative 
denaturants listed in Sec. 21.32 of this chapter in accordance with the 
formulation prescribed in that section.
    (2) SDA Formulas No. 3-A and No. 30. SDA Formulas No. 3-A and No. 30 
specify more methyl alcohol than is specified for SDA Formula No. 1. 
Therefore, in order to convert SDA produced under Formulas No. 3-A or 
No. 30 into SDA under Formula No. 1, a proprietor must first add a 
sufficient amount of ethyl alcohol to the SDA in question to bring the 
methyl alcohol content to the proportion prescribed for SDA Formula No.

    (c) Converting SDA to SDA Formula No. 29. A proprietor may convert 
any SDA into SDA Formula No. 29 by adding the amount of acetaldehyde or 
ethyl acetate specified in Sec. 21.56 of this chapter. However, due to 
the presence of other denaturants from the original formula, SDA under 
Formula No. 29 that has been converted from another SDA formula may be 
used only as authorized in Sec. 21.56(b) but not in the manufacture of 
vinegar, drugs or medicinal chemicals, and the conditions governing use 
provided in Sec. 21.56(c) will apply.

[[Page 445]]

    (d) Other conversions of SDA. If a proprietor wishes to make an SDA 
formula conversion other than one authorized in paragraph (a), (b), or 
(c) of this section, the proprietor must obtain approval from the 
appropriate TTB officer prior to the conversion.
    (e) Conversions to completely denatured alcohol. A proprietor may 
convert any SDA from a formula that does not contain methyl alcohol or 
wood alcohol to any one of the completely denatured alcohol (CDA) 
formulas prescribed in subpart C of part 21 of this chapter, by adding 
the denaturants specified for CDA.

    A consignor may reconsign an in-bond shipment of spirits, denatured 
spirits, or wines prior to, or upon, arrival of the shipment at the 
premises of the consignee for any good faith reason. The consignor may 
reconsign the shipment to himself or to another consignee who is 
qualified to receive the shipment and has an adequate bond. In either

or wines by transfer in bond is the ``consignee'' of the shipment for 
purposes of this part. Upon arrival of an in-bond shipment at the 
consignee's premises or at the destination point specified in the 
carrier's transportation documents, the consignee must:
    (1) Examine each conveyance to determine whether the securing 
devices, if any, are intact upon arrival. If the securing devices are 
not intact, the consignee must immediately notify the appropriate TTB 
officer before removal of any spirits from the conveyance;
    (2) Determine, record, and report any losses as required by subpart 
R of this part;
    (3) Acknowledge receipt of the shipment on the transfer record as 
required by Sec. 19.621 or Sec. 24.309 of this chapter and

[[Page 448]]

retain the original of the transfer record and any accompanying 
documents for his files. Retained copies of transfer records will become 
deposit records for purposes of this part; and
    (4) Identify separately any spirits that were produced at an alcohol 
fuel plant. Those spirits may not be withdrawn, used, sold or otherwise 
disposed of for other than fuel use.
    (b) Packages. When a consignee receives spirits in packages, the 
consignee must weigh each package. The consignee must record the 
receiving weight of each package on the accompanying package gauge 
record or on a list according to temporary package serial numbers 
prepared by the consignor. A copy of the package gauge record or list 
must remain with the original transfer record. However, the consignee is 
not required to weigh each package when:
    (1) The transfer is made in a secured conveyance and the securing 
devices are intact on arrival;
    (2) The individual packages were sealed by the consignor and are 
intact on arrival; or
    (3) The requirement for weighing the packages at the consignor's 
premises has been waived under Sec. 19.405(d)(3).
    (c) Bulk conveyances and pipelines. When a consignee receives 
spirits, denatured spirits, or wines by bulk conveyance or by pipeline, 
the consignee must:
    (1) Make a gauge and record the results on the transfer record in 
accordance with Sec. 19.621 or Sec. 24.309 of this chapter. However, 
the appropriate TTB officer may waive the gauging requirement for 
receipts by pipeline upon a finding that there will be no jeopardy to 
the revenue; and
    (2) Ensure that each conveyance is empty and has been thoroughly 
drained.

content of the packages received in the storage records required under 
Sec. 19.590. That gauge also will constitute the basis for entries on 
the package summary records required under Sec. 19.591. If the last 
official gauge indicates a substantial variation in the contents of the 
packages, the proprietor must group the packages into lots according to 
their approximate contents and assign a separate lot identification to 
each group of packages, based on the date the packages were received on 
bonded premises.
    (b) Receipts into processing. When a proprietor receives into the 
processing

                          Securing Conveyances


<R05>
Sec. 19.441  Securing of conveyances.

    (a) Construction for securing. When the securing of a conveyance is 
required by this part, the conveyance must be constructed so that all 
openings, including valves, may be closed and secured.
    (b) Approval of securing devices. Seals, locks or other devices on 
conveyances used to transport taxpaid spirits, denatured spirits 
transferred in bond, or denatured spirits withdrawn free of tax do not 
require approval by TTB. On the other hand, all seals, locks, or devices 
used on conveyances in which spirits are transferred in bond, withdrawn 
free of tax, or withdrawn without payment of tax, require approval by 
the appropriate TTB officer before use. However, cap seals at least 
three-fourths of an inch in diameter, ball-strap-type (railroad) seals 
with a strap at least five-sixteenths of an inch wide, and locking 
security cable with at least a \1/16\-inch cable may be used on 
conveyances without approval by TTB. Such seals must:
    (1) Be made of durable materials;
    (2) Bear the plant registration number or the name, or readily 
recognizable abbreviation of the name, of the proprietor;
    (3) Bear a serial number, including letter prefixes or suffixes, 
which will not be repeated within the following 6-month period;
    (4) Be durably and legibly marked; and
    (5) Be constructed to show evidence of tampering.
    (c) Furnishing and affixing securing devices. The proprietor must 
furnish and affix any seals, locks or other devices used on conveyances. 
However, TTB may require any conveyance in which spirits are transferred 
in bond, withdrawn free of tax, or withdrawn without payment of tax, to 
be secured by a device furnished by TTB and affixed by a TTB officer. 
The securing of a conveyance will be done:
    (1) As soon as the conveyance is loaded for shipment; and
    (2) In such a manner that access to the contents of the conveyance 
cannot be gained without leaving evidence of tampering.

Subpart Q_Return of Spirits to Bonded Premises and Voluntary Destruction


<R05>
Sec. 19.451  Scope.

    The IRC allows a proprietor of a distilled spirits plant to return 
distilled spirits, denatured spirits, and articles to the bonded 
premises of that plant under certain conditions. This subpart covers the 
types of returns allowed, sets forth the procedures that the proprietor 
must follow when returning these products to bonded premises, and 
prescribes rules for voluntary destruction on or off bonded premises.

                Conditions for Return of Spirits to Bond


<R05>
Sec. 19.452  Return of taxpaid spirits to bonded premises for 
destruction, denaturation, redistillation, reconditioning, or 

rebottling.

    (a) Allowable returns. A proprietor may return spirits to bonded 
premises if the spirits were taxpaid or tax determined by him, by 
another distilled spirits plant proprietor, or by an importer upon 
importation through U.S. Customs and Border Protection. However, 
consistent with section 5215(a) of the IRC the proprietor may return 
such spirits to bond only for one of the following reasons:

[[Page 455]]

    (1) Destruction, in accordance with Sec. 19.459;
    (2) Denaturation, in accordance with subpart O of this part;
    (3) Redistillation, in accordance with subpart L of this part;
    (4) Reconditioning; or
    (5) Rebottling.
    (b) Dump and gauge of returned spirits. The proprietor must 
immediately dump spirits returned to bonded premises under this section 
unless the spirits are returned in the sealed metal drums in which they 
were withdrawn. The proprietor must gauge spirits returned under this 
section upon their receipt. The proprietor may gauge spirits in bottles 
based upon the case markings and label information in accordance with 
Sec. 19.286.
    (c) Claims for credit or refund of tax. A proprietor may file a 
claim under Sec. 19.264 for credit or refund of tax on spirits returned 
to bonded premises under this section. In addition to the information 
specified in Sec. 19.264, a proprietor filing a claim for credit or 
refund of tax must have on file at the plant where spirits are returned 
to bond the following documentation for each lot of spirits returned:
    (1) Documentation that establishes the amount of tax for which the 
claim for credit or refund is filed. If the spirits contain eligible 
wine or eligible flavors, the proprietor must have on file a copy of the 
record of tax determination as prescribed by Sec. 19.611, or other 
documentation that establishes the rate of tax that was paid on the 
product. In lieu of establishing the actual effective tax rate of the 
product, the proprietor may claim a credit or refund based on the lowest 
effective tax rate applied to the product; and
    (2) Credit memoranda or comparable financial records evidencing the 
return of each lot of spirits.
    (d) Applicability of Chapter 51 of the IRC. All provisions of 
chapter 51 of the IRC and of this part that apply to spirits under TTB 
bond also apply to spirits when returned to bond under this section.

(26 U.S.C. 5008, 5010, 5201, 5207, 5215)


<R05>
Sec. 19.453  Return of bottled spirits for relabeling or reclosing.

    A proprietor may return bottled distilled spirits to his bonded 
premises for relabeling or reclosing. When bottled spirits are returned 
for relabeling or reclosing, the proprietor may not claim credit or 
refund of tax on the returned spirits, and no tax will be due on their 
subsequent removal. The proprietor must relabel or reclose the bottles 
immediately and must promptly remove the spirits from bonded premises. 
The provisions of Sec. 19.363 apply to relabeling and reclosing 
performed under this section.

(26 U.S.C. 5215)


<R05>
Sec. 19.454  Other authorized returns to bonded premises.

    In addition to the returns to bonded premises specified in 
Sec. Sec. 19.452 and 19.453, there are other permissible returns of 
distilled spirits products to a proprietor's bonded premises. These 
other products, the purposes for which they may be returned, and the 
conditions for their return are listed in the table below. All of these

                     Subpart R_Losses and Shortages


<R05>
Sec. 19.461  Losses and shortages in general.

    (a) Allowable losses and shortages. Except as otherwise provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, TTB will not collect tax on spirits, 
denatured spirits, or wines that are lost, destroyed, or otherwise 
unaccounted for while in bond, and if the tax has already been paid, TTB 
will refund the tax.
    (b) Exceptions. TTB will collect the tax in the case of:
    (1) Theft, unless the appropriate TTB officer finds that the theft 
occurred without connivance, collusion, fraud or negligence on the part 
of the proprietor, owner, consignor, consignee, bailee, or carrier, or 
any employee or agent of any of them;
    (2) Voluntary destruction carried out other than as provided in 
subpart Q of this part;
    (3) An unexplained shortage of bottled spirits.
    (c) Burden of proof. When it appears that a theft occurred, the 
burden of proof will be on the proprietor or other person liable for the 
tax to establish to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that 
the theft did not result from connivance, collusion, fraud, or 
negligence on the part of the proprietor, owner, consignor, consignee, 
bailee, or carrier, or any employee or agent of any of them.
    (d) Claims. Claims for losses and shortages allowable under this 
section must be filed in accordance with the provisions of subpart J of 
this part.
    (e) Limitations. TTB will abate, remit, credit, or refund taxes on 
spirits, denatured spirits, or wines lost by theft only to the extent 
that the claimant is not indemnified against, or recompensed for, the 
taxes paid or owed.

(26 U.S.C. 5008, 5370)


<R05>
Sec. 19.462  Determination of losses in bond.

    (a) Times for determining losses. A proprietor must determine at any 
of the following times whether a loss of spirits, denatured spirits, or 
wines has occurred:
    (1) Each time a tank or bulk conveyance is emptied;

[[Page 458]]

    (2) Upon discovery of an accident or an unusual variation in a 
gauge; and
    (3) When required to take a physical inventory.
    (b) Losses from theft, tampering, or unauthorized voluntary 
destruction. Whenever any spirits, denatured spirits, or wines are lost 
or destroyed in bond, whether by theft, tampering, or unauthorized 
voluntary destruction, the proprietor may elect voluntarily to pay the 
tax on the quantity lost. If the proprietor does not elect to pay the 
tax, the proprietor must promptly report the loss or destruction to the 
appropriate TTB officer. TTB may require that the proprietor file any 
claim for relief from the tax in accordance with Sec. 19.263.
    (c) Missing packages. When a proprietor cannot locate or otherwise 
account for any packages of spirits, denatured spirits, or wine recorded 
as deposited on bonded premises, the proprietor must promptly report 
that fact to the appropriate TTB officer. In such case the proprietor 
must either pay the tax on the lost spirits, denatured spirits, or wines 
or file a claim for relief from the tax in accordance with Sec. 19.263.
    (d) Excessive in-transit losses. A proprietor must promptly report 
excessive in-transit losses to the appropriate TTB officer. As a general 
rule, when spirits, denatured spirits, or wines are received in bond in 
bulk conveyances TTB will consider as excessive a loss that exceeds 1 
percent of the quantity consigned. However, in the case of 
transcontinental transfers of wine in bond, TTB will consider as 
excessive only a loss in excess of 2 percent of the quantity of wine 
consigned.
    (e) Excessive storage losses. A proprietor must pay the tax on 
excessive storage account losses of spirits unless the proprietor files 
a claim for remission in accordance with Sec. 19.263 and TTB allows the 
claim under Sec. 19.268. TTB will consider a storage account loss as 
excessive when the quantity of spirits lost during a calendar quarter 
from all storage tanks and stored bulk conveyances exceeds 1.5 percent 
of the total quantity contained in the tanks and stored bulk conveyances 
during the calendar quarter.

(26 U.S.C. 5008, 5370)


<R05>
Sec. 19.463  Loss of spirits from packages.

    (a) Tampering or theft. The appropriate TTB officer may require that 
a proprietor pay the tax on any loss caused by tampering or theft of 
spirits from packages in storage unless the proprietor establishes to 
the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the loss was not 
due to connivance, collusion, fraud or negligence on the part of the 
proprietor. As a general rule, the tax will be assessed on the quantity 
of spirits that represents the difference between the quantity 
originally entered in the package and the quantity remaining after 
discovery of the tampering or theft. However, if the proprietor can show 
that the package had already sustained normal storage losses before the 
tampering or theft occurred, the proprietor may exclude the amount of 
the normal storage losses from the quantity to be taxpaid.
    (b) Alternative method of tax assessment. If tampering or theft has 
occurred at a proprietor's plant and the proprietor has failed to use 
effective controls to prevent it, the appropriate TTB officer may use an 
alternative to the general method of tax assessment specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section. In this case, the appropriate TTB officer 
may assess on each package showing evidence of tampering or theft an 
amount equal to the tax on 5 proof gallons of spirits.

(26 U.S.C. 5006)


<R05>
Sec. 19.464  Losses after tax determination.

    If a proprietor sustains a loss of spirits after tax determination 
but prior to completion of physical removal of the spirits from bonded 
premises, the proprietor may file a claim in accordance with subpart J 
of this part.

(26 U.S.C. 5008)


<R05>
Sec. 19.465  Shortages of bottled spirits.

    (a) Determination of shortage. The determination of whether an 
unexplained shortage of bottled distilled spirits exists must be made by 
comparing the spirits recorded as being on hand to either the results of 
the physical inventory required by Sec. 19.372 or the results of any 
other complete physical inventory taken by the proprietor. When the

[[Page 459]]

recorded quantity is greater than the quantity determined by physical 
inventory, the difference is an unexplained shortage. The proprietor 
must adjust its records to reflect the results of the physical 
inventory.
    (b) Payment of tax on shortage. A proprietor must pay the tax on any 
unexplained shortage of bottled distilled spirits:
    (1) Immediately on a prepayment return on form TTB F 5000.24, Excise 
Tax Return; or
    (2) On a deferred payment return on TTB F 5000.24 for the period 
during which the shortage was determined.

(26 U.S.C. 5206)


<R05>
Sec. 19.472  Need to determine use of spirits--industrial or 
nonindustrial.

    Many of the container and marking requirements set forth in this 
subpart are based on the intended use of the spirits, that is, whether 
they are for ``industrial'' or ``nonindustrial'' use. For purposes of 
this subpart, the terms ``industrial'' use and ``nonindustrial'' use 
refer to the uses specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (a) Industrial use. The word ``industrial'' when used with reference 
to the use of spirits has the same meaning as in Sec. Sec. 1.60 and 
1.62 of this chapter. Those uses are as follows:
    (1) Free of tax by, and for the use of, the United States or any 
governmental agency thereof, any State, any political subdivision of a 
State, or the District of Columbia, for nonbeverage purposes;
    (2) Free of tax for nonbeverage purposes and not for resale or use 
in the manufacture of any product for sale--

learning;
    (ii) For any laboratory for use exclusively in scientific research;
    (iii) For use at any hospital, blood bank, or sanitarium (including 
use in making analysis or test at such hospital, blood bank, or 
sanitarium), or at any pathological laboratory exclusively engaged in 
making analyses, or tests, for hospitals or sanitariums; or
    (iv) For the use of any clinic operated for charity and not for 
profit (including use in compounding of bona fide medicines for 
treatment outside of such clinics of patients thereof);
    (3) Free of tax, after denaturation of such spirits in the manner 
prescribed by law for--
    (i) Use in the manufacture of ether, chloroform, or other definite 
chemical substance where such distilled spirits are changed into some 
other chemical substance and do not appear in the finished product; or
    (ii) Any other use in the arts and industries (except for uses 
prohibited by 26 U.S.C. 5273 (b) or (d)) and for fuel, light, and power; 
and
    (4) The use of distilled spirits for experimental purposes and in 
the manufacture of--
    (i) Medicinal, pharmaceutical, or antiseptic products, including 
prescriptions compounded by retail druggists;
    (ii) Toilet preparations;
    (iii) Flavoring extracts, syrups, or food products; or
    (iv) Scientific, chemical, mechanical, or industrial products, 
provided such products are unfit for beverage use.
    (b) Nonindustrial use. The word ``nonindustrial'' when used with 
reference to the use of spirits refers to any use not listed as an 
``industrial'' use in paragraph (a) of this section. Nonindustrial uses 
include the following:
    (1) For beverage purposes;
    (2) In the manufacture, rectification, or blending of alcoholic 
beverages; or in the preparation of food or drink by a hotel, 
restaurant, tavern, or similar establishment; or as a medicine; and
    (3) Distilled spirits in containers with a capacity of 1 wine gallon 
or less,

other than anhydrous alcohol and alcohol that may be withdrawn from bond 
free of tax.

on bonded premises for the original entry of spirits, and for filling 
from tanks, storing, transferring in bond, and withdrawing taxpaid 
spirits and denatured spirits. A proprietor may use such a bulk 
conveyance to withdraw spirits free of tax, in accordance with the 
provisions of this part, for use of the United States or to a specified 
consignee if so authorized by the appropriate TTB officer under Sec. 
19.473(b). A proprietor may also use such a bulk conveyance to withdraw

Sec. 19.487  Kind of spirits.

    (a) Designation. The designations of kind of spirits required for 
packages filled on bonded premises must be consistent with the classes 
and types of spirits set forth in part 5 of this chapter subject to the 
following exceptions or conditions:
    (1) A proprietor may designate as ``Alcohol'' spirits distilled at 
more than 160 proof, which lack the taste, aroma, and other 
characteristics generally attributed to whisky, brandy, rum, or gin, and 
which are substantially neutral in character. When alcohol so designated 
is withdrawn on determination of tax, the designation must consist of 
the word ``Alcohol'' preceded or followed by a word or phrase that 
describes the material from which the alcohol was produced;
    (2) The designation for vodka, neutral spirits, or gin must include 
a word or phrase that describes the material from which the spirits were 
produced;
    (3) A proprietor may designate as ``Spirits'', preceded or followed 
by a word or phrase that describes the material from which the spirits 
were produced, those distilled spirits that are distilled at less than 
190 proof which lack the taste, aroma, and other characteristics 
generally attributed to whisky, brandy, rum, or gin. However, the 
proprietor may not designate such spirits as ``Spirits grain'' or 
``Grain spirits'';
    (4) A proprietor must designate spirits distilled from fruit at or 
above 190 proof, if intended for use in wine production, as ``Neutral 
Spirits--Fruit'', preceded or followed by the name of the fruit from 
which the spirits were produced;
    (5) A proprietor may designate as ``Whisky'' spirits distilled at 
not more than 160 proof from a fermented mash of not less than 51 
percent rye, corn, wheat, malted barley, or malted rye grain, packaged 
in reused cooperage, provided that the designation is further qualified 
with the words ``Distilled from rye mash'' (or bourbon, wheat, malt, or 
rye malt mash, as the case may be). However, spirits designated as 
``Whisky'' must, if distilled from a fermented mash of not less than 80 
percent corn, carry the designation ``Corn Whisky.''
    (b) Change of designation. After written application to, and 
approval of, the appropriate TTB officer, a proprietor may at any time 
before their withdrawal from bonded premises, change the original 
designation for spirits to a new designation properly describing the 
spirits in accordance with the provisions of this section.
    (c) Other designations. If a proprietor proposes to produce spirits 
for which a designation has not been prescribed in this section or in 
part 5 of this chapter, the proprietor must first make written 
application to the appropriate TTB officer for a designation for such 
spirits, and the proprietor must then designate the spirits accordingly.
    (d) Spirits for nonindustrial use. A proprietor may not treat the 
provisions of this section as constituting authorization to apply 
designations to spirits withdrawn for nonindustrial use if those 
designations do not conform to the requirements of part 5 of this 
chapter.

packages consecutively beginning with ``1'' and continuing the series 
until the number ``1,000,000'' is reached, except that any series of

TTB officer. The proprietor must identify remnant cases by placing the 
identifier of the last full case followed by the letter ``R'' on the 
remnant case. When there is a change in the name, or trade name of the 
proprietor, all series in use may be continued. However, if there is a 
change in proprietorship, a new series must be commenced.
    (d) Alternative marking for spirits for industrial use. A proprietor 
may mark packages and cases of spirits for industrial use, including 
denatured spirits, filled in processing with the lot identification

If the bottler is the proprietor of more than one distilled spirits 
plant engaged in bottling operations, the label may include the 
addresses of all such plants immediately following the name (or trade 
name) of the bottler. The following additional rules apply to name and 
address labeling under this section:
    (a) Where distilled spirits are bottled by or for the distiller of 
the spirits, the label may state, in lieu of the words ``Bottled by'', 
``Packed by'', or ``Filled by'', followed by the bottler's name (or 
trade name) and address or addresses, the words ``Distilled by'', 
followed immediately by the name (or trade name) under which the

were distilled, and the address (or addresses) of the distiller;
    (b) Where ``straight whiskies'' of the same type produced in the 
same State by two or more different distillers are combined (either at 
time of bottling or at a warehouseman's bonded premises for further 
storage) and are subsequently bottled and labeled as ``straight 
whisky'', that ``straight whisky'' must be labeled as provided in the 
introductory paragraph of this section. However, where that combined 
``straight whisky'' is bottled by or for the distillers of the whiskies, 
the label may contain, in lieu of the wording specified in that 
introductory paragraph, the words ``Distilled by'', followed immediately 
by the name (or

[[Page 469]]

trade name) of each distiller that distilled a portion of the ``straight 
whisky'', the address of each of the distilled spirits plants where a 
portion of the ``straight whisky'' was distilled, and the percentage of 
``straight whisky'' distilled by each distiller (with a tolerance of 
plus or minus 2 percent). In addition, where ``straight whisky'' is made 
up of a mixture of ``straight whiskies'' of the same type distilled at 
two or more distilled spirits plants of the same proprietor located 
within the same State, and where that ``straight whisky'' is bottled by 
or for that proprietor, the label for the ``straight whisky'' may 
contain, in lieu of the wording specified in the introductory paragraph 
of this section, the words ``Distilled by'' followed by the name (or 
trade name) of the proprietor and the address of each of the distilled 
spirits plants that distilled a portion of the ``straight whisky'';
    (c) Where distilled spirits are bottled by or for the proprietor of 
a distilled spirits plant, the label may state, in lieu of the words

preceded immediately by the words ``Bottled for'', ``Distributed by'', 
or other similar statement; and
    (e) The label may state the address of the proprietor's principal 
place of business in lieu of the place where the bottling, distilling or 
processing operation occurred, provided that the address where the 
bottling, distilling, or other operation occurred is indicated by 
printing, coding, or other markings, on the label or on the bottle. The 
coding system employed must permit TTB to determine where the operation 
stated on the label occurred. Prior to using such a label or bottle 
coding system, the proprietor must send a notice to the appropriate TTB 
officer explaining the coding system.

language of the country to which the spirits are to be exported provided 
that the proprietor maintains on file an English translation of that 
information. The export label may state the net contents and percentage 
of alcohol by volume in the units of measurement of the foreign country, 
provided that the proprietor maintains a record of the equivalent units 
as required for labels of spirits bottled for domestic consumption.
    (d) Waiver. The appropriate TTB officer may waive the requirement to 
show any information required by this section, other than the kind of 
spirits, upon a showing that the country to which the spirits are to be 
exported prohibits the showing of such information. In regard to kind 
(class and type) of spirits, the appropriate TTB officer may waive the 
designation required by Sec. 5.22 of this chapter, only to the extent 
that the label need not bear the word ``diluted'' for distilled spirits 
bottled below the minimum bottling proof, and provided that this is in 
accordance with the rules of the country to which the product is to be 
exported.

must maintain. In general, a proprietor is responsible for recording 
activities and transactions related to the three primary operational 
accounts at a plant: production, storage, and processing. A proprietor's 
records must show receipts in each account, movement from one account to 
another, transfers in bond, and withdrawals of spirits, denatured 
spirits, articles, or wines. The types of records that a proprietor must 
keep include:
    (a) All individual transaction forms, records, and summaries that 
are specifically required by this part;
    (b) All supplemental, auxiliary, and source data that a proprietor 
uses to compile required forms, records, and summaries, and to prepare

proprietors to keep their records in any particular format or medium. 
For example, a proprietor may keep required records on paper, on 
microfilm or microfiche, or on a computer or other electronic medium, so 
long as the records are readily retrievable in hardcopy format for 
review by TTB officers as necessary. The required records may consist of 
documents created in the ordinary course of business, rather than 
documents created expressly to meet the requirements of this part, 
provided that those documents:
    (a) Contain all of the relevant information required under this 
part;
    (b) Are consistent with the general standards of clarity and 
accuracy; and
    (c) Can be readily understood by TTB personnel.

distilled spirits plant where operations or transactions occur, the 
proprietor must provide a letterhead notice to the Director, National 
Revenue Center, of the location where the records are kept.

<R05>
Sec. 19.683  Changes affecting permit applications.

    (a) General. If there is a change relating to any of the information 
contained in, or considered a part of, the application on form TTB F 
5110.74, Application and Permit for an Alcohol Fuel Producer Under 26 
U.S.C. 5181, the proprietor must amend the information previously 
submitted within 30 days of the change unless another time period is 
specified in this subpart.
    (b) Amended TTB F 5110.74. Except when a letterhead application or 
letterhead notice procedure is followed under this subpart, the 
proprietor must submit an amended application to the appropriate TTB 
officer on TTB F 5110.74 within 30 days of a change referred to in 
paragraph (a) of this section if the change affects the terms and 
conditions of the permit.
    (c) Letterhead applications. For the changes specified in Sec. Sec. 
19.685(c), 19.686, and 19.690 of this subpart, the proprietor may submit 
a letterhead application to the appropriate TTB officer for a change 
instead of filing an amended TTB F 5110.74. A letterhead application 
must be on letterhead signed by an authorized representative of the 
permit holder. The letterhead application must identify the alcohol fuel 
plant to which the application applies. The letterhead application

submit an amended application on TTB F 5110.74 if administrative 
difficulties occur as a result of the letterhead notice.

(26 U.S.C. 5271, 5181)


<R05>
Sec. 19.684  Automatic termination of permits.

    (a) Permits not transferable. An alcohol fuel plant permit is not 
transferable and, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, will automatically terminate if:
    (1) The operations that are authorized by the permit are leased, 
sold, or transferred to another person; or
    (2) The permit holder is dissolved on a date certain or upon an 
event specified by the laws of the State where the permit holder 
operates.
    (b) Corporations. In the case of a corporation holding a permit 
under this subpart, if actual or legal control of that corporation 
changes, directly or indirectly, whether by reason of change in stock 
ownership or control (in the permittee corporation or in any other 
corporation), by operation of law, or in any other manner, the permit 
may remain in effect until the expiration of 30 days after the change, 
whereupon the permit will automatically terminate. However, if 
operations are to be continued after the change in control, and an 
application for a new permit is filed within 30 days of the change, the 
outstanding permit may remain in effect until final action is taken on 
the new application. When final action is taken on the application, the 
outstanding permit will automatically terminate.

    (a) Small plants. If the proprietor of a small plant intends to 
increase production (including receipts) to more than 10,000 proof 
gallons of spirits per calendar year, the proprietor must first obtain 
an amended permit by filing an application for a medium plant or a large 
plant, as appropriate, under Sec. Sec. 19.675 or 19.676. If any of the 
required information is already on file with TTB, that information may 
be incorporated by reference in the new application. The proprietor must 
also provide a new or strengthening bond in accordance with Sec. Sec. 
19.699 and 19.700.
    (b) Medium plants. If the proprietor of a medium plant intends to 
increase production (including receipts) to more than 500,000 proof 
gallons of spirits per

[[Page 495]]

calendar year, the proprietor must first obtain an amended permit by 
filing an application for a large plant under Sec. 19.676. If any of 
the required information is already on file with TTB, that information 
may be incorporated by reference in the new application. If the penal 
sum of the proprietor's current bond is below the amount specified for 
the new production level, the proprietor must obtain a new or 
strengthening bond in accordance with Sec. 19.700.
    (c) Curtailment of activities. A proprietor of a medium or large 
plant who curtails operations to a level whereby the proprietor is 
eligible to requalify as a small or medium plant may so qualify by 
submitting a letterhead application to the appropriate TTB officer for 
approval. If the appropriate TTB officer approves the application, the 
proprietor automatically will be relieved of those regulatory 
requirements that apply only to the superseded qualification. In 
addition, in the case of a change to small plant status, the proprietor 
may be allowed to terminate the bond in accordance with the procedure 
set forth in Sec. 19.170 of this part.

                                  Bonds


<R05>
Sec. 19.699  General bond requirements.

    (a) Operations bond. Any person who plans to establish a large 
plant, a medium plant, or a small plant without production operations 
must provide an operations bond on form TTB F 5110.56, Distilled Spirits 
Bond, in duplicate, with the original permit application. If a 
proprietor fails to fails to pay any liability covered by the bond, TTB 
may seek payment from the proprietor, from the surety on the bond, or 
from both the proprietor and the surety. Additional provisions 
applicable to bonds for alcohol fuel plants are found in subpart F of 
this part in Sec. Sec. 19.155 through 19.157 and Sec. Sec. 19.167 
through 19.173.
    (b) Corporate surety. A company that issues bonds is called a 
``corporate surety.'' Proprietors must obtain the surety bonds required 
by this subpart from a corporate surety approved by the Secretary of the 
Treasury. The Department of the Treasury publishes a list of approved 
corporate sureties in Treasury Department Circular No. 570, ``Companies 
Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Sureties on Federal 
Bonds and as Acceptable Reinsuring Companies.'' Circular No. 570 is 
published annually in the Federal Register. The most current edition of 
the circular is posted at the Web site of the Financial Management 
Service, Department of the Treasury, at http://www.fms.treas.gov/c570. 
Printed copies of Circular No. 570 are available for purchase from the 
Government Printing Office.
    (c) Alternative to a corporate surety. A proprietor may also 
guarantee payment under a bond without using a corporate surety, by 
filing a bond that guarantees payment of the liability by pledging and 
depositing one or more acceptable negotiable securities having a par 
value (face amount) equal to or greater than the penal sums of the 
required bonds. Should the proprietor fail to pay one or more of the 
guaranteed liabilities, TTB may take action to sell the deposited 
securities to satisfy the debt. Pledged securities will be released to 
the proprietor if there are no outstanding liabilities when the bond is 
terminated; the provisions of Sec. 19.173 apply to the release of 
pledged securities under this subpart. A list of securities acceptable 
as collateral in lieu of surety bonds is available from the Bureau of 
the Public Debt, Office of the Commissioner, Government Securities 
Regulations Staff. Current information and guidance from the Bureau of 
the Public Debt Web site may be found at http://
www.publicdebt.treas.gov.

<R05>
Sec. 19.700  Amount of bond.

    A proprietor must determine the penal sum of the bond based on the 
total quantity of distilled spirits that will be produced and received 
during a calendar year. The method for computing required bond amounts 
is as follows:
    (a) Small plants without production operations. A proprietor that 
operates a small plant that receives not more than 10,000 proof gallons 
of spirits per year and does not conduct bona fide production operations 
must provide a bond with a penal sum of $1,000.
    (b) Medium plants. A proprietor that operates a medium plant that 
produces and receives more than 10,000 but not more than 20,000 proof 
gallons of spirits per year must provide a bond with a penal sum of at 
least $2,000.00. The proprietor must increase the penal sum of the bond 
by $1,000 for each additional 10,000 gallons, or fraction of 10,000 
gallons, (over 20,000 gallons) that will be produced or received. The 
maximum bond for a medium plant is $50,000.00, representing the penal 
sum applicable to 500,000 proof gallons. The following table provides 
examples of required minimum bond amounts:

             Annual Production and Receipts in Proof Gallons

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Large plants. A proprietor that operates a large plant that 
produces and receives more than 500,000 but not more than 510,000 proof 
gallons of spirits per year must provide a bond with a penal sum of at 
least $52,000.00. The proprietor must increase the penal sum of the bond 
by $2,000 for each additional 10,000 gallons, or fraction of 10,000 
gallons (over 510,000 gallons) that will be produced and received. The 
maximum bond for a large plant is $200,000.00. The following table 
provides examples of required minimum bond amounts:

which may affect labeling of articles, as described in this section.
    (b) Consumer Product Safety Commission. The Consumer Product Safety 
Commission has promulgated regulations to administer the Federal 
Hazardous Substances Act. The regulations in 16 CFR Chapter II require 
warning labels for products containing certain specified substances. For 
example, S.D.A. Formula Nos. 3-A and 30 require warning labels because 
they contain methyl alcohol, a hazardous substance at levels of 4% or 
more by weight. Manufacturers, reprocessors, rebottlers, and repackagers 
who convey articles containing strong chemicals should refer to 16 CFR 
Chapter II for warning label requirements.
    (c) Federal Trade Commission. The Federal Trade Commission (F.T.C.) 
has promulgated regulations to administer the Fair Packaging and 
Labeling Act. The regulations in 16 CFR Chapter I affect packaging and 
labeling of ``consumer commodities.'' The term ``consumer commodities'' 
generally means products intended for retail sale to an individual for 
personal or household use. The F.T.C. regulations do not apply to drugs, 
medical devices, or cosmetics for which the Food and Drug Administration 
enforces the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (see paragraph (d) of this 
section). Manufacturers, reprocessors, rebottlers, and repackagers who 
convey articles which are ``consumer commodities'' should refer to 16 
CFR Chapter I for packaging and labeling requirements.
    (d) Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health and Human 
Services. The Food and Drug Administration has promulgated regulations 
in 21 CFR Chapter I to administer the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act 
(as it applies to drugs, medical devices, or cosmetics) and the Federal 
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Manufacturers, reprocessors, rebottlers, 
and repackagers who convey articles which are drugs, medical devices, or 
cosmetics should refer to 21 CFR Chapter I for packaging and labeling 
requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 20.137  Penalties.

    Violation of the requirements prescribed in Sec. 20.132 is 
punishable by a fine of not more than $10,000 and/or imprisonment for 
not more than 5 years for each offense. In addition, persons who 
manufacture (including reprocess), sell, or transport articles in 
violation of this part are liable for payment of a tax on the articles 
at the rate imposed by law on distilled spirits.

    Completely denatured alcohol may be packaged by distributors in 
unlabeled containers which are completely encased in wood, fiberboard, 
or similar material so that the surface (including the opening) of the 
actual container is not exposed. When completely denatured spirits are 
packaged in unlabeled containers, the distributor shall apply the 
required marks or label to an exposed surface of the case. The case 
shall be so constructed that the portion containing the marks will be 
securely attached to the encased container until all of the contents 
have been removed. A statement reading ``Do Not Remove Inner Container 
Until Emptied,'' or words of similar meaning, shall be placed on the 
portion of the case bearing the marks.


<R05>

which applied.
    (d) Packages may also be marked with the brand name and a statement 
to the type of merchandise contained in the package if these markings do 
not obscure or detract from the required markings. The person filling 
the packages shall maintain the record required by Sec. 20.261.


<R05>
Sec. 20.147  Labels on consumer-size containers.

    (a) Each consumer-size container with a capacity of 5 gallons or 
less of completely denatured alcohol sold or offered for sale by a 
distributor shall bear a label showing, in plain, legible letters, the 
following:
    (1) The words ``Completely Denatured Alcohol'';

law) may be shown on the label without the appropriate TTB officer's 
approval. The

[[Page 533]]

word ``pure'', qualifying denatured alcohol may not appear on the label 
or the container.
    (c) The requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply 
to any person who sells completely denatured alcohol at wholesale or 
retail.


<R05>

                  Dealer Registration and Recordkeeping


<R05>
Sec. 24.50  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 24.51  Definitions.

    For purposes of Sec. Sec. 24.52 through 24.54 of this part, the 
following terms have the meanings indicated:
    Dealer. A person who sells, or offers for sale, any alcohol product 
(distilled

[[Page 609]]

spirits, wines, and/or beer) fit for beverage use.
    Retail dealer in liquors. A dealer who sells, or offers for sale, 
distilled spirits, wines, or beer to any person other than a dealer.
    Wholesale dealer in liquors. A dealer who sells, or offers for sale, 
distilled spirits, wines, or beer to another dealer.

[T.D. TTB-79, 74 FR 37404, July 28, 2009]


<R05>
Sec. 24.52  Dealer registration.

    Every proprietor who sells or offers for sale any alcohol product 
(distilled spirits, wines, or beer) fit for beverage use must register 
as a dealer in accordance with part 31 of this chapter. However, the 
proprietor's application to establish and operate a bonded wine premises 
or taxpaid wine bottling house filed under subpart D of this part, and 
approval of that application by the appropriate TTB officer, will 
constitute the proprietor's registration as a dealer at the approved 
bonded or taxpaid wine premises. Every proprietor registered as a dealer 
under this section will be classified as a wholesale dealer in liquors 
(see Sec. 31.32 of this chapter) and as such may also operate as a 
retail dealer in liquors without additional registration. Registration 
covers all sales from the same location, including sales of spirits, 
beer, or other proprietors' wine. As provided in Sec. 31.52 of this 
chapter, the proprietor is subject to no additional registration for 
making sales of wine or beer at the customer's place of business. 
Otherwise, a proprietor who conducts business as a dealer at a location 
other than the bonded wine premises or taxpaid wine bottling house must 
register and keep records in accordance with part 31 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 24.53  Amending the dealer registration.

    Every proprietor registered as a dealer under Sec. 24.52 must 
maintain a current and accurate application file under subpart D of this 
part. Whenever there is a change to any of the information provided in 
the proprietor's approved application, the proprietor must amend the 
application within the time period specified in subpart D of this part. 
An amendment of the proprietor's wine premises approved application will 
also amend the proprietor's dealer registration under Sec. 24.52. The 
proprietor's dealer registration will also terminate when wine 
operations authorized under this part terminate.

<R05>
Sec. 24.54  Dealer records.

    Every dealer is required to maintain records of transactions. Wine 
transactions that appear in the records required by subpart O of this 
part will meet the proprietor's recordkeeping requirements as a dealer. 
For other transactions not covered in the wine premises records, such as 
retail sales of distilled spirits or beer in a restaurant at the wine 
premises, or operations as a wholesale dealer in distilled spirits or 
beer, the proprietor must keep the records specified for dealers in part 
31 of this chapter.

Sec. 24.62  Notice.

    If an investigation or an examination of records discloses that 
liability for the tax on wine or distilled spirits, or special 
(occupational) tax has been incurred by the proprietor, the appropriate

amount of the proposed assessment in order to afford the proprietor an 
opportunity to submit a protest, with supporting evidence, within 45 
days, or to request a conference with regard to the tax liability. 
However, if collection of the tax liability may be jeopardized by a 
delay, the appropriate TTB officer may take immediate jeopardy 
assessment action pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6861.

Sec. 24.85  Essences.

    Essences or extracts (preparations of natural constituents extracted 
from fruit, herbs, berries, etc.) may be used in the production of any 
formula wine except agricultural wine. The essences may be produced on 
wine premises or elsewhere. Where an essence contains spirits, use of

Sec. 24.86  Essences produced on wine premises.

    Wine, taxpaid spirits, or spirits withdrawn tax-free may be used in 
the production of essences on wine premises. The description of the 
process for producing the essence may be included as part of a formula 
for the production of a formula wine or a separate formula may be filed 
on TTB F5120.29. If a separate formula is filed for the essence, the 
serial number of the formula by which it is produced will be shown in 
the TTB F 5120.29 covering the formula wine in which it is to be used. 
If an essence is to be made in quantities greater than required for 
individual lots of formula wine, and stored on the premises, a separate 
formula will be filed for the essence. Essences made on wine premises 
with wine spirits withdrawn free of tax pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 5214(a)(5) 
may only be used in the production of a formula wine, and may not be 
removed from the premises where made. Essences made on wine premises 
with the use of tax-free spirits withdrawn free of tax pursuant to 26 
U.S.C. 5214(a)(13) may only be used in the production of a nonbeverage 
wine or wine product and may not be removed from the premises where 
made. The TTB F 5120.29 for the production of an essence is filed in the 
same manner as for the production of formula wine and a sample of the 
essence produced will be at least four fluid ounces.

approval from the appropriate TTB officer. The request for approval will 
identify the essence by name or number and by the name of the 
manufacturer, and a sample of at least four fluid ounces of the essence 
will be submitted. However, a

[[Page 616]]

request for approval and submission of a sample is not required if the 
essence is made pursuant to approval of a formula on TTB F 5530.5, 
Formula and Process for Nonbeverage Product. Essences made under an 
approved formula on TTB F 5530.5 will be described on TTB F 5120.29 by

Sec. 24.135  Wine premises alternation.

    (a) General. The proprietor of a bonded winery or bonded wine cellar 
may alternate all or a portion of wine premises for use as a taxpaid 
wine bottling house or use as taxpaid wine premises. The proprietor may 
also alternate the use of adjacent or contiguous premises qualified 
under 26 U.S.C. chapter 51 (distilled spirits plant, brewery, etc.) for 
use as wine premises or vice versa. If a proprietor of a bonded wine 
cellar or winery wishes to use all or a portion of such premises 
alternately as a volatile fruit-flavor concentrate plant or vice-a-
versa, the proprietor must comply with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 
18.40 through 18.43 of this title.
    (b) Qualifying documents. Where the proprietor desires to alternate 
bonded wine premises as taxpaid wine bottling house premises or taxpaid 
wine premises, or other premises qualified under

[[Page 626]]

26 U.S.C. chapter 51, the following qualifying documents will be filed:
    (1) A statement on the application TTB F 5120.25 that an alternation 
of wine premises will occur;
    (2) Evidence of existing bond, consent of surety, or a new bond 
covering the alternation;
    (3) A description of how taxpaid wine or spirits, or untaxpaid wine 
or spirits will be identified and segregated; and
    (4) Any other document or additional information the appropriate TTB 
officer may require.
    (c) Alternation. After the necessary qualifying documents have been 
approved by the appropriate TTB officer, the proprietor may alternate 
wine premises as described in the application. Any portion of wine 
premises on which taxpaid wine is located will be considered taxpaid 
wine premises or taxpaid wine bottling house premises and any portion of 
the premises on which wine not identified as taxpaid is located will be 
considered bonded wine premises. The proprietor shall, prior to the 
initial alternation of the premises, identify by portable signs or tags, 
or by any other method or manner satisfactory to the appropriate TTB 
officer, either all taxpaid wine on taxpaid wine premises or taxpaid 
wine bottling house premises or all untaxpaid wine on bonded wine 
premises.
    (d) Segregation. The proprietor shall keep untaxpaid wine or spirits 
physically separated from taxpaid wine or spirits and on the designated 
premises. This separation will be by use of tanks, rooms, buildings, 
partitions, pallet stacks, or complete physical separation, or by any 
other method or manner which will clearly and readily distinguish 
untaxpaid wine or spirits from taxpaid wine or spirits and is 
satisfactory to the appropriate TTB officer. Where necessary for the 
protection of the revenue or enforcement of 26 U.S.C. chapter 51, the 
appropriate TTB officer may require that the portions of wine premises 
alternated under this section be separated by partitions or otherwise.
    (e) Conditions. Authority for the alternation of bonded wine 
premises, taxpaid wine bottling house premises, taxpaid wine premises, 
or other premises qualified under 26 U.S.C chapter 51 is conditioned on 
compliance by the proprietor with the provisions of this section. 
Authority for the alternation of bonded wine premises, taxpaid wine 
bottling house premises, taxpaid wine premises, or other premises 
qualified under 26 U.S.C. chapter 51 may be withdrawn whenever in the 
judgment of the appropriate TTB officer the revenue is jeopardized or 
the effective administration of this part is hindered by the 
continuation of the authorization.

Sec. 24.136  Procedure for alternating proprietors.

    (a) General. Wine premises, or parts thereof, may be operated 
alternately by proprietors who have each filed and received approval of 
the necessary applications and bonds and have qualified under the 
provisions of this part. Where operations by alternating proprietors are 
limited to parts of the wine premises, the application will describe 
areas, buildings, floors, or rooms which will be alternated and will be 
accompanied by a diagram delineating the parts of the wine premises to 
be alternated. A separate diagram will be submitted to depict each 
arrangement under which the wine premises will be operated. Once the 
qualifying documents have been approved, and operations initiated, the 
wine premises, or parts thereof, may be alternated. Any transfer of 
wine, spirits, or other accountable materials from one proprietor to the 
other proprietor will be indicated in the records and reports of each 
proprietor. Operation of a bonded winery engaged in the production of 
wine by an alternate proprietor will be at least one calendar day in 
length.
    (b) Alternation. All operations in any area, building, floor, or 
room to be alternated will be completely finished and all wine, spirits, 
and other accountable materials will be removed from the alternated wine 
premises or transferred to the incoming proprietor.

[[Page 627]]

However, wine, spirits, and other accountable materials may be retained

Sec. 24.176  Crushing and fermentation.

    (a) Natural wine production. Water may be used to flush equipment 
during the crushing process or to facilitate fermentation but the 
density of the juice may not be reduced below 22 degrees Brix. However, 
if the juice is already less than 23 degrees Brix, the use of water to 
flush equipment or facilitate fermentation is limited to a juice density 
reduction of no more than one degree Brix. At the start of fermentation 
no material may be added except water, sugar, concentrated fruit juice 
from the same kind of fruit, malo-lactic bacteria, yeast or yeast 
cultures grown in juice of the same kind of fruit, and yeast foods, 
sterilizing agents, precipitating agents or other approved fermentation 
adjuncts. Water may be used to rehydrate yeast to a maximum to two 
gallons of water for each pound of yeast; however, except for an 
operation involving the preparation of a yeast culture starter and must 
mixture for later use in initiating fermentation, the maximum volume 
increase of the juice after the addition of rehydrated yeast is limited 
to 0.5 percent. After fermentation natural wines may be blended with 
each other only if produced from the same kind of fruit.
    (b) Determination of wine produced. Upon completion of fermentation 
or removal from the fermenter, the volume of wine will be accurately 
determined,

Sec. 24.177  Chaptalization (Brix adjustment).

    In producing natural grape wine from juice having a low sugar 
content, pure dry sugar or concentrated grape juice may be added before 
or during fermentation to develop alcohol. In producing natural fruit 
wine from juice having a low sugar content, sugar, or concentrated juice 
of the same kind of fruit may be added before or during fermentation to 
develop alcohol. The quantity of sugar or concentrated juice added may 
not raise the original density of the juice above 25 degrees Brix. If 
grape juice or grape wine is ameliorated after chaptalization, the 
quantity of pure dry sugar added to juice for chaptalization will be 
included as ameliorating material. If fruit juice or fruit wine is 
ameliorated after chaptalization, pure dry sugar added under this 
section is not considered as ameliorating material. However, if fruit 
juice or fruit wine is ameliorated after chaptalization and liquid sugar 
or invert sugar syrup is used to chaptalize the fruit juice, the volume 
of water contained in the liquid sugar or invert sugar syrup will be 
included as ameliorating material.

Sec. 24.178  Amelioration.

    (a) General. In producing natural wine from juice having a fixed 
acid level exceeding 5.0 grams per liter, the winemaker may adjust the 
fixed acid level by adding ameliorating material (water, sugar, or a 
combination of both) before, during and after fermentation. The fixed 
acid level of the juice is determined prior to fermentation and is 
calculated as tartaric acid for grapes, malic acid for apples, and 
citric acid for other fruit. Each 20 gallons of ameliorating material 
added to 1,000 gallons of juice or wine will reduce the fixed acid level 
of the juice or wine by 0.1 gram per liter (the fixed acid level of the 
juice or wine may not be less than 5.0 gram per liter after the addition 
of ameliorating material).
    (b) Limitations. (1) Amelioration is permitted only at the bonded 
wine premises where the natural wine is produced.
    (2) The ameliorating material added to juice or wine may not reduce 
the fixed acid level of the ameliorated juice or wine to less than 5.0 
grams per liter.
    (3) For all wine, except for wine described in paragraph (b)(4) of 
this section, the volume of ameliorating material added to juice or wine 
may not exceed 35 percent of the total volume of ameliorated juice or 
wine (calculated exclusive of pulp). Where the starting fixed acid level 
is or exceeds 7.69 grams per liter, a maximum of 538.4 gallons of 
ameliorating material may be added to each 1,000 gallons of wine or 
juice.
    (4) For wine produced from any fruit (excluding grapes) or berry 
with a natural fixed acid of 20 parts per thousand or more (before any 
correction of such fruit or berry), the volume of ameliorating material 
added to juice or wine may not exceed 60 percent of the total volume of 
ameliorated juice or wine (calculated exclusive of pulp). If the 
starting fixed acid level is or exceeds 12.5 grams per liter, a maximum 
of 1,500 gallons of ameliorating material may be added to each 1,000 
gallons of wine or juice.

<R05>
Sec. 24.179  Sweetening.

    (a) General. In producing natural wine, sugar, juice or concentrated 
fruit juice of the same kind of fruit may be added after fermentation to 
sweeten wine. When juice or concentrated fruit juice is added, the 
solids content of the finished wine may not exceed 21 percent by weight. 
When liquid sugar or

[[Page 637]]

invert sugar syrup is used, the resulting volume may not exceed the 
volume which would result from the maximum use of pure dry sugar only.
    (b) Grape wine. Any natural grape wine of a winemaker's own 
production may have sugar added after amelioration and fermentation 
provided the finished wine does not exceed 17 percent total solids by 
weight if the alcohol content is more than 14 percent by volume or 21 
percent total solids by weight if the alcohol content is not more than 
14 percent by volume.
    (c) Fruit wine. Any natural fruit wine of a winemaker's own 
production may have sugar added after amelioration and fermentation 
provided the finished wine does not exceed 21 percent total solids by 
weight and the alcohol content is not more than 14 percent by volume.
    (d) Specially sweetened natural wine. Specially sweetened natural 
wine is produced by adding to natural wine of the winemaker's own 
production sufficient pure dry sugar, juice or concentrated fruit juice 
of the same kind of fruit, separately or in combination, so that the 
finished product has a total solids content between 17 percent and 35 
percent by weight, and an alcohol content of not more than 14 percent by 
volume. Natural wine containing added wine spirits may be used in the 
production of specially sweetened natural wine; however, wine spirits 
may not be added to specially sweetened natural wine. Specially 
sweetened natural wines may be blended with each other, or with natural 
wine or heavy bodied blending wine (including juice or concentrated 
fruit juice to which wine spirits have been added), in the further 
production of specially sweetened natural wine only if the wines (or 
juice) so blended are made from the same kind of fruit.

Sec. 24.180  Use of concentrated and unconcentrated fruit juice.

    Concentrated fruit juice reduced with water to its original density, 
or to 22 degrees Brix, or to any degree of Brix between its original 
density and 22 degrees Brix, and unconcentrated fruit juice reduced with 
water to not less than 22 degrees Brix, is considered juice for the 
purpose of standard wine production. Concentrated fruit juice reduced 
with water to any degree of Brix greater than 22 degrees Brix may be 
further reduced with water to any degree of Brix between its original 
density and 22 degrees Brix. The proprietor, prior to using concentrated 
fruit juice in wine production, shall obtain a statement in which the 
producer certifies the kind of fruit from which it was produced and the 
total solids content of the juice before and after concentration. 
Concentrated or unconcentrated fruit juice may be used in juice or wine 
made from the same kind of fruit for the purposes of chaptalizing or 
sweetening, as provided in this part. Concentrated fruit juice, or juice 
which has been concentrated and reconstituted, may not be used in 
standard wine production if at any time it was concentrated to more than 
80 degrees Brix.

Sec. 24.182  Use of acid to correct natural deficiencies.

    (a) General. Acids of the kinds occurring in grapes or other fruit 
(including berries) may be added within the limitations of Sec. 24.246 
to juice or wine in order to correct natural deficiencies; however, no 
acid may be added to juice or wine which is ameliorated to correct 
natural deficiencies except that in the production of grape wine, 
tartaric acid may be used to reduce the pH of the juice or wine. If 
tartaric acid is used to correct the pH of grape juice or wine, the 
fixed acid level of the juice shall be measured prior to the addition of 
any tartaric acid to determine the maximum quantity of ameliorating 
material allowed. In addition, when using tartaric acid to reduce the pH 
of ameliorated grape juice or wine, the pH cannot be reduced below 3.0.
    (b) Grape wine. Tartaric acid or malic acid, or a combination of 
tartaric acid and malic acid, may be added prior to or during 
fermentation, to grapes or juice from grapes. In addition, after 
fermentation is completed, citric acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, lactic 
acid or tartaric acid, or a combination of two or more of these acids, 
may be added to correct natural deficiencies. However, the use of these 
acids, either prior to, during or after fermentation, may not increase 
the fixed acid level of the finished wine (calculated as tartaric acid) 
above 9.0 grams per liter. In cases where the wine contains 8.0 or more 
grams of total solids per 100 milliliters of wine, acids may be added to 
the extent that the finished wine does not contain more than 11.0 grams 
per liter of fixed acid (calculated as tartaric acid).
    (c) Fruit wine. Only citric acid may be added to citrus fruit, juice 
or wine, only malic acid may be added to apples, apple juice or wine, 
and only citric acid or malic acid may be added to other fruit 
(including berries) or to juice or wine derived from other fruit 
(including berries) to correct natural deficiencies to 9.0 grams per 
liter of finished wine; however, if the wine contains 8.0 or more grams 
of total solids per 100 milliliters of wine, acids may be added to 
correct natural deficiencies to the extent that the finished wine does 
not contain more than 11.0 grams per liter of fixed acid (calculated as

                Subpart G_Production of Effervescent Wine


<R05>
Sec. 24.190  General.

    Effervescent wine may be made on bonded wine premises. Where the 
effervescence results from fermentation of the wine within a closed 
container, the wine is classed and taxed as sparkling wine. The use of 
carbon dioxide, nitrogen gas, or a combination of both, is permitted to 
maintain counterpressure during the transfer and bottling of sparkling 
wine. Wine carbonated by injection of carbon dioxide is classed and 
taxed as artificially carbonated wine. Sparkling wine, artificially 
carbonated wine, and any wine used as a base in the production of 
sparkling wine or artificially carbonated wine, may not have an alcohol 
content in excess of 14 percent by volume. However, wine containing more 
than 14 percent of alcohol by volume may be used in preparing a dosage 
for finishing sparkling wine or artificially carbonated wine.

Sec. 24.192  Process and materials.

    In preparing still wine for the production of sparkling wine or 
artificially carbonated wine, sugar and acid of the kinds and within the 
limitations prescribed in Sec. 24.182 may be added with yeast or yeast 
culture to acclimate the yeast and to facilitate the process of 
secondary fermentation or to correct the wine. Fruit syrup, sugar, wine, 
wine spirits, and acid may be used in preparing a finishing dosage for 
sparkling wine or artificially carbonated wine provided the dosage does 
not exceed 10 percent by volume of the finished product. Where the 
proprietor desires to use more than 10 percent by volume finishing 
dosage, the proprietor shall file for a formula approval under Sec. 
24.80. The fruit syrup, wine spirits and wine used will come from the 
same kind of fruit as the wine from which the sparkling wine or 
artificially carbonated wine is made. In the production of sparkling 
wine or artificially carbonated wine, taxpaid wine spirits or wine 
spirits withdrawn tax-free may be used. Tax-free wine spirits may only 
be used in the production of sparkling wine or artificially carbonated 
wine

[[Page 640]]

              Subpart H_Production of Special Natural Wine


<R05>
Sec. 24.195  General.

    Special natural wine is a flavored wine made on bonded wine premises 
from a base of natural wine. The flavoring added may include natural 
herbs, spices, fruit juices, natural aromatics, natural essences or 
other natural flavoring, in quantities or proportions such that the 
resulting product derives character and flavor distinctive from the base 
wine and distinguishable from other natural wine. Fruit juices may not 
be used to give to one natural wine the flavor of another but may be 
used with herbs or spices to produce a wine having a distinctive flavor. 
Caramel and sugar may be used in a special natural wine. However, the 
minimum 60 degrees Brix limitations prescribed in the definition of 
``Liquid pure sugar'' and ``Invert sugar syrup'' in Sec. 24.10 do not 
apply to materials used in the manufacture of vermouth. Finished 
vermouth will contain a minimum of 80 percent by volume natural wine. 
Heavy bodied blending wine and juice or concentrated fruit juice to 
which wine spirits have been added may be used in the production of 
special natural wine pursuant to formula approval.

    Agricultural wine may be produced on bonded wine premises from 
suitable agricultural products other than the juice of fruit. Water or 
sugar, or both, may be used within the limitations of this subpart in 
the production of agricultural wine. Agricultural wine may not be 
flavored or colored; however, hops may be used in the production of 
honey wine. Spirits may not be used in the production of the wine and a 
wine made from one agricultural product may not be blended with a wine 
made from another agricultural product. Agricultural wine made with 
sugar in excess of the limitations of this subpart is other than 
standard wine and will be segregated and clearly identified. Since 
grain, cereal, malt, or molasses are not suitable materials for the 
production of agricultural wine, these materials may not be received on 
bonded wine premises. Beverage alcohol products made with these 
materials are not classed as wine and may not be produced or stored on 
bonded wine premises.

Sec. 24.202  Dried fruit.

    In the production of wine from dried fruit, a quantity of water 
sufficient to restore the moisture content to that of the fresh fruit 
may be added. If it is desired not to restore the moisture content of 
the dried fruit to that of the fresh fruit, or if the moisture content 
is not known, sufficient water may be added to reduce the density to 22 
degrees Brix. If the dried fruit liquid after restoration is found to be 
deficient in sugar, sufficient pure dry sugar may be added to increase 
the total solids content to 25 degrees Brix. After addition of water to 
the dried fruit, the resulting liquid may be ameliorated with either 
water or sugar, or both, in such total volume as may be necessary to 
reduce the natural fixed acid level of the mixture to a minimum of 5.0 
grams per liter; however, in no event may the volume of the ameliorating 
material exceed 35 percent of the total volume of the ameliorated juice 
or wine (calculated exclusive of pulp). Pure dry sugar may be used for 
sweetening. After complete fermentation or complete fermentation and 
sweetening, the finished product may not have a total solids content 
that exceeds 35 degrees Brix.

milliliters of wine. However, a tolerance of not more than 0.009 grams 
per 100 milliliters to the maximum limitation of carbon dioxide in still 
wine will be allowed where the amount of carbon dioxide in excess of 
0.392 grams per 100 milliliters is due to mechanical variations which 
can not be completely controlled under good commercial practice. A 
tolerance will not be allowed where it is found that the proprietor 
continuously or intentionally exceeds 0.392 grams of carbon dioxide per 
100 milliliters of wine or where the variation results from the use of 
methods or equipment determined by the appropriate TTB officer not in 
accordance with good commercial practice. The proprietor shall determine 
the amount of carbon dioxide added to wine using authorized test 
procedures. Penalties are provided in 26 U.S.C. 5662 for any person who,

                 Bottling, Packing, and Labeling of Wine


<R05>
Sec. 24.255  Bottling or packing wine.

    (a) General. Proprietors of a bonded wine premises and a taxpaid 
wine bottling house premises shall be held strictly responsible for the 
correct determination of the quantity and alcohol content of wine 
removed. As required by Sec. 24.170, appropriate and accurate measures 
and instruments for measuring and testing the wine will be provided at 
each wine premises.
    (b) Bottle or other container fill. Proprietors of bonded wine 
premises and taxpaid wine bottling house premises shall fill bottles or 
other containers as nearly as possible to conform to the amount shown on 
the label or blown in the bottle or marked on any container other than a 
bottle; but in no event may the amount of wine contained in any 
individual bottle, due to lack of uniformity of the bottles, vary from 
the amount stated more than 1.0 percent for 15.0 liters and above, 1.5 
percent for 1.0 liter to 14.9 liters, 2.0 percent for 750 mL, 3.0 
percent for 375 mL, 4.5 percent for 187 mL and 100 mL, and 9.0 percent 
for 50 mL; and in such case, there will be substantially as many bottles 
overfilled as there are bottles underfilled for each lot of wine 
bottled. Short-filled bottles or other containers of wine which are sold 
or otherwise disposed of by the proprietor to employees for personal 
consumption need not be labeled, but, if labeled, need not show an 
accurate statement of net contents.
    (c) Tax tolerance. The net contents of bottles or other containers 
of untaxpaid wine in the same tax class filled during six consecutive 
tax return periods, as determined from the bonded wine premises 
proprietor's fill test records, shall not vary by more than 0.5 percent 
from the net contents as stated on the bottles or other containers. The 
bonded wine premises proprietor is liable for the tax on the entire 
amount of wine in the same tax class when that wine is removed from 
bond, without benefit of tolerance, when the fill of bottles or other 
containers exceeds a 0.5 percent average of a period which consists of 
six consecutive tax returns, or when filling is not conducted in 
compliance with good commercial practice.
    (d) Fill tests. The proprietor shall test at representative 
intervals wine bottled or packed during the bottling or packing 
operation of each bottling or packing line to determine if the wine 
contained in the bottle or other container is in agreement with that 
stated on the label, bottle, or other container.
    (e) Alcohol tests. The proprietor shall test the alcohol content by 
volume to determine the tax class of the wine and to ensure the alcohol 
content to be stated on the label is in agreement with the requirement 
of Sec. 24.257.

Sec. 24.256  Bottle aging wine.

    Wine bottled or packed and stored for the purpose of aging need not 
have labels affixed until the wine is removed for consumption or sale. 
However, the bins, pallets, stacks, cases or containers of unlabeled 
wine will be marked in some manner to show the kind (class and type) and 
alcohol content of the wine. If the unlabeled wine is stored at a 
location other than the

[[Page 658]]

bottling or packing winery, the registry number of the bottling or 
packing winery will also be shown.

<R05>
Sec. 24.257  Labeling wine containers.

    (a) The proprietor must label each bottle or other container of 
beverage wine prior to removal for consumption or sale. The minimum type 
size for information required by this section is: 2 millimeters for 
containers of more than 187 milliliters and 1 millimeter for containers 
of 187 milliliters or less. The maximum type size for alcohol content 
statements is 3 millimeters unless the container is larger than 5 
liters. The label must be securely affixed and show:
    (1) The name and address of the wine premises where bottled or 
packed;
    (2) The brand name, if different from above;
    (3) The alcohol content as percent by volume or the alcohol content 
stated in accordance with 27 CFR part 4. For wine with less than 7 
percent alcohol by volume stated on the label there is allowed an 
alcohol content tolerance of plus or minus .75 percent by volume; and
    (4) The kind of wine, shown as follows:
    (i) If the wine contains 7 percent or more alcohol by volume and 
must have label approval under 27 CFR part 4, the kind of wine is the 
class, type, or other designation provided in that part.
    (ii) If the wine has an exemption from label approval, an adequate 
statement of composition may be used instead of the class and type in 27 
CFR part 4.
    (iii) If the wine contains less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, an 
adequate statement of composition may be used instead of the class and 
type in 27 CFR part 4. The rules in 27 CFR part 4 pertaining to label 
approval and standards of fill do not apply to wine under 7 percent 
alcohol by volume. The rules in 27 CFR part 16 requiring a Health 
Warning Statement do apply to all wines over 1/2 percent alcohol. Except 
for the rules noted in this section, labeling of wines under 7 percent 
alcohol is under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration.
    (iv) The statement of composition must include enough information to 
identify the tax class when viewed with the alcohol content. First, the 
wine should be identified by the word ``wine,'' ``mead,'' ``cider'' or 
``perry,'' as applicable. If the wine contains more than 0.392 grams of 
carbon dioxide per 100 milliliters, the word ``sparkling'' or 
``carbonated,'' as applicable, must be included in the statement of 
composition. If the statement of composition leaves doubt as to the tax 
class of the wine, the wine must be marked ``tax class 5041(b)(1) IRC'' 
or an equivalent phrase. For example, a still wine marked ``wine'' and 
``16 percent alcohol by volume'' is adequately marked to identify its 
tax class as 5041(b)(2). A still wine marked ``hard cider'' and ``9 
percent alcohol by volume'' is adequately marked to identify its tax 
class as 5041(b)(1). A still wine marked ``raspberry hard cider'' and 
``9 percent alcohol by volume'' is adequately marked to identify its tax 
class as 5041(b)(1). A still wine eligible for the hard cider tax rate 
marked ``cider'' or ``hard cider'' and ``6 percent alcohol by volume'' 
is adequately marked to identify its tax class as 5041(b)(6). However, 
if a still wine that is not eligible for the hard cider tax rate is 
marked ``cider'' or ``hard cider'' and ``6 percent alcohol by volume'' 
it is not adequately marked to identify its tax class as 5041(b)(1), so 
the tax class must be shown.
    (5) The net content of the container unless the net content is 
permanently marked on the container as provided in 27 CFR part 4.
    (b) The information shown on any label applied to bottled or packed 
wine is subject to the recordkeeping requirements of Sec. 24.314. (Sec. 
201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1381, as amended, 1407, as amended (26 
U.S.C. 5368, 5388, 5662))
    (c) Use of semi-generic designations--(1) In general. Semi-generic 
designations may be used to designate wines of an origin other than that 
indicated by such name only if--
    (i) There appears in direct conjunction therewith an appropriate 
appellation of origin, as defined in part 4 of

[[Page 659]]

this chapter, disclosing the true place of origin of the wine, and
    (ii) The wine so designated conforms to the standard of identity, if 
any, for such wine contained in part 4 of this chapter or, if there is 
no such standard, to the trade understanding of such class or type.
    (2) Determination of whether a name is semi-generic--(i) In general. 
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, a name of 
geographic significance, which is also the designation of a class or 
type of wine, shall be deemed to have become semi-generic only if so 
found by the Administrator.
    (ii) Certain names treated as semi-generic. The following names 
shall be treated as semi-generic: Angelica, Burgundy, Claret, Chablis, 
Champagne, Chianti, Malaga, Marsala, Madeira, Moselle, Port, Rhine Wine 
or Hock, Sauterne, Haut Sauterne, Sherry, Tokay.

Sec. 24.259  Marks.

    (a) Required marks. Each container larger than four liters or each 
case used to remove wine for consumption or sale will be durably marked 
to show the following information:
    (1) The serial number or filling date as provided in Sec. 24.260;
    (2) The name (or trade name) and the registry number of the bottlers 
wine premises;
    (3) The kind (class and type) and the alcohol content of the wine. 
The kind of wine and alcohol content will be stated in accordance with 
Sec. 24.257. The formula number will be marked on bulk containers of 
special natural wine or other wine produced under Sec. 24.218;
    (4) The net contents of each container larger than four liters or 
each case in wine gallons, or for containers larger than four liters or 
cases filled according to metric measure, the contents in liters. If 
wine is removed in cases, the cases may be marked to show the number and 
size of bottles or other containers in each case in lieu of the net 
contents of the case; and
    (5) Except for cases, the date of removal or shipment.
    (b) Application of marks. Required marks may be cut, printed, or 
otherwise legibly and durably marked upon the container larger than four 
liters or the case or placed on a label or tag securely affixed to the 
case or container larger than four liters.
    (c) Location of marks. Required marks will be placed on a container 
larger than four liters or on the side of a case for ready examination 
by appropriate TTB officers.

Sec. 24.260  Serial numbers or filling date.

    Each container larger than four liters or each case used for 
removing wine for consumption or sale will be marked with a serial 
number or filling date at the time of filling or when such containers or 
cases are prepared for removal. Serial numbers will commence with ``1'' 
and continue until the numeral ``1,000,000'' is reached, whereupon the 
series may recommence with the numeral ``1.'' However, the proprietor 
may initiate a new series after the numeral ``1,000,000'' has been 
reached provided no numeral will be used more than once during a 12-
month period. If desired, a separate series of numbers with letter 
prefixes may be used for containers larger than four liters and for 
cases, or for cases filled on different bottling lines, or for removals 
from different loading docks. The proprietor may mark containers larger 
than four

[[Page 660]]

liters or the cases with the filling date in lieu of using a serial 
number or use both a serial number and the filling date. However, if the 
proprietor desires to change from the use of a serial number to use of a 
filling date, or vice versa, a notice will be sent to the appropriate 
TTB officer before making the change. Where United States or foreign 
wine is recased, the cases will be marked with the date of recasing, 
preceded by the letter ``R'', in lieu of serial number or filling date.

Sec. 24.265  Losses by theft.

    The proprietor shall be liable for and pay the tax on wine 
unlawfully removed while on bonded wine premises, or while in transit 
thereto or therefrom in bond, unless the proprietor or other person 
responsible for the tax, establishes to the satisfaction of the 
appropriate TTB officer that the theft did not occur as the result of 
connivance, collusion, fraud or negligence on the part of the proprietor 
or other person responsible for the tax or the owner, consignor, 
consignee, bailee, or carrier, or their agents or employees.

<R05>
Sec. 24.266  Inventory losses.

    (a) General. The proprietor shall take a physical inventory of all 
untaxpaid wine on-hand on bonded wine premises as of the close of 
business each tax year, or where a cycle different from the tax year has 
been established as provided in Sec. 24.313, the inventory will be 
taken annually at the end of that cycle, or at any time required by an 
appropriate TTB officer. The physical inventory of bulk and bottled or 
packed wine will be recorded and reported as required by Sec. 24.313.
    (b) Bulk wine losses. The physical inventory of bulk wine will 
determine losses due to spillage, leakage, soakage, evaporation, and 
other losses normally occurring from racking and filtering since the 
previous physical inventory required by this section. A claim for 
allowance of loss, under the provisions of Sec. 24.65, is required for 
inventory losses in production or storage:
    (1) Where there are circumstances indicating that all or a part of 
the wine reported lost was unlawfully removed, or
    (2) Where the loss on bonded wine premises during the annual period 
exceeds three percent of the aggregate volume of wine on-hand at the 
beginning of the annual period and the volume of wine received in bond 
during the annual period; or the loss exceeds six percent of the still 
wine produced by fermentation; or the loss exceeds six percent of the 
sparkling wine produced by fermentation in bottles; or the loss exceeds 
three percent of the special natural wine produced under Sec. 24.195 or 
other wine produced under Sec. 24.218; or the loss exceeds three 
percent of the artificially carbonated wine produced; or the loss 
exceeds three percent of the bulk process sparkling wine produced.

The percentage applicable to each tax class of wine will be calculated 
separately, unless the calculation is impracticable because of the 
mixture of different tax classes by addition of wine spirits or blending 
during the annual period, in which case the percentage will be 
calculated on the aggregate volume. Wine removed immediately after 
production for use as distilling material and on which the usual 
racking, clarifying, and filtering losses are not sustained, will not be 
included in the calculations.
    (c) Bottle and other container wine losses. Wine filled into a 
bottle or other similar containers are not subject to losses due to 
spillage, leakage, soakage, evaporation, and other losses normally 
occurring from racking and filtering. In addition, wine that has been 
filled into a bottle or other similar containers can be accurately 
accounted for and any unexplained shortage is

[[Page 661]]

considered evidence of an unreported removal. Therefore, the proprietor 
shall pay the tax on any unexplained loss of untaxpaid bottled or packed 
wine disclosed by inventory or otherwise.

<R05>
Sec. 24.270  Determination of tax.

    The tax on wine is determined at the time of removal from a bonded 
wine premises for consumption or sale. Section 5041 of title 26, United 
States Code, imposes an excise tax, at the rates prescribed, on all wine 
(including imitation, substandard, or artificial wine, and compounds 
sold as wine, which contain 24 percent or less of alcohol by volume) 
produced in or imported into the United States. Wine containing more 
that 24 percent of alcohol by volume is classed as distilled spirits and 
taxed accordingly. The tax is determined and paid on the volume of wine:
    (a) In bottles or other containers filled according to United States 
measure recorded to the nearest 10th gallon; or,
    (b) In bottles or other containers filled according to metric 
measure, on the volume of wine in United States wine gallons to the 
nearest 10th gallon; or
    (c) In the case of pipeline removals, on the volume of bulk wine 
removed recorded to the nearest whole gallon, five-tenths gallon being 
converted to the next full gallon.

<R05>
Sec. 24.271  Payment of tax by return with remittance.

    (a) General. The tax on wine is paid by an Excise Tax Return, TTB F 
5000.24, which is filled with remittance (check, cash, or money order) 
for the full amount of tax due. Prepayments of tax on wine during the 
period covered by the return are shown separately on the Excise Tax 
Return form. If no tax is due for the return period, the filing of a 
return is not required.
    (b) Return periods and due dates. --(1) Return periods. --(i) 
Semimonthly return

[[Page 662]]

period. Except in the case of a taxpayer who qualifies for, and chooses 
to use, the annual return period as provided in Sec. 24.273 or the 
quarterly return period as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this 
section, all taxpayers who have filed a bond for deferred payment of 
taxes must use semimonthly return periods. The semimonthly return 
periods run from the 1st day through the 15th day of each month, and 
from the 16th day through the last day of each month, except as 
otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (ii) Quarterly return period. A taxpayer who has filed a bond for 
deferred payment of taxes may choose to use a quarterly return period if 
the taxpayer was not liable for more than $50,000 in taxes with respect 
to wine imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5041 and 7652 in the preceding calendar 
year and if that taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for not more 
than $50,000 in such taxes during the current calendar year. In such a 
case the last day for paying the tax and filing the return shall be the 
14th day after the last day of the calendar quarter. However, the 
taxpayer may not use the quarterly return period procedure for any 
portion of the calendar year following the first date on which the 
aggregate amount of tax due from the taxpayer during the calendar year 
exceeds $50,000, and any tax that has not been paid on that date shall 
be due on the 14th day after the last day of the semimonthly period in 
which that date occurs. The following additional rules apply to the 
quarterly return period procedure under this section:
    (A) A ``taxpayer'' is an individual, corporation, partnership, or 
other entity that is assigned a single Employer Identification Number as 
defined in 26 CFR 301.7701-12;
    (B) ``Reasonably expects'' means that there is no existing or 
anticipated circumstance known to the taxpayer (such as an increase in 
production capacity) that would cause the taxpayer's tax liability to 
exceed the prescribed limit;
    (C) A taxpayer with multiple locations must combine the wine tax 
liability for all locations to determine eligibility for the quarterly 
return procedure;
    (D) A taxpayer who has both domestic operations and import 
transactions must combine the wine tax liability on the domestic 
operations and the imports to determine eligibility for the quarterly 
return procedure;
    (E) The controlled group rules of 26 U.S.C. 5061(e), which concern 
treatment of controlled groups as one taxpayer, do not apply for 
purposes of determining eligibility for the quarterly return procedure. 
However, a taxpayer who is eligible for the quarterly return procedure, 
and who is a member of a controlled group that owes $5 million or more 
in wine excise taxes per year, is required to pay taxes by electronic 
fund transfer (EFT). Quarterly payments via EFT shall be transmitted in 
accordance with section 5061(e);
    (F) A new taxpayer is eligible to file quarterly returns in the 
first year of business simply if the taxpayer reasonably expects to be 
liable for not more than $50,000 in wine taxes during that calendar 
year; and
    (G) If a taxpayer filing quarterly exceeds $50,000 in tax liability 
during a taxable year and therefore must revert to the semimonthly 
return procedure, that taxpayer may resume quarterly payments only after 
a full calendar year has passed during which the taxpayer's liability 
did not exceed $50,000.
    (2) Semimonthly and quarterly tax return due dates. The taxpayer 
shall file the semimonthly or quarterly return, with remittance, for 
each return period not later than the 14th day after the last day of the 
return period. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal 
holiday, the return and remittance are due on the immediately preceding 
day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, except as 
otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (c) Special September rule for taxes due by semimonthly return. --
(1) Division of second semimonthly period.-- (i) General. Except as 
otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the second 
semimonthly period for the month of September is divided into two 
payment periods, from the 16th day through the 26th day, and from the 
27th day through the 30th day. The proprietor shall file a return on TTB 
F 5000.24, and make remittance, for the

[[Page 663]]

period September 16-26, no later than September 29. The proprietor shall 
file a return on TTB F 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period 
September 27-30, no later than October 14.
    (ii) Taxpayment not by electronic fund transfer. In the case of 
taxes for which remittance by electronic fund transfer (EFT) is not 
required by Sec. 24.272, the second semimonthly period of September is 
divided into two payment periods, from the 16th day through the 25th 
day, and from the 26th day through the 30th day. The proprietor shall 
file a return on TTB F 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period 
September 16-25, no later than September 28. The proprietor shall file a 
return on TTB F 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 
26-30, no later than October 14.
    (2) Amount of payment--Safe harbor rule.-- (i) General. Taxpayers 
are considered to have met the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of 
this section if the amount paid no later than September 29 is not less 
than 11/15ths (73.3 percent) of the tax liability incurred for the 
semimonthly period beginning on September 1 and ending on September 15, 
and if any underpayment of tax is paid by October 14.
    (ii) Taxpayment not by EFT. Taxpayers are considered to have met the 
requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section if the amount paid 
no later than September 28 is not less than 2/3rds (66.7 percent) of the 
tax liability incurred for the semimonthly period beginning on September 
1 and ending on September 15, and if any underpayment of tax is paid by 
October 14.
    (3) Weekends and holidays. If the required taxpayment due date for 
the period September 16-25 or September 16-26, as applicable, falls on a 
Saturday or legal holiday, the return and remittance are due on the 
immediately preceding day. If the required due date falls on a Sunday, 
the return and remittance are due on the immediately following day.
    (4) Example: Payment of tax for the month of September.-- (i) Facts. 
X, a proprietor required to pay taxes by electronic fund transfer, 
incurred tax liability in the amount of $30,000 for the first 
semimonthly period of September. For the period September 16-26, X 
incurred tax liability in the amount of $45,000, and for the period 
September 27-30, X incurred tax liability in the amount of $2,000.
    (ii) Payment requirement. X's payment of tax in the amount of 
$30,000 for the first semimonthly period of September is due no later 
than September 29 (Sec. 24.271(b)). X's payment of tax for the period 
September 16-26 is also due no later than September 29 (Sec. 
24.271(c)(1)(i)). X may use the safe harbor rule to determine the amount 
of payment due for the period of September 16-26 (Sec. 24.271(c)(2)). 
Under the safe harbor rule, X's payment of tax must not be less than 
$21,990.00, that is, 11/15ths of the tax liability incurred during the 
first semimonthly period of September. Additionally, X must pay the tax 
in the amount of $2,000 for the period September 27-30 no later than 
October 14 (Sec. 24.271(c)(1)(i)). X must also pay the underpayment of 
tax, $23,010.00, for the period September 16-26, no later than October 
14 (Sec. 24.271(c)(2)).

    Effective Date Note: By T.D. TTB-89, 76 FR 3509, Jan. 20, 2011, 
Sec. 24.271 was revised, effective Feb. 22, 2011 to Feb. 24, 2014.


<R05>
Sec. 24.272  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.

    (a) General. (1) During a calendar year any proprietor who is liable 
for a gross amount of wine excise tax equal to or exceeding $5 million 
combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 
of this chapter, shall during the succeeding calendar year use a 
financial institution in making payment by electronic fund transfer 
(EFT) of wine taxes for that year. A proprietor who is required by this 
section to make remittance by EFT may not effect payment of wine taxes 
by cash, check, or money order as described in Sec. 24.271.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax 
liability is defined as the gross tax liability on all taxable 
withdrawals and importations (including wines brought into the United 
States from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, 
without regard to any drawback, credit, or refund, for all premises from 
which the activities are conducted by the proprietor.

[[Page 664]]

    (3) For the purposes of this section, a proprietor includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 5061 (e)(3). 
Also, the rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a 
similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole 
proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50 percent control 
over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships 
and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group 
are one taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make 
remittances by EFT.
    (4) A proprietor who is required by this section to make remittances 
by EFT shall, for each bonded wine premises from which wine is withdrawn 
upon determination of tax, make a separate EFT remittance and file a 
separate tax return.
    (b) Requirements. (1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, 
except for a proprietor already remitting the tax by EFT, each 
proprietor who was liable during the previous calendar year for a gross 
amount of wine excise tax equal to or exceeding $5 million, combining 
tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 of this 
chapter, shall give written notice to the appropriate TTB officer 
agreeing to make remittances by EFT.
    (2) For each return filed in accordance with this subpart, the 
proprietor shall direct the proprietor's financial institution to make 
an electronic fund transfer in the amount of the taxpayment to the 
Treasury Account as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. The 
request will be made to the financial institution early enough for the 
transfer of funds to be made to the Treasury Account by no later than 
the close of business on the last day for filing the return as 
prescribed in Sec. 24.271. The request will take into account any time 
limit established by the financial institution.
    (3) If the proprietor was liable during the preceding calendar year 
for less than $5 million in wine excise taxes, combining tax liabilities 
incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter, the 
proprietor may choose either to continue remitting the tax as provided 
in this section or to remit the tax with return as prescribed by Sec. 
24.271. Upon filing the first return on which the proprietor chooses to 
discontinue remittance of the tax by EFT and to begin remittance of the 
tax with the tax return, the proprietor shall notify the appropriate TTB 
officer by attaching a written notification to the tax form stating that 
no wine excise tax is due by EFT because the tax liability during the 
preceding calendar year was less than $5 million, and that the 
remittance will be filed with the tax return.
    (c) Remittance. (1) The proprietor shall show on the tax return 
information about remitting the tax for that return by EFT and shall 
file the return with TTB in accordance with the instructions on the tax 
form.
    (2) Remittances will be considered as made when the taxpayment by 
electronic fund transfer is received by the Treasury Account. For 
purposes of this section, a taxpayment by electronic fund transfer will 
be considered as received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a 
Federal Reserve Bank.
    (3) When the proprietor directs the financial institution to effect 
an electronic fund transfer message as required by paragraph (b) (2) of 
this section, the transfer data record furnished to the proprietor 
through normal banking procedures will serve as the record of payment, 
and will be retained as part of the required records.
    (d) Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT. The proprietor is subject 
to a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5684, 6651, and 6656, as applicable, 
for failure to make a taxpayment by EFT on or before the close of 
business on the prescribed last day for filing.
    (e) Procedure. Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will issue to the 
proprietor a TTB Procedure entitled, Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund 
Transfer. This publication outlines the procedure a proprietor follows 
when preparing returns and EFT remittances in accordance with this 
subpart. The United States Customs Service will provide the proprietor 
with instructions for preparing EFT remittances for payments to be made 
to the United States Customs

Sec. 24.273  Exception to filing semimonthly or quarterly tax returns.

    (a) Eligibility for annual filing. A proprietor may file the Excise 
Tax Return, TTB F 5000.24, and remittance within 30 days after the end 
of the calendar year instead of semimonthly or quarterly as provided in 
Sec. 24.271, if the proprietor has not given a bond for deferred 
payment of wine excise tax and if the proprietor:
    (1) Paid wine excise taxes in an amount less than $1000 during the 
previous calendar year, or
    (2) Is the proprietor of a newly established bonded wine premises 
and expects to pay less than $1000 in wine excise taxes before the end 
of the calendar year.
    (b) Loss of eligibility for annual filing. (1) If before the close 
of the current calendar year the wine excise tax owed will exceed the 
amount of the coverage under the proprietor's operations bond for wine 
removed from bonded wine premises on which tax has been determined but 
not paid, the proprietor will file an Excise Tax Return with the total 
remittance on the date the wine excise tax owed will exceed such amount 
and file an aggregate Excise Tax Return within 30 days after the close 
of the calendar year showing the total wine tax liability for such 
calendar year. If before the close of the current calendar year the wine 
excise tax liability (including any amounts paid or owed) equals $1000 
or more, the proprietor will commence semimonthly or quarterly filing of 
the wine Excise Tax Returns and making of payments as required by Sec. 
24.271.
    (2) If there is a jeopardy to the revenue, the appropriate TTB 
officer may at any time require the proprietor to file Excise Tax 
Returns on a semimonthly or quarterly basis.
    (c) Other rules apply. A proprietor who files on a calendar year 
basis under this section is subject to the failure to pay or file 
provisions of Sec. 24.274.

Sec. 24.274  Failure to timely pay tax or file a return.

    Penalties for failure to pay tax at the time required, for willful 
refusal to pay the tax and for fraudulent nonpayment of tax are provided 
for in 26 U.S.C. 5661 and 6656. In addition to these penalties, there is 
a penalty for the delinquent filing of a tax return, imposed as an 
addition to the tax shown on the return, amounting to five percent for 
each month or fraction thereof of the delinquency, not exceeding 25 
percent in the aggregate, unless it is shown that the delinquency is due 
to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.

Sec. 24.275  Prepayment of tax.

    (a) General. The proprietor shall, before removal of wine for 
consumption or sale, file Excise Tax Return, TTB F 5000.24, with 
remittance, where:
    (1) Required to prepay tax under Sec. 24.276; or,
    (2) The tax deferral bond is not in the maximum penal sum and the 
tax determined and unpaid at any one time exceeds the penal sum of the 
bond by more than the amount of such tax covered by the wine operations 
coverage of the wine bond; or,
    (3) There is no approved tax deferral bond and the total amount of 
tax unpaid at any one time exceeds the amount of the wine operations 
coverage of the wine bond designated for wine removed from bonded wine 
premises on which tax has been determined but not paid.

The return with remittance is forwarded pursuant to the instructions 
printed on the return. For the purpose of complying with this section, 
the term ``forwarding'' means deposit in

the United States mail properly addressed to TTB.
    (b) Electronic fund transfer. When the proprietor is required by 
Sec. 24.272 to deliver payment of tax by electronic fund transfer, the 
proprietor shall prepay the tax before any wine can be removed for 
consumption or sale by:
    (1) Completing the Excise Tax Return and by mailing it, as 
instructed on the form, to TTB and
    (2) Directing the proprietor's financial institution to effect an

Sec. 24.276  Prepayment of tax; proprietor in default.

    When the proprietor fails to forward a payment for wine excise tax 
due by presentment of a check or money order, or when the proprietor is 
otherwise in default of payment of the tax, no wine may be removed for 
consumption or sale until the tax has been paid for the period of the 
default and until the appropriate TTB officer finds the revenue will not 
be jeopardized by the late payment of the tax. Any remittance made 
during the period of the default will be in cash, or will be in the form 
of a certified, cashier's, or treasurer's check drawn on any financial 
institution incorporated under the laws of the United States, or under 
the laws of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or

Sec. 24.277  Date of mailing or delivering of returns.

    (a) When the proprietor sends the Excise Tax Return, TTB F 5000.24, 
with or without remittance, by United States mail, the official postmark 
of the United States Postal Service stamped on the cover of the envelope 
in which the return was mailed is considered the date of delivery of the 
tax return and, if accompanied, the date of delivery of the remittance. 
When the postmark on the cover is illegible, it is the proprietor's 
responsibility to prove when the postmark was made.
    (b) When the proprietor sends the tax return by registered mail or 
by certified mail, the date of registry or the date of the postmark on 
the sender's receipt of certified mail, as the case may be, is treated 
at the date of delivery of the tax return and, if accompanied, the date 
of delivery of the remittance.

<R05>
Sec. 24.278  Tax credit for certain small domestic producers.

    (a) General. A person who produces not more than 250,000 gallons of 
wine during the calendar year may take a credit against any tax imposed 
by Title 26 of the United States Code (other than Chapters 2, 21, and 
22), in an amount computed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this 
section, on the first 100,000 gallons of wine (other than champagne and 
other sparkling wine) removed during that year for consumption or sale. 
This credit applies only to

[[Page 667]]

wine that has been produced at a qualified bonded wine premises in the 
United States. The small domestic wine producer tax credit is available 
only to eligible proprietors engaged in the business of producing wine. 
A proprietor who has a basic permit to produce wine but does not produce 
wine during a calendar year may not take the small producer wine tax 
credit on wine removed during that calendar year. A proprietor who has 
obtained a new wine producer basic permit may not take the small 
producer wine tax credit on wine removed until the proprietor has 
produced wine. ``Production'' of wine includes those activities 
described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (b) Special rules relating to eligibility for wine credit--(1) 
Controlled groups. For purposes of this section and Sec. 24.279, the 
term ``person'' includes a controlled group of corporations, as defined 
in 26 U.S.C. 1563(a), except that the phrase ``more than 50 percent'' 
must be substituted for the phrase ``at least 80 percent'' wherever it 
appears. Also, the rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' 
apply in a similar fashion to groups that include partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships. Production and removals of all members of a 
controlled group are treated as if they were the production and removals 
of a single taxpayer for the purpose of determining what credit a person 
may use.
    (2) Credit for transferees in bond. A person other than the eligible 
small producer (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as the 
``transferee'') may take the credit under paragraph (a) of this section 
that would be allowed to that producer if the wine removed by the 
transferee had been removed by the producer on that date, under the 
following conditions:
    (i) Wine produced by any person would be eligible for any credit 
under this section if removed by that person during the calendar year;
    (ii) Wine produced by that person is removed during that calendar 
year by the transferee to whom that wine was transferred in bond and who 
is liable for the tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5041 with respect to that 
wine;
    (iii) That producer holds title to that wine at the time of its 
removal and provides to the transferee such information as is necessary 
to properly determine the transferee's credit under this paragraph; and
    (iv) At the time of taxable removal, the producer provides to the 
transferee, in writing (each retaining a copy with the record of taxpaid 
removal from bond pursuant to Sec. 24.310), the following information:
    (A) The names of the producer and transferee;
    (B) The quantity and tax class of the wines to be shipped;
    (C) The date of removal from bond for consumption or sale;
    (D) A confirmation that the producer is eligible for credit, with 
the credit rate to which the wines are entitled; and
    (E) A confirmation that the subject shipment is within the first 
100,000 gallons of eligible wine removed by (or on behalf of) the 
producer for the calendar year.
    (c) Time for determining and allowing credit. The credit referred to 
in paragraph (a) of this section will be determined at the same time as 
the tax is determined under 26 U.S.C. 5041(a), and will be allowable at 
the time any tax described in paragraph (a) of this section is payable. 
The credit allowable by this section is treated as if it constitutes a 
reduction in the rate of the tax.
    (d) Computation of credit. The credit which may be taken on the 
first 100,000 gallons of wine (other than champagne and other sparkling 
wine) removed for consumption or sale by an eligible person during a 
calendar year is computed as follows:
    (1) For persons who produce 150,000 gallons or less of wine during 
the calendar year, the credit is $0.90 per gallon for wine ($0.056 for 
hard cider);
    (2) For persons who produce more than 150,000 gallons but not more 
than 250,000 gallons during the calendar year, the credit is reduced by 
1 percent for every 1,000 gallons produced in excess of 150,000 gallons. 
For example, the credit that would be taken by a person who produced 
160,500 gallons of wine and hard cider during a calendar year would be 
reduced by 10 percent, for a

[[Page 668]]

net credit against the tax of $0.81 per gallon for wine or $0.0504 for 
hard cider, as long as the wine or hard cider was among the first 
100,000 gallons removed for consumption or sale during the calendar 
year.
    (e) Definitions--(1) Production. For purposes of determining if a 
person's production of wine is within the 250,000 gallon limit, 
production includes, in addition to wine produced by fermentation, any 
increase in the volume of wine due to the winery operations of 
amelioration, wine spirits addition, sweetening, or production of 
formula wine. Production of champagne and other sparkling wines is 
included for purposes of determining whether total production of a 
winery exceeds 250,000 gallons. Production includes all wine produced at 
qualified bonded wine premises within the United States and wine 
produced outside the United States by the same person.
    (2) Removals. For purposes of determining if a person's removals are 
within the 100,000 gallon limit, removals include wine that the person 
removed from all qualified bonded wine premises within the United 
States. Wine removed by a transferee in bond under paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section must be counted against the 100,000 gallon limit of the 
small producer who owns that wine, and not against the limit of the 
transferee in bond if the transferee is also a small producer. Champagne 
and other sparkling wines, which are not eligible for credit, do not 
count as removals against the 100,000 gallon limit.
    (f) Preparation of tax return. A person who is eligible for the 
credit must show the amount of wine tax before credit on the Excise Tax 
Return, TTB F 5000.24, and must enter the quantity of wine subject to 
the credit and the applicable credit rate as the explanation for an 
adjusting entry in Schedule B of the return for each tax period. Where a 
person does not use the credit authorized by this section to directly 
reduce the rate of Federal excise tax on wine, that person must report 
on TTB F 5000.24 where the credit will be, or has been, applied. Where a 
transferee in bond takes credit on behalf of one or more small 
producers, the transferee must show in Schedule B of the return the name 
of each producer, each producer's credit rate, and the total credit 
taken on behalf of each producer during the tax return period.
    (g) Denial of deduction. Pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 5041(c)(5), any 
deduction under 26 U.S.C. subtitle A with respect to any tax against 
which the credit is allowed under paragraph (a) of this section must 
only be for the amount of the tax as reduced by the credit.
    (h) Exception to credit. The appropriate TTB officer will deny any 
tax credit taken under paragraph (a) of this section where it is 
determined that the allowance of the credit would benefit a person who 
would otherwise fail to qualify for the use of the credit.

<R05>
Sec. 24.279  Tax adjustments related to wine credit.

    (a) Increasing adjustments. Persons who produce more wine than the 
amount used in computation of the credit, or who lose eligibility by not 
producing during a calendar year, must make increasing tax adjustments. 
Where an increasing adjustment to a person's tax return is necessary as 
a result of an incorrect credit rate claimed pursuant to Sec. 24.278, 
that person must make the adjustment on the Excise Tax Return, TTB F 
5000.24, no later than the return period in which production (or the 
production of the controlled group of which the person is a member) 
exceeds the amount used in computation of the credit. If the adjustment 
is due to failure to produce, the person must make the adjustment no 
later than the last return period of the calendar year. The adjustment 
is the difference between the credit taken for prior return periods in 
that year and the appropriate credit for those return periods. The 
person must make tax adjustments for all bonded wine premises where 
excess credits were taken against tax that year, and must include 
interest payable. In the case of a person who continued to deduct credit 
after reaching the 100,000 gallon maximum during the calendar year, that 
person must make an adjustment in the full amount of excess credit

[[Page 669]]

taken and must include interest payable under 26 U.S.C. 6601 from the 
date on which the excess credit was taken. In addition, the person must 
include the penalty payable under 26 U.S.C. 6662 if the appropriate TTB 
officer determines that the underpayment was due to negligence or 
disregard of rules or regulations and advises the person to include the 
penalty as part of the adjustment. The appropriate TTB officer will 
provide information, when requested, regarding interest rates applicable 
to specific time periods and regarding any applicable penalties. In the 
case of a controlled group of bonded wine premises that took excess 
credits, all member proprietors who took incorrect credits must make tax 
adjustments as determined in this section. In the case of a small 
producer who instructed a transferee in bond to take credit as 
authorized by Sec. 24.278(b)(2), and subsequently determines that the 
credit was less or not applicable, that producer must immediately inform 
the transferee in bond, in writing, of the correct credit information. 
The transferee must make any increasing adjustment on its next tax 
return based on revised credit information given by the producer or a 
TTB officer.
    (b) Decreasing adjustments. Where a person fails to deduct the 
credit or deducts less than the appropriate credit provided for by Sec. 
24.278 during the calendar year, the person may file a claim for refund 
of excess tax paid. The claim must be filed in accordance with Sec. 
24.69. In the case of wine removed on behalf of a small producer by a 
transferee in bond, if the transferee in bond was instructed to deduct 
credit and failed to deduct credit or deducted less than the appropriate 
credit and was later reimbursed for the tax by that producer, the 
transferee may file the claim. The provisions of 26 U.S.C. 6423 and 27 
CFR part 70, subpart F, will apply, and the producer and transferee in 
bond must show that the conditions of Sec. 24.278(b)(2) were met.

                         Taxpaid Wine Operations


<R05>
Sec. 24.296  Taxpaid wine operations.

    (a) General. The proprietor may conduct taxpaid wine operations 
authorized by Sec. 24.102 in an area designated as a taxpaid wine 
premises at a bonded wine premises or at a taxpaid wine bottling house. 
Taxpaid foreign wine may be received on the taxpaid wine premises for 
reconditioning and removal without retaxpayment or for destruction 
without credit of tax. Any taxpaid wine operations will be separate from 
all nontaxpaid wine operations and taxpaid wine will be clearly 
identified as provided in Sec. 24.135. The appropriate TTB officer may 
require any additional segregation and identification of taxpaid wine 
operations as deemed necessary to protect the revenue.
    (b) Treatment and blending. Taxpaid wine may be treated with sulfur 
dioxide compounds, refrigeration or pasteurization and may also be 
preserved, filtered or clarified by the use of methods or materials 
which will not change the basic character of the wine. Water may not be 
added to taxpaid wine. The proprietor who desires to treat wine in any 
manner (other than by simple filtration or the use of sulfur compounds, 
refrigeration or pasteurization) shall first file with the appropriate 
TTB officer an application giving the details of the proposed treatment. 
The proprietor may not use the treatment prior to approval. The 
proprietor may incur civil or criminal liability for using an 
unauthorized treatment of untaxpaid wine. Wine of the same kind (class 
and type), national origin and tax class may only be mixed to facilitate 
handling at a taxpaid wine bottling house; otherwise, the blending of 
taxpaid wine on such premises is prohibited. Taxpaid wine of different 
national origins, but of the same kind and tax class, may only be 
blended on taxpaid wine premises. (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat.

      48  187 mL............................................     2.37119
      24  375 mL............................................     2.37753
      12  750 mL............................................     2.37753
      12  1 liter...........................................     3.17004
       6  1.5 liter.........................................     2.37753
       4  3 liter...........................................     3.17004
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Per liter. Equivalent gallonage may be determined by multiplying 
total liters by a conversion factor of 0.26417 gallons per liter.
    (b) Time of making entries. Any operation or transaction is to be 
entered in records or commercial papers at the time the operation or 
transaction occurs, except that where records are posted from source 
records or from supplemental auxiliary records prepared at the time the 
operation or transaction occurs, entries in another record may be 
deferred to not later than the close of business of the third business 
day succeeding the day on which the operation or transaction occurs. The 
proprietor shall retain all source

[[Page 674]]

records and all supplemental or auxiliary records which support entries 
in other records or commercial papers in order to facilitate 
verification of operations by appropriate TTB officers. Source records 
and supplemental or auxiliary records may be used as a record of an 
operation or transaction and to prepare the TTB F 5120.17, Report of 
Bonded Wine Premises Operations, provided the record will readily allow 
for verification of an operation or transaction by appropriate TTB 
officers.
    (c) Prescribed forms. All reports required by this part must be 
submitted on forms prescribed by Sec. 24.20. Entries will be made as 
indicated by the headings of the columns and lines, and as required by 
the instructions for the form. Report forms are furnished free of cost.
    (d) Period of retention. All prescribed returns, reports and records 
(including source records) will be retained by the proprietor for a 
period of not less than three years from the record date or the date of 
the last entry required to be made in the record, whichever is later. 
However, the appropriate TTB officer may require records to be kept an 
additional period not exceeding three years in any case where retention 
is determined to be necessary.
    (e) Data processing. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
section, data maintained on data processing equipment may be kept at a 
location other than the wine premises if the original operation or 
transaction source records required by this subpart are kept available 
for inspection at the wine premises.
    (2) Data which has been accumulated on cards, tapes, discs, or other 
accepted recording media will be retrievable within five business days.
    (3) The applicable data processing program will be made available 
for examination if requested by an appropriate TTB officer.
    (f) Photographic copies of records. The proprietor may record, copy, 
or reproduce records required by this part and may use any process which 
accurately reproduces the original record and which forms a durable 
medium for reproducing and preserving the original record. Whenever 
records are reproduced under this section, the reproduced records will 
be preserved in conveniently accessible files, and provisions will be 
made for examining, viewing and using the reproduced record the same as 
if it were the original record, and it will be treated and considered 
for all purposes as though it were the original record. All provisions 
of law and regulations applicable to the original are applicable to the 
reproduced record. As used in this paragraph, ``original record'' means 
the record required to be maintained or preserved by the proprietor, 
even though it may be an executed duplicate or other copy of the 
document.
    (g) TTB F 5120.17, Report of Bonded Wine Premises Operations. A 
proprietor who conducts bonded wine premises operations must complete 
and submit TTB F 5120.17 in accordance with the instructions on the

a completed TTB F 5120.17 on a quarterly or annual basis if the 
proprietor meets the criteria in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) or (g)(2)(iii) of 
this section. To begin the quarterly or annual filing of a report of 
bonded wine premises operations, a proprietor must state the intent to 
do so in the ``Remarks'' section when filing the prior month's TTB F 
5120.17. A proprietor who is commencing operations during a calendar 
year and expects to meet these criteria may use a letter notice to the 
appropriate TTB officer and file TTB F 5120.17 quarterly or annually for 
the remaining portion of the calendar year. If a proprietor becomes 
ineligible for quarterly or annual filing by exceeding the applicable 
tax liability or activity limit, the proprietor must file TTB F 5120.17 
for that month and for all subsequent months of the calendar year. If 
there is jeopardy to the revenue, the appropriate TTB officer may at any 
time require any proprietor otherwise eligible for quarterly or annual 
filing of a report of bonded wine premises operations to file such 
report monthly.

[[Page 675]]

    (ii) Eligibility for quarterly report filing. In order to be 
eligible to file TTB F 5120.17 on a quarterly basis, the proprietor must 
be filing quarterly tax returns under Sec. 24.271, and the proprietor

beginning of the month, bulk wine produced by fermentation, sweetening, 
blending, amelioration or addition of wine spirits, bulk wine bottled, 
bulk and bottled wine received in bond, taxpaid wine returned to bond, 
bottled wine dumped to bulk, inventory gains, and any activity written 
in the untitled lines of the report form which increases the amount of 
wine to be accounted for.
    (3) No reportable activity. A proprietor who files a monthly TTB F 
5120.17 and does not expect an inventory change or any reportable 
operations to be conducted in a subsequent month or months may attach to 
the filed TTB F 5120.17 a statement that, until a change in the 
inventory or a reportable operation occurs, a TTB F 5120.17 will not be

Sec. 24.304  Chaptalization (Brix adjustment) and amelioration record.

    (a) General. A proprietor who chaptalizes juice or ameliorates juice 
or wine, or both, shall maintain a record of the operation and the 
transaction date. Records will be maintained for each kind of wine 
produced (grape, apple, strawberry, etc.). No form of record is 
prescribed, but the record maintained will contain the information 
necessary to enable appropriate TTB officers to readily determine 
compliance with chaptalization and amelioration limitations. All 
quantities will be recorded in wine gallons, and, where sugar is used, 
the quantity will be determined either by measuring the increase in 
volume or, for pure dry sugar by considering that each 13.5 pounds 
results in a volumetric increase of one gallon. If grape juice is 
chaptalized and subsequently this juice or wine is ameliorated, the 
quantity of pure dry sugar added to juice will be included as 
ameliorating material. If fruit juice other than grape is chaptalized 
and this juice or wine is ameliorated, the quantity of pure dry sugar 
added for chaptalization is not considered ameliorating material; 
however, if liquid sugar or invert sugar syrup is used, the quantity of 
water in such sugar is included as ameliorating material. The record 
will include the following:
    (1) The volume of juice (exclusive of pulp) deposited in fermenters;
    (2) The maximum volume of ameliorating material to which the juice 
is entitled, as provided in Sec. 24.178;
    (3) The volume of ameliorating or chaptalizing material used; and
    (4) The volume of material authorized but not yet used.
    (b) Supporting records. The amelioration record will show the basis 
for entries and calculations, including determination of the natural 
fixed acid level and total solids content of juice, as applicable. The 
records are maintained on the basis of annual accounting periods, with 
each period commencing on July 1 of a year and ending on the following 
June 30, except the record for an accounting period may be continued 
after June 30, where the juice or wine included therein is to be held 
after that date for completion. When the amelioration of wine included 
in the record for one accounting period is complete, the record is 
closed and any unused ameliorating material may not be used. The 
proprietor may mix wines before amelioration of the wine is completed; 
however, the proprietor shall additionally maintain records necessary to 
establish the quantity of unused authorized material to which the 
resultant mixture would be entitled so that appropriate TTB officers may 
readily ascertain compliance with amelioration limitations.

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1381, as amended 1385, as amended

Sec. 25.15  Materials for the production of beer.

    (a) Beer must be brewed from malt or from substitutes for malt. Only 
rice, grain of any kind, bran, glucose, sugar, and molasses are 
substitutes for malt. In addition, you may also use the following 
materials as adjuncts in fermenting beer: honey, fruit, fruit juice,

alcohol in producing beer. Flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients 
containing alcohol may contribute no more than 49% of the overall 
alcohol content of the finished beer. For example, a finished beer that 
contains 5.0% alcohol by volume must derive a minimum of 2.55% alcohol 
by volume from the fermentation of ingredients at the brewery and may 
derive not more than 2.45% alcohol by volume from the addition of 
flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol. In the 
case of beer with an alcohol content of more than 6% by volume, no more

``lager,'' or ``malt liquor.'' For purposes of this paragraph:
    (i) Removal of any volume of water from beer, filtration of beer to 
substantially change the color, flavor, or character, separation of beer 
into different components, reverse osmosis, concentration of beer, and 
ion exchange treatments are examples of non-traditional processes for 
which you must file a formula.
    (ii) Pasteurization, filtration prior to bottling, filtration in 
lieu of pasteurization, centrifuging for clarity, lagering, carbonation, 
and blending are examples of traditional processes for which you do not 
need to file a formula.
    (iii) If you have questions about whether or not use of a particular 
process not listed in this section requires the filing of a formula, you 
may request a determination from TTB in accordance with paragraph (f) of 
this section.
    (2) Any fermented product to which flavors or other nonbeverage 
ingredients (other than hop extract) containing alcohol will be added.
    (3) Subject to paragraph (f) of this section, any fermented product 
to which coloring or natural or artificial flavors will be added.
    (4) Subject to paragraph (f) of this section, any fermented product 
to which fruit, fruit juice, fruit concentrate, herbs, spices, honey, 
maple syrup, or other food materials will be added.
    (5) Sak[eacute], including flavored sak[eacute] and sparkling 
sak[eacute].
    (b) Are separate formulas required for different products? (1) You 
must file a separate formula for approval for each different fermented 
product for which a formula is required.
    (2) You may file a formula for a beer base to be used in the 
production of one or more other fermented products. The beer base must 
conform to the standards set forth in Sec. 25.15.
    (c) When must I file a formula? (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, you may not produce a fermented product for 
which a formula is required until you have filed and received approval 
of a formula for that product.
    (2) You may, for research and development purposes (including 
consumer taste testing), produce a fermented product without an approved 
formula, but you may not sell or market this product until you receive 
approval of the formula for it.
    (d) How long is my formula approval valid? Your formula approved 
under this section remains in effect until: you supersede it with a new 
formula; you voluntarily surrender the formula; TTB cancels or revokes 
the formula; or the formula is revoked by operation of law or 
regulation.
    (e) Are my previously approved statements of process valid? Your 
statements of process approved before January 3, 2006 are considered 
approved formulas under this section, provided that any finished product 
that could be made under the statement of process would be in compliance 
with the provisions of this part. You do not need to submit a formula 
for approval if a statement of process that remains valid covers the 
product.
    (f) Determinations by TTB regarding specific processes and 
ingredients. (1) The appropriate TTB officer may determine whether or 
not use of a process not listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
requires you to file a formula for approval. The appropriate TTB officer 
may also exempt the use of a particular coloring, flavoring, or food 
material from the formula filing requirement of paragraph (a)(3) or 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section upon a finding that the coloring, 
flavoring, or food

[[Page 694]]

material in question is generally recognized as a traditional ingredient 
in the production of a fermented beverage designated as ``beer,'' 
``ale,'' ``porter,'' ``stout,'' ``lager,'' or ``malt liquor.''
    (2) You may request a determination from TTB on whether or not the 
use of a process not listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section will 
require the filing of a formula or whether the use of a particular 
coloring, flavoring or food material may be exempted from the formula 
filing requirement of paragraph (a)(3) or paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section. You should mail your request to the Assistant Chief, 
Advertising, Labeling and Formulation Division, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax 
and Trade Bureau, 1310 G Street, NW., Washington, DC 20220.

    (a) Ingredient information. (1) For each formula you must list each 
separate ingredient and the specific quantity used, or a range of 
quantities used. You may include optional ingredients in a formula if 
they do not impact the labeling or identity of the finished product.
    (2) For fermented products containing flavorings you must list for 
each formula: The name of the flavor; the product number or TTB drawback 
number and approval date of the flavor; the name and location (city and 
State) of the flavor manufacturer; the alcohol content of the flavor; 
and the point of production at which the flavor was added (that is, 
before, during, or after fermentation).
    (3) For formulas that include the use of flavors and other 
nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol, you must explicitly 
indicate:
    (i) The volume and alcohol content of the beer base;
    (ii) The maximum volumes of the flavors and other nonbeverage 
ingredients containing alcohol to be used;
    (iii) The alcoholic strength of the flavors and other nonbeverage 
ingredients containing alcohol;
    (iv) The overall alcohol contribution to the finished product 
provided by the addition of any flavors or other nonbeverage ingredients 
containing alcohol. You are not required to list the alcohol 
contribution of individual flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients 
containing alcohol. You may state the total alcohol contribution from 
these ingredients to the finished product; and

[[Page 695]]

    (v) The final volume and alcohol content of the finished product.
    (b) Process information. For each formula you must describe in 
detail each process used to produce a fermented beverage.

content of the fermented product after fermentation and the alcohol 
content of the finished product.
    (d) Beer base formulas. You must refer in your formula to any 
approved formula number that covers the production of any beer base used 
in producing the formula product. If the beer base was produced by 
another brewery of the same ownership, you must also provide the name 
and address or name and registry number of that brewery.
    (e) Additional information. The appropriate TTB officer may at any 
time require you to file additional information concerning a fermented

    (6) Change the contribution of alcohol from flavors or ingredients 
that contain alcohol.
    (b) Superseding formulas. You may file a superseding formula, 
instead of a new formula, if you have made any change listed in 
paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(6) of this section and that change is not 
of a type that would require a holder of a certificate of label approval 
to file a new application for label approval on TTB Form 5100.31.
    (1) A superseding formula replaces an existing formula, and you 
should file one only if you do not intend to use the existing formula 
any more. A superseding formula must be filed with TTB for approval. 
When TTB approves a superseding formula, TTB will cancel your previous 
formula.
    (2) You may use the same formula number for a superseding formula 
that you used for the formula the superseding formula replaces, but you 
must annotate the formula number to indicate it is a superseding formula 
number. (For example, ``Formula 2, superseding.'')
    (c) When you file a new or superseding formula with TTB, you must 
follow the procedures and other requirements of Sec. Sec. 25.56 and 
25.57.

and penalties incurred or fines imposed for violations of those 
provisions.
    (c) Additional information. The appropriate TTB officer shall 
require, in connection with any brewer's bond, a statement executed

of the business of the principal has been convicted of or has 
compromised any offense set forth in Sec. 25.101(a)(1), or has been 
convicted of any offense set forth in Sec. 25.101(a)(2). In the event 
the above statement contains an affirmative answer, the applicant shall 
submit a statement describing in detail the circumstances surrounding 
the conviction or compromise.

maximum amount of tax calculated at the rates prescribed by law which 
the brewer will become liable to pay during a calendar year during the 
period of the bond on beer:
    (i) Removed for transfer to the brewery from other breweries owned 
by the same brewer;

[[Page 701]]

    (ii) Removed without payment of tax for export or for use as

calendar year. The brewer shall add this amount to the penal sum 
calculated under paragraph (a) of this section to determine the total 
penal sum of the brewer's bond.
    (c) Maximum and minimum penal sums. The maximum penal sum of the 
bond (or total penal sum if original and strengthening bonds are filed) 
is not to exceed $150,000 when the tax on beer is to be prepaid, or

Sec. 25.94  Strengthening bonds.

    (a) Requirement. When the penal sum of the brewer's bond (calculated 
as provided in Sec. 25.93) in effect is not sufficient, the principal 
may prepay the tax on beer as provided in subpart K of this part, or 
give a strengthening bond in sufficient penal sum if the surety is the 
same as on the bond in effect. If the surety is not the same, a new bond 
covering the entire liability is required.
    (b) Restrictions. A strengthening bond may not in any way release a 
former bond or limit a bond to less than the full penal sum.
    (c) Date of execution. Strengthening bonds will show the current

<R05>
Sec. 25.95  New bond.

    The appropriate TTB officer may at any time, at his or her 
discretion, require a new bond. A new bond is required immediately in 
the case of insolvency of a surety. Executors, administrators, 
assignees, receivers, trustees, or other persons acting in a fiduciary 
capacity shall execute a new bond or obtain a consent of surety on all 
bonds in effect. When the interests of the Government so demand, or in 
any case when the security of the bond becomes impaired for any reason, 
the principal will be required to give a new bond. When a bond is found 
to be not acceptable by the appropriate TTB officer, the principal will 
be required immediately to obtain a new and satisfactory bond or 
discontinue business.

<R05>
Sec. 25.96  Superseding bond.

    When the principal submits a new bond to supersede a bond or bonds 
in effect, the appropriate TTB officer, after approving the superseding 
bond, will issue a notice of termination for the superseded bond under 
the provisions of this subpart. Superseding bonds will show the current 
date of execution and their effective date.

[[Page 702]]


<R05>
Sec. 25.97  Continuation certificate.

    If the contract of surety between the brewer and the surety on an 
expiring bond or continuation certificate is continued in force for a 
succeeding period of not less than 4 years from the expiration date of 
the bond or continuation certificate, the brewer may submit, in lieu of 
a new bond, a Brewer's Bond Continuation Certificate on Form 5130.23, 
executed under the penalties of perjury, by the brewer and the surety 
attesting to continuation of the bond. Each continuation certificate 
will constitute a bond and all provisions of law and regulations 
applicable to bonds on Form 5130.22 given under this part, including the 
disapproval of bonds, are applicable to continuation certificates.

acceptable sureties on Federal bonds, subject to the limitations set 
forth in the current revision of Treasury Department Circular No. 570, 
Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Reinsuring 
Companies.
    (c) Revisions of Circular No. 570. Treasury Department Circular No. 
570 is published in the Federal Register annually as of the first 
workday in July. As they occur, interim revisions of the circular are 
published in the Federal Register. Copies may be obtained from the 
Surety Bond Branch, Financial Management Service, Department of the 
Treasury, Washington, DC 20226.
    (d) More than one corporate surety. A bond may be executed by two or 
more corporate sureties. Each corporate surety may limit its liability 
in terms on the face of the bond in a specified amount. This amount may 
not exceed the limitations set forth for corporate security by the 
Secretary which are set forth in the current revision of Treasury 
Department Circular No. 570. The sum of the liabilities for the sureties 
will equal the required penal sum of the bond.
    (e) Deposit of collateral securities in lieu of corporate surety. 
Bonds or notes of the United States, or other obligations which are 
unconditionally guaranteed as to both interest and principal by the 
United States, may be pledged and deposited by principals as collateral 
security in lieu of corporate surety in accordance with 31 CFR Part 225.

<R05>
Sec. 25.101  Disapproval of bonds or consents of surety.

    (a) Reasons for disapproval. The appropriate TTB officer may 
disapprove a bond or consent of surety if the individual, firm, 
partnership, corporation, or association giving the bond or consent of 
surety, or if any of the above entities owning, controlling or actively 
participating in the management of a business giving a bond as a brewer, 
has been previously convicted in a court of competent jurisdiction of:
    (1) Any fraudulent noncompliance with any provision of law of the 
United States if it related to internal revenue or customs taxation of 
distilled spirits, wines or beer, or if the offense shall have been 
compromised with the individual, firm, partnership, corporation, or 
association on payment of penalties or otherwise; or
    (2) Any felony under a law of any State or the District of Columbia, 
or the United States, prohibiting the manufacture, sale, importation, or

[[Page 703]]

transportation of distilled spirits, wines, beer, or other intoxicating 
liquor.
    (b) Appeal of disapproval. If the bond or consent of surety is 
disapproved, the person giving the bond or consent of surety may appeal 
the disapproval to the appropriate TTB officer, who will grant a hearing 
in the matter if requested by the applicant or brewer, and whose 
decision will be final.

appropriate TTB officer that the surety desires after a specified date 
(not less than 60 days after the date of service on the principal) to be 
relieved of any liability under the bond which is incurred by the 
principal after the date named in the notice. The surety shall include 
proof of service of the notice on the principal with the notice filed

against the bond and that it is no longer necessary to hold the 
security, he or she shall fix the date or dates on which a part or all 
of the security will be released. At any time prior to the release of 
the security, the appropriate TTB officer may, for proper cause, extend 
the date of release of the security for an additional length of time as

noted.


<R05>
Sec. 25.111  Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart, the following terms have the meanings 
indicated:
    Dealer. A person who sells, or offers for sale, any alcohol product 
(distilled spirits, wines, and/or beer) fit for beverage use.
    Retail dealer in liquors. A dealer who sells, or offers for sale, 
distilled spirits, wines, or beer to any person other than a dealer.
    Wholesale dealer in liquors. A dealer who sells, or offers for sale, 
distilled spirits, wines, or beer to another dealer.

(26 U.S.C. 5121, 5122)


<R05>
Sec. 25.112  Dealer registration.

    Every brewer who sells, or offers for sale, any alcohol product 
(distilled

[[Page 704]]

spirits, wines, or beer) fit for beverage use must register as a dealer 
in accordance with part 31 of this chapter. However, the Brewer's 
Notice, TTB Form 5130.10, filed under subpart G of this part, and 
approval of that notice by the appropriate TTB officer, will constitute 
the brewer's registration as a dealer at the brewery. Every brewer 
registered as a dealer under this subpart will be classified as a 
wholesale dealer in liquors (see Sec. 31.32 of this chapter) and as 
such may also operate as a retail dealer in liquors without additional 
registration. Registration covers all sales from the same location, 
including sales of wine, spirits, or other brewers' beer. As provided in 
Sec. 31.52 of this chapter, the brewer is subject to no additional 
registration for making sales of wine or beer at the customer's place of 
business. Otherwise, a brewer who conducts business as a dealer at a 
location other than the brewery must register and keep records in 
accordance with part 31 of this chapter.

(26 U.S.C. 5124)


<R05>
Sec. 25.113  Amending the dealer registration.

    Every brewer registered as a dealer under this subpart must maintain 
a current and accurate Brewer's Notice, TTB Form 5130.10. Whenever there 
is a change to any of the information provided in the approved Brewer's 
Notice, the brewer must amend the notice within the time period 
specified in subpart G of this part. An amendment to the Brewer's 
Notice, Form 5130.10, will also serve as an amendment of the brewer's 
dealer registration under this subpart. The brewer's dealer registration 
will also terminate when brewery operations under the Brewer's Notice 
terminate.

(26 U.S.C. 5124)


<R05>
Sec. 25.114  Dealer records.

    Every dealer is required to maintain records of transactions. Beer 
transactions that appear in the records required by subpart U of this 
part will meet the brewer's recordkeeping requirements as a dealer. For 
other transactions not covered in the brewery records, such as retail 
sales of wine or distilled spirits in a restaurant at the brewery, or 
operations as a wholesale dealer in wine or distilled spirits, the 
brewer must keep the records specified for dealers in part 31 of this 
chapter.

    (a) General requirements. The brewer's name or trade name and the 
place of production (city and, if necessary for identification, State) 
shall be permanently marked on each barrel or keg. If the place of 
production is clearly shown on the bung or on the tap cover, or on a 
label securely affixed to each barrel or keg, the place of production 
need not be permanently marked on each barrel or keg. No statement as to 
payment of internal revenue taxes may be shown.
    (b) Breweries of same ownership. (1) If two or more breweries are 
owned or operated by the same person, firm, or corporation (as defined 
in Sec. 25.181), the place of production:
    (i) May be shown as the only location on the bung, or on the tap 
cover, or on a separate label attached to the keg;
    (ii) May be included in a listing of the locations of breweries 
qualified under this part if the place of production is not given less 
emphasis than any of the other locations; or
    (iii) Need not be shown if the brewer's principal place of business 
is shown in lieu of any other location. The brewer's principal place of 
business will be the location of a brewery operated by the brewer and 
qualified under this part.
    (2) If the location of two or more breweries is shown on the keg, 
bung, tap cover, or on a separate label attached to the keg (paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii)), or if the brewer's principal place of business is shown in 
lieu of the actual place of production (paragraph (b)(1)(iii)), the 
brewer shall indicate the actual place of production by printing, coding 
or other markings on the keg, bung, tap cover, or on a separate label 
attached to the keg. The coding system employed will permit an 
appropriate TTB officer to determine the place of

[[Page 705]]

production (including street address if two or more breweries are 
located in the same city) of the beer. The brewer must notify the 
appropriate TTB officer prior to employing a coding system.
    (c) Label approval required. Labels or tap covers used by brewers 
shall be covered by certificates of label approval, Form 5100.31, when 
required by part 7 of this chapter.

Sec. 25.142  Bottles.

    (a) Label requirements. Each bottle of beer shall show by label or 
otherwise the name or trade name of the brewer, the net contents of the 
bottle, the nature of the product such as beer, ale, porter, stout, 
etc., and the place of production (city and, when necessary for 
identification, State). No statement as to payment of internal revenue 
taxes may be shown.
    (b) Breweries of same ownership. (1) If two or more breweries are 
owned or operated by the same person, firm, or corporation (as defined 
in Sec. 25.181), the place of production:
    (i) May be shown as the only location on the label;
    (ii) May be included in a listing of the locations of breweries 
qualified under this part if the place of production is not given less 
emphasis than any of the other locations; or
    (iii) Need not be shown if the brewer's principal place of business 
is shown in lieu of any other location. The brewer's principal place of 
business will be the location of a brewery operated by the brewer and 
qualified under this part.
    (2) If the location of two or more breweries is shown on the label 
(paragraph (b)(1)(ii)), or if the brewer's principal place of business 
is shown on the label in lieu of the actual place of production 
(paragraph (b)(1)(iii)), the brewer shall indicate the actual place of 
production by printing, coding or other markings on the label, bottle, 
crown or lid. The coding system employed will permit an appropriate TTB 
officer to determine the place of production (including street address 
if two or more breweries are located in the same city) of the beer. The 
brewer must notify the appropriate TTB offcer prior to employing a 
coding system.
    (c) Distinctive names. If the brewer's name, trade name or brand 
name includes the name of a city which is not the place where the beer 
was produced, the appropriate TTB officer may require the brewer to 
state the actual place of production on the label.
    (d) Tolerances. The statement of net contents shall indicate exactly 
the volume of beer within the bottle except for variations in measuring 
as may occur in filling conducted in compliance with good commercial 
practice. The barrel equivalent of bottles filled during a consecutive 
three month period, calculated on the basis of the brewer's fill test 
records, may not vary more than 0.5 percent from the barrel equivalent 
of bottles filled during the same period, calculated on the basis of the 
stated net contents of the bottles. The brewer is liable for the tax on 
the entire amount of beer removed, without benefit of tolerance, when 
the fill of bottles and cans exceeds the tolerance for the three month 
period, or when filling is not conducted in compliance with good 
commercial practice.
    (e) Label approval required. Labels used by brewers shall be covered 
by certificates of label approval, Form 5100.31, when required by part 7 
of this chapter.
    (f) Short-fill bottles. A brewer may dispose of taxpaid short-fill 
bottles of beer to employees for their use but not for resale. These 
bottles need not be labeled, but if labeled they need not show an 
accurate statement of net contents.

    (2) Bottles or cans with plastic carriers, if the visible portion of 
the bottles or cans shows the required name.
    (b) Other information. The brewer may show on a case or shipping 
container the place of production (city and, when necessary for 
identification, State), and the addresses of other breweries owned by 
the same person, firm, or corporation (as defined in Sec. 25.181). If 
only one address is shown, it will be that of the producing brewery, or

Sec. 25.144  Rebranding barrels and kegs.

    (a) A brewer may not use a barrel or keg which bears the name of 
more than one brewer, and except as provided in Sec. 25.231, may not 
use a barrel or keg bearing the name of a brewer other than the 
producing brewer.
    (b) A brewer who purchases or otherwise obtains barrels or kegs from 
another brewer shall permanently remove or durably cover the original 
marks and brands after notifying the appropriate TTB officer of the

removing or covering the original marks and brands if the brewer:
    (1) Adopts a trade name substantially identical to the name 
appearing on the barrels or kegs; or
    (2) Succeeds to a brewer who has discontinued business, in which 
case the brewer may add marks or brands, in accordance with Sec. 
25.141, which indicate ownership.

<R05>
Sec. 25.151  Rate of tax.

    All beer, brewed or produced, and removed for consumption or sale, 
is subject to the tax prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5051, for every barrel 
containing not more than 31 gallons, and at a like rate for any other 
quantity or for the fractional parts of a barrel as authorized in Sec. 
25.156.

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1333, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5051,

<R05>
Sec. 25.152  Reduced rate of tax for certain brewers.

    (a) General. Section 5051(a)(2) of Title 26 U.S.C. provides for a 
reduced rate of tax on the first 60,000 barrels of beer removed for 
consumption or sale by a brewer during a calendar year. To be eligible 
to pay the reduced rate of tax, a brewer:
    (1) Shall brew or produce the beer at a qualified brewery in the 
United States;

[[Page 707]]

    (2) May not produce more than 2,000,000 barrels of beer per calendar 
year; and
    (3) May not be a member of a ``controlled group'' of brewers whose 
members together produce more than 2,000,000 barrels of beer per 
calendar year.

The appropriate TTB officer shall deny use of the reduced rate of tax 
provided by 26 U.S.C. 5051(a)(2) where it is determined that the 
allowance of such a reduced rate would benefit a person who would 
otherwise fail to qualify for use of such rate.
    (b) Definitions. For the purpose of determining eligibility for 
payment of the reduced rate of tax on beer, terms have the following 
meanings:
    (1) Controlled group. A related group of brewers as defined in 26 
U.S.C. 5051(a)(2)(B). Controlled groups include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Parent-subsidiary controlled groups as defined in 26 CFR 1.1563-
1(a)(2);
    (ii) Brother-sister controlled groups as defined in 26 CFR 1.1563-
1(a)(3); and
    (iii) Combined groups as defined in 26 CFR 1.1563-1(a)(4). Stock 
ownership in a corporation need not be direct and 51% constructive 
ownership, defined in 26 CFR 1.1563-3, may be acquired through:
    (A) An option to purchase stock;
    (B) Attribution from partnerships;
    (C) Attribution from estate or trusts;
    (D) Attribution from corporations; or
    (E) Ownership by spouses, children, grandchildren, parents, and 
grandparents.
    (2) Production of beer. The production of beer as recorded in the 
brewer's daily records and reported in the Brewer's Report of 
Operations, Form 5130.9. For the purpose of determining compliance with 
the 2,000,000 barrel limitation, production of beer by a brewer or a 
controlled group of brewers includes both beer produced at qualified 
breweries within the United States and beer produced outside the United 
States.
    (c) Brewers operating more than one brewery. Brewers who operate 
more than one brewery shall include the combined production of beer at 
all their breweries when determining eligibility under the 2,000,000 
barrel limitation. The reduced rate of tax applies to the first 60,000 
barrels of beer removed for consumption or sale in a calendar year by 
the brewer; the brewer shall apportion the 60,000 barrels among the 
breweries in the manner described in the notice as provided by Sec. 
25.167(b)(3).
    (d) Controlled groups of brewers. Members of a controlled group of 
brewers shall include the combined production of beer by all member 
brewers when determining eligibility under the 2,000,000 limitation. The 
reduced rate of tax applies to the first 60,000 barrels of beer removed 
for consumption or sale in a calendar year by the controlled group of 
brewers; the controlled group of brewers shall apportion the 60,000 
barrels among member brewers in the manner described in each brewer's 
notice as provided by Sec. 25.167(b)(3).

    Beer may be removed from a brewery for consumption or sale only in 
barrels, kegs, bottles, and similar containers, as provided in this 
part. A container which the appropriate TTB officer determines to be 
similar to a bottle or can will be treated as a bottle for purposes of 
this part. A container which the appropriate TTB officer determines to 
be similar to a barrel or keg and which conforms to one of the sizes 
prescribed for barrels or kegs in Sec. 25.156

[[Page 708]]

<R05>
Sec. 25.156  Determination of tax on keg beer.

    (a) In determining the tax on beer removed in kegs, a barrel is 
regarded as a quantity of not more than 31 gallons. The authorized 
fractional parts of a barrel are whole barrels, halves, thirds, 
quarters, sixths, and eighths, and beer may be removed in kegs rated at 
those capacities. The following keg sizes are also authorized at the 
stated barrel equivalents:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                Barrel

30 liter...................................................      0.25565
50 liter...................................................      0.42608
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) If any barrel or authorized size keg contains a quantity of beer 
more than 2 percent in excess of its rated capacity, tax will be 
determined and paid on the actual quantity of beer (without benefit of 
any tolerance) contained in the keg.
    (c) The quantities of keg beer removed subject to tax will be 
computed to 5 decimal places. The sum of the quantities computed for any 
one day will be rounded to 2 decimal places and the tax will be 
calculated and paid on the rounded sum.

Sec. 25.159  Time of tax determination and payment; offsets.

    (a) Time and payment. The tax on beer will be determined at the time 
of its removal for consumption or sale, and will be paid by return as 
provided in this part.
    (b) Offsets. During any business day, the quantity of beer returned 
to the same brewery from which removed is to be taken as an offset 
against or deducted from the total quantity of beer removed for 
consumption or sale from that brewery on the day that the beer is 
returned.
    (c) Offsets not allowed. An offset or deduction for returned beer 
will not be allowed if:
    (1) The brewer was indemnified by insurance or otherwise in respect 
of the tax; or
    (2) The brewer does not issue credit to the customer for the tax on 
the returned beer within 30 days of the return of the beer. If the tax 
is not timely credited after the offset or deduction is taken, the 
brewer shall make an increasing adjustment on the next tax return.

Sec. 25.160  Tax adjustment for brewers who produce more than 2,000,000
barrels of beer.

    Each brewer who has paid tax on beer by return, Form 5000.24, at the 
reduced rate of tax during a calendar year, but whose production (or the 
production of a controlled group of brewers of which the brewer is a 
member) exceeds 2,000.000 barrels of beer in that calendar year, is no 
longer eligible to pay tax on beer at the reduced rate of tax for any 
beer removed that calendar year for comsumption or sale. The brewer 
shall make a tax adjustment for the payment of additional tax no later 
than the return period in which production (or the production of a 
controlled group of brewers of which the brewer is a member) exceeds 
2,000,000 barrels of beer. The adjustment will be determined by 
multiplying the difference between the higher and lower rates of tax 
applicable to beer by the number of barrels removed by the brewer that 
year at the reduced rate of tax. The brewer shall make tax adjustments 
for all breweries where tax was paid at the lower rate that year, and 
shall include interest payable from the date on which tax was paid at 
the lower rate. In the case of a controlled group of brewers whose 
production exceeds 2,000,000 barrels of beer, all member brewers who 
paid tax at the lower rate shall make tax adjustments as determined in 
this section.

provided in Sec. Sec. 25.164, 25.164a, 25.173, and 25.175. The brewer 
shall pay the tax by remittance at the time the tax return is rendered, 
and the remittance will be by check or money order payable to the 
``Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms'' and mailed with the return, 
or will be effected by an electronic fund transfer. In paying the tax, a 
fractional part of a cent will be disregarded unless it amounts to one-
half cent or more, in which case it will be increased to one cent.

<R05>
Sec. 25.164  Quarterly and semimonthly returns.

    (a) Requirement for filing. Each brewer shall pay the tax on beer 
(unless prepaid) by return on Form 5000.24. The brewer shall file Form 
5000.24 as a return regardless of whether tax has been prepaid as 
provided in Sec. 25.175 during the return period. The brewer shall file 
a return on Form 5000.24 for each return period even though no beer was 
removed for consumption or sale.
    (b) Payment of tax. The brewer shall include for payment with the 
return the full amount of tax required to be determined (and which has 
not been

[[Page 710]]

prepaid) on all beer removed for consumption or sale during the period 
covered by the return.
    (c) Return periods. --(1) Semimonthly return period. Except in the 
case of a taxpayer who qualifies for, and chooses to use, quarterly 
return periods as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, all 
taxpayers must use semimonthly return periods for deferred payment of 
tax. The semimonthly return periods run from the brewer's business day 
beginning on the first day of each month through the brewer's business 
day beginning on the 15th day of that month, and from the brewer's 
business day beginning on the 16th day of the month through the brewer's 
business day beginning on the last day of the month, except as otherwise 
provided in Sec. 25.164a.
    (2) Quarterly return period. A taxpayer may choose to use a 
quarterly return period if the taxpayer was not liable for more than 
$50,000 in taxes with respect to beer imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5051 and 7652 
in the preceding calendar year and if that taxpayer reasonably expects 
to be liable for not more than $50,000 in such taxes during the current 
calendar year. In such a case the last day for paying the tax and filing 
the return shall be the 14th day after the last day of the calendar 
quarter. However, the taxpayer may not use the quarterly return period 
procedure for any portion of the calendar year following the first date 
on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the taxpayer during the 
calendar year exceeds $50,000, and any tax that has not been paid on 
that date shall be due on the 14th day after the last day of the 
semimonthly period in which that date occurs. The following additional 
rules apply to the quarterly return period procedure under this section:
    (i) A ``taxpayer'' is an individual, corporation, partnership, or 
other entity that is assigned a single Employer Identification Number as 
defined in 26 CFR 301.7701-12;
    (ii) ``Reasonably expects'' means that there is no existing or 
anticipated circumstance known to the taxpayer (such as an increase in 
production capacity) that would cause the taxpayer's tax liability to 
exceed the prescribed limit;
    (iii) A taxpayer with multiple locations must combine the beer tax 
liability for all locations to determine eligibility for the quarterly 
return procedure;
    (iv) A taxpayer who has both domestic operations and import 
transactions must combine the beer tax liability on the domestic 
operations and the imports to determine eligibility for the quarterly 
return procedure;
    (v) The controlled group rules of 26 U.S.C. 5061(e), which concern 
treatment of controlled groups as one taxpayer, do not apply for 
purposes of determining eligibility for the quarterly return procedure. 
However, a taxpayer who is eligible for the quarterly return procedure, 
and who is a member of a controlled group that owes $5 million or more 
in beer excise taxes per year, is required to pay taxes by electronic 
fund transfer (EFT). Quarterly payments via EFT shall be transmitted in 
accordance with section 5061(e);
    (vi) A new taxpayer is eligible to file quarterly returns in the 
first year of business simply if the taxpayer reasonably expects to be 
liable for not more than $50,000 in beer taxes during that calendar 
year; and
    (vii) If a taxpayer filing quarterly exceeds $50,000 in tax 
liability during a taxable year and therefore must revert to the 
semimonthly return procedure, that taxpayer may resume quarterly 
payments only after a full calendar year has passed during which the 
taxpayer's liability did not exceed $50,000.
    (d) Time for filing returns and paying tax. Except as otherwise 
provided in Sec. 25.164a for semimonthly tax returns, the brewer shall 
file the tax return, TTB F 5000.24, for each return period, and make 
remittance as required by this section, not later than the 14th day 
after the last day of the return period. If the due date falls on a 
Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the return and remittance are due on

with remittance as provided for in this section, or without remittance 
as provided for in Sec. 25.165, the date of the official postmark of 
the United States Postal Service stamped on the cover in which the

on the brewer to prove when the postmark was made.
    (2) When the brewer sends the semimonthly or quarterly return with

Sec. 25.164a  Special September rule for taxes due by semimonthly return.

    (a) Division of second semimonthly period.-- (1) General. Except as 
otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the second 
semimonthly period for the month of September is divided into two 
payment periods, from the 16th day through the 26th day, and from the 
27th day through the 30th day. The brewer shall file a return, TTB F 
5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 16-26, no later 
than September 29. The brewer shall file a return on TTB F 5000.24, and 
make remittance, for the period September 27-30, no later than October 
14.
    (2) Taxpayment not by electronic fund transfer. In the case of taxes 
for which remittance by electronic fund transfer (EFT) is not required 
by Sec. 25.165, the second semimonthly period of September is divided 
into two payment periods, from the 16th day through the 25th day, and 
from the 26th day through the 30th day. The brewer shall file a return 
on TTB F 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 16-25, 
no later than September 28. The brewer shall file a return on TTB F 
5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 26-30, no later 
than October 14.
    (b) Amount of payment--Safe harbor rule.-- (1) General. Taxpayers 
are considered to have met the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section if the amount paid no later than September 29 is not less than 
11/15ths (73.3 percent) of the tax liability incurred for the 
semimonthly period beginning on September 1 and ending on September 15, 
and if any underpayment of tax is paid by October 14.
    (2) Taxpayment not by EFT. Taxpayers are considered to have met the 
requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section if the amount paid no 
later than September 28 is not less than 2/3rds (66.7 percent) of the 
tax liability incurred for the semimonthly period beginning on September 
1 and ending on September 15, and if any underpayment of tax is paid by 
October 14.
    (c) Weekends and holidays. If the required taxpayment due date for 
the period September 16-25 or September 16-26, as applicable, falls on a 
Saturday or legal holiday, the return and remittance are due on the 
immediately preceding day. If the required due date falls on a Sunday, 
the return and remittance are due on the immediately following day.
    (d) Example: Payment of tax for the month of September.-- (1) Facts. 
X, a brewer required to pay taxes by electronic fund transfer, incurred 
tax liability in the amount of $30,000 for the first semimonthly period 
of September. For the period September 16-26, X incurred tax liability 
in the amount of $45,000, and for the period September 27-30, X incurred 
tax liability in the amount of $2,000.
    (2) Payment requirement. X's payment of tax in the amount of $30,000 
for the first semimonthly period of September is due no later than 
September 29

[[Page 712]]

(Sec. 25.164(d)). X's payment of tax for the period September 16-26 is 
also due no later than September 29 (Sec. 25.164a(a)(1)). X may use the 
safe harbor rule to determine the amount of payment due for the period 
of September 16-26 (Sec. 25.164a(b)). Under the safe harbor rule, X's 
payment of tax must not be less than $21,990.00, that is, 11/15ths of 
the tax liability incurred during the first semimonthly period of 
September. Additionally, X must pay the tax in the amount of $2,000 for 
the period September 27-30 no later than October 14 (Sec. 
25.164a(a)(1)). X must also pay the underpayment of tax, $23,010.00, for 
the period September 16-26, no later than October 14 (Sec. 25.164a(b)).

    Effective Date Note: By T.D. TTB-89, 76 FR 3512, Jan. 20, 2011, 
Sec. 25.164a was revised, effective Feb. 22, 2011 to Feb. 24, 2014.


<R05>
Sec. 25.165  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.

    (a) Eligible brewers. (1) Each taxpayer who was liable, during a 
calendar year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million 
dollars in beer taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part 
and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter, shall use a commerical bank in 
making payment by electronic fund transfer (EFT) of beer taxes during 
the succeeding calendar year. Payment of beer taxes by cash, check, or 
money order, as described in Sec. 25.163, is not authorized for a 
taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances by EFT. For 
purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is defined 
as the gross tax liability on all taxable removals, determined in 
accordance with Sec. 25.159, and importations (including beer brought 
into the United States from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) during 
the calendar year, without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, 
for all premises from which such activities are conducted by the 
taxpayer. Overpayments are not taken into account in summarizing the 
gross tax liability.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and 
implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except 
that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall be replaced by the words 
``more than 50 percent'' in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 
26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the 
rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar 
fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole 
proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a 
group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one 
taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make 
remittances by EFT.
    (3) A taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances 
by EFT shall make a separate EFT remittance and file a separate return, 
Form 5000.24, for each brewery from which beer is removed upon 
determination of tax.
    (b) Requirements. (1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, 
except for a taxpayer already remitting the tax by EFT, each taxpayer 
who was liable for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million 
dollars in beer taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part 
and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter, during the previous calendar year, 
shall notify, in writing the appropriate TTB officer. The notice shall 
be an agreement to make remittances by EFT.
    (2) For each return filed in accordance with this part, the taxpayer 
shall direct the taxpayer's bank to make an electronic fund transfer in 
the amount of the taxpayment to the Treasury Account as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section. The request shall be made to the bank 
early enough for the transfer to be made to the Treasury Account by no 
later than the close of business on the last day for filing the return, 
prescribed in Sec. Sec. 25.164 or 25.175. The request shall take into 
account any time limit established by the bank.
    (3) If a taxpayer was liable for less than five million dollars in 
beer taxes during the preceding calendar year, combining tax liabilities 
incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter, the 
taxpayer may choose either to continue remitting the tax as provided in 
this section or to remit the tax with the return as prescribed by

[[Page 713]]

Sec. 25.164. Upon filing the first return on which the taxpayer chooses 
to discontinue remitting the tax by EFT and to begin remitting the tax 
with the tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the appropriate TTB 
officer by attaching a written notification to Form 5000.24, stating 
that no taxes are due by EFT because the tax liability during the 
preceding calendar year was less than five million dollars, and that the 
remittance will be filed with the tax return.
    (c) Remittance. (1) Each taxpayer shall show on the return, Form 
5000.24, information about remitting the tax for that return by EFT and 
shall file the return with TTB, in accordance with the instructions on 
Form 5000.24.
    (2) Remittances shall be considered as made when the taxpayment by 
electronic fund transfer is received by the Treasury Account. For 
purposes of this section, a taxpayment by electronic fund transfer shall 
be considered as received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a 
Federal Reserve Bank.
    (3) When the taxpayer directs the bank to effect an electronic fund 
transfer message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any 
transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer, through normal banking 
procedures, will serve as the record of payment, and will be retained as 
part of required records.
    (d) Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT. The taxpayer is subject to 
a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5684, 6651, or 6656, as applicable, for 
failure to make a taxpayment by EFT on or before the close of business 
on the prescribed last day for filing.
    (e) Procedure. Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will issue to the taxpayer 
a TTB Procedure entitled ``Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer.'' 
This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer is to follow when 
preparing returns and EFT remittances in accordance with this part. The 
U.S. Customs Service will provide the taxpayer with instructions for 
preparing EFT remittances for payments to be made to the U.S. Customs 
Service.

to the shipping brewery, the brewer is liable under the bond of the 
brewery to which the beer is reconsigned or returned for the tax on beer 
lost in transit.
    (b) Losses allowable without claim. If loss of beer being 
transferred does not exceed two percent of the quantity shipped, the 
brewer is not required to file a report of loss or a claim for allowance 
of the loss if there are no circumstances indicating that the beer, or 
any portion of the beer lost, was stolen or otherwise diverted to an 
unlawful purpose.
    (c) Losses requiring claim. If loss of beer during transit exceeds 
two percent of the quantity shipped, the brewer shall submit a claim 
under penalties of perjury for remission of the tax on the entire loss. 
The brewer shall prepare and submit the claim as provided in Sec. 
25.286.

paid or determined the tax may be returned to any brewery of the brewer. 
Upon return of the beer to the brewery, the brewer shall determine the 
actual quantity of beer received, expressed in barrels. For cases or 
bottles, the label may be used to determine the quantity. When kegs or 
cases containing less than the original contents are received, the 
brewer shall determine the actual quantity of beer by weight or by other

content of returned keg beer unless the keg is equipped with tamper-
proof fittings. The quantity of beer returned may be established by 
weighing individual packages and subtracting package weight, or by 
weighing accumulated beer and subtracting tare weight of dumpsters, 
pallets, packages and the like.
    (b) Disposition of returned beer. The brewer may dispose of beer 
returned under this subpart in any manner prescribed for beer which has 
never left the brewery. If returned beer is again removed for 
consumption or sale, tax will be determined and paid without respect to 
the tax which was determined or paid at the time of prior removal of the 
beer.

removed and beer returned to a brewery different from the one from which 
removed.

shall serially number each notice and execute it under penalties of 
perjury as defined in Sec. 25.11. The brewer must file it with the 
appropriate TTB officer. The notice will contain the following 
information:

commencing on or after October 1, 1993, a brewer who produces less than 
10,000 barrels of beer per calendar year may file the report of brewery 
operations quarterly. The report will be filed on Form 5130.9. For the

quantities of beer produced, water/liquids added in cellars, and beer 
received from other breweries and from pilot brewing

[[Page 732]]

plants for all months of the previous calendar year.
    (2) To begin the quarterly filing of a Brewer's Report of 
Operations, a brewer will state such intent in the ``Remarks'' section 
when filing the last monthly Form 5130.9 before the calendar quarter 
during which the brewer will commence quarterly filings. A brewer 
beginning business may file Form 5130.9 quarterly if the brewer states 
in the ``Remarks'' section of its initial monthly Form 5130.9 that the 
annual production of beer is not likely to exceed 10,000 barrels.
    (3) If a brewer determines that the 10,000 barrel quantity for a 
calendar year will be exceeded in any month, the brewer shall file a 
Form 5130.9 for that month and for all subsequent months of the calendar 
year.
    (4) The appropriate TTB officer may at any time require a brewer who 
is filing a Brewer's Report of Operations quarterly to file such report 
monthly if there is a jeopardy to the revenue.

prepared and kept by the brewer at the brewery where the operation or 
transaction occurs and will be available for inspection by any 
appropriate TTB officer during business hours.
    (b) Reproduction of original records. Whenever any record, because 
of its condition, becomes unsuitable for its intended or continued use, 
the brewer shall reproduce the record by a process under Sec. 25.301. 
The reproduced record will be treated and considered for all purposes as 
though it were the original record, and all provisions of law applicable 
to the original are applicable to the reproduction.
    (c) Retention of records. Records required by this part will be 
preserved for a period of not less than three years from the date 
thereof or the date of the last entry required to be made thereon, 
whichever is later. The appropriate TTB officer may require records to 
be kept for an additional period not exceeding three years in any case 
where such retention is deemed necessary or advisable for the protection 
of the revenue.
    (d) Data Processing. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
section, record data maintained on data processing equipment may be kept 
at a location other than the brewery if the original transaction 
(source) records required by Sec. Sec. 25.292-25.298 are kept available 
for inspection at the brewery.
    (2) Data which has been accumulated on cards, tapes, discs, or other 
accepted record media will be retrievable within five business days.

by this part. Brewers may use any process which accurately reproduces 
the original record and which forms a durable

[[Page 733]]

medium for reproducing and preserving the original record.
    (b) Copies of records treated as original records. Whenever records 
are reproduced under this section, the reproduced records will be 
preserved in conveniently accessible files, and provisions will be made 
for examining, viewing and using the reproduced record the same as if it 
were the original record, and it will be treated and considered for all 
purposes as through it were the original record. All provisions of law 
and regulations applicable to the original are applicable to the 
reproduced record. As used in this section, ``original record'' means 
the record required by this part to be maintained or preserved by the 
brewer, even though it may be an executed duplicate or other copy of the 
document.

<R05>
Sec. 26.31  Formula.

    (a) The amount of excise taxes collected on rum that is imported 
into the United States from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands shall be deposited into the Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the 
Virgin Islands at the rate prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 7652(f). The 
distribution of such amount between Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands 
shall be computed by using permanent base percentages, which represent 
the excise taxes collected on rum brought into the United States from 
Puerto Rico and from the Virgin Islands during fiscal year 1983. The 
base percentages are 87.626889 percent for Puerto Rico and 12.373111 
percent for the Virgin Islands. The formula shall be as follows:

[[Page 740]]

    (1) Take the total amount of excise taxes collected on all rum 
brought or imported into the United States from all areas (including 
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands) during the previous fiscal year 
(October 1-September 30) and multiply that amount by 0.87626889 to 
determine the share of the entire U.S. rum market that will be allotted 
to Puerto Rico and by 0.12373111 to determine the share of the entire 
U.S. rum market that will be allotted to the Virgin Islands;
    (2) Subtract from the share allotted to Puerto Rico under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section the excise taxes collected on rum brought into 
the United States from Puerto Rico during the previous fiscal year, and 
subtract from the share allotted to the Virgin Islands under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section the excise taxes collected on rum imported into 
the United States from the Virgin Islands during the previous fiscal 
year, to determine each possession's loss or gain in excise taxes in 
relation to the previous fiscal year's U.S. rum market. Then divide each 
result by the total excise taxes collected on rum imported into the 
United States during the previous fiscal year from areas other than 
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
    (b) Notwithstanding the formula prescribed in paragraph (a) above, 
the Virgin Islands' share of the excise taxes on rum imported into the 
United States from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands 
shall not exceed 49 percent nor drop below 12.373111 percent. Puerto 
Rico's share of the excise taxes on rum imported into the United States 
from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands shall not 
exceed 87.626889 percent nor drop below 51 percent.
    (c) The percentage for the distribution of the excise taxes 
collected on rum imported into the United States from areas other than 
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, that will be paid over to the 
Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, shall be effective on 
March 1 of each year, and shall remain in effect until March 1 of the 
following year.
    (d) The method for transferring the excise tax collections on rum 
imported from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, into 
the Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands shall be the same 
as the method used for transferring excise taxes into the Treasury of 
Puerto Rico on distilled spirits (with an alcohol content of at least 92 
percent rum) brought into the United States from Puerto Rico.
    (e) The formula prescribed in this section shall take effect on 
March 1, 1987. Prior to that date, Puerto Rico shall continue to receive 
86.4 percent of the eligible excise taxes on rum imported from areas 
other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The Virgin Islands shall 
continue to receive 13.6 percent of these eligible excise taxes until 
March 1, 1987.

Sec. 26.35  Taxable status.

    (a) Liquors coming into the United States from Puerto Rico, except

revenue tax imposed on the production in the United States of like 
liquors. Articles coming into the United States from Puerto Rico, except

therein at the rates imposed in the United States on like liquors of

    (b) The excise taxes collected on distilled spirits or articles 
containing distilled spirits shall be deposited into the Treasury of 
Puerto Rico only if at least 92 percent of the alcoholic content of such 
products is rum. The amount deposited into the Treasury of Puerto Rico 
shall not exceed the lesser of $10.50, or the rate imposed by 26 U.S.C. 
5001(a)(1) (including adjustments to the effective tax rate under 26 
U.S.C. 5010), on each proof gallon of such distilled spirits or 
articles, other than eligible articles, containing distilled spirits 
coming into the United States or consumed on the island. Such excise tax

Sec. 26.79a  Computation of effective tax rate.

    (a) The proprietor shall compute the effective tax rate for 
distilled spirits containing eligible wine or eligible flavors as the 
ratio of the numerator and denominator as follows:
    (1) the numerator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product 
(exclusive of distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors), 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001;

[[Page 750]]

    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5041(b) (1), (2), or 
(3), as applicable; and
    (iii) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits derived from 
eligible flavors used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate 
prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001, but only to the extent that such distilled 
spirits exceed 2\1/2\% of the denominator prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section.
    (2) The denominator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product, 
including distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors; and
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by twice the percentage of alcohol by volume of each, divided 
by 100.
    (b) In determining the effective tax rate, quantities of distilled 
spirits, eligible wine, and eligible flavors will be expressed to the 
nearest tenth of a proof gallon. The effective tax rate may be rounded 
to as many decimal places as the proprietor deems appropriate, provided 
that, such rate is expressed no less exactly than the rate rounded to 
the nearest whole cent, and the effective tax rates for all products 
will be consistently expressed to the same number of decimal places. In 
such case, if the number is less than five it will be dropped; if it is 
five or over, a unit will be added.
    (c) The following is an example of the use of the formula.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Proof gallons by which distilled spirits derived from eligible 
flavors exceed 2\1/2\% of the total proof gallons in the batch (100.9 -

<R05>
Sec. 26.112  Returns for deferred payment of tax.

    (a) Returns. The taxes imposed by 26 U.S.C. 7652(a), (equal to the 
taxes imposed in the United States by 26 U.S.C. 5001(a)(1), 5041, or 
5051), the payment of which has been deferred under the provisions of 
Sec. Sec. 26.80, 26.95 or 26.104 of this part, shall be paid pursuant 
to a return on TTB Form 5000.25 prepared in accordance with the 
instructions on the form.
    (b) Return periods.-- (1) Semimonthly return period. Except in the 
case of a taxpayer who qualifies for, and chooses to use, quarterly 
return periods as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, all 
taxpayers must use semimonthly return periods for deferred payment of 
tax. The semimonthly return periods run from the 1st day through the 
15th day of each month, and from the 16th day through the last day of 
each month, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (2) Quarterly return period. A taxpayer may choose to use a 
quarterly return period if the taxpayer was not liable for more than 
$50,000 in taxes imposed by 26 U.S.C. 7652 in the preceding calendar 
year and if that taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for not more 
than $50,000 in such taxes during the current calendar year. In such a 
case the last day for paying the tax and filing the return shall be the 
14th day after the last day of the calendar quarter. However, the 
taxpayer may not use the quarterly return period procedure for any 
portion of the calendar year following the first date on which the 
aggregate amount of tax due from the

[[Page 757]]

taxpayer during the calendar year exceeds $50,000, and any tax that has 
not been paid on that date shall be due on the 14th day after the last 
day of the semimonthly period in which that date occurs. The following 
additional rules apply to the quarterly return period procedure under 
this section:
    (i) A ``taxpayer'' is an individual, corporation, partnership, or 
other entity that is assigned a single Employer Identification Number as 
defined in 26 CFR 301.7701-12;
    (ii) ``Reasonably expects'' means that there is no existing or 
anticipated circumstance known to the taxpayer (such as an increase in 
production capacity) that would cause the taxpayer's tax liability to 
exceed the prescribed limit;
    (iii) A taxpayer with multiple locations must combine the tax 
liability for all locations with respect to distilled spirits, wine, or 
beer tax liability to determine eligibility for the quarterly return 
procedure;
    (iv) A taxpayer who has both domestic operations and import 
transactions must combine the tax liability on the domestic operations 
and the imports with respect to distilled spirits, wine, or beer tax 
liability to determine eligibility for the quarterly return procedure;
    (v) The controlled group rules of 26 U.S.C. 5061(e), which concern 
treatment of controlled groups as one taxpayer, do not apply for 
purposes of determining eligibility for the quarterly return procedure. 
However, a taxpayer who is eligible for the quarterly return procedure, 
and who is a member of a controlled group that owes $5 million or more 
in distilled spirits, wine, or beer excise taxes per year, is required 
to pay taxes by electronic fund transfer (EFT). Quarterly payments via 
EFT shall be transmitted in accordance with section 5061(e);
    (vi) A new taxpayer is eligible to file quarterly returns in the 
first year of business simply if the taxpayer reasonably expects to be 
liable for not more than $50,000 in distilled spirits, wine, or beer 
taxes during that calendar year; and
    (vii) If a taxpayer filing quarterly exceeds $50,000 in tax 
liability during a taxable year and therefore must revert to the 
semimonthly return procedure, that taxpayer may resume quarterly 
payments only after a full calendar year has passed during which the 
taxpayer's liability did not exceed $50,000.
    (c) Filing. (1) The original of TTB Form 5000.25, with remittance 
covering the full amount of the tax, shall be filed with the appropriate 
TTB officer not later than the 14th day after the last day of the return 
period except as provided by paragraph (d) of this section. If the due 
date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the return and 
remittance are due on the immediately preceding day that is not a 
Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, except as otherwise provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) The tax shall be paid in full by remittance at the time the 
return is filed, unless the proprietor is required to make remittances

semimonthly period beginning on September 1 and ending on September 15, 
and if any underpayment of tax is paid by October 14.
    (ii) Taxpayment not by EFT. Taxpayers are considered to have met the

Saturday or legal holiday, the return and remittance are due on the 
immediately preceding day. If the required due date falls on a Sunday, 
the return and remittance are due on the immediately following day.
    (e) Default. Where a taxpayer has defaulted in any payment of tax 
under this section, during the period of such default and until the 
appropriate TTB officer finds that the revenue will not be jeopardized 
by deferred payment of tax under this section, the tax shall be prepaid 
by such taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 26.113. 
During such period, distilled spirits, wine, or beer shall not be 
released from the proprietor's bonded premises before the proprietor has 
paid the tax thereon. In the event of default, the appropriate TTB 
officer shall immediately notify the Secretary and the revenue agent at 
the premises that tax is to be prepaid until further notice, and upon a 
finding that the revenue will not be jeopardized by resumption of 
deferred payment or tax under this section, the appropriate TTB officer 
shall notify the Secretary and the revenue agent that deferred payment 
may be resumed.

<R05>
Sec. 26.112a  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.

    (a) General. (1) Each taxpayer who was liable, during a calendar 
year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in 
distilled spirits taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this 
part and parts 19 and 27 of this chapter, a gross amount equal to or 
exceeding five million dollars in wine taxes combining tax liabilities 
incurred under this part and parts 24 and 27 of this chapter, or a gross 
amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in beer taxes 
combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 25 and 27 
of this chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by 
electronic fund transfer (EFT) of such taxes during the succeeding 
calendar year. Payment by cash, check, or money order, of distilled 
spirits taxes, wine taxes, or beer taxes, as described in Sec. 26.112, 
is not authorized for a taxpayer who is required, by this section, to 
make remittances by EFT. For purposes of this section, the dollar amount 
of tax liability is to be summarized separately for distilled spirits 
taxes, wine taxes, or beer taxes, and is defined as the gross tax 
liability on each type of product for which taxes

[[Page 759]]

are paid in accordance with this subpart, taxable withdrawals from 
premises in the United States, and importation during the calendar year, 
without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises 
at which tax liabilities are incurred by the taxpayer. Overpayments are 
not taken into account in summarizing the gross tax liability.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and 
implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except 
that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall be replaced by the words 
``more than 50 percent'' in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 
26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the 
rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar 
fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole 
proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a 
group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one 
taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make 
remittances by EFT.
    (3) A taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances 
by EFT, shall make a separate EFT remittance and file a separate tax 
return, for each premises from which distilled spirits, wine, or beer is 
withdrawn upon determination of tax.
    (b) Requirements. (1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, 
except for a taxpayer already remitting the tax by EFT, each taxpayer 
who was liable for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million 
dollars in distilled spirits taxes combining tax liabilities incurred 
under this part and parts 19 and 27 of this chapter, a gross amount 
equal to or exceeding five million dollars in wine taxes combining tax 
liabilities incurred under this part and parts 24 and 27 of this 
chapter, or a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in 
beer taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 
25 and 27 of this chapter during the previous calendar year, shall 
notify, in writing, the appropriate TTB officer. The notice shall be an 
agreement to make remittances by EFT.
    (2) For each return filed in accordance with this part, the taxpayer 
shall direct the taxpayer's bank to make an electronic fund transfer in 
the amount of the taxpayment to the Treasury Account as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section. The request shall be made to the bank 
early enough for the transfer to be made to the Treasury Account by no 
later than the close of business on the last day for filing the return, 
prescribed in Sec. 26.112 or Sec. 26.113. The request shall take into 
account any time limit established by the bank.
    (3) If a taxpayer was liable for less than five million dollars in 
distilled spirits taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this 
part and parts 19 and 27 of this chapter, less than five million dollars 
in wine taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and 
parts 24 and 27 of this chapter, or less than five million dollars in 
beer taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 
25 and 27 of this chapter during the preceding calendar year, the 
taxpayer may choose either to continue remitting the tax as provided in 
this section or to remit the tax with the return as prescribed by Sec. 
26.112. Upon filing the first return on which the taxpayer chooses to 
discontinue remitting the tax by EFT and to begin remitting the tax with 
the tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the appropriate TTB officer by 
attaching a written notification to the tax return, stating that no 
taxes are due by EFT, because the tax liability during the preceding 
calendar year was less than five million dollars, and that the 
remittance shall be filed with the tax return.
    (c) Remittance. (1) Each taxpayer shall show on the tax return, 
information about remitting the tax for that return by EFT and shall 
file the return with the appropriate TTB officer.
    (2) Remittances shall be considered as made when the taxpayment by 
electronic fund transfer is received by the Treasury Account. For 
purposes of this section, a taxpayment by electronic fund transfer shall 
be considered as received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a 
Federal Reserve Bank.

[[Page 760]]

    (3) When the taxpayer directs the bank to effect an electronic fund 
transfer message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any 
transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer, through normal banking 
procedures, will serve as the record of payment, and shall be retained 
as part of required records.
    (d) Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT. The taxpayer is subject to 
a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5684, 6651, or 6656, as applicable, for 
failure to make a taxpayment by EFT on or before the close of business 
on the prescribed last day for filing.
    (e) Procedure. Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will issue to the taxpayer 
a TTB procedure entitled, Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer. 
This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer is to follow when 
preparing returns and EFT remittances in accordance with this part. The 
U.S. Customs Service will provide the taxpayer with instructions for 
preparing EFT remittances for payments to be made to the U.S. Customs 
Service.

Sec. 26.116  Issuance of permit, Form 487B, and customs inspection.

    If the application has been properly executed and the Secretary, or 
his delegate, finds that all internal revenue taxes imposed under 26 
U.S.C. 7652(a), have been computed under the provisions of this part and 
have been paid or, pursuant to a sufficient bond, have been deferred 
under the applicable provisions of this part, he will execute his permit 
on all copies thereof, retain one copy of the form, return two copies to 
the shipper, and send three copies to the district director of customs 
in Puerto Rico. The shipper will submit the two copies of the Form 487B 
to the district director of customs at least six hours prior to the 
intended lading of the merchandise. The district director of customs 
will then inspect the merchandise covered by the Form 487B after which 
he will execute his certificate on each copy of Form 487B indicating all 
exceptions. If discrepancies appear indicating differences between the 
quantity covered by Form 487B and the quantity actually contained in the 
shipment or the improper tax payment of the merchandise, he will 
withhold release of the shipment and notify the Secretary of such 
discrepancies. Thereupon, such discrepancies must be corrected in the 
shipping documents and additional tax paid, if required, prior to 
release of the merchandise. The district director of customs, upon 
release of the merchandise for shipment, will retain one copy of the 
Form 487B, return two copies to the shipper, and send two copies to the 
district director of customs at the port of arrival in the United 
States, one of which should be mailed and the other dispatched on the 
vessel concerned for the guidance of the appropriate TTB officer who 
will handle the cargo. After the shipment has been cleared by the

one copy of the Form 487B and send one copy thereof, with other shipping 
documents, to the district director of customs at the port of arrival.

subparts O or Oa of this part, the tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 7652 which 
provides for a tax equal to the tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5001 will be 
collected on each proof gallon, and fractional part thereof, contained 
in the shipment.
    (b) A credit against the tax imposed on distilled spirits by 26 
U.S.C. 7652 is allowable under 26 U.S.C. 5010 on each proof gallon of 
alcohol derived from eligible wine or from eligible flavors which do not 
exceed 2 \1/2\ percent of the finished product on a proof gallon basis. 
The credit is allowable at the time the tax is payable as if it 
constituted a reduction in the rate of tax.
    (c) Where credit against the tax is desired, the person liable for 
the tax shall establish an effective tax rate in accordance with Sec. 
26.262a. The effective tax rate established will be applied to each 
withdrawal or other disposition of the distilled spirits within the 
United States.

Sec. 26.262a  Computation of effective tax rate.

    (a) The proprietor shall compute the effective tax rate for 
distilled spirits containing eligible wine or eligible flavors as the 
ratio of the numerator and denominator as follows:
    (1) The numerator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product 
(exclusive of distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors), 
multipled by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001;
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5041(b) (1), (2), or 
(3), as applicable; and
    (iii) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits derived from 
eligible flavors used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate 
prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001, but only to the extent that such distilled 
spirits exceed 2\1/2\% of the denominator prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section.
    (2) The denominator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product, 
including distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors; and
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by twice the percentage of alcohol by volume of each, divided 
by 100.
    (b) In determining the effective tax rate, quantities of distilled 
spirits, eligible wine, and eligible flavors will be expressed to the 
nearest tenth of a proof gallon. The effective tax rate may be rounded 
to as many decimal

[[Page 776]]

places as the proprietor deems appropriate, provided that, such rate is 
expressed no less exactly than the rate rounded to the nearest whole 
cent, and the effective tax rates for all products will be consistently 
expressed to the same number of decimal places. In such case, if the 
number is less than five it will be dropped; if it is five or over, a 
unit will be added.
    (c) The following is an example of the use of the formula.

    \1\ Proof gallons by which distilled spirits derived from eligible 
flavors exceed 2\1/2\% of the total proof gallons in the batch (100.9-

Sec. 26.267  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.

    (a) Each person bringing liquors and articles into the United States 
from the Virgin Islands who was liable, during a calendar year, for a 
gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in distilled 
spirits taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and 
parts 19 and 27 of this chapter, a gross amount equal to or exceeding 
five million dollars in wine taxes combining tax liabilities incurred 
under this part and parts 24 and 27 of this chapter, or a gross amount 
equal to or exceeding five million dollars in beer taxes combining tax 
liabilities incurred under this part and parts 25 and 27 of this 
chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic 
fund transfer (EFT), as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, of 
such taxes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of such taxes by 
cash, check, or money order is not authorized for a person bringing 
liquors and articles into the United States from the Virgin Islands who 
is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For purposes 
of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is to be summarized 
separately for distilled spirits taxes, wine taxes, or beer taxes, and 
is defined as the gross tax liability on all taxable withdrawals from 
premises in the United States and importations (including products of 
the same tax class brought into the United States from Puerto Rico or 
the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, without regard to any 
drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such 
activities are conducted.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, a ``person'' includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and 
implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except 
that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall be replaced by the words 
``more than 50 percent'' in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 
26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the 
rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar 
fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole 
proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a 
group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one 
person for the purpose of determining who is required to make 
remittances by EFT.
    (c) Electronic fund transfer or EFT means any transfer of funds, 
other than a transaction originated by check, draft, or similar paper 
instrument, which is initiated through an electronic terminal, 
telephonic instrument, or computer of magnetic tape, so as to order, 
instruct, or authorize a financial institution to either debit or credit 
an account, in accordance with procedures established by the U.S. 
Customs Service.
    (d) Each person who is required by this section to make remittances 
by EFT shall make the EFT remittance in accordance with the requirements 
of the U.S. Customs Service.

Sec. 26.300  General.

    Distilled spirits brought into the United States from the Virgin 
Islands in bulk containers may, under the provisions of this subpart, be 
withdrawn by the proprietor of a distilled spirits plant from customs 
custody and transferred in such bulk containers or by pipeline to the 
bonded premises of his plant, without payment of the internal revenue 
tax imposed on such spirits by 26 U.S.C. 7652. Such spirits so withdrawn 
and transferred to a distilled spirits plant (a) may be redistilled or 
denatured only if 185 degrees or more of proof, and (b) may be withdrawn 
from internal revenue bond for any purpose authorized by 26 U.S.C. 
chapter 51, in the same manner as domestic distilled spirits. Spirits 
transferred from customs custody to the bonded premises of a distilled 
spirits plant under the provisions of this subpart shall be received and 
stored thereat, and withdrawn or transferred therefrom, subject to the 
provisions of part 19 of this chapter. The person operating the bonded 
premises of the distilled spirits plant to which spirits are transferred 
under the provisions of this subpart shall become liable for the tax on 
distilled spirits withdrawn from customs custody under 26 U.S.C. 5232, 
upon release of the spirits from customs custody, and the person 
bringing the spirits into the United States shall thereupon be relieved 
of his liability for such tax.


<R05>
Sec. 26.301  Preparation of transfer record.

    The person bringing spirits into the United States from the Virgin 
Islands under this subpart shall prepare a transfer record, in 
triplicate, according to Sec. 26.273a, and present the record to the

Sec. 26.302  Gauge and certification.

    (a) Gauge. If Virgin Islands spirits to be transferred from customs 
custody to internal revenue bond as provided in this subpart are not 
gauged by an insular gauger at the time of their withdrawal from an 
insular bonded warehouse, as provided in Sec. 26.204 of this chapter, 
the insular consignor shall effect a gauge of each bulk container and 
shall prepare a record of such gauge, in duplicate, and attach both 
copies to the certificate required by Sec. 26.205 of this chapter. If 
the gauge is made by the insular gauger his record of gauge shall be 
prepared in duplicate and both copies shall be attached to the 
certificate.

[[Page 782]]

    (b) Certification. The certification prescribed by Sec. 26.205 of

Sec. 26.303  Customs inspection and release.

    The customs officer shall not release distilled spirits under this 
subpart until he inspects the spirits, and, if it appears that losses in 
transit were sustained from any container, he shall gauge the spirits in 
such container. If the spirits are in a bulk conveyance, the customs 
officer shall record the elements of his gauge on the transfer record, 
or, if the spirits are in packages, on the gauge record required by 
Sec. 26.302, and attach it to the transfer record. The customs officer 
shall also record on the transfer record the port of entry, carrier 
identification, and warehouse entry number. When the consignee has 
complied with all customs requirements, the customs officer shall 
release the spirits for transfer to the distilled spirits plant, by 
dating and signing the transfer record with his title the statement: 
``To the best of my knowledge the information hereon is accurate and the 
spirits are released''. The customs officer shall retain a copy of the 
transfer record and any attachment, forward a copy of the transfer 
record and any attachments to the appropriate TTB officer, and give the 
original of the transfer record with any attachments to the consignee.

    When a shipment of distilled spirits from customs custody to the 
distilled spirits plant is made in a tank, tank barge, cargo container, 
tank car, tank truck, or similar bulk conveyance, all openings affording 
access to the spirits shall be sealed by the customs officer with 
customs seals in such manner as will prevent unauthorized removal of 
spirits through such openings without detection.


<R05>
Sec. 26.305  Receipt by consignee.

    Proprietors of distilled spirits plants who receive Virgin Islands 
spirits under this subpart shall follow the requirements in 27 CFR part 
19 for spirits received by transfer in bond. However, proprietors are 
not required to file application on TTB Form 5100.16 to receive Virgin 
Islands spirits from customs custody.

Sec. 27.40  Distilled spirits.

    (a) A tax is imposed on all distilled spirits in customs bonded 
warehouses or imported into the United States at the rate prescribed by 
26 U.S.C. 5001 on each proof gallon and a proportionate tax at a like 
rate on all fractional parts of each proof gallon. All products of

alcohol derived from eligible wine or from eligible flavors which do not 
exceed 2\1/2\ percent of the finished product on a proof gallon basis. 
The credit is allowable at the time the tax is payable as if it 
constituted a reduction in the rate of tax.

Sec. 27.41  Computation of effective tax rate.

    (a) The proprietor shall compute the effective tax rate for 
distilled spirits containing eligible wine or eligible flavors as the 
ratio of the numerator and denominator as follows:
    (1) The numerator will be the sum of:

[[Page 791]]

    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product 
(exclusive of distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors), 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001;
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5041(b)(1), (2), or 
(3), as applicable; and
    (iii) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits derived from 
eligible flavors used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate 
prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001, but only to the extent that such distilled 
spirits exceed 2\1/2\% of the denominator prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section.
    (2) The denominator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product, 
including distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors; and
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by twice the percentage of alcohol by volume of each, divided 
by 100.
    (b) In determining the effective tax rate, quantities of distilled 
spirits, eligible wine, and eligible flavors will be expressed to the 
nearest tenth of a proof gallon. The effective tax rate may be rounded 
to as many decimal places as the proprietor deems appropriate, provided 
that, such rate is expressed no less exactly than the rate rounded to 
the nearest whole cent, and the effective tax rates for all products 
will be consistently expressed to the same number of decimal places. In 
such case, if the number is less than five it will be dropped; if it is 
five or over, a unit will be added.
    (c) The following is an example of the use of the formula.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Proof gallons by which distilled spirits derived from eligible 
flavors exceed 2\1/2\% of the total proof gallons in the batch (100.9 -

limitation, not to exceed 0.009 gram of carbon dioxide per 100 
milliliters of wine, will be allowed where the amount of carbon dioxide 
in excess of 0.392 gram per 100 milliliters of wine was due to

such taxes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of such taxes by 
cash, check, or money order is not authorized for an importer who is 
required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For purposes of 
this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is to be summarized 
separately for distilled spirits taxes, wine taxes, or beer taxes, and 
is defined as the gross tax liability on all taxable withdrawals from 
premises in the United States and importations (including products of 
the same tax class brought into the United States from Puerto Rico or 
the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, without regard to any 
drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such 
activities are conducted by the taxpayer.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and 
implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except 
that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall be replaced by the words 
``more than 50 percent'' in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 
26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the 
rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar 
fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole 
proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a 
group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one 
taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make 
remittances by EFT.
    (c) Electronic fund transfer or EFT means any transfer of funds, 
other than a transaction originated by check, draft, or similar paper 
instrument, which is initiated through an electronic terminal, 
telephonic instrument, or computer of magnetic tape, so as to order, 
instruct, or authorize a financial institution to either debit or credit 
an account, in accordance with procedures established by the U.S. 
Customs Service.
    (d) An importer who is required by this section to make remittances 
by EFT shall make the EFT remittance in accordance with the requirements 
of the U.S. Customs Service.

    (a) In lieu of preparing a certificate of effective tax rate 
computation each time distilled spirits containing eligible wine or 
eligible flavors are imported as prescribed in Sec. 27.76(c), an 
importer may have a standard effective tax rate established based on the 
least quantity and the lowest alcohol content of eligible wine or 
eligible flavors used in the manufacture of the product.
    (b) To have a standard effective tax rate established, the importer 
shall cause to be submitted to the TTB Alcohol and Tobacco Laboratory, 
6000 Ammendale Road, Ammendale, MD 20705, the following:
    (1) The samples prescribed in Sec. 27.76(b)(1) and an 8-ounce

previously approved standard effective tax rate shall obtain a copy of 
the approval from the person to whom it was issued and, over the 
signature of the importer or other duly authorized person, place the 
following declaration:

I declare under the penalties of perjury that this approval has been 
examined by me and, to best of my knowledge and belief, the standard 
effective tax rate established for this product is applicable to all 
like products contained in this shipment.

    (d) A standard effective tax rate may not be employed until approved 
by the appropriate TTB officer. The importer shall file or furnish a 
copy of the standard effective tax rate approval in the manner 
prescribed in Sec. 27.76(d). The use of a standard effective tax rate 
shall not relieve an importer from the payment of any tax found to be 
due. The appropriate TTB officer may at any time require an importer to 
immediately discontinue the use of a standard effective tax rate.

persons has actual or legal control, directly or indirectly, whether by 
stock ownership or otherwise, of the other or others of such persons, 
and includes a winery's parent or subsidiary or any other entity in 
which the winery's parent or subsidiary has a controlling ownership 
interest. An affiliate also means any one of two or more persons subject 
to common control, actual or legal, directly or indirectly, whether by 
stock ownership or otherwise.
    Importer means any person importing wine who must obtain a permit as 
provided in Sec. 27.55.
    Natural wine means the product of the juice or must of sound, ripe 
grapes or other sound, ripe fruit (including berries) made with any 
cellar treatment authorized by subparts F and L of part 24 of this 
chapter and containing not more than 21 percent by weight (21 degrees 
Brix de-alcoholized wine) of total solids.
    Produced, when used with reference to wine, means removed from the 
fermenter.
    Proper cellar treatment means a production practice or procedure 
authorized by subparts F and L of part 24 of this chapter and, in the 
case of natural wine produced and imported subject to an international 
agreement or treaty, those practices and procedures acceptable to the 
United States under that agreement or treaty.
    (b) Certification--(1) General. Except as otherwise provided in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an importer of natural wine must have 
an original or copy of a certification from the producing country 
stating that the practices and procedures used to produce the imported 
wine constitute proper cellar treatment. The certification:
    (i) Must be from a governmental or government-approved entity having 
oversight or control over enological practices in the producing country 
under the laws of that country;
    (ii) Must include the results of a laboratory analysis of the wine 
conducted

[[Page 800]]

either by a government laboratory of the producing country or by a 
laboratory certified by the government of the producing country; and
    (iii) Must be in the possession of the importer at the time of 
release of the wine from customs custody and may cover multiple 
importations provided that the wine in each case is of the same brand 
and class or type, was made by the same producer, was subjected to the 
same cellar treatment, and conforms to the statements made on the 
certification.
    (2) Alternative certifications and exemptions--(i) The following are 
alternatives to the producing country certification and laboratory 
analysis requirement described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section:
    (A) In the case of natural wine produced and imported subject to an 
international agreement or treaty specifying that the practices and 
procedures used to produce the wine are acceptable to the United States, 
no producing country certification and laboratory analysis is required, 
unless that international agreement or treaty requires a certification, 
in which case the importer must have in his or her possession at the 
time of release of the wine from customs custody an original or copy of 
that certification.
    (B) If an importer of natural wine or its affiliate owns or controls 
a winery operating under a basic permit issued under part 1 of this 
chapter, in lieu of a producing country certification and laboratory 
analysis, the importer may self-certify that the practices and 
procedures used to produce the wine constitute proper cellar treatment. 
The self-certification must be either in the format set forth in 
paragraph (c) of this section with blocks 1 through 4 completed or in an 
alternative format that sets forth the same information, and it must be 
in the possession of the importer at the time of release of the wine 
from customs custody. In the case of self-certification the importer 
also must have at the time of release from customs custody records to 
establish that the requirements for self-certification are met.
    (ii) The following are exempt from any certification requirement 
under this section:
    (A) Natural wine produced before January 1, 2005. However, in this 
case, the importer must have in his or her possession at the time of 
release of the wine from customs custody records to establish that the 
wine was produced before January 1, 2005.
    (B) Importations of natural wine that are of a personal, non-
commercial nature. Examples of non-commercial importations include 
importations by travelers, gift shipments between individuals, and 
importations by diplomats for embassy or consular use.
    (C) Importations of natural wine that constitute commercial samples. 
Commercial samples include sales samples, samples for trade shows, and 
samples for laboratory analysis.
    (D) Imported natural wine held on board international passenger 
carriers, such as cruise ships or airliners.
    (c) Form. The format for certification referred to in paragraph (b) 
of this section is the following:

[[Page 801]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR24AU05.000

    (d) Preparation of Certification. The following rules apply for the 
completion of the certification set forth in paragraph (c) of this 
section:
    (1) Block 1 must state the legal name and address (including 
country) of the producer of the wine.

[[Page 802]]

    (2) Block 2 must include a complete description of the wine, 
including its brand name, year of production, class or type, and country 
of origin.
    (3) The importer must check the applicable box in block 3:
    (i) The importer must check box 3a and ensure that blocks 4 and 5 
are completed if no alternative certification applies to the wine under 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) applies to the wine, the importer 
must check box 3b and complete the certification in block 4.
    (4) If the certification is submitted subsequent to approval of a 
label, the importer must complete block 6 by including the TTB 
identification number from the certificate of label approval, TTB Form 
5100.31.

                   Premises of Distilled Spirits Plant


<R05>
Sec. 27.171  General provisions.

    Imported distilled spirits in bulk containers may, under the 
provisions of this subpart, be withdrawn by the proprietor of a 
distilled spirits plant from customs custody and transferred in such 
bulk containers or by pipeline to the bonded premises of his plant, 
without payment of the internal revenue tax imposed on imported spirits 
by 26 U.S.C. 5001. Imported spirits so withdrawn and transferred to a 
distilled spirits plant (a) may be redistilled or denatured only if of 
185 degrees or more of proof, and (b) may be withdrawn from internal 
revenue bond for any purpose authorized by 26 U.S.C. chapter 51, in the 
same manner as domestic distilled spirits. Imported distilled spirits 
transferred from customs custody to the bonded premises of a distilled 
spirits plant under the provisions of this subpart shall be received and 
stored thereat, and withdrawn or transferred therefrom, subject to the 
applicable provisions of 27 CFR part 19. However, distilled spirits 
plant proprietors are not required to file application on TTB Form 
5100.16 to receive imported spirits from customs custody. The person 
operating the bonded premises of the distilled spirits plant to which 
imported spirits are transferred shall become liable for the tax on 
distilled spirits withdrawn from customs custody under 26 U.S.C. 5232, 
upon release of the spirits from customs custody, and the importer shall 
thereupon be relieved of his liability for such tax.

    The person importing spirits under this subpart shall prepare a 
transfer record according to Sec. 27.138. A separate transfer record 
shall be prepared for each conveyance. If the spirits are in packages he 
shall prepare a package gauge record according to Sec. 27.139 and 
attach it to the transfer record. The transfer record and the package 
gauge record shall be prepared in triplicate, and, upon release of the 
spirits from customs custody one copy will be given to the customs 
officer, one copy will be forwarded to the appropriate TTB officer, and 
the original will be forwarded to the consignee.

Sec. 27.173  Inspection and release.

    The customs officer shall not release distilled spirits under this 
subpart until he inspects the spirits. If it appears that losses in 
transit were sustained from any container, the customs officer shall 
gauge the spirits in such container and enter the elements of gauge on 
the transfer record if the spirits are in a bulk conveyance or on the 
package gauge record if the spirits are in packages. The customs officer 
shall enter on the transfer record the port of entry, carrier 
identification, warehouse entry number, applicable rate of duty, and 
serial number of any customs seals affixed to bulk conveyances. When all

[[Page 803]]

customs requirements are complied with, he shall release the spirits for 
transfer to the distilled spirits plant by dating and signing on the 
transfer with his title the statement: ``To the best of my knowledge the 
information hereon is accurate and the spirits are released.'' The 
original of the transfer record with any attachments shall be retained 
by the consignee.

under this part and part 22 of this chapter, Form 5150.33 may be 
annotated to cover both types of withdrawals.
    (3) A separate permit is not required for each port of entry. The 
application, Form 5150.33, may be completed to indicate the applicable

individually file an application for a permit, Form 5150.33.
    (5) Each application for a permit shall be signed by the head of the 
agency or sub-agency, or the incumbent of an office which is authorized

    (a) Application. An importer who desires to use an alternate method 
or procedure in lieu of a method or procedure prescribed by this part 
must file an application, in triplicate, with the appropriate TTB 
officer. Each application must:
    (1) Specify the name, address, and permit number of the importer to 
which it relates;

procedure is received, the appropriate TTB officer must determine 
whether approval thereof would unduly hinder the effective 
administration of this part or would result in jeopardy to the revenue. 
The appropriate TTB officer may approve the alternate method or 
procedure if such officer finds that:
    (1) Good cause has been shown for the use of the alternate method or 
procedure;
    (2) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and 
consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed 
method or procedure, and affords equivalent security to the revenue; and

received from the appropriate TTB officer. Authorization for the 
alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment 
of the appropriate TTB officer, the revenue is jeopardized or the 
effective administration of this part is hindered by the continuation of 
such authorization.

Sec. 28.22  Vessels employed in the fisheries.

    Liquors may be withdrawn or laden under the provisions of paragraphs 
(b) and (e) of Sec. 28.21 relating to vessels employed in the 
fisheries, only for use on vessels of the United States documented to 
engage in the fisheries and foreign fishing vessels of 5 net tons or 
over if the district director of customs is satisfied by reason of the 
quantity requested in the light of (a) whether the vessel is employed in 
substantially continuous fishing activities, and (b) the vessel's 
complement, that none of the liquors to be withdrawn or laden are 
intended to be removed from the vessel in, or otherwise returned to, the 
United States. Such withdrawal or lading shall be conditioned upon 
compliance with the applicable provisions of this part. Lading of such 
liquors for use on such vessels shall be subject to approval by the 
district director of customs of a special written application by the 
withdrawer or the vessel's master on customs Form 5125 (in duplicate) 
and a statement by the withdrawer in his application or notice on the 
required TTB Form 5100.11, 5110.30, 1582-A (5120.24), 1582-B (5130.6), 
or 1689 (5130.12), as the case may be, that the liquors are

[[Page 814]]

to be laden for use as supplies on a vessel employed in the fisheries. 
The original application on customs Form 5125, after approval, shall be 
stamped with the serial number of the TTB Form 5100.11, 5110.30, 1582-A 
(5120.24), 1582-B (5130.6), or 1689 (5130.12), as the case may be, and 
the date thereof, and shall be returned by the district director of 
customs to the withdrawer or vessel's master for use as prescribed 
below. Approval of each such application shall be subject to the 
condition that the original shall be presented thereafter by the 
withdrawer or the vessel's master to the district director of customs 
within 24 hours (excluding Saturday, Sunday, and holidays) after each 
subsequent arrival of the vessel at a customs port or station and that 
an accounting shall be made at the time of such presentation of the 
disposition of the liquors until the district director of customs is 
satisfied that they have been consumed on board, or landed under customs 
supervision, and takes up the authorization. The approval of customs 
Form 5125 shall be subject to the further condition that any such 
liquors remaining on board while the vessel is in port shall be 
safeguarded in the manner and to such extent as the director of the port 
or place of arrival shall deem necessary. When such liquors have been 
accounted for to the satisfaction of the district director of customs, 
he shall execute his certificate of lading and use on both copies of the 
TTB Form 5100.11, 5110.30, 1582-A (5120.24), 1582-B (5130.6), or 1689 
(5130.12), as the case may be, and forward the original of the form 
according to its instructions. In the event of a failure on the part of 
the withdrawer or the master of the vessel to comply with the conditions 
of this section or upon receipt of evidence that the liquors were not 
lawfully used as supplies on the vessel, the district director of 
customs shall advise the appropriate TTB officer of all the facts in the 
case for determination of any liability incurred. In the case of liquors 
withdrawn without payment of tax, assessment of tax liability found to 
have been incurred shall be made against the principal on the bond. In 
the case of taxpaid or tax determined liquors, the appropriate TTB 
officer shall determine as to whether to make demand upon the principal 
and the surety on the bond or to disallow the claim as the case may be.
    Note: As used in this section, the word ``withdrawer'' shall mean 
the person executing the application or notice, TTB Form 5100.11,

and engaged in foreign trade, privileges substantially reciprocal to the 
privileges allowed herein to aircraft of a foreign country. Where 
application is made to withdraw or lade liquors for use on aircraft of 
other countries, which it is claimed reciprocate similar privileges to 
aircraft of the United States, the applicant must first establish the 
right of such withdrawal or lading. In appropriate cases, the applicant 
should request the Secretary of Commerce to find and advise the 
Secretary of the Treasury that such foreign country or countries allow, 
or will allow, substantially reciprocal privileges to aircraft of the

containers, the serial numbers of the containers (if any), and the 
quantity received, and shall show that the liquors are in customs 
custody and have been or will be laden on board the vessel or aircraft, 
that they will be lawfully used on board the vessel or aircraft, and 
that no portion of the shipment has been or will be unladen in the 
United States or any of its territories or possessions. A receipt is not 
required, in the case of any shipment for use on vessels, when the

                     Subpart A_Scope of Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 30.1  Gauging of distilled spirits.

    (a) General. This part relates to the gauging of distilled spirits. 
The term ``gauging'' means the determination of the proof and the 
quantity of distilled spirits. The procedures prescribed in or 
authorized under the provisions of this part, except as may be otherwise 
authorized in this chapter, shall be followed in making any 
determination of quantity or proof of distilled spirits required by or 
under the authority of regulations in this chapter. The tables referred 
to in subpart E of this part appear in the ``Gauging Manual Embracing 
Instructions and Tables for Determining Quantity of Distilled Spirits by 
Proof and Weight'' as incorporated by reference in this part (see 
paragraph (c) of this section). These tables, together with their 
instructions, shall be used, wherever applicable, in making the 
necessary computations from gauge data.

[[Page 859]]

    (b) Tables referred to in subpart E of this part. Table 1 provides a 
method of correcting hydrometer indications at temperatures between 0 
and 100 degrees Fahrenheit to true proof. If distilled spirits contain 
dissolved solids, temperature correction of the hydrometer reading by 
the use of this table would result in apparent proof rather than true 
proof. Tables 2 and 3 show the gallonage of spirituous liquor according 
to weight and proof. Table 4 shows the gallons per pound at each one-
tenth proof from 1 to 200 proof. Table 5 shows the weight per wine 
gallon and proof gallon at each proof. Table 6 shows the volumes of 
alcohol and water and the specific gravity (air and vacuum) of 
spirituous liquor at each proof. Table 7 provides a means of 
ascertaining the volume (at 60 degree Fahrenheit) of spirits at various 
temperatures ranging from 18 degrees through 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
    (c) Incorporation by reference. The ``Gauging Manual Embracing 
Instructions and Tables for Determining Quantity of Distilled Spirits by 
Proof and Weight'' (Publication 5110.6; November 1978) is incorporated 
by reference in this part. This incorporation by reference was approved 
by the Director of the Federal Register on March 23, 1981. This 
publication may be inspected at the National Archives and Records 
Administration (NARA), and is available from the Superintendent of

described in Sec. 30.22.
    (c) Appropriate TTB officers. Appropriate TTB officers shall use 
only hydrometers and thermometers furnished by the Government. However, 
where this part requires the use of a specific gravity hydrometer, TTB 
officers shall use precision grade specific gravity hydrometers 
conforming to the provisions of Sec. 30.24, furnished by the 
proprietor. However, the appropriate TTB officer may authorize the use 
of other instruments approved by the appropriate TTB officer as being 
equally satisfactory for determination of specific gravity and for 
gauging. From time to time appropriate TTB officers shall verify the 
accuracy of hydrometers and thermometers used by proprietors.

Sec. 30.22  Hydrometers and thermometers.

    The hydrometers used are graduated to read the proof of aqueous 
alcoholic solutions at 60 degrees Fahrenheit; thus, they read, 0 for 
water, 100 for proof spirits, and 200 for absolute alcohol. Because of 
temperature-density relationships and the selection of 60 degrees 
Fahrenheit for reporting proof, the hydrometer readings will be less 
than the true percent of proof at temperatures below 60 degrees 
Fahrenheit and greater than the true percent of proof at temperatures 
above 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Hence, corrections are necessary for 
hydrometer readings at temperatures other than 60 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Precision hydrometers shall be used for gauging spirits. Hydrometers and 
thermometers shall be used and the true percent of proof shall be 
determined in accordance with Sec. 30.31. Hydrometers are designated by 
letter according to range of proof and are provided in ranges and 
subdivisions of stems as follows:

Sec. 30.23  Use of precision hydrometers and thermometers.

    Care should be exercised to obtain accurate hydrometer and 
thermometer readings. In order to accomplish this result, the following 
precautions should be observed. Bulk spirits should be thoroughly 
agitated so that the test samples will be representative of the entire 
quantity. The hydrometers should be kept clean and free of any oily 
substance. Immediately before readings are taken, the glass cylinder 
containing the thermometer should be rinsed several times with the 
spirits which are to be gauged so as to bring both the cylinder and the 
thermometer to the temperature of the spirits (if time permits, it is 
desirable to bring both the spirits and the instruments to room 
temperature). If the outer surface of the cylinder becomes wet, it 
should be wiped dry to avoid the cooling effect of rapid evaporation. 
During the readings the cylinder should be protected from drafts or 
other conditions which might affect its temperature or that of the 
spirits which it contains. The hands should not be placed on the 
cylinder in such a manner as to warm the liquid contained therein. The 
hydrometer should be inserted in the liquid and the hydrometer bulb 
raised and lowered from top to bottom 5 or 6 times to obtain an even 
temperature distribution over its surface, and, while the hydrometer 
bulb remains in the liquid, the stem should be dried and the hydrometer 
allowed to come to rest without wetting more than a few tenths degrees 
of the exposed stem. Special care should be taken to ascertain the exact 
point at which the level of the surface liquid intersects the scale of 
proof in the stem of the hydrometer. The hydrometer and thermometer 
should be immediately read, as nearly simultaneously as possible. In 
reading the hydrometer, a sighting should be made slightly below the 
plane of the surface of the liquid and the line of sight should then be 
raised slowly, being kept perpendicular to the hydrometer stem, until 
the appearance of the surface changes from an ellipse to a straight 
line. The point where this line intersects the hydrometer scale is the 
correct reading of the hydrometer. When the correct readings of the 
hydrometer and the thermometer have been determined, the true percent of 
proof shall be ascertained from Table 1. Another sample of the spirits 
should then be taken and be tested in the same manner so as to verify 
the proof originally ascertained. Hydrometer readings should be made to 
the nearest 0.05 degree and thermometer readings should be made to the 
nearest 0.1 degree, and instrument correction factors, if any, should be 
applied. It is necessary to interpolate in Table 1 for fractional 
hydrometer and thermometer readings.

    Example. A hydrometer reads 192.85[deg] at 72.10 [deg]F. The 
correction factors for the hydrometer and the thermometer, respectively 
are minus0.03[deg] and plus0.05[deg]. The corrected reading, then, is 
192.82[deg] at 72.15 [deg]F.

From Table 1:
193.0[deg] at 72.0 [deg]F.                                   =  190.2[de
                                                                      g]
192.0[deg] at 72.0 [deg]F.                                   =  189.1[de
                                                                      g]
                                                           -------------
    Difference                                               =  1.1[deg]
192.0[deg] at 72.0 [deg]F.                                   =  189.1[de
                                                                      g]
192.0[deg] at 73.0 [deg]F.                                   =  188.9[de
                                                                      g]
                                                           -------------
    Difference                                               =  0.2[deg]
 

    The hydrometer difference (1.1[deg]) multiplied by the fractional 
degree of the hydrometer reading (0.82[deg])=0.902.
    The temperature difference (0.2[deg]) multiplied by the fractional 
degree of the temperature reading (0.15[deg])=0.03[deg].
Proof at 60 [deg]F.=189.1+0.902-0.03=189.972[deg]=190.0[deg].
    As shown, the final proof is rounded to the nearest tenth of a 
degree of proof. In such cases, if the hundredths decimal is less than 
five, it will be dropped; if it is five or over, a unit will be added.

Sec. 30.25  Use of precision specific gravity hydrometers.

    The provisions of Sec. 30.23 respecting the care, handling, and use 
of precision instruments shall be followed with respect to the care, 
handling, and use of precision grade specific gravity hydrometers. 
Specific gravity hydrometers shall be read to the nearest subdivision. 
Because of temperature density relationships and the selection of the 
standardization temperature of 60 [deg]/60 [deg]F., the specific gravity 
readings will be greater at temperatures below 60 degrees Fahrenheit and 
less at temperatures above 60 degress Fahrenheit. Hence, correction of 
the specific gravity readings will be made for temperature other than 60 
degrees Fahrenheit. Such correction may be ascertained by dividing the 
specific gravity hydrometer reading by the applicable correction factor 
in Table 7.

    Example: The specific gravity hydrometer reading is 1.1525, the 
thermometer reading is 68 degrees Fahrenheit, and the true proof of the 
spirits is 115 degrees. The correct specific gravity reading will be 
ascertained as follows:
    (a) From Table 7, the correction factor for 115[deg] proof at 68 
[deg]F. is 0.996.
    (b) 1.1525 divided by 0.996=1.1571, the corrected specific gravity.

Sec. 30.31  Determination of proof.

    (a) General. The proof of spirits shall be determined to the nearest 
tenth degree which shall be the proof used in determining the proof 
gallons.
    (b) Solids content not more than 600 milligrams. Except as otherwise 
authorized by the appropriate TTB officer, the proof of spirits 
containing not more than 600 milligrams of solids per 100 milliliters of 
spirits shall be determined by the use of a hydrometer and thermometer 
in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 30.23 except that if such 
spirits contain solids in excess of 400 milligrams but not in excess of 
600 milligrams per 100 milliliters at gauge proof, there shall be added 
to the proof so determined the obscuration determined as prescribed in 
Sec. 30.32.
    (c) Solids content over 600 milligrams. If such spirits contain 
solids in excess of 600 milligrams per 100 milliliters at gauge proof, 
the proof shall be determined on the basis of true proof determined as 
follows:
    (1) By the use of a hydrometer and a thermometer after the spirits 
have been distilled in a small laboratory still and restored to the 
original volume and temperature by the addition of pure water to the 
distillate; or
    (2) By a recognized laboratory method which is equal or superior in 
accuracy to the distillation method.

[[Page 863]]

    (d) Initial proof. Except when the proof of spirits is used in 
making the guage prescribed in Sec. 19.353 of this chapter or in making 
a gauge for determination of tax, the initial determination of proof 
made on the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant for such 
spirits may be used whenever a subsequent gauge is required to be made 
at that same plant provided that no material has been added to change 
the proof of the spirits.

Sec. 30.32  Determination of proof obscuration.

    (a) General. Proof obscuration of spirits containing more than 400 
but not more than 600 milligrams of solids per 100 milliliters shall be 
determined by one of the following methods. The evaporation method may 
be used only for spirits in the range of 80-100 degrees at gauge proof.
    (b) Evaporation method. Evaporate the water and alcohol from a 
carefully measured 25 milliliter sample of spirits, dry the residue at 
100 degrees centigrade for 30 minutes and then weigh the residue 
precisely. Multiply the weight of the residue by 4 to determine the 
weight of solids in 100 milliliters. The resulting weight per 100 
milliliters multiplied by 4 will give the obscuration. Experience has 
shown that 0.1 gram (100 milligrams) of solids per 100 milliliters of 
spirits in the range of 80-100 degrees proof will obscure the true proof 
by 0.4 of one degree of proof. For example, if the weight of solids 
remaining after evaporation of 25 milliliters 0.125 gram, the amount of 
solids present in 100 milliliters of the spirits is 0.50 gram (4 times 
0.125). The obscuration is 4 times 0.50, which is two degrees of proof. 
This value added to the temperature corrected hydrometer reading will 
give the true proof.
    (c) Distillation method. Determine the apparent proof and 
temperature of the sample of spirits and then distill a carefully 
measured sample in a small laboratory still, and collect a quantity of 
the distillate, 1 or 2 milliliters less than the original sample. The 
distillate is adjusted to the original temperature and restored to the 
original volume by addition of distilled water. The proof of the 
restored distillate is then determined by use of a precision hydrometer 
and thermometer in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 30.23 to the 
nearest 0.1 degree of proof. The difference between the proof so 
determined and the apparent proof of the undistilled sample is the 
obscuration; or
    (d) Pycnometer method. Determine the specific gravity of the 
undistilled sample, distill and restore the samples as provided in 
paragraph (c) of this section and determine the specific gravity of the 
restored distillate by means of a pycnometer. The specific gravities so 
obtained will be converted to degrees of proof by interpolation of Table 
6 to the nearest 0.1 degree of proof. The difference in proof so 
obtained is the obscuration.

                   Determination of Quantity by Weight


<R05>
Sec. 30.41  Bulk spirits.

    When spirits (including denatured spirits) are to be gauged by 
weight in bulk quantities, the weight shall be determined by means of 
weighing tanks,

[[Page 864]]

mounted on accurate scales. Before each use, the scales shall be 
balanced at zero load; thereupon the spirits shall be run into the 
weighing tank and proofed as prescribed in Sec. 30.31. However, if the 
spirits are to be reduced in proof, the spirits shall be so reduced 
before final determination of the proof. The scales shall then be 
brought to a balanced condition and the weight of the spirits determined 
by reading the beam to the nearest graduation mark. From the weight and 
the proof thus ascertained, the quantity of the spirits in proof gallons 
shall be determined by reference to Table 4. However, in the case of 
spirits which contain solids in excess of 600 milligrams per 100 
milliliters, the quantity in proof gallons shall be determined by first 
ascertaining the wine gallons per pound of the spirits and multiplying 
the wine gallons per pound by the weight, in pounds, of the spirits 
being gauged and by the true proof (determined as prescribed in Sec. 
30.31) and dividing the result by 100. The wine gallons per pound of 
spirits containing solids in excess of 600 milligrams per 100 
milliliters shall be ascertained by:
    (a) Use of a precision hydrometer and thermometer, in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 30.23, to determine the apparent proof of 
the spirits (if specific gravity at the temperature of the spirits is 
not more than 1.0) and reference to Table 4 for the wine gallons per 
pound, or
    (b) Use of a specific gravity hydrometer, in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 30.25, to determine the specific gravity of the 
spirits (if the specific gravity at the temperature of the spirits is 
more than 1.0) and dividing that specific gravity (corrected to 60 
degrees Fahrenheit) into the factor 0.120074 (the wine gallons per pound 
for water at 60 degrees Fahrenheit). When withdrawing a portion of the 
contents of a weighing tank, the difference between the quantity 
(ascertained by proofing and weighing) in the tank immediately before 
the removal of the spirits and the quantity (ascertained by proofing and 
weighing) in the tank immediately after the removal of the spirits shall 
be the quantity considered to be withdrawn.

<R05>
Sec. 30.42  Denatured spirits.

    The quantity, in gallons, of any lot or package of specially 
denatured spirits may be determined by weighing it and then dividing its 
weight by the weight per gallon of the formula concerned, as given in 
the appropriate tables in subpart H of 27 CFR Part 21. In the case of 
completely denatured spirits, the gallonage of any lot or package may be 
ascertained by determining its weight and apparent proof (hydrometer 
indication, corrected to 60 degrees Fahrenheit) and then multiplying the 
weight of the wine gallons per pound factor shown in Table 4 for the 
(apparent) proof.

Sec. 30.43  Packaged spirits.

    When the quantity of spirits (including denatured spirits when 
gauged by weight) in packages, such as barrels, drums, and similar 
portable containers, is to be determined by gauge of the individual 
packages, such quantity shall, except as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section, be determined by weighing each package on an accurate 
weighing beam or platform scale having a beam or dial showing weight in 
pounds and half pounds, where packages having a capacity in excess of 10 
wine gallons are to be gauged, or in pounds and ounces, or pounds and 
hundredths of a pound, where packages designed to hold 10 wine gallons 
or less are to be gauged. In either case the tare must be determined and 
subtracted from the gross weight to obtain the net weight. From the 
proof and weight ascertained, the quantity of the spirits in proof 
gallons shall be determined by reference to Table 2, 3, or 4. However, 
if the spirits contain solids in excess of 600 milligrams per 100 
milliliters, the proof gallons shall be determined as prescribed for 
such spirits in Sec. 30.41. Notwithstanding the provisions of this 
section or of Sec. 30.44, (a) gross weights and tares of packages being 
filled need not be taken in any case where the gauge of

[[Page 865]]

the spirits is not derived from such weights under the gauging procedure 
being utilized, and (b) meters, other devices, or other methods may be 
used for determining the quantity of spirits in individual packages, 
when such meter is used as provided in 27 CFR Part 19, or, when such 
other device or method has been approved by the appropriate TTB officer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Containers of other proofs or sizes. Where containers of proofs 
or sizes not shown above are to be filled, the following rule may be 
used for ascertaining the weight of the spirits to be placed in the 
container: Divide the number of gallons representing the quantity of 
spirits to be placed in the container by the fractional part of a gallon 
equivalent to 1 pound, to obtain the weight of the spirits in pounds and 
fractions of a pound to two decimal places. Reduce the decimal fraction 
of a pound to ounces by multiplying by 16, calling any fraction of an 
ounce a whole ounce. The pounds and ounces thus obtained will determine 
the point to which the spirits must be weighed to produce the results 
desired. If the weight must be marked on the container in pounds and 
decimal fractions of a pound, it will be necessary to convert the ounces 
to hundredths of a pound. The fraction of a gallon equivalent to 1 pound 
at any given proof shall be ascertained by reference to Table 4. 
However, if the spirits contain solids in excess of 600 milligrams per 
100 milliliters, the fraction of a gallon equivalent to 1 pound shall be 
determined as prescribed for such spirits in Sec. 30.41.

    Example. It is desired to fill a 1-gallon can with precisely 1 wine 
gallon of 194 proof spirits:
1.00 divided by 0.14866=6.73 pounds.
0.73 multiplied by 16=11.68 ounces, rounded to 12 ounces.
Weight of spirits--6 pounds, 12 ounces.
Weight, if required, to be marked on can-6.75 pounds.

<R05>
Sec. 30.45  Withdrawal gauge for packages.

    When wooden packages are to be individually gauged for withdrawal, 
actual tare of the packages shall be determined. The actual tare of a 
package shall be determined by weighing it after its contents (including 
rinse water, if any) have been temporarily removed to a separate 
container or vessel. Where the contents of packages have been 
temporarily removed for determination of tare, the proof, if any rinse 
water is added to the spirits, shall be determined after a thorough

[[Page 866]]

mixing of the rinse water and the spirits and before return of the 
spirits to the rinsed packages, and the gross weight shall be determined 
after the spirits and any added rinse water have been returned to the 
packages. In the case of metal packages the tare established at the time 
of filling may be used unless it appears to be incorrect. From the 
proofs and the net weights of the packages, the wine gallons (if 
desired) and the proof gallons of spirits shall be determined by the use 
of Table 2. However, if the spirits contain solids in excess of 600 
milligrams per 100 milliliters, the wine gallon and proof gallon 
contents shall be determined as prescribed for such spirits in Sec. 
30.41. If either the weight or the proof is beyond the limitations of 
table 2, either table 3 or table 4 may be used.

                   Determination of Quantity by Volume


<R05>
Sec. 30.51  Procedures for measurement of bulk spirits.

    Where the quantity of spirits (including denatured spirits) in bulk 
is to be determined by volume as authorized by this chapter, the 
measurement shall be made in tanks, by meters as provided in 27 CFR part 
19, or by other devices or methods authorized by the appropriate TTB 
officer, or as otherwise provided in this chapter, or such measurement 
may be made in tank cars or tank trucks if calibration charts for such 
conveyances are provided and such charts have been accurately prepared, 
and certified as accurate, by engineers or other persons qualified to 
calibrate such conveyances. Volumetric measurements in tanks shall be 
made only in accurately calibrated tanks equipped with suitable 
measuring devices, whereby the actual contents can be correctly 
ascertained. If the temperature of spirits (including denatured spirits) 
is other than the standard of 60 degrees Fahrenheit, gallonage 
determined by volumetric measurements shall be corrected to the standard 
temperature by means of table 7. In the case of denatured spirits, the 
temperature-correction factor for the proof of the spirits used in 
denaturation will give sufficiently accurate results, except that the 
temperature-correction factor used for specially denatured spirits, 
Formula No. 18, should be that given in table 7 for 100 proof spirits. 
When the quantity of spirits, in wine gallons, has been determined by 
volumetric measurement, the number of proof gallons shall be obtained by 
multiplying the wine gallons by the proof of the spirits as determined 
under Sec. 30.31.

    Example. Gauge glass reading inches--88.
Wine gallons per inch--48.96.
Temperature [deg]F--72.
Proof of spirits--86.8.
Temperature correction factor (Table 7)--0.995.
48.96 W.G.x88=4308.48 wine gallons.
4308.48 W.G.x0.995=4286.94 wine gallons.
4286.94 W.G.x0.868=3721.06392=3721.1 proof gallons.

<R05>
Sec. 30.52  Procedure for measurement of cased spirits.

    Where the quantity of spirits in a case is to be determined by 
volume, such determination shall be made by ascertaining the contents of 
one bottle in the case and multiplying that figure by the number of 
bottles in the case. For cases containing bottles filled according to 
the metric system of measure, the quantity determined shall be converted 
to wine gallons, as provided in Sec. 19.582 of this chapter. The wine 
gallons of spirits thus determined for one case may then be multiplied 
by the number of cases containing spirits at the same proof when 
determining the quantity of spirits for more than one case. The proof 
gallons of spirits in cases shall be determined by multiplying the wine 
gallons by the proof (divided by 100).

                       Subpart E_Prescribed Tables

    Note. The tables referred to in this subpart appear in their 
entirety in the ``Gauging Manual Embracing Instructions and Tables for 
Determining Quantity of Distilled Spirits by Proof and Weight'' which is 
incorporated by reference in this part (see Sec. 30.1).


<R05>
Sec. 30.61  Table 1, showing the true percent of proof spirit for any
indication of the hydrometer at temperatures between zero and 100 

degrees Fahrenheit.

    This table shows the true percent of proof of distilled spirits for 
indications of the hydrometer likely to occur in practice at 
temperatures between zero and 100 degrees Fahrenheit and shall be used 
in determining the proof of spirits. The left-hand column contains the 
reading of the hydrometer and on the same horizontal line, in the body 
of the table, in the ``Temperature'' column corresponding to the reading 
of the thermometer is the corrected reading or ``true percent of 
proof.'' The table is computed for tenths of a percent.
    Example. 

Temperature, [deg]F............................................       75
Hydrometer reading.............................................      193
True percent of proof..........................................    189.5
 


Where fractional readings are ascertained, the proper interpolations 
will be made (see Sec. 30.23). If the distilled spirits contain 
dissolved solids, temperature-correction of the hydrometer reading by 
the use of this table would result in apparent proof rather than true 
proof.

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5204))


<R05>
Sec. 30.62  Table 2, showing wine gallons and proof gallons by weight.

    The wine and proof gallon content by weight and proof of packages of 
distilled spirits usually found in actual practice will be ascertained 
from this table. The left-hand column contains the weights. The true 
percent of proof is shown on the heading of each page in a range from 90 
degrees to 200 degrees. Under the true percent of proof and on the same 
horizontal line with the weight will be found the wine gallons (at 60 
degrees Fahrenheit) and the proof gallons respectively. Where either the 
weight or the proof of a quantity of spirits is beyond the limitations 
of this table, the number of proof gallons may be ascertained by 
reference to Table 3. This table may also be used to ascertain the wine 
gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) and proof gallons of spirituous 
liquor containing dissolved solids where the weight, apparent proof 
(hydrometer indication corrected to 60 degrees Fahrenheit), and 
obscuration factor have been determined.

    Example. 334 lbs. of distilled spirits.
Apparent proof--96.0[deg].
Obscuration--0.8[deg].
True Proof 96.0[deg]+0.8[deg]=96.8[deg].
334 lbs. at 96.0[deg] apparent proof=42.8 wine gallons.
42.8 wine gallonsx96.8[deg]=41.4 proof gallons.
    In addition this table may be used to obtain the wine gallons, at 
the prevailing temperature, of most liquids within the range of the 
table, from the weight of the liquid and the uncorrected reading of the 
hydrometer stem. An application of this would be in determining the 
capacity of a package.
    Example. It is desired to determine, or to check the rated capacity 
of a package having a net weight of 395 pounds when completely filled 
with spirits having an uncorrected hydrometer reading of 113.0[deg]. The 
full capacity of the package, 51.5 wine gallons, would be found by 
referring to the table at 395 pounds and 113[deg] proof (hydrometer 
reading).

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended, 1362, as amended 
(26 U.S.C. 5204, 5211))


<R05>
Sec. 30.63  Table 3, for determining the number of proof gallons from 
the weight and proof of spirituous liquor.

    When the weight or proof of a quantity of distilled spirits is not 
found in Table 2, the proof gallons may be ascertained from Table 3. The 
wine gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) may be ascertained by dividing 
the proof gallons by the proof.

    Example. A tank car of spirits of 190 degrees of proof weighed 
60,378 pounds net. We find--

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 Proof
                                                                gallons
------------------------------------------------------------------------
60,000 pounds equal to.......................................   16,778.4
300 pounds equal to..........................................       83.9
70 pounds equal to...........................................       19.6
8 pounds equal to............................................        2.2
                                                              ----------
      Total..................................................   16,884.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------


That is, the total weight of 60,378 pounds of spirits at 190 proof is 
equal to 16,884.1 proof gallons. The equivalent gallonage for 70 pounds 
is found from the column 700 pounds by moving the decimal point one 
place to the

[[Page 868]]

left; that for 8 pounds from the column 800 pounds by moving the decimal 
point two places to the left.
    Example. A package of spirits at 86 proof weighed 321\1/2\ pounds 
net. We find--

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 Proof
                                                                gallons
------------------------------------------------------------------------
300 pounds equal to..........................................       32.7
20 pounds equal to...........................................        2.2
1 pound equal to.............................................         .1
\1/2\ pound equal to.........................................         .1
                                                              ----------
      Total..................................................       35.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------


That is, 321\1/2\ pounds of spirits at 86 proof is equal to 35.1 proof 
gallons. The equivalent gallonage for 20 pounds is found from the column 
200 pounds by moving the decimal point one place to the left; that for 1 
pound from the column 100 pounds by moving the decimal point two places 
to the left; that for the \1/2\ pound from the column 500 pounds by 
moving the decimal point three places to the left.


Fractional gallons beyond the first decimal ascertained through use of 
this table will be dropped if less than 0.05 or will be added as 0.1 if 
0.05 or more. The wine gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) may be 
determined by dividing the proof gallons by the proof. For example: 35.1 
divided by 0.86 equals 40.8 wine gallons.

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended (26 U.S.C.5204))


<R05>
Sec. 30.64  Table 4, showing the fractional part of a gallon per pound 
at each percent and each tenth percent of proof of spirituous liquor.

    This table provides a method for use in ascertaining the wine gallon 
(at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) and/or proof gallon contents of containers of 
spirits by multiplying the net weight of the spirits by the fractional 
part of a gallon per pound shown in the table for spirits of the same 
proof. Fractional gallons beyond the first decimal will be dropped if 
less than 0.05 or will be added as 0.1 if 0.05 or more.

    Example. It is desired to ascertain the wine gallons and proof 
gallons of a tank of 190 proof spirits weighing 81,000 pounds.

81,000x0.14718=11,921.58=11,921.6 wine gallons.
81,000x0.27964=22,650.84=22,650.8 proof gallons.


This table may also be used for ascertaining the quantity of water 
required to reduce to a given proof. To do this, divide the proof 
gallons of spirits to be reduced by the fractional part of a proof 
gallon per pound of spirits at the proof to which the spirits are to be 
reduced, and subtract from the quotient the net weight of the spirits 
before reduction. The remainder will be the pounds of water needed to 
reduce the spirits to the desired proof.

    Example. It is desired to ascertain the quantity of water needed to 
reduce 1,000 pounds of 200 proof spirits, 302.58 proof gallons, to 190 
proof:

302.58 divided by 0.27964 equals 1,082.03 pounds, weight of spirits 
after reduction.
1.082.03 minus 1,000 equals 82.03 pounds, weight of water required to 
reduce to desired proof.


The slight variation between this table and Tables 2, 3, and 5 on some 
calculations is due to the dropping or adding of fractions beyond the 
first decimal in those tables. This table may also be used to determine 
the wine gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) of distilled spirits 
containing dissolved solids from the total weight of the liquid and its 
apparent proof (hydrometer indication, corrected to 60 degrees 
Fahrenheit). The proof gallons may then be found by multiplying the wine 
gallons by the true proof.

    Example. 5,350 pounds of blended whisky containing added solids

Temperature [deg]F.............................................75.0[deg]
Hydrometer reading.............................................92.0[deg]
Apparent proof.................................................85.5[deg]
Obscuration.....................................................0.5[deg]
True proof.....................................................86.0[deg]

5,350.0 lbs.x0.12676 (W.G. per pound factor for apparent proof of 
85.5[deg])=678.2 wine gallons
678.2 W.G.x0.86=583.3 proof gallons

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended 1362, as amended 
(26 U.S.C. 5204, 5211))


<R05>
Sec. 30.65  Table 5, showing the weight per wine gallon (at 60 degrees
Fahrenheit) and proof gallon at each percent of proof of spirituous 

liquor.

    This table may be used to ascertain the weight of any given number 
of wine gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) or proof gallons of spirits 
by multiplying the pounds per gallon by the given number of gallons of 
the spirits. The table should be especially useful where

[[Page 869]]

it is desired to weigh a precise quantity of spirits.

    Example. It is desired to ascertain the weight of 100 wine gallons 
of 190 proof spirits:

6.79434x100 equals 679.43 pounds, net weight of 100 wine gallons of 190 
proofs spirits.
    Example. It is desired to ascertain the weight of 100 proof gallons 
of 190 proof spirits.

3.57597x100 equals 357.60 pounds, net weight of 100 proof gallons of 190 
proof spirits.


The slight variation between this table and Tables 2 and 3 on some 
calculations is due to dropping or adding of fractions beyond the first 
decimal on those tables. This table also shows the weight per wine 
gallon (at the prevailing temperature) corresponding to each uncorrected 
reading of a proof hydrometer.

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5204))


<R05>
Sec. 30.66  Table 6, showing respective volumes of alcohol and water
and the specific gravity in both air and vacuum of spirituous liquor.

    This table provides an alternate method for use in ascertaining the 
quantity of water needed to reduce the strength of distilled spirits by 
a definite amount. To do this, divide the alcohol in the given strength 
by the alcohol in the required strength, multiply the quotient by the 
water in the required strength, and subtract the water in the given 
strength from the product. The remainder is the number of gallons of 
water to be added to 100 gallons of spirits of the given strength to 
produce a spirit of a required strength.

    Example. It is desired to reduce spirits of 191 proof to 188 proof. 
We find that 191 proof spirits contains 95.5 parts alcohol and 5.59 
parts water, and 188 proof spirits contains 94.0 parts alcohol and 7.36 
parts water.

95.5 (the strength of 100 wine gallons of spirits at 191 proof) divided 
by 94.0 (the strength of 100 wine gallons of spirits at 188 proof) 
equals 1.01.
7.36 (the water in 188 proof) multiplied by 1.01 equals 7.43.
7.43 less 5.59 (the water in 191 proof spirits) equal 1.84 gallons of 
water to be added to each 100 wine gallons of 191 proof spirits to be 
reduced.


This rule is applicable for reducing to any proof; but when it is 
desired to reduce to 100 proof, it is sufficient to point off two 
decimals in the given proof, multiply by 53.73, and deduct the water in 
the given strength. Thus, to reduce 112 proof spirits to 100 proof:

1.12x53.73-47.75 equals 12.42 gallons of water to be added to each 100 
wine gallons of spirits to be reduced.


This table may also be used to obtain the proof gallonage of spirituous 
liquor according to weight and percent of proof.

    Example. It is desired to determine the number of gallons in 400 
pounds of spirits of 141 percent of proof. Multiply the weight of one 
gallon of water in air by the specific gravity in air of the spirits--
8.32823 by 0.88862--the product (7.40063) divided into 400 gives 54.049 
wine gallons, which rounded to the nearest hundredth is 54.05 and 
multiplied by 1.41 gives 76.2 proof gallons. In rounding off where the 
decimal is less than five, it will be dropped; if it is five or over a 
unit will be added.

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5204))


<R05>
Sec. 30.67  Table 7, for correction of volume of spirituous liquors 
to 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

    This table is prescribed for use in correcting spirits to volume at 
60 degrees Fahrenheit. To do this, multiply the wine gallons of spirits 
which it is desired to correct to volume at 60 degrees Fahrenheit by the 
factor shown in the table at the percent of proof and temperature of the 
spirits. The product will be the corrected gallonage at 60 degrees 
Fahrenheit. This table is also prescribed for use in ascertaining the 
true capacity of containers where the wine gallon contents at 60 degrees 
Fahrenheit have been determined by weight in accordance with Tables 2, 
3, 4, or 5. This is accomplished by dividing the wine gallons at 60 
degrees Fahrenheit by the factor shown in the table at the percent of 
proof and temperature of the spirits. The quotient will be the true 
capacity of the container.

    Example. It is desired to ascertain the volume at 60 degrees 
Fahrenheit of 1,000 wine gallons of 190 proof spirits at 76 degrees 
Fahrenheit:

1,000x0.991 equals 991 wine gallons, the corrected gallonage at 60 
degrees Fahrenheit.
    Example. It is desired to ascertain the capacity of a container of 
190 proof spirits at 76

[[Page 870]]

degrees Fahrenheit, shown by Table 2 to contain 55.1 wine gallons at 60 
degrees Fahrenheit:

55.1 divided by 0.991 equals 55.6 wine gallons, the true capacity of the 
container when filled with spirits of 60 degrees temperature.


It will be noted the table is prepared in multiples of 5 percent of 
proof and 2 degrees temperature. Where the spirits to be corrected are 
of an odd temperature, one-half of the difference, if any, between the 
factors for the next higher and lower temperature, should be added to 
the factor for the next higher temperature.

    Example. It is desired to correct spirits of 180 proof at 51 degrees 
temperature:

1.006 (50[deg])-1.005 (52[deg])=0.001 divided by 2=0.0005
0.0005+1.005=1.0055 correction factor at 51 [deg]F.
    Example. It is desired to correct spirits of 180 proof at 53 degrees 
temperature:

1.005 (52[deg])-1.003 (54[deg])=0.002 divided by 2=0.001
0.001+1.003=1.004 correction factor at 53 [deg]F.


Where the percent of proof is other than a multiple of five, the 
difference, if any, between the factors for the next higher and lower 
proofs should be divided by five and multiplied by the degrees of proof 
beyond the next lower proof, and the fractional product so obtained 
should be added to the factor for the next lower proof (if the 
temperature is above 60 degrees Fahrenheit, the fractional product so 
obtained must be subtracted from the factor for next lower proof), or if 
it is also necessary to correct the factor because of odd temperature, 
to the temperature corrected factor for the next lower proof.

    Example. It is desired to ascertain the correction factor for 
spirits of 112 proof at 47 degrees temperature:

1.006 (46[deg])-1.005 (48[deg])=0.001 divided by 2=0.0005
0.0005+1.005=1.0055 corrected factor at 47 [deg]F.
1.007 (115 proof)-1.006 (110 proof)=0.001
0.001 divided by 5=0.0002 (for each percent of proof)x2 (for 112 
proof)=0.0001
0.0004=1.0055 (corrected factor at 47 [deg]F.)=1.0059 correction factor 
to be used for 112 proof at 47 [deg]F
    Example. It is desired to ascertain the correction factor for 
spirits of 97 proof at 93 degrees temperature:

0.986 (92[deg])-0.985 (94[deg])=0.001 divided by 2=0.0005
0.0005+0.985=0.9855 corrected factor at 93 [deg]F.
0.986 (95 proof)-0.985 (100 proof)=0.001
0.001 divided by 5=0.0002 (for each percent of proof)x2 (for 97 
proof)=0.0004
0.9855 (corrected factor at 93 [deg]F.)=0.0005=0.9851 correction factor 
to be used for 97 proof at 93 [deg]F.

    (a) Criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for failure to comply 
with the requirements of this part are imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5603 and 
5687. A failure to register as required by this part may result in a 
penalty under 26 U.S.C. 5603(b).
    (b) Administrative penalty. An administrative penalty for failure to 
supply the required identifying number (employer identification number) 
in a dealer's registration is imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6723. The penalty is 
$50 for each such failure, but not more than $100,000 for all such 
failures during a calendar year. A failure to submit a registration 
includes a failure to include the identifying number on the 
registration.
    (c) Reasonable cause. The administrative penalty described in 
paragraph (b) of this section is not imposed when it is shown that the 
failure was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. A 
dealer who believes that the circumstances that led to the failure were 
reasonable and who desires to have the penalty waived shall submit a 
written statement, under the penalty of perjury, affirmatively showing 
all of the circumstances alleged as reasonable causes for the failure. 
If the appropriate TTB officer determines that the failure was due to a 
reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, the penalty will not be 
assessed. If the dealer exercised ordinary business care and prudence 
but was nevertheless unable to comply with the requirement, then the 
failure was due to reasonable cause. Mere ignorance of the law will not 
be considered a reasonable cause.

civic, church, labor, charitable, benevolent, or ex-servicemen's 
organization selling distilled spirits, beer, or wine, or any 
combination thereof, on the occasion of any kind of entertainment, 
dance, picnic, bazaar, or festival held by it, is a ``limited retail

business as a dealer.

<R05>
Sec. 31.36  Sales of 20 wine gallons (75.7 liters) or more.

    Any person who sells or offers for sale distilled spirits, wines, or

same person at the same time, shall be presumed and held to be a 
wholesale dealer in liquors or a wholesale dealer in beer, as the case

    (2) Conducts a bar for the sale of liquors on the occasion of an 
outing, picnic, or other entertainment, unless the club is a ``limited 
retail dealer'' described in Sec. 31.35. The registration of the

at the place where those warehouse receipts are sold, or offered for 
sale, unless the person is exempt from those requirements under subpart 
D of this part.

(26 U.S.C. 5121, 5122)

    A single sale of distilled spirits, wines, or beer, or a single sale

and other requirements of this part.

(26 U.S.C. 5121, 5122)


<R05>
Sec. 31.62  Persons making casual sales.

    Certain persons making casual sales of liquors are not dealers for 
purposes of this part and therefore are not required to register, keep 
records, or submit a report as required of dealers under this part. 
These persons are:
    (a) Administrators, executors, receivers, and other fiduciaries who

others.

    Certain persons may sell liquors as agents or employees of others 
(principals), or may receive and transmit orders therefor to a dealer, 
without being considered a dealer on account of those activities. Those 
persons, who have no property rights in the liquors sold, may make 
collections for their principals and receive commissions for their 
services, or may guarantee the payment of accounts, without being 
required to register or keep records under this part. In all such cases, 
however, the principal is required to register and keep records, as 
provided in this part, at each place where sales are consummated, unless 
the principal is exempt from those requirements under the provisions of 
this subpart. The persons covered by this section are:
    (a) Auctioneers who merely sell liquors at auction on behalf of

    (b) Restrictions. Any person who sells or offers for sale any 
nonbeverage products for use, or for sale for use, for beverage 
purposes, or who sells any of such products under circumstances in which 
it might reasonably appear that it is the intention of the purchaser to 
procure the product for sale or use for beverage purposes, must register 
and keep records as required under this part as a wholesale dealer in

<R05>
Sec. 31.67  Persons returning liquors for credit, refund, or exchange.

    No retail dealer in liquors or retail dealer in beer, or other 
person, shall be deemed to be a wholesale dealer in liquors or a 
wholesale dealer in beer by virtue of a bona fide return of distilled 
spirits, wines, or beer to the dealer from whom the distilled spirits, 
wines, or beer were purchased (or to the successor of such vendor's 
business or line of merchandise) for credit, refund, or exchange; and 
the giving of such credit, refund or exchange shall not be deemed

[[Page 880]]

to be a purchase within the meaning of Sec. 31.141 of this part. Except 
in the case of wholesale dealers in liquors required to keep records of 
their transactions under Sec. Sec. 31.155 and 31.156, or retail dealers

<R05>
Sec. 31.71  Registration required at each place of business.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 31.43 and in subpart D of this 
part, registration is required under this part for each and every place 
where distilled spirits, wines, or beer are sold or offered for sale. No 
person may engage in any business for which registration is required 
until the place of business has been registered in accordance with this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 31.72  Place of sale.

    For purposes of this part, the place at which ownership of liquors 
is transferred, actually or constructively, is the place of sale.


<R05>
Sec. 31.73  Place of offering for sale.

    Liquors are considered to be offered for sale at the place where 
they are kept for sale and where a sale could take place, and at any 
place where sales are in fact consummated. Liquors are not considered to 
be offered for sale by sending an agent out to take orders, or by 
establishing an office for the mere purpose of taking orders, so long as 
in each case the orders received are transmitted to the principal for 
acceptance at the place where that principal has registered under this 
part or where the principal is exempt from registration as provided in 
subpart D of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 31.74  Places of storage; deliveries therefrom.

    Registration is not required under this part for warehouses and 
similar places that are used by dealers merely for the storage of 
liquors and that are not places where orders for liquors are accepted. 
When orders for liquors are received and duly accepted at a place that 
the dealer has registered under this part, the subsequent actual 
delivery of the liquors from a place of storage does not require 
registration at that place of storage. Except as otherwise provided in 
Sec. Sec. 31.52 and 31.53, a dealer who registered a given place, and 
who makes actual delivery of liquors from a warehouse at another place, 
must register for the place where ownership of the liquors is 
transferred if there was no prior constructive delivery by the 
acceptance of an order for the liquors at the place covered by the 
existing registration.


<R05>
Sec. 31.75  Dealer in beer and dealer in liquors at the same location.

    Any person who registers as a wholesale dealer in beer or retail 
dealer in beer and who thereafter begins to sell distilled spirits or 
wine must also register as a wholesale dealer in liquors or retail 
dealer in liquors before commencing the sale, or offering for sale, of 
distilled spirits or wine.

<R05>
Sec. 31.81  General.

    When liquors are sold by a proprietor in two or more areas within 
the proprietor's place of business, only one registration is required 
under this part. When the proprietor leases to another person or persons 
the privilege of selling liquors in two or more areas within the 
proprietor's place of business, whether the privilege is exercised 
separately or simultaneously with the proprietor or another 
concessionaire, each lessee is required to register only once.


<R05>
Sec. 31.82  Hotels.

    The proprietor of a hotel who conducts the sale of liquors 
throughout the hotel premises is only required to register under this 
part for one place. For example, different areas operated by the 
proprietor in the hotel, such as banquet rooms, meeting rooms, and guest 
rooms, collectively constitute a single place of business. When a 
concessionaire conducts the sale of liquors

[[Page 881]]

at two or more areas in a hotel, those areas are regarded as a single 
place of business, and the concessionaire is required to register only 
once.


<R05>
Sec. 31.83  Ball park, race track, etc.; sales throughout the premises.

concessionaire having the same privilege throughout the enclosure, 
whether the privilege is exercised separately or simultaneously with the 
proprietor or another concessionaire, is required to register only once 
for the entire enclosure.

passenger carriers for which registration is being completed.


<R05>
Sec. 31.92  Carriers not engaged in passenger service.

port or harbor. Such persons must specify, on an attachment to the 
registration form, the following: that the business will consist of 
supplying exclusively boats, vessels, or persons thereon; the name of

more fixed addresses, the dealer must prepare one registration form 
covering all of those addresses and must include on the attachment to 
the registration form the number of supply boats or vessels operating 
from each address.


<R05>

    A retail dealer in liquors or a retail dealer in beer whose business 
requires the dealer to travel from place to place, such as a dealer who 
sells at carnivals or circuses, must register ``At Large'' covering the 
dealer's activities throughout the United States by filing only one 
registration. A dealer submitting such a registration must state on the 
registration form, or on an attachment thereto, the nature of the 
dealer's business and the reason the dealer requires registration ``At 
Large.''


<R05>
Sec. 31.95  Caterers.

    (a) General. When a contract to furnish liquors is made by a caterer 
at a place of business for which the caterer has registered under this 
part, no additional registration is required by virtue of the serving of 
the liquors at a different location.
    (b) Additional registration. When the contract of a caterer provides 
for the sale of liquors by the drink at a place, or simultaneously at 
different places, other than the place of business for which the caterer 
has registered under this part, a separate registration is required for 
each such place if the caterer does not keep the records specified in 
paragraph (c) of this section.

form is received in the mail and the U.S. postmark on the cover shows 
that it was deposited in the mail in the United States within the time 
prescribed for filing in an envelope or other appropriate wrapper that 
was properly addressed with postage prepaid, the form will be considered 
as timely filed. If the postmark is not legible, the sender has the 
burden of proving the date when the postmark was made. When registered 
mail is used, the date of postal registration will be accepted as the 
postmark date.
    (b) Transition rule. Dealers already engaged in business prior to 
July 1, 2008, must register as an ``existing business'' unless they had

    (2) Prepare, on the form, or on an attachment identified with the 
taxpayer's name, mailing address (as shown on TTB Form 5630.5d), and 
employer identification number, a list showing, by States, the trade 
name, address, telephone number, and dealer class of each location for 
which registration is being made. The original of the list must be filed

Sec. 31.115  Employer identification number.

    (a) Requirement. The employer identification number (as defined in 
26 CFR 301.7701-12) of a dealer who has been assigned such a number must 
be shown on each registration form filed under this part. A dealer who 
does not have such a number must apply for one as provided in paragraph 
(b) of this section and enter ``number applied for'' in the space for 
the number on the registration form; then, upon receipt of the number 
from the Internal Revenue Service, the dealer must provide it to TTB by 
separate correspondence. Failure of a dealer to include the employer 
identification number may result in the imposition of the penalty 
specified in Sec. 31.14(b).
    (b) Application for employer identification number. Each dealer who 
files a registration form and who has not already been assigned an 
employer identification number must file Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
Form SS-4 to apply for one. The dealer shall apply for and be assigned 
only one employer identification number, regardless of the number of 
places of business for which the dealer is required to file a 
registration form under this part. The employer identification number 
shall be applied for no later than 7 days after the filing of the 
taxpayer's first registration form. IRS Form SS-4 may be obtained from 
the director of an IRS

<R05>
Sec. 31.116  Execution of registration form.

    The registration of an individual proprietor shall be signed by the 
proprietor, the registration of a partnership shall be signed by a 
member of the firm, and the registration of a corporation shall be 
signed by a duly authorized officer thereof; however, any individual, 
partnership, or corporation that is a proprietor may appoint an agent to 
sign on the proprietor's behalf. The person signing the registration 
form must identify his or her signing capacity as ``individual owner,'' 
``member of firm,'' ``agent,'' or ``attorney-in-fact,'' as appropriate, 
or, in the case of a corporation, by the title of the signing officer. A 
receiver, trustee, assignee, executor, administrator, or other legal 
representative who continues the business of a dealer by reason of 
death, insolvency, or other circumstance must indicate the fiduciary 
capacity in which he or she acts. Registration forms signed by persons 
as agents or attorneys-in-fact will not be accepted unless, in each 
instance, the principal named on the form has executed a power of 
attorney authorizing that person to sign and that power of attorney is 
filed with the TTB officer with whom the TTB Form 5630.5d is required to 
be filed. Form 5630.5d must be verified by a written declaration that it 
has been executed under the penalties of perjury.

wine gallons. Once converted to wine gallons, the proof gallons of 
spirits in cases must be determined as provided in Sec. 30.52 of this

liquors maintains a separate department on the premises for the 
retailing of distilled spirits, and the retail sales of distilled 
spirits normally represent 90 percent or more of the volume of distilled 
spirits sold, the dealer may ``constructively'' receive all distilled 
spirits in the retail department. Sales involving a wholesale 
transaction may be ``constructively'' sold through the wholesale 
department.
    (1) Receipts. In lieu of maintaining and preparing the records 
required by Sec. 31.155, a wholesale dealer may constructively receive 
all distilled spirits in its retail department. In this case, the 
receiving document will serve as a receipt for (through) the wholesale 
department and a disposition (transfer) to the retail department. The 
receiving document must be maintained by the retail department in 
accordance with Sec. 31.171.
    (2) Dispositions. In lieu of maintaining and preparing the records 
required by Sec. 31.156, a wholesale dealer may constructively sell 
distilled spirits from its retail department to other dealers. The sales 
invoice or bill must be filed in the wholesaler's disposition records 
and will serve as a record of receipt from the retail department and a 
record of disposition to another dealer.
    (b) Receipt and disposition records. Except as provided in paragraph 
(a) of this section, a wholesale dealer must prepare and maintain the 
required records of receipt and disposition as prescribed in Sec. Sec. 
31.155 and 31.156. Transfers between the wholesale and retail 
departments will be treated in the same manner as any other transaction 
involving the wholesale department.
    (c) Monthly summary report. When required by Sec. 31.160, a 
wholesale dealer must prepare and file the monthly summary report of 
actual or constructive receipts and dispositions of all distilled 
spirits.
    (d) Physical separation. Wholesale and retail departments need not 
be physically separated.

    A wholesale dealer may file the records of receipt and disposition 
required by Sec. Sec. 31.155 and 31.156 in accordance with the 
wholesaler's regular accounting and recordkeeping systems. The required 
records must include the dealer's own file copies of the receiving or 
shipping invoices and must be filed according to the following rules:
    (a) Wholesale dealers may file records of receipt and disposition in 
accordance with their own filing system as long as the records are filed 
by transaction or reporting date and the filing system systematically 
and accurately accounts for all receipts and dispositions of distilled 
spirits.
    (b) The required records of receipt and disposition must be filed 
not later than one business day following the date the transaction 
occurred.
    (c) Supporting documents for receipts and dispositions, such as 
delivery receipts and bills of lading, also may be filed in accordance

the dealer's place of business. The appropriate TTB officer may, upon 
request, authorize maintenance of files, or an individual file, at 
another business location under the control of the same wholesale 
dealer, when it is determined that such maintenance will not cause undue 
inconvenience to TTB officers desiring to examine those files.

    (a) Records of receipt. All retail dealers must keep at their place 
of business complete records showing the quantities of all distilled 
spirits, wines, and beer received, from whom the distilled spirits, 
wines, and beer were received, and the dates of receipt. However, the 
appropriate TTB officer may, upon request, authorize the maintenance of

retail dealer when it is determined that such maintenance will not cause 
undue inconvenience to TTB officers desiring to examine those records. 
Records of receipts shall consist of all purchase invoices or bills 
covering distilled spirits, wines, and beer received, or, at the option 
of the retail dealer, a book record containing all of the required 
information.
    (b) Records of sales of 20 wine gallons (75.7 liters) or more. Every 
retail dealer who makes sales of distilled spirits, of wines, or of beer 
in quantities of 20 wine gallons (75.7 liters) or more to the same 
person at the same time must prepare and keep a record of each sale. The 
record must show the date of sale, the name and address of the 
purchaser, the kind and quantity of each kind of liquors sold, and the 
serial numbers of all full cases of distilled spirits included in the 
sale. Each entry on that record must be supported by a corresponding 
delivery receipt (which may be executed on a copy of the sales slip) 
signed by the purchaser or the purchaser's agent.
