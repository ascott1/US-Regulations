              the Federal Register (44 U.S.C. 1510).

          It is prohibited to use NARA's official seal and the stylized Code 
              of Federal Regulations logo on any republication of this 
              material without the express, written permission of the 
              Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee. 
              Any person using NARA's official seals and logos in a manner 
              inconsistent with the provisions of 36 CFR part 1200 is

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, April 1, 2010), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, Washington DC 20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

<R04>
                Subpart C_Standards of Identity for Wine


<R05>
Sec. 4.20  Application of standards.

    The standards of identity for the several classes and types of wine 
set forth herein shall be applicable to all regulations and permits 
issued under the act. Whenever any term for which a standard of identity 
has been established herein is used in any such regulation or permit, 
such term shall have the meaning assigned to it by such standard of 
identity.


<R05>
Sec. 4.21  The standards of identity.

    Standards of identity for the several classes and types of wine set 
forth in this part shall be as follows:
    (a) Class 1; grape wine--(1) Grape wine is wine produced by the 
normal alcoholic fermentation of the juice of sound, ripe grapes 
(including restored or unrestored pure condensed grape

[[Page 16]]

must), with or without the addition, after fermentation, of pure 
condensed grape must, and with or without added grape brandy or alcohol, 
but without other addition or abstraction except as may occur in cellar 
treatment: Provided, That the product may be ameliorated before, during 
or after fermentation by either of the following methods:
    (i) By adding, separately or in combination, dry sugar, or such an 
amount of sugar and water solution as will not increase the volume of 
the resulting product more than 35 percent; but in no event shall any 
product so ameliorated have an alcoholic content derived by 
fermentation, of more than 13 percent by volume, or a natural acid 
content, if water has been added, of less than 5 parts per thousand, or 
a total solids content of more than 22 grams per 100 cubic centimeters.
    (ii) By adding, separately or in combination, not more than 20 
percent by weight of dry sugar, or not more than 10 percent by weight of 
water.
    (iii) In the case of domestic wine, in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 
5383.
    (iv) The maximum volatile acidity, calculated as acetic acid and 
exclusive of sulfur dioxide is 0.14 gram per 100 mL (20 [deg]C) for 
natural red wine and 0.12 gram per 100 mL (20 [deg]C) for other grape 
wine: Provided, That the maximum volatile acidity for wine produced from 
unameliorated juice of 28 or more degrees Brix is 0.17 gram per 100 
milliliters for red wine and 0.15 gram per 100 milliliters for white 
wine. Grape wine deriving its characteristic color or lack of color from 
the presence or absence of the red coloring matter of the skins, juice, 
or pulp of grapes may be designated as ``red wine,'' ``pink (or rose) 
wine,'' ``amber wine,'' or ``white wine'' as the case may be. Any grape 
wine containing no added grape brandy or alcohol may be further 
designated as ``natural.''
    (2) Table wine is grape wine having an alcoholic content not in 
excess of 14 percent by volume. Such wine may also be designated as 
``light wine,'' ``red table wine,'' ``light white wine,'' ``sweet table 
wine,'' etc., as the case may be.
    (3) Dessert wine is grape wine having an alcoholic content in excess 
of 14 percent but not in excess of 24 percent by volume. Dessert wine 
having the taste, aroma and characteristics generally attributed to 
sherry and an alcoholic content, derived in part from added grape brandy 
or alcohol, of not less than 17 percent by volume, may be designated as 
``sherry''. Dessert wines having the taste, aroma and characteristics 
generally attributed to angelica, madeira, muscatel and port and an 
alcoholic content, derived in part from added grape brandy or alcohol, 
of not less than 18 percent by volume, may be designated as 
``angelica,'' ``madeira,'' ``muscatel,'' or ``port'' respectively. 
Dessert wines having the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally 
attributed to any of the above products and an alcoholic content, 
derived in part from added grape brandy or alcohol, in excess of 14 
percent by volume but, in the case of sherry, less than 17 percent, or, 
in other cases, less than 18 percent by volume, may be designated as 
``light sherry,'' ``light angelica,'' ``light madeira,'' ``light 
muscatel'' or ``light port,'' respectively.
    (b) Class 2; sparkling grape wine. (1) Sparkling grape wine 
(including ``sparkling wine,'' ``sparkling red wine'' and ``sparkling 
white wine'') is grape wine made effervescent with carbon dioxide 
resulting solely from the fermentation of the wine within a closed 
container, tank or bottle.
    (2) Champagne is a type of sparkling light wine which derives its 
effervescence solely from the secondary fermentation of the wine within 
glass containers of not greater than one gallon capacity, and which 
possesses the taste, aroma, and other characteristics attributed to 
champagne as made in the champagne district of France.
    (3)(i) A sparkling light wine having the taste, aroma, and 
characteristics generally attributed to champagne but not otherwise 
conforming to the standard for ``champagne'' may, in addition to but not 
in lieu of the class designation ``sparkling wine,'' be further 
designated as:
    (A) ``Champagne style;'' or
    (B) ``Champagne type;'' or
    (C) ``American (or New York State, Napa Valley, etc.) champagne,'' 
along with one of the following terms: ``Bulk

[[Page 17]]

process,'' ``fermented outside the bottle,'' ``secondary fermentation 
outside the bottle,'' ``secondary fermentation before bottling,'' ``not 
fermented in the bottle,'' or ``not bottle fermented.'' The term 
``charmat method'' or ``charmat process'' may be used as additional 
information.
    (ii) Labels shall be so designed that all the words in such further 
designation are readily legible under ordinary conditions and are on a 
contrasting background. In the case of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(C) of this 
section, TTB will consider whether the label as a whole provides the 
consumer with adequate information about the method of production and 
origin of the wine. TTB will evaluate each label for legibility and 
clarity, based on such factors as type size and style for all components 
of the further designation and the optional term ``charmat method'' or 
``charmat process,'' as well as the contrast between the lettering and 
its background, and the placement of information on the label.
    (iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A), (B) 
and (C) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer may authorize the 
use of a term on sparkling wine labels, as an alternative to those terms 
authorized in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, but not in lieu of 
the required class designation ``sparkling wine,'' upon a finding that 
such term adequately informs the consumer about the method of production 
of the sparkling wine.
    (4) Crackling wine, petillant wine, frizzante wine (including 
cremant, perlant, reciotto, and other similar wine) is sparkling light 
wine normally less effervescent than champagne or other similar 
sparkling wine, but containing sufficient carbon dioxide in solution to 
produce, upon pouring under normal conditions, after the disappearance 
of air bubbles, a slow and steady effervescence evidenced by the 
formation of gas bubbles flowing through the wine. Crackling wine which 
derives its effervescence from secondary fermentation in containers 
greater than 1-gallon capacity shall be designated ``crackling wine--
bulk process,'' and the words ``bulk process'' shall appear in lettering 
of substantially the same size as the words ``crackling wine.''
    (c) Class 3; carbonated grape wine. ``Carbonated grape wine'' 
(including ``carbonated wine,'' ``carbonated red wine,'' and 
``carbonated white wine'') is grape wine made effervescent with carbon 
dioxide other than that resulting solely from the secondary fermentation 
of the wine within a closed container, tank or bottle.
    (d) Class 4; citrus wine. (1)(i) Citrus wine or citrus fruit wine is 
wine produced by the normal alcoholic fermentation of the juice of 
sound, ripe citrus fruit (including restored or unrestored pure 
condensed citrus must), with or without the addition, after 
fermentation, of pure condensed citrus must, and with or without added 
citrus brandy or alcohol, but without any other addition or abstraction 
except as may occur in cellar treatment: Provided, That a domestic 
product may be ameliorated or sweetened in accordance with the 
provisions of 26 U.S.C. 5384 and any product other than domestic may be 
ameliorated before, during, or after fermentation by adding, separately 
or in combination, dry sugar, or such an amount of sugar and water 
solution as will not increase the volume of the resulting product more 
than 35 percent, or in the case of products produced from citrus fruit 
having a normal acidity of 20 parts or more per thousand, not more than 
60 percent, but in no event shall any product so ameliorated have an 
alcoholic content, derived by fermentation, of more than 14 percent by 
volume, or a natural acid content, if water has been added, of less than 
5 parts per thousand, or a total solids content or more than 22 grams 
per 100 cubic centimeters.
    (ii) The maximum volatile acidity, calculated as acetic acid and 
exclusive of sulfur dioxide, shall not be, for natural citrus wine, more 
than 0.14 gram, and for other citrus wine, more than 0.12 gram, per 100 
milliliters (20 [deg]C.).
    (iii) Any citrus wine containing no added brandy or alcohol may be 
further designated as ``natural.''
    (2) Citrus table wine or citrus fruit table wine is citrus wine 
having an alcoholic content not in excess of 14 percent by volume. Such 
wine may also be designated ``light citrus wine,'' ``light citrus fruit 
wine,'' ``light sweet citrus fruit wine,'' etc., as the case may be.

[[Page 18]]

    (3) Citrus dessert wine or citrus fruit dessert wine is citrus wine 
having an alcoholic content in excess of 14 percent but not in excess of 
24 percent by volume.
    (4) Citrus wine derived wholly (except for sugar, water, or added 
alcohol) from one kind of citrus fruit, shall be designated by the word 
``wine'' qualified by the name of such citrus fruit, e.g., ``orange 
wine,'' ``grapefruit wine.'' Citrus wine not derived wholly from one 
kind of citrus fruit shall be designated as ``citrus wine'' or ``citrus 
fruit wine'' qualified by a truthful and adequate statement of 
composition appearing in direct conjunction therewith. Citrus wine 
rendered effervescent by carbon dioxide resulting solely from the 
secondary fermentation of the wine within a closed container, tank, or 
bottle shall be further designated as ``sparkling''; and citrus wine 
rendered effervescent by carbon dioxide otherwise derived shall be 
further designated as ``carbonated.''
    (e) Class 5; fruit wine. (1)(i) Fruit wine is wine (other than grape 
wine or citrus wine) produced by the normal alcoholic fermentation of 
the juice of sound, ripe fruit (including restored or unrestored pure 
condensed fruit must), with or without the addition, after fermentation, 
of pure condensed fruit must, and with or without added fruit brandy or 
alcohol, but without other addition or abstraction except as may occur 
in cellar treatment: Provided, That a domestic product may be 
ameliorated or sweetened in accordance with the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 
5384 and any product other than domestic may be ameliorated before, 
during, or after fermentation by adding, separately or in combination, 
dry sugar, or such an amount of dry sugar and water solution as will 
increase the volume of the resulting product, in the case of wines 
produced from any fruit or berry other than grapes, having a normal 
acidity of 20 parts or more per thousand, not more than 60 percent, and 
in the case of other fruit wines, not more than 35%, but in no event 
shall any product so ameliorated have an alcoholic content, derived by 
fermentation, of more than 14 percent by volume, or a natural acid 
content, if water has been added, of less than 5 parts per thousand, or 
a total solids content of more than 22 grams per 100 cubic centimeters.
    (ii) The maximum volatile acidity, calculated as acetic acid and 
exclusive of sulfur dioxide, shall not be, for natural fruit wine, more 
than 0.14 gram, and for other fruit wine, more than 0.12 gram, per 100 
milliliters (20 [deg]C.).
    (iii) Any fruit wine containing no added brandy or alcohol may be 
further designated as ``natural.''
    (2) Berry wine is fruit wine produced from berries.
    (3) Fruit table wine or berry table wine is fruit or berry wine 
having an alcoholic content not in excess of 14 percent by volume. Such 
wine may also be designated ``light fruit wine,'' or ``light berry 
wine.''
    (4) Fruit dessert wine or berry dessert wine is fruit or berry wine 
having an alcoholic content in excess of 14 percent but not in excess of 
24 percent by volume.
    (5) Fruit wine derived wholly (except for sugar, water, or added 
alcohol) from one kind of fruit shall be designated by the word ``wine'' 
qualified by the name of such fruit, e.g., ``peach wine,'' ``blackberry 
wine.'' Fruit wine not derived wholly from one kind of fruit shall be 
designated as ``fruit wine'' or ``berry wine,'' as the case may be, 
qualified by a truthful and adequate statement of composition appearing 
in direct conjunction therewith. Fruit wines which are derived wholly 
(except for sugar, water, or added alcohol) from apples or pears may be 
designated ``cider'' and ``perry,'' respectively, and shall be so 
designated if lacking in vinous taste, aroma, and characteristics. Fruit 
wine rendered effervescent by carbon dioxide resulting solely from the 
secondary fermentation of the wine within a closed container, tank, or 
bottle shall be further designated as ``sparkling''; and fruit wine 
rendered effervescent by carbon dioxide otherwise derived shall be 
further designated as ``carbonated.''
    (f) Class 6; wine from other agricultural products. (1)(i) Wine of 
this class is wine (other than grape wine, citrus wine, or fruit wine) 
made by the normal alcoholic fermentation of sound fermentable 
agricultural products, either fresh or dried, or of the restored or

[[Page 19]]

unrestored pure condensed must thereof, with the addition before or 
during fermentation of a volume of water not greater than the minimum 
necessary to correct natural moisture deficiencies in such products, 
with or without the addition, after fermentation, of pure condensed 
must, and with or without added alcohol or such other spirits as will 
not alter the character of the product, but without other addition or 
abstraction except as may occur in cellar treatment: Provided, That a 
domestic product may be ameliorated or sweetened in accordance with part 
24, of this chapter, and any product other than domestic may be 
ameliorated before, during, or after fermentation by adding, separately 
or in combination, dry sugar or such an amount of sugar and water 
solution as will not increase the volume of the resulting product more 
than 35 percent, but in no event shall any product so ameliorated have 
an alcoholic content, derived by fermentation of more than 14 percent by 
volume, or a natural acid content, if water has been added, of less than 
5 parts per thousand, or a total solids content of more than 22 grams 
per 100 cubic centimeters.
    (ii) The maximum volatile acidity, calculated as acetic acid and 
exclusive of sulfur dioxide, shall not be, for natural wine of this 
class, more than 0.14 gram, and for other wine of this class, more than 
0.12 gram, per 100 milliliters (20 [deg]C.).
    (iii) Wine of this class containing no added alcohol or other 
spirits may be further designated as ``natural''.
    (2) Table wine of this class is wine having an alcoholic content not 
in excess of 14 percent by volume. Such wine may also be designated as 
``light''.

the commonly accepted method of manufacture of such product.
    (6) Wine of this class derived wholly (except for sugar, water, or 
added alcohol) from one kind of agricultural product shall except in the 
case of ``sake,'' be designated by the word ``wine'' qualified by the 
name of such agricultural product, e.g., ``honey wine,'' ``raisin 
wine,'' ``dried blackberry wine.'' Wine of this class not derived wholly 
from one kind of agricultural product shall be designated as ``wine'' 
qualified by a truthful and adequate statement of composition appearing 
in direct conjunction therewith. Wine of this class rendered 
effervescent by carbon dioxide resulting solely from the secondary

of origin other than a country or viticultural area (or its foreign 
equivalent), at least 85 percent of the wine must have been derived from 
grapes harvested in the labeled calendar year.
    (b) American wine. A permittee who produced and bottled or packed 
the wine, or a person other than the producer who repackaged the wine in 
containers of 5 liters or less may show the year of vintage upon the 
label if the person possesses appropriate records from the producer 
substantiating the year of vintage and the appellation of origin; and if 
the wine is made in compliance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (c) Imported wine. Imported wine may bear a vintage date if all of 
the following conditions are met:

[[Page 25]]

    (1) It is made in compliance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of 
this section;
    (2) It is bottled in containers of 5 liters or less prior to

    (3) The invoice is accompanied by, or the American bottler 
possesses, a certificate issued by a duly authorized official of the 
country of origin (if the country of origin authorizes the issuance of 
such certificates) certifying that the wine is of the vintage shown, 
that the laws of the country regulate the appearance of vintage dates 
upon the labels of wine produced for consumption within the country of 
origin, that the wine has been produced in conformity with those laws, 
and that the wine would be entitled to bear the vintage date if it had 
been sold within the country of origin.

or a combination of both.
    (2) For wines bottled on or after January 1, 1999, and prior to 
April 9, 2007, the name ``Gamay Beaujolais'' may be used as a type 
designation only if there appears in direct conjunction therewith, but 
on a separate line and separated by the required appellation of origin, 
the name(s) of the grape variety or varieties used to satisfy the 
requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Where two varietal 
names are listed, they shall appear on the same line, in order of 
predominance. The appellation of origin shall appear either on a 
separate line between the name ``Gamay Beaujolais'' and the grape 
variety name(s) or on the same line as the grape variety name(s) in a 
manner that qualifies the grape variety name(s). The following statement 
shall also appear on the brand or back label: ``Gamay Beaujolais is made 
from at least 75 percent Pinot noir and/or Valdigui[eacute] grapes.''
    (3) The designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' may not be used on labels 
of American wines bottled on or after April 9, 2007.

Sec. 4.32a  Voluntary disclosure of major food allergens.

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section the following terms 
have the meanings indicated.
    (1) Major food allergen. Major food allergen means any of the 
following:
    (i) Milk, egg, fish (for example, bass, flounder, or cod), 
Crustacean shellfish (for example, crab, lobster, or shrimp), tree nuts 
(for example, almonds, pecans, or walnuts), wheat, peanuts, and 
soybeans; or
    (ii) A food ingredient that contains protein derived from a food 
specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, except:
    (A) Any highly refined oil derived from a food specified in 
paragraph

[[Page 27]]

(a)(1)(i) of this section and any ingredient derived from such highly 
refined oil; or
    (B) A food ingredient that is exempt from major food allergen 
labeling requirements pursuant to a petition for exemption approved by 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under 21 U.S.C. 343(w)(6) or 
pursuant to a notice submitted to FDA under 21 U.S.C. 343(w)(7), 
provided that the food ingredient meets the terms or conditions, if any, 
specified for that exemption.
    (2) Name of the food source from which each major food allergen is 
derived. Name of the food source from which each major food allergen is 
derived means the name of the food as listed in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of 
this section, except that:
    (i) In the case of a tree nut, it means the name of the specific 
type of nut (for example, almonds, pecans, or walnuts);
    (ii) In the case of Crustacean shellfish, it means the name of the 
species of Crustacean shellfish (for example, crab, lobster, or shrimp); 
and
    (iii) The names ``egg'' and ``peanuts'', as well as the names of the 
different types of tree nuts, may be expressed in either the singular or 
plural form, and the term ``soy'', soybean'', or ``soya'' may be used 
instead of ``soybeans''.
    (b) Voluntary labeling standards. Major food allergens (defined in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section) used in the production of a wine may, 
on a voluntary basis, be declared on any label affixed to the container. 
However, if any one major food allergen is voluntarily declared, all 
major food allergens used in production of the wine, including major 
food allergens used as fining or processing agents, must be declared, 
except when covered by a petition for exemption approved by the 
appropriate TTB officer under Sec. 4.32b. The major food allergens 
declaration must consist of the word ``Contains'' followed by a colon 
and the name of the food source from which each major food allergen is 
derived (for example, ``Contains: egg'').
    (c) Cross reference. For mandatory labeling requirements applicable 
to wines containing FD&C Yellow No. 5 and sulfites, see Sec. Sec. 
4.32(c) and (e).

<R05>
Sec. 4.32b  Petitions for exemption from major food allergen labeling.

    (a) Submission of petition. Any person may petition the appropriate 
TTB officer to exempt a particular product or class of products from the 
labeling requirements of Sec. 4.32a. The burden is on the petitioner to 
provide scientific evidence (including the analytical method used to 
produce the evidence) that demonstrates that the finished product or 
class of products, as derived by the method specified in the petition, 
either:
    (1) Does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human 
health; or
    (2) Does not contain allergenic protein derived from one of the 
foods identified in Sec. 4.32a(a)(1)(i), even though a major food 
allergen was used in production.
    (b) Decision on petition. TTB will approve or deny a petition for 
exemption submitted under paragraph (a) of this section in writing 
within 180 days of receipt of the petition. If TTB does not provide a 
written response to the petitioner within that 180-day period, the 
petition will be deemed denied, unless an extension of time for decision 
is mutually agreed upon by the appropriate TTB officer and the 
petitioner. TTB may confer with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
on petitions for exemption, as appropriate and as FDA resources permit. 
TTB may require the submission of product samples and other additional 
information in support of a petition; however, unless required by TTB, 
the submission of samples or additional information by the petitioner 
after submission of the petition will be treated as the withdrawal of 
the initial petition and the submission of a new petition. An approval 
or denial under this section will constitute a final agency action.
    (c) Resubmission of a petition. After a petition for exemption is 
denied under this section, the petitioner may resubmit the petition 
along with supporting materials for reconsideration at any time. TTB 
will treat this submission as a new petition for purposes of the time 
frames for decision set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

[[Page 28]]

    (d) Availability of information--(1) General. TTB will promptly post 
to its public Web site, http://www.ttb.gov, all petitions received under 
this section as well as TTB's responses to those petitions. Any 
information submitted in support of the petition that is not posted to 
the TTB Web site will be available to the public pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552, except where a request for confidential treatment is granted under 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (2) Requests for confidential treatment of business information. A 
person who provides trade secrets or other commercial or financial 
information in connection with a petition for exemption under this 
section may request that TTB give confidential treatment to that 
information. A failure to request confidential treatment at the time the 
information in question is submitted to TTB will constitute a waiver of 
confidential treatment. A request for confidential treatment of 
information under this section must conform to the following standards:
    (i) The request must be in writing;
    (ii) The request must clearly identify the information to be kept 
confidential;
    (iii) The request must relate to information that constitutes trade 
secrets or other confidential commercial or financial information 
regarding the business transactions of an interested person, the 
disclosure of which would cause substantial harm to the competitive 
position of that person;
    (iv) The request must set forth the reasons why the information 
should not be disclosed, including the reasons the disclosure of the 
information would prejudice the competitive position of the interested 
person; and
    (v) The request must be supported by a signed statement by the 
interested person, or by an authorized officer or employee of that 
person, certifying that the information in question is a trade secret or 
other confidential commercial or financial information and that the 
information is not already in the public domain.

Sec. 4.33  Brand names.

    (a) General. The product shall bear a brand name, except that if not 
sold under a brand name, then the name of the person required to appear 
on the brand label shall be deemed a brand name for the purpose of this 
part.
    (b) Misleading brand names. No label shall contain any brand name, 
which, standing alone, or in association with other printed or graphic 
matter creates any impression or inference as to the age, origin, 
identity, or other characteristics of the product unless the appropriate 
TTB officer finds that such brand name, either when qualified by the 
word ``brand'' or when not so qualified, conveys no erroneous 
impressions as to the age, origin, identity, or other characteristics of 
the product.
    (c) Trade name of foreign origin. This section shall not operate to 
prohibit the use by any person of any trade name or brand of foreign 
origin not effectively registered in the United States Patent Office on 
August 29, 1935, which has been used by such person or his predecessors 
in the United States for a period of at least five years immediately 
preceding August 29, 1935: Provided, That if such trade name or brand is 
used, the designation of the product shall be qualified by the name of 
the locality in the United States in which produced, and such 
qualifications shall be in script, type, or printing as conspicuous as 
the trade name or brand.


<R05>
Sec. 4.34  Class and type.

    (a) The class of the wine shall be stated in conformity with subpart 
C of this part if the wine is defined therein, except that ``table'' 
(``light'') and ``dessert'' wines need not be designated as such. In the 
case of still grape wine there may appear, in lieu of the class 
designation, any varietal (grape type) designation, type designation of 
varietal significance, semigeneric geographic type designation, or 
geographic distinctive designation, to which the wine may be entitled. 
In the case of champagne, or crackling wines, the type designation 
``champagne'' or ``crackling wine'' (``petillant wine'', ``frizzante 
wine'') may appear in lieu of the class designation ``sparkling wine''. 
In the case of wine which has a total solids content of more than 17 
grams per 100 cubic centimeters the words ``extra sweet'', ``specially 
sweetened'', ``specially sweet'' or ``sweetened with

[[Page 29]]

excess sugar'' shall be stated as a part of the class and type 
designation. The last of these quoted phrases shall appear where 
required by part 24 of this chapter, on wines sweetened with sugar in 
excess of the maximum quantities specified in such regulations. If the 
class of the wine is not defined in subpart C, a truthful and adequate 
statement of composition shall appear upon the brand label of the 
product in lieu of a class designation. In addition to the mandatory 
designation for the wine, there may be stated a distinctive or fanciful 
name, or a designation in accordance with trade understanding. The 
statement of composition will not include any reference to a varietal 
(grape type) designation, type designation of varietal significance, 
semi-generic geographic type designation, or geographic distinctive 
designation. All parts of the designation of the wine, whether mandatory 
or optional, shall be in direct conjunction and in lettering 
substantially of the same size and kind.
    (b) An appellation of origin such as ``American,'' ``New York,'' 
``Napa Valley,'' or ``Chilean,'' disclosing the true place of origin of 
the wine, shall appear in direct conjunction with and in lettering 
substantially as conspicuous as the class and type designation if:
    (1) A varietal (grape type) designation is used under the provisions 
of Sec. 4.23;
    (2) A type designation of varietal significance is used under the 
provisions of Sec. 4.28;
    (3) A semi-generic type designation is employed as the class and 
type designation of the wine pursuant to Sec. 4.24(b);
    (4) A product name is qualified with the word ``Brand'' under the 
requirements of Sec. 4.39 (j); or
    (5) The wine is labeled with the year of harvest of the grapes, and 
otherwise conforms with the provisions of Sec. 4.27. The appellation of 
origin for vintage wine shall be other than a country.

    (a) Alcoholic content shall be stated in the case of wines 
containing more than 14 percent of alcohol by volume, and, in the case 
of wine containing 14 percent or less of alcohol by volume, either the 
type designation ``table'' wine (``light'' wine) or the alcoholic 
content shall be stated. Any statement of alcoholic content shall be 
made as prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Alcoholic content shall be stated in terms of percentage of 
alcohol by volume, and not otherwise, as provided in either paragraph 
(b)(1) or (2) of this section:
    (1) ``Alcohol ---- % by volume,'' or similar appropriate phrase; 
Provided, that if the word ``alcohol'' and/or ``volume'' are 
abbreviated, they shall be shown as ``alc.'' (alc) and/or ``vol.'' 
(vol), respectively. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, a tolerance of 1 percent, in the case of wines

[[Page 31]]

containing more than 14 percent of alcohol by volume, and of 1.5 
percent, in the case of wines containing 14 percent or less of alcohol 
by volume, will be permitted either above or below the stated 
percentage.
    (2) ``Alcohol ---- % to ---- % by volume,'' or similar appropriate 
phrase; Provided, that if the word ``alcohol'' and/or ``volume'' are 
abbreviated, they shall be shown as ``alc.'' (alc) and/or ``vol.'' 
(vol), respectively. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, a range of not more than 2 percent, in the case of wines 
containing more than 14 percent of alcohol by volume, and of not more 
than 3 percent, in the case of wines containing 14 percent or less of 
alcohol by volume, will be permitted between the minimum and maximum 
percentages stated, and no tolerances will be permitted either below 
such minimum or above such maximum.
    (c) Regardless of the type of statement used and regardless of 
tolerances normally permitted in direct statements and ranges normally 
permitted in maximum and minimum statements, alcoholic content 
statements, whether required or optional, shall definitely and correctly 
indicate the class, type and taxable grade of the wine so labeled and 
nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing the appearance 
upon the labels of any wine of an alcoholic content statement in terms 
of maximum and minimum percentages which overlaps a prescribed 
limitation on the alcoholic content of any class, type, or taxable grade 
of wine, or a direct statement of alcoholic content which indicates that 
the alcoholic content of the wine is within such a limitation when in 
fact it is not.

Sec. 4.37  Net contents.

    (a) Statement of net contents. The net contents of wine for which a 
standard of fill is prescribed in Sec. 4.73 shall be stated in the same 
manner and form as set forth in the standard of fill. The net content of 
wine for which no standard of fill is prescribed in Sec. 4.73 shall be 
stated in the metric system of measure as follows:
    (1) If more than one liter, net contents shall be stated in liters 
and in decimal portions of a liter accurate to the nearest one-hundredth 
of a liter.
    (2) If less than one liter, net contents shall be stated in 
milliliters (ml).
    (b) Statement of U.S. equivalent net contents. When net contents of 
wine are stated in metric measure, the equivalent volume in U.S. measure 
may also be shown. If shown, the U.S. equivalent volume will be shown as 
follows:
    (1) For the metric standards of fill: 3 liters (101 fl. oz.); 1.5

500 ml (16.9 fl. oz.); 375 ml (12.7 fl. oz.); 187 ml (6.3 fl. oz.); 100 
ml (3.4 fl. oz.); and 50 ml (1.7 fl. oz.).
    (2) Equivalent volumes of less than 100 fluid ounces will be stated 
in fluid ounces only, accurate to the nearest one-tenth of a fluid 
ounce; for example, 700 ml (23.7 fl. oz.).
    (3) Equivalent volumes of 100 fluid ounces or more will be stated in 
fluid ounces only, accurate to the nearest whole fluid ounce; for 
example, 6 liters (203 fl. oz.).
    (c) Net contents marked in bottle. The net contents need not be 
stated on any label if the net contents are displayed by having the same 
blown, etched, sand-blasted, marked by underglaze coloring, or otherwise 
permanently marked by any method approved by the appropriate TTB 
officer, in the sides, front, or back of the bottle, in letters and 
figures in such manner as to be plainly legible under ordinary 
circumstances, and such statement is not obscured in any manner in whole 
or in part.
    (d) Tolerances. Statement of net contents shall indicate exactly the 
volume of wine within the container, except that the following 
tolerances shall be allowed:
    (1) Discrepancies due exclusively to errors in measuring which occur 
in filling conducted in compliance with good commercial practice.
    (2) Discrepancies due exclusively to differences in the capacity of 
containers, resulting solely from unavoidable difficulties in 
manufacturing such

[[Page 32]]

containers so as to be of uniform capacity: Provided, That no greater 
tolerance shall be allowed in case of containers which, because of their 
design, cannot be made of approximately uniform capacity than is allowed 
in case of containers which can be manufactured so as to be of 
approximately uniform capacity.
    (3) Discrepancies in measure due to differences in atmospheric 
conditions in various places and which unavoidably result from the 
ordinary and customary exposure of alcoholic beverages in containers to 
evaporation. The reasonableness to discrepancies under this paragraph 
shall be determined on the facts in each case.
    (e) Unreasonable shortages. Unreasonable shortages in certain of the 
containers in any shipment shall not be compensated by overages in other 
containers in the same shipment.

blender, bottler, packer, or shipper appearing on the label need not be 
in the English language if the words ``product of'' immediately precede 
the name of the country of origin stated in accordance with customs 
requirements. Additional statements in foreign languages may be made on 
labels, if they do not in any way conflict with, or contradict the 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 4.30 through 4.39.
    (d) Location of label. Labels shall not obscure Government stamps 
nor be obscured thereby.
    (e) Labels firmly affixed. All labels shall be affixed to containers 
of wine in such manner that they cannot be removed without thorough 
application of water or other solvents.
    (f) Additional information on labels. Labels may contain information 
other than the mandatory label information required by Sec. Sec. 4.30 
through 4.39, if such information complies with the requirements of such 
sections and does not conflict with, nor in any manner qualify 
statements required by this part. In addition, information which is 
truthful, accurate, and specific, and which is neither disparaging nor 
misleading may appear on wine labels.
    (g) Representations as to materials. If any representation (other 
than representations or information required by Sec. Sec. 4.30 through 
4.39 or percentage statements required or permitted by this part) is 
made as to the presence, excellence, or other characteristic of any 
ingredient in any wine, or used in its production, the label containing 
such representation shall state, in print, type, or script, 
substantially as conspicuous as such representation,

[[Page 33]]

the name and amount in percent by volume of each such ingredient.
    (h) Statement of contents of containers. Upon request of the 
appropriate TTB officer, there shall be submitted a full and accurate 
statement of the contents of the containers to which labels are to be or 
have been affixed.

    (a) General. An individual covering, carton, or other container of 
the bottle used for sale at retail (other than a shipping container), or 
any written, printed, graphic, or other matter accompanying the bottle 
to the consumer buyer shall not contain any statement, design, device, 
or graphic, pictorial, or emblematic representation that is prohibited 
by Sec. Sec. 4.30 through 4.39 on labels.
    (b) Sealed cartons. If bottles are enclosed in sealed opaque 
coverings, cartons, or other containers used for sale at retail (other 
than a shipping container), such coverings, cartons, or other containers

container of the bottle used for sale at retail (other than a shipping 
container) is so designed that the bottle is readily removable, it may 
display any information which is not in conflict with the label on the 
bottle contained therein.
    (2) Cartons displaying brand names and/or designations must display 
such names and designations in their entirety--brand names required to 
be modified, e.g. by ``Brand'' or ``Product of U.S.A.'', must also

Sec. 4.39  Prohibited practices.

    (a) Statements on labels. Containers of wine, or any label on such 
containers, or any individual covering, carton, or other wrapper of such 
container, or any written, printed, graphic, or other matter 
accompanying such container to the consumer shall not contain:
    (1) Any statement that is false or untrue in any particular, or 
that, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, omission, or 
inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific or technical 
matter, tends to create a misleading impression.
    (2) Any statement that is disparaging of a competitor's products.
    (3) Any statement, design, device, or representation which is 
obscene or indecent.
    (4) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating 
to analyses, standards, or tests, irrespective of falsity, which the 
appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer.
    (5) Any statement, design, device or representation of or relating 
to any guarantee, irrespective of falsity, which the appropriate TTB 
officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer. Money-back 
guarantees are not prohibited.
    (6) A trade or brand name that is the name of any living individual 
of public prominence, or existing private or public organization, or is 
a name that is in simulation or is an abbreviation thereof, or any 
graphic, pictorial, or emblematic representation of any such individual 
or organization, if the use of such name or representation is likely 
falsely to lead the consumer to believe that the product has been 
endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision 
of, or in accordance with the specifications of, such individual or 
organization; Provided, That this paragraph shall not apply to the use 
of the name of any person engaged in business as a producer, blender, 
rectifier, importer, wholesaler, retailer, bottler, or warehouseman of 
wine, nor to the use by any person of a trade or brand name that is the 
name of any living individual of public prominence or existing private 
or public organization, provided such trade or brand name was used by 
him or his predecessors in interest prior to August 29, 1935.
    (7) Any statement, design, device, or representation (other than a 
statement of alcohol content in conformity with

[[Page 34]]

Sec. 4.36), which tends to create the impression that a wine:
    (i) Contains distilled spirits;
    (ii) Is comparable to a distilled spirit; or
    (iii) Has intoxicating qualities.

However, if a statement of composition is required to appear as the 
designation of a product not defined in these regulations, such 
statement of composition may include a reference to the type of 
distilled spirits contained therein.
    (8) Any coined word or name in the brand name or class and type 
designation which simulates, imitates, or which tends to create the 
impression that the wine so labeled is entitled to bear, any class, 
type, or permitted designation recognized by the regulations in this 
part unless such wine conforms to the requirements prescribed with 
respect to such designation and is in fact so designated on its labels.
    (9) Any word in the brand name or class and type designation which 
is the name of a distilled spirits product or which simulates, imitates, 
or created the impression that the wine so labeled is, or is similar to, 
any product customarily made with a distilled spirits base. Examples of 
such words are: ``Manhattan,'' ``Martini,'' and ``Daquiri'' in a class 
and type designation or brand name of a wine cocktail; ``Cuba Libre,'' 
``Zombie,'' and ``Collins'' in a class and type designation or brand 
name of a wine specialty or wine highball; ``creme,'' ``cream,'' ``de,'' 
or ``of'' when used in conjunction with ``menthe,'' ``mint,'' or 
``cacao'' in a class and type designation or a brand name of a mint or 
chocolate flavored wine specialty.
    (b) Statement of age. No statement of age or representation relative 
to age (including words or devices in any brand name or mark) shall be 
made, except (1) for vintage wine, in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 4.27; (2) references relating to methods of wine production 
involving storage or aging in accordance with Sec. 4.38(f); or (3) use 
of the word ``old'' as part of a brand name.
    (c) Statement of bottling dates. The statement of any bottling date 
shall not be deemed to be a representation relative to age, if such 
statement appears in lettering not greater than 8-point Gothic caps and 
in the following form: ``Bottled in ----'' (inserting the year in which 
the wine was bottled).
    (d) Statement of miscellaneous dates. No date, except as provided in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section with respect to statement of 
vintage year and bottling date, shall be stated on any label unless in 
addition thereto and in direct conjunction therewith in the same size 
and kind of printing, there shall be stated an explanation of the 
significance thereof such as ``established'' or ``founded in''. If any 
such date refers to the date of establishment of any business or brand 
name, it shall not be stated, in the case of containers of a capacity of 
5 liters or less, in any script, type, or printing larger than 2 
millimeters, and shall be stated in direct conjunction with the name of 
the person, company, or brand name to which it refers if the appropriate 
TTB officer finds that this is necessary in order to prevent confusion 
as to the person, company, or brand name to which the establishment date 
is applicable.
    (e) Simulation of Government stamps. (1) No labels shall be of such 
design as to resemble or simulate a stamp of the United States 
Government or any State or foreign government. No label, other than 
stamps authorized or required by the United States Government or any 
State or foreign government, shall state or indicate that the wine 
contained in the labeled container is produced, blended, bottled, 
packed, or sold under, or in accordance with, any municipal, State or 
Federal Government authorization, law, or regulation, unless such 
statement is required or specifically authorized by Federal, State or 
municipal law or regulation, or is required or specifically authorized 
by the laws or regulations of a foreign country. If the municipal, 
State, or Federal Government permit number is stated upon a label, it 
shall not be accompanied by any additional statement relating thereto.
    (2) Bonded wine cellar and bonded winery numbers may be stated but 
only in direct conjunction with the name and address of the person 
operating such wine cellar or winery. Statement of bonded wine cellar or 
winery numbers may be made in the

[[Page 35]]

following form: ``Bonded Wine Cellar No. ----'', ``Bonded Winery No. --
--'', ``B. W. C. No. ----'', ``B. W. No. ----''. No additional reference 
thereto shall be made, nor shall any use be made of such statement that 
may convey the impression that the wine has been made or matured under 
Government supervision or in accordance with Government specifications 
or standards.
    (3) If imported wines are covered by a certificate of origin and/or 
a certificate of vintage date issued by a duly authorized official of 
the appropriate foreign government, the label, except where prohibited 
by the foreign government, may refer to such certificate or the fact of 
such certification, but shall not be accompanied by any additional 
statements relating thereto. The reference to such certificate or 
certification shall be substantially in the following form:

    This product accompanied at the time of the importation by a 
certificate issued by the
________________________________________________________________________

                          (Name of government)

    government indicating that the product is
________________________________________________________________________

                 (Class and type as stated on the label)

    and (if label bears a statement of vintage date) that the wine is of 
the vintage of
________________________________________________________________________

                  (Year of vintage stated on the label)

    (f) Use of the word ``Importer'', or similar words. The word 
Importer, or similar words, shall not be stated on labels on containers 
of domestic wine except as part of the bona fide name of a permittee for 
or by whom, or of a retailer for whom, such wine is bottled, packed or 
distributed: Provided, That in all cases where such words are used as 
part of such name, there shall be stated on the same label the words 
``Product of the United States'', or similar words to negative any 
impression that the product is imported, and such negative statement 
shall appear in the same size and kind of printing as such name.
    (g) Flags, seals, coats of arms, crests, and other insignia. Labels 
shall not contain, in the brand name or otherwise, any statement, 
design, device, or pictorial representation which the appropriate TTB 
officer finds relates to, or is capable of being construed as relating 
to, the armed forces of the United States, or the American flag, or any 
emblem, seal, insignia, or decoration associated with such flag or armed 
forces; nor shall any label contain any statement, design, device, or 
pictorial representation of or concerning any flag, seal, coat of arms, 
crest or other insignia, likely to mislead the consumer to believe that 
the product has been endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or 
under the supervision of, or in accordance with the specifications of 
the government, organization, family, or individual with whom such flag, 
seal, coat of arms, crest, or insignia is associated.
    (h) Health-related statements--(1) Definitions. When used in this 
paragraph (h), terms are defined as follows:
    (i) Health-related statement means any statement related to health 
(other than the warning statement required by Sec. 16.21 of this 
chapter) and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature 
that, expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the 
consumption of alcohol, wine, or any substance found within the wine, 
and health benefits or effects on health. The term includes both 
specific health claims and general references to alleged health benefits 
or effects on health associated with the consumption of alcohol, wine, 
or any substance found within the wine, as well as health-related 
directional statements. The term also includes statements and claims 
that imply that a physical or psychological sensation results from 
consuming the wine, as well as statements and claims of nutritional 
value (e.g., statements of vitamin content). Statements concerning 
caloric, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content do not constitute 
nutritional claims about the product.
    (ii) Specific health claim is a type of health-related statement 
that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the 
wine, alcohol, or any substance found within the wine, to a disease or 
health-related condition. Implied specific health claims include 
statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that 
suggest, within the context in which

[[Page 36]]

they are presented, that a relationship exists between wine, alcohol, or 
any substance found within the wine, and a disease or health-related 
condition.
    (iii) Health-related directional statement is a type of health-
related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or 
other source for information regarding the effects on health of wine or 
alcohol consumption.
    (2) Rules for labeling--(i) Health-related statements. In general, 
labels may not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in 
any particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the 
effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will evaluate such 
statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part of the 
health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying statement 
to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related 
statement.
    (ii) Specific health claims. (A) TTB will consult with the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), as needed, on the use of a specific health 
claim on a wine label. If FDA determines that the use of such a labeling 
claim is a drug claim that is not in compliance with the requirements of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, TTB will not approve the use 
of that specific health claim on a wine label.
    (B) TTB will approve the use of a specific health claim on a wine 
label only if the claim is truthful and adequately substantiated by 
scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed and qualified with 
respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; 
adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and 
heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of 
individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health 
risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health 
claim.
    (iii) Health-related directional statements. A statement that 
directs consumers to a third party or other source for information 
regarding the effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption is 
presumed misleading unless it--
    (A) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to 
a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the 
effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption; and
    (B)(1) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement 
the following disclaimer: ``This statement should not encourage you to 
drink or to increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons;'' or
    (2) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement 
some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds 
is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the 
health-related directional statement.
    (i) Geographic brand names. (1) Except as provided in subparagraph 
2, a brand name of viticultural significance may not be used unless the 
wine meets the appellation of origin requirements for the geographic 
area named.
    (2) For brand names used in existing certificates of label approval 
issued prior to July 7, 1986:
    (i) The wine shall meet the appellation of origin requirements for 
the geographic area named; or
    (ii) The wine shall be labeled with an appellation of origin in 
accordance with Sec. 4.34(b) as to location and size of type of either:
    (A) A county or a viticultural area, if the brand name bears the 
name of a geographic area smaller than a state, or;
    (B) A state, county or a viticultural area, if the brand name bears 
a state name; or
    (iii) The wine shall be labeled with some other statement which the 
appropriate TTB officer finds to be sufficient to dispel the impression 
that the geographic area suggested by the brand name is indicative of 
the origin of the wine.
    (3) A name has viticultural significance when it is the name of a 
state or county (or the foreign equivalents), when approved as a 
viticultural area in part 9 of this chapter, or by a foreign government, 
or when found to have viticultural significance by the appropriate TTB 
officer.
    (j) Product names of geographical significance (not mandatory before 
January 1, 1983). The use of product names with specific geographical 
significance is prohibited unless the appropriate TTB officer finds that 
because of their long usage, such names are recognized by

[[Page 37]]

consumers as fanciful product names and not representations as to 
origin. In such cases the product names shall be qualified with the word 
``brand'' immediately following the product name, in the same size of 
type, and as conspicuous as the product name itself. In addition, the 
label shall bear an appellation of origin under the provisions of Sec. 
4.34(b), and, if required by the appropriate TTB officer, a statement 
disclaiming the geographical reference as a representation as to the 
origin of the wine.
    (k) Other indications of origin. Other statements, designs, devices 
or representations which indicate or infer an origin other than the true 
place of origin of the wine are prohibited.
    (l) Foreign terms. Foreign terms which: (1) Describe a particular 
condition of the grapes at the time of harvest (such as ``Auslese,'' 
``Eiswein,'' and ``Trockenbeerenauslese''); or (2) denote quality under 
foreign law (such as ``Qualitatswein'' and ``Kabinett'') may not be used 
on the labels of American wine.
    (m) Use of a vineyard, orchard, farm or ranch name. When used in a 
brand name, a vineyard, orchard, farm or ranch name having geographical 
or viticultural significance is subject to the requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 4.33(b) and 4.39(i) of this part. Additionally, the name of a 
vineyard, orchard, farm or ranch shall not be used on a wine label, 
unless 95 percent of the wine in the container was produced from primary 
winemaking material grown on the named vineyard, orchard, farm or ranch.
    (n) Use of a varietal name, type designation of varietal 
significance, semi-generic name, or geographic distinctive designation. 
Labels that contain in the brand name, product name, or distinctive or 
fanciful name, any varietal (grape type) designation, type designation 
of varietal significance, semi-generic geographic type designation, or 
geographic distinctive designation, are misleading unless the wine is 
made in accordance with the standards prescribed in classes 1, 2, or 3 
of Sec. 4.21. Any other use of such a designation on other than a class 
1, 2, or 3 wine is presumed misleading.

   Subpart E_Requirements for Withdrawal of Wine From Customs Custody


<R05>
Sec. 4.40  Label approval and release.

    (a) Certificate of label approval. No imported beverage wine in 
containers shall be released from U.S. Customs custody for consumption 
unless there is deposited with the appropriate Customs officer at the 
port of entry the original or a photostatic copy of an approved 
certificate of label approval, TTB Form 5100.31.
    (b) If the original or photostatic copy of TTB Form 5100.31 has been 
approved, the brand or lot of imported wine bearing labels identical 
with those shown thereon may be released from U.S. Customs custody.
    (c) Relabeling. Imported wine in U.S. Customs custody which is not 
labeled in conformity with certificates of label approval issued by the 
appropriate TTB officer must be relabeled prior to release under the 
supervision and direction of Customs officers of the port at which the 
wine is located.
    (d) Cross reference. For procedures regarding the issuance, denial, 
and revocation of certificates of label approval, as well as appeal 
procedures, see part 13 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 4.45  Certificates of origin, identity and proper cellar treatment.

    (a) Origin and identity. Imported wine shall not be released from 
customs custody for consumption unless the invoice is accompanied by a 
certificate of origin issued by a duly authorized official of the 
appropriate foreign government, if the issuance of such certificates 
with respect to such wine has been authorized by the foreign government 
concerned, certifying as to the identity of the wine and that the wine 
has been produced in compliance with

[[Page 38]]

the laws of the respective foreign government regulating the production 
of such wine for home consumption.
    (b) Certification of proper cellar treatment of natural wine--(1) 
General. An importer of wine may be required to have in his or her 
possession at the time of release of the wine from customs custody a 
certification or may have to comply with other conditions prescribed in 
Sec. 27.140 of this chapter regarding proper cellar treatment. If 
imported wine requires a certification under Sec. 27.140, the importer 
must provide a copy of that certification to TTB as follows:
    (i) The importer must attach a copy of the certification to the 
application for a certificate of label approval for the wine in question 
submitted under Sec. 13.21 of this chapter; or
    (ii) If a certification for the wine in question was not available 
when the importer submitted the application for label approval, the 
importer must submit a copy of the certification to the appropriate TTB 
officer prior to release from customs custody of the first shipment of 
the wine.
    (2) Validity of certification. A certification submitted under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section is valid as long as the wine is of the 
same brand and class or type, was made by the same producer, was 
subjected to the same cellar treatment, and conforms to the statements 
made on the certification. Accordingly, if the cellar treatment of the 
wine changes and a new certification under Sec. 27.140 is required, an 
importer is required to submit a new certification for the wine even 
though it is subject to the same label approval.
    (3) Use of certification. TTB may use the information from a 
certification for purposes of verifying the appropriate class and type 
designation of the wine under the labeling provisions of this part. TTB 
will make certifications submitted under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section available to the public on the TTB Internet Web site at 
www.ttb.gov.

<R05>
Sec. 4.46  Certificate of nonstandard fill.

    A person may import wine in containers not conforming to the metric 
standards of fill prescribed at Sec. 4.73 if the wine is:
    (a) Accompanied by a statement signed by a duly authorized official 
of the appropriate foreign country, stating that the wine was bottled or 
packed before January 1, 1979;
    (b) Being withdrawn from a Customs bonded warehouse into which it 
was entered before January 1, 1979; or
    (c) Exempt from the standard of fill requirements as provided by

bottled or packed, unless an approved certificate of label approval, TTB 
Form 5100.31, is issued by the appropriate TTB officer.
    (b) Any bottler or packer of wine shall be exempt from the 
requirements of this section if upon application the bottler or packer 
shows to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the wine 
to be bottled or packed is not to be sold, offered for sale, or shipped 
or delivered for shipment, or otherwise introduced in interstate or 
foreign commerce. Application for exemption shall be made on TTB Form

duplicate original of a certificate of label approval, or a certificate 
of exemption. The appropriate TTB officer will, upon the request of the 
bottler or packer, issue duplicate originals of certificates of label 
approval or of certificates of exemption if wine under the same brand is 
bottled or packed at more than one plant by the same person, and if the 
necessity for the duplicate originals is shown and there is listed with

Sec. 4.64  Prohibited practices.

    (a) Restrictions. The advertisement of wine shall not contain:
    (1) Any statement that is false or untrue in any material 
particular, or that, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, 
omission, or inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific or 
technical matter tends to create a misleading impression.
    (2) Any statement that is disparaging of a competitor's products.
    (3) Any statement, design, device, or representation which is 
obscene or indecent.
    (4) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating 
to analyses, standards, or tests, irrespective of falsity, which the 
appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer.
    (5) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating 
to any guarantee, irrespective of falsity, which the appropriate TTB 
officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer. Money-back 
guarantees are not prohibited.
    (6) Any statement that the wine is produced, blended, bottled, 
packed, or sold under, or in accordance with, any municipal, State, or 
Federal Government authorization, law, or regulations; and if a 
municipal, State, or Federal permit number is stated, the permit number 
shall not be accompanied by any additional statement relating thereto.
    (7) Any statement of bonded winecellar and bonded winery numbers 
unless stated in direct conjunction with the name and address of the 
person operating such winery or storeroom. Statement of bonded 
winecellar and bonded winery numbers may be made in the following form: 
``Bonded Winecellar No. ----,'' ``Bonded Winery No. ----,'' ``B. W. C. 
No. ----,'' ``B. W. No. ----.'' No additional reference thereto shall be 
made, nor shall any use be made of such statement that may convey the

supervision or in accordance with Government specifications or 
standards.
    (8) Any statement, design, device, or representation which relates 
to alcohol

[[Page 41]]

content or which tends to create the impression that a wine:
    (i) Contains distilled spirits; or
    (ii) Is comparable to a distilled spirit; or
    (iii) Has intoxicating qualities.

However, if a statement of composition is required to appear as the 
designation of a product not defined in these regulations, such 
statement of composition may include a reference to the type of 
distilled spirits contained therein. Further, an approved wine label, 
which bears the statement of alcohol content may be depicted in any 
advertising media, or an actual wine bottle showing the approved label 
bearing the statement of alcoholic content may be displayed in any 
advertising media.
    (9) Any word in the brand name or class and type designation which 
is the name of a distilled spirits product or which simulates, imitates, 
or creates the impression that the wine so labeled is, or is similar to, 
any product customarily made with a distilled spirits base.
    (b) Statements inconsistent with labeling. (1) Advertisements shall 
not contain any statement concerning a brand or lot of wine that is 
inconsistent with any statement on the labeling thereof.
    (2) Any label depicted on a bottle in an advertisement shall be a 
reproduction of an approved label.
    (c) Statement of age. No statement of age or representation relative 
to age (including words or devices in any brand name or mark) shall be 
made, except (1) for vintage wine, in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 4.27; (2) references in accordance with Sec. 4.38(f); or (3) use 
of the word ``old'' as part of a brand name.
    (d) Statement of bottling dates. The statement of any bottling date 
shall not be deemed to be a representation relative to age, if such 
statement appears without undue emphasis in the following form: 
``Bottled in ----'' (inserting the year in which the wine was bottled).
    (e) Statement of miscellaneous dates. No date, except as provided in 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, with respect to statement of 
vintage year and bottling date, shall be stated unless, in addition 
thereto, and in direct conjunction therewith, in the same size and kind 
of printing there shall be stated an explanation of the significance of 
such date: Provided, That if any date refers to the date of 
establishment of any business, such date shall be stated without undue 
emphasis and in direct conjunction with the name of the person to whom 
it refers.
    (f) Flags, seals, coats of arms, crests, and other insignia. No 
advertisement shall contain any statement, design, device, or pictorial 
representation of or relating to, or capable of being construed as 
relating to, the armed forces of the United States, or of the American 
flag, or of any emblem, seal, insignia, or decoration associated with 
such flag or armed forces; nor shall any advertisement contain any 
statement, device, design, or pictorial representation of or concerning 
any flag, seal, coat of arms, crest, or other insignia likely to mislead 
the consumer to believe that the product has been endorsed, made, or 
used by, or produced for, or under the supervision of, or in accordance 
with the specifications of the government, organization, family, or 
individual with whom such flag, seal, coat of arms, crests, or insignia 
is associated.
    (g) Statements indicative of origin. No statement, design, device, 
or representation which tends to create the impression that the wine 
originated in a particular place or region, shall appear in any 
advertisement unless the label of the advertised product bears an 
appellation of origin, and such appellation of origin appears in the 
advertisement in direct conjunction with the class and type designation.
    (h) Use of the word ``importer'' or similar words. The word importer 
or similar words shall not appear in advertisements of domestic wine 
except as part of the bona fide name of the permittee by or for whom, or 
of a retailer for whom, such wine is bottled, packed or distributed: 
Provided, That in all cases where such words are used as part of such 
name, there shall be stated the words ``Product of the United States'' 
or similar words to negate any impression that the product is imported, 
and such negating statements shall appear in the same size and kind of 
printing as such name.

[[Page 42]]

    (i) Health-related statements--(1) Definitions. When used in this 
paragraph (i), terms are defined as follows:
    (i) Health-related statement means any statement related to health 
and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature that, 
expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the 
consumption of alcohol, wine, or any substance found within the wine, 
and health benefits or effects on health. The term includes both 
specific health claims and general references to alleged health benefits 
or effects on health associated with the consumption of alcohol, wine, 
or any substance found within the wine, as well as health-related 
directional statements. The term also includes statements and claims 
that imply that a physical or psychological sensation results from 
consuming the wine, as well as statements and claims of nutritional 
value (e.g., statements of vitamin content). Statements concerning 
caloric, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content do not constitute 
nutritional claims about the product.
    (ii) Specific health claim is a type of health-related statement 
that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the 
wine, alcohol, or any substance found within the wine, to a disease or 
health-related condition. Implied specific health claims include 
statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that 
suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a 
relationship exists between wine, alcohol, or any substance found within 
the wine, and a disease or health-related condition.
    (iii) Health-related directional statement is a type of health-
related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or 
other source for information regarding the effects on health of wine or 
alcohol consumption.
    (2) Rules for advertising--(i) Health-related statements. In 
general, advertisements may not contain any health-related statement 
that is untrue in any particular or tends to create a misleading 
impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will 
evaluate such statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part 
of the health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying 
statement to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-
related statement. Such disclaimer or other qualifying statement must 
appear as prominent as the health-related statement.
    (ii) Specific health claims. A specific health claim will not be 
considered misleading if it is truthful and adequately substantiated by 
scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed and qualified with 
respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; 
adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and 
heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of 
individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health 
risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim 
and in a manner as prominent as the specific health claim.
    (iii) Health-related directional statements. A statement that 
directs consumers to a third party or other source for information 
regarding the effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption is 
presumed misleading unless it--
    (A) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to 
a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the 
effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption; and
    (B)(1) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, 
and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional 
statement, the following disclaimer: ``This statement should not 
encourage you to drink or increase your alcohol consumption for health 
reasons;'' or
    (2) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, 
and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional 
statement, some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB 
officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed 
by the health-related directional statement.
    (j) Confusion of brands. Two or more different brands or lots of 
wine shall not be advertised in one advertisement (or in two or more 
advertisements in one issue of a periodical or newspaper,

[[Page 43]]

or in one piece of other written, printed, or graphic matter) if the 
advertisement tends to create the impression that representations made 
as to one brand or lot apply to the other or others, and if as to such 
latter the representations contravene any provision of Sec. Sec. 4.60 
through 4.64 or are in any respect untrue.
    (k) Deceptive advertising techniques. Subliminal or similar 
techniques are prohibited. ``Subliminal or similar techniques,'' as used 
in this part, refers to any device or technique that is used to convey, 
or attempts to convey, a message to a person by means of images or 
sounds of a very brief nature that cannot be perceived at a normal level 
of awareness.

procedures. An example of a scientifically accepted procedure is

          Subpart C_Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits


<R05>
Sec. 5.21  Application of standards.

    The standards of identity for the several classes and types of 
distilled spirits set forth in this part shall be applicable only to 
distilled spirits for beverage or other nonindustrial purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 5.22  The standards of identity.

    Standards of identity for the several classes and types of distilled 
spirits set forth in this section shall be as follows (see also Sec. 
5.35, class and type):
    (a) Class 1; neutral spirits or alcohol. ``Neutral spirits'' or 
``alcohol'' are distilled spirits produced from any material at or above 
190[deg] proof, and, if bottled, bottled at not less than 80[deg] proof.
    (1) ``Vodka'' is neutral spirits so distilled, or so treated after 
distillation with charcoal or other materials, as to be without 
distinctive character, aroma, taste, or color.
    (2) ``Grain spirits'' are neutral spirits distilled from a fermented 
mash of grain and stored in oak containers.
    (b) Class 2; whisky. ``Whisky'' is an alcoholic distillate from a 
fermented mash of grain produced at less than 190[deg] proof in such 
manner that the distillate possesses the taste, aroma, and 
characteristics generally attributed to whisky, stored in oak containers 
(except that corn whisky need not be so stored), and bottled at not less 
than 80[deg] proof, and also includes mixtures of such distillates for 
which no specific standards of identity are prescribed.
    (1)(i) ``Bourbon whisky'', ``rye whisky'', ``wheat whisky'', ``malt 
whisky'', or ``rye malt whisky'' is whisky produced at not exceeding 
160[deg] proof from a fermented mash of not less than 51 percent corn, 
rye, wheat, malted barley, or malted rye grain, respectively, and stored 
at not more than 125[deg] proof in charred new oak containers; and also 
includes mixtures of such whiskies of the same type.
    (ii) ``Corn whisky'' is whisky produced at not exceeding 160[deg] 
proof from a fermented mash of not less than 80 percent corn grain, and 
if stored in oak containers stored at not more than 125[deg] proof in 
used or uncharred new oak containers and not subjected in any manner to 
treatment with charred wood; and also includes mixtures of such whisky.
    (iii) Whiskies conforming to the standards prescribed in paragraphs 
(b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, which have been stored in the type 
of oak containers prescribed, for a period of 2 years or more shall be 
further designated as ``straight''; for example, ``straight bourbon 
whisky'', ``straight

[[Page 51]]

corn whisky'', and whisky conforming to the standards prescribed in 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, except that it was produced from a 
fermented mash of less than 51 percent of any one type of grain, and 
stored for a period of 2 years or more in charred new oak containers 
shall be designated merely as ``straight whisky''. No other whiskies may 
be designated ``straight''. ``Straight whisky'' includes mixtures of 
straight whiskies of the same type produced in the same State.
    (2) ``Whisky distilled from bourbon (rye, wheat, malt, or rye malt) 
mash'' is whisky produced in the United States at not exceeding 160[deg] 
proof from a fermented mash of not less than 51 percent corn, rye, 
wheat, malted barley, or malted rye grain, respectively, and stored in 
used oak containers; and also includes mixtures of such whiskies of the 
same type. Whisky conforming to the standard of identity for corn whisky 
must be designated corn whisky.
    (3) ``Light whisky'' is whisky produced in the United States at more 
than 160[deg] proof, on or after January 26, 1968, and stored in used or 
uncharred new oak containers; and also includes mixtures of such 
whiskies. If ``light whisky'' is mixed with less than 20 percent of 
straight whisky on a proof gallon basis, the mixture shall be designated 
``blended light whisky'' (light whisky--a blend).
    (4) ``Blended whisky'' (whisky--a blend) is a mixture which contains 
straight whisky or a blend of straight whiskies at not less than 20 
percent on a proof gallon basis, excluding alcohol derived from added 
harmless coloring, flavoring or blending materials, and, separately, or 
in combination, whisky or neutral spirits. A blended whisky containing 
not less than 51 percent on a proof gallon basis of one of the types of 
straight whisky shall be further designated by that specific type of 
straight whisky; for example, ``blended rye whisky'' (rye whisky--a 
blend).
    (5)(i) ``A blend of straight whiskies'' (blended straight whiskies) 
is a mixture of straight whiskies which does not conform to the standard 
of identify for ``straight whisky.'' Products so designated may contain 
harmless coloring, flavoring, or blending materials as set forth in 27 
CFR 5.23(a).
    (ii) ``A blend of straight whiskies'' (blended straight whiskies) 
consisting entirely of one of the types of straight whisky, and not 
conforming to the standard for straight whisky, shall be further 
designated by that specific type of straight whisky; for example, ``a 
blend of straight rye whiskies'' (blended straight rye whiskies). ``A 
blend of straight whiskies'' consisting entirely of one of the types of 
straight whisky shall include straight whisky of the same type which was 
produced in the same State or by the same proprietor within the same 
State, provided that such whisky contains harmless coloring, flavoring, 
or blending materials as stated in 27 CFR 5.23(a).
    (iii) The harmless coloring, flavoring, or blending materials 
allowed under this section shall not include neutral spirits or alcohol 
in their original state. Neutral spirits or alcohol may only appear in a 
``blend of straight whiskies'' or in a ``blend of straight whiskies 
consisting entirely of one of the types of straight whisky'' as a 
vehicle for recognized flavoring of blending material.
    (6) ``Spirit whisky'' is a mixture of neutral spirits and not less 
than 5 percent on a proof gallon basis of whisky, or straight whisky, or 
straight whisky and whisky, if the straight whisky component is less 
than 20 percent on a proof gallon basis.
    (7) ``Scotch whisky'' is whisky which is a distinctive product of 
Scotland, manufactured in Scotland in compliance with the laws of the 
United Kingdom regulating the manufacture of Scotch whisky for 
consumption in the United Kingdom: Provided, That if such product is a 
mixture of whiskies, such mixture is ``blended Scotch whisky'' (Scotch 
whisky--a blend).
    (8) ``Irish whisky'' is whisky which is a distinctive product of 
Ireland, manufactured either in the Republic of Ireland or in Northern 
Ireland, in compliance with their laws regulating the manufacture of 
Irish whisky for home consumption: Provided, That if such product is a 
mixture of whiskies, such mixture is ``blended Irish whisky'' (Irish 
whisky--a blend).

[[Page 52]]

    (9) ``Canadian whisky'' is whisky which is a distinctive product of 
Canada, manufactured in Canada in compliance with the laws of Canada 
regulating the manufacture of Canadian whisky for consumption in Canada: 
Provided, That if such product is a mixture of whiskies, such mixture is 
``blended Canadian whisky'' (Canadian whisky--a blend).
    (c) Class 3; gin. ``Gin'' is a product obtained by original 
distillation from mash, or by redistillation of distilled spirits, or by 
mixing neutral spirits, with or over juniper berries and other 
aromatics, or with or over extracts derived from infusions, 
percolations, or maceration of such materials, and includes mixtures of 
gin and neutral spirits. It shall derive its main characteristic flavor 
from juniper berries and be bottled at not less than 80[deg] proof. Gin 
produced exclusively by original distillation or by redistillation may 
be further designated as ``distilled''. ``Dry gin'' (London dry gin), 
``Geneva gin'' (Hollands gin), and ``Old Tom gin'' (Tom gin) are types 
of gin known under such designations.
    (d) Class 4; brandy. ``Brandy'' is an alcoholic distillate from the 
fermented juice, mash, or wine of fruit, or from the residue thereof, 
produced at less than 190[deg] proof in such manner that the distillate 
possesses the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to 
the product, and bottled at not less than 80[deg] proof. Brandy, or 
mixtures thereof, not conforming to any of the standards in paragraphs 
(d) (1) through (8) of this section shall be designated as ``brandy'', 
and such designation shall be immediately followed by a truthful and 
adequate statement of composition.
    (1) ``Fruit brandy'' is brandy distilled solely from the fermented 
juice or mash of whole, sound, ripe fruit, or from standard grape, 
citrus, or other fruit wine, with or without the addition of not more 
than 20 percent by weight of the pomace of such juice or wine, or 30 
percent by volume of the lees of such wine, or both (calculated prior to 
the addition of water to facilitate fermentation or distillation). Fruit 
brandy shall include mixtures of such brandy with not more than 30 
percent (calculated on a proof gallon basis) of lees brandy. Fruit 
brandy, derived from grapes, shall be designated as ``grape brandy'' or 
``brandy'', except that in the case of brandy (other than neutral 
brandy, pomace brandy, marc brandy or grappa brandy) distilled from the 
fermented juice, mash, or wine of grapes, or the residue thereof, which 
has been stored in oak containers for less than 2 years, the statement 
of class and type shall be immediately preceded, in the same size and 
kind of type, by the word ``immature''. Fruit brandy, other than grape 
brandy, derived from one variety of fruit, shall be designated by the 
word ``brandy'' qualified by the name of such fruit (for example, 
``peach brandy''), except that ``apple brandy'' may be designated 
``applejack''. Fruit brandy derived from more than one variety of fruit 
shall be designated as ``fruit brandy'' qualified by a truthful and 
adequate statement of composition.
    (2) ``Cognac'', or ``Cognac (grape) brandy'', is grape brandy 
distilled in the Cognac region of France, which is entitled to be so 
designated by the laws and regulations of the French Government.
    (3) ``Dried fruit brandy'' is brandy that conforms to the standard 
for fruit brandy except that it has been derived from sound, dried 
fruit, or from the standard wine of such fruit. Brandy derived from 
raisins, or from raisin wine, shall be designated as ``raisin brandy''. 
Other brandies shall be designated in the same manner as fruit brandy 
from the corresponding variety or varieties of fruit except that the 
name of the fruit shall be qualified by the word ``dried''.
    (4) ``Lees brandy'' is brandy distilled from the lees of standard 
grape, citrus, or other fruit wine, and shall be designated as ``lees 
brandy'', qualified by the name of the fruit from which such lees are 
derived.
    (5) ``Pomace brandy'', or ``marc brandy'', is brandy distilled from 
the skin and pulp of sound, ripe grapes, citrus or other fruit, after 
the withdrawal of the juice or wine therefrom, and shall be designated 
as ``pomace brandy'', or ``marc brandy'', qualified by the name of the 
fruit from which derived. Grape pomace brandy may be designated as 
``grappa'' or ``grappa brandy''.

[[Page 53]]

distinctive

[[Page 55]]

types of distilled spirits (other than names found by the appropriate 
TTB officer under paragraph (k)(2) of this section to have become 
generic) shall not be applied to distilled spirits produced in any other 
place than the particular region indicated by the name, unless (i) in 
direct conjunction with the name there appears the word ``type'' or the 
word ``American'' or some other adjective indicating the true place of 
production, in lettering substantially as conspicuous as such name, and 
(ii) the distilled spirits to which the name is applied conform to the 
distilled spirits of that particular region. The following are examples 
of distinctive types of distilled spirits with geographical names that 
have not become generic: Eau de Vie de Dantzig (Danziger Goldwasser), 
Ojen, Swedish punch. Geographical names for distinctive types of 
distilled spirits shall be used to designate only distilled spirits 
conforming to the standard of identity, if any, for such type specified 
in this section, or if no such standard is so specified, then in 
accordance with the trade understanding of that distinctive type.
    (2) Only such geographical names for distilled spirits as the 
appropriate TTB officer finds have by usage and common knowledge lost 
their geographical significance to such extent that they have become 
generic shall be deemed to have become generic. Examples at London dry 
gin, Geneva (Hollands) gin.
    (3) Geographical names that are not names for distinctive types of 
distilled spirits, and that have not become generic, shall not be 
applied to distilled spirits produced in any other place than the 
particular place or region indicated in the name. Examples are Cognac, 
Armagnac, Greek brandy, Pisco brandy, Jamaica rum, Puerto Rico rum, 
Demerara rum.

and similar words connoting, indicating, or commonly associated with 
Scotland, shall not be used to designate any product not wholly produced 
in Scotland.
    (l) Class 12; products without geographical designations but 
distinctive of a particular place. (1) The whiskies of the types 
specified in paragraphs (b) (1), (4), (5), and (6) of this section are 
distinctive products of the United States and if produced in a foreign 
country shall be designated by the applicable designation prescribed in 
such paragraphs, together with the words ``American type'' or the words 
``produced (distilled, blended) in ----'', the blank to be filled in 
with the name of the foreign country: Provided, That the word 
``bourbon'' shall not be used to describe any whisky or whisky-based 
distilled spirits not produced in the United States. If whisky of any of 
these types is composed in part of whisky or whiskies produced in a 
foreign country there shall be stated, on the brand label, the 
percentage of such whisky and the country of origin thereof.
    (2) The name for other distilled spirits which are distinctive 
products of a particular place or country, an example is Habanero, shall 
not be given to the product of any other place or country unless the 
designation for such product includes the word ``type'' or an adjective 
such as ``American'', or the like, clearly indicating the true place of 
production. The provision for place of production shall not apply to 
designations which by usage and common knowledge have lost their 
geographical significance to such an extent that the appropriate TTB 
officer finds they have become generic. Examples are Slivovitz, 
Zubrovka, Aquavit, Arrack, and Kirschwasser.

Sec. 5.23  Alteration of class and type.

    (a) Additions. (1) The addition of any coloring, flavoring, or 
blending materials to any class and type of distilled spirits, except as 
otherwise provided in this section, alters the class and type thereof 
and the product shall be appropriately redesignated.
    (2) There may be added to any class or type of distilled spirits, 
without changing the class or type thereof, (i) such harmless coloring, 
flavoring, or blending materials as are an essential component part of 
the particular class

[[Page 56]]

or type of distilled spirits to which added, and (ii) harmless coloring, 
flavoring, or blending materials such as caramel, straight malt or 
straight rye malt whiskies, fruit juices, sugar, infusion of oak chips 
when approved by the Administrator, or wine, which are not an essential 
component part of the particular distilled spirits to which added, but 
which are customarily employed therein in accordance with established 
trade usage, if such coloring, flavoring, or blending materials do not 
total more than 2\1/2\ percent by volume of the finished product.
    (3) ``Harmless coloring, flavoring, and blending materials'' shall 
not include (i) any material which would render the product to which it 
is added an imitation, or (ii) any material, other than caramel, 
infusion of oak chips, and sugar, in the case of Cognac brandy; or (iii) 
any material whatsoever in the case of neutral spirits or straight 
whiskey, except that vodka may be treated with sugar in an amount not to 
exceed 2 grams per liter and a trace amount of citric acid.
    (b) Extractions. The removal from any distilled spirits of any 
constituents to such an extent that the product does not possess the 
taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to that class or 
type of distilled spirits alters the class and type thereof, and the 
product shall be appropriately redesignated. In addition, in the case of 
straight whisky the removal of more than 15 percent of the fixed acids, 
or volatile acids, or esters, or soluble solids, or higher alcohols, or 
more than 25 percent of the soluble color, shall be deemed to alter the 
class or type thereof.
    (c) Exceptions. (1) This section shall not be construed as in any 
manner modifying the standards of identity for cordials and liqueurs, 
flavored brandy, flavored gin, flavored rum, flavored vodka, and 
flavored whisky or as authorizing any product which is defined in Sec. 
5.22(j), Class 10, as an imitation to be otherwise designated.

affixed to the container. However, if any one major food allergen is 
voluntarily declared, all major food allergens used in production of the 
distilled spirit product, including major food allergens used as fining 
or processing agents, must be declared, except when covered by a 
petition for exemption approved by the appropriate TTB officer under 
Sec. 5.32b. The major food allergens declaration must consist of the 
word ``Contains'' followed by a colon and the name of the food source 
from which each major food allergen is derived (for example, ``Contains: 
egg'').
    (c) Cross reference. For mandatory labeling requirements applicable 
to distilled spirits products containing FD&C Yellow No. 5 and sulfites, 
see Sec. Sec. 5.32(b)(5) and (7).

Sec. 5.32b  Petitions for exemption from major food allergen labeling.

    (a) Submission of petition. Any person may petition the appropriate 
TTB officer to exempt a particular product or class of products from the 
labeling requirements of Sec. 5.32a. The burden is on the petitioner to 
provide scientific evidence (including the analytical method used to 
produce the evidence) that demonstrates that the finished product or 
class of products, as derived by the method specified in the petition, 
either:
    (1) Does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human 
health; or

[[Page 60]]

    (2) Does not contain allergenic protein derived from one of the 
foods identified in Sec. 5.32a(a)(1)(i), even though a major food 
allergen was used in production.
    (b) Decision on petition. TTB will approve or deny a petition for 
exemption submitted under paragraph (a) of this section in writing 
within 180 days of receipt of the petition. If TTB does not provide a 
written response to the petitioner within that 180-day period, the 
petition will be deemed denied, unless an extension of time for decision 
is mutually agreed upon by the appropriate TTB officer and the 
petitioner. TTB may confer with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
on petitions for exemption, as appropriate and as FDA resources permit. 
TTB may require the submission of product samples and other additional 
information in support of a petition; however, unless required by TTB, 
the submission of samples or additional information by the petitioner 
after submission of the petition will be treated as the withdrawal of 
the initial petition and the submission of a new petition. An approval 
or denial under this section will constitute a final agency action.
    (c) Resubmission of a petition. After a petition for exemption is 
denied under this section, the petitioner may resubmit the petition 
along with supporting materials for reconsideration at any time. TTB 
will treat this submission as a new petition for purposes of the time 
frames for decision set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Availability of information--(1) General. TTB will promptly post 
to its public Web site, http://www.ttb.gov, all petitions received under 
this section as well as TTB's responses to those petitions. Any 
information submitted in support of the petition that is not posted to 
the TTB Web site will be available to the public pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552, except where a request for confidential treatment is granted under 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (2) Requests for confidential treatment of business information. A 
person who provides trade secrets or other commercial or financial 
information in connection with a petition for exemption under this 
section may request that TTB give confidential treatment to that 
information. A failure to request confidential treatment at the time the 
information in question is submitted to TTB will constitute a waiver of 
confidential treatment. A request for confidential treatment of 
information under this section must conform to the following standards:
    (i) The request must be in writing;
    (ii) The request must clearly identify the information to be kept 
confidential;
    (iii) The request must relate to information that constitutes trade 
secrets or other confidential commercial or financial information 
regarding the business transactions of an interested person, the 
disclosure of which would cause substantial harm to the competitive 
position of that person;
    (iv) The request must set forth the reasons why the information 
should not be disclosed, including the reasons the disclosure of the 
information would prejudice the competitive position of the interested 
person; and
    (v) The request must be supported by a signed statement by the 
interested person, or by an authorized officer or employee of that 
person, certifying that the information in question is a trade secret or 
other confidential commercial or financial information and that the 
information is not already in the public domain.

Sec. 5.34  Brand names.

    (a) Misleading brand names. No label shall contain any brand name, 
which, standing alone, or in association with other printed or graphic 
matter, creates any impression or inference as to the age, origin, 
identity, or other characteristics of the product unless the appropriate 
TTB officer finds that such brand name (when appropriately qualified if 
required) conveys no erroneous impressions as to the age, origin, 
identity, or other characteristics of the product.
    (b) Trade name of foreign origin. Paragraph (a) of this section does 
not prohibit the use by any person of any trade name or brand of foreign

29, 1935, which has been used by such person or his predecessors in the 
United States for a period of at least 5 years immediately preceding 
August 29, 1935: Provided, That if such trade name or brand is used, the 
designation of the product shall be qualified by the name of the 
locality in the United States in which produced, and such qualification 
shall be in script, type, or printing as conspicuous as the trade name 
or brand.


<R05>
Sec. 5.35  Class and type.

    (a) Designation of product. The class and type of distilled spirits 
shall be stated in conformity with Sec. 5.22 if defined therein. In all 
other instances the product shall be designated in accordance with trade 
and consumer understanding thereof, or, if no such understanding exists, 
by a distinctive or fanciful name, and in either case (except as 
provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this

[[Page 62]]

section) followed by a truthful and adequate statement of composition. 
The word ``cordial'' or ``liqueur'' need not be stated in the case of 
cordials and liqueurs unless the appropriate TTB officer finds such word 
is necessary to clearly indicate that the product is a cordial or 
liqueur.
    (b) Products designed in accordance with trade and consumer 
understanding. In the case of products designated in accordance with 
trade and consumer understanding:
    (1) A statement of the classes and types of distilled spirits used 
in the manufacture thereof shall be deemed a sufficient statement of 
composition in the case of highballs, cocktails, and similar prepared 
specialties when the designation adequately indicates to the consumer 
the general character of the product.
    (2) No statement of composition is required if the designation 
through general and established usage adequately indicates to the 
consumer the composition of the product.

A product shall not bear a designation which indicates it contains a 
class or type of distilled spirits unless the distilled spirits therein 
conform to such class and type.
    (c) Origin of whiskies in mixtures. In the case of any of the types 
of whisky defined in Sec. 5.22(b), Class 2, which contains any whisky 
or whiskies produced in a country other than that indicated by the type 
designation, there shall be stated on the brand label the percentage of 
such whisky and the country or origin thereof. In the case of mixtures 
of whisky, not conforming to any type designation in Sec. 5.22(b), 
Class 2, the components of which were distilled in more than one 
country, there shall be stated in direct conjunction with the class 
designation ``whisky'' a truthful and adequate statement of the 
composition of the product.
    (d) Whisky manufactured in Scotland, Ireland, or Canada. All whisky 
manufactured in Scotland, Ireland, or Canada, shall be deemed to be 
Scotch, Irish, or Canadian whisky, and shall be so designated, in 
conformity with Sec. 5.22(b) (7), (8), and (9), unless the application 
of such designation to the particular product will result in consumer 
deception, or unless such a product is not entitled to such designation 
under the laws of the country in which manufactured.
    (e) Cordials and liqueurs. The alcoholic components of cordails and 
liqueurs may, but need not, be stated on labels.


<R05>
Sec. 5.36  Name and address.

    (a) ``Bottled by''. (1) On labels of domestic distilled spirits 
there shall be stated the phrase ``bottled by'', ``packed by'', or 
``filled by'', immediately followed by the name (or trade name) of the 
bottler and the place where such distilled spirits are bottled. If the 
bottler is the actual bona fide operator of more than one distilled 
spirits plant engaged in bottling operations, there may, in addition, be 
stated immediately following the name (or trade name) of such bottler 
the addresses of such other plants.
    (2) Where distilled spirits are bottled by or for the distiller 
thereof, there may be stated, in lieu of the phrase ``bottled by'', 
``packed by'', or ``filled by'', followed by the bottler's name (or 
trade name) and address, the phrase ``distilled by'', followed by the 
name, or the trade name under which the particular spirits were 
distilled, or (except in the case of distilled spirits labeled as 
bottled in bond) any trade name shown on the distiller's permit 
(covering the premises where the particular spirits were distilled), and 
the address (or addresses) of the distiller.
    (3) Where ``straight whiskies'' of the same type which have been 
produced in the same State by two or more different distillers are 
combined (either at time of bottling or at a warehouseman's bonded 
premises for further storage) and subsequently bottled and labeled as 
``straight whisky,'' such ``straight whisky'' shall be labeled in 
accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. 
Where such ``straight whisky'' is bottled by or for the distillers 
thereof, there may be stated on the label, in lieu of the requirements 
of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the phraise ``distilled by,'' 
followed by the names (or trade names) of the different distillers who 
distilled a portion of the ``straight whisky,'' the addresses of the 
distilleries where the ``straight whisky'' was distilled, and

[[Page 63]]

the percentage of ``straight whisky'' distilled by each distiller (with 
a tolerance of plus or minus 2 percent). In the case where ``straight 
whisky'' is made up of a mixture of ``straight whiskies'' of the same 
type from two or more different distilleries of the same proprietor 
located within the same State, and where the ``straight whisky'' is 
bottled by or for the proprietor thereof, such ``straight whisky'' may 
be labeled, in lieu of the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of the this 
section, with the phrase ``distilled by'' followed by the name (or trade 
name) of the proprietor and the addresses of the different distilleries 
which distilled a portion of the ``straight whisky.''
    (4) Where distilled spirits are bottled by or for the rectifier 
thereof, there may be stated, in lieu of the phrase ``bottled by'', 
``packed by'', or ``filled by'', followed by the bottler's name (or 
trade name) and address, the phrases ``blended by'', ``made by'', 
``prepared by'', ``manufactured by'', or ``produced by'' (whichever may 
be appropriate to the act of rectification involved) followed by the 
name (or trade name), and the address (or addresses) of the rectifier.
    (5) In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) 
of this paragraph, the labels of bottled in bond spirits shall bear the 
real name of the distillery or the trade name under which the distillery 
produced and warehoused the spirits, the number of the plant in which 
produced and the number of the plant in which bottled.
    (6) The label may state the address of the proprietor's principal 
place of business in lieu of the place where the bottling, distilling or 
rectification operation occurred, if the address where the operation 
occurred is indicated by printing, coding, or other markings, on the 
label or on the bottle.
    (b) ``Imported by''. (1) On labels of imported distilled spirits, 
bottled prior to importation, there shall be stated the words ``imported 
by'', ``imported exclusively by'', or a similar appropriate phrase, and 
immediately thereafter the name of the importer, or exclusive agent, or 
sole distributor, or other person responsible for the importation, 
together with the principal place of business in the United States of 
such person.
    (2) On labels of imported distilled spirits bottled after 
importation there shall be stated:
    (i) The name of the bottler and place where bottled, immediately 
preceded by the words ``bottled by'', ``packed by'', or ``filled by''; 
or
    (ii) The name of the bottler and place where bottled, immediately 
preceded by the words ``bottled by'', ``packed by'', or ``filled by'' 
and in conjunction therewith the name and address of the person

(b)(1) of this section; or
    (iii) The name and principal place of business in the United States 
of the person responsible for the importation, if the spirits are 
bottled for such person, immediately preceded by the phrase ``imported 
by and bottled (packed), (filled) in the United States for'' (or a 
similar appropriate phrase); or,
    (iv) In the case of imported distilled spirits bottled after 
importation by the person responsible for the importation, the words 
``imported and bottled (packed), (filled) by'', ``imported and bottled 
(packed), (filled) exclusively by'', or a similar appropriate phrase, 
and immediately thereafter the name of such person and the address of 
the place where bottled or the address of such person's principal place 
of business.
    (c) Post office address. The ``place'' stated shall be the post 
office address, except that the street address may be omitted. No 
additional places or addresses shall be stated for the same person, firm 
or corporation, unless (1) such person or retailer is actively engaged 
in the conduct of an additional bona fide and actual alcoholic beverage 
business at such additional place or address, and (2) the label also 
contains in direct conjunction therewith, appropriate descriptive 
material indicating the function occurring at such additional place or 
address.
    (d) State of distillation. Except in the case of ``light whisky'', 
``blended light whisky'', ``blended whisky'', ``a blend of straight 
whiskies'', or ``spirit whisky'', the State of distillation shall be

[[Page 64]]

shown on the label of any whisky produced in the United States if the 
whisky is not distilled in the State given in the address on the brand 
label. The appropriate TTB officer may, however, require the State of 
distillation to be shown on the label or he may permit such other 
labeling as may be necessary to negate any misleading or deceptive 
impression which might be created as to the actual State of 
distillation. In the case of ``light whisky'', as defined in Sec. 
5.22(b)(3), the State of distillation shall not appear in any manner on 
any label, when the appropriate TTB officer finds such State is 
associated by consumers with an American type whisky, except as a part 
of a name and address as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (e) Country of origin. On labels of imported distilled spirits there 
shall be stated the country of origin in substantially the following 
form ``Product of ------------'', the blank to be filled in with the 
name of the country of origin.

label must be identical to the trade name listed on the permittee's 
basic permit.

distilled spirits shall be stated in percent-alcohol-by-volume. Products 
such as ``Rock and Rye. or similar products containing a significant 
amount of solid material shall state the alcohol content at the time of 
bottling as follows: ``Bottled at ------ percent-alcohol-by-volume.''
    (2) Optional statement. In addition, the label may also state the 
alcohol content in degrees of proof if this information appears in 
direct conjunction (i.e. with no intervening material) with the 
statement expressed in percent-alcohol-by-volume. If both forms of 
alcohol content are shown, the optional statement in degrees of proof 
shall be placed in parentheses, in brackets, or otherwise distinguished 
from the mandatory statement in percent-alcohol-by-by-volume to 
emphasize the fact that both expressions of alcohol content mean the 
same thing.
    (b) Tolerances. The following tolerances shall be allowed (without 
affecting the labeled statement of alcohol content) for losses of 
alcohol content occurring during bottling:
    (1) Not to exceed 0.25 percent alcohol by volume for spirits 
containing solids in excess of 600 mg per 100 ml; or
    (2) Not to exceed 0.25 percent alcohol by volume for any spirits 
product bottled in 50 or 100 ml size bottles; or

and the youngest other whisky. In lieu of the foregoing, a statement may 
be made of the ages and percentages of each of the straight whiskies and 
other whiskies contained in the blend: ``---- percent straight whisky --
-- years old, ---- percent straight whisky ---- years old, ---- percent 
whisky ---- years old, and ---- percent whisky ---- years old.''
    (3) In the case of imported whiskies described in Sec. 5.22(l), 
Class 12, the labels shall state the ages and percentages in the same 
manner and form as is required for the same type of whisky produced in 
the United States.
    (4) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, in 
the case of whisky produced in the United States and stored in reused 
oak containers, except for corn whisky, and for light whisky produced on 
or after January 26, 1968, there shall be stated in lieu of the words 
``---- years old'' the period of storage in reused oak containers as 
follows: ``---- stored ---- years in reused cooperage.''
    (5) Optional age statements shall appear in the same form as 
required age statements.
    (b) Statements of age for rum, brandy, and Tequila. Age may, but 
need not, be stated on labels of rums, brandies, and Tequila, except 
that an appropriate statement with respect to age shall appear on the 
brand label in case of brandy (other than immature brandies and fruit 
brandies which are not customarily stored in oak containers) not stored 
in oak containers for a period of at least 2 years. If age is stated, it 
shall be substantially as follows: ``---- years old''; the blank to be 
filled in with the age of the youngest distilled spirits in the product.
    (c) Statement of storage for grain spirits. In case of grain 
spirits, the period of storage in oak containers may be stated in 
immediate conjunction with the required percentage statement; for 
example, ``----% grain spirits stored ---- years in oak containers.''
    (d) Other distilled spirits. Age, maturity, or similar statements or 
representations as to neutral spirits (except for grain spirits as 
stated in paragraph (c) of this section), gin, liqueurs, cordials, 
cocktails, highballs, bitters, flavored brandy, flavored gin, flavored 
rum, flavored vodka, flavored whisky, and specialties are misleading and 
are prohibited from being stated on any label.
    (e) Miscellaneous age representations. (1) Age may be understated 
but shall not be overstated.
    (2) If any age, maturity, or similar representation is made relative 
to any distilled spirits (such representations for products enumerated 
in paragraph (d) of this section are prohibited), the age shall also be 
stated on all labels where such representation appears, and in a manner 
substantially as conspicuous as such representation: Provided. That the 
use of the word ``old'' or

[[Page 67]]

other word denoting age, as part of the brand name, shall not be deemed 
to be an age representation: And provided further, That the labels of 
whiskies and brandies (except immature brandies) not required to bear a 
statement of age, and rum and Tequila aged for not less than 4 years, 
may contain general inconspicuous age, maturity or similar 
representations without the label bearing an age statement.

Sec. 5.42  Prohibited practices.

    (a) Statements on labels. Bottles containing distilled spirits, or 
any labels on such bottles, or any individual covering, carton, or other 
container of such bottles used for sale at retail, or any written, 
printed, graphic, or other matter accompanying such bottles to the 
consumer shall not contain:
    (1) Any statement that is false or untrue in any particular, or 
that, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, omission, or 
inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific or technical 
matter, tends to create a misleading impression.
    (2) Any statement that is disparaging of a competitor's product.
    (3) Any statement, design, device, or representation which is 
obscene or indecent.
    (4) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating 
to analyses, standards, or tests, irrespective of falsity, which the 
appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer.
    (5) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating 
to any guarantee, irrespective of falsity, which the appropriate TTB 
officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer. Money-back 
guarantees are not prohibited.
    (6) A trade or brand name that is the name of any living individual 
of public prominence, or existing private or public organization, or is 
a name that is in simulation or is an abbreviation thereof, or any 
graphic, pictorial, or emblematic representation of any such individual 
or organization, if the use of such name or representation is likely to 
falsely lead the consumer to believe that the product has been endorsed, 
made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision of, or in 
accordance with the specifications of, such individual or organization: 
Provided, That this paragraph shall not apply to the use of the name of 
any person engaged in business as a distiller, rectifier, blender, or 
other producer, or as an importer, wholesaler, retailer, bottler, or 
warehouseman, of distilled spirits, nor to the use by any person of a 
trade or brand name that is the name

[[Page 68]]

of any living individual of public prominence or existing private or 
public organization, provided such trade or brand name was used by him 
or his predecessors in interest prior to August 29, 1935.
    (b) Miscellaneous. (1) Labels shall not be of such design as to 
resemble or simulate a stamp of the U.S. Government or any State or 
foreign government. Labels, other than stamps authorized or required by 
this or any other government, shall not state or indicate that the 
distilled spirits are distilled, blended, made, bottled, or sold under, 
or in accordance with, any municipal, State, Federal, or foreign 
authorization, law, or regulations, unless such statement is required or 
specifically authorized by Federal, State, municipal, or foreign law or 
regulations. The statements authorized by this part to appear on labels 
for domestic distilled spirits are ``Distilled (produced, barreled, 
warehoused, blended, or bottled, or any combination thereof, as the case 
may be) under United States (U.S.) Government supervision'', or in the 
case of distilled spirits labeled as bottled in bond, ``Bottled in bond 
under United States (U.S.) Government supervision''. If the municipal, 
State, or Federal Government permit number is stated on a label, it 
shall not be accompanied by any additional statement relating thereto.
    (2) If imported distilled spirits are covered by a certificate of 
origin or of age issued by a duly authorized official of the appropriate 
foreign government, the label, except where prohibited by the foreign 
government, may refer to such certificate or the fact of such 
certification, but shall not be accompanied by any additional statement 
relating thereto. The reference to such certificate or certification 
shall, in the case of Cognac, be substantially in the following form: 
``This product accompanied at the time of importation by an `Acquit 
Regional Jaune d'Or' issued by the French Government, indicating that 
this grape brandy was distilled in the Cognac Region of France''; and in 
the case of other distilled spirits, substantially in the following 
form: ``This product accompanied at time of importation by a certificate 
issued by the ---- government (name of government) indicating that the 
product is ---- (class and type as required to be stated on the label), 
and (if label claims age) that none of the distilled spirits are of an 
age less than stated on this label.''
    (3) The words ``bond'', ``bonded'', ``bottled in bond'', ``aged in 
bond'', or phrases containing these or synonymous terms, shall not be 
used on any label or as part of the brand name of domestic distilled 
spirits unless the distilled spirits are:
    (i) Composed of the same kind of spirits produced from the same 
class of materials;
    (ii) Produced in the same distilling season by the same distiller at 
the same distillery;
    (iii) Stored for at least four years in wooden containers wherein 
the spirits have been in contact with the wood surface except for gin 
and vodka which must be stored for at least four years in wooden 
containers coated or lined with paraffin or other substance which will 
preclude contact of the spirits with the wood surface;
    (iv) Unaltered from their original condition or character by the 
addition or subtraction of any substance other than by filtration, chill 
proofing, or other physical treatments (which do not involve the 
addition of any substance which will remain incorporated in the finished 
product or result in a change in class or type);
    (v) Reduced in proof by the addition of pure water only to 100 
degrees of proof; and
    (vi) Bottles at 100 degrees of proof.

In addition to the requirements of Sec. 5.36(a) (1) or (2), the label 
shall bear the real name of the distillery or the trade name under which 
the distillery produced and warehoused the spirits, and the plant (or 
registered distillery) number in which produced; and the plant number in 
which bottled. The label may also bear the name or trade name of the 
bottler.
    (4) The words ``bond'', ``bonded'', ``bottled in bond'', ``aged in 
bond'', or phrases containing these or synonymous terms, shall not be 
used on any label or as part of the brand name of imported distilled 
spirits unless the distilled spirits meet in all respects the 
requirements applicable to distilled

[[Page 69]]

spirits bottled for domestic consumption, so labeled, and unless the 
laws and regulations of the country in which such distilled spirits are 
produced authorize the bottling of distilled spirits in bond and require 
or specifically authorize such distilled spirits to be so labeled. All 
spirits labeled as ``bonded'', ``bottled in bond'', or ``aged in bond'' 
pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall bear in direct 
conjunction with such statement and in script, type, or printing 
substantially as conspicuous as that used on such statement, the name of 
the country under whose laws and regulations such distilled spirits were 
so bottled.
    (5) The word ``pure'' shall not be stated upon labels unless:
    (i) It refers to a particular ingredient used in the production of 
the distilled spirits, and is a truthful representation about that 
ingredient; or
    (ii) It is part of the bona fide name of a permittee or retailer for 
whom the distilled spirits are bottled; or
    (iii) It is part of the bona fide name of the permittee who bottled 
the distilled spirits.
    (6) Distilled spirits shall not be labeled as ``double distilled'' 
or ''triple distilled'' or any similar term unless it is a truthful 
statement of fact; except that ``double distilled'' or ``triple 
distilled'' shall not be permitted on labels of distilled spirits 
produced by the redistillation method when a second or third 
distillation step is a necessary distillation process for the production 
of the product.
    (7) Labels shall not contain any statement, design, device, or 
pictorial representation which the appropriate TTB officer finds relates 
to, or is capable of being construed as relating to, the armed forces of 
the United States, or the American flag, or any emblem, seal, insignia, 
or decoration associated with such flag or armed forces; nor shall any 
label contain any statement, design, device, or pictorial representation 
of or concerning any flag, seal, coat of arms, crest or other insignia, 
likely to mislead the consumer to believe that the product has been 
endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision 
of, or in accordance with the specifications of the government, 
organization, family, or individual with whom such flag, seal, coat of 
arms, crest, or insignia is associated.
    (8) Health-related statements--(i) Definitions. When used in this 
paragraph (b)(8), terms are defined as follows:
    (A) Health-related statement means any statement related to health 
(other than the warning statement required by Sec. 16.21 of this 
chapter) and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature 
that, expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the 
consumption of alcohol, distilled spirits, or any substance found within 
the distilled spirits, and health benefits or effects on health. The 
term includes both specific health claims and general references to 
alleged health benefits or effects on health associated with the 
consumption of alcohol, distilled spirits, or any substance found within 
the distilled spirits, as well as health-related directional statements. 
The term also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical 
or psychological sensation results from consuming the distilled spirits, 
as well as statements and claims of nutritional value (e.g., statements 
of vitamin content). Statements concerning caloric, carbohydrate, 
protein, and fat content do not constitute nutritional claims about the 
product.
    (B) Specific health claim is a type of health-related statement 
that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the 
distilled spirits, alcohol, or any substance found within the distilled 
spirits, to a disease or health-related condition. Implied specific 
health claims include statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of 
communication that suggest, within the context in which they are 
presented, that a relationship exists between distilled spirits, 
alcohol, or any substance found within the distilled spirits, and a 
disease or health-related condition.
    (C) Health-related directional statement is a type of health-related 
statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or other 
source for information regarding the effects on health of distilled 
spirits or alcohol consumption.
    (ii) Rules for labeling--(A) Health-related statements. In general, 
labels may

[[Page 70]]

not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in any 
particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the effects 
on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will evaluate such statements on a 
case-by-case basis and may require as part of the health-related 
statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying statement to dispel any 
misleading impression conveyed by the health-related statement.
    (B) Specific health claims. (1) TTB will consult with the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), as needed, on the use of a specific health 
claim on a distilled spirits label. If FDA determines that the use of 
such a labeling claim is a drug claim that is not in compliance with the 
requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, TTB will not 
approve the use of that specific health claim on a distilled spirits 
label.
    (2) TTB will approve the use of a specific health claim on a 
distilled spirits label only if the claim is truthful and adequately 
substantiated by scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed 
and qualified with respect to the categories of individuals to whom the 
claim applies; adequately discloses the health risks associated with 
both moderate and heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines 
the categories of individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption 
may cause health risks. This information must appear as part of the 
specific health claim.
    (C) Health-related directional statements. A statement that directs 
consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the 
effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol consumption is 
presumed misleading unless it--
    (1) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to 
a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the 
effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol consumption; and
    (2)(i) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement 
the following disclaimer: ``This statement should not encourage you to 
drink or to increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons;'' or
    (ii) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement 
some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds 
is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the 
health-related directional statement.

Sec. 5.46  Standard liquor bottles.

    (a) General. A standard liquor bottle shall be one so made and 
formed, and so filled, as not to mislead the purchaser. An individual 
carton or other container of a bottle shall not be so designed as to 
mislead purchasers as to the size of the bottles.
    (b) Headspace. A liquor bottle of a capacity of 200 milliliters or 
more shall be held to be so filled as to mislead the purchaser if it has 
a headspace in excess of 8 percent of the total capacity of the bottle 
after closure.
    (c) Design. A liquor bottle shall be held (irrespective of the 
correctness of the stated net contents) to be so made and formed as to 
mislead the purchaser, if its actual capacity is substantially less than 
the capacity it appears to have upon visual examination under ordinary 
conditions of purchase or use.

[[Page 71]]

    (d) Exceptions--(1) Distinctive liquor bottles. The headspace and 
design requirements in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section do not 
apply to liquor bottles that are specifically exempted by the 
appropriate TTB officer, pursuant to an application filed by the bottler 
or importer.
    (2) Cross reference. For procedures regarding the issuance, denial 
and revocation of distinctive liquor bottle approvals, as well as appeal 
procedures, see part 13 of this chapter.

1 pint.                               \1/16\ pint (brandy only).
 

    (b) Tolerances. The following tolerances shall be allowed:
    (1) Discrepancies due to errors in measuring which occur in filling 
conducted in compliance with good commercial practice.
    (2) Discrepancies due to differences in the capacity of bottles, 
resulting solely from unavoidable difficulties in manufacturing such 
bottles to a uniform capacity: Provided, That no greater tolerance shall 
be allowed in case of bottles which, because of their design, cannot be 
made of approximately uniform capacity than is allowed in case of 
bottles which can be manufactured so as to be of approximately uniform 
capacity.
    (3) Discrepancies in measure due to differences in atmospheric 
conditions in various places and which unavoidably result from the 
ordinary and customary exposure of alcoholic beverages in bottles to 
evaporation. The reasonableness of discrepancies under this paragraph 
shall be determined on the facts in each case.
    (c) Unreasonable shortages. Unreasonable shortages in certain of the 
bottles in any shipment shall not be compensated by overages in other 
bottles in the same shipment.
    (d) Limitations. This section does not apply after December 31,

``advertisement'' includes any written or verbal statement, 
illlustration, or depiction which is in, or calculated to induce sales 
in, interstate or foreign commerce, or is disseminated by mail, whether 
it appears in a newspaper, magazine, trade booklet, menu, wine card, 
leaflet, circular, mailer, book insert, catalog, promotional material, 
sales pamphlet, or in any written, printed, graphic, or other matter 
accompanying the bottle, representations made on cases or in any 
billboard, sign, other outdoor display, public transit card, other 
periodical literature, publication, or in a radio or television 
broadcast, or in any other media; except that such term shall not 
include:
    (a) Any label affixed to any bottle of distilled spirits; or any 
individual covering, carton, or other container of the bottle which 
constitute a part of the labeling under Sec. Sec. 5.31 through 5.42 of 
this part.
    (b) Any editorial or other reading material (i.e., news release) in

indirectly, by any permittee, and which is not written by or at the 
direction of the permittee.

<R05>
Sec. 5.63  Mandatory statements.

    (a) Responsible advertiser. The advertisement shall state the name 
and address of the permittee responsible for its publication or 
broadcast. Street number and name may be omitted in the address.
    (b) Class and type. The advertisement shall contain a conspicuous 
statement of the class to which the product belongs and the type thereof 
corresponding with the statement of class and type which is required to 
appear on the label of the product.
    (c) Alcohol content--(1) Mandatory statement. The alcohol content 
for distilled spirits shall be stated in percent-alcohol-by-volume. 
Products such as ``Rock and Rye'' or similar products containing a 
significant amount of solid material shall state the alcohol content at 
the time of bottling as follows: ``Bottled at ------ percent-alcohol-by-
volume.''
    (2) Optional statement. In addition, the advertisement may also 
state the alcohol content in degrees of proof if this information 
appears in direct conjunction (i.e. with no intervening material) with 
the statement expressed in percent-alcohol-by-volume. If both forms of 
alcohol content are shown, the optional statement in degrees of proof 
shall be placed in parentheses, in brackets, or otherwise distinguished 
from the mandatory statement in percent-alcohol-by-volume to emphasize 
the fact that both expressions of alcohol content mean the same thing.
    (d) Percentage of neutral spirits and name of commodity. (1) In the 
case of distilled spirits (other than cordials, liqueurs, and 
specialties) produced by blending or rectification, if neutral spirits 
have been used in the production thereof, there shall be stated the 
percentage of neutral spirits so used and the name of the commodity from 
which such neutral spirits have been

[[Page 76]]

distilled. The statement of percentage and the name of the commodity 
shall be made in substantially the following form: ``----% neutral 
spirits distilled from -------- (insert grain, cane products, or fruit, 
as appropriate)''; or ----% neutral spirits (vodka) distilled from ----
---- (insert grain, cane product, or fruit, as appropriate)''; or ``----
% grain (cane products), (fruit) neutral spirits''; or ``----% grain 
spirits''.
    (2) In the case of neutral spirits or of gin produced by a process 
of continuous distillation, there shall be stated the name of the 
commodity from which such neutral spirits or gin has been distilled. The 
statement of the name of the commodity shall be made in substantially 
the following form: ``Distilled from grain'', or ``Distilled from cane 
products'', or ``Distilled from fruit.''
    (e) Exception. (1) If an advertisement refers to a general distilled 
spirits line or all of the distilled spirits products of one company, 
whether by the company name or by the brand name common to all the 
distilled spirits in the line, the only mandatory information necessary 
is the name and address of the responsible advertiser. This exception 
does not apply where only one type of distilled spirits is marketed 
under the specific brand name advertised.
    (2) On consumer specialty items, the only information necessary is 
the company name or brand name of the product.

<R05>
Sec. 5.65  Prohibited practices.

    (a) Restrictions. An advertisement of distilled spirits shall not 
contain:
    (1) Any statement that is false or untrue in any material 
particular, or that, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, 
omission, or inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific or 
technical matter tends to create a misleading impression.
    (2) Any statement that is disparaging of a competitor's product.
    (3) Any statement, design, device, or representation which is 
obscene or indecent.
    (4) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating 
to analyses, standards or tests, irrespective of falsity, which the 
appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer.
    (5) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating 
to any guarantee, irrespective of falsity, which the appropriate TTB 
officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer. Money-back 
guarantees are not prohibited.
    (6) Any statement that the distilled spirits are distilled, blended, 
made, bottled, or sold under or in accordance with any municipal, State, 
Federal, or foreign authorization, law, or regulation, unless such 
statement appears in the manner authorized by Sec. 5.42 for labels of 
distilled spirits. If a municipal, State or Federal permit number is 
stated, such permit number shall not be accompanied by any additional 
statement relating thereto.
    (7) The words ``bond'', ``bonded'', ``bottled in bond'', ``aged in 
bond'', or

[[Page 77]]

phrases containing these or synonymous terms, unless such words or 
phrases appear, pursuant to Sec. 5.42, on labels of the distilled 
spirits advertised, and are stated in the advertisement in the manner 
and form in which they are permitted to appear on the label.
    (8) The word ``pure'' unless:
    (i) It refers to a particular ingredient used in the production of 
the distilled spirits, and is a truthful representation about the 
ingredient; or
    (ii) It is part of the bona fide name of a permittee or retailer 
from whom the distilled spirits are bottled; or
    (iii) It is part of the bona fide name of the permittee who bottled 
the distilled spirits.
    (9) The words ``double distilled'' or ``triple distilled'' or any 
similar terms unless it is a truthful statement of fact; except that 
``double distilled'' or ``triple distilled'' shall not be permitted in 
advertisements of distilled spirits produced by the redistillation 
method when a second or third distillation step is a necessary 
distillation process for the production of the product.
    (b) Statements inconsistent with labeling. (1) Advertisements shall 
not contain any statement concerning a brand or lot of distilled spirits 
that is inconsistent with any statement on the labeling thereof.
    (2) Any label depicted on a bottle in an advertisement shall be a 
reproduction of an approved label.
    (c) Statement of age. The advertisement shall not contain any 
statement, design, or device directly or by implication concerning age 
or maturity of any brand or lot of distilled spirits unless a statement 
of age appears on the label of the advertised product. When any such 
statement, design, or device concerning age or maturity is contained in 
any advertisement, it shall include (in direct conjunction therewith and 
with substantially equal conspicuousness) all parts of the statement, if 
any, concerning age and percentages required to be made on the label 
under the provisions of Sec. Sec. 5.31 through 5.42. An advertisement 
for any whisky or brandy (except immature brandies) which is not 
required to bear a statement of age on the label or an advertisement for 
any rum or Tequila, which has been aged for not less than 4 years may, 
however, contain inconspicuous, general representation as to age, 
maturity or other similar representations even though a specific age 
statement does not appear on the label of the advertised product and in 
the advertisement itself.
    (d) Health-related statements--(1) Definitions. When used in this 
paragraph (d), terms are defined as follows:
    (i) Health-related statement means any statement related to health 
and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature that, 
expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the 
consumption of alcohol, distilled spirits, or any substance found within 
the distilled spirits, and health benefits or effects on health. The 
term includes both specific health claims and general references to 
alleged health benefits or effects on health associated with the 
consumption of alcohol, distilled spirits, or any substance found within 
the distilled spirits, as well as health-related directional statements. 
The term also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical 
or psychological sensation results from consuming the distilled spirits, 
as well as statements and claims of nutritional value (e.g., statements 
of vitamin content). Statements concerning caloric, carbohydrate, 
protein, and fat content do not constitute nutritional claims about the 
product.
    (ii) Specific health claim is a type of health-related statement 
that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the 
distilled spirits, alcohol, or any substance found within the distilled 
spirits, to a disease or health-related condition. Implied specific 
health claims include statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of 
communication that suggest, within the context in which they are 
presented, that a relationship exists between distilled spirits, 
alcohol, or any substance found within the distilled spirits, and a 
disease or health-related condition.
    (iii) Health-related directional statement is a type of health-
related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or 
other source for information regarding the effects on

[[Page 78]]

health of distilled spirits or alcohol consumption.
    (2) Rules for advertising--(i) Health-related statements. In 
general, advertisements may not contain any health-related statement 
that is untrue in any particular or tends to create a misleading 
impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will 
evaluate such statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part 
of the health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying 
statement to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-
related statement. Such disclaimer or other qualifying statement must 
appear as prominent as the health-related statement.
    (ii) Specific health claims. A specific health claim will not be 
considered misleading if it is truthful and adequately substantiated by 
scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed and qualified with 
respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; 
adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and 
heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of 
individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health 
risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim 
and in a manner as prominent as the specific health claim.
    (iii) Health-related directional statements. A statement that 
directs consumers to a third party or other source for information 
regarding the effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol 
consumption is presumed misleading unless it--
    (A) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to 
a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the 
effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol consumption; and
    (B)(1) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, 
and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional 
statement, the following disclaimer: ``This statement should not 
encourage you to drink or increase your alcohol consumption for health 
reasons;'' or
    (2) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, 
and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional 
statement, some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB 
officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed 
by the health-related directional statement.
    (e) Place of origin. The advertisement shall not represent that the 
distilled spirits were manufactured in or imported from a place or 
country other than that of their actual origin, or were produced or 
processed by one who was not in fact the actual producer or processor.
    (f) Confusion of brands. Two or more different brands or lots of 
distilled spirits shall not be advertised in one advertisement (or in 
two or more advertisements in one issue of a periodical or newspaper, or 
in one piece of other written, printed, or graphic matter) if the 
advertisement tends to create the impression that representations made 
as to one brand or lot apply to the other or others, and if as to such 
latter the representations contravene any provisions of this subpart or 
are in any respect untrue.
    (g) Flags, seals, coats of arms, crests, and other insignia. An 
advertisement shall not contain any statement, design, device, or 
pictorial representation which the appropriate TTB officer finds relates 
to, or is capable of being construed as relating to the armed forces of 
the United States, or the American flag, or any emblem, seal, insignia, 
or decoration associated with such flag or armed forces; nor shall any 
advertisement contain any statement, design, device, or pictorial 
representation of or concerning any flag, seal, coat of arms, crest, or 
other insignia, likely to mislead the consumer to believe that the 
product has been endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or under 
the supervision of, or in accordance with the specifications of the 
government, organization, family, or individual with whom such flag, 
seal, coat of arms, crest, or insignia is associated.
    (h) Deceptive advertising techniques. Subliminal or similar 
techniques are prohibited. ``Subliminal or similar techniques,'' as used 
in this part, refers to any device or technique that is used to convey, 
or attempts to convey, a

[[Page 79]]

message to a person by means of images or sounds of a very brief nature 
that cannot be perceived at a normal level of awareness.

Sec. 5.66  Comparative advertising.

    (a) General. Comparative advertising shall not be disparaging of a 
competitor's product.
    (b) Taste tests. (1) Taste test results may be used in 
advertisements comparing competitors' products unless they are 
disparaging, deceptive, or likely to mislead the consumer.
    (2) The taste test procedure used shall meet scientifically accepted 
procedures. An example of a scientifically accepted procedure is 
outlined in the Manual on Sensory Testing Methods, ASTM Special 
Technical Publication 434, published by the American Society for Testing 
and Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, ASTM,

    (c) This section applies to labels and advertising that use the term 
``organic'' on and after October 21, 2002.

product displays to a retailer does not constitute a means to induce 
within the meaning of section 105(b)(3) of the Act provided that the

displays given or sold by an industry member under paragraph (a) of this 
section may not exceed $300 per brand at any one time in any one retail

excess of $300 per brand. The value of a product display is the actual 
cost to the industry member who initially purchased it. Transportation 
and installation costs are excluded.
    (2) All product displays must bear conspicuous and substantial 
advertising matter on the product or the industry member which is 
permanently inscribed or securely affixed. The name and address of the

Sec. 6.151  Exclusion, in general.

    (a) Exclusion, in whole or in part occurs:
    (1) When a practice by an industry member, whether direct, indirect, 
or through an affiliate, places (or has the potential to place) retailer 
independence at risk by means of a tie or link between the industry 
member and retailer or by any other means of industry member control 
over the retailer; and
    (2) Such practice results in the retailer purchasing less than it 
would have of a competitor's product.
    (b) Section 6.152 lists practices that create a tie or link that 
places retailer independence at risk. Section 6.153 lists the criteria 
used for determining whether other practices can put retailer 
independence at risk.


<R05>
Sec. 6.152  Practices which put retailer independence at risk.

    The practices specified in this section put retailer independence at 
risk. The practices specified here are examples and do not constitute a 
complete list of those practices that put retailer independence at risk.
    (a) The act by an industry member of resetting stock on a retailer's 
premises (other than stock offered for sale by the industry member).
    (b) The act by an industry member of purchasing or renting display, 
shelf, storage or warehouse space (i.e. slotting allowance).
    (c) Ownership by an industry member of less than a 100 percent 
interest in a retailer, where such ownership is used to influence the 
purchases of the retailer.

purchase one alcoholic beverage product in order to be allowed to 
purchase another alcoholic beverage product at the same time.


<R05>
Sec. 6.153  Criteria for determining retailer independence.

    The criteria specified in this section are indications that a 
particular practice, other than those in Sec. 6.152, places retailer 
independence at risk. A practice need not meet all of the criteria 
specified in this section in order to place retailer independence at 
risk.
    (a) The practice restricts or hampers the free economic choice of a 
retailer to decide which products to purchase or the quantity in which 
to purchase them for sale to consumers.
    (b) The industry member obligates the retailer to participate in the 
promotion to obtain the industry member's product.

[[Page 90]]

    (c) The retailer has a continuing obligation to purchase or 
otherwise promote the industry member's product.
    (d) The retailer has a commitment not to terminate its relationship 
with the industry member with respect to purchase of the industry 
member's products.
    (e) The practice involves the industry member in the day-to-day 
operations of the retailer. For example, the industry member controls 
the retailer's decisions on which brand of products to purchase, the 
pricing of products, or the manner in which the products will be 
displayed on the retailer's premises.
    (f) The practice is discriminatory in that it is not offered to all 
retailers in the local market on the same terms without business reasons 
present to justify the difference in treatment.

Sec. 7.22a  Voluntary disclosure of major food allergens.

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section the following terms 
have the meanings indicated.
    (1) Major food allergen. Major food allergen means any of the 
following:
    (i) Milk, egg, fish (for example, bass, flounder, or cod), 
Crustacean shellfish (for example, crab, lobster, or shrimp), tree nuts 
(for example, almonds, pecans, or walnuts), wheat, peanuts, and 
soybeans; or
    (ii) A food ingredient that contains protein derived from a food 
specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, except:
    (A) Any highly refined oil derived from a food specified in 
paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section and any ingredient derived from such 
highly refined oil; or
    (B) A food ingredient that is exempt from major food allergen 
labeling requirements pursuant to a petition for exemption approved by 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under 21 U.S.C. 343(w)(6) or 
pursuant to a notice submitted to FDA under 21 U.S.C. 343(w)(7), 
provided that the food ingredient meets the terms or conditions, if any, 
specified for that exemption.
    (2) Name of the food source from which each major food allergen is 
derived. Name of the food source from which each major food allergen is 
derived means the name of the food as listed in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of 
this section, except that:
    (i) In the case of a tree nut, it means the name of the specific 
type of nut (for example, almonds, pecans, or walnuts); and
    (ii) In the case of Crustacean shellfish, it means the name of the 
species of Crustacean shellfish (for example, crab, lobster, or shrimp); 
and
    (iii) The names ``egg'' and ``peanuts'', as well as the names of the 
different types of tree nuts, may be expressed in either the singular or 
plural form, and the name ``soy'', ``soybean'', or ``soya'' may be used 
instead of ``soybeans''.
    (b) Voluntary labeling standards. Major food allergens (defined in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section) used in the production of a malt 
beverage product may, on a voluntary basis, be declared on any label 
affixed to the container. However, if any one major food allergen is 
voluntarily declared, all major food allergens used in production of the 
malt beverage product, including major food allergens used as fining or 
processing agents, must be declared, except when covered by a petition 
for exemption approved by the appropriate TTB officer under Sec. 7.22b. 
The major food allergens declaration must consist of the word 
``Contains'' followed by a colon and the name of the food source from 
which each major food allergen is derived (for example, ``Contains: 
egg'').
    (c) Cross reference. For mandatory labeling requirements applicable 
to malt beverage products containing FD&C Yellow No. 5, sulfites, and 
aspartame, see Sec. Sec. 7.22(b)(4), (b)(6), and (b)(7).

<R05>
Sec. 7.22b  Petitions for exemption from major food allergen labeling.

    (a) Submission of petition. Any person may petition the appropriate 
TTB officer to exempt a particular product or class of products from the 
labeling requirements of Sec. 7.22a. The burden is on the petitioner to 
provide scientific evidence (including the analytical method used to 
produce the evidence) that demonstrates that the finished product or 
class of products, as derived by the method specified in the petition, 
either:
    (1) Does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human 
health; or
    (2) Does not contain allergenic protein derived from one of the 
foods identified in Sec. 7.22(a)(1)(i), even though a major food 
allergen was used in production.
    (b) Decision on petition. TTB will approve or deny a petition for 
exemption submitted under paragraph (a) of this section in writing 
within 180 days of receipt of the petition. If TTB does not provide a 
written response to the petitioner within that 180-day period, the 
petition will be deemed denied, unless an extension of time for decision 
is mutually agreed upon by the appropriate TTB officer and the 
petitioner. TTB may confer with the Food and Drug

[[Page 95]]

Administration (FDA) on petitions for exemption, as appropriate and as 
FDA resources permit. TTB may require the submission of product samples 
and other additional information in support of a petition; however, 
unless required by TTB, the submission of samples or additional 
information by the petitioner after submission of the petition will be 
treated as the withdrawal of the initial petition and the submission of 
a new petition. An approval or denial under this section will constitute 
a final agency action.
    (c) Resubmission of a petition. After a petition for exemption is 
denied under this section, the petitioner may resubmit the petition 
along with supporting materials for reconsideration at any time. TTB 
will treat this submission as a new petition.
    (d) Availability of information--(1) General. TTB will promptly post 
to its public Web site, http://www.ttb.gov, all petitions received under 
this section as well as TTB's responses to those petitions. Any 
information submitted in support of the petition that is not posted to 
the TTB Web site will be available to the public pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552, except where a request for confidential treatment is granted under 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (2) Requests for confidential treatment of business information. A 
person who provides trade secrets or other commercial or financial 
information in connection with a petition for exemption under this 
section may request that TTB give confidential treatment to that 
information. A failure to request confidential treatment at the time the 
information in question is submitted to TTB will constitute a waiver of 
confidential treatment. A request for confidential treatment of 
information under this section must conform to the following standards:
    (i) The request must be in writing;
    (ii) The request must clearly identify the information to be kept 
confidential;
    (iii) The request must relate to information that constitutes trade 
secrets or other confidential commercial or financial information 
regarding the business transactions of an interested person, the 
disclosure of which would cause substantial harm to the competitive 
position of that person;
    (iv) The request must set forth the reasons why the information 
should not be disclosed, including the reasons the disclosure of the 
information would prejudice the competitive position of the interested 
person; and
    (v) The request must be supported by a signed statement by the 
interested person, or by an authorized officer or employee of that 
person, certifying that the information in question is a trade secret or 
other confidential commercial or financial information and that the 
information is not already in the public domain.

Sec. 7.23  Brand names.

    (a) General. The product shall bear a brand name, except that if not 
sold under a brand name, then the name of the person required to appear 
on the brand label shall be deemed a brand name for the purpose of this 
part.
    (b) Misleading brand names. No label shall contain any brand name, 
which, standing alone, or in association with other printed or graphic 
matter, creates any impression or inference as to the age, origin, 
identity, or other characteristics of the product unless the appropriate 
TTB officer finds that such brand name, either when qualified by the 
word ``brand'' or when not so qualified, conveys no erroneous 
impressions as to the age, origin, identity, or other characteristics of 
the product.
    (c) Trade name of foreign origin. This section shall not operate to 
prohibit the use by any person of any trade name or brand of foreign 
origin not effectively registered in the United States Patent Office on 
August 29, 1935, which has been used by such person or his predecessors 
in the United States for a period of at least 5 years immediately 
preceding August 29, 1935: Provided, That if such trade name or brand is 
used, the designation of the product shall be qualified by the name of 
the locality in the United States in which produced, and such 
qualification shall be in script, type, or printing as conspicuous as 
the trade name or brand.

[[Page 96]]


<R05>
Sec. 7.24  Class and type.

    (a) The class of the malt beverage shall be stated and, if desired, 
the type thereof may be stated. Statements of class and type shall 
conform to the designation of the product as known to the trade. If the 
product is not known to the trade under a particular designation, a 
distinctive or fanciful name, together with an adequate and truthful 
statement of the composition of the product, shall be stated, and such 
statement shall be deemed to be a statement of class and type for the 
purposes of this part.
    (b) Malt beverages which have been concentrated by the removal of 
water therefrom and reconstituted by the addition of water and carbon 
dioxide shall for the purpose of this part be labeled in the same manner 
as malt beverages which have not been concentrated and reconstituted, 
except that there shall appear in direct conjunction with, and as a part 
of, the class designation the statement ``PRODUCED FROM -------- 
CONCENTRATE'' (the blank to be filled in with the appropriate class 
designation). All parts of the class designation shall appear in 
lettering of substantially the same size and kind.
    (c) No product shall be designated as ``half and half'' unless it is 
in fact composed of equal parts of two classes of malt beverages the 
names of which are conspicuously stated in conjunction with the 
designation ``half and half''.
    (d) Products containing less than one-half of 1 percent (.5%) of 
alcohol by volume shall bear the class designation ``malt beverage,'' or 
``cereal beverage,'' or ``near beer.'' If the designation ``near beer'' 
is used, both words must appear in the same size and style of type, in 
the same color of ink, and on the same background. No product containing 
less than one-half of 1 percent of alcohol by volume shall bear the 
class designations ``beer'', ``lager beer'', ``lager'', ``ale'', 
``porter'', or ``stout'', or any other class or type designation 
commonly applied to malt beverages containing one-half of 1 percent or 
more of alcohol by volume.
    (e) No product other than a malt beverage fermented at comparatively 
high temperature, possessing the characteristics generally attributed to 
``ale,'' ``porter,'' or ``stout'' and produced without the use of 
coloring or flavoring materials (other than those recognized in standard 
brewing practices) shall bear any of these class designations.
    (f) Geographical names for distinctive types of malt beverages 
(other than names found under paragraph (g) of this section to have 
become generic) shall not be applied to malt beverages produced in any 
place other than the particular region indicated by the name unless (1) 
in direct conjunction with the name there appears the word ``type'' or 
the word ``American'', or some other statement indicating the true place 
of production in lettering substantially as conspicuous as such name, 
and (2) the malt beverages to which the name is applied conform to the 
type so designated. The following are examples of distinctive types of 
beer with geographical names that have not become generic; Dortmund, 
Dortmunder, Vienna, Wein, Weiner, Bavarian, Munich, Munchner, Salvator, 
Kulmbacher, Wurtzburger, Pilsen (Pilsener and Pilsner): Provided, That 
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, beer which is 
produced in the United States may be designated as ``Pilsen,'' 
``Pilsener,'' or ``Pilsner'' without further modification, if it 
conforms to such type.
    (g) Only such geographical names for distinctive types of malt 
beverages as the appropriate TTB officer finds have by usage and common 
knowledge lost their geographical significance to such an extent that 
they have become generic shall be deemed to have become generic, e.g., 
India Pale Ale.
    (h) Except as provided in Sec. 7.23(b), geographical names that are 
not names for distinctive types of malt beverages shall not be applied 
to malt beverages produced in any place other than the particular place 
or region indicated in the name.

    (a) Domestic malt beverages. (1) On labels of containers of domestic 
malt beverages there shall be stated the

[[Page 97]]

name of the bottler or packer and the place where bottled or packed. The 
bottler's or packer's principal place of business may be shown in lieu 
of the actual place where bottled or packed if the address shown is a 
location where bottling or packing operation takes place. The 
appropriate TTB officer may disapprove the listing of a principal place 
of business if its use would create a false or misleading impression as 
to the geographic origin of the beer.
    (2) If malt beverages are bottled or packed for a person other than 
the actual bottler or packer there may be stated in addition to the name 
and address of the bottler or packer (but not in lieu of), the name and 
address of such other person immediately preceded by the words ``bottled 
for,'' ``distributed by,'' or other similar appropriate phrase.
    (b) Imported malt beverages. On labels of containers of imported 
malt beverages, there shall be stated the words ``imported by,'' or a 
singular appropriate phrase, and immediately thereafter the name of the 
permittee who is the importer, or exclusive agent, or sole distributor, 
or other person responsible for the importation, together with the 
principal place of business in the United States of such person. In 
addition there may, but need not, be stated unless required by State or 
foreign law or regulation the name and principal place of business of 
the foreign manufacturer, bottler, packer, or shipper.
    (c) Post-office address. The ``place'' stated shall be the post-
office address, except that the street address may be omitted. No 
additional places or addresses shall be stated for the same person, 
unless (1) such person is actively engaged in the conduct of an 
additional bona fide and actual malt beverage business at such 
additional place or address, and (2) the label also contains, in direct 
conjunction therewith, appropriate descriptive material indicating the 
function occurring at such additional place or address in connection 
with the particular malt beverage.

    (a) The alcoholic content and the percentage and quantity of the 
original extract shall not be stated unless required by State law. When 
alcoholic content is required to be stated, but the manner of statement 
is not specified in the State law, it shall be stated in percentage of 
alcohol by weight or by volume, and not by proof or by maximums or 
minimums. Otherwise the manner of statement shall be as specified in the 
State law.
    (b) The terms ``low alcohol'' or ``reduced alcohol'' may be used 
only on malt beverage products containing less than 2.5 percent alcohol 
by volume.
    (c) The term ``non-alcoholic'' may be used on malt beverage 
products, provided the statement ``contains less than 0.5 percent (or 
.5%) alcohol by volume'' appears in direct conjunction with it, in 
readily legible printing and on a completely contrasting background.
    (d) The term ``alcohol-free'' may be used only on malt beverage 
products containing no alcohol.

information, the script, type, or printing of all mandatory information 
shall be of a size substantially more conspicuous than that of the 
descriptive or explanatory information.
    (2) Containers of one-half pint or less. Except for statements of

Sec. 7.29  Prohibited practices.

    (a) Statements on labels. Containers of malt beverages, or any 
labels on such containers, or any carton, case, or individual covering 
of such containers, used for sale at retail, or any written, printed, 
graphic, or other material accompanying such containers to the consumer, 
must not contain:
    (1) Any statement that is false or untrue in any particular, or 
that, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, omission, or 
inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific or technical 
matter, tends to create a misleading impression.
    (2) Any statement that is disparaging of a competitor's products.
    (3) Any statement, design, device, or representation which is 
obscene or indecent.
    (4) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating 
to analyses, standards, or tests, irrespective of falsity, which the 
appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer.
    (5) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating 
to any guarantee, irrespective of falsity,

[[Page 99]]

which the appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the 
consumer. Money-back guarantees are not prohibited.
    (6) A trade or brand name that is the name of any living individual 
of public prominence, or existing private or public organization, or is 
a name that is in simulation or is an abbreviation thereof, or any 
graphic, pictorial, or emblematic representation of any such individual 
or organization, if the use of such name or representation is likely 
falsely to lead the consumer to believe that the product has been 
endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision 
of, or in accordance with the specifications of, such individual or 
organization: Provided, That this paragraph shall not apply to the use 
of the name of any person engaged in business as a producer, importer, 
bottler, packer, wholesaler, retailer, or warehouseman, of malt 
beverages, nor to the use by any person of a trade or brand name that is 
the name of any living individual of public prominence, or existing 
private or public organization, provided such trade or brand name was 
used by him or his predecessors in interest prior to August 29, 1935.
    (7) Any statement, design, device, or representation that tends to 
create a false or misleading impression that the malt beverage contains 
distilled spirits or is a distilled spirits product. This paragraph does 
not prohibit the following on malt beverage labels:
    (i) A truthful and accurate statement of alcohol content, in 
conformity with Sec. 7.71;
    (ii) The use of a brand name of a distilled spirits product as a 
malt beverage brand name, provided that the overall label does not 
present a misleading impression about the identity of the product; or
    (iii) The use of a cocktail name as a brand name or fanciful name of 
a malt beverage, provided that the overall label does not present a 
misleading impression about the identity of the product.
    (b) Simulation of Government stamps. No label shall be of such 
design as to resemble or simulate a stamp of the United States 
Government or of any State or foreign government. No label, other than 
stamps authorized or required by the United States Government or any 
State or foreign government, shall state or indicate that the malt 
beverage contained in the labeled container is brewed, made, bottled, 
packed, labeled, or sold under, or in accordance with, any municipal, 
State, Federal, or foreign government authorization, law, or regulation, 
unless such statement is required or specifically authorized by Federal, 
State, or municipal, law or regulation, or is required or specifically 
authorized by the laws or regulations of the foreign country in which 
such malt beverages were produced. If the municipal or State government 
permit number is stated upon a label, it shall not be accompanied by an 
additional statement relating thereto, unless required by State law.
    (c) Use of word ``bonded'', etc. The words ``bonded'', ``bottled in 
bond'', ``aged in bond'', ``bonded age'', ``bottled under customs 
supervision'', or phrases containing these or synonymous terms which 
imply governmental supervision over production, bottling, or packing, 
shall not be used on any label for malt beverages.
    (d) Flags, seals, coats of arms, crests, and other insignia. Labels 
shall not contain, in the brand name or otherwise, any statement, 
design, device, or pictorial representation which the appropriate TTB 
officer finds relates to, or is capable of being construed as relating 
to, the armed forces of the United States, or the American flag, or any 
emblem, seal, insignia, or decoration associated with such flag or armed 
forces; nor shall any label contain any statement, design, device, or 
pictorial representation of or concerning any flag, seal, coat of arms, 
crest or other insignia, likely to mislead the consumer to believe that 
the product has been endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or 
under the supervision of, or in accordance with the specifications of 
the government, organization, family, or individual with whom such flag, 
seal, coat of arms, crest, or insignia is associated.
    (e) Health-related statements--(1) Definitions. When used in this 
paragraph (e), terms are defined as follows:
    (i) Health-related statement means any statement related to health 
(other

[[Page 100]]

than the warning statement required by Sec. 16.21 of this chapter) and 
includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature that, expressly 
or by implication, suggest a relationship between the consumption of 
alcohol, malt beverages, or any substance found within the malt 
beverage, and health benefits or effects on health. The term includes 
both specific health claims and general references to alleged health 
benefits or effects on health associated with the consumption of 
alcohol, malt beverages, or any substance found within the malt 
beverage, as well as health-related directional statements. The term 
also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical or 
psychological sensation results from consuming the malt beverage, as 
well as statements and claims of nutritional value (e.g., statements of 
vitamin content). Statements concerning caloric, carbohydrate, protein, 
and fat content do not constitute nutritional claims about the product.
    (ii) Specific health claim is a type of health-related statement 
that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the 
malt beverage, alcohol, or any substance found within the malt beverage, 
to a disease or health-related condition. Implied specific health claims 
include statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication 
that suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a 
relationship exists between malt beverages, alcohol, or any substance 
found within the malt beverage, and a disease or health-related 
condition.
    (iii) Health-related directional statement is a type of health-
related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or 
other source for information regarding the effects on health of malt 
beverage or alcohol consumption.
    (2) Rules for labeling--(i) Health-related statements. In general, 
labels may not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in 
any particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the 
effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will evaluate such 
statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part of the 
health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying statement 
to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related 
statement.
    (ii) Specific health claims. (A) TTB will consult with the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), as needed, on the use of a specific health 
claim on a malt beverage label. If FDA determines that the use of such a 
labeling claim is a drug claim that is not in compliance with the 
requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, TTB will not 
approve the use of that specific health claim on a malt beverage label.
    (B) TTB will approve the use of a specific health claim on a malt 
beverage label only if the claim is truthful and adequately 
substantiated by scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed 
and qualified with respect to the categories of individuals to whom the 
claim applies; adequately discloses the health risks associated with 
both moderate and heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines 
the categories of individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption 
may cause health risks. This information must appear as part of the 
specific health claim.
    (iii) Health-related directional statements. A statement that 
directs consumers to a third party or other source for information 
regarding the effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption 
is presumed misleading unless it--
    (A) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to 
a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the 
effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption; and
    (B)(1) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement 
the following disclaimer: ``This statement should not encourage you to 
drink or to increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons;'' or
    (2) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement 
some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds 
is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the 
health-related directional statement.
    (f) Use of words ``strong,'' ``full strength,'' and similar words. 
Labels shall not contain the words ``strong,'' ``full strength,'' 
``extra strength,''

[[Page 101]]

``high test,'' ``high proof,'' ``pre-war strength,'' ``full oldtime 
alcoholic strength,'' or similar words or statements, likely to be 
considered as statements of alcoholic content, unless required by State 
law. This does not preclude use of the terms ``low alcohol,'' ``reduced 
alcohol,'' ``non-alcoholic,'' and ``alcohol-free,'' in accordance with 
Sec. 7.71 (d), (e), and (f), nor does it preclude labeling with the 
alcohol content in accordance with Sec. 7.71.
    (g) Use of numerals. Labels shall not contain any statements, 
designs, or devices, whether in the form of numerals, letters, 
characters, figures, or otherwise, which are likely to be considered as 
statements of alcoholic content, unless required by State law, or as 
permitted by Sec. 7.71.
    (h) Coverings, cartons, or cases. Individual coverings, cartons, 
cases, or other wrappers of containers of malt beverages, used for sale 
at retail, or any written, printed, graphic, or other matter 
accompanying the container shall not contain any statement or any 
graphic pictorial, or emblematic representation, or other matter, which 
is prohibited from appearing on any label or container of malt 
beverages.

Sec. 7.54  Prohibited statements.

    (a) General prohibition. An advertisement of malt beverages must not 
contain:
    (1) Any statement that is false or untrue in any material 
particular, or that, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, 
omission, or inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific or 
technical matter, tends to create a misleading impression.

    (3) Any statement, design, device, or representation which is 
obscene or indecent.
    (4) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating 
to analyses, standards, or tests, irrespective of falsity, which the 
appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer.
    (5) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating 
to any guarantee, irrespective of falsity, which the appropriate TTB 
officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer. Money-back 
guarantees are not prohibited.

packed, labeled, or sold under, or in accordance with, any municipal, 
State, or Federal authorization, law, or regulation; and if a municipal

``bonded age'', ``bottled under customs supervision'', or phrases 
containing these or synonymous terms which imply governmental 
supervision over production, bottling, or packing.
    (8) Any statement, design, device, or representation that tends to 
create a false or misleading impression that the malt beverage contains 
distilled spirits or is a distilled spirits product. This

[[Page 104]]

paragraph does not prohibit the following in advertisements for malt 
beverages:
    (i) A truthful and accurate statement of alcohol content, in 
conformity with Sec. 7.71;
    (ii) The use of a brand name of a distilled spirits product as a 
malt beverage brand name, provided that the overall advertisement does 
not present a misleading impression about the identity of the product; 
or
    (iii) The use of a cocktail name as a brand name or fanciful name of 
a malt beverage, provided that the overall advertisement does not

alcoholic content, or any statement of the percentage and quantity of 
the original extract, or any numerals, letters, characters, figures, or 
similar words or statements, likely to be considered as statements of 
alcoholic content, unless required by State law. This does not preclude 
use of the terms ``low alcohol,'' ``reduced alcohol,'' ``non-
alcoholic,'' and ``alcohol-free,'' as used on labels, in accordance with 
Sec. 7.71 (d), (e), and (f).
    (2) An approved malt beverage label which bears a statement of

high temperature, possessing the characteristics generally attributed to 
``ale,'' ``porter,'' or ``stout'' and produced without the use of 
coloring or flavoring materials (other than those recognized in standard 
brewing practices) shall be designated in any advertisement by any of 
these class designations.
    (e) Health-related statements--(1) Definitions. When used in this 
paragraph (e), terms are defined as follows:
    (i) Health-related statement means any statement related to health 
and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature that, 
expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the 
consumption of alcohol, malt beverages, or any substance found within 
the malt beverage, and health benefits or effects on health. The term 
includes both specific health claims and general references to alleged 
health benefits or effects on health associated with the consumption of 
alcohol, malt beverages, or any substance found within the malt 
beverage, as well as health-related directional statements. The term 
also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical or 
psychological sensation results from consuming the malt beverage, as 
well as statements and claims of nutritional value (e.g., statements of 
vitamin content). Statements concerning caloric, carbohydrate, protein, 
and fat content do not constitute nutritional claims about the product.
    (ii) Specific health claim is a type of health-related statement 
that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the 
malt beverage, alcohol, or any substance found within the malt beverage, 
to a disease or health-related condition. Implied specific health claims

that suggest, within

[[Page 105]]

the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists 
between malt beverages, alcohol, or any substance found within the malt 
beverage, and a disease or health-related condition.
    (iii) Health-related directional statement is a type of health-
related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or 
other source for information regarding the effects on health of malt 
beverage or alcohol consumption.
    (2) Rules for advertising--(i) Health-related statements. In 
general, advertisements may not contain any health-related statement 
that is untrue in any particular or tends to create a misleading 
impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will 
evaluate such statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part 
of the health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying 
statement to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-
related statement. Such disclaimer or other qualifying statement must 
appear as prominent as the health-related statement.
    (ii) Specific health claims. A specific health claim will not be 
considered misleading if it is truthful and adequately substantiated by 
scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed and qualified with 
respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; 
adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and 
heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of 
individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health 
risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim 
and in a manner as prominent as the specific health claim.
    (iii) Health-related directional statements. A statement that 
directs consumers to a third party or other source for information 
regarding the effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption 
is presumed misleading unless it--
    (A) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to 
a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the 
effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption; and
    (B)(1) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, 
and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional 
statement, the following disclaimer: ``This statement should not 
encourage you to drink or increase your alcohol consumption for health 
reasons;'' or
    (2) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, 
and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional 
statement, some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB 
officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed 
by the health-related directional statement.
    (f) Confusion of brands. Two or more different brands or lots of 
malt beverages shall not be advertised in one advertisement (or in two 
or more advertisements in one issue of a periodical or a newspaper or in 
one piece of other written, printed, or graphic matter) if the 
advertisement tends to create the impression that representations made 
as to one brand or lot apply to the other or others, and if as to such 
latter the representations contravene any provision of Sec. Sec. 7.50 
through 7.54 or are in any respect untrue.
    (g) Flags, seals, coats of arms, crests, and other insignia. No 
advertisement shall contain any statement, design, device, or pictorial 
representation of or relating to, or capable of being construed as 
relating to the armed forces of the United States, or of the American 
flag, or of any emblem, seal, insignia, or decoration associated with 
such flag or armed forces; nor shall any advertisement contain any 
statement, device, design, or pictorial representation of or concerning 
any flag, seal, coat of arms, crest, or other insignia, likely to 
mislead the consumer to believe that the product has been endorsed, 
made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision of, or in 
accordance with the specifications of the government, organization, 
family, or individual with whom such flag, seal, coat of arms, crest, or 
insignia is associated.
    (h) Deceptive advertising techniques. Subliminal or similar 
techniques are prohibited. ``Subliminal or similar techniques,'' as used 
in this part, refers

[[Page 106]]

to any device or technique that is used to convey, or attempts to 
convey, a message to a person by means of images or sounds of a very 
brief nature that cannot be perceived at a normal level of awareness.

percent alcohol by volume,'' or ``--percent alcohol/volume.'' The 
abbreviations ``alc'' and ``vol'' may be used in lieu of the words 
``alcohol'' and ``volume,'' and the symbol ``%'' may be used in lieu of 
the word ``percent.''
    (c) Tolerances. (1) For malt beverages containing 0.5 percent or 
more alcohol by volume, a tolerance of 0.3 percent will be permitted, 
either above or below the stated percentage of alcohol. Any malt 
beverage which is labeled as containing 0.5 percent or more alcohol by 
volume may not contain less than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume, 
regardless of any tolerance.
    (2) For malt beverages which are labeled as ``low alcohol'' or 
``reduced alcohol'' under paragraph (d) of this section, the actual 
alcoholic content may not equal or exceed 2.5 percent alcohol by volume, 
regardless of any tolerance permitted by paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section.
    (3) For malt beverages containing less than 0.5 percent alcohol by 
volume, the actual alcoholic content may not exceed the labeled 
alcoholic content. A malt beverage may not be labeled with an alcoholic 
content of 0.0 percent alcohol by volume unless it is also labeled as 
``alcohol free'' and contains no alcohol.
    (d) Low alcohol and reduced alcohol. The terms ``low alcohol'' or 
``reduced alcohol'' may be used only on malt beverages containing less 
than 2.5 percent alcohol by volume.

[[Page 107]]

    (e) Non-alcoholic. The term ``non-alcoholic'' may be used on malt 
beverages, provided the statement ``contains less than 0.5 percent (or 
.5%) alcohol by volume'' appears in direct conjunction with it, in 
readily legible printing and on a completely contrasting background.
    (f) Alcohol free. The term ``alcohol free'' may be used only on malt 
beverages containing no alcohol.

                  Subpart I_Use of the Term ``Organic''


<R05>
Sec. 7.81  Use of the term ``organic.''

    (a) Use of the term ``organic'' is optional and is treated as 
``additional information on labels'' under Sec. 7.28(e).
    (b) Any use of the term ``organic'' on a malt beverage label or in 
advertising of malt beverages must comply with the United States 
Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Organic Program rules (7 CFR 
part 205) as interpreted by the USDA.
    (c) This section applies to labels and advertising that use the term 
``organic'' on and after October 21, 2002.

commerce; and

[[Page 108]]

    (2) If: (i) The requirement is made in the course of interstate or 
foreign commerce; or
    (ii) The industry member engages in the practice of using a 
requirement to such an extent as substantially to restrain or prevent 
transactions in interstate or foreign commerce in any such products; or
    (iii) The direct effect of the requirement is to prevent, deter, 
hinder, or restrict other persons from selling or offering for sale any 
such products to such retailer in interstate or foreign commerce.
    (b) Malt beverages. In the case of malt beverages, this part applies 
to transactions between a retailer in any State and a brewer, importer,

extent that the law of such State imposes requirements similar to the 
requirements of section 5(a) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act

<R04>
                     Subpart C_Prohibited Practices


<R05>
Sec. 8.21  General.

    It is unlawful for an industry member to require, by agreement or 
otherwise, that any retailer purchase distilled spirits, wine, or malt 
beverages from the industry member to the exclusion, in whole or in 
part, of products sold or offered for sale by other persons in 
interstate or foreign commerce. This prohibition includes purchases 
coerced by industry members, through acts or threats of physical or 
economic harm, as well as voluntary industry member-retailer purchase 
agreements.


<R05>
Sec. 8.22  Contracts to purchase distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages.

    Any contract or agreement, written or unwritten, which has the 
effect of requiring the retailer to purchase distilled spirits, wine, or 
malt beverages from the industry member beyond a single sales 
transaction is prohibited. Examples of such contracts are:
    (a) An advertising contract between an industry member and a 
retailer with the express or implied requirement of the purchase of the 
advertiser's products; or
    (b) A sales contract awarded on a competitive bid basis which has 
the effect of prohibiting the retailer from purchasing from other 
industry members by:
    (1) Requiring that for the period of the agreement, the retailer 
purchase a product or line of products exclusively from the industry 
member; or
    (2) Requiring that the retailer purchase a specific or minimum 
quantity during the period of the agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 8.23  Third party arrangements.

    Industry member requirements, by agreement or otherwise, with non-
retailers which result in a retailer being required to purchase the 
industry member's products are within the exclusive outlet provisions. 
These industry member requirements are covered whether the agreement or 
other arrangement originates with the industry member or the third 
party. For example, a supplier enters into a contractual agreement or 
other arrangement with a third party. This agreement or arrangement 
contains an industry member requirement as described above. The third 
party, a ballclub, or municipal or private corporation, not acting as a 
retailer, leases the concession rights and is able to control the 
purchasing decisions of the retailer. The third party, as a result of 
the requirement, by agreement or otherwise, with the industry member, 
requires the retailer to purchase the industry member's products to the 
exclusion, in

[[Page 110]]

whole or in part, of products sold or offered for sale by other persons 
in interstate or foreign commerce. The business arrangements entered 
into by the industry member and the third party may consist of such 
things as sponsoring radio or television broadcasting, paying for 
advertising, or providing other services or things of value.

    Source: T.D. ATF-364, 60 FR 20425, Apr. 26, 1995, unless otherwise 
noted.


<R05>
Sec. 8.51  Exclusion, in general.

    (a) Exclusion, in whole or in part occurs:
    (1) When a practice by an industry member, whether direct, indirect, 
or through an affiliate, places (or has the potential to place) retailer 
independence at risk by means of a tie or link between the industry 
member and retailer or by any other means of industry member control 
over the retailer, and
    (2) Such practice results in the retailer purchasing less than it 
would have of a competitor's product.
    (b) Section 8.52 lists practices that result in exclusion. Section 
8.53 lists practices not resulting in exclusion. Section 8.54 lists the 
criteria used for determining whether other practices can put retailer 
independence at risk.


<R05>
Sec. 8.52  Practices which result in exclusion.

    The practices specified in this section result in exclusion under 
section 105(a) of the Act. The practices specified here are examples and 
do not constitute a complete list of such practices:
    (a) Purchases of distilled spirits, wine or malt beverages by a 
retailer as a result, directly or indirectly, of a threat or act of 
physical or economic harm by the selling industry member.
    (b) Contracts between an industry member and a retailer which 
require the retailer to purchase distilled spirits, wine, or malt 
beverages from that industry member and expressly restrict the retailer 
from purchasing, in whole or in part, such products from another 
industry member.


<R05>
Sec. 8.53  Practice not resulting in exclusion.

    The practice specified in this section is deemed not to result in 
exclusion under section 105(a) of the Act: a supply contract for one 
year or less between the industry member and retailer under which the 
industry member agrees to sell distilled spirits, wine, or malt 
beverages to the retailer on an ``as needed'' basis provided that the 
retailer is not required to purchase any minimum quantity of such 
product.


<R05>
Sec. 8.54  Criteria for determining retailer independence.

    The criteria specified in this section are indications that a 
particular practice, other than those in Sec. Sec. 8.52 and 8.53, 
places retailer independence at risk. A practice need not meet all of 
the criteria specified in this section in order to place retailer 
independence at risk.
    (a) The practice restricts or hampers the free economic choice of a 
retailer to decide which products to purchase or the quantity in which 
to purchase them for sale to consumers.
    (b) The industry member obligates the retailer to participate in the 
promotion to obtain the industry member's product.
    (c) The retailer has a continuing obligation to purchase or 
otherwise promote the industry member's product.
    (d) The retailer has a commitment not to terminate its relationship 
with the industry member with respect to purchase of the industry 
member's products.
    (e) The practice involves the industry member in the day-to-day 
operations of the retailer. For example, the industry member controls 
the retailer's decisions on which brand of products to purchase, the 
pricing of products, or the manner in which the products will be 
displayed on the retailer's premises.
    (f) The practice is discriminatory in that it is not offered to all 
retailers in the local market on the same terms without business reasons 
present to justify the difference in treatment.

Federal Alcohol Administration Act and used in this part shall have the 
meaning assigned to it by that Act.
    Act. The Federal Alcohol Administration Act.

<R04>
                      Subpart C_Commercial Bribery


<R05>
Sec. 10.21  Commercial bribery.

    It is unlawful for an industry member, directly or indirectly or 
through an affiliate, to induce a trade buyer to purchase the industry 
member's products, to the complete or partial exclusion of products sold 
or offered for sale by other persons in interstate or foreign commerce, 
by offering or giving a bonus, premium, compensation, or other thing of 
value to any officer, employee, or representative of the trade buyer. 
The bonus, premium, compensation, or other thing of value need not be 
offered or given for the purpose of directly inducing a trade buyer to 
purchase from the seller, but rather is applicable if an industry member 
induces officers, employees or representatives of the trade buyer to 
promote sales of the industry member's products and thereby indirectly 
induces the trade buyer to purchase from the industry member.


<R05>
Sec. 10.22  Employee associations.

    Gifts, donations, and other payments such as for advertising in 
publications, by an industry member, to trade buyer employee 
associations are considered the same as bonuses, premiums, compensation, 
or other things of value given directly to the employees, since the 
benefits resulting from the gifts or payments flow to the individual 
members of the association.


<R05>
Sec. 10.23  Gifts or payments to wholesalers.

    Although industry members are not prohibited from offering or giving 
money or other things of value to a wholesale entity (i.e., the 
corporation, partnership, or individual who owns the business), the 
wholesaler will be considered as acting as a mere conduit between its 
officers, employees, or representatives and the industry member, if:

[[Page 303]]

    (a) There is an agreement or understanding, implied or explicit, 
that the money or thing of value will be passed on to the officers, 
employees, or representatives, or
    (b) It is obvious by the very nature of the item given (such as a 
free trip) that a pass through to the officers, employees, or 
representatives is clearly contemplated, or
    (c) The records of the recipient wholesaler do not accurately 
reflect such money or item as an asset or the wholesale entity, thus 
being subject to all ensuing tax consequences as distinguished from the 
receipt of the money or item as a personal asset of an officer, 
employee, or representative.


<R05>
Sec. 10.24  Sales promotion contests.

    Sales contests sponsored by an industry member which offer prizes 
directly or indirectly to trade buyer officers, employees or 
representatives are inducements within the meaning of the Act.

                           Subpart D_Exclusion

    Source: T.D. ATF-364, 60 FR 20427, Apr. 26, 1995, unless otherwise 
noted.


<R05>
Sec. 10.51  Exclusion, in general.

    (a) Exclusion, in whole or in part occurs:
    (1) When a practice by an industry member, whether direct, indirect, 
or through an affiliate, places (or has the potential to place) trade 
buyer independence at risk by means of a tie or link between the 
industry member and trade buyer or by any other means of industry member 
control over the trade buyer, and
    (2) Such practice results in the trade buyer purchasing less than it 
would have of a competitor's product.
    (b) Section 10.52 lists practices that create a tie or link that 
places trade buyer independence at risk. Section 10.53 is reserved and 
will list practices not resulting in exclusion. Section 10.54 lists the 
criteria used for determining whether other practices can put trade 
buyer independence at risk.


<R05>
Sec. 10.52  Practice which puts trade buyer independence at risk.

    The practice specified in this section is deemed to place trade 
buyer independence at risk within the description of exclusion in Sec. 
10.51: Industry member payments of money to the employee(s) of a trade 
buyer without the knowledge or consent of the trade buyer-employer in 
return for the employee agreeing to order distilled spirits, wine, or 
malt beverages from the industry member. The practice enumerated here is 
an example and does not constitute a complete list of those situations 
which result in such control.


<R05>
Sec. 10.53  Practices not resulting in exclusion. [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 10.54  Criteria for determining trade buyer independence.

    The criteria specified in this section are indications that a 
particular practice between an industry member and an officer, employee, 
or representative of a trade buyer, other than those in Sec. 10.52, 
places trade buyer independence at risk. A practice need not meet all of 
the criteria specified in this section in order to place trade buyer 
independence at risk.
    (a) The practice restricts or hampers the free economic choice of a 
trade buyer to decide which products to purchase or the quantity in 
which to purchase them for sale to retailers and consumers.
    (b) The industry member obligates the trade buyer to participate in 
the promotion to obtain the industry member's product.
    (c) The trade buyer has a continuing obligation to purchase or 
otherwise promote the industry member's product.
    (d) The trade buyer has a commitment not to terminate its 
relationship with the industry member with respect to purchase of the 
industry member's products.
    (e) The practice involves the industry member in the day-to-day 
operations of

[[Page 304]]

the trade buyer. For example, the industry member controls the trade 
buyer's decisions on which brand of products to purchase, the pricing of 
products, or the manner in which the products will be displayed on the 
trade buyer's premises.
    (f) The practice is discriminatory in that it is not offered to all 
trade buyers in the local market on the same terms without business 
reasons present to justify the difference in treatment.

    It is unlawful for an industry member to sell, offer for sale, or 
contract to sell to any trade buyer, or for any such trade buyer to 
purchase, offer to purchase, or contract to purchase any products (a) on 
consignment; or (b) under conditional sale; or (c) with the privilege of

part of the sale involves, directly or indirectly, the acquisition by 
such person of other products from the trade buyer or the agreement to 
acquire other products from the trade buyer. Transactions involving the 
bona fide return of products for ordinary and usual commercial reasons 
arising after the product has been sold are not prohibited.


<R05>
Sec. 11.22  Consignment sales.

    Consignment sales are arrangements wherein the trade buyer is under

as a sales transaction conditioned on the acquisition of other products. 
However, the exchange of a product for equal quantities (case for case) 
of the same type and brand of product, in containers of another size is 
not considered an acquisition of ``other'' products and is not 
prohibited if there was no direct or implied privilege of return 
extended when the product was originally sold. Industry members may make 
price adjustments on products eligible for exchange under this 
paragraph.


<R05>
Sec. 11.24  Other than a bona fide sale.

qualification or denial. The appeal should explain why the applicant 
believes that the label or bottle is in compliance with applicable laws 
and regulations. If no appeal is filed within 45 days after the date of

decision of TTB.
    (b) Informal resolution. Applicants may choose to pursue informal 
resolution of disagreements regarding correction sheets or

TTB officer. However, formal administrative appeals must comply with the 
provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 13.26  Decision after appeal of qualification or denial.

    (a) Decision. After considering any written arguments or evidence 
presented by the applicant, the appropriate TTB officer must issue a

approval or denial should stand, a copy of the application, marked 
``appeal denied,'' must be returned to the applicant with an explanation 
of the decision and the specific laws or regulations relied upon in 
qualifying or denying the application. If the decision is that the 
certificate of label approval, certificate of exemption from label 
approval, or distinctive liquor bottle application should be approved 
without qualification, the applicant should resubmit TTB Form 5100.31 
and the certificate will be issued.
    (b) Time limits for decision. Within 90 days of receipt of an 
appeal, the appropriate TTB officer must notify the appellant whether 
the appeal has been granted or denied. If an applicant requests an 
informal conference as part of an appeal, as authorized in Sec. 13.71, 
the 90-day period will begin 10 days after the date of the conference to 
allow for consideration of any written arguments, facts or evidence 
submitted after the conference. The appropriate TTB officer may extend 
this period of time once by an additional 90 days if he or she finds 
that unusual circumstances require additional time to consider the 
issues presented by an appeal. If the appropriate TTB officer extends 
the period, he or she must notify the applicant by letter, briefly 
explaining the issues presented by the label. If the appellant receives 
no decision from the appropriate TTB officer within the time periods set 
forth in this paragraph, the appellant may appeal as provided in Sec.

<R05>
Sec. 13.27  Second appeal of qualification or denial.

    (a) Form of appeal. The decision after appeal of qualification or 
denial may be appealed in writing to the appropriate TTB officer within 
45 days after the date of that decision. If the appropriate TTB officer 
concludes that the qualified approval or denial was correct, a copy of 
the application, marked ``appeal denied,'' must be returned to the 
applicant, with an explanation of the decision and the specific laws or 
regulations relied upon in qualifying or denying the application. If the 
appropriate TTB officer concludes that the certificate of label 
approval, certificate of exemption from label approval, or distinctive 
liquor bottle application should be approved without qualification, the 
applicant may resubmit TTB Form 5100.31 and the certificate will be 
issued.
    (b) Time limits for decision after second appeal. Within 90 days of 
receipt of the second appeal, the appropriate TTB officer must notify 
the appellant whether the appeal has been granted or denied. If an 
applicant requests an informal conference as part of an appeal, as 
authorized in Sec. 13.71, the 90-day period will begin 10 days after 
the date of the conference to allow for consideration of any written 
arguments, facts or evidence submitted after the conference. The 
appropriate TTB officer may extend this period of time once, by an 
additional 90 days, if he or she finds that unusual circumstances 
require additional time to consider the unique issues presented by an 
appeal. If the appropriate TTB officer extends the time period, he or 
she must notify the applicant by letter, briefly explaining the issues 
presented by the label. The decision made on the second appeal shall be 
the final decision of TTB.
    (c) Judicial review. An appeal to the appropriate TTB officer is 
required prior to application to the Federal courts for review of any 
denial or qualification of an application.

revoked if the revocation occurs by operation of either TTB-administered 
law or regulation or applicable law or regulation of other agencies. If 
changes in labeling or other requirements are made as a result of

applications are not necessary. If a new application is unnecessary, it 
is the responsibility of the certificate holder to ensure that labels 
are in compliance with their requirements of the new regulations or law.

    When a third party (such as foreign government, another Federal

certificate holder, a consumer or consumer group, or any other 
interested person) wishes to comment on an approved certificate of label 
approval, certificate of exemption from label approval, or distinctive 
liquor bottle approval, such comments should be submitted in writing to 
the appropriate TTB officer who will review the subject of the comment.

statutory or regulatory authority, or the appropriate TTB officer 
determines that the certificate is in compliance with applicable law and 
regulations, the commenter will be informed that no further action will 
be taken. If the appropriate TTB officer determines that the commenter 
has raised a valid issue that TTB has authority to address, he or she 
will initiate appropriate action. The appropriate TTB officer may, in 
his or her discretion, notify the commenter as to the action being taken 
by TTB with respect to the certificate.

    (b) Use of certificate during period of appeal. If a certificate 
holder files a timely appeal after receipt of a decision to revoke a 
certificate pursuant to Sec. 13.44, the holder may continue to use the 
certificate at issue until the effective date of a final decision issued 
by the appropriate TTB officer. However, the effective date of a notice

approval, certificate of exemption from label approval, or distinctive 
liquor bottle approval has been manually canceled or not, the 
certificate is null and void after the effective date of the revocation.

applicant by first class mail, or by personal delivery. TTB must serve 
notices of proposed revocation and notices of revocation on a

commercial delivery service that will provide an equivalent written 
acknowledgment from the recipient, or by personal delivery.
    (b) Date of receipt. If there is a time limit on a certificate 
holder's action that runs from the holder's receipt of a document, the 
date of receipt may be established by a certified mail receipt, an 
equivalent written acknowledgment secured by a commercial delivery 
service, or by a written acknowledgment of personal delivery.
    (c) Person to be served. When service is by mail or other commercial 
delivery service, a copy of the document must be sent to the applicant 
or certificate holder at the address stated in the application or at the 
last known address. If authorized by the applicant or certificate

already on file and in effect; otherwise a superseding bond covering the 
entire liability shall be filed. Strengthening bonds, filed to increase 
the bond liability of the surety, shall not be construed in any sense to 
be substitute bonds, and the appropriate TTB officer shall not approve a 
strengthening bond containing any notation which may be interpreted as a 
release of any former bond or as limiting the amount of either bond to 
less than its full amount.

bonds.

interests of the Government demand it, or in any case where the security 
of the bond becomes impaired in whole or in part for any reason 
whatever, the principal shall file a superseding bond. A superseding 
bond shall be filed immediately in case of the insolvency of the surety. 
If a bond is found to be not acceptable or for any reason becomes 
invalid or of no effect, the principal shall immediately file a 
satisfactory superseding bond.
    (d) A bond filed under this section to supersede an existing bond 
shall be marked by the obligors at the time of execution, ``Superseding 
Bond.'' When such a bond is approved, the superseded bond shall be 
released as to transactions occurring wholly subsequent to the effective 
date of the superseding bond, and notice of termination of the 
superseded bond shall be issued, as provided in Sec. 17.111.

withdrawn, in writing, before the date named in it, the notice shall 
take effect on that date. The date shall not be less than 60 days after 
the date on which both the notice and proof of service on the principal 
have been received by the appropriate TTB officer. The surety shall 
deliver one copy of the notice to the principal and the original to the 
appropriate TTB officer. The surety shall also file with the appropriate

used in alcoholic beverages, and shall specify whether the proposed 
change is intended as a substitution or merely as an alternative for the 
original formula. No changes may be made to current formulas without 
specific TTB approval in each case.

<R05>
Sec. 17.123  Statement of process.

    Any person claiming drawback under the regulations in this part may 
be required, at any time, to file a statement of process, in addition to 
that required by TTB Form 5154.1, as well as any other data necessary 
for consideration of the claim for drawback. When pertinent to 
consideration of the claim, submission of copies of the commercial 
labels used on the finished products may also be required.


<R05>
Sec. 17.124  Samples.

    Any person claiming drawback or submitting a formula for approval 
under the regulations in this part may be required, at any time, to 
submit a sample of each nonbeverage or intermediate product for 
analysis. If the product is manufactured with a mixture of oil or other 
ingredients, the composition of which is unknown to the claimant, a 1-
ounce sample of the mixture shall be submitted with the sample of 
finished product when so required.


<R05>
Sec. 17.125  Adoption of formulas and processes.

    (a) Adoption of predecessor's formulas. If there is a change in the 
proprietorship of a nonbeverage plant and the successor desires to use 
the predecessor's formulas at the same location, the successor may, in 
lieu of submitting new formulas in its own name, adopt any or all of the 
formulas of the predecessor by filing a notice of adoption with the 
appropriate TTB officer. The notice shall be filed with the first claim 
relating to any of the adopted formulas. The notice shall list, by name 
and serial number, all formulas to be adopted, and shall state that the 
products will be manufactured in accordance with the adopted formulas 
and processes. The notice shall be accompanied by a certified copy of 
the articles of incorporation or other document(s) necessary to prove 
the transfer of ownership. The manufacturer shall retain a copy of the 
notice with the related formulas.
    (b) Adoption of manufacturer's own formulas from a different 
location. A manufacturer's own formulas may be adopted for use at 
another of the manufacturer's plants. Further, a wholly owned subsidiary 
may adopt the formulas of the parent company, and vice versa. A 
letterhead notice must be filed with the appropriate TTB officer and be 
accompanied by two photocopies of each formula to be adopted. The notice 
shall list the numbers of all formulas to be adopted and shall indicate 
the plant where each was originally approved and the plant(s) where each 
is to be adopted. Some evidence of the relationship between the plants 
involved in the

[[Page 331]]

adoption shall be attached to the notice. The notice shall be referenced 
in Part IV of the supporting data (TTB Form 5154.2) filed with the first 
claim relating to the adopted formula(s).

66 FR 5471, Jan. 19, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 17.126  Formulas for intermediate products.

    (a) The manufacturer shall submit a formula on TTB Form 5154.1 for 
each self-manufactured ingredient made with taxpaid spirits and intended 
for the manufacturer's own use in nonbeverage products, unless the 
formula for any such ingredient is fully expressed as part of the 
approved formula for each nonbeverage product in which that ingredient 
is used, or unless the formula for the ingredient is contained in one of 
the pharmaceutical publications listed in Sec. 17.132.
    (b) Upon receipt of Form 5154.1 covering a self-manufactured 
ingredient made with taxpaid spirits, the formula shall be examined 
under Sec. 17.131. If the formula is approved for drawback, the 
ingredient shall be treated as a finished nonbeverage product for 
purposes of this part, rather than as an intermediate product, 
notwithstanding its use by the manufacturer. (For example, see Sec. 
17.152(d).) If the formula is disapproved for drawback, the ingredient 
may be treated as an intermediate product in accordance with this part. 
Requirements pertaining to intermediate products are found in Sec. 
17.185(b).
    (c) If there is a change in the composition of an intermediate 
product, the manufacturer shall submit an amended or revised formula, as 
provided in Sec. 17.122.


<R05>
Sec. 17.127  Self-manufactured ingredients treated optionally as 
unfinished nonbeverage products.

    A self-manufactured ingredient made with taxpaid spirits, which 
otherwise would be treated as an intermediate product, may instead be 
treated as an unfinished nonbeverage product, if the ingredient's 
formula is fully expressed as a part of the approved formula for the 
nonbeverage product in which the ingredient will be used. A manufacturer 
desiring to change the treatment of an ingredient from ``intermediate 
product'' to ``unfinished nonbeverage product'' (or vice versa) may do 
so by resubmitting the applicable formula(s) on TTB Form 5154.1. 
Requirements pertaining to unfinished nonbeverage products are found in 
Sec. 17.185(c).

                          Approval of Formulas


<R05>
Sec. 17.131  Formulas on TTB Form 5154.1.

    Upon receipt, formulas on TTB Form 5154.1 shall be examined and, if 
found to be medicines, medicinal preparations, food products, flavors, 
flavoring extracts, or perfume which are unfit for beverage purposes and 
which otherwise meet the requirements of law and this part, they shall 
be approved for drawback. If the formulas do not meet the requirements 
of the law and regulations for drawback products, they shall be 
disapproved.


<R05>
Sec. 17.132  U.S.P., N.F., and H.P.U.S. preparations.

    (a) General. Except as otherwise provided by paragraph (b) of this 
section or by TTB ruling, formulas for compounds in which alcohol is a 
prescribed quantitative ingredient, which are stated in the current 
revisions or editions of the United States Pharmacopoeia (U.S.P.), the 
National Formulary (N.F.), or the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the 
United States (H.P.U.S.), shall be considered as approved formulas and 
may be used as formulas for drawback products without the filing of TTB 
Form 5154.1.
    (b) Exceptions. Alcohol (including dehydrated alcohol and dehydrated 
alcohol injection), U.S.P.; alcohol and dextrose injection, U.S.P.; and 
tincture of ginger, H.P.U.S., have been found to be fit for beverage use 
and are disapproved for drawback. All attenuations of other H.P.U.S. 
products diluted beyond one part in 10,000 (``4x'') are also disapproved 
for drawback, unless the manufacturer receives approval for a formula 
submitted on Form 5154.1 in accordance with this subpart. The formula 
for such attenuations shall be submitted with a sample of the product 
and a statement explaining why it should be classified as unfit for 
beverage use.

[[Page 332]]


<R05>
Sec. 17.133  Food product formulas.

    Formulas for nonbeverage food products on TTB Form 5154.1 may be 
approved if they are unfit for beverage purposes. Approval does not 
authorize manufacture or sale contrary to State law. Examples of food 
products that have been found to be unfit for beverage purposes are 
stated below:
    (a) Sauces or syrups. Sauces, or syrups consisting of sugar 
solutions and distilled spirits, in which the alcohol content is not 
more than 12 percent by volume and the sugar content is not less than 60 
grams per 100 cubic centimeters.
    (b) Brandied fruits. Brandied fruits consisting of solidly packaged 
fruits, either whole or segmented, and distilled spirits products not 
exceeding the quantity and alcohol content necessary for flavoring and 
preserving. Generally, brandied fruits will be considered to have met 
these standards if the container is well filled, the alcohol in the 
liquid portion does not exceed 23 percent by volume, and the liquid 
portion does not exceed 45 percent of the volume of the container.
    (c) Candies. Candies with alcoholic fillings, if the fillings meet 
the standards prescribed for sauces and syrups by paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (d) Other food products. Food products such as mincemeat, plum 
pudding, and fruit cake, where only sufficient distilled spirits are 
used for flavoring and preserving; and ice cream and ices where only 
sufficient spirits are used for flavoring purposes. Also food adjuncts, 
such as preservatives, emulsifying agents, and food colorings, that are 
unfit for beverage purposes and are manufactured and used, or sold for 
use, in food.


<R05>
Sec. 17.134  Determination of unfitness for beverage purposes.

    The appropriate TTB officer has responsibility for determining 
whether products are fit or unfit for beverage purposes within the 
meaning of 26 U.S.C. 5111. This determination may be based either on the 
content and description of the ingredients as shown on TTB Form 5154.1, 
or on organoleptic examination. In such examination, samples of products 
may be diluted with water to an alcoholic concentration of 15% and 
tasted. Sale or use for beverage purposes is indicative of fitness for 
beverage use.

    Effective Date Note: By T.D. TTB-79, 74 FR 37402, July 28, 2009, 
Sec. 17.134 was amended in the first sentence by removing the reference 
``26 U.S.C. 5131'' and adding, in its place, the reference ``26 U.S.C. 
5111'', effective July 28, 2009 through July 30, 2012.


<R05>
Sec. 17.135  Use of specially denatured alcohol (S.D.A.).

    (a) Use of S.D.A. in nonbeverage or intermediate products--(1) 
General. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the use of 
specially denatured alcohol (S.D.A.) and taxpaid spirits in the same 
product by a nonbeverage manufacturer is prohibited where drawback of 
tax is claimed.
    (2) Alternative formulations. No formula for a product on TTB Form 
5154.1 shall be approved for drawback under this subpart if the 
manufacturer also has on file an approved TTB Form 1479-A or Form 
5150.19, Formula for Article Made With Specially Denatured Alcohol or 
Rum, pertaining to the same product.
    (b) Use of S.D.A. in ingredients--(1) Purchased ingredients. 
Generally, purchased ingredients containing S.D.A. may be used in 
nonbeverage or intermediate products. However, such ingredients shall 
not be used in medicinal preparations or flavoring extracts intended for 
internal human use, where any of the S.D.A. remains in the finished 
product.
    (2) Self-manufactured ingredients. Self-manufactured ingredients may 
be made with S.D.A. and used in nonbeverage or intermediate products, 
provided--
    (i) No taxpaid spirits are used in manufacturing such ingredients; 
and
    (ii) All S.D.A. is recovered or dissipated from such ingredients 
prior to their use in nonbeverage or intermediate products. (Recovery of 
S.D.A. shall be in accordance with subpart K of part 20 of this chapter; 
recovered S.D.A., with or without its original denaturants, shall not be 
reused in nonbeverage or intermediate products.)

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1372, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5273))

[[Page 333]]


<R05>
Sec. 17.136  Compliance with Food and Drug Administration requirements.

    A product is not a medicine, medicinal preparation, food product, 
flavor, flavoring extract, or perfume for nonbeverage drawback if its 
formula would violate a ban or restriction of the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) pertaining to such products. If FDA bans or 
restricts the use of any ingredient in such a way that further 
manufacture of a product in accordance with its formula would violate 
the ban or restriction, then the manufacturer shall change the formula 
and resubmit it on TTB Form 5154.1 . This section does not preclude 
approval for products manufactured solely for export or for uses other 
than internal human consumption (e.g. tobacco flavors or animal feed 
flavors) in accordance with laws and regulations administered by FDA. 
Under Sec. 17.123, manufacturers may be required to demonstrate 
compliance with FDA requirements applicable to this section.


<R05>
Sec. 17.137  Formulas disapproved for drawback.

    A formula may be disapproved for drawback either because it does not 
prescribe appropriate ingredients in sufficient quantities to make the 
product unfit for beverage use, or because the product is neither a 
medicine, a medicinal preparation, a food product, a flavor, nor a 
flavoring extract. The formula for a disapproved product may be used as 
an intermediate product formula under Sec. 17.126. No drawback will be 
allowed on distilled spirits used in a disapproved product, unless that 
product is later used in the manufacture of an approved nonbeverage 
product. In the case of a product that is disapproved because it is fit 
for beverage use, any further use or disposition of such a product, 
other than as an intermediate product in accordance with this part, 
subjects the manufacturer to the qualification requirements of parts 1 
and 19 of this chapter.


<R04>
                      Subpart G_Claims for Drawback


<R05>
Sec. 17.141  Drawback.

    Upon the filing of a claim as provided in this subpart, drawback 
shall be allowed to any person who meets the requirements of this part. 
Drawback shall be paid at the rate specified by 26 U.S.C. 5114 on each 
proof gallon of distilled spirits on which the tax has been paid or 
determined and which have been used in the manufacture of nonbeverage 
products. The drawback rate is $1.00 less than the effective tax rate. 
Drawback shall be allowed only to the extent that the claimant can 
establish, by evidence satisfactory to the appropriate TTB, the actual 
quantity of taxpaid or tax-determined distilled spirits used in the 
manufacture of the product, and the effective tax rate applicable to 
those spirits.

    Effective Date Note: By T.D. TTB-79, 74 FR 37402, July 28, 2009, 
Sec. 17.141 was amended in the second sentence, by removing the 
reference ``26 U.S.C. 5134'' and adding, in its place, the reference 
``26 U.S.C. 5114'' and by removing the last sentence, effective July 28, 
2009 through July 30, 2012.


<R05>
Sec. 17.142  Claims.

    (a) General. The manufacturer must file claim for drawback with the 
appropriate TTB officer who has the authority to approve or disapprove 
claims. A separate claim shall be filed for each place of business. Each 
claim shall pertain only to distilled spirits used in the manufacture or 
production of nonbeverage products during any one quarter of the tax 
year. Unless the manufacturer is eligible to file monthly claims (see 
Sec. Sec. 17.143 and 17.144), only one claim per quarter may be filed 
for each place of business. Claims shall be filed on TTB Form 2635 
(5620.8), Claim--Alcohol and Tobacco Taxes.
    (b) Manufacturers who are also proprietors of distilled spirits 
plants. If a manufacturer of nonbeverage products is owned and operated 
by the same business entity that owns and operates a distilled spirits 
plant, the manufacturer's claim for drawback may be filed for credit on 
Form 2635 (5620.8). After the claim is approved, the distilled spirits 
plant may use the claim as an adjustment decreasing the taxes due in 
Schedule B of TTB Form 5000.24, Excise Tax Return. Adjustments resulting 
from an approved drawback claim are not subject to interest. This 
procedure may be utilized only if the manufacturer of nonbeverage 
products and the

[[Page 334]]

distilled spirits plant have the same employer identification number.

[T.D. ATF-179, 61 FR 31412, June 20, 1996, as amended by T.D. ATF-436, 
66 FR 5471, Jan. 19, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 17.143  Notice for monthly claims.

    If the manufacturer has notified the appropriate TTB officer, in 
writing, of an intention to file claims on a monthly basis instead of a 
quarterly basis, and has filed a bond in compliance with the provisions 
of this part, claims may be filed monthly instead of quarterly. The 
election to file monthly claims shall not preclude a manufacturer from 
filing a single claim covering an entire quarter, or a single claim 
covering just two months of a quarter, or two claims (one of them 
covering one month and the other covering two months). An election for 
the filing of monthly claims may be withdrawn by the manufacturer by 
filing a notice to that effect, in writing, with the appropriate TTB 
officer.


<R05>
Sec. 17.144  Bond for monthly claims.

    Each person intending to file claims for drawback on a monthly basis 
shall file an executed bond on TTB Form 5154.3, conforming to the 
provisions of subpart E of this part. A monthly drawback claim shall not 
be allowed until bond coverage in a sufficient amount has been approved 
by the appropriate TTB officer. When the limit of liability under a bond 
given in less than the maximum amount has been reached, further drawback 
on monthly claims may be suspended until a strengthening or superseding 
bond in a sufficient amount is furnished.


<R05>
Sec. 17.145  Date of filing claim.

    Quarterly claims for drawback shall be filed within six months after 
the quarter in which the distilled spirits covered by the claim were 
used in the manufacture of nonbeverage products. Monthly claims for 
drawback may be filed at any time after the end of the month in which 
the distilled spirits covered by the claim were used in the manufacture 
of nonbeverage products, but shall be filed not later than the close of 
the sixth month succeeding the quarter in which the spirits were used.


<R05>
Sec. 17.146  Information to be shown by the claim.

    The claim shall show the following:
    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) That the distilled spirits on which drawback is claimed were 
fully taxpaid or tax-determined at the effective tax rate applicable to 
the distilled spirits.
    (c) That the distilled spirits on which the drawback is claimed were 
used in the manufacture of nonbeverage products.
    (d) Whether the nonbeverage products were manufactured in compliance 
with quantitative formulas approved under subpart F of this part. (If 
not, attach explanation.)
    (e) That the data submitted in support of the claim are correct.

    Effective Date Note: By T.D. TTB-79, 74 FR 37402, July 28, 2009, 
Sec. 17.146 was amended in the introductory text by removing the words 
``set forth'' and adding, in their place, the word ``show'', and by 
removing and reserving paragraph (a), effective July 28, 2009 through 
July 30, 2012.


<R05>
Sec. 17.147  Supporting data.

    (a) Each claim for drawback shall be accompanied by supporting data 
presented according to the format shown on TTB Form 5154.2, Supporting 
Data for Nonbeverage Drawback Claims (or according to any other suitable 
format which provides the same information). Modifications of Form 
5154.2 may be used without prior authorization, if the modified format 
clearly shows all of the required information that is pertinent to the 
manufacturing operation. Under Sec. 17.123, the appropriate TTB officer 
may require additional supporting data when needed to determine the 
correctness of drawback claims.
    (b) Separate data shall be shown for eligible distilled spirits 
taxpaid at different effective tax rates. This requirement applies to 
all eligible spirits, including eligible recovered alcohol and eligible 
spirits contained in intermediate products.
    (c) Separate data shall be shown for imported rum, spirits from 
Puerto Rico containing at least 92% rum, and spirits from the U.S. 
Virgin Islands containing at least 92% rum. The total number of proof 
gallons of each such category used subject to drawback during the claim 
period shall also be

[[Page 335]]

shown, with separate totals for each effective tax rate. These amounts 
shall include eligible spirits and rum from intermediate products or 
recovered alcohol.
    (d) Any gain in eligible distilled spirits reported in the 
supporting data shall be reflected by an equivalent deduction from the 
amount of drawback claimed. Gains shall not be offset by known losses.


<R05>
Sec. 17.148  Allowance of claims.

    (a) General. Except in the case of fraudulent noncompliance, no 
claim for drawback shall be denied for a failure to comply with either 
26 U.S.C. 5111-5114 or the requirements of this part, if the claimant 
establishes that spirits on which the tax has been paid or determined 
were in fact used in the manufacture of medicines, medicinal 
preparations, food products, flavors, flavoring extracts, or perfume, 
which were unfit for beverage purposes.
    (b) Penalty. Noncompliance with the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 5111-
5114 or of this part subjects the claimant to a civil penalty of $1,000 
for each separate product, reflected in a claim for drawback, to which 
the noncompliance relates, or the amount claimed for that product, 
whichever is less, unless the claimant establishes that the 
noncompliance was due to reasonable cause. Late filing of a claim 
subjects the claimant to a civil penalty of $1,000 or the amount of the 
claim, whichever is less, unless the claimant establishes that the 
lateness was due to reasonable cause.
    (c) Reasonable cause. Reasonable cause exists where a claimant 
establishes it exercised ordinary business care and prudence, and still 
was unable to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Ignorance of law or regulations, in and of itself, is not reasonable 
cause. Each case is individually evaluated.

                       Spirits Subject to Drawback


<R05>
Sec. 17.151  Use of distilled spirits.

    Distilled spirits are considered to have been used in the 
manufacture of a product under this part if the spirits are consumed in 
the manufacture, are incorporated into the product, or are determined by 
TTB to have been otherwise utilized as an essential part of the 
manufacturing process. However, spirits lost by causes such as spillage, 
leakage, breakage or theft, and spirits used for purposes such as 
rinsing or cleaning a system, are not considered to have been used in 
the manufacture of a product.


<R05>
Sec. 17.152  Time of use of spirits.

    (a) General. Distilled spirits shall be considered used in the 
manufacture of a product as soon as that product contains all the 
ingredients called for by its formula.
    (b) Spirits used in an ion exchange column. Distilled spirits used 
in recharging an ion exchange column, the operation of which is 
essential to the production of a product, shall be considered to be used 
when the spirits are entered into the manufacturing system in accordance 
with the product's formula.
    (c) Products requiring additional processing or treatment. Further 
manipulation of a product, such as aging or filtering, subsequent to the 
mixing together of all of its ingredients, shall not postpone the time 
when spirits are considered used, as determined under paragraph (a) of 
this section. This is true even if at the time of use there has not yet 
been a final determination of alcoholic content by assay. If, however, 
it is later found necessary to add more distilled spirits to standardize 
the product, such added spirits shall be considered as used in the 
period during which they were added.
    (d) Nonbeverage products used to manufacture other products. 
Nonbeverage products may be used to manufacture other nonbeverage (or 
intermediate)

[[Page 336]]

products. However, such subsequent usage of a nonbeverage product shall 
not affect the time when the distilled spirits contained therein are 
considered used. When distilled spirits are used in the manufacture of a 
nonbeverage product, the time of use shall be the point at which that 
product first contains all of its prescribed ingredients, and such use 
shall not be determined by the time of any subsequent usage of that 
product in another product.


<R05>
Sec. 17.153  Recovered spirits.

    (a) Recovery from intermediate products. Eligible spirits recovered 
in the manufacture of intermediate products are not subject to drawback 
until such recovered spirits are used in the manufacture of a 
nonbeverage product. (However, see Sec. 17.127 with respect to optional 
treatment of ingredients as unfinished nonbeverage products, rather than 
as intermediate products.) Spirits recovered in the manufacture of 
intermediate products shall be reused only in the manufacture of 
intermediate or nonbeverage products.
    (b) Recovery from nonbeverage products. Distilled spirits recovered 
in the manufacture of a nonbeverage product are considered as having 
been used in the manufacture of that product. If the spirits were 
eligible when so used, they became subject to drawback at that time. 
Upon recovery, such spirits may be reused in the manufacture of 
nonbeverage products, but shall not be reused for any other purpose. 
When reused, such recovered spirits are not again eligible for drawback 
and shall not be used in the manufacture of intermediate products.
    (c) Cross references. For additional provisions respecting the 
recovery of distilled spirits and related recordkeeping requirements, 
see Sec. Sec. 17.168 and 17.183.


<R05>
Sec. 17.154  Spirits contained in intermediate products.

    Spirits contained in an intermediate product are not subject to 
drawback until that intermediate product is used in the manufacture of a 
nonbeverage product.


<R05>
Sec. 17.155  Spirits consumed in manufacturing intermediate products.

    Spirits consumed in the manufacture of an intermediate product--
which are not contained in the intermediate product at the time of its 
use in nonbeverage products--are not subject to drawback. Such spirits 
are not considered to have been used in the manufacture of nonbeverage 
products. However, see Sec. 17.127 with respect to optional treatment 
of ingredients as unfinished nonbeverage products, rather than as 
intermediate products.


<R04>
                            Subpart H_Records


<R05>
Sec. 17.161  General.

    Each person claiming drawback on taxpaid distilled spirits used in 
the manufacture of nonbeverage products shall maintain records showing 
the information required in this subpart. No particular form is 
prescribed for these records, but the data required to be shown shall be 
clearly recorded and organized to enable appropriate TTB officers to 
trace each operation or transaction, monitor compliance with law and 
regulations, and verify the accuracy of each claim. Ordinary business 
records, including invoices and cost accounting records, are acceptable 
if they show the required information or are annotated to show any such 
information that is lacking. The records shall be kept complete and 
current at all times and shall be retained by the manufacturer at the 
place where the taxpaid distilled spirits are used in the manufacture or 
production of nonbeverage products, for the period prescribed in Sec. 
17.170.

    Effective Date Note: By T.D. TTB-79, 74 FR 37402, July 28, 2009, 
Sec. 17.161 was amended by revising the last sentence, effective July 
28, 2009 through July 30, 2012.


<R05>
Sec. 17.162  Receipt of distilled spirits.

    (a) Distilled spirits received in tank cars, tank trucks, barrels, 
or drums. For distilled spirits received in tank cars, tank trucks, 
barrels, or drums, the manufacturer shall record, with respect to each 
shipment received--
    (1) The date of receipt;
    (2) The name and address of the person from whom received;

[[Page 337]]

    (3) The serial number or other identification mark (if any) of each 
tank car, tank truck, barrel, or drum;
    (4) The name of the producer or warehouseman who paid or determined 
the tax;
    (5) The effective tax rate (if other than the rate prescribed by 26 
U.S.C. 5001); and
    (6) The kind, quantity, and proof (or alcohol percentage by volume) 
of the spirits.
    (b) Distilled spirits received in bottles. For distilled spirits 
received in bottles, the manufacturer shall record--
    (1) The date of receipt;
    (2) The name and address of the seller;
    (3) The serial number of each case, if the bottles are received in 
cases;
    (4) The name of the bottler;
    (5) The effective tax rate (if other than the rate prescribed by 26 
U.S.C. 5001); and
    (6) The kind, quantity, and proof (or alcohol percentage by volume) 
of the spirits.
    (c) Distilled spirits received by pipeline. For distilled spirits 
received by pipeline, the manufacturer shall record--
    (1) The date of receipt;
    (2) The name of the producer or warehouseman who paid or determined 
the tax;
    (3) The effective tax rate (if other than the rate prescribed by 26 
U.S.C. 5001); and
    (4) The kind, quantity, and proof (or alcohol percentage by volume) 
of the spirits.
    (d) Determination of quantity. At the time of receipt, each 
manufacturer shall determine (preferably by weight) and record the exact 
number of proof gallons of distilled spirits received. The amount 
received in bottles may be determined by the required statements on the 
labels. The amount received in sealed drums with no evidence of leakage 
may be determined from the record of shipment, which is required by 
Sec. 19.780 of this chapter to accompany spirits received from a 
distilled spirits plant. If spirits are received in a tank car or tank 
truck, and the result of the manufacturer's gauge of the spirits is 
within 0.2 percent of the number of proof gallons reported on the record 
of shipment required by Sec. 19.780, then the number of proof gallons 
reported on that record may be recorded as the quantity received. 
Nevertheless, the receiving gauge shall be noted on the record of 
receipt. If, for any shipment, the amount recorded in the manufacturer's 
records as the quantity received is greater than the amount shown as 
taxpaid on the record required by Sec. 19.780, a deduction equivalent 
to the excess shall be made from the amount of drawback claimed in the 
manufacturer's claim covering that period. If no claim is filed for that 
period, then the deduction shall be made in the manufacturer's next 
claim. Losses in transit that exceed the 0.2 percent limitation provided 
in this paragraph shall be determined and noted on the record of 
receipt. Such losses shall not be recorded as distilled spirits 
received.
    (e) Receipt of imported rum, or spirits from Puerto Rico or the 
Virgin Islands. If spirits are received which contain at least 92% rum, 
and which originate from Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands, the 
record of receipt shall indicate the place of origin. If rum is 
received, the record shall indicate whether it is from Puerto Rico, from 
the U.S. Virgin Islands, imported from other countries, or domestic.
    (f) Shipments from distilled spirits plants. If spirits are received 
directly from the distilled spirits plant that paid or determined the 
tax, the manufacturer shall retain the record of shipment required by 
Sec. 19.780 of this chapter. To the extent that the information on that 
record duplicates the requirements of this section, retention of that 
record shall satisfy those requirements. If there are differences 
between the information on the record of shipment and the information 
required to be recorded by this section, the requirements of this 
section may be met by appropriate annotations on the record of shipment.


<R05>
Sec. 17.163  Evidence of taxpayment of distilled spirits.

    (a) Shipments from distilled spirits plants. For each shipment of 
taxpaid spirits from the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant, 
the manufacturer shall obtain the record of shipment prepared by the 
supplier under Sec. 19.780 of this chapter. This record

[[Page 338]]

shall be retained with the commercial invoice (if the latter is a 
separate document) as evidence of taxpayment of the spirits. The record 
shall show the effective tax rate(s) (if other than the rate prescribed 
by 26 U.S.C. 5001) applicable to the shipment.
    (b) Purchases from wholesale and retail liquor dealers. 
Manufacturers shall obtain commercial invoices or other documentation 
pertaining to purchases of distilled spirits from wholesale and retail 
liquor dealers (including such dealership operations when conducted in 
conjunction with a distilled spirits plant). For spirits other than 
alcohol, grain spirits, neutral spirits, distilled gin, or straight 
whisky (as defined in the standards of identity prescribed by Sec. 5.22 
of this chapter), the manufacturer of nonbeverage products shall obtain 
evidence, from the producer or bottler of the spirits, as to the 
effective tax rate paid thereon.
    (c) Imported spirits. For imported spirits that were taxpaid through 
Customs, evidence of such taxpayment (such as Customs Forms 7501 and 
7505, receipted to indicate payment of tax, and the certificate of 
effective tax rate computation, if applicable) shall be secured from the 
importer and retained by the manufacturer.
    (d) Evidence of effective tax rate. If the evidence of effective tax 
rate, required by this section for distilled spirits products that may 
contain wine or flavors, is not obtained, drawback shall only be allowed 
based on the lowest effective tax rate possible for the kind of 
distilled spirits product used.


<R05>
Sec. 17.164  Production record.

    (a) General. Each manufacturer shall keep a production record for 
each batch of intermediate product and for each batch of nonbeverage 
product. The production record shall be an original record made at the 
time of production by a person (or persons) having actual knowledge 
thereof. If any product is produced by a continuous process rather than 
by batches, the production record shall pertain to the total quantity of 
that product produced during each claim period.
    (b) Information to be shown. The record shall show the name and 
formula number of the product, the actual quantities of all ingredients 
used in the manufacture of the batch (including the proof or alcohol 
percentage by volume of all spirits), the date when eligible spirits 
were considered used (see Sec. 17.152), the effective tax rate 
applicable to those spirits (if other than the rate prescribed by 26 
U.S.C. 5001), and the quantity of product produced. The alcohol content 
of the product shall be shown if a test of alcohol content was made (see 
paragraph (e) of this section). Usage of eligible and ineligible spirits 
shall be shown separately. If spirits from Puerto Rico or the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, containing at least 92% rum, were used, the record shall 
indicate their place of origin. If rum was used, the record shall 
indicate whether it was from Puerto Rico, from the U.S. Virgin Islands, 
imported from other countries, or domestic. If spirits were recovered, 
the production record shall so indicate, and the record required by 
Sec. 17.168 shall be kept. If drawback is claimed on spirits consumed 
as an essential part of the manufacture of a nonbeverage product, which 
were not contained in that product at its completion, then the 
production record shall show the quantity of spirits so consumed in the 
manufacture of each batch.
    (c) Specificity of information. The production record shall refer to 
ingredients by the same names as are used for them in the product's 
formula. This includes formulas submitted to TTB and formulas contained 
in the publications listed in Sec. 17.132. Other names for the 
ingredients may be added in the production record, if necessary for the 
manufacturer's operations. Usage of ingredients (including spirits) may 
be shown in units of weight or volume.
    (d) Determining quantity of distilled spirits used. Each 
manufacturer shall accurately determine, by weight or volume, and record 
in the production records the quantity of all distilled spirits used. 
When the quantity used is determined by volume, adjustments shall be 
made if the temperature of the spirits is above or below 60 degrees 
Fahrenheit. A table for correction of volume of spirituous liquors to 60 
degrees Fahrenheit, Table 7 of the ``Gauging Manual,'' is available. See 
subpart E of part 30 of this chapter and

[[Page 339]]

Sec. 30.67. Losses after receipt due to leakage, spillage, evaporation, 
or other causes not essential to the manufacturing process shall be 
accurately recorded in the manufacturer's permanent records at the time 
such losses are determined.
    (e) Tests of alcohol content. At representative intervals, the 
manufacturer shall verify the alcohol content of nonbeverage products. 
The results of such tests shall be recorded.


<R05>
Sec. 17.165  Receipt of raw ingredients.

    For raw ingredients destined to be used in nonbeverage or 
intermediate products, the manufacturer shall record, for each shipment 
received--
    (a) The date of receipt;
    (b) The quantity received; and
    (c) The identity of the supplier.


<R05>
Sec. 17.166  Disposition of nonbeverage products.

    (a) Shipments. For each shipment of nonbeverage products, the 
manufacturer shall record--
    (1) The formula number of the product;
    (2) The date of shipment;
    (3) The quantity shipped; and
    (4) The identity of the consignee.
    (b) Other disposition. For other dispositions of nonbeverage 
products, the manufacturer shall record--
    (1) The type of disposition;
    (2) The date of disposition; and
    (3) The quantity of each product so disposed of.
    (c) Exception. The manufacturer need not keep the records required 
by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for any nonbeverage product 
which either contains less than 3 percent of distilled spirits by 
volume, or is sold by the producer directly to the consumer in retail 
quantities. However, when needed for protection of the revenue, the 
appropriate TTB officer may at any time require the keeping of these 
records upon giving at least five days' notice to the manufacturer.


<R05>
Sec. 17.167  Inventories.

    (a) Distilled spirits. The ``on hand'' figures reported in Part II 
of TTB Form 5154.2 shall be verified by physical inventories taken as of 
the end of each quarter in which nonbeverage products were manufactured 
for purposes of drawback. Spirits taxpaid at different effective tax 
rates shall be inventoried separately. The inventory record shall show 
the date inventory was taken, the person(s) by whom it was taken, 
subtotals for each product inventoried, and any gains or losses 
disclosed; and shall be retained with the manufacturer's records. The 
manufacturer shall explain in Part IV of the supporting data (Form 
5154.2) any discrepancy between the amounts on hand as disclosed by 
physical inventory and the amounts indicated by the manufacturer's 
records. Any gain in eligible spirits disclosed by inventory requires an 
equivalent deduction from the claim with which the inventory is 
reported. Gains shall not be offset by known losses. If no claim is 
filed for a quarter (nor for any monthly period therein), then no 
physical inventory is required for that quarter.
    (b) Raw ingredients and nonbeverage products. When necessary for 
ensuring compliance with regulations and protection of the revenue, the 
appropriate TTB officer may require a manufacturer to take physical 
inventories of finished nonbeverage products, and/or raw ingredients 
intended for use in the manufacture of nonbeverage or intermediate 
products. The results of such inventories shall be recorded in the 
manufacturer's records. Any discrepancy between the amounts on hand as 
disclosed by physical inventory and such amounts as indicated by the 
manufacturer's records shall also be recorded with an explanation of its 
cause.


<R05>
Sec. 17.168  Recovered spirits.

    (a) Each manufacturer intending to recover distilled spirits under 
the provisions of this part shall first notify the appropriate TTB 
officer. Any apparatus used to separate alcohol is subject to the 
registration requirements of 26 U.S.C. 5179 and subpart C of part 29 of 
this chapter. Recovery operations may only be conducted on the premises 
where the recovered spirits were used in the manufacture or production 
of nonbeverage or intermediate products.
    (b) The manufacturer shall keep a record of the distilled spirits 
recovered

[[Page 340]]

and the subsequent use to which such spirits are put. The record shall 
show--
    (1) The date of recovery;
    (2) The commodity or process from which the spirits were recovered;
    (3) The amount in proof gallons, or by weight and proof (or alcohol 
percentage by volume) of distilled spirits recovered;
    (4) The amount in proof gallons, or by weight and proof (or alcohol 
percentage by volume) of recovered distilled spirits reused;
    (5) The commodity in which the recovered distilled spirits were 
reused; and
    (6) The date of reuse.
    (c) Whenever recovered spirits are destroyed (see Sec. 17.183), the 
record shall further show--
    (1) The reason for the destruction;
    (2) The date, time, location, and manner of destruction;
    (3) The number of proof gallons destroyed; and
    (4) The name of the individual who accomplished or supervised the 
destruction.

Sec. 17.169  Transfer of intermediate products.

    When intermediate products are transferred as permitted by Sec. 
17.185(b), supporting records of such transfers shall be kept at the 
shipping and receiving plants, showing the date and quantity of each 
product transferred.


<R05>
Sec. 17.170  Retention of records.

    Each manufacturer shall retain for a period of not less than 3 years 
all records required by this part, a copy of all claims and supporting 
data filed in support thereof, all commercial invoices or other 
documents evidencing taxpayment or tax-determination of domestic 
spirits, all documents evidencing taxpayment of imported spirits, and 
all bills of lading received which pertain to shipments of spirits. In 
addition, a copy of each formula submitted on TTB Form 5154.1 shall be 
retained at each factory where the formula is used, for not less than 3 
years from the date of filing of the last claim for drawback under the 
formula. A copy of an approval to use an alternate method or procedure 
shall be retained as long as the manufacturer employs the method or 
procedure, and for 3 years thereafter. Further, the appropriate TTB 
officer may require these records, forms, and documents to be retained 
for an additional period of not more than 3 years in any case where he 
or she deems such retention to be necessary or advisable for protection 
of the revenue.


<R05>
Sec. 17.171  Inspection of records.

    All of the records, forms, and documents required to be retained by 
Sec. 17.170 shall be kept at the premises where distilled spirits are 
used in the manufacture or production of nonbeverage products and shall 
be readily available during the manufacturer's regular business hours 
for examination and copying by the appropriate TTB officers. At the same 
time, any other books, papers, records or memoranda in the possession of 
the manufacturer, which have a bearing upon the matters required to be 
alleged in a claim for drawback, shall be available for inspection by 
appropriate TTB officers.

                   Subpart I_Miscellaneous Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 17.181  Exportation of medicinal preparations and flavoring extracts.

    Medicinal preparations and flavoring extracts, approved for drawback 
under the provisions of this part, may be exported subject to 19 U.S.C. 
1313(d), which authorizes export drawback equal to the entire amount of 
internal revenue tax found to have been paid on

[[Page 341]]

the domestic alcohol used in the manufacture of such products. (Note: 
Export drawback is not allowed for imported alcohol under this provision 
of customs law.) Claims for such export drawback shall be filed in 
accordance with the applicable regulations of the U.S. Customs Service. 
Such claims may cover either the full rate of tax which has been paid on 
the alcohol, if no nonbeverage drawback has been claimed thereon, or 
else the remainder of the tax if nonbeverage drawback under 26 U.S.C. 
5114 has been or will be claimed.

    Effective Date Note: By T.D. TTB-79, 74 FR 37402, July 28, 2009, 
Sec. 17.181 was amended in the last sentence by removing the reference 
``26 U.S.C. 5134'' and adding, in its place, the reference ``26 U.S.C.

<R05>
Sec. 17.182  Drawback claims by druggists.

    Drawback of tax under 26 U.S.C. 5114 is allowable on taxpaid 
distilled spirits used by druggists in compounding prescriptions. The 
prescriptions so compounded shall be shown in the supporting data by 
listing the first and last serial numbers thereof. The amount of taxpaid 
spirits used in each prescription need not be shown, but such 
prescriptions shall be made available for examination by appropriate TTB 
officers. If refills have been made of prescriptions received in a 
previous claim period, their serial numbers shall be recorded 
separately. Druggists claiming drawback as authorized by this section 
are subject to all the applicable requirements of this part, except 
those requiring the filing of quantitative formulas.

    Effective Date Note: By T.D. TTB-79, 74 FR 37402, July 28, 2009, 
Sec. 17.182 was amended by revising the first sentence, effective July 
28, 2009 through July 30, 2012.


<R05>
Sec. 17.183  Disposition of recovered alcohol and material from which
alcohol can be recovered.

    (a) Recovered alcohol. Manufacturers of nonbeverage products shall 
not sell or transfer recovered spirits to any other premises without TTB 
authorization under Sec. 17.3. If recovered spirits are stored pending 
reuse, storage facilities shall be adequate to protect the revenue. If 
recovered spirits are destroyed, the record required by Sec. 17.168(c) 
must be kept. Spirits recovered from intermediate products may be 
destroyed without notice to TTB. Spirits recovered from nonbeverage 
products may be destroyed pursuant to a notice filed with the 
appropriate TTB officer at least 12 days prior to the date of 
destruction. The notice shall state the reason for the destruction, the 
intended date of destruction, and the approximate quantity involved. The 
appropriate TTB officer may impose specific conditions, including 
requiring that the destruction be witnessed by an appropriate TTB. 
Unless the manufacturer is otherwise advised by the appropriate TTB 
officer before the date specified in the notice, the destruction may 
proceed as planned.
    (b) By-product material (general). By-product material from which 
alcohol can be recovered shall not be sold or transferred unless the 
alcohol has been removed or an approved substance has been added to 
prevent recovery of residual alcohol. Material from which alcohol can be 
recovered may also be destroyed on the manufacturer's premises by a 
suitable method. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, 
prior written approval shall be obtained from the appropriate TTB 
officer as to the adequacy, under this section, of any substance 
proposed to be added to prevent recovery of alcohol, or of any proposed 
method of destruction.
    (c) Spent vanilla beans. Specific approval from the appropriate TTB 
officer is not required when spent vanilla beans containing residual 
alcohol are destroyed on the manufacturer's premises by burning, or when 
they are removed from those premises after treatment with sufficient 
kerosene, mineral spirits, rubber hydrocarbon solvent, or gasoline to 
prevent recovery of residual alcohol.


<R05>
Sec. 17.184  Distilled spirits container marks.

    All marks required by Part 19 of this chapter shall remain on 
containers of taxpaid distilled spirits until the contents are emptied. 
Whenever such a container is emptied, such marks shall be completely 
obliterated.

(Sec. 454, Pub. L. 98-369, 98 Stat. 820 (26 U.S.C. 5206(d)))

[[Page 342]]


<R05>
Sec. 17.185  Requirements for intermediate products and unfinished
nonbeverage products.

    (a) General. Self-manufactured ingredients made with taxpaid spirits 
may be accounted for either as intermediate products or as unfinished 
nonbeverage products. The manufacturer may choose either method of 
accounting for such self-manufactured ingredients (see Sec. 17.127). 
However, the method selected determines the requirements that will apply 
to those ingredients, as prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section.
    (b) Intermediate products. Intermediate products shall be used 
exclusively in the manufacture of nonbeverage products. Intermediate 
products may be accumulated and stored indefinitely and may be used in 
any nonbeverage product whose formula calls for such use. Intermediate 
products shall be manufactured by the same entity that manufactures the 
finished nonbeverage products. Intermediate products shall not be sold 
or transferred between separate and distinct entities. However, they may 
be transferred to another branch or plant of the same manufacturer, for 
use there in the manufacture of approved nonbeverage products. (See 
Sec. 17.169 for recordkeeping requirement.) For the purposes of this 
section, the phrase ``separate and distinct entities'' includes parent 
and subsidiary corporations, regardless of any corporate (or other) 
relationship, and even if the stock of both the manufacturing firm and 
the receiving firm is owned by the same persons.
    (c) Unfinished nonbeverage products. An unfinished nonbeverage 
product shall only be used in the particular nonbeverage product for 
which it was manufactured, and shall be entirely so used within the time 
limit stated in the approved TTB Form 5154.1. Spirits dissipated or 
recovered in the manufacture of unfinished nonbeverage products shall be 
regarded as having been dissipated or recovered in the manufacture of 
nonbeverage products. Spirits contained in such unfinished products 
shall be accounted for in the supporting data under Sec. 17.147 and 
inventoried under Sec. 17.167 as ``in process'' in nonbeverage 
products. Production of unfinished nonbeverage products shall be 
recorded as an integral part of the production records for the related 
nonbeverage products. Unfinished nonbeverage products shall not be 
transferred to other premises.


<R05>
Sec. 17.186  Transfer of distilled spirits to other containers.

    A manufacturer may transfer taxpaid distilled spirits from the 
original package to other containers at any time for the purpose of 
facilitating the manufacture of products unfit for beverage use. 
Containers into which distilled spirits have been transferred under this 
section shall bear a label identifying their contents as taxpaid 
distilled spirits, and shall be marked with the serial number of the 
original package from which the spirits were withdrawn.


<R05>
Sec. 17.187  Discontinuance of business.

    The manufacturer shall notify TTB when business is to be 
discontinued. Upon discontinuance of business, a manufacturer's entire 
stock of taxpaid distilled spirits on hand may be sold in a single sale 
without the necessity of qualifying as a wholesaler under part 1 of this 
chapter or registering and keeping records as a liquor dealer under part 
31 of this chapter.The spirits likewise may be returned to the person 
from whom purchased, or they may be destroyed or given away.

produced in, imported into or brought into the United States at the rate 
prescribed in section 5001 on each proof gallon and a proportionate tax 
at a like rate on all fractional parts of a proof gallon. Wines 
containing more than 24 percent of alcohol by volume are taxed as 
spirits. All products of distillation, by whatever name known, which 
contain spirits, on which the tax imposed by law has not been paid, and 
any alcoholic ingredient added to such products, are considered and 
taxed as spirits.
    (b) A credit against the tax imposed on distilled spirits by 26 
U.S.C. 5001 or

[[Page 364]]

7652 is allowable under 26 U.S.C. 5010 on each proof gallon of alcohol 
derived from eligible wine or from eligible flavors which do not exceed 
2\1/2\ percent of the finished product on a proof gallon basis. The 
credit is allowable at the time the tax is payable as if it constituted 
a reduction in the rate of tax.
    (c) Where credit against the tax is desired, the person liable for 
the tax shall establish an effective tax rate in accordance with Sec. 
19.34. The effective tax rate established will be applied to each 
withdrawal or other taxable disposition of the distilled spirits.

<R05>
Sec. 19.24  Persons liable for tax.

    (a) Distilling. 26 U.S.C. 5005 provides that the distiller of 
spirits is liable for the tax and that each proprietor or possessor of, 
and person in any manner interested in the use of, any still, distilling 
apparatus, or distillery, shall be jointly and severally liable for the 
tax on distilled spirits produced. However, a person, not an officer or 
director of a corporate proprietor, owning or having the right of 
control of not more than 10 percent of any class of stock of that 
proprietor, is not liable by reason of the stock ownership or control. 
Persons transferring spirits in bond so liable for the tax are relieved 
of liability if
    (1) The proprietors of transferring and receiving premises are 
independent of each other and neither has a proprietary interest, 
directly or indirectly, in the business of the other, and
    (2) No person so liable for the tax on the spirits transferred 
retains any interest in the spirits.
    (b) Storage on bonded premises. 26 U.S.C. 5005(c) provides that each 
person operating bonded premises shall be liable for the tax on all 
spirits while the spirits are stored on the premises, and on all spirits 
which are in transit to the premises from the time of removal from the 
transferor's bonded premises, pursuant to an approved application. 
Liability for the tax continues until the spirits are transferred or 
withdrawn from bonded premises as authorized by law, or until the 
liability for tax is relieved under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 5008(a). 
Claims for relief from liability for spirits lost are provided for in 
Sec. 19.41. Voluntary destruction of spirits in bond is provided for in 
subpart U of this part.
    (c) Withdrawals without payment of tax. Under 26 U.S.C. 5005(e), any 
person who withdraws spirits from the bonded premises of a plant without 
payment of tax, as provided in 26 U.S.C. 5214, shall be liable for the 
tax on the spirits from the time of withdrawal. The person shall be 
relieved of any liability at the time the spirits are exported, 
deposited in a foreign-trade zone, used in production of wine, deposited 
in a customs bonded warehouse, laden as supplies upon or used in the 
maintenance or repair of certain vessels or aircraft, or used for 
certain research, development or testing, as provided by law.
    (d) Withdrawals free of tax. Persons liable for tax under paragraph 
(a) of this section, are relieved of the liability on spirits withdrawn 
from bonded premises free of tax under this part, at the time the 
spirits are withdrawn.
    (e) Withdrawn from customs custody without payment of tax. 26 U.S.C. 
5232(a) provides that when imported distilled

[[Page 365]]

spirits in bulk containers are withdrawn from customs custody and 
transferred to the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant without 
payment of the tax imposed on imported distilled spirits by 26 U.S.C. 
5001, the person operating the bonded premises of the distilled spirits 
plant to which spirits are transferred shall become liable for the tax 
on the spirits upon their release from customs custody, and the importer 
shall thereupon be relieved of liability for the tax.

determined upon completion of the gauge for determination of tax and 
before withdrawal from bonded premises.

Sec. 19.26  Tax on wine.

    (a) Imposition of tax. A tax is imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5041 or 7652 on 
wine (including imitation, substandard, or artificial wine, and 
compounds sold as wine) produced in or imported or brought into the 
United States. Proprietors of distilled spirits plants may become liable 
for wine taxes under 26 U.S.C. 5362(b)(3) in connection with wine 
transferred in bond to a distilled spirits plant. Wine may not be 
removed from the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant for 
consumption or sale as wine.
    (b) Liability for tax. Except as otherwise provided by law, the 
liability for tax on wine transferred in bond from a bonded wine cellar 
to a distilled spirits plant, or transferred in bond between distilled 
spirits plants, will continue until the wine is used in a distilled 
spirits product.

liable for the tax on the spirits, denatured spirits, or wines fails to 
file a claim for remission as provided in Sec. 19.41(a) or when the 
claim is denied, the tax shall be assessed. In any case where spirits, 
denatured spirits, or wines in bond are removed from bonded premises 
other than as authorized by law, the tax shall be assessed. In the case 
of losses under circumstances described in 26 U.S.C. 5006(b) with 
respect to packages of spirits or denatured spirits on bonded premises, 
the tax shall be assessed if the tax is not paid upon the demand of the 
appropriate TTB officer.

Sec. 19.34  Computation of effective tax rate.

    (a) The proprietor shall compute the effective tax rate for 
distilled spirits containing eligible wine or eligible flavors as the 
ratio of the numerator and denominator as follows:
    (1) The numerator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product 
(exclusive of distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors), 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001;
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5041(b)(1), (2), or 
(3), which would be imposed on the wine but for its removal to bonded 
premises; and
    (iii) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits derived from 
eligible flavors used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate 
prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001, but only to the extent that such distilled 
spirits exceed 2\1/2\% of the denominator prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section.
    (2) The denominator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product, 
including distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors; and
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by twice the percentage of alcohol by volume of each, divided 
by 100.
    (b) In determining the effective tax rate, quantities of distilled 
spirits, eligible wine, and eligible flavors will be expressed to the 
nearest tenth of a proof gallon. The effective tax rate may be rounded 
to as many decimal places as the proprietor deems appropriate, provided 
that, such rate is expressed no less exactly than the rate rounded to 
the nearest whole cent, and the effective tax rates for all products 
will be consistently expressed to the same number of decimal places. In 
such case, if the number is less than five it will be dropped; if it is 
five or over, a unit will be added.
    (c) The following is an example of the use of the formula.

Distilled spirits.........................  2249.1 proof gallons.
Eligible wine (14% alcohol by volume).....  2265.0 wine gallons.

    (a) The proprietor may establish a permanent standard effective tax 
rate for any eligible distilled spirits product based on the least 
quantity and the lowest alcohol content of eligible wine or eligible 
flavors used in the manufacture of the product. The permanent standard 
effective tax rate must equal the highest tax rate applicable to the 
product. The proprietor shall maintain a permanent record of the 
standard effective tax rate established for each product in accordance 
with Sec. 19.765. Whenever the proprietor manufactures a batch of the 
product with a lesser quantity or lower alcohol content of eligible wine 
or eligible flavor, he shall keep the cased goods segregated from other 
completed cases of the same product and shall tax determine the product 
in accordance with Sec. 19.35.
    (b) If the appropriate TTB officer finds that the use of this 
procedure jeopardizes the revenue or causes administrative difficulty,

packaged, in whole or in part, for domestic consumption. At the 
beginning of each month, the proprietor shall recompute the average

month period. The average effective tax rate established for a product 
will be shown in the record of average effective tax rates prescribed in

[[Page 370]]


<R05>
Sec. 19.49  Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart, the following terms have the meanings 
indicated:
    Dealer. A person who sells, or offers for sale, any alcohol product 
(distilled spirits, wines, and/or beer) fit for beverage use.
    Retail dealer in liquors. A dealer who sells, or offers for sale, 
distilled spirits, wines, or beer to any person other than a dealer.
    Wholesale dealer in liquors. A dealer who sells, or offers for sale, 
distilled spirits, wines, or beer to another dealer.

(26 U.S.C. 5121, 5122)


<R05>
Sec. 19.50  Dealer registration.

    Every proprietor who sells or offers for sale any alcoholic product 
(distilled spirits, wines, or beer) fit for beverage use must register 
as a dealer under part 31 of this chapter. However, the proprietor's 
application for registration of a distilled spirits plant filed under 
subpart G of this part, and approval of that application by the 
appropriate TTB officer, will constitute the proprietor's registration 
as a dealer at the distilled spirits plant. Every proprietor registered 
as a dealer under this subpart will be classified as a wholesale dealer 
in liquors (see Sec. 31.32 of this chapter) and as such may also 
operate as a retail dealer in liquors without additional registration. 
Registration covers all sales from the same location, including sales of 
wine, beer, or other proprietors' spirits. A proprietor who conducts 
business as a dealer at a location other than the distilled spirits 
plant must register and keep records in accordance with part 31 of this 
chapter.

(26 U.S.C. 5124)


<R05>
Sec. 19.51  Amending the dealer registration.

    Every proprietor registered as a dealer under this subpart must 
maintain a current and accurate distilled spirits plant registration. 
Whenever there is a change to any of the information provided in the 
proprietor's approved notice of registration, the proprietor must amend 
the registration within the time period specified in subpart G of this 
part. An amendment of the proprietor's distilled spirits plant 
registration will also serve as an amendment of the proprietor's dealer 
registration under this subpart. The proprietor's dealer registration 
will also terminate when distilled spirits plant operations under the 
notice of registration terminate.

(26 U.S.C. 5124)


<R05>
Sec. 19.52  Dealer records.

    Every dealer is required to maintain records of transactions. 
Distilled spirits transactions that appear in the records required by 
subpart W of this part will meet the proprietor's recordkeeping 
requirements as a dealer. For other transactions not covered in the 
distilled spirits plant records, such as retail sales of wine or beer in 
a restaurant at the distilled spirits plant, or operations as a 
wholesale dealer in wine or beer, the proprietor must keep the records 
specified for dealers in part 31 of this chapter.

unfit for beverage use.

    (a) General. Apothecaries, pharmacists, and manufacturers are not

manufacturing or compounding the following products, if the tax has been 
paid or determined on all of the distilled spirits contained therein:
    (1) Medicines, medicinal preparations, food products, flavors, 
flavoring extracts, and perfume, conforming to the standards for 
approval of nonbeverage drawback products found in Sec. Sec. 17.131-
17.137 of this chapter, whether or not drawback is actually claimed on 
those products. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a 
formula need not be submitted if drawback is not desired.

under part 17 of this chapter as being fit for beverage use are 
alcoholic beverages. Bitters, patent medicines, and similar alcoholic 
preparations which are fit for beverage purposes, although held out as 
having certain medicinal properties, are also alcoholic beverages. Such 
products are required to be manufactured on the bonded premises of a 
distilled spirits plant, and are subject to the provisions of this part.
    (c) Formulas and samples; when required. On request of the 
appropriate TTB officer, or when in doubt as to the classification of a 
product, the manufacturer shall submit to the appropriate TTB officer 
the formula for and a sample of the product for examination to verify 
the manufacturer's claim of exemption from qualification requirements.
    (d) Change of formula; when required. If the appropriate TTB officer 
finds at any time that any product manufactured under paragraph (a) of 
this section is being used for beverage purposes, or for mixing with 
beverage spirits other than by a processor, he or she shall notify the 
manufacturer to desist from manufacturing the product until the formula 
is changed to make the product not susceptible of beverage use and the 
change is approved by the appropriate TTB officer. (However, the 
provisions of this paragraph shall not prohibit such products, which are 
unfit for beverage use, from being used in small quantities for 
flavoring drinks at the time of serving for immediate consumption.) 
Where, pursuant to notice, the manufacturer does not desist, or the 
formula is not so modified as to make the product unsusceptible of 
beverage use, the manufacturer shall immediately qualify as a processor.

    The proprietor, on specific approval by the appropriate TTB officer 
as provided in this paragraph, may use an alternate method or procedure 
in lieu of a method or procedure specifically prescribed in this part. 
The appropriate TTB officer may approve an alternate method or 
procedure, subject to stated conditions, when he finds that--
    (a) Good cause has been shown for the use of the alternate method or 
procedure;
    (b) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and

method or procedure, and affords equivalent security to the revenue; and
    (c) The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any 
provision of law, and will not result in an increase in cost to the 
Government or hinder the effective administration of this part. No 
alternate method or procedure relating to the giving of any bond or to

jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is hindered by 
the continuation of such authorization. As used in this paragraph, 
alternate methods or procedures shall include alternate construction or 
equipment.

processes (including spirits produced as a by-product in connection with 
chemical or other processes) are distillers and are required to qualify 
under provisions of 26 U.S.C. Chapter 51 and this part.
    (2) The appropriate TTB officer may, however, waive any provision of 
26 U.S.C. Chapter 51, or of this part, with respect to the production of 
nonpotable chemical mixtures containing spirits, including any provision 
relating to qualification, if such mixtures are produced:
    (i) For transfer to the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant 
for completion of distilling; or
    (ii) As a by-product which would require expensive and complex 
equipment for the recovery of spirits.
    (3) The waiver under the provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section is further conditioned that such mixture would:
    (i) Be destroyed on the premises where produced; or
    (ii) Contain a minimum quantity of spirits practicable with the 
procedure employed, not be subjected to further operations solely for 
the purification or recovery of spirits, and be found by the appropriate 
TTB officer to be as nonpotable and at least as difficult with respect 
to recovery as completely denatured alcohol.
    (b) Application for waiver. (1) When the producer of nonpotable 
mixtures desires to secure a waiver of designated provisions of 26 
U.S.C. Chapter 51, or this part, he shall file an application with the 
appropriate TTB officer.
    (2) The application shall include, as applicable--
    (i) Name and address of producer;
    (ii) Chemical composition and source of the nonpotable mixture;
    (iii) Approximate percentages of chemicals and spirits in the 
mixture;
    (iv) Method of operation proposed;
    (v) Bonded premises where the mixture will be distilled; and
    (vi) Other pertinent information required by the appropriate TTB 
officer.
    (c) Approval. If the appropriate TTB officer finds that the waiver 
of the requirements, or any of them, will not jeopardize the revenue and 
will not unduly hinder supervision of the operations, he may approve the 
application under such terms and conditions as he deems advisable and 
subject to the furnishing of any bond which he deems necessary.

    (c) Will not be contrary to any provisions of law.

Variations from requirements granted under this paragraph are 
conditioned on compliance with the procedures, conditions, and 
limitations with respect thereto set forth in the approval of the 
application. Failure to comply in good faith with such procedures, 
conditions, and limitations shall automatically terminate the authority 
for such variations and the proprietor thereupon shall fully comply with 
the prescribed requirements of regulations from which the variations 
were authorized. Authority for any variation may be withdrawn whenever 
in the judgement of the appropriate TTB officer the revenue is 
jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is hindered by 
the continuation of such variation. Where the proprietor desires to 
employ such variation, he shall submit a written application to do so to 
the appropriate TTB officer. The application shall describe the proposed 
variations and set forth the reasons therefor. Variations shall not be 
employed until the application has been approved.

that spirits stored are subject to great loss or wastage, he may require 
the discontinuance of the use of such facilities and require the spirits 
contained therein to be transferred to such other storage facilities as 
he may designate. Such transfer shall be made at such time and under 
such supervision as the appropriate TTB officer may require and the 
expense of the transfer shall be paid by the owner or the warehouseman 
of the spirits. Whenever the owner of such spirits or the warehouseman 
fails to make such transfer within the time prescribed or to pay the 
just and proper expense of such transfer, as ascertained and determined 
by the appropriate TTB officer, such spirits may be seized and sold in 
the same manner as goods sold on distraint for taxes, and the proceeds 
of such sale shall be applied to the payment of the taxes due thereon

Sec. 19.91  Gauging.

    (a) Gauging of spirits and wine. Gauges shall be made by the 
proprietor. However, the appropriate TTB officer may require that such 
gauges be made in the presence of and be verified by an appropriate TTB 
officer. Gauges of spirits, denatured spirits, or wine shall be made in 
accordance with 27 CFR part 30 and as provided in this part. However, 
the gauge for wine that is to be transferred to a bonded wine cellar 
shall be recorded by kind and percent of alcohol by volume. When bulk 
spirits, denatured spirits, or wines are to be volumetrically measured, 
the measurement shall be in a tank or bulk conveyance for which a 
calibration chart is provided, by a meter approved under Sec. 19.277, 
or, when approved by the appropriate TTB officer, by other devices or 
methods. Calibration charts shall be

[[Page 378]]

certified as accurate by persons qualified to calibrate tanks or bulk 
conveyances. When spirits in bottles are gauged, the gauge may be 
established on the basis of legible case markings and label information, 
if (1) the bottles are full, and (2) there is no evidence that the 
bottles have been tampered with.
    (b) Gauging of alcoholic flavoring materials. Each alcoholic 
flavoring material shall be gauged when dumped, except that when 
received from a manufacturer in a closed nonporous bottle, can, or 
package such material may be gauged by using the proof derived from the 
container label or a related statement of the proof from the 
manufacturer. When proof is determined from a label or manufacturer's 
statement, the proprietor shall periodically test a sufficient number of 
samples of the alcoholic flavoring material to verify the accuracy of 
the proof so determined and shall record the results of those tests on 
the gauge record. The appropriate TTB officer may require that all 
alcoholic flavoring materials be gauged by the methods provided in 27 
CFR part 30.

to be conducted at a bonded warehouse established with less than the 
minimum storage requirements.
    (d) Special condition. The proprietor of a warehouse established for

                  Operations by Alternating Proprietors


<R05>
Sec. 19.201  Procedure for alternating proprietors.

    (a) General. A plant, or any part thereof which is suitable for 
qualification as a separate plant, may be operated alternately by 
proprietors who have filed and received approval of the necessary bonds 
and applications for registration, and have otherwise qualified under 
the provisions of this subpart. Where operations by alternating 
proprietors are limited to parts of the plant, the notice of 
registration shall describe the areas, rooms or buildings or combination 
thereof, which will be alternated, and shall be accompanied by special 
diagrams designating the parts of the plant which are to be alternated. 
A special diagram shall be submitted for each arrangement under which 
the premises will be operated. Once such qualifying documents have been 
approved, and initial operations have been conducted thereunder, the 
plant, or parts thereof, may be alternated by the proprietor filing 
notices on Form 5110.34 with the appropriate TTB officer. Any transfer 
of spirits, idenatured spirits, and wines shall be indicated on Form 
5110.34 filed by each proprietor.
    (b) Production. Distilling materials and unfinished spirits in any 
bonded areas, rooms or buildings to be alternated shall be processed to 
completion by the outgoing proprietor unless transferred to the incoming 
proprietor. All finished spirits shall be marked and removed by the 
outgoing proprietor in the name in which produced, before production 
gauge is made of any spirits by the incoming proprietor.
    (c) Storage. Spirits and wines in any bonded areas, rooms, or 
buildings to be alternated shall be transferred in bond to the incoming 
proprietor. The outgoing proprietor shall execute a consent of surety on 
Form 1533 (5000.18) to continue in effect the operations or unit bond 
whenever operation of the areas, rooms, or buildings is to be resumed by 
him following suspension of operations by an alternate proprietor.
    (d) Processing. Spirits, denatured spirits, wines and articles in 
any rooms, areas, or buildings to be alternated shall be processed to 
completion and removed from the affected areas, rooms, or buildings by 
the outgoing proprietor prior to the effective date and hours given in 
the notice unless transferred or retained in locked tanks as provided in 
this paragraph. Spirits, denatured spirits, and wines may be transferred 
to the incoming proprietor. Further, the outgoing proprietor shall 
execute a consent of surety on Form 1533 (5000.18) to continue in effect 
the operations or unit bond whenever operation of the affected areas, 
rooms, or buildings is to be resumed by him following suspension of 
operations by the alternate proprietor. Denatured spirits and articles 
may be retained in tanks locked by approved locks, the keys to which are 
in the custody of the outgoing proprietor. In this case, the outgoing 
proprietor shall execute a consent of surety on Form 1533 (5000.18) to 
continue liability on the operations or unit bond for the tax on such 
denatured spirits or articles retained in such tanks, notwithstanding 
the change in proprietorship.
    (e) Records. Each proprietor shall maintain separate records and 
submit separate reports. Records kept by the outgoing proprietor for 
spirits, wines, and alcoholic flavoring materials may be used by the 
incoming proprietor. All transfers of distilling materials, unfinished 
spirits, spirits, denatured spirits, and wines shall be reflected in the 
records of each proprietor.

temporarily by customs officers, under applicable customs law and 
regulations, for the purpose of gauging or processing distilled spirits. 
The use of the excluded portion of the premises for customs purposes is 
subject to the approval of the district director of customs. When it is 
necessary to convey spirits in customs custody across the premises of a 
distilled spirits plant, the proprietor shall comply with the provisions 
of Sec. 19.99. When a portion of the distilled spirits plant premises 
is first to be excluded as provided in this section, the proprietor

such qualifying documents have been approved by the appropriate TTB 
officer, the designated premises and equipment may be alternately 
curtailed or extended pursuant to notice on Form 5110.34. Portions of 
the premises to be excluded by curtailment or included by extension 
shall not be used for purposes other than as set forth in the current

be excluded from the distilled spirits plant premises as provided in 
this section shall be separated from the remaining portion of the 
distilled spirits plant premises in a manner which satisfies the 
appropriate TTB officer that the revenue will not be jeopardized.
    (c) Exception. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section, the bonded premises may be used temporarily without 
filing Form 5110.41 or Form 5110.34, for the sole purpose of gauging 
bulk distilled spirits to effect their transfer from customs custody to 
TTB bond.

premises from bonded wine cellar premises after alternation shall be in 
a manner which satisfies the appropriate TTB officer that the revenue 
will not be jeopardized.

    (1) Such distilled spirits plant is qualified under subpart G for 
the production of distilled spirits; and
    (2) Such wine cellar and distilled spirits plant are operated by the 
same person (or in the case of a corporation, by such corporation and

of such plants, and any bonded wine cellars which are adjacent to such 
plants and which otherwise could be covered by an operations bond. For 
the purpose of this section, a controlled subsidiary is a corporation 
where more than 50 percent of the voting power is controlled by the 
parent corporation. Bonds given under this section shall be in lieu of 
the bonds which would be required under Sec. 19.245(a) and shall 
contain the terms and conditions of such bonds. If the area operations 
bond covers the operations of more than one corporation, each

within a region and who intends to withdraw spirits from bond on 
determination, but before payment, of the tax shall, before making any 
such withdrawal, furnish a withdrawal bond to secure payment of the tax 
on all spirits so withdrawn. Such bond shall be in addition to the 
operations bond, and if the distilled spirits are withdrawn under the 
withdrawal bond, the operations bond shall no longer cover liability for 
payment of the tax on the spirits withdrawn. For the purpose of this 
section, a controlled subsidiary is a corporation where more than 50 
percent of the voting power is controlled by the parent corporation. The 
bond, if it covers more than one plant, shall show as to each plant 
covered by the bond the part of the total sum which represents the penal 
sum (computed in accordance with Sec. 19.245) for each such plant. If 
the penal sum of the bond covering a plant, or the penal sum allocated 
to any plant (where the bond covers more than one plant), is in an 
amount less than the maximum prescribed in Sec. 19.245, withdrawals 
from such plant shall not exceed the quantity permissible, as reflected 
by the penal sum in the bond for such plant. Such withdrawal bond shall 
be conditioned that the total amount of the bond shall be available for 
satisfaction of any liability incurred under the terms and conditions of 
such bond.

    Any person (or, in the case of a corporation, a corporation and its 
controlled subsidiaries) who would otherwise be required to give bonds 
for both operations at one or more distilled spirits plants (and any 
adjacent bonded wine cellars) and withdrawals from one or more distilled 
spirits plants within a reigon may, in lieu of furnishing separate bonds 
for operations and withdrawals, furnish a unit bond containing the terms 
and conditions of the bonds

[[Page 397]]

in lieu of which it is given. For the purpose of this section, a 
controlled subsidiary is a corporation where more than 50 percent of the 
voting power is controlled by the parent corporation. The unit bond 
shall show as to each plant covered by the bond the part of the total 
sum which represents the penal sum (computed in accordance with Sec. 
19.245) for operations at and withdrawals from each plant. If the penal 
sum of the bond covering a plant, or the penal sum allocated to any 
plant (if the bond covers more than one plant), is in an amount less 
than the maximum prescribed in Sec. 19.245, operations at and/or 
withdrawals from such plant shall not exceed the quantity permissible as 
reflected by the penal sum in the bond for such plant. The unit bond 
shall be conditioned that the total amount of the bond shall be 
available for satisfaction of any liability incurred under the terms and 
conditions of such bond.

Sec. 19.312  Receipt of materials.

    The quantities of fermenting and distilling materials (including 
nonpotable chemical mixtures containing spirits produced in accordance 
with Sec. 19.67), and of spirits, denatured spirits, articles, and 
spirits residues, for redistillation, received on bonded premises shall 
be determined by the proprietor, and reported as provided in subpart W 
of this part. Fermented material (except apple cider exempt from tax 
under 26 U.S.C. 5042(a)(1)) to be used in the production of spirits 
shall be produced on the bonded premises where used or must be received 
on the premises from (a) a bonded wine cellar, in the case of wine, or 
(b) a contiguous brewery where produced, in the case of beer.

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1356, as amended, 1365, as amended 
(26 U.S.C. 5201, 5222, 5223))


<R05>
Sec. 19.313  Use of materials in production of spirits.

    The proprietor may produce spirits from any suitable material in 
accordance with statements of production procedure in his notice of 
registration. The distillation of nonpotable chemical mixtures received 
pursuant to application as provided in Sec. 19.67 shall be deemed to be 
the original and continuous distillation of the spirits in such mixtures 
and to constitute the production of spirits. Materials from which 
alcohol will not be produced may be used in production only if the use 
of the materials is described in approved statements of production 
procedure.

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1349, as amended, 1353, as amended 
(26 U.S.C. 5172, 5178))


<R05>
Sec. 19.314  Removal of fermenting material.

    Material received for use as fermenting material may be removed from

<R05>
Sec. 19.315  Removal or destruction of distilling material.

    Except as provided in this section, distilling material shall not be 
removed from bonded premises before being distilled. The proprietor may 
remove mash, wort, wash or other distilling material--(a) to plant 
premises, other than bonded premises for use in such businesses as may 
be authorized under Sec. 19.72; (b) to other premises for use in 
processes not involving the production of (1) spirits, (2) alcoholic 
beverages, or (3) vinegar by the vaporizing process; or (c) for 
destruction. The residue of distilling material not introduced into the 
production system may be removed from the premises if the liquid is 
expressed from the material before removal and such liquid is not 
received at any distilled spirits plant or bonded wine cellar. Residue 
of beer used as distilling material may be returned to the producing 
brewery. Distilling material produced and wine and beer received for use 
as distilling material may be destroyed. A record of removal or 
destruction shall be kept as provided in subpart W of this part.

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1365, as amended, 1381, as amended

<R05>
Sec. 19.316  Distillation.

    The distillation of spirits shall be such that the spirits pass 
through a continuous system from the first still or other production 
equipment where access to the system would constitute

[[Page 405]]

a jeopardy to the revenue until the production of the spirits is 
completed. The distiller may, in the course of production, convey the 
product through as many distilling or other production operations as 
desired, provided the operations are continuous. Distilling operations 
are continuous when the spirits are conveyed through the various steps 
of production as expeditiously as plant operation will permit. The 
collection of unfinished spirits for the purpose of redistillation is 
not deemed to be a break in the continuity of the distilling procedure. 
However, the quantity and proof of any unfinished spirits produced from 
distilling materials, the quantity of which was ascertained in the 
manner authorized in Sec. 19.732(c) for such materials, shall be 
determined and recorded before any mingling with other materials or 
before any further operations involving the unfinished spirits outside 
the continuous system. Spirits may be held, prior to the production 
gauge, only for so long as is reasonably necessary to complete the 
production procedure.

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1353, as amended, 1362, as amended,

<R05>
Sec. 19.317  Treatment during production.

    Spirits may, in the course of original and continuous distillation, 
be purified or refined through, or by use of, any material which will 
not remain incorporated in the finished product. Juniper berries and 
other natural aromatics, or the extracted oils of such, may be used in 
the distillation of gin. Spirits may be percolated through or treated 
with oak chips which have not been treated with any chemical. Materials 
used in treatment of spirits, and which do not remain in the spirits, 
shall be destroyed or so treated as to preclude the extraction of 
potable spirits therefrom.

<R05>
Sec. 19.318  Addition of caramel to rum or brandy and addition of oak
chips to spirits.

    Caramel possessing no material sweetening properties may be added to 
rum or brandy on bonded premises prior to production gauge. Oak chips 
which have not been treated with any chemical may be added to packages 
prior to or after production gauge; however, notation to that effect 
shall be made on the record of production gauge as provided in Sec. 
19.319.

<R05>
Sec. 19.319  Production gauge.

    (a) General. All spirits shall be gauged by determining quantity and 
proof within a reasonable time after production is completed. Except as 
otherwise specifically provided in this section, quantities may be 
determined by volume or by weight, by approved meter, or, when approved 
by the appropriate TTB officer, by other devices or methods which 
accurately determine the quantities. If caramel is added to brandy or 
rum, the proof of the spirits shall be determined after the addition. 
Spirits in each receiving tank shall be gauged before reduction in proof 
and both before and after each removal of spirits therefrom. The gauges 
shall be recorded by the proprietor in the records required by Sec. 
19.736.
    (b) Tax to be determined on production gauge. Tax may be determined 
on the basis of the production gauge if:
    (1) Spirits are weighed into bulk conveyances;
    (2) Spirits are uniformly filled by weight into metal packages; or
    (3) Spirits are filled by weight into packages for immediate 
withdrawal from bonded premises and the details of the gauge for each 
package are recorded on a package gauge record according to Sec. 
19.769.

Transaction records shall be marked ``Withdrawal on Production Gauge.''
    (c) Tax not to be determined on production gauge. If spirits are 
drawn from the production system into barrels, drums, or similar 
portable containers of the same rated capacity and the containers are 
filled to capacity, and the tax is not to be determined on the basis of 
the production gauge, the gauge may be made by:
    (1) Weighing in a tank, converting the weight into proof gallons, 
and determining the average content of each container; or
    (2) Measuring volumetrically, in a calibrated tank, converting the 
wine

[[Page 406]]

gallons determined into proof gallons, and determining therefrom the 
average content of each container; or
    (3) Converting the rated capacity into proof gallons to determine 
the average content of each container; or
    (4) Determining by a device or method approved under the provisions 
of paragraph (a) of this section, the total quantity filled into 
containers, and determining therefrom the average content of each 
container. Rated capacity of new cooperage shall be as prescribed by 
specifications of the manufacturer, or in the case of used cooperage, as 
determined by the proprietor.
    (d) Records of production gauge. In computing the production gauge 
on the basis of average content of packages as provided in paragraph (c) 
of this section, fractional proof gallons shall be rounded to the 
nearest one-tenth and the average content so determined and the number 
of packages filled shall be used in computing the quantity produced. A 
separate gauge record, as prescribed in Sec. 19.768, shall be prepared 
for each lot of packages filled (see Sec. 19.593(b)) and for each 
removal by pipeline or bulk conveyance for deposit in bond on the same 
plant premises. The gauge record shall indicate ``Deposit in storage'' 
or ``Deposit in processing.'' If spirits are to be transferred in bond, 
or withdrawn from bond, as authorized by this part, the production gauge 
shall be made on the form or record required by this part for the 
transaction (accompanied by a package gauge record, if required). Each 
transaction form or record and each package gauge record, if any, shall 
show:
    (1) The real name (or basic operating name as provided in Sec. 
19.280) of the producer, and, if the spirits are produced under a trade 
name, the trade name under which produced.
    (2) For each remnant container, the actual proof gallons in the 
container.

<R05>
Sec. 19.320  Identification of spirits.

    At the time of production gauge, containers of spirits shall be 
identified by the proprietor in accordance with subpart R of this part. 
When the proprietor desires to enter spirits into bonded storage for 
subsequent packaging in wooden packages, he may identify such spirits 
with the specific designation to which they would be entitled if drawn 
into wooden packages, followed by the word ``Designate,'' for example, 
``Bourbon Whisky Designate.''

<R05>
Sec. 19.321  Entry.

    Pursuant to the production gauge, the proprietor shall make 
appropriate entry for (a) deposit of the spirits on bonded premises for 
storage or processing, (b) withdrawal of the spirits on determination of 
tax, (c) withdrawal of the spirits free of tax, (d) withdrawal of the 
spirits without payment of tax, or (e) transfer of the spirits for 
redistillation. Entry for deposit on the bonded premises of the same 
plant premises shall be made on a gauge record, prepared according to 
Sec. 19.768. When spirits are entered for deposit on another plant 
premises or are entered for withdrawal or redistillation, the applicable 
provisions of subpart K or subpart P of this part shall be followed.

    (a) General. (1) At representative intervals during bottling 
operations, proprietors shall test and examine bottled spirits to 
determine whether those spirits agree in alcohol content and quantity 
(fill) with that stated on the label or bottle.
    (2) If the appropriate TTB officer finds that a proprietor's test

bottled product, the appropriate TTB officer may require corrective 
measures.
    (b) Variations in alcohol content and fill. The proprietor shall 
rebottle, recondition, or relabel spirits if the bottle contents do not 
agree with the respective data on the label or bottle as to:
    (1) Quantity (fill), except for such variation as may occur in 
filling conducted in compliance with good commercial practice with an 
overall objective of maintaining 100 percent fill for spirits bottled; 
and/or
    (2) Alcohol content, subject to a normal drop in alcohol content 
which may occur during bottling operations not to exceed:
    (i) 0.25 percent alcohol by volume for products containing solids in 
excess of 600 mg per 100 ml, or
    (ii) 0.25 percent alcohol by volume for all spirits products bottled 
in 50 or 100 ml size bottles, or
    (iii) 0.15 percent alcohol by volume for all other spirits and 
bottle sizes.

For example, a product with a solids content of less than 600 mg per 100 
ml, labeled as containing 40 percent alcohol by volume and bottled in a 
750 ml bottle, would be acceptable if the test for alcohol content found 
that it contained 39.85 percent alcohol by volume.
    (c) Records. Proprietors shall record the results of all tests of 
alcohol content and quantity (fill) in the record required by Sec. 
19.750.

may desire if it is not inconsistent with the required information. The 
label information may be stated in the language of the country to which 
the spirits are to be exported provided the proprietor maintains on file 
an English translation of the information. The net contents and proof 
may be stated in the units of measurement of the foreign country 
provided the proprietor maintains a record of the equivalent units as 
they would be required to be expressed if bottled for domestic 
consumption. The appropriate TTB officer may waive the requirement of 
showing any of the information required by this section, other than the 
kind of spirits, upon a showing that the country to which the spirits 
are to be exported prohibits the showing of such information. With 
respect to kind of spirits, the appropriate TTB officer may waive the 
designation required by 27 CFR 5.22, only to the extent that the label

Sec. 19.508  Consignor premises.

    (a) General. (1) A transfer record shall be prepared according to 
Sec. 19.770 by (i) the consignor proprietor of a distilled spirits 
plant (A) to cover the transfer of spirits or denatured spirits in bond 
to another distilled spirits plant, pursuant to an approved application 
on Form 5100.16, (B) to cover the transfer in bond of spirits or 
denatured spirits to an alcohol fuel plant, or (C) to cover the transfer 
of wine in bond to the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant or 
bonded wine cellar; or (ii) the consignor proprietor of an alcohol fuel 
plant to cover the transfer of spirits to the bonded premises of a 
distilled spirits plant pursuant to an approved application on Form 
5100.16. Except as otherwise provided herein, a transfer record shall be 
prepared for each conveyance. The proprietor shall also enter on the 
transfer record the serial numbers of any seals or other devices affixed 
to a conveyance used for shipment of spirits, or denatured spirits. On 
completion of lading (or completion of transfer by pipeline), the 
proprietor shall retain one copy of the transfer record and one copy of 
any accompanying document for his files and forward the original of the 
transfer record and any accompanying document to the consignee (to 
accompany the shipment, if by truck).
    (2) Spirits or denatured spirits produced from petroleum, natural 
gas, or coal may not be transferred to alcohol fuel plants qualified 
under 26 U.S.C. 5181.
    (3) The consignor proprietor may cover on one transfer record all 
packages of spirits shipped by truck on the same day from his bonded 
premises to the bonded premises of another plant. In such case, the 
proprietor shall prepare a shipment and delivery order for each 
shipment, showing the number of packages, their package identification 
or serial numbers, the name of the producer, warehouseman, or processor, 
and the serial numbers of the seals or other devices (if any) applied to 
the truck. Such shipping and delivery order shall be properly 
authenticated and shall consititute a complete record of the spirits so 
transferred in each truck each day. A copy of each shipping and delivery 
order shall be retained by the consignor. On completion of the lading of 
the last truck for the day, the proprietor shall retain one copy of the 
transfer record and one copy of any accompanying document for his files 
and forward the original of the transfer record and any accompanying 
document to the consignee.
    (b) Packages. When spirits are to be transferred in bond in 
packages, the consignor proprietor shall weigh each package, except (1) 
when the transfer is to be made in a secured conveyance, (2) when the 
individual packages have been securely sealed by the proprietor, or (3) 
when this requirement has been waived by the appropriate TTB officer on 
a finding that, because of the location of the premises and the proposed 
method of operation, there will be no jeopardy to the revenue. When 
packages are weighed at the time of shipment, the proprietor shall 
assign temporary serial numbers to the packages and show for each 
package its gross shipment weight on a package gauge record prepared 
according to Sec. 19.769. A copy of the package gauge record shall 
accompany each copy of the transfer record.
    (c) Bulk conveyances and pipelines. When spirits, denatured spirits, 
or wines are to be transferred in bond in bulk conveyances or by 
pipelines, the consignor shall gauge the spirits, denatured spirits, or 
wines and record the quantity so determined on the transfer record 
prescribed in Sec. 19.770. Bulk conveyances of spirits or denatured 
spirits shall be secured by the proprietor.

<R05>
Sec. 19.509  Reconsignment.

    Where, prior to or on arrival at the premises of a consignee, 
spirits, denatured spirits, or wines transferred in bond are found to be 
unsuitable for the purpose for which intended, were shipped in error, 
or, for any other bona fide reason, are not accepted by such consignee, 
or are not accepted by a carrier, they may be reconsigned, by the 
consignor, to himself, or to another consignee. In such case, 
application to receive spirits or denatured spirits by transfer in bond 
(on Form 5100.16) shall have been previously approved for the consignee 
(not required in the case of wines or in the case of alcohol fuel plants 
receiving spirits or denatured spirits) and the bond of the proprietor 
to whom the spirits, denatured spirits, or wines are reconsigned shall 
cover such spirits, denatured spirits, or wines while in transit after 
reconsignment. Notice of cancellation of the shipment shall be made by 
the consignor to the consignee. Where the reconsignment is to another 
proprietor, a new transfer record shall be prepared and prominently 
marked with the word ``Reconsignment''.

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1367, as amended, 1380, as amended

<R05>
Sec. 19.510  Consignee premises.

    (a) General. When spirits, denatured spirits, or wines are received 
by transfer in bond, the consignee proprietor shall examine each 
conveyance to determine whether the securing devices, if any, are intact 
upon arrival at his premises. If the securing devices are not intact, he 
shall immediately notify the appropriate TTB officer before removal of 
any spirits from the conveyance. The proprietor shall follow the 
provisions of subpart Q of this part to determine, record, and report 
losses, if any. After execution on the transfer record as prescribed in 
Sec. 19.770 or Form 703, as appropriate, of his receipt of the shipment 
of spirits, denatured spirits, or wines, the consignee shall retain the 
original of the transfer record and any accompanying documents for his 
files, or dispose of Form 703 (in the case of wines from a bonded wine 
cellar), as provided in the instructions on the form. Retained copies of 
transfer records and Forms 703 shall become deposit records. Spirits 
which are produced at alcohol fuel plants shall be separately identified 
and accounted for as for fuel use, and may not be withdrawn, used, sold 
or otherwise disposed of for other than fuel use.
    (b) Packages. When spirits are received in packages, the consignee 
proprietor shall weigh each package, except: (1) when the transfer is 
made in a secured conveyance and the securing devices are intact on 
arrival, (2) when the individual packages have been sealed by the 
consignor proprietor and are intact on arrival, or (3) when the 
requirement for weighing the packages at the consignor premises has been 
waived under the provisions of Sec. 19.508(b)(3). The proprietor shall 
record the receiving weight of each package on the accompanying package 
gauge record or on a list with temporary package serial numbers prepared 
by the consignor. A copy of such package gauge record or list shall 
remain with the original of the transfer record.
    (c) Bulk conveyances and pipelines. When spirits, denatured spirits, 
or wines are received in bulk conveyances or by pipeline, the consignee 
shall gauge the spirits, denatured spirits, or wines and record the 
gauge on the transfer record prescribed in Sec. 19.770 or, in the case 
of wines received from a bonded wine cellar, on Form 703. The consignee 
shall ensure that each conveyance emptied has been thoroughly drained. 
The appropriate TTB officer may waive the requirement for gauging 
spirits, denatured spirits, or wines on receipt by pipeline if he finds 
that because of the location of the premises, there will be no jeopardy 
to the revenue.

<R05>
Sec. 19.515  Determination and payment of tax.

    (a) General. Distilled spirits may be withdrawn from bonded premises 
on determination of tax in approved containers, or, to the contiguous 
premises of a manufacturer of nonbeverage products, by pipeline. All tax 
which is to be prepaid or deferred shall be determined prior to the 
physical removal of the spirits from bonded premises. The proprietor 
shall record the results of each tax determination on a record of tax 
determination as required by Sec. 19.761.
    (b) Payment of tax. The tax on the spirits shall be prepaid on Form 
5000.24 before removal of the spirits from bonded premises unless the 
proprietor has furnished a withdrawal or unit bond to secure payment of 
the tax. Where such bond is in less than the maximum penal sum, the 
proprietor shall prepay the tax for any withdrawal which would cause the 
outstanding liability for tax to exceed the limits of coverage under the 
bond.

of his bond and he shall charge the bond with the amount of liability 
incurred on each withdrawal on determination of tax. He shall credit the 
bond on payment of the amount of tax required to be remitted with a 
return and by authorized credits taken on a return. Where a bond in less 
than the maximum penal sum has been allocated among two or more plants, 
as provided in Sec. Sec. 19.243 and 19.244, the proprietor shall 
maintain an account at each plant of that part of the penal sum 
allocated to that plant.

Sec. 19.517  Gauge for tax determination.

    (a) Packages. When spirits in packages are to be withdrawn from 
bonded premises on determination of tax on the basis of an individual 
package gauge, each package shall be gauged unless the tax is to be 
determined on the production or filling gauge. When packages are gauged, 
the proprietor shall prepare a package gauge record, according to Sec. 
19.769, and attach it to the record of tax determination prescribed in 
Sec. 19.761.
    (b) Tanks. Spirits in tanks which are to be withdrawn on 
determination of tax shall be gauged (by weighing and proofing) as 
prescribed in Sec. 19.93, and the elements of the gauge shall be 
recorded on the record of tax determination or on a separate record of 
the gauge for attachment to the record of tax determination.
    (c) Cases. Cases of distilled spirits to be withdrawn from bonded 
premises shall be tax determined on the basis of the contents thereof. 
The proof gallonage contained in cases shall be determined in accordance 
with 27 CFR part 30 and the method prescribed in Sec. 19.722.

Sec. 19.518  Imported spirits.

    When spirits which have been imported for nonbeverage purposes and 
transferred to bonded premises pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 5232 are withdrawn 
for beverage purposes, there shall be paid, in addition to the internal 
revenue tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5001, a tax equal to the duty which 
would have been paid had the spirits been imported for beverage 
purposes, less the duty already paid thereon. The additional tax shall 
be referred to as ``additional tax--less duty'', and shall be paid at 
the time and in the manner that the basic tax is paid. The total 
quantity in proof gallons withdrawn shall be the basis of computing the 
tax at the rates indicated. The amount of the ``additional tax--less 
duty'' shall be stated separately and identified as such on the tax 
return.

return and may be in any form which the appropriate TTB officer is 
authorized to accept under the provisions of Sec. 70.61 (Payment by 
check or money order) and which is acceptable to him. However, where a 
check or money order tendered in payment for taxes is not paid on 
presentment, or where the taxpayer is otherwise in default in payment, 
any remittance made during the period of such default, and until the 
appropriate TTB officer finds that the revenue will not be jeopardized 
by the acceptance of a personal check (if acceptable to the appropriate 
TTB officer), shall be in cash or in the form of a certified, cashier's, 
or treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust company incorporated 
under the laws of the United States, or under the laws of any State, 
Territory, or possession of the United States, or a money order, as 
provided in Sec. 70.61. Checks and money orders shall be made payable

<R05>
Sec. 19.522  Taxes to be collected by returns.

    (a)(1) Deferred payment of taxes. The tax on spirits to be withdrawn 
from bond for deferred payment of tax shall be paid pursuant to a return 
on Form 5000.24, Excise Tax Return. The return, Form 5000.24, shall be 
executed and filed for each return period notwithstanding that no tax is 
due for payment for such period. The proprietor of each bonded premises 
shall include, for payment, on his return on Form 5000.24, the full 
amount of distilled spirits tax determined in respect of all spirits 
released for withdrawal from

[[Page 427]]

the bonded premises on determination of tax during the period covered by 
the return (except spirits on which tax has been prepaid).
    (2) Return periods--(i) Definitions. For purposes of this section, 
the following terms have the meanings indicated:
    Reasonably expects. When used with reference to a taxpayer, 
reasonably expects means the taxpayer was not liable for more than 
$50,000 in taxes the previous year and there is no other existing or 
anticipated circumstance known to the taxpayer (such as an increase in 
production capacity) that would cause the taxpayer's liability to 
increase beyond that limit.
    Taxpayer. A taxpayer is a person who is liable for excise tax 
imposed with respect to distilled spirits by 26 U.S.C. 5001 and 7652 
under the same Employer Identification Number as defined in 26 CFR 
301.7701-12.
    (ii) Semimonthly return period. Except in the case of a taxpayer who 
qualifies for, and chooses to use, quarterly return periods as provided 
in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, all taxpayers must use semimonthly 
return periods for deferred payment of tax. The semimonthly return 
periods shall run from the 1st day through the 15th day of each month, 
and from the 16th day through the last day of each month, except as 
otherwise provided in Sec. 19.523(c).
    (iii) Quarterly return period. Effective January 1, 2006, a taxpayer 
who reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $50,000 in taxes 
with respect to distilled spirits imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5001 and 7652 for 
the current calendar year, and who was liable for not more than $50,000 
in such taxes in the preceding calendar year, may choose to use a 
quarterly return period. In such a case the last day for payment of tax 
and filing of the return will be the 14th day after the last day of the 
calendar quarter. However, the taxpayer may not use the quarterly return 
period procedure for any portion of the calendar year following the 
first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the taxpayer 
during the calendar year exceeds $50,000, and any tax which has not been 
paid on that date will be due on the 14th day after the last day of the 
semimonthly period in which that date occurs.
    (b) Conditions under which deferral is denied. Notwithstanding the 
posting of a withdrawal or unit bond by the proprietor, the tax shall be 
prepaid as provided in paragraph (c) of this section--
    (1) Where a proprietor has defaulted in any payment of tax under 
this section, during the period of such default and until the 
appropriate TTB officer finds that the revenue will not be jeopardized 
by deferral; or
    (2) Where a proprietor, who, after having been notified of his 
deficiency by the appropriate TTB officer (i) fails to maintain records 
required by this part to substantiate the correctness of his tax returns 
or (ii) otherwise fails to comply with any provisions of this part, is 
so notified by the appropriate TTB officer.
    (c) Prepaid taxes. The tax on distilled spirits shall be paid 
pursuant to a prepayment return on Form 5000.24 in all cases where the 
tax is required to be paid before the spirits are withdrawn from bond. A 
single prepayment return on Form 5000.24 may cover one or more 
transactions. The proprietor shall note the serial number of the Form 
5000.24 and the date and time such prepayment return was filed on the 
individual record of tax determination.

    (b) Payment pursuant to prepayment return. If the proprietor of a 
distilled spirits plant desires to withdraw spirits from bonded premises 
on determination of tax and does not have on file an approved withdrawal 
or unit bond of sufficient penal sum to cover the withdrawal, if there 
is default by him in any payment of tax under this part, or the 
proprietor is notified by the appropriate TTB officer as provided in 
Sec. 19.522(b)(2), the proprietor shall not remove the spirits from the 
bonded premises until the tax thereon has been paid. To pay the tax, the 
proprietor of the bonded premises shall file a prepayment return on Form 
5000.24, and remittance as required by Sec. 19.524 or Sec. 19.525, 
before removal of the spirits.
    (c) Special rule for taxes due for the month of September (effective 
after December 31, 1994). (1)(i) Except as provided in paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii) of this section, the second semimonthly period for the month 
of September shall be divided into two payment periods, from the 16th 
day through the 26th day, and from the 27th day through the 30th day. 
The proprietor shall file a return on Form 5000.24, and make remittance, 
for the period September 16-26, no later than September 29. The 
proprietor shall file a return on Form 5000.24, and make remittance, for 
the period September 27-30, no later than October 14.
    (ii) Taxpayment not by electronic fund transfer. In the case of 
taxes not required to be remitted by electronic fund transfer as 
prescribed by Sec. 19.524, the second semimonthly period of September 
shall be divided into two payment periods, from the 16th day through the 
25th day, and the 26th day through the 30th day. The proprietor shall 
file a return on Form 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period

26-30, no later than October 14.
    (2) Amount of payment: Safe harbor rule. (i) Taxpayers are 
considered to have met the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section, if the amount paid no later than September 29 is not less than 
\11/15\ (73.3 percent) of the tax liability incurred for the semimonthly 
period beginning on September 1 and ending on September 15, and if any 
underpayment of tax is paid by October 14.
    (ii) Taxpayers are considered to have met the requirements of 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, if the amount paid no later than 
September 28 is not less than 2/3rds (66.7 percent) of the tax liability 
incurred for the semimonthly period beginning on September 1 and ending 
on September 15, and if any underpayment of tax is paid by October 14.
    (3) Last day for payment. If the required taxpayment due date for 
the periods September 16-25 or September 16-26 as applicable, falls on a 
Saturday or legal holiday, the return and remittance shall be due on the 
immediately preceding day. If the required due date falls on a Sunday, 
the return and remittance shall be due on the immediately following day.
    (4) Example. Payment of tax for the month of September. (i) Facts. 
X, a distilled spirits plant proprietor required to pay taxes by 
electronic fund transfer, incurred tax liability in the amount of 
$30,000 for the first semimonthly period of September. For the period 
September 16-26, X incurred tax liability in the amount of $45,000, and 
for the period September 27-30, X incurred tax liability in the amount 
of $2,000.
    (ii) Payment requirement. X's payment of tax in the amount of 
$30,000 for the first semimonthly period of September is due no later 
than September 29 (Sec. 19.522(a)). X's payment of tax for the period 
September 16-26 is also due no later than September 29 (Sec. 
19.523(c)(1)(i)). X may use the safe harbor rule to determine the amount 
of payment due for the period of September 16-26 (Sec. 19.523(c)(2)). 
Under the safe harbor rule, X's payment of tax must equal $21,990.00, 
11/15ths of the tax liability incurred during the first semimonthly 
period of September. Additionally, X's payment of tax in the amount of 
$2,000 for the period September 27-30 must be paid no later than October 
14 (Sec. 19.523(c)(1)(i)). X must also pay the underpayment of tax,

[[Page 429]]

for the period September 16-26, no later than October 14 (Sec. 
19.523(c)(2)).
    (d) Payment pursuant to quarterly return. Where the proprietor of 
bonded premises has withdrawn spirits from such premises on 
determination and before payment of tax, and the proprietor uses 
quarterly return periods as provided in Sec. 19.522(b)(3), the 
proprietor shall file a quarterly tax return covering such spirits on 
Form 5000.24, and remittance, as required by Sec. 19.525, not later 
than the 14th day after the last day of the quarterly return period. If 
the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the return 
and remittance shall be due on the immediately preceding day which is 
not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.

Sec. 19.524  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.

    (a) General. (1) Each taxpayer who was liable, during a calendar 
year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in 
distilled spirits taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this 
part and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter, shall use a commercial bank in 
making payment by electronic fund transfer (EFT) of distilled spirits 
taxes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of distilled spirits 
taxes by cash, check, or money order, as described in Sec. 19.525, is 
not authorized for a taxpayer who is required, by this section, to make 
remittances by EFT. For purposes of this section, the dollar amount of 
tax liability is defined as the gross tax liability on all taxable 
withdrawals and importations (including distilled spirits products 
brought into the United States from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) 
during the calendar year, without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or 
refunds, for all premises from which such activities are conducted by 
the taxpayer. Overpayments are not taken into account in summarizing the 
gross tax liability.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and 
implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except 
that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall be replaced by the words 
``more than 50 percent'' in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 
26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the 
rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar 
fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole 
proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a 
group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one 
taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make 
remittances by EFT.
    (3) A taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances 
by EFT, shall make a separate EFT remittance and file a separate return, 
TTB F 5000.24, for each distilled spirits plant from which spirits are 
withdrawn upon determination of tax.
    (b) Requirements. (1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, 
except for a taxpayer already remitting the tax by EFT, each taxpayer 
who was liable for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million 
dollars in distilled spirits taxes during the previous calendar year, 
combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 
of this chapter, shall notify the appropriate TTB officer. The notice 
shall be an agreement to make remittances by EFT.
    (2) For each return filed in accordance with this part, the taxpayer 
shall direct the taxpayer's bank to make an electronic fund transfer in 
the amount of the taxpayment to the Treasury Account as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section. The request shall be made to the bank 
early enough for the transfer to be made to the Treasury Account by no 
later than the close of business on the last day for filing the return, 
prescribed in Sec. 19.523. The request shall take into account any time 
limit established by the bank.
    (3) If a taxpayer was liable for less than five million dollars in 
distilled spirits taxes during the preceding calendar year, combining 
tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 26

[[Page 430]]

and 27 of this chapter, the taxpayer may choose either to continue 
remitting the tax as provided in this section or to remit the tax with 
the return as prescribed by Sec. 19.525. Upon filing the first return 
on which the taxpayer chooses to discontinue remitting the tax by EFT 
and to begin remitting the tax with the tax return, the taxpayer shall 
notify the appropriate TTB officer by attaching a written notification 
to TTB F 5000.24, stating that no taxes are due by EFT, because the tax 
liability during the preceding calendar year was less than five million 
dollars, and that the remittance shall be filed with the tax return.
    (c) Remittance. (1) Each taxpayer shall show on the return, TTB F 
5000.24, information about remitting the tax for that return by EFT and 
shall file the return with TTB, in accordance with the instructions on 
TTB F 5000.24.
    (2) Remittances shall be considered as made when the taxpayment by 
electronic fund transfer is received by the Treasury Account. For 
purposes of this section, a taxpayment by electronic fund transfer shall 
be considered as received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a 
Federal Reserve Bank.
    (3) When the taxpayer directs the bank to effect an electronic fund 
transfer message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any 
transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer, through normal banking 
procedures, will serve as the record of payment, and shall be retained 
as part of required records.
    (d) Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT. The taxpayer is subject to 
a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5684, 6651, or 6656, as applicable, for 
failure to make a taxpayment by EFT on or before the close of business 
on the prescribed last day for filing.
    (e) Procedure. Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will issue to the taxpayer 
an TTB Procedure entitled, Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer. 
This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer is to follow when 
preparing returns and EFT remittances in accordance with this part. The 
U.S. Customs Service will provide the taxpayer with instructions for 
preparing EFT remittances for payments to be made to the U.S. Customs 
Service.

remittance are to be filed with a designated appropriate TTB officer, 
the proprietor shall file the return and remittance no later than 2:00

    (b) When the proprietor sends the return on Form 5000.24 by U.S.

cover in which the return was mailed shall be considered the date of 
delivery of the remittance. When the postmark on the cover is illegible, 
the burden of proving when the postmark was made will be on the 
proprietor. When the proprietor sends the return with or without 
remittance by registered mail or by certified mail, the date of registry 
or the date of the postmark on the sender's receipt of certified mail, 
as the case may be, shall be treated as the date of delivery of the

                                 Losses


<R05>
Sec. 19.561  Losses in general.

    (a) Allowable losses. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, tax shall not be collected or, if paid, the tax shall be 
refunded when spirits, denatured spirits or wines are lost or destroyed 
while in bond.
    (b) Exceptions. Tax shall be collected in the case of:
    (1) Theft, unless the appropriate TTB officer finds that the theft 
occurred without connivance, collusion, fraud or negligence on the part 
of the proprietor, owner, consignor, consignee, bailee, or carrier, or 
the employees or agents of any of them;
    (2) Voluntary destruction carried out other than as provided in 
subpart U of this part;
    (3) Unexplained shortage of bottled spirits.
    (c) Burden of proof. When it appears that a loss occurred due to 
theft, the burden of proof shall be on the proprietor or other person 
liable for the tax to establish to the satisfaction of the appropriate 
TTB officer that the loss did not result from connivance, collusion, 
fraud, or negligence on the part of the proprietor, owner, consignor, 
consignee, bailee, or carrier, or the employees or agents of any of 
them.

[[Page 435]]

    (d) Claims for losses allowable under this section shall be filed in 
accordance with applicable provisions of subpart C of this part.
    (e) Limitations. The abatement, remission, credit, or refund of 
taxes on spirits, denatured spirits, or wines lost by theft shall be 
allowed only to the extent that the claimant is not indemnified against 
or recompensed for the taxes.

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1323, as amended, 1381, as amended 
(26 U.S.C. 5008, 5370))


<R05>
Sec. 19.562  Determination of losses in bond.

    (a) General. (1) Losses (whether by theft, unauthorized voluntary 
destruction, or otherwise) of spirits, denatured spirits, and wines 
shall be determined by the proprietor:
    (i) Each time a tank or bulk conveyance is emptied;
    (ii) On the basis of required physical inventories; and
    (iii) Upon discovery of accidents or unusual variations in gauges.
    (2) When it appears that any container in bond has sustained a loss 
resulting from theft or unauthorized voluntary destruction, such loss 
shall be taxpaid or the container shall be segregated (as necessary) 
with the loss reported promptly to the appropriate TTB officer.
    (3) In any instance in which spirits, denatured spirits or wines are 
lost or destroyed in bond, whether by theft, unauthorized voluntary 
destruction, or otherwise, the appropriate TTB officer may require the 
proprietor or other person liable for the tax to file a claim for relief 
from the tax in accordance with Sec. 19.41.
    (b) Missing packages. Whenever any packages of spirits, denatured 
spirits, or wine recorded as deposited on bonded premises cannot be 
located or otherwise accounted for, the proprietor shall promptly report 
such fact to the appropriate TTB officer, and the proprietor shall 
either pay the tax on the lost spirits, denatured spirits, or wines, or 
file a claim with respect thereto under the provisions of Sec. 19.41.
    (c) Tampering, material deficiency, or loss of proof. When it is 
found that spirits, denatured spirits, or wines in a container have been 
tampered with, or when a material deficiency in the recorded quantity of 
such products is found without evidence of loss by leakage or casualty, 
or when there is a loss of proof of such products not attributable to 
variations in gauging, the proprietor shall segregate the container (as 
necessary) and shall promptly report such fact to the appropriate TTB 
officer, unless the proprietor acknowledges liability for the tax on the 
loss and elects to pay the tax on the quantity lost.
    (d) Excessive in-transit losses. Losses of spirits, denatured 
spirits, or wines received in bond in bulk conveyances which exceed one 
percent of the quantity of a product consigned shall be considered as 
excessive in-transit losses. However, in the case of transcontinental 
transfers in bond of wine, only losses in excess of two percent of the 
quantity of wine consigned shall be considered as excessive in-transit 
losses. The proprietor shall promptly report all such excessive in-
transit losses to the appropriate TTB officer.
    (e) Storage account loss limitation. When the quantity of spirits 
lost from all the storage tanks and bulk conveyances exceeds 1\1/2\ 
percent of the total quantity contained in the tanks and bulk 
conveyances during the calendar quarter, the loss shall be taxpaid 
unless a claim for remission is filed in accordance with the provisions 
of Sec. 19.41 and is allowed by the appropriate TTB officer.

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1323, as amended, 1381, as amended 
(26 U.S.C. 5008, 5370))


<R05>
Sec. 19.563  Loss of spirits from packages.

    (a) Original quantity. Where there is evidence satisfactory to the 
appropriate TTB officer that any loss of spirits (including denatured 
spirits) from any package deposited on bonded premises is due to theft 
(except where the appropriate TTB officer has made the finding provided 
for in Sec. 19.561(b)) or is due to unauthorized voluntary destruction, 
the appropriate TTB officer may require the immediate tax payment of the 
quantity of spirits so lost, except where the extent of any loss from

[[Page 436]]

causes other than theft or unauthorized voluntary destruction can be 
established by the proprietor to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB 
officer, the appropriate TTB officer may credit the tax on the loss so 
established against the tax on the original quantity.
    (b) Alternative method. Where there is evidence satisfactory to the 
appropriate TTB officer that there has been access, other than as 
authorized by law, to the contents of packages entered for deposit on 
bonded premises, and the extent of such access is such as to evidence a 
lack of due diligence or a failure to employ necessary and effective 
controls on the part of the proprietor, the appropriate TTB officer may 
(in lieu of the procedure prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section) 
assess an amount equal to the tax on 5 proof gallons of spirits on each 
of the total number of such packages as determined by him.
    (c) Applicability to packages filled after entry. The provisions of 
this section apply to spirits (including denatured spirits) which are 
filled into casks or packages as authorized by law, after entry and 
deposit on bonded premises, whether by recasking, filling from tanks, 
mingling, or otherwise. The quantity filled into those casks or packages 
is considered to be the original quantity for the purpose of this 
section in the case of loss from those casks or packages.

<R05>
Sec. 19.564  Losses after tax determination.

    (a) Applicability. Pursuant to a claim, the tax on spirits which are 
lost after determination of tax and before completion of physical 
removal from bonded premises, may be abated or remitted or refunded or 
credited without interest to the proprietor of the bonded premises where 
the loss occurred.
    (b) Conditions. (1) Claims for losses under this section shall be 
filed in accordance with subpart C of this part.
    (2) This section shall not apply if the tax would have been 
collectible by reason of 26 U.S.C. 5008(a)(1) if the loss occurred on 
bonded premises before determination of tax.

<R05>
Sec. 19.565  Shortages of bottled distilled spirits.

    (a) Determination of shortage. Unexplained shortages shall be 
determined by comparing the spirits recorded to be on hand with the 
results of the quantitative determination of the spirits found to be on 
hand by actual count during the physical inventory required by Sec. 
19.402. When the recorded quantity is greater than the quantity 
determined by the physical inventory, the difference is an unexplained 
shortage. The records shall be adjusted to reflect the physical 
inventory.
    (b) Payment of tax on shortage. An unexplained shortage of bottled 
distilled spirits shall be taxpaid:
    (1) Immediately on a prepayment return on Form 5000.24, or
    (2) On the return on Form 5000.24 for the return period during which 
the shortage was ascertained.

Sec. 19.581  Authorized containers.

    (a) General. Proprietors shall use for any purpose of containing, 
storing, transferring, conveying, removing, or withdrawing spirits or

such purpose. Except where stated otherwise, the provisions of part 20 
of this chapter apply to containers used for containing, storing and 
shipping of articles, and the provisions of 27 CFR part 24 apply to 
containers used for storage or transfer of wine. Except for liquor 
bottles, this subpart does not regulate or prohibit the use on plant 
premises of any container for purposes

[[Page 437]]

other than containing alcoholic substances.
    (b) Alternate containers. In addition to the types of containers 
specifically authorized by this part for a particular purpose, a 
container of another type may be authorized for that purpose by the 
appropriate TTB officer on a finding by him that the use of such 
container will afford protection to the revenue equal to or greater than 
that afforded by the containers specifically authorized by this part, 
and that the use will not cause administrative difficulty. If another 
container is so authorized by the appropriate TTB officer, he shall 
prescribe the detail and manner in which such container shall be 
constructed, protected, and marked, consistent with the provisions of 
this part and the extent of such use. Similarly, where a container 
authorized for a particular purpose is required by this subpart to be 
made of specified materials, the appropriate TTB officer may authorize 
the use of containers made of other materials which he has found to be 
suitable for the intended purpose.

Sec. 19.594  Numbering of packages and cases in processing.

    (a) General. Packages of spirits and denatured spirits filled during 
processing operations and cases containing bottles or other containers 
of spirits and denatured spirits shall, when filled, be consecutively 
numbered in a separate series by the proprietor commencing with ``1'' in 
each series of serial numbers, except that any series of such numbers in 
use may be continued. When the numbering in any series reaches 
``1,000,000'', the proprietor may recommence the series. However, a new 
series for packages of spirits and denatured spirits filled during 
processing operations shall be given an alphabetical prefix or suffix. 
For additional identification, separate series of serial numbers, 
distinguished from each other by the use of alphabetical prefixes or 
suffixes, may be established to identify size of bottles, brand names, 
or other information, on written notice to

[[Page 440]]

the appropriate TTB officer. Remnant cases shall be given the serial 
number of the last full case followed by the letter R. Where there is a 
change in the individual, firm, corporate name, or trade name, all 
series in use at that time shall be continued. However, for a change in 
proprietorship, a new series shall be commenced.
    (b) Alternative method for spirits, including denatured spirits, for 
industrial use. Instead of the numbering required by paragraph (a) of 
this section, packages and cases of spirits, including denatured 
spirits, for industrial use filled in processing may be marked with lot 
identification numbers provided in Sec. 19.593.

marked on packages filled with such mingled spirits. However, if the 
proprietor was the actual producer of the spirits, he may in any case

spirits set out in 27 CFR part 5, except that:
    (1) Spirits distilled at more than 160 degrees of proof, which lack 
the taste, aroma, and other characteristics generally attributed to 
whisky, brandy, rum, or gin, and which are substantially neutral in 
character, may be designated as ``Alcohol''. When alcohol is withdrawn 
on determination of tax, the designation shall consist of the word 
``Alcohol'' preceded or followed by a word or phrase descriptive of the 
material from which the alcohol was produced.
    (2) The designations for vodka, neutral spirits, or gin shall 
include a word or phrase descriptive of the material from which the 
spirits so designated were produced.
    (3) Spirits distilled at less than 190 degrees of proof which lack 
the taste, aroma, and other characteristics generally attributed to 
whisky, brandy, rum, or gin, may be designated ``Spirits'', preceded or 
followed by a word or phrase descriptive of the material from which 
produced. However, spirits distilled on or after July 1, 1972, as

fermented mash of not less than 51 percent rye, corn, wheat, malted 
barley, or malted rye grain, packaged in reused cooperage, may be 
designated ``Whisky'' if further qualified with the words ``Distilled 
from rye mash'' (or bourbon, wheat, malt, or rye malt mash, as the case 
may be). However, such spirits shall, if distilled from a fermented mash 
of not less than 80 percent corn, be designated ``Corn Whisky.''
    (b) Change of designation. A proprietor may, on written application 
to, and approval of the appropriate TTB officer, change the original 
designation for spirits at any time, before their withdrawal from bonded 
premises, to a new designation properly describing the spirits in 
accordance with the provisions of this section.
    (c) Other designations. If the proprietor proposes to produce 
spirits for which a designation has not been prescribed, he shall first 
make written application to the appropriate TTB officer for a 
designation for such spirits and such spirits shall be branded 
accordingly.
    (d) Spirits for nonindustrial use. The provisions of this section 
shall not be construed as authority for applying designations to spirits 
withdrawn for nonindustrial use which designations do not comply with 
provisions of 27 CFR part 5.

addresses) of the distiller;
    (b) Where ``straight whiskies'' of the same type which have been 
produced in the same State by two or more different distillers are

place of business in lieu of the place where the bottling, distilling or 
processing operation occurred, if the address where the operation 
occurred is indicated by printing, coding, or other markings, on the 
label or on the bottle. The coding system employed will permit an 
appropriate TTB officer to determine where the operation stated on the 
label occurred. Prior to using a coding system, the distilled spirits 
plant proprietor shall

    (2) The records required by this part may consist of the 
proprietor's commercial documents, rather than records prepared

contain all the details required by this part to be recorded, are 
consistent with the general requirements of clarity and accuracy, and do 
not result in difficulty in their examination.
    (b) Accounts. The records required by this part to be maintained by

rounded to the sixth decimal; or (b) If the conversion is made after 
multiplying by the number of cases, the quantity in U.S. units shall be 
rounded to the nearest hundredth. Once converted to wine gallons, the

than 190 degrees of proof covering: deposit in the storage account of 
spirits received from the production account, from customs custody, or 
by return to bond under subpart U of this part, or of wines or spirits 
from other bonded premises; packages of spirits or wines filled from 
tanks and retained in the storage account after mingling; and wines or 
spirits of less than 190 degrees of proof transferred from one tank to 
another, shall be utilized by the proprietor to record wines or spirits 
deposited in the storage account. The proprietor shall enter the date of 
deposit of the spirits in storage on the record. Files of deposit 
records shall be maintained for spirits in packages and such files shall 
be arranged by producers (by warehouseman in the case of blended rums or 
brandies and for spirits of 190 degrees or more of proof, by the 
warehouseman who received the spirits from customs custody in the case 
of imported spirits, and by producer in the Virgin Islands or Puerto 
Rico in the case of Virgin Islands or Puerto Rican spirits), in 
chronological order according to the date of deposit in the storage 
account, and, when possible, in sequence by lot identification for 
packages. (For the purpose of records under this section spirits 
produced under trade names shall be treated as being produced under the 
real name of the proprietor [producer].) Also, files of deposit records 
shall be maintained, in the manner prescribed by 19.742, for wines and 
for spirits of less than 190 degress of proof in tanks in the storage 
account with a separate file for each tank of wines or spirits. In the 
case of spirits of 190 degrees or more of proof deposited in tanks in

semi-annually (as of June 30 and December 31) the proprietor shall 
remove from his consolidated files of active deposit records all such 
records in excess of those required to cover the quantity of spirits 
shown as remaining in tanks. The deposit records so removed shall be 
those covering spirits first deposited in the storage account.

    The proprietor, on specific approval by the appropriate TTB officer 
as provided in this paragraph, may use an alternate method or procedure 
in lieu of a method or procedure specifically prescribed in this subpart 
or subparts A through X of this part where the provisions of those 
subparts have been incorporated by reference in this subpart. The 
appropriate TTB officer may approve an alternate method or procedure, 
subject to stated conditions, when he finds that--
    (a) Good cause has been shown for the use of the alternate method or 
procedure;
    (b) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and 
consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed 
method or procedure, and affords equivalent security to the revenue; and
    (c) The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any 
applicable provision of law, and will not result in an increase in cost

No alternate method or procedure relating to the giving of any bond, to

this section. Where the proprietor desires to employ an alternate method 
or procedure, he shall submit a written application to do so to the 
appropriate TTB officer. The application will specifically describe the 
proposed alternate method or procedure, and will set forth the reasons 
therefor. The proprietor shall not employ any alternate method or 
procedure until the application has been approved. The proprietor shall, 
during the period of authorization of an alternate method or procedure, 
comply with the terms of the approved application. Authorization for any 
alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment 
of the appropriate TTB officer the revenue is jeopardized or the 
effective administration of this part is hindered by the continuation of 
such authorization. As used in this section, alternate methods or 
procedures include alternate construction or equipment. The proprietor 
shall retain, as part of the records available for examination by 
appropriate TTB officer, any application approved by the appropriate TTB

    (a) Will afford the security and protection to the revenue intended 
by the prescribed specifications;
    (b) Will not hinder the effective administration of this part; and

[[Page 472]]

    (c) Will not be contrary to any applicable provisions of law. 
Variations from requirements granted under this section are conditioned 
on compliance with the procedures, conditions, and limitations with 
respect thereto set forth in the approval of the application. Failure to 
comply in good faith with such procedures, conditions, and limitations 
will automatically terminate the authority for such variations and the 
proprietor thereupon shall fully comply with the prescribed requirements 
of regulations from which the variations were authorized. Authority for 
any variation may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment of the 
appropriate TTB officer the revenue is jeopardized or the effective 
administration of this part is hindered by the continuation of such 
variation. Where the proprietor desires to employ such variation, he 
shall submit a written application to do so to the appropriate TTB 
officer. The application will describe the proposed variations and set 
forth the reasons therefor. Variations will not be employed until the 
application has been approved, except when the emergency requires 
immediate action to correct a situation that is threatening to life or 
property. Such corrective action may then be taken concurrent with the 
filing of the application and notification of the appropriate TTB 
officer, via telephone. The proprietor shall retain, as part of the 
records available for examination by appropriate TTB officers, any 
application approved by the appropriate TTB officer under the provisions 
of this section.

    If under the laws of the particular State, the partnership is not 
immediately terminated on death or insolvency of a partner, but 
continues until the winding up of the partnership affairs is completed, 
and the surviving partner has the exclusive right to the control and 
possession of the partnership assets for the purpose of liquidation and 
settlement, the surviving partner may continue to operate the plant 
under the prior qualification of the partnership. However, in the case 
of a large or a medium plant, a consent of surety must be filed, wherein 
the surety and the surviving partner agree to remain liable on the bond. 
If the surviving partner acquires the business on completion of the 
settlement of the partnership, he shall qualify in his own name from the 
date of acquisition, as provided in Sec. 19.924(a). The rule set forth 
in this section will also apply where there is more than one surviving 
partner.

<R05>
Sec. 19.930  Alternating proprietorship.

    (a) General. (1) An alcohol fuel plant, or a part thereof, may be 
operated alternately by proprietors if--
    (i) The alcohol fuel plant and the proprietors are otherwise 
qualified under the provisions of this subpart, and
    (ii) The necessary operations bonds (if any) and applications 
covering such operations have been filed with and approved by the 
appropriate TTB officer.
    (2) Where alternating proprietorship is to be limited to a part of a 
plant, that part must be suitable for qualification as a separate plant.
    (b) Qualifying Documents. Each person desiring to operate an alcohol 
fuel plant as an alternating proprietor shall file with the appropriate 
TTB officer:
    (1) An application on Form 5110.74 to cover the proposed alternation 
of premises.
    (2) Diagram of premises, in duplicate, showing the arrangement under 
which the premises will be operated. Diagrams will be prepared in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) Evidence of existing operations bond (if any), consent of 
surety, or a new operations bond to cover the proposed alternation of 
premises.
    (4) When required by the appropriate TTB officer, additional 
information as may be necessary to determine whether the application 
should be approved.
    (c) Diagram of premises. Each person filing an application for 
operation of a plant as an alternating proprietor shall submit a diagram 
of the premises. Where operations by alternating proprietors are limited 
to parts of a plant, a diagram which designates the parts of the plant 
that are to be alternated will be submitted. A diagram will be submitted 
for each arrangement under which the premises will be operated. The 
diagram will be in sufficient detail to establish the boundaries of the 
plant or any part thereof which is to be alternated.
    (d) Alternation Journal. Once the applications have been approved 
and initial operations conducted thereunder, the plant, or parts 
thereof, may be alternated. The outgoing and incoming proprietor shall 
enter into an alternation journal the following information:
    (1) Name or trade name;
    (2) Alcohol fuel plant permit number;
    (3) Date and time of alternation; and
    (4) Quantity of spirits transferred in proof gallons.

The alternation journal will remain in the possession of the incoming 
proprietor until the premises are again alternated whereupon it will be 
transferred to the new incoming proprietor.
    (e) Commencement of operations. Except for spirits transferred to 
the incoming proprietor, the outgoing proprietor shall remove all 
spirits from areas, rooms, or buildings to be alternated, prior to the 
effective date and time shown in the alternation journal. Fuel alcohol 
may be either transferred to the incoming proprietor or may be retained 
by the outgoing proprietor in areas, rooms, or buildings to be 
alternated when the areas, rooms, or buildings are secured with locks, 
the keys to which are in the custody of the outgoing proprietor. 
Whenever operation of the areas, rooms, or buildings is to be resumed by 
a proprietor following suspension of operations by an alternating 
proprietor, the outgoing proprietor (except proprietors of small plants) 
must furnish a consent of surety on Form 1533 (5000.18) to continue in 
effect the operations bond covering his operations. This is to be done 
prior to alternating the premises.
    (f) Records. Each proprietor shall maintain separate records and 
submit separate reports. All transfers of spirits will be reflected in 
the records of each proprietor. The quantity of spirits and fuel alcohol 
transferred will be shown in the production and disposition records of 
the outgoing proprietor. The quantity of spirits transferred will be 
shown in the receipt record of the incoming proprietor. Each outgoing 
and incoming proprietor shall include spirits transferred in 
determinations of

[[Page 479]]

plant size and bond amounts. The provisions of Sec. 19.921 regarding 
change in type of plant are applicable to each proprietor. Entries into 
these records will be in the manner prescribed in Sec. Sec. 19.982,

Sec. 19.956  Amount of bond.

    The penal sum of the bond is based on the total quantity of 
distilled spirits to be produced (including receipts) during a calendar 
year. If the level of production and/or receipts at the plant is to be 
increased, and the bond is not in the maximum penal sum, a new or 
strengthening bond shall be obtained.
    (a) Medium plants. A medium plant which will produce (including 
receipts) between 10,000 and 20,000 proof gallons of spirits per year 
requires a bond in

[[Page 480]]

the amount of $2,000. For each additional 10,000 proof gallons (or 
fraction thereof), the bond amount is increased $1,000. The maximum bond 
for a medium plant is $50,000.
    (b) Large plants. The minimum bond for a large plant is $52,000 
(more than 500,000, but not more than 510,000 proof gallons annual 
production (including receipts)). For each additional 10,000 (or 
fraction) proof gallons, the amount of the bond is increased $2,000. The 
maximum bond for a large plant is $200,000 (more than 1,240,000 proof 
gallons).

    (a) Equipment and method. Proprietors shall gauge spirits by 
accurately determining the proof and quantity of spirits. The proof of 
the spirits shall be determined using a glass cylinder, hydrometer, and 
thermometer. Proprietors may account for fuel alcohol in wine gallons. 
Unless proprietors desire to do so, it is not necessary to determine the 
proof of fuel alcohol manufactured, on-hand, or removed. The Proprietor 
may determine quantity either by volume or weight. A tank or receptacle 
with a calibrated sight glass installed, a calibrated dipstick, 
conversion charts, meters (subject to approval by the appropriate TTB 
officer, or other devices or methods approved by the appropriate TTB 
officer, may be used to determine quantity by volume. The proprietor 
shall ensure that hydrometers, thermometers, and other equipment used to 
determine proof, volume, or weight are accurate. From time to time 
appropriate TTB officers shall verify the accuracy of such equipment. 
Detailed procedures for gauging spirits are provided in 27 CFR part 30.
    (b) When Required. Proprietors shall guage spirits and record the 
results in their records at the following times:
    (1) On completion of production of distilled spirits;

quantities of spirits produced, received, stored, or processed and to 
verify that all spirits have been lawfully disposed of or used.
    (2) Records which the proprietor prepares for other purposes (i.e. 
invoices or other commercial records) may be used to meet the record 
requirements of this subpart, so long as they show the required 
information.
    (3) Where the format or arrangement of the record is such that the 
information is not clearly or accurately reflected, the appropriate TTB 
officer may require a format or arrangement which will clearly and 
accurately reflect the information.
    (4) Entries required by this subpart to be made into records will be 
made on the day on which the operation or transaction occurs. However, 
these entries may be deferred until the third business day succeeding 
the day on which the operation or transaction occurs when the proprietor 
prepares commercial records concurrent with the individual operation or

process.

    Where spirits are rendered unfit for beverage use before removal 
from the production system, the proprietor shall enter into the 
production records, in addition to the quantity and proof of spirits 
produced, the kind and quantity of materials added to each lot of 
spirits. In such a case, a separate record under Sec. 19.985 is not 
required. The quantity of spirits produced will be determined by 
substracting the quantity of materials added to render the spirits unfit 
for beverage use from the quantity of fuel alcohol produced and 
multiplying the resulting figure by the proof of each lot of spirits. 
The proprietor shall determine the proof of each lot of spirits. The 
proprietor shall procure a representative sample of each lot, prior to 
the addition of any material for rendering the spirits unfit for 
beverage use, and proof the sample in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 19.980(a). This paragraph applies to in-line addition of materials 
and to systems in which, before any spirits come off the production 
equipment, the proprietor adds materials for rendering the spirits unfit 
for beverage use to the first receptacle where spirits are to be 
deposited.

which may affect labeling of articles, as described in this section.
    (b) Consumer Product Safety Commission. The Consumer Product Safety 
Commission has promulgated regulations to administer the Federal 
Hazardous Substances Act. The regulations in 16 CFR Chapter II require 
warning labels for products containing certain specified substances. For 
example, S.D.A. Formula Nos. 3-A and 30 require warning labels because 
they contain methyl alcohol, a hazardous substance at levels of 4% or 
more by weight. Manufacturers, reprocessors, rebottlers, and repackagers 
who convey articles containing strong chemicals should refer to 16 CFR 
Chapter II for warning label requirements.

has promulgated regulations to administer the Fair Packaging and 
Labeling Act. The regulations in 16 CFR Chapter I affect packaging and 
labeling of ``consumer commodities.'' The term ``consumer commodities'' 
generally means products intended for retail sale to an individual for 
personal or household use. The F.T.C. regulations do not apply to drugs, 
medical devices, or cosmetics for which the Food and Drug Administration 
enforces the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (see paragraph (d) of this 
section). Manufacturers, reprocessors, rebottlers, and repackagers who 
convey articles which are ``consumer commodities'' should refer to 16 
CFR Chapter I for packaging and labeling requirements.
    (d) Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health and Human 
Services. The Food and Drug Administration has promulgated regulations 
in 21 CFR Chapter I to administer the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act 
(as it applies to drugs, medical devices, or cosmetics) and the Federal 
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Manufacturers, reprocessors, rebottlers, 
and repackagers who convey articles which are drugs, medical devices, or 
cosmetics should refer

    (c) Persons distributing and using (but not recovering for reuse) 
completely denatured alcohol are not required to obtain a permit or file 
a bond under this part.
    (d) Any person recovering completely denatured alcohol for reuse

completely denatured alcohol.
    (e) Containers of products manufactured with completely denatured 
alcohol (such as proprietary antifreeze solutions, solvents, thinners, 
and lacquers) may not be branded as completely denatured alcohol. These 
products may not be advertised, shipped, sold, or offered for sale as 
completely denatured alcohol.


<R05>
Sec. 20.142  Records of bulk conveyances.

(distilled spirits, wines, and/or beer) fit for beverage use.
    Retail dealer in liquors. A dealer who sells, or offers for sale, 
distilled spirits, wines, or beer to any person other than a dealer.

Sec. 24.52  Dealer registration.

    Every proprietor who sells or offers for sale any alcohol product 
(distilled spirits, wines, or beer) fit for beverage use must register 
as a dealer in accordance with part 31 of this chapter. However, the 
proprietor's application to establish and operate a bonded wine premises 
or taxpaid wine bottling house filed under subpart D of this part, and 
approval of that application by the appropriate TTB officer, will 
constitute the proprietor's registration as a dealer at the approved 
bonded or taxpaid wine premises. Every proprietor registered as a dealer 
under this section will be classified as a wholesale dealer in liquors 
(see Sec. 31.32 of this chapter) and as such may also operate

[[Page 589]]

as a retail dealer in liquors without additional registration. 
Registration covers all sales from the same location, including sales of 
spirits, beer, or other proprietors' wine. As provided in Sec. 31.52 of 
this chapter, the proprietor is subject to no additional registration 
for making sales of wine or beer at the customer's place of business. 
Otherwise, a proprietor who conducts business as a dealer at a location 
other than the bonded wine premises or taxpaid wine bottling house must 
register and keep records in accordance with part 31 of this chapter.

part. Whenever there is a change to any of the information provided in 
the proprietor's approved application, the proprietor must amend the 
application within the time period specified in subpart D of this part. 
An amendment of the proprietor's wine premises approved application will 
also amend the proprietor's dealer registration under Sec. 24.52. The 
proprietor's dealer registration will also terminate when wine 
operations authorized under this part terminate.

Sec. 24.80  General.

    The proprietor shall, before production, obtain approval of the 
formula and process by which special natural wine, agricultural wine, 
and other than standard wine (except distilling material or vinegar 
stock) are to be made. The formula must be prepared and filed on TTB F 
5120.29, Formula and Process for Wine, in accordance with the 
instructions on the form. A nonbeverage wine formula will show the 
intended use of the finished wine or wine product. Any formula approved 
under this section will remain in effect until revoked, superseded, or 
voluntarily surrendered. Except for research, development, and testing, 
no special natural wine, agricultural wine, or, if required to be 
covered by an approved formula, wine other than standard wine may be

Sec. 24.81  Filing of formulas.

    The proprietor shall on each formula filed designate all ingredients 
and, if required, describe each process used to produce the wine. The 
addition or elimination of ingredients, changes in quantities used, and 
changes in the process of production, or any other change in an approved 
formula, will require the filing of a new TTB F 5120.29. After a change 
in formula is approved, the original formula must be surrendered to the 
appropriate TTB officer. The proprietor shall serially number each 
formula, commencing with ``1'' and continuing thereafter in numerical 
sequence. Nonbeverage wine formulas will be prefixed with the symbol 
``NB.'' The appropriate TTB officer may at any time require the 
proprietor to file a statement of process in addition to that required 
by the TTB F 5120.29 or any other data to determine whether the formula 
should be approved or the approval continued. (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859,

<R05>
Sec. 24.85  Essences.

    Essences or extracts (preparations of natural constituents extracted 
from fruit, herbs, berries, etc.) may be used in the production of any 
formula wine except agricultural wine. The essences may be produced on 
wine premises or elsewhere. Where an essence contains spirits, use of 
the essence may not increase the volume of the wine more than 10 percent 
nor its alcohol content more than four percent by volume. (Sec. 201, 
Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1386, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5386))


<R05>
Sec. 24.86  Essences produced on wine premises.

    Wine, taxpaid spirits, or spirits withdrawn tax-free may be used in 
the production of essences on wine premises. The description of the 
process for producing the essence may be included as part of a formula 
for the production of a formula wine or a separate formula may be filed 
on TTB F5120.29. If a separate formula is filed for the essence, the 
serial number of the formula by which it is produced will be shown in 
the TTB F 5120.29 covering the formula wine in which it is to be used. 
If an essence is to be made in quantities greater than required for 
individual lots of formula wine, and stored on the premises, a separate 
formula will be filed for the essence. Essences made on wine premises 
with wine spirits withdrawn free of tax pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 5214(a)(5) 
may only be used in the production of a formula wine, and may not be 
removed from the premises where made. Essences made on wine premises 
with the use of tax-free spirits withdrawn free of tax pursuant to 26 
U.S.C. 5214(a)(13) may only be used in the production of a nonbeverage 
wine or wine product and may not be removed from the premises where 
made. The TTB F 5120.29 for the production of an essence is filed in the 
same manner as for the production of formula wine and a sample of the 
essence produced will be at least four fluid ounces. (Sec. 201, Pub. L.

<R05>
Sec. 24.87  Essences made elsewhere.

    Before an essence not made on wine premises may be used in the 
production of formula wine, the manufacturer of the essence shall obtain 
approval from the appropriate TTB officer. The request for approval will 
identify the essence by name or number and by the name of the 
manufacturer, and a sample of at least four fluid ounces of the essence 
will be submitted. However, a request for approval and submission of a 
sample is not required if the essence is made pursuant to approval of a 
formula on TTB F 5530.5, Formula and Process for Nonbeverage Product. 
Essences made under an approved formula on TTB F 5530.5 will be 
described on TTB F 5120.29 by showing the name of the manufacturer, the 
manufacturer's nonbeverage drawback formula number, and the date of 
approval by the appropriate TTB officer. (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72

the necessary applications and bonds and have qualified under the 
provisions of this part. Where operations by alternating proprietors are 
limited to parts of the wine premises, the application will describe 
areas, buildings, floors, or rooms which will be alternated and will be 
accompanied by a diagram delineating the parts of the wine premises to 
be alternated. A separate diagram will be submitted to depict each 
arrangement under which the wine premises will be operated. Once the 
qualifying documents have been approved, and operations initiated, the 
wine premises, or parts thereof, may be alternated. Any transfer of 
wine, spirits, or other accountable materials from one proprietor to the 
other proprietor will be indicated in the records and reports of each 
proprietor. Operation of a bonded winery engaged in the production of

spirits, and other accountable materials may be retained in locked tanks 
at wine premises to be alternated and remain in the custody of the 
outgoing proprietor.
    (c) Bonds. The outgoing proprietor who has filed bond and intends to 
resume operation of the alternated areas, buildings, floors, or rooms 
following suspension of operations by an alternating proprietor shall 
execute a consent of surety to continue in effect all bonds. Where wine, 
spirits, or other accountable materials subject to tax under 26 U.S.C. 
chapter 51 are to be retained in tanks on the wine premises to be 
alternated, the outgoing proprietor shall also execute a consent of 
surety to continue the liability of all bonds for the tax on the 
materials, notwithstanding the change in proprietorship.
    (d) Records. Each proprietor shall maintain separate records and 
submit a separate TTB F 5120.17, Report of Bonded Wine Premises 
Operations. All transfers of wine, spirits, and other accountable 
materials will be reflected in the records of each proprietor. Each 
proprietor shall maintain a record showing the name and registry number 
of the incoming or outgoing proprietor, the effective date and hour of 
alternation, and the quantity in gallons and the percent alcohol by 
volume or proof of any wine, spirits, or other accountable materials 
transferred or received. (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1378, as

of the Government demand it, or in any case where the validity of the 
bond becomes impaired in whole or in part for any reason, the principal 
will be required to give a new bond. A new bond will be required 
immediately in the case of the insolvency of a corporate surety. 
Executors, administrators, assignees, receivers, trustees, or other 
persons acting in a fiduciary capacity, to continue or to liquidate the 
business of the principal, will execute and file a new bond or obtain 
the consent of the surety or sureties on the existing bond or bonds. 
When under the provisions of Sec. 24.157 the surety has filed an 
application to be relieved of liability under any bond given under this 
part and the principal desires or intends to continue business or 
operations to which the bond relates, the principal shall file a valid 
superseding bond to be effective on or before the date specified in the 
surety's notice. New or superseding bonds will show the current date of 
execution and the effective date. (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat.

Sec. 24.176  Crushing and fermentation.

    (a) Natural wine production. Water may be used to flush equipment 
during the crushing process or to facilitate fermentation but the 
density of the juice may not be reduced below 22 degrees Brix. However, 
if the juice is already less than 23 degrees Brix, the use of water to 
flush equipment or facilitate fermentation is limited to a juice density 
reduction of no more than one degree Brix. At the start of fermentation 
no material may be added except water, sugar, concentrated fruit juice 
from the same kind of fruit, malo-lactic bacteria, yeast or yeast 
cultures grown in juice of the same kind of fruit, and yeast foods, 
sterilizing agents, precipitating agents or other approved fermentation 
adjuncts. Water may be used to rehydrate yeast to a maximum to two 
gallons of water for each pound of yeast; however, except for an 
operation involving the preparation of a yeast culture starter and must 
mixture for later use in initiating fermentation, the maximum volume 
increase of the juice after the addition

[[Page 615]]

of rehydrated yeast is limited to 0.5 percent. After fermentation 
natural wines may be blended with each other only if produced from the 
same kind of fruit.
    (b) Determination of wine produced. Upon completion of fermentation 
or removal from the fermenter, the volume of wine will be accurately 
determined, recorded and reported on TTB F 5120.17, Report of Bonded 
Wine Premises Operations, as wine produced. Any wine or juice remaining 
in fermentation tanks at the end of the reporting period will be 
recorded and reported on TTB F 5120.17.

Sec. 24.177  Chaptalization (Brix adjustment).

    In producing natural grape wine from juice having a low sugar 
content, pure dry sugar or concentrated grape juice may be added before 
or during fermentation to develop alcohol. In producing natural fruit 
wine from juice having a low sugar content, sugar, or concentrated juice 
of the same kind of fruit may be added before or during fermentation to 
develop alcohol. The quantity of sugar or concentrated juice added may 
not raise the original density of the juice above 25 degrees Brix. If 
grape juice or grape wine is ameliorated after chaptalization, the 
quantity of pure dry sugar added to juice for chaptalization will be 
included as ameliorating material. If fruit juice or fruit wine is 
ameliorated after chaptalization, pure dry sugar added under this 
section is not considered as ameliorating material. However, if fruit 
juice or fruit wine is ameliorated after chaptalization and liquid sugar 
or invert sugar syrup is used to chaptalize the fruit juice, the volume 
of water contained in the liquid sugar or invert sugar syrup will be 
included as ameliorating material. (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat.

<R05>
Sec. 24.178  Amelioration.

    (a) General. In producing natural wine from juice having a fixed 
acid level exceeding 5.0 grams per liter, the winemaker may adjust the 
fixed acid level by adding ameliorating material (water, sugar, or a 
combination of both) before, during and after fermentation. The fixed 
acid level of the juice is determined prior to fermentation and is 
calculated as tartaric acid for grapes, malic acid for apples, and 
citric acid for other fruit. Each 20 gallons of ameliorating material 
added to 1,000 gallons of juice or wine will reduce the fixed acid level 
of the juice or wine by 0.1 gram per liter (the fixed acid level of the 
juice or wine may not be less than 5.0 gram per liter after the addition 
of ameliorating material).
    (b) Limitations. (1) Amelioration is permitted only at the bonded 
wine premises where the natural wine is produced.
    (2) The ameliorating material added to juice or wine may not reduce 
the fixed acid level of the ameliorated juice or wine to less than 5.0 
grams per liter.
    (3) For all wine, except for wine described in paragraph (b)(4) of 
this section, the volume of ameliorating material added to juice or wine 
may not exceed 35 percent of the total volume of ameliorated juice or 
wine (calculated exclusive of pulp). Where the starting fixed acid level 
is or exceeds 7.69 grams per liter, a maximum of 538.4 gallons of 
ameliorating material may be added to each 1,000 gallons of wine or 
juice.
    (4) For wine produced from any fruit (excluding grapes) or berry 
with a natural fixed acid of 20 parts per thousand or more (before any 
correction of such fruit or berry), the volume of ameliorating material 
added to juice or wine may not exceed 60 percent of the total volume of 
ameliorated juice or wine (calculated exclusive of pulp). If the 
starting fixed acid level is or exceeds 12.5 grams per liter, a maximum 
of 1,500 gallons of ameliorating material may be added to each 1,000 
gallons of wine or juice. (26 U.S.C. 5383, 5384).

Sec. 24.179  Sweetening.

    (a) General. In producing natural wine, sugar, juice or concentrated 
fruit juice of the same kind of fruit may be added after fermentation to 
sweeten wine. When juice or concentrated fruit juice is added, the 
solids content of the finished wine may not exceed 21 percent by weight. 
When liquid sugar or invert sugar syrup is used, the resulting volume 
may not exceed the volume which would result from the maximum use of 
pure dry sugar only.
    (b) Grape wine. Any natural grape wine of a winemaker's own 
production may have sugar added after amelioration and fermentation 
provided the finished wine does not exceed 17 percent total solids by 
weight if the alcohol content is more than 14 percent by volume or 21 
percent total solids by weight if the alcohol content is not more than 
14 percent by volume.
    (c) Fruit wine. Any natural fruit wine of a winemaker's own 
production may have sugar added after amelioration and fermentation 
provided the finished wine does not exceed 21 percent total solids by 
weight and the alcohol content is not more than 14 percent by volume.
    (d) Specially sweetened natural wine. Specially sweetened natural 
wine is produced by adding to natural wine of the winemaker's own 
production sufficient pure dry sugar, juice or concentrated fruit juice 
of the same kind of fruit, separately or in combination, so that the 
finished product has a total solids content between 17 percent and 35 
percent by weight, and an alcohol content of not more than 14 percent by 
volume. Natural wine containing added wine spirits may be used in the 
production of specially sweetened natural wine; however, wine spirits 
may not be added to specially sweetened natural wine. Specially 
sweetened natural wines may be blended with each other, or with natural 
wine or heavy bodied blending wine (including juice or concentrated 
fruit juice to which wine spirits have been added), in the further 
production of specially sweetened natural wine only if the wines (or 
juice) so blended are made from the same kind of fruit. (Sec. 201, Pub.

Sec. 24.182  Use of acid to correct natural deficiencies.

    (a) General. Acids of the kinds occurring in grapes or other fruit 
(including berries) may be added within the limitations of Sec. 24.246 
to juice or wine in order to correct natural deficiencies; however, no 
acid may be added to juice or wine which is ameliorated to correct 
natural deficiencies except that in the production of grape wine, 
tartaric acid may be used to reduce the pH of the juice or wine. If 
tartaric acid is used to correct the pH of grape juice or wine, the 
fixed acid level of the juice shall be measured prior to the addition of 
any tartaric acid to determine the maximum quantity of ameliorating 
material allowed. In addition, when using tartaric acid to reduce the pH 
of ameliorated grape juice or wine, the pH cannot be reduced below 3.0.
    (b) Grape wine. Tartaric acid or malic acid, or a combination of 
tartaric acid and malic acid, may be added prior to or during 
fermentation, to grapes or juice from grapes. In addition, after 
fermentation is completed, citric acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, lactic 
acid or tartaric acid, or a combination of two or more of these acids, 
may be added to correct natural deficiencies. However, the use of these 
acids, either prior to, during or after fermentation, may not increase 
the fixed acid level of the finished wine (calculated as tartaric acid) 
above 9.0 grams per liter. In cases where the wine contains 8.0 or more 
grams of total solids per 100 milliliters of wine, acids may be added to 
the extent that the finished wine does not contain more than 11.0 grams 
per liter of fixed acid (calculated as tartaric acid).
    (c) Fruit wine. Only citric acid may be added to citrus fruit, juice 
or wine, only malic acid may be added to apples, apple juice or wine, 
and only citric acid or malic acid may be added to other fruit 
(including berries) or to juice or wine derived from other fruit 
(including berries) to correct natural deficiencies to 9.0 grams per 
liter of finished wine; however, if the wine contains 8.0 or more grams 
of total solids per 100 milliliters of wine, acids may be added to 
correct natural deficiencies to the extent that the finished wine does 
not contain more than 11.0 grams per liter of fixed acid (calculated as 
malic acid for apples and citric acid for other fruit (including 
berries).
    (d) Other use of acid. A winemaker desiring to use an acid other 
than the acids allowed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section to 
correct natural deficiencies shall follow the procedure prescribed in 
Sec. 24.250. A winemaker desiring to use acid to stabilize standard 
wine shall follow the requirements prescribed by Sec. 24.244. (Sec.

spirits plant from which distillates were withdrawn as distilling 
material. Distillates produced from one kind of fruit may not be used in 
the fermentation of wine made from a different kind of fruit. 
Distillates containing aldehydes which are received at bonded wine 
premises and not immediately used will be placed in a locked room or 
tank on bonded wine premises. Distillates containing aldehydes may not 
be mingled with wine spirits. If the distillates contain less than 0.1 
percent of aldehydes, the proprietor shall comply with any additional 
condition relating to the receipt, storage, and use which the 
appropriate TTB officer may require to assure that the distillates are

from the same kind of fruit or from the same variety of berry or grape 
so long as the proportion of volatile fruit-flavor concentrate added to 
the wine does not exceed the equivalent proportion of volatile fruit-
flavor concentrate of the original juice or must from which the wine was 
produced.
    (b) Use of juice or must from which volatile fruit-flavor has been 
removed. Juice, concentrated fruit juice, or must processed at a 
concentrate plant is considered to be pure juice, concentrated fruit 
juice, or must even though volatile fruit-flavor has been removed if, at 
a concentrate plant or at bonded wine premises, there is added to the 
juice, concentrated fruit juice, or must (or in the case of bonded wine 
premises, to wine of the winemaker's own production made therefrom), 
either the identical volatile fruit-flavor removed or an equivalent 
quantity of volatile fruit-flavor concentrate derived from the same kind 
of fruit or from the same variety of berry or grape.

                Subpart G_Production of Effervescent Wine


<R05>
Sec. 24.190  General.

    Effervescent wine may be made on bonded wine premises. Where the 
effervescence results from fermentation of the wine within a closed 
container, the wine is classed and taxed as sparkling wine. The use of 
carbon dioxide, nitrogen gas, or a combination of both, is permitted to 
maintain counterpressure during the transfer and bottling of sparkling 
wine. Wine carbonated by injection of carbon dioxide is classed and 
taxed as artificially carbonated wine. Sparkling wine, artificially 
carbonated wine, and any wine used as a base in the production of 
sparkling wine or artificially carbonated wine, may not have an alcohol 
content in excess of 14 percent by volume. However, wine containing more 
than 14 percent of alcohol by volume may be used in preparing a dosage 
for finishing sparkling wine or artificially carbonated wine. (Sec. 201, 
Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1383, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5382)).

Sec. 24.192  Process and materials.

    In preparing still wine for the production of sparkling wine or 
artificially carbonated wine, sugar and acid of the kinds and within the 
limitations prescribed in Sec. 24.182 may be added with yeast or yeast 
culture to acclimate the yeast and to facilitate the process of 
secondary fermentation or to correct the wine. Fruit syrup, sugar, wine, 
wine spirits, and acid may be used in preparing a finishing dosage for 
sparkling wine or artificially carbonated wine provided the dosage does 
not exceed 10 percent by volume of the finished product. Where the 
proprietor desires to use more than 10 percent by volume finishing 
dosage, the proprietor shall file for a formula approval under Sec. 
24.80. The fruit syrup, wine spirits and wine used will come from the 
same kind of fruit as the wine from which the sparkling wine or 
artificially carbonated wine is made. In the production of sparkling 
wine or artificially carbonated wine, taxpaid wine spirits or wine 
spirits withdrawn tax-free may be used. Tax-free wine spirits may only

[[Page 619]]

be used in the production of sparkling wine or artificially carbonated 
wine which is a natural wine. In the refermentation and finishing of a 
sparkling wine, the acids and materials specifically authorized in Sec.

              Subpart H_Production of Special Natural Wine


<R05>
Sec. 24.195  General.

    Special natural wine is a flavored wine made on bonded wine premises 
from a base of natural wine. The flavoring added may include natural 
herbs, spices, fruit juices, natural aromatics, natural essences or 
other natural flavoring, in quantities or proportions such that the 
resulting product derives character and flavor distinctive from the base 
wine and distinguishable from other natural wine. Fruit juices may not 
be used to give to one natural wine the flavor of another but may be 
used with herbs or spices to produce a wine having a distinctive flavor. 
Caramel and sugar may be used in a special natural wine. However, the 
minimum 60 degrees Brix limitations prescribed in the definition of 
``Liquid pure sugar'' and ``Invert sugar syrup'' in Sec. 24.10 do not 
apply to materials used in the manufacture of vermouth. Finished 
vermouth will contain a minimum of 80 percent by volume natural wine. 
Heavy bodied blending wine and juice or concentrated fruit juice to 
which wine spirits have been added may be used in the production of 
special natural wine pursuant to formula approval. (Sec. 201, Pub. L.

    Agricultural wine may be produced on bonded wine premises from 
suitable agricultural products other than the juice of fruit. Water or 
sugar, or both, may be used within the limitations of this subpart in 
the production of agricultural wine. Agricultural wine may not be 
flavored or colored; however, hops may be used in the production of 
honey wine. Spirits may not be used in the production of the wine and a 
wine made from one agricultural product may not be blended with a wine 
made from another agricultural product. Agricultural wine made with 
sugar in excess of the limitations of this subpart is other than 
standard wine and will be segregated and clearly identified. Since 
grain, cereal, malt, or molasses are not suitable materials for the 
production of agricultural wine, these materials may not be received on 
bonded wine premises. Beverage alcohol products made with these 
materials are not classed as wine and may not be produced or stored on 
bonded wine premises. (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1386, as

Sec. 24.202  Dried fruit.

    In the production of wine from dried fruit, a quantity of water 
sufficient to restore the moisture content to that of the fresh fruit 
may be added. If it is desired not to restore the moisture content of 
the dried fruit to that of the fresh fruit, or if the moisture content 
is not known, sufficient water may be added to reduce the density to 22 
degrees Brix. If the dried fruit liquid after restoration is found to be 
deficient in sugar, sufficient pure dry sugar may be added to increase 
the total solids content to 25 degrees Brix. After addition of water to 
the dried fruit, the resulting liquid may be ameliorated with either 
water or sugar, or both, in such total volume as may be necessary to 
reduce the natural fixed acid level of the mixture to a minimum of 5.0 
grams per liter; however, in no event may the volume of the ameliorating 
material exceed 35 percent of the total volume of the ameliorated juice 
or wine (calculated exclusive of pulp). Pure dry sugar may be used for 
sweetening. After complete fermentation or complete fermentation and 
sweetening, the finished product may not have a total solids content 
that exceeds 35 degrees Brix. (26 U.S.C. 5387)

Sec. 24.249  Experimentation with new treating material or process.

    (a) General. The proprietor may, under the provisions of this 
section, conduct on bonded wine premises such experimentation with a 
treating material or process as the appropriate TTB officer finds may be 
conducted in a manner that will not jeopardize the revenue, conflict 
with wine operations, or be contrary to law.
    (b) Application. The proprietor who wants to conduct experimentation 
must file an application with the appropriate TTB officer setting forth 
in detail the experimentation to be conducted and the facilities and 
equipment to be used. The proposed experimentation must not be conducted 
until the appropriate TTB officer has determined that the conduct of 
such experimentation must not jeopardize the revenue, conflict with wine 
operations, or be contrary to law, and has approved the application.
    (c) Segregation of operations. Experimentation authorized under this 
section will be conducted with the degree of segregation from wine

                 Bottling, Packing, and Labeling of Wine


<R05>
Sec. 24.255  Bottling or packing wine.

    (a) General. Proprietors of a bonded wine premises and a taxpaid 
wine bottling house premises shall be held strictly responsible for the 
correct determination of the quantity and alcohol content of wine 
removed. As required by Sec. 24.170, appropriate and accurate measures 
and instruments for measuring and testing the wine will be provided at 
each wine premises.
    (b) Bottle or other container fill. Proprietors of bonded wine 
premises and taxpaid wine bottling house premises shall fill bottles or 
other containers as nearly as possible to conform to the amount shown on 
the label or blown in

[[Page 636]]

the bottle or marked on any container other than a bottle; but in no 
event may the amount of wine contained in any individual bottle, due to 
lack of uniformity of the bottles, vary from the amount stated more than 
1.0 percent for 15.0 liters and above, 1.5 percent for 1.0 liter to 14.9 
liters, 2.0 percent for 750 mL, 3.0 percent for 375 mL, 4.5 percent for 
187 mL and 100 mL, and 9.0 percent for 50 mL; and in such case, there 
will be substantially as many bottles overfilled as there are bottles 
underfilled for each lot of wine bottled. Short-filled bottles or other 
containers of wine which are sold or otherwise disposed of by the 
proprietor to employees for personal consumption need not be labeled, 
but, if labeled, need not show an accurate statement of net contents.
    (c) Tax tolerance. The net contents of bottles or other containers 
of untaxpaid wine in the same tax class filled during six consecutive 
tax return periods, as determined from the bonded wine premises 
proprietor's fill test records, shall not vary by more than 0.5 percent 
from the net contents as stated on the bottles or other containers. The 
bonded wine premises proprietor is liable for the tax on the entire 
amount of wine in the same tax class when that wine is removed from 
bond, without benefit of tolerance, when the fill of bottles or other 
containers exceeds a 0.5 percent average of a period which consists of 
six consecutive tax returns, or when filling is not conducted in 
compliance with good commercial practice.
    (d) Fill tests. The proprietor shall test at representative 
intervals wine bottled or packed during the bottling or packing 
operation of each bottling or packing line to determine if the wine 
contained in the bottle or other container is in agreement with that 
stated on the label, bottle, or other container.
    (e) Alcohol tests. The proprietor shall test the alcohol content by 
volume to determine the tax class of the wine and to ensure the alcohol 
content to be stated on the label is in agreement with the requirement 
of Sec. 24.257. (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1381, as amended

Sec. 24.256  Bottle aging wine.

    Wine bottled or packed and stored for the purpose of aging need not 
have labels affixed until the wine is removed for consumption or sale. 
However, the bins, pallets, stacks, cases or containers of unlabeled 
wine will be marked in some manner to show the kind (class and type) and 
alcohol content of the wine. If the unlabeled wine is stored at a 
location other than the bottling or packing winery, the registry number 
of the bottling or packing winery will also be shown. (Sec. 201, Pub. L.

<R05>
Sec. 24.257  Labeling wine containers.

    (a) The proprietor must label each bottle or other container of 
beverage wine prior to removal for consumption or sale. The minimum type 
size for information required by this section is: 2 millimeters for 
containers of more than 187 milliliters and 1 millimeter for containers 
of 187 milliliters or less. The maximum type size for alcohol content 
statements is 3 millimeters unless the container is larger than 5 
liters. The label must be securely affixed and show:
    (1) The name and address of the wine premises where bottled or 
packed;
    (2) The brand name, if different from above;
    (3) The alcohol content as percent by volume or the alcohol content 
stated in accordance with 27 CFR part 4. For wine with less than 7 
percent alcohol by volume stated on the label there is allowed an 
alcohol content tolerance of plus or minus .75 percent by volume; and
    (4) The kind of wine, shown as follows:
    (i) If the wine contains 7 percent or more alcohol by volume and 
must have label approval under 27 CFR part 4, the kind of wine is the 
class, type, or other designation provided in that part.
    (ii) If the wine has an exemption from label approval, an adequate 
statement of composition may be used instead of the class and type in 27 
CFR part 4.

[[Page 637]]

    (iii) If the wine contains less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, an 
adequate statement of composition may be used instead of the class and 
type in 27 CFR part 4. The rules in 27 CFR part 4 pertaining to label 
approval and standards of fill do not apply to wine under 7 percent 
alcohol by volume. The rules in 27 CFR part 16 requiring a Health 
Warning Statement do apply to all wines over 1/2 percent alcohol. Except 
for the rules noted in this section, labeling of wines under 7 percent 
alcohol is under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration.
    (iv) The statement of composition must include enough information to 
identify the tax class when viewed with the alcohol content. First, the 
wine should be identified by the word ``wine,'' ``mead,'' ``cider'' or 
``perry,'' as applicable. If the wine contains more than 0.392 grams of 
carbon dioxide per 100 milliliters, the word ``sparkling'' or 
``carbonated,'' as applicable, must be included in the statement of 
composition. If the statement of composition leaves doubt as to the tax 
class of the wine, the wine must be marked ``tax class 5041(b)(1) IRC'' 
or an equivalent phrase. For example, a still wine marked ``wine'' and 
``16 percent alcohol by volume'' is adequately marked to identify its 
tax class as 5041(b)(2). A still wine marked ``hard cider'' and ``9 
percent alcohol by volume'' is adequately marked to identify its tax 
class as 5041(b)(1). A still wine marked ``raspberry hard cider'' and 
``9 percent alcohol by volume'' is adequately marked to identify its tax 
class as 5041(b)(1). A still wine eligible for the hard cider tax rate 
marked ``cider'' or ``hard cider'' and ``6 percent alcohol by volume'' 
is adequately marked to identify its tax class as 5041(b)(6). However, 
if a still wine that is not eligible for the hard cider tax rate is 
marked ``cider'' or ``hard cider'' and ``6 percent alcohol by volume'' 
it is not adequately marked to identify its tax class as 5041(b)(1), so 
the tax class must be shown.
    (5) The net content of the container unless the net content is 
permanently marked on the container as provided in 27 CFR part 4.
    (b) The information shown on any label applied to bottled or packed 
wine is subject to the recordkeeping requirements of Sec. 24.314. (Sec. 
201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1381, as amended, 1407, as amended (26 
U.S.C. 5368, 5388, 5662))
    (c) Use of semi-generic designations--(1) In general. Semi-generic 
designations may be used to designate wines of an origin other than that 
indicated by such name only if--
    (i) There appears in direct conjunction therewith an appropriate 
appellation of origin, as defined in part 4 of this chapter, disclosing 
the true place of origin of the wine, and
    (ii) The wine so designated conforms to the standard of identity, if 
any, for such wine contained in part 4 of this chapter or, if there is 
no such standard, to the trade understanding of such class or type.
    (2) Determination of whether a name is semi-generic--(i) In general. 
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, a name of 
geographic significance, which is also the designation of a class or 
type of wine, shall be deemed to have become semi-generic only if so 
found by the Administrator.
    (ii) Certain names treated as semi-generic. The following names 
shall be treated as semi-generic: Angelica, Burgundy, Claret, Chablis, 
Champagne, Chianti, Malaga, Marsala, Madeira, Moselle, Port, Rhine Wine 
or Hock, Sauterne, Haut Sauterne, Sherry, Tokay. (See: 26 U.S.C. 5368,

Sec. 24.257. The formula number will be marked on bulk containers of 
special natural wine or other wine produced under Sec. 24.218;
    (4) The net contents of each container larger than four liters or 
each case in wine gallons, or for containers larger than four liters or 
cases filled according to metric measure, the contents in liters. If 
wine is removed in cases, the cases may be marked to show the number and 
size of bottles or other containers in each case in lieu of the net 
contents of the case; and
    (5) Except for cases, the date of removal or shipment.
    (b) Application of marks. Required marks may be cut, printed, or 
otherwise legibly and durably marked upon the container larger than four 
liters or the case or placed on a label or tag securely affixed to the

Sec. 24.260  Serial numbers or filling date.

    Each container larger than four liters or each case used for 
removing wine for consumption or sale will be marked with a serial 
number or filling date at the time of filling or when such containers or 
cases are prepared for removal. Serial numbers will commence with ``1'' 
and continue until the numeral ``1,000,000'' is reached, whereupon the 
series may recommence with the numeral ``1.'' However, the proprietor 
may initiate a new series after the numeral ``1,000,000'' has been 
reached provided no numeral will be used more than once during a 12-
month period. If desired, a separate series of numbers with letter 
prefixes may be used for containers larger than four liters and for 
cases, or for cases filled on different bottling lines, or for removals 
from different loading docks. The proprietor may mark containers larger 
than four liters or the cases with the filling date in lieu of using a 
serial number or use both a serial number and the filling date. However, 
if the proprietor desires to change from the use of a serial number to 
use of a filling date, or vice versa, a notice will be sent to the 
appropriate TTB officer before making the change. Where United States or 
foreign wine is recased, the cases will be marked with the date of 
recasing, preceded by the letter ``R'', in lieu of serial number or 
filling date. (72 Stat. 1381; 26 U.S.C. 5367, 5368)

    The proprietor shall be liable for and pay the tax on wine 
unlawfully removed while on bonded wine premises, or while in transit 
thereto or therefrom in bond, unless the proprietor or other person 
responsible for the tax, establishes to the satisfaction of the 
appropriate TTB officer that the theft did not occur as the result of

Sec. 24.266  Inventory losses.

    (a) General. The proprietor shall take a physical inventory of all 
untaxpaid

[[Page 639]]

wine on-hand on bonded wine premises as of the close of business each 
tax year, or where a cycle different from the tax year has been 
established as provided in Sec. 24.313, the inventory will be taken 
annually at the end of that cycle, or at any time required by an 
appropriate TTB officer. The physical inventory of bulk and bottled or 
packed wine will be recorded and reported as required by Sec. 24.313.
    (b) Bulk wine losses. The physical inventory of bulk wine will 
determine losses due to spillage, leakage, soakage, evaporation, and 
other losses normally occurring from racking and filtering since the 
previous physical inventory required by this section. A claim for 
allowance of loss, under the provisions of Sec. 24.65, is required for 
inventory losses in production or storage:
    (1) Where there are circumstances indicating that all or a part of 
the wine reported lost was unlawfully removed, or
    (2) Where the loss on bonded wine premises during the annual period 
exceeds three percent of the aggregate volume of wine on-hand at the 
beginning of the annual period and the volume of wine received in bond 
during the annual period; or the loss exceeds six percent of the still 
wine produced by fermentation; or the loss exceeds six percent of the 
sparkling wine produced by fermentation in bottles; or the loss exceeds 
three percent of the special natural wine produced under Sec. 24.195 or 
other wine produced under Sec. 24.218; or the loss exceeds three 
percent of the artificially carbonated wine produced; or the loss 
exceeds three percent of the bulk process sparkling wine produced.

The percentage applicable to each tax class of wine will be calculated 
separately, unless the calculation is impracticable because of the 
mixture of different tax classes by addition of wine spirits or blending 
during the annual period, in which case the percentage will be 
calculated on the aggregate volume. Wine removed immediately after 
production for use as distilling material and on which the usual 
racking, clarifying, and filtering losses are not sustained, will not be 
included in the calculations.
    (c) Bottle and other container wine losses. Wine filled into a 
bottle or other similar containers are not subject to losses due to 
spillage, leakage, soakage, evaporation, and other losses normally 
occurring from racking and filtering. In addition, wine that has been 
filled into a bottle or other similar containers can be accurately 
accounted for and any unexplained shortage is considered evidence of an 
unreported removal. Therefore, the proprietor shall pay the tax on any 
unexplained loss of untaxpaid bottled or packed wine disclosed by 
inventory or otherwise. (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1381, as

<R05>
Sec. 24.270  Determination of tax.

    The tax on wine is determined at the time of removal from a bonded 
wine premises for consumption or sale. Section 5041 of title 26, United 
States Code, imposes an excise tax, at the rates prescribed, on all wine 
(including imitation, substandard, or artificial wine, and compounds 
sold as wine, which contain 24 percent or less of alcohol by volume) 
produced in or imported into the United States. Wine containing more 
that 24 percent of alcohol by volume is classed as distilled spirits and 
taxed accordingly. The tax is determined and paid on the volume of wine:
    (a) In bottles or other containers filled according to United States 
measure recorded to the nearest 10th gallon; or,
    (b) In bottles or other containers filled according to metric 
measure, on the volume of wine in United States wine gallons to the 
nearest 10th gallon; or
    (c) In the case of pipeline removals, on the volume of bulk wine 
removed recorded to the nearest whole gallon, five-tenths gallon being 
converted to the next full gallon. (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 
1331, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5041))

<R05>
Sec. 24.271  Payment of tax by return with remittance.

    (a) General. The tax on wine is paid by an Excise Tax Return, Form 
5000.24, which is filed with remittance (check, cash, or money order) 
for the full amount of tax due. Prepayments of tax on wine during the 
period covered by the return are shown separately on the Excise Tax 
Return form. If no tax is due for the return period, the filing of a 
return is not required.
    (b) Return periods and due dates--(1) Return periods. (i) 
Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms have the 
meanings indicated:
    Reasonably expects. When used with reference to a taxpayer, 
reasonably expects means the taxpayer was not liable for more than 
$50,000 in taxes the previous year and there is no other existing or 
anticipated circumstance known to the taxpayer (such as an increase in 
production capacity) that would cause the taxpayer's liability to 
increase beyond that limit.
    Taxpayer. A taxpayer is a person who is liable for excise tax 
imposed with respect to wine by 26 U.S.C. 5041 and 7652 under the same 
Employer Identification Number as defined in 26 CFR 301.7701-12.
    (ii) Semimonthly return period. Except in the case of a taxpayer who 
qualifies for, and chooses to use, the annual return period as provided 
in Sec. 24.273 or the quarterly return period as provided in paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section, all taxpayers who have filed a bond for 
deferred payment of taxes must use semimonthly return periods. The 
semimonthly return periods shall run from the 1st day through the 15th 
day of each month, and from the 16th day through the last day of each 
month, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (iii) Quarterly return period. Effective January 1, 2006, a taxpayer 
who has filed a bond for deferred payment of taxes, who reasonably 
expects to be liable for not more than $50,000 in taxes with respect to 
wine imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5041 and 7652 for the current calendar year, 
and who was liable for not more than $50,000 in such taxes in the 
preceding calendar year, may choose to use a quarterly return period. In 
such a case the last day for payment of tax

[[Page 641]]

and filing the return will be the 14th day after the last day of the 
calendar quarter. However, the taxpayer may not use the quarterly return 
period procedure for any portion of the calendar year following the 
first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the taxpayer 
during the calendar year exceeds $50,000, and any tax which has not been 
paid on that date will be due on the 14th day after the last day of the 
semimonthly period in which that date occurs.
    (2) Semimonthly and quarterly tax return due dates. The taxpayer 
shall file the semimonthly or quarterly return, with remittance, for 
each return period not later than the 14th day after the last day of the 
return period. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal 
holiday, the return and remittance shall be due on the immediately 
preceding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, except 
as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (c) Special September rule for taxes due by semimonthly return(1) 
Division of second semimonthly period--(i) General. Except as provided 
in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the second semimonthly period 
for the month of September shall be divided into two payment periods, 
from the 16th day through the 26th day, and from the 27th day through 
the 30th day. The proprietor shall file a return on Form 5000.24, and 
make remittance, for the period September 16-26, no later than September 
29. The proprietor shall file a return on Form 5000.24, and make 
remittance, for the period September 27-30, no later than October 14.
    (ii) Taxpayment not by electronic fund transfer. In the case of 
taxes not required to be remitted by electronic fund transfer as 
prescribed by Sec. 24.272, the second semimonthly period of September 
shall be divided into two payment periods, from the 16th day through the 
25th day, and the 26th day through the 30th day. The proprietor shall 
file a return on Form 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period 
September 16-25, no later than September 28. The proprietor shall file a 
return on Form 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 
26-30, no later than October 14.
    (2) Amount of payment: Safe harbor rule. (i) Taxpayers are 
considered to have met the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section, if the amount paid no later than September 29 is not less than 
11/15 (73.3 percent) of the tax liability incurred for the semimonthly 
period beginning on September 1 and ending on September 15, and if any 
underpayment of tax is paid by October 14.
    (ii) Taxpayers are considered to have met the requirements of 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, if the amount paid no later than 
September 28 is not less than 2/3rds (66.7 percent) of the tax liability 
incurred for the semimonthly period beginning on September 1 and ending 
on September 15, and if any underpayment of tax is paid by October 14.
    (3) Last day for payment. If the required due date for taxpayment 
for the periods September 16-25 or September 16-26 as applicable, falls 
on a Saturday or legal holiday, the return and remittance shall be due 
on the immediately preceding day. If the required due date falls on a 
Sunday, the return and remittance shall be due on the immediately 
following day.
    (4) Example. Payment of tax for the month of September. (i) Facts. 
X, a proprietor required to pay taxes by electronic fund transfer, 
incurred tax liability in the amount of $30,000 for the first 
semimonthly period of September. For the period September 16-26, X 
incurred tax liability in the amount of $45,000, and for the period 
September 27-30, X incurred tax liability in the amount of $2,000.
    (ii) Payment requirement. X's payment of tax in the amount of 
$30,000 for the first semimonthly period of September is due no later 
than September 29 (Sec. 24.271(b)). X's payment of tax for the period 
September 16-26 is also due no later than September 29 (Sec. 
24.271(c)(1)(i)). X may use the safe harbor rule to determine the amount 
of payment due for the period of September 16-26 (Sec. 24.271(c)(2)). 
Under the safe harbor rule, X's payment of tax must equal $21,990.00, 
11/15ths of the tax liability incurred during the first semimonthly 
period of September. Additionally, X's payment of tax in the

[[Page 642]]

amount of $2,000 for the period September 27-30 must be paid no later 
than October 14 (Sec. 24.271(c)(1)(i)). X must also pay the 
underpayment of tax, $23,010.00, for the period September 16-26, no 
later than October 14 (Sec. 24.271(c)(2)).

Sec. 24.272  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.

    (a) General. (1) During a calendar year any proprietor who is liable 
for a gross amount of wine excise tax equal to or exceeding $5 million 
combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 
of this chapter, shall during the succeeding calendar year use a 
financial institution in making payment by electronic fund transfer 
(EFT) of wine taxes for that year. A proprietor who is required by this 
section to make remittance by EFT may not effect payment of wine taxes 
by cash, check, or money order as described in Sec. 24.271.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax 
liability is defined as the gross tax liability on all taxable 
withdrawals and importations (including wines brought into the United 
States from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, 
without regard to any drawback, credit, or refund, for all premises from 
which the activities are conducted by the proprietor.
    (3) For the purposes of this section, a proprietor includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 5061 (e)(3). 
Also, the rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a 
similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole 
proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50 percent control 
over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships 
and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group 
are one taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make 
remittances by EFT.
    (4) A proprietor who is required by this section to make remittances 
by EFT shall, for each bonded wine premises from which wine is withdrawn 
upon determination of tax, make a separate EFT remittance and file a 
separate tax return.
    (b) Requirements. (1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, 
except for a proprietor already remitting the tax by EFT, each 
proprietor who was liable during the previous calendar year for a gross 
amount of wine excise tax equal to or exceeding $5 million, combining 
tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 of this 
chapter, shall give written notice to the appropriate TTB officer 
agreeing to make remittances by EFT.
    (2) For each return filed in accordance with this subpart, the 
proprietor shall direct the proprietor's financial institution to make 
an electronic fund transfer in the amount of the taxpayment to the 
Treasury Account as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. The 
request will be made to the financial institution early enough for the 
transfer of funds to be made to the Treasury Account by no later than 
the close of business on the last day for filing the return as 
prescribed in Sec. 24.271. The request will take into account any time 
limit established by the financial institution.
    (3) If the proprietor was liable during the preceding calendar year 
for less than $5 million in wine excise taxes, combining tax liabilities 
incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter, the 
proprietor may choose either to continue remitting the tax as provided 
in this section or to remit the tax with return as prescribed by Sec. 
24.271. Upon filing the first return on which the proprietor chooses to 
discontinue remittance of the tax by EFT and to begin remittance of the 
tax with the tax return, the proprietor shall notify the appropriate TTB 
officer by attaching a written notification to the tax form stating that 
no wine excise tax is due by EFT because the tax liability during the 
preceding calendar year was less than $5 million, and that the 
remittance will be filed with the tax return.
    (c) Remittance. (1) The proprietor shall show on the tax return 
information about remitting the tax for that return by EFT and shall 
file the return

[[Page 643]]

with TTB in accordance with the instructions on the tax form.
    (2) Remittances will be considered as made when the taxpayment by 
electronic fund transfer is received by the Treasury Account. For 
purposes of this section, a taxpayment by electronic fund transfer will 
be considered as received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a 
Federal Reserve Bank.
    (3) When the proprietor directs the financial institution to effect 
an electronic fund transfer message as required by paragraph (b) (2) of 
this section, the transfer data record furnished to the proprietor 
through normal banking procedures will serve as the record of payment, 
and will be retained as part of the required records.
    (d) Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT. The proprietor is subject 
to a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5684, 6651, and 6656, as applicable, 
for failure to make a taxpayment by EFT on or before the close of 
business on the prescribed last day for filing.
    (e) Procedure. Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will issue to the 
proprietor an TTB Procedure entitled, Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund 
Transfer. This publication outlines the procedure a proprietor follows 
when preparing returns and EFT remittances in accordance with this 
subpart. The United States Customs Service will provide the proprietor 
with instructions for preparing EFT remittances for payments to be made 
to the United States Customs Service for payment of excise tax on 
imported wine. (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1335, as amended (26

Sec. 24.273  Exception to filing semimonthly or quarterly tax returns.

    (a) Eligibility for annual filing. A proprietor may file the Excise 
Tax Return, Form 5000.24, and remittance, within 30 days after the end 
of the calendar year instead of semimonthly or quarterly as provided in 
Sec. 24.271, if the proprietor has not given a bond for deferred 
payment of wine excise tax and if the proprietor:
    (1) Paid wine excise taxes in an amount less than $1,000 during the 
previous calendar year, or
    (2) Is the proprietor of a newly established bonded wine premises 
and expects to pay less than $1,000 in wine excise taxes before the end 
of the calendar year.
    (b) Loss of eligibility for annual filing. (1) If before the close 
of the current calendar year the wine excise tax owed will exceed the 
amount of the coverage under the proprietor's operations bond for wine 
removed from bonded wine premises on which tax has been determined but 
not paid, the proprietor will file an Excise Tax Return with the total 
remittance on the date the wine excise tax owed will exceed such amount 
and file an aggregate Excise Tax Return within 30 days after the close 
of the calendar year showing the total wine tax liability for such 
calendar year. If before the close of the current calendar year the wine 
excise tax liability (including any amounts paid or owed) equals $1,000 
or more, the proprietor will commence semimonthly or quarterly filing of 
the wine Excise Tax Returns and making of payments as required by Sec. 
24.271.
    (2) If there is a jeopardy to the revenue, the appropriate TTB 
officer may deny the exceptions to filing tax returns provided in this 
section at any time.
    (c) Other rules apply. A proprietor who files under this section is 
subject to the failure to pay or file provisions of Sec. 24.274.

Sec. 24.274  Failure to timely pay tax or file a return.

    Penalties for failure to pay tax at the time required, for willful 
refusal to pay the tax and for fraudulent nonpayment of tax are provided 
for in 26 U.S.C. 5661 and 6656. In addition to these penalties, there is 
a penalty for the delinquent filing of a tax return, imposed as an 
addition to the tax shown on the return, amounting to five percent for 
each

[[Page 644]]

month or fraction thereof of the delinquency, not exceeding 25 percent 
in the aggregate, unless it is shown that the delinquency is due to 
reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859,

Sec. 24.275  Prepayment of tax.

    (a) General. The proprietor shall, before removal of wine for 
consumption or sale, file Excise Tax Return, TTB F 5000.24, with 
remittance, where:
    (1) Required to prepay tax under Sec. 24.276; or,
    (2) The tax deferral bond is not in the maximum penal sum and the 
tax determined and unpaid at any one time exceeds the penal sum of the 
bond by more than the amount of such tax covered by the wine operations 
coverage of the wine bond; or,
    (3) There is no approved tax deferral bond and the total amount of 
tax unpaid at any one time exceeds the amount of the wine operations 
coverage of the wine bond designated for wine removed from bonded wine 
premises on which tax has been determined but not paid.

The return with remittance is forwarded pursuant to the instructions 
printed on the return. For the purpose of complying with this section, 
the term ``forwarding'' means deposit in the United States mail properly 
addressed to TTB.
    (b) Electronic fund transfer. When the proprietor is required by 
Sec. 24.272 to deliver payment of tax by electronic fund transfer, the 
proprietor shall prepay the tax before any wine can be removed for 
consumption or sale by:
    (1) Completing the Excise Tax Return and by mailing it, as 
instructed on the form, to TTB and
    (2) Directing the proprietor's financial institution to effect an 
electronic fund transfer. (August 16, 1954, ch. 736, 68A Stat. 775, as

Sec. 24.276  Prepayment of tax; proprietor in default.

    When the proprietor fails to forward a payment for wine excise tax 
due by presentment of a check or money order, or when the proprietor is 
otherwise in default of payment of the tax, no wine may be removed for 
consumption or sale until the tax has been paid for the period of the 
default and until the appropriate TTB officer finds the revenue will not 
be jeopardized by the late payment of the tax. Any remittance made 
during the period of the default will be in cash, or will be in the form 
of a certified, cashier's, or treasurer's check drawn on any financial 
institution incorporated under the laws of the United States, or under 
the laws of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or 
in the form of a money order, as provided in 27 CFR 70.61 (payment by

with or without remittance, by United States mail, the official postmark 
of the United States Postal Service stamped on the cover of the envelope 
in which the return was mailed is considered the date of delivery of the 
tax return and, if accompanied, the date of delivery of the remittance. 
When the postmark on the cover is illegible, it is the proprietor's 
responsibility to prove when the postmark was made.
    (b) When the proprietor sends the tax return by registered mail or 
by certified mail, the date of registry or the date of the postmark on 
the sender's receipt of certified mail, as the case

[[Page 645]]

may be, is treated at the date of delivery of the tax return and, if 
accompanied, the date of delivery of the remittance. (August 16, 1954,

Sec. 24.278  Tax credit for certain small domestic producers.

    (a) General. A person who produces not more than 250,000 gallons of 
wine during the calendar year may take a credit against any tax imposed 
by Title 26 of the United States Code (other than Chapters 2, 21, and 
22), in an amount computed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this 
section, on the first 100,000 gallons of wine (other than champagne and 
other sparkling wine) removed during that year for consumption or sale. 
This credit applies only to wine that has been produced at a qualified 
bonded wine premises in the United States. The small domestic wine 
producer tax credit is available only to eligible proprietors engaged in 
the business of producing wine. A proprietor who has a basic permit to 
produce wine but does not produce wine during a calendar year may not 
take the small producer wine tax credit on wine removed during that 
calendar year. A proprietor who has obtained a new wine producer basic 
permit may not take the small producer wine tax credit on wine removed 
until the proprietor has produced wine. ``Production'' of wine includes 
those activities described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (b) Special rules relating to eligibility for wine credit--(1) 
Controlled groups. For purposes of this section and Sec. 24.279, the 
term ``person'' includes a controlled group of corporations, as defined 
in 26 U.S.C. 1563(a), except that the phrase ``more than 50 percent'' 
must be substituted for the phrase ``at least 80 percent'' wherever it 
appears. Also, the rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' 
apply in a similar fashion to groups that include partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships. Production and removals of all members of a 
controlled group are treated as if they were the production and removals 
of a single taxpayer for the purpose of determining what credit a person 
may use.
    (2) Credit for transferees in bond. A person other than the eligible 
small producer (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as the 
``transferee'') may take the credit under paragraph (a) of this section 
that would be allowed to that producer if the wine removed by the 
transferee had been removed by the producer on that date, under the 
following conditions:
    (i) Wine produced by any person would be eligible for any credit 
under this section if removed by that person during the calendar year;
    (ii) Wine produced by that person is removed during that calendar 
year by the transferee to whom that wine was transferred in bond and who 
is liable for the tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5041 with respect to that 
wine;
    (iii) That producer holds title to that wine at the time of its 
removal and provides to the transferee such information as is necessary 
to properly determine the transferee's credit under this paragraph; and
    (iv) At the time of taxable removal, the producer provides to the 
transferee, in writing (each retaining a copy with the record of taxpaid 
removal from bond pursuant to Sec. 24.310), the following information:
    (A) The names of the producer and transferee;
    (B) The quantity and tax class of the wines to be shipped;
    (C) The date of removal from bond for consumption or sale;
    (D) A confirmation that the producer is eligible for credit, with 
the credit rate to which the wines are entitled; and
    (E) A confirmation that the subject shipment is within the first 
100,000 gallons of eligible wine removed by (or on behalf of) the 
producer for the calendar year.
    (c) Time for determining and allowing credit. The credit referred to 
in paragraph (a) of this section will be determined at the same time as 
the tax is determined under 26 U.S.C. 5041(a), and will be allowable at 
the time any tax described in paragraph (a) of this section is payable. 
The credit allowable by

[[Page 646]]

this section is treated as if it constitutes a reduction in the rate of 
the tax.
    (d) Computation of credit. The credit which may be taken on the 
first 100,000 gallons of wine (other than champagne and other sparkling 
wine) removed for consumption or sale by an eligible person during a 
calendar year is computed as follows:
    (1) For persons who produce 150,000 gallons or less of wine during 
the calendar year, the credit is $0.90 per gallon for wine ($0.056 for 
hard cider);
    (2) For persons who produce more than 150,000 gallons but not more 
than 250,000 gallons during the calendar year, the credit is reduced by 
1 percent for every 1,000 gallons produced in excess of 150,000 gallons. 
For example, the credit that would be taken by a person who produced 
160,500 gallons of wine and hard cider during a calendar year would be 
reduced by 10 percent, for a net credit against the tax of $0.81 per 
gallon for wine or $0.0504 for hard cider, as long as the wine or hard 
cider was among the first 100,000 gallons removed for consumption or 
sale during the calendar year.
    (e) Definitions--(1) Production. For purposes of determining if a 
person's production of wine is within the 250,000 gallon limit, 
production includes, in addition to wine produced by fermentation, any 
increase in the volume of wine due to the winery operations of 
amelioration, wine spirits addition, sweetening, or production of 
formula wine. Production of champagne and other sparkling wines is 
included for purposes of determining whether total production of a 
winery exceeds 250,000 gallons. Production includes all wine produced at 
qualified bonded wine premises within the United States and wine 
produced outside the United States by the same person.
    (2) Removals. For purposes of determining if a person's removals are 
within the 100,000 gallon limit, removals include wine that the person 
removed from all qualified bonded wine premises within the United 
States. Wine removed by a transferee in bond under paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section must be counted against the 100,000 gallon limit of the 
small producer who owns that wine, and not against the limit of the 
transferee in bond if the transferee is also a small producer. Champagne 
and other sparkling wines, which are not eligible for credit, do not 
count as removals against the 100,000 gallon limit.
    (f) Preparation of tax return. A person who is eligible for the 
credit must show the amount of wine tax before credit on the Excise Tax 
Return, TTB F 5000.24, and must enter the quantity of wine subject to 
the credit and the applicable credit rate as the explanation for an 
adjusting entry in Schedule B of the return for each tax period. Where a 
person does not use the credit authorized by this section to directly 
reduce the rate of Federal excise tax on wine, that person must report 
on TTB F 5000.24 where the credit will be, or has been, applied. Where a 
transferee in bond takes credit on behalf of one or more small 
producers, the transferee must show in Schedule B of the return the name 
of each producer, each producer's credit rate, and the total credit 
taken on behalf of each producer during the tax return period.
    (g) Denial of deduction. Pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 5041(c)(5), any 
deduction under 26 U.S.C. subtitle A with respect to any tax against 
which the credit is allowed under paragraph (a) of this section must 
only be for the amount of the tax as reduced by the credit.
    (h) Exception to credit. The appropriate TTB officer will deny any 
tax credit taken under paragraph (a) of this section where it is 
determined that the allowance of the credit would benefit a person who 
would otherwise fail to qualify for the use of the credit.

Sec. 24.279  Tax adjustments related to wine credit.

    (a) Increasing adjustments. Persons who produce more wine than the 
amount used in computation of the credit, or who lose eligibility by not 
producing during a calendar year, must make increasing tax adjustments. 
Where an increasing adjustment to a person's tax return is necessary as 
a result of an incorrect credit rate claimed pursuant to Sec. 24.278, 
that person must

[[Page 647]]

make the adjustment on the Excise Tax Return, TTB F 5000.24, no later 
than the return period in which production (or the production of the 
controlled group of which the person is a member) exceeds the amount 
used in computation of the credit. If the adjustment is due to failure 
to produce, the person must make the adjustment no later than the last 
return period of the calendar year. The adjustment is the difference 
between the credit taken for prior return periods in that year and the 
appropriate credit for those return periods. The person must make tax 
adjustments for all bonded wine premises where excess credits were taken 
against tax that year, and must include interest payable. In the case of 
a person who continued to deduct credit after reaching the 100,000 
gallon maximum during the calendar year, that person must make an 
adjustment in the full amount of excess credit taken and must include 
interest payable under 26 U.S.C. 6601 from the date on which the excess 
credit was taken. In addition, the person must include the penalty 
payable under 26 U.S.C. 6662 if the appropriate TTB officer determines 
that the underpayment was due to negligence or disregard of rules or 
regulations and advises the person to include the penalty as part of the 
adjustment. The appropriate TTB officer will provide information, when 
requested, regarding interest rates applicable to specific time periods 
and regarding any applicable penalties. In the case of a controlled 
group of bonded wine premises that took excess credits, all member 
proprietors who took incorrect credits must make tax adjustments as 
determined in this section. In the case of a small producer who 
instructed a transferee in bond to take credit as authorized by Sec. 
24.278(b)(2), and subsequently determines that the credit was less or 
not applicable, that producer must immediately inform the transferee in 
bond, in writing, of the correct credit information. The transferee must 
make any increasing adjustment on its next tax return based on revised 
credit information given by the producer or a TTB officer.
    (b) Decreasing adjustments. Where a person fails to deduct the 
credit or deducts less than the appropriate credit provided for by Sec. 
24.278 during the calendar year, the person may file a claim for refund 
of excess tax paid. The claim must be filed in accordance with Sec. 
24.69. In the case of wine removed on behalf of a small producer by a 
transferee in bond, if the transferee in bond was instructed to deduct 
credit and failed to deduct credit or deducted less than the appropriate 
credit and was later reimbursed for the tax by that producer, the 
transferee may file the claim. The provisions of 26 U.S.C. 6423 and 27 
CFR part 70, subpart F, will apply, and the producer and transferee in 
bond must show that the conditions of Sec. 24.278(b)(2) were met.

<R05>
Sec. 24.296  Taxpaid wine operations.

    (a) General. The proprietor may conduct taxpaid wine operations 
authorized by Sec. 24.102 in an area designated as a taxpaid wine 
premises at a bonded wine premises or at a taxpaid wine bottling house. 
Taxpaid foreign wine may be received on the taxpaid wine premises for 
reconditioning and removal without retaxpayment or for destruction 
without credit of tax. Any taxpaid wine operations will be separate from 
all nontaxpaid wine operations and taxpaid wine will be clearly 
identified as provided in Sec. 24.135. The appropriate TTB officer may 
require any additional segregation and identification of taxpaid wine 
operations as deemed necessary to protect the revenue.
    (b) Treatment and blending. Taxpaid wine may be treated with sulfur 
dioxide compounds, refrigeration or pasteurization and may also be 
preserved, filtered or clarified by the use of methods or materials 
which will not change the basic character of the wine. Water may not be 
added to taxpaid wine. The proprietor who desires to treat wine in any 
manner (other than by simple filtration or the use of sulfur compounds, 
refrigeration or pasteurization) shall first file with the appropriate 
TTB officer an application giving the details of the proposed treatment. 
The proprietor may not use the treatment prior to approval. The 
proprietor may incur civil or criminal liability for using an 
unauthorized treatment of untaxpaid wine. Wine of the same kind (class 
and type), national origin and tax class may only be mixed to facilitate 
handling at a taxpaid wine bottling house; otherwise, the blending of 
taxpaid wine on such premises is prohibited. Taxpaid wine of different 
national origins, but of the same kind and tax class, may only be 
blended on taxpaid wine premises. (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat.

       6  1.5 liter.........................................     2.37753
       4  3 liter...........................................     3.17004
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Per liter. Equivalent gallonage may be determined by multiplying

[[Page 652]]

total liters by a conversion factor of 0.26417 gallons per liter.
    (b) Time of making entries. Any operation or transaction is to be 
entered in records or commercial papers at the time the operation or 
transaction occurs, except that where records are posted from source 
records or from supplemental auxiliary records prepared at the time the 
operation or transaction occurs, entries in another record may be 
deferred to not later than the close of business of the third business 
day succeeding the day on which the operation or transaction occurs. The 
proprietor shall retain all source records and all supplemental or 
auxiliary records which support entries in other records or commercial 
papers in order to facilitate verification of operations by appropriate 
TTB officers. Source records and supplemental or auxiliary records may 
be used as a record of an operation or transaction and to prepare the 
TTB F 5120.17, Report of Bonded Wine Premises Operations, provided the 
record will readily allow for verification of an operation or 
transaction by appropriate TTB officers.
    (c) Prescribed forms. All reports required by this part must be 
submitted on forms prescribed by Sec. 24.20. Entries will be made as 
indicated by the headings of the columns and lines, and as required by 
the instructions for the form. Report forms are furnished free of cost.
    (d) Period of retention. All prescribed returns, reports and records 
(including source records) will be retained by the proprietor for a 
period of not less than three years from the record date or the date of 
the last entry required to be made in the record, whichever is later. 
However, the appropriate TTB officer may require records to be kept an 
additional period not exceeding three years in any case where retention 
is determined to be necessary.
    (e) Data processing. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
section, data maintained on data processing equipment may be kept at a 
location other than the wine premises if the original operation or 
transaction source records required by this subpart are kept available 
for inspection at the wine premises.
    (2) Data which has been accumulated on cards, tapes, discs, or other 
accepted recording media will be retrievable within five business days.
    (3) The applicable data processing program will be made available 
for examination if requested by an appropriate TTB officer.
    (f) Photographic copies of records. The proprietor may record, copy, 
or reproduce records required by this part and may use any process which 
accurately reproduces the original record and which forms a durable 
medium for reproducing and preserving the original record. Whenever 
records are reproduced under this section, the reproduced records will 
be preserved in conveniently accessible files, and provisions will be 
made for examining, viewing and using the reproduced record the same as 
if it were the original record, and it will be treated and considered 
for all purposes as though it were the original record. All provisions 
of law and regulations applicable to the original are applicable to the 
reproduced record. As used in this paragraph, ``original record'' means 
the record required to be maintained or preserved by the proprietor, 
even though it may be an executed duplicate or other copy of the 
document.
    (g) F 5120.17, Report of Bonded Wine Premises Operations. A 
proprietor who conducts bonded wine premises operations must complete 
and submit a F 5120.17 in accordance with the instructions on the form.
    (1) Monthly report. The proprietor must submit F 5120.17 on a 
monthly basis, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g)(2) or 
(g)(3) of this section.
    (2) Quarterly or annual report. (i) General. A proprietor may file a 
completed F 5120.17 on a quarterly or annual basis if the proprietor 
meets the criteria in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) or (g)(2)(iii) of this 
section. To begin the quarterly or annual filing of a report of bonded 
wine premises operations, a proprietor must state the intent to do so in 
the ``Remarks'' section when filing the prior month's F 5120.17. A 
proprietor who is commencing operations during a calendar year and 
expects to meet these criteria may use a letter notice to the 
appropriate TTB officer and file F

[[Page 653]]

5120.17 quarterly or annually for the remaining portion of the calendar 
year. If a proprietor becomes ineligible for quarterly or annual filing 
by exceeding the applicable tax liability or activity limit, the 
proprietor must file F 5120.17 for that month and for all subsequent 
months of the calendar year. If there is a jeopardy to the revenue, the 
appropriate TTB officer may at any time require any proprietor otherwise 
eligible for quarterly or annual filing of a report of bonded wine 
premises operations to file such report monthly.
    (ii) Eligibility for quarterly report filing. In order to be 
eligible to file F 5120.17 on a quarterly basis, the proprietor must be 
filing quarterly tax returns under Sec. 24.271, and the proprietor must 
not expect the sum of the bulk and bottled wine to be accounted for in 
all tax classes to exceed 60,000 gallons for any one quarter during the

Sec. 24.304  Chaptalization (Brix adjustment) and amelioration record.

    (a) General. A proprietor who chaptalizes juice or ameliorates juice 
or wine, or both, shall maintain a record of the operation and the 
transaction date. Records will be maintained for each kind of wine 
produced (grape, apple, strawberry, etc.). No form of record is 
prescribed, but the record maintained will contain the information 
necessary to enable appropriate TTB officers to readily determine 
compliance with chaptalization and amelioration limitations. All 
quantities will be recorded in wine gallons, and, where sugar is used, 
the quantity will be determined either by measuring the increase in 
volume or, for pure dry sugar by considering that each 13.5 pounds 
results in a volumetric increase of one gallon. If grape juice is 
chaptalized and subsequently this juice or wine is ameliorated, the 
quantity of pure dry sugar added to juice will be included as 
ameliorating material. If fruit juice other than grape is chaptalized 
and this juice or wine is ameliorated, the quantity of pure dry sugar 
added for chaptalization is not considered ameliorating material; 
however, if liquid sugar or invert sugar syrup is used, the quantity of 
water in such sugar is included as ameliorating material. The record 
will include the following:
    (1) The volume of juice (exclusive of pulp) deposited in fermenters;
    (2) The maximum volume of ameliorating material to which the juice 
is entitled, as provided in Sec. 24.178;
    (3) The volume of ameliorating or chaptalizing material used; and
    (4) The volume of material authorized but not yet used.
    (b) Supporting records. The amelioration record will show the basis 
for entries and calculations, including determination of the natural 
fixed acid level and total solids content of juice, as applicable. The 
records are maintained on the basis of annual accounting periods, with 
each period commencing on July 1 of a year and ending on the following 
June 30, except the record for an accounting period may be continued 
after June 30, where the juice or wine included therein is to be held 
after that date for completion. When the amelioration of wine included 
in the record for one accounting period is complete, the record is 
closed and any unused ameliorating material may not be used. The 
proprietor may mix wines before amelioration of the wine is completed; 
however, the proprietor shall additionally maintain records necessary to 
establish the quantity of unused authorized material to which the 
resultant mixture would be entitled so that appropriate TTB officers may 
readily ascertain compliance with amelioration limitations. (Sec. 201,

of tax determination, required by Sec. 25.292(a)(8). The taxes shall be 
determined prior to the time that the beer is dispensed into a container 
for consumption.
    (2) If the brewer uses one or more tanks for tax determination, the 
following procedures shall apply:
    (i) Each such tank shall be durably marked with the words ``tax-
determination tank'';
    (ii) The taxes shall be determined each time beer is added to a tax-
determination tank; and
    (iii) The brewer may never simultaneously pump into and out of a 
tax-determination tank.
    (3) A brewer qualified under this section may store, on brewery 
premises, tax-determined beer which is intended for sale at a tavern

<R05>
Sec. 25.55  Formulas for fermented products.

    (a) For what fermented products must a formula be filed? You must 
file a formula for approval by TTB if you intend to produce:
    (1) Any fermented product that will be treated by any processing, 
filtration, or other method of manufacture that is not generally 
recognized as a traditional process in the production of a fermented 
beverage designated as ``beer,'' ``ale,'' ``porter,'' ``stout,''

[[Page 671]]

``lager,'' or ``malt liquor.'' For purposes of this paragraph:
    (i) Removal of any volume of water from beer, filtration of beer to 
substantially change the color, flavor, or character, separation of beer 
into different components, reverse osmosis, concentration of beer, and 
ion exchange treatments are examples of non-traditional processes for 
which you must file a formula.
    (ii) Pasteurization, filtration prior to bottling, filtration in 
lieu of pasteurization, centrifuging for clarity, lagering, carbonation, 
and blending are examples of traditional processes for which you do not 
need to file a formula.
    (iii) If you have questions about whether or not use of a particular 
process not listed in this section requires the filing of a formula, you 
may request a determination from TTB in accordance with paragraph (f) of 
this section.
    (2) Any fermented product to which flavors or other nonbeverage 
ingredients (other than hop extract) containing alcohol will be added.
    (3) Subject to paragraph (f) of this section, any fermented product 
to which coloring or natural or artificial flavors will be added.
    (4) Subject to paragraph (f) of this section, any fermented product 
to which fruit, fruit juice, fruit concentrate, herbs, spices, honey, 
maple syrup, or other food materials will be added.
    (5) Sak[eacute], including flavored sak[eacute] and sparkling 
sak[eacute].
    (b) Are separate formulas required for different products? (1) You 
must file a separate formula for approval for each different fermented 
product for which a formula is required.
    (2) You may file a formula for a beer base to be used in the 
production of one or more other fermented products. The beer base must 
conform to the standards set forth in Sec. 25.15.
    (c) When must I file a formula? (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, you may not produce a fermented product for 
which a formula is required until you have filed and received approval 
of a formula for that product.
    (2) You may, for research and development purposes (including 
consumer taste testing), produce a fermented product without an approved 
formula, but you may not sell or market this product until you receive 
approval of the formula for it.
    (d) How long is my formula approval valid? Your formula approved 
under this section remains in effect until: you supersede it with a new 
formula; you voluntarily surrender the formula; TTB cancels or revokes 
the formula; or the formula is revoked by operation of law or 
regulation.
    (e) Are my previously approved statements of process valid? Your 
statements of process approved before January 3, 2006 are considered 
approved formulas under this section, provided that any finished product 
that could be made under the statement of process would be in compliance 
with the provisions of this part. You do not need to submit a formula 
for approval if a statement of process that remains valid covers the 
product.
    (f) Determinations by TTB regarding specific processes and 
ingredients. (1) The appropriate TTB officer may determine whether or 
not use of a process not listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
requires you to file a formula for approval. The appropriate TTB officer 
may also exempt the use of a particular coloring, flavoring, or food 
material from the formula filing requirement of paragraph (a)(3) or 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section upon a finding that the coloring, 
flavoring, or food material in question is generally recognized as a 
traditional ingredient in the production of a fermented beverage 
designated as ``beer,'' ``ale,'' ``porter,'' ``stout,'' ``lager,'' or 
``malt liquor.''
    (2) You may request a determination from TTB on whether or not the 
use of a process not listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section will 
require the filing of a formula or whether the use of a particular 
coloring, flavoring or food material may be exempted from the formula 
filing requirement of paragraph (a)(3) or paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section. You should mail your request to

[[Page 672]]

the Assistant Chief, Advertising, Labeling and Formulation Division,

subject to the formula filing and approval requirement, the request must 
include:
    (A) A detailed description of the proposed process;
    (B) Evidence establishing that the proposed process is generally 
recognized as a traditional process in the production of a fermented 
beverage designated as ``beer,'' ``ale,'' ``porter,'' ``stout,'' 
``lager,'' or ``malt liquor''; and
    (C) An explanation of the effect of the proposed process on the 
production of a fermented product.
    (ii) When requesting an exemption from the formula filing 
requirement in paragraph (a)(3) or paragraph (a)(4) of this section 
regarding coloring, flavoring, or food material ingredients, the request 
must include the following information:

    (a) Ingredient information. (1) For each formula you must list each 
separate ingredient and the specific quantity used, or a range of 
quantities used. You may include optional ingredients in a formula if 
they do not impact the labeling or identity of the finished product.
    (2) For fermented products containing flavorings you must list for 
each formula: The name of the flavor; the product number or TTB drawback 
number and approval date of the flavor; the name and location (city and 
State) of the flavor manufacturer; the alcohol content of the flavor; 
and the point of production at which the flavor was added (that is, 
before, during, or after fermentation).
    (3) For formulas that include the use of flavors and other 
nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol, you must explicitly 
indicate:
    (i) The volume and alcohol content of the beer base;
    (ii) The maximum volumes of the flavors and other nonbeverage 
ingredients containing alcohol to be used;
    (iii) The alcoholic strength of the flavors and other nonbeverage 
ingredients containing alcohol;
    (iv) The overall alcohol contribution to the finished product 
provided by the addition of any flavors or other nonbeverage ingredients 
containing alcohol. You are not required to list the alcohol 
contribution of individual flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients 
containing alcohol. You may state the total alcohol contribution from 
these ingredients to the finished product; and
    (v) The final volume and alcohol content of the finished product.
    (b) Process information. For each formula you must describe in 
detail each process used to produce a fermented beverage.
    (c) Alcohol content. For each formula you must state the alcohol 
content of the fermented product after fermentation and the alcohol 
content of the finished product.

[[Page 673]]

    (d) Beer base formulas. You must refer in your formula to any 
approved formula number that covers the production of any beer base used 
in producing the formula product. If the beer base was produced by 
another brewery of the same ownership, you must also provide the name 
and address or name and registry number of that brewery.
    (e) Additional information. The appropriate TTB officer may at any 
time require you to file additional information concerning a fermented

method of manufacture that requires the filing of a formula; or
    (6) Change the contribution of alcohol from flavors or ingredients 
that contain alcohol.
    (b) Superseding formulas. You may file a superseding formula, 
instead of a new formula, if you have made any change listed in 
paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(6) of this section and that change is not 
of a type that would require a holder of a certificate of label approval 
to file a new application for label approval on TTB Form 5100.31.
    (1) A superseding formula replaces an existing formula, and you 
should file one only if you do not intend to use the existing formula 
any more. A superseding formula must be filed with TTB for approval. 
When TTB approves a superseding formula, TTB will cancel your previous 
formula.
    (2) You may use the same formula number for a superseding formula 
that you used for the formula the superseding formula replaces, but you 
must annotate the formula number to indicate it is a superseding formula 
number. (For example, ``Formula 2, superseding.'')
    (c) When you file a new or superseding formula with TTB, you must 
follow the procedures and other requirements of Sec. Sec. 25.56 and 
25.57.

maximum amount of tax calculated at the rates prescribed by law which 
the brewer will become liable to pay during a calendar year during the 
period of the bond on beer:
    (i) Removed for transfer to the brewery from other breweries owned 
by the same brewer;

this part shall calculate the penal sum of the bond by computing 10 
percent of the amount of tax at the rates prescribed by law, on the 
maximum quantity of beer used in the production of concentrate during a 
calendar year. The brewer shall add this amount to the penal sum 
calculated under paragraph (a) of this section to determine the total 
penal sum of the brewer's bond.
    (c) Maximum and minimum penal sums. The maximum penal sum of the 
bond (or total penal sum if original and strengthening bonds are filed)

<R05>
Sec. 25.94  Strengthening bonds.

    (a) Requirement. When the penal sum of the brewer's bond (calculated 
as provided in Sec. 25.93) in effect is not sufficient, the principal 
may prepay the tax on beer as provided in subpart K of this part, or 
give a strengthening bond in sufficient penal sum if the surety is the 
same as on the bond in effect. If the surety is not the same, a new bond 
covering the entire liability is required.
    (b) Restrictions. A strengthening bond may not in any way release a 
former bond or limit a bond to less than the full penal sum.
    (c) Date of execution. Strengthening bonds will show the current 
date of execution and their effective date.

<R05>
Sec. 25.95  New bond.

    The appropriate TTB officer may at any time, at his or her 
discretion, require a new bond. A new bond is required immediately in 
the case of insolvency of a surety. Executors, administrators, 
assignees, receivers, trustees, or other persons acting in a fiduciary 
capacity shall execute a new bond or obtain a consent of surety on all 
bonds in effect. When the interests of the Government so demand, or in 
any case when the security of the bond becomes impaired for any reason, 
the principal will be required to give a new bond. When a bond is found 
to be not acceptable by the appropriate TTB officer, the principal will 
be required immediately to obtain a new and satisfactory bond or 
discontinue business.

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1388, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5401))


<R05>
Sec. 25.96  Superseding bond.

    When the principal submits a new bond to supersede a bond or bonds 
in effect, the appropriate TTB officer, after approving the superseding 
bond, will issue a notice of termination for the superseded bond under 
the provisions of this subpart. Superseding bonds will show the current 
date of execution and their effective date.


<R05>
Sec. 25.97  Continuation certificate.

    If the contract of surety between the brewer and the surety on an 
expiring bond or continuation certificate is continued in force for a 
succeeding period of not less than 4 years from the expiration date of 
the bond or continuation certificate, the brewer may submit, in lieu of 
a new bond, a Brewer's Bond Continuation Certificate on Form 5130.23, 
executed under the penalties of perjury, by the brewer and the surety 
attesting to continuation of the bond. Each continuation certificate 
will constitute a bond and all provisions of law and regulations 
applicable to bonds on Form 5130.22 given under this part, including the 
disapproval of bonds, are applicable to continuation certificates.

forth in the current revision of Treasury Department Circular No. 570, 
Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Reinsuring 
Companies.
    (c) Revisions of Circular No. 570. Treasury Department Circular No.

    (d) More than one corporate surety. A bond may be executed by two or 
more corporate sureties. Each corporate surety may limit its liability 
in terms on the face of the bond in a specified amount. This amount may 
not exceed the limitations set forth for corporate security by the 
Secretary which are set forth in the current revision of Treasury 
Department Circular No. 570. The sum of the liabilities for the sureties 
will equal the required penal sum of the bond.
    (e) Deposit of collateral securities in lieu of corporate surety. 
Bonds or notes of the United States, or other obligations which are 
unconditionally guaranteed as to both interest and principal by the 
United States, may be pledged and deposited by principals as collateral 
security in lieu of corporate surety in accordance with 31 CFR Part 225.

<R05>
Sec. 25.101  Disapproval of bonds or consents of surety.

    (a) Reasons for disapproval. The appropriate TTB officer may 
disapprove a bond or consent of surety if the individual, firm, 
partnership, corporation, or association giving the bond or consent of 
surety, or if any of the above entities owning, controlling or actively 
participating in the management of a business giving a bond as a brewer, 
has been previously convicted in a court of competent jurisdiction of:
    (1) Any fraudulent noncompliance with any provision of law of the 
United States if it related to internal revenue or customs taxation of 
distilled spirits, wines or beer, or if the offense shall have been 
compromised with the individual, firm, partnership, corporation, or 
association on payment of penalties or otherwise; or
    (2) Any felony under a law of any State or the District of Columbia, 
or the United States, prohibiting the manufacture, sale, importation, or 
transportation of distilled spirits, wines, beer, or other intoxicating 
liquor.
    (b) Appeal of disapproval. If the bond or consent of surety is 
disapproved, the person giving the bond or consent of surety may appeal 
the disapproval to the appropriate TTB officer, who will grant a hearing 
in the matter if requested by the applicant or brewer, and whose 
decision will be final.

appropriate TTB officer that the surety desires after a specified date 
(not less than 60 days after the date of service on the principal) to be 
relieved of any liability under the bond which is incurred by the 
principal after the date named in the notice. The surety shall include

against the bond and that it is no longer necessary to hold the 
security, he or she shall fix the date or dates on which a part or all 
of the security will be released. At any time prior to the release of 
the security, the appropriate TTB officer may, for proper cause, extend

subpart I was revised, effective July 28, 2009 through July 30, 2012.


<R05>
Sec. 25.111  Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart, the following terms have the meanings 
indicated:
    Dealer. A person who sells, or offers for sale, any alcohol product 
(distilled spirits, wines, and/or beer) fit for beverage use.
    Retail dealer in liquors. A dealer who sells, or offers for sale, 
distilled spirits, wines, or beer to any person other than a dealer.
    Wholesale dealer in liquors. A dealer who sells, or offers for sale, 
distilled spirits, wines, or beer to another dealer.

(26 U.S.C. 5121, 5122)


<R05>
Sec. 25.112  Dealer registration.

    Every brewer who sells, or offers for sale, any alcohol product 
(distilled spirits, wines, or beer) fit for beverage use must register 
as a dealer in accordance with part 31 of this chapter. However, the 
Brewer's Notice, TTB Form 5130.10, filed under subpart G of this part, 
and approval of that notice by the appropriate TTB officer, will 
constitute the brewer's registration as a dealer at the brewery. Every 
brewer registered as a dealer under this subpart will be classified as a 
wholesale dealer in liquors (see Sec. 31.32 of this chapter) and as 
such may also operate as a retail dealer in liquors without additional 
registration. Registration covers all sales from the same location, 
including sales of wine, spirits, or other brewers' beer. As provided in 
Sec. 31.52 of this chapter, the brewer is subject to no additional 
registration for making sales of wine or beer at the customer's place of 
business. Otherwise, a brewer who conducts business as a dealer at a

[[Page 682]]

location other than the brewery must register and keep records in 
accordance with part 31 of this chapter.

(26 U.S.C. 5124)


<R05>
Sec. 25.113  Amending the dealer registration.

    Every brewer registered as a dealer under this subpart must maintain 
a current and accurate Brewer's Notice, TTB Form 5130.10. Whenever there 
is a change to any of the information provided in the approved Brewer's 
Notice, the brewer must amend the notice within the time period 
specified in subpart G of this part. An amendment to the Brewer's 
Notice, Form 5130.10, will also serve as an amendment of the brewer's 
dealer registration under this subpart. The brewer's dealer registration 
will also terminate when brewery operations under the Brewer's Notice 
terminate.

(26 U.S.C. 5124)


<R05>
Sec. 25.114  Dealer records.

    Every dealer is required to maintain records of transactions. Beer 
transactions that appear in the records required by subpart U of this 
part will meet the brewer's recordkeeping requirements as a dealer. For 
other transactions not covered in the brewery records, such as retail 
sales of wine or distilled spirits in a restaurant at the brewery, or 
operations as a wholesale dealer in wine or distilled spirits, the 
brewer must keep the records specified for dealers in part 31 of this 
chapter.

    (a) General requirements. The brewer's name or trade name and the 
place of production (city and, if necessary for identification, State) 
shall be permanently marked on each barrel or keg. If the place of 
production is clearly shown on the bung or on the tap cover, or on a 
label securely affixed to each barrel or keg, the place of production 
need not be permanently marked on each barrel or keg. No statement as to 
payment of internal revenue taxes may be shown.
    (b) Breweries of same ownership. (1) If two or more breweries are 
owned or operated by the same person, firm, or corporation (as defined 
in Sec. 25.181), the place of production:
    (i) May be shown as the only location on the bung, or on the tap 
cover, or on a separate label attached to the keg;
    (ii) May be included in a listing of the locations of breweries 
qualified under this part if the place of production is not given less 
emphasis than any of the other locations; or
    (iii) Need not be shown if the brewer's principal place of business 
is shown in lieu of any other location. The brewer's principal place of 
business will be the location of a brewery operated by the brewer and 
qualified under this part.
    (2) If the location of two or more breweries is shown on the keg, 
bung, tap cover, or on a separate label attached to the keg (paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii)), or if the brewer's principal place of business is shown in 
lieu of the actual place of production (paragraph (b)(1)(iii)), the 
brewer shall indicate the actual place of production by printing, coding 
or other markings on the keg, bung, tap cover, or on a separate label 
attached to the keg. The coding system employed will permit an 
appropriate TTB officer to determine the place of production (including 
street address if two or more breweries are located in the same city) of 
the beer. The brewer must notify the appropriate TTB officer prior to 
employing a coding system.
    (c) Label approval required. Labels or tap covers used by brewers 
shall be covered by certificates of label approval, Form 5100.31, when 
required by Part 7 of this chapter.

Sec. 25.142  Bottles.

    (a) Label requirements. Each bottle of beer shall show by label or 
otherwise

[[Page 683]]

the name or trade name of the brewer, the net contents of the bottle, 
the nature of the product such as beer, ale, porter, stout, etc., and 
the place of production (city and, when necessary for identification, 
State). No statement as to payment of internal revenue taxes may be 
shown.
    (b) Breweries of same ownership. (1) If two or more breweries are 
owned or operated by the same person, firm, or corporation (as defined 
in Sec. 25.181), the place of production:
    (i) May be shown as the only location on the label;
    (ii) May be included in a listing of the locations of breweries 
qualified under this part if the place of production is not given less 
emphasis than any of the other locations; or
    (iii) Need not be shown if the brewer's principal place of business 
is shown in lieu of any other location. The brewer's principal place of 
business will be the location of a brewery operated by the brewer and 
qualified under this part.
    (2) If the location of two or more breweries is shown on the label 
(paragraph (b)(1)(ii)), or if the brewer's principal place of business 
is shown on the label in lieu of the actual place of production 
(paragraph (b)(1)(iii)), the brewer shall indicate the actual place of 
production by printing, coding or other markings on the label, bottle, 
crown or lid. The coding system employed will permit an appropriate TTB 
officer to determine the place of production (including street address 
if two or more breweries are located in the same city) of the beer. The 
brewer must notify the appropriate TTB offcer prior to employing a 
coding system.
    (c) Distinctive names. If the brewer's name, trade name or brand 
name includes the name of a city which is not the place where the beer 
was produced, the appropriate TTB officer may require the brewer to 
state the actual place of production on the label.
    (d) Tolerances. The statement of net contents shall indicate exactly 
the volume of beer within the bottle except for variations in measuring 
as may occur in filling conducted in compliance with good commercial 
practice. The barrel equivalent of bottles filled during a consecutive 
three month period, calculated on the basis of the brewer's fill test 
records, may not vary more than 0.5 percent from the barrel equivalent 
of bottles filled during the same period, calculated on the basis of the 
stated net contents of the bottles. The brewer is liable for the tax on 
the entire amount of beer removed, without benefit of tolerance, when 
the fill of bottles and cans exceeds the tolerance for the three month 
period, or when filling is not conducted in compliance with good 
commercial practice.
    (e) Label approval required. Labels used by brewers shall be covered 
by certificates of label approval, Form 5100.31, when required by Part 7 
of this chapter.
    (f) Short-fill bottles. A brewer may dispose of taxpaid short-fill 
bottles of beer to employees for their use but not for resale. These 
bottles need not be labeled, but if labeled they need not show an 
accurate statement of net contents.

<R05>
Sec. 25.151  Rate of tax.

    All beer, brewed or produced, and removed for consumption or sale, 
is subject to the tax prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5051, for every barrel 
containing not more than 31 gallons, and at a like rate for any other 
quantity or for the fractional parts of a barrel as authorized in Sec. 
25.156.

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1333, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5051,

<R05>
Sec. 25.152  Reduced rate of tax for certain brewers.

    (a) General. Section 5051(a)(2) of Title 26 U.S.C. provides for a 
reduced rate of tax on the first 60,000 barrels of beer removed for 
consumption or sale by a brewer during a calendar year. To be eligible 
to pay the reduced rate of tax, a brewer:
    (1) Shall brew or produce the beer at a qualified brewery in the 
United States;
    (2) May not produce more than 2,000,000 barrels of beer per calendar 
year; and
    (3) May not be a member of a ``controlled group'' of brewers whose 
members together produce more than 2,000,000 barrels of beer per 
calendar year.

The appropriate TTB officer shall deny use of the reduced rate of tax 
provided by 26 U.S.C. 5051(a)(2) where it is determined that the 
allowance of such a reduced rate would benefit a person who would 
otherwise fail to qualify for use of such rate.
    (b) Definitions. For the purpose of determining eligibility for 
payment of

[[Page 685]]

the reduced rate of tax on beer, terms have the following meanings:
    (1) Controlled group. A related group of brewers as defined in 26 
U.S.C. 5051(a)(2)(B). Controlled groups include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Parent-subsidiary controlled groups as defined in 26 CFR 1.1563-
1(a)(2);
    (ii) Brother-sister controlled groups as defined in 26 CFR 1.1563-
1(a)(3); and
    (iii) Combined groups as defined in 26 CFR 1.1563-1(a)(4). Stock 
ownership in a corporation need not be direct and 51% constructive 
ownership, defined in 26 CFR 1.1563-3, may be acquired through:
    (A) An option to purchase stock;
    (B) Attribution from partnerships;
    (C) Attribution from estate or trusts;
    (D) Attribution from corporations; or
    (E) Ownership by spouses, children, grandchildren, parents, and 
grandparents.
    (2) Production of beer. The production of beer as recorded in the 
brewer's daily records and reported in the Brewer's Report of 
Operations, Form 5130.9. For the purpose of determining compliance with 
the 2,000,000 barrel limitation, production of beer by a brewer or a 
controlled group of brewers includes both beer produced at qualified 
breweries within the United States and beer produced outside the United 
States.
    (c) Brewers operating more than one brewery. Brewers who operate 
more than one brewery shall include the combined production of beer at 
all their breweries when determining eligibility under the 2,000,000 
barrel limitation. The reduced rate of tax applies to the first 60,000 
barrels of beer removed for consumption or sale in a calendar year by 
the brewer; the brewer shall apportion the 60,000 barrels among the 
breweries in the manner described in the notice as provided by Sec. 
25.167(b)(3).
    (d) Controlled groups of brewers. Members of a controlled group of 
brewers shall include the combined production of beer by all member 
brewers when determining eligibility under the 2,000,000 limitation. The 
reduced rate of tax applies to the first 60,000 barrels of beer removed 
for consumption or sale in a calendar year by the controlled group of 
brewers; the controlled group of brewers shall apportion the 60,000 
barrels among member brewers in the manner described in each brewer's 
notice as provided by Sec. 25.167(b)(3).

Sec. 25.155  Types of containers.

    Beer may be removed from a brewery for consumption or sale only in 
barrels, kegs, bottles, and similar containers, as provided in this 
part. A container which the appropriate TTB officer determines to be 
similar to a bottle or can will be treated as a bottle for purposes of 
this part. A container which the appropriate TTB officer determines to 
be similar to a barrel or keg and which conforms to one of the sizes 
prescribed for barrels or kegs in Sec. 25.156 will be treated as such 
for purposes of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 25.156  Determination of tax on keg beer.

    (a) In determining the tax on beer removed in kegs, a barrel is 
regarded as a quantity of not more than 31 gallons. The authorized 
fractional parts of a barrel are whole barrels, halves, thirds, 
quarters, sixths, and eighths, and beer may be removed in kegs rated at 
those capacities. The following keg sizes are

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) If any barrel or authorized size keg contains a quantity of beer 
more than 2 percent in excess of its rated capacity, tax will be 
determined and paid on the actual quantity of beer (without benefit of 
any tolerance) contained in the keg.
    (c) The quantities of keg beer removed subject to tax will be 
computed to 5 decimal places. The sum of the quantities computed for any 
one day will be rounded to 2 decimal places and the tax will be 
calculated and paid on the rounded sum.

    (a) Time and payment. The tax on beer will be determined at the time 
of its removal for consumption or sale, and will be paid by return as 
provided in this part.
    (b) Offsets. During any business day, the quantity of beer returned 
to the same brewery from which removed is to be taken as an offset 
against or deducted from the total quantity of beer removed for 
consumption or sale from

[[Page 687]]

that brewery on the day that the beer is returned.
    (c) Offsets not allowed. An offset or deduction for returned beer 
will not be allowed if:
    (1) The brewer was indemnified by insurance or otherwise in respect 
of the tax; or
    (2) The brewer does not issue credit to the customer for the tax on 
the returned beer within 30 days of the return of the beer. If the tax 
is not timely credited after the offset or deduction is taken, the 
brewer shall make an increasing adjustment on the next tax return.

Sec. 25.160  Tax adjustment for brewers who produce more than 2,000,000 
barrels of beer.

    Each brewer who has paid tax on beer by return, Form 5000.24, at the 
reduced rate of tax during a calendar year, but whose production (or the 
production of a controlled group of brewers of which the brewer is a 
member) exceeds 2,000.000 barrels of beer in that calendar year, is no 
longer eligible to pay tax on beer at the reduced rate of tax for any 
beer removed that calendar year for comsumption or sale. The brewer 
shall make a tax adjustment for the payment of additional tax no later 
than the return period in which production (or the production of a 
controlled group of brewers of which the brewer is a member) exceeds 
2,000,000 barrels of beer. The adjustment will be determined by 
multiplying the difference between the higher and lower rates of tax 
applicable to beer by the number of barrels removed by the brewer that 
year at the reduced rate of tax. The brewer shall make tax adjustments 
for all breweries where tax was paid at the lower rate that year, and 
shall include interest payable from the date on which tax was paid at 
the lower rate. In the case of a controlled group of brewers whose 
production exceeds 2,000,000 barrels of beer, all member brewers who 
paid tax at the lower rate shall make tax adjustments as determined in 
this section.

provided in Sec. Sec. 25.164, 25.164a, 25.173 and 25.175. The brewer 
shall pay the tax by remittance at the time the tax return is rendered, 
and the remittance will be by check or money order payable to the 
``Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms'' and mailed with the return, 
or will be effected by an electronic fund transfer. In paying the tax, a 
fractional part of a cent will be disregarded unless it amounts to one-
half cent or more, in which case it will be increased to one cent.

<R05>
Sec. 25.164  Quarterly and semimonthly returns.

    (a) Requirement for filing. Each brewer shall pay the tax on beer 
(unless prepaid) by return on Form 5000.24. The brewer shall file Form 
5000.24 as a return regardless of whether tax has been prepaid as 
provided in Sec. 25.175 during the return period. The brewer shall file 
a return on Form 5000.24 for each return period even though no beer was 
removed for consumption or sale.
    (b) Payment of tax. The brewer shall include for payment with the 
return the full amount of tax required to be determined (and which has 
not been prepaid) on all beer removed for consumption or sale during the 
period covered by the return.
    (c) Return periods.
    (1) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms 
have the meanings indicated:
    Reasonably expects. When used with reference to a taxpayer, 
reasonably expects means the taxpayer was not liable for more than 
$50,000 in taxes the previous year and there is no other existing or 
anticipated circumstance known to the taxpayer (such as an increase in 
production capacity) that would cause the taxpayer's liability to 
increase beyond that limit.
    Taxpayer. A taxpayer is a person who is liable for excise tax 
imposed with respect to beer by 26 U.S.C. 5051 and 7652

[[Page 688]]

under the same Employer Identification Number as defined in 26 CFR 
301.7701-12.
    (2) Semimonthly return period. Except in the case of a taxpayer who 
qualifies for, and chooses to use, quarterly return periods as provided 
in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, all taxpayers must use semimonthly 
return periods for deferred payment of tax. The semimonthly return 
periods shall run from the brewer's business day beginning on the first 
day of each month through the brewer's business day beginning on the 
15th day of that month, and from the brewer's business day beginning on 
the 16th day of the month through the brewer's business day beginning on 
the last day of the month, except as otherwise provided in Sec. 
25.164a.
    (3) Quarterly return period. Effective January 1, 2006, a taxpayer 
who reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $50,000 in taxes 
with respect to beer imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5051 and 7652 for the current 
calendar year, and who was liable for not more than $50,000 in such 
taxes in the preceding calendar year, may choose to use a quarterly 
return period. In such a case the last day for payment of tax and filing 
of the return will be the 14th day after the last day of the calendar 
quarter. However, the taxpayer may not use the quarterly return period 
procedure for any portion of the calendar year following the first date 
on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the taxpayer during the 
calendar year exceeds $50,000, and any tax which has not been paid on 
that date will be due on the 14th day after the last day of the 
semimonthly period in which that date occurs.
    (d) Time for filing returns and paying tax. Except as otherwise 
provided in Sec. 25.164a for semimonthly tax returns, the brewer shall 
file the tax return, Form 5000.24, for each return period, and make 
remittance as required by this section, not later than the 14th day 
after the last day of the return period. If the due date falls on a 
Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the return and remittance shall be 
due on the immediately preceding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or 
legal holiday, except as otherwise provided in Sec. 25.164a(c).
    (e) Timely filing. (1) When the brewer sends the semimonthly or 
quarterly tax return, Form 5000.24, by U.S. mail, in accordance with the 
instructions on the form, as required by this section, with remittance 
as provided for in this section, or without remittance as provided for 
in Sec. 25.165, the date of the official postmark of the United States 
Postal Service stamped on the cover in which the return and remittance 
were mailed is considered the date of delivery of the return and the 
date of delivery of the remittance, if enclosed with the return. When 
the postmark on the cover is illegible, the burden is on the brewer to 
prove when the postmark was made.
    (2) When the brewer sends the semimonthly or quarterly return with 
or without remittance by registered mail or by certified mail, the date 
of registry or the date of the postmark on the sender's receipt of 
certified mail be treated as the date of delivery of the semimonthly or 
quarterly return and of the remittance, if enclosed with the return.

Sec. 25.164a  Special September rule for taxes due by semimonthly return.

    (a) Division of second semimonthly period--(1) General. Except as 
otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the second 
semimonthly period for the month of September shall be divided into two 
payment periods, from the 16th day through the 26th day, and from the 
27th day through the 30th day. The brewer shall file a return, Form 
5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 16-26, no later 
than September 29. The brewer shall file a return on Form 5000.24, and 
make remittance, for the period September 27-30, no later than October 
14.
    (2) Taxpayment not by electronic fund transfer. In the case of taxes 
not required to be remitted by electronic

[[Page 689]]

fund transfer as prescribed by Sec. 25.165, the second semimonthly 
period of September shall be divided into two payment periods, from the 
16th day through the 25th day, and the 26th day through the 30th day. 
The brewer shall file a return on Form 5000.24, and make remittance, for 
the period September 16-25, no later than September 28. The brewer shall 
file a return on Form 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period 
September 26-30, no later than October 14.
    (b) Amount of payment: Safe harbor rule. (1) Taxpayers are 
considered to have met the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, if the amount paid no later than September 29 is not less than 
\11/15\ (73.3 percent) of the tax liability incurred for the semimonthly 
period beginning on September 1 and ending on September 15, and if any 
underpayment of tax is paid by October 14.
    (2) Taxpayers are considered to have met the requirements of 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if the amount paid no later than 
September 28 is not less than \2/3\rds (66.7 percent) of the tax 
liability incurred for the semimonthly period beginning on September 1 
and ending on September 15, and if any underpayment of tax is paid by 
October 14.
    (c) Last day for payment. If the required due date for taxpayment 
for the periods September 16-25 or September 16-26 as applicable, falls 
on a Saturday or legal holiday, the return and remittance shall be due 
on the immediately preceding day. If the required due date falls on a 
Sunday, the return and remittance shall be due on the immediately 
following day.
    (d) Example. Payment of tax for the month of September--(1) Facts. 
X, a brewer required to pay taxes by electronic fund transfer, incurred 
tax liability in the amount of $30,000 for the first semimonthly period 
of September. For the period September 16-26, X incurred tax liability 
in the amount of $45,000, and for the period September 27-30, X incurred 
tax liability in the amount of $2,000.
    (2) Payment requirement. X's payment of tax in the amount of $30,000 
for the first semimonthly period of September is due no later than 
September 29 (Sec. 25.164(d)). X's payment of tax for the period 
September 16-26 is also due no later than September 29 (Sec. 
25.164a(a)(1)). X may use the safe harbor rule to determine the amount 
of payment due for the period of September 16-26 (Sec. 25.164a(b)). 
Under the safe harbor rule, X's payment of tax must equal $21,990.00, 
\11/15\ths of the tax liability incurred during the first semimonthly 
period of September. Additionally, X's payment of tax in the amount of 
$2,000 for the period September 27-30 must be paid no later than October 
14 (Sec. 25.164a(a)(1)). X must also pay the underpayment of tax, 
$23,010.00, for the period September 16-26, no later than October 14 
(Sec. 25.164a(b)).

<R05>
Sec. 25.165  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.

    (a) Eligible brewers. (1) Each taxpayer who was liable, during a 
calendar year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million 
dollars in beer taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part 
and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter, shall use a commerical bank in 
making payment by electronic fund transfer (EFT) of beer taxes during 
the succeeding calendar year. Payment of beer taxes by cash, check, or 
money order, as described in Sec. 25.163, is not authorized for a 
taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances by EFT. For 
purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is defined 
as the gross tax liability on all taxable removals, determined in 
accordance with Sec. 25.159, and importations (including beer brought 
into the United States from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) during 
the calendar year, without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, 
for all premises from which such activities are conducted by the 
taxpayer. Overpayments are not taken into account in summarizing the 
gross tax liability.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and 
implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except 
that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall be replaced by the words 
``more

[[Page 690]]

than 50 percent'' in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 26 
U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the rules 
for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar fashion to 
groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one 
entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of 
corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, 
all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for the 
purpose of determining who is required to make remittances by EFT.
    (3) A taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances 
by EFT shall make a separate EFT remittance and file a separate return, 
Form 5000.24, for each brewery from which beer is removed upon 
determination of tax.
    (b) Requirements. (1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, 
except for a taxpayer already remitting the tax by EFT, each taxpayer 
who was liable for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million 
dollars in beer taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part 
and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter, during the previous calendar year, 
shall notify, in writing the appropriate TTB officer. The notice shall 
be an agreement to make remittances by EFT.
    (2) For each return filed in accordance with this part, the taxpayer 
shall direct the taxpayer's bank to make an electronic fund transfer in 
the amount of the taxpayment to the Treasury Account as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section. The request shall be made to the bank 
early enough for the transfer to be made to the Treasury Account by no 
later than the close of business on the last day for filing the return, 
prescribed in Sec. Sec. 25.164 or 25.175. The request shall take into 
account any time limit established by the bank.
    (3) If a taxpayer was liable for less than five million dollars in 
beer taxes during the preceding calendar year, combining tax liabilities 
incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter, the 
taxpayer may choose either to continue remitting the tax as provided in 
this section or to remit the tax with the return as prescribed by Sec. 
25.164. Upon filing the first return on which the taxpayer chooses to 
discontinue remitting the tax by EFT and to begin remitting the tax with 
the tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the appropriate TTB officer by 
attaching a written notification to Form 5000.24, stating that no taxes 
are due by EFT because the tax liability during the preceding calendar 
year was less than five million dollars, and that the remittance will be 
filed with the tax return.
    (c) Remittance. (1) Each taxpayer shall show on the return, Form 
5000.24, information about remitting the tax for that return by EFT and 
shall file the return with TTB, in accordance with the instructions on 
Form 5000.24.
    (2) Remittances shall be considered as made when the taxpayment by 
electronic fund transfer is received by the Treasury Account. For 
purposes of this section, a taxpayment by electronic fund transfer shall 
be considered as received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a 
Federal Reserve Bank.
    (3) When the taxpayer directs the bank to effect an electronic fund 
transfer message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any 
transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer, through normal banking 
procedures, will serve as the record of payment, and will be retained as 
part of required records.
    (d) Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT. The taxpayer is subject to 
a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5684, 6651, or 6656, as applicable, for 
failure to make a taxpayment by EFT on or before the close of business 
on the prescribed last day for filing.
    (e) Procedure. Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will issue to the taxpayer 
a TTB Procedure entitled ``Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer.'' 
This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer is to follow when 
preparing returns and EFT remittances in accordance with this part. The 
U.S. Customs Service will provide the taxpayer with instructions for 
preparing EFT remittances

[[Page 691]]

for payments to be made to the U.S. Customs Service.

from a brewery owned by one corporation to a brewery owned by another 
corporation if (a) one corporation owns the controlling interest in the

to the shipping brewery, the brewer is liable under the bond of the 
brewery to which the beer is reconsigned or returned for the tax on beer 
lost in transit.
    (b) Losses allowable without claim. If loss of beer being 
transferred does not exceed two percent of the quantity shipped, the 
brewer is not required to file a report of loss or a claim for allowance 
of the loss if there are no circumstances indicating that the beer, or 
any portion of the beer lost, was stolen or otherwise diverted to an 
unlawful purpose.
    (c) Losses requiring claim. If loss of beer during transit exceeds 
two percent of the quantity shipped, the brewer shall submit a claim 
under penalties of perjury for remission of the tax on the entire loss. 
The brewer shall prepare and submit the claim as provided in Sec. 
25.286.

    (a) Monthly report of operations. Except as provided in paragraph 
(b) of this section, each brewer shall prepare and submit a monthly 
report of brewery operations on Form 5130.9.
    (b) Quarterly report of operations. (1) For calendar quarters 
commencing on or after October 1, 1993, a brewer who produces less than 
10,000 barrels of beer per calendar year may file the report of brewery 
operations quarterly. The report will be filed on Form 5130.9. For the 
purpose of establishing whether a quarterly report may be filed, the 
brewer will determine annual production of beer by adding up the 
quantities of beer produced, water/liquids added in cellars, and beer 
received from other breweries and from pilot brewing plants for all 
months of the previous calendar year.
    (2) To begin the quarterly filing of a Brewer's Report of 
Operations, a brewer will state such intent in the ``Remarks'' section 
when filing the last monthly Form 5130.9 before the calendar quarter 
during which the brewer will commence quarterly filings. A brewer 
beginning business may file Form 5130.9 quarterly if the brewer states 
in the ``Remarks'' section of its initial monthly Form 5130.9 that the 
annual production of beer is not likely to exceed 10,000 barrels.
    (3) If a brewer determines that the 10,000 barrel quantity for a 
calendar year will be exceeded in any month, the brewer shall file a 
Form 5130.9 for that month and for all subsequent months of the calendar 
year.
    (4) The appropriate TTB officer may at any time require a brewer who 
is filing a Brewer's Report of Operations quarterly to file such report 
monthly if there is a jeopardy to the revenue.
    (c) Retention. The brewer shall retain a copy of the Form 5130.9 as 
part of the brewery records.

prepared and kept by the brewer at the brewery where the operation or 
transaction occurs and will be available for inspection by any 
appropriate TTB officer during business hours.
    (b) Reproduction of original records. Whenever any record, because 
of its condition, becomes unsuitable for its intended or continued use, 
the brewer shall reproduce the record by a process under Sec. 25.301. 
The reproduced record

[[Page 710]]

will be treated and considered for all purposes as though it were the 
original record, and all provisions of law applicable to the original 
are applicable to the reproduction.
    (c) Retention of records. Records required by this part will be 
preserved for a period of not less than three years from the date 
thereof or the date of the last entry required to be made thereon, 
whichever is later. The appropriate TTB officer may require records to 
be kept for an additional period not exceeding three years in any case 
where such retention is deemed necessary or advisable for the protection 
of the revenue.
    (d) Data Processing. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
section, record data maintained on data processing equipment may be kept 
at a location other than the brewery if the original transaction 
(source) records required by Sec. Sec. 25.292-25.298 are kept available 
for inspection at the brewery.
    (2) Data which has been accumulated on cards, tapes, discs, or other 
accepted record media will be retrievable within five business days.
    (3) The applicable data processing program will be made available 
for examination if requested by an appropriate TTB officer.

    (a) General. Brewers may record, copy, or reproduce records required 
by this part. Brewers may use any process which accurately reproduces 
the original record and which forms a durable medium for reproducing and 
preserving the original record.
    (b) Copies of records treated as original records. Whenever records 
are reproduced under this section, the reproduced records will be 
preserved in conveniently accessible files, and provisions will be made 
for examining, viewing and using the reproduced record the same as if it 
were the original record, and it will be treated and considered for all 
purposes as through it were the original record. All provisions of law 
and regulations applicable to the original are applicable to the 
reproduced record. As used in this section, ``original record'' means 
the record required by this part to be maintained or preserved by the 
brewer, even though it may be an executed duplicate or other copy of the 
document.

    Distilled spirits excise taxes, less the estimated amounts necessary 
for payment of refunds and drawbacks, collected on all rum imported into 
the United States (including rum from possessions other than Puerto Rico 
and the Virgin Islands), will be deposited into the Treasuries of Puerto 
Rico and the Virgin Islands according to the formula described in Sec. 
26.31. The amount deposited into the Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the 
Virgin Islands shall be the lesser of $10.50, or the rate imposed by 26

26 U.S.C. 5010), on each proof gallon of rum imported into the United

<R05>
Sec. 26.31  Formula.

    (a) The amount of excise taxes collected on rum that is imported 
into the United States from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands shall be deposited into the Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the 
Virgin Islands at the rate prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 7652(f). The 
distribution of such amount between Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands 
shall be computed by using a permanent base percentage, which represents 
the excise taxes collected on rum brought into the United States from 
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands during fiscal year 1983. This base 
percentage is 87.626889 percent for Puerto Rico and 12.373111 percent 
for the Virgin Islands. The formula shall be as follows:
    (1) Multiply the total excise taxes collected on rum brought into 
the United States (including rum from Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands) during the previous fiscal year (October 1-September 30) by the 
base percentages to determine the relative shares of the entire U.S. rum 
market that will be allotted to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands;
    (2) Subtract each of these shares from the excise taxes collected on 
rum transported to the United States from Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands, respectively, during the previous fiscal year to determine each 
possession's loss or gain in relation to the previous fiscal year's U.S. 
rum market. Divide these results by the excise taxes collected on rum 
imported during the previous fiscal year from areas other than Puerto 
Rico and the Virgin Islands.
    (b) Notwithstanding the formula prescribed in paragraph (a) above, 
the Virgin Islands' share of the excise taxes on rum imported into the 
United States from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands 
shall not exceed 49 percent nor drop below 12.373111 percent. Puerto 
Rico's share of the excise taxes on rum imported into the United States 
from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands shall not 
exceed 87.626889 percent nor drop below 51 percent.
    (c) The percentage for the distribution of the excise taxes 
collected on rum imported into the United States from areas other than 
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, that will be paid over to the 
Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, shall be effective on 
March 1 of each year, and shall remain in effect until March 1 of the 
following year.
    (d) The method for transferring the excise tax collections on rum 
imported from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, into 
the Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands shall be the same 
as the method used for transferring excise taxes into the Treasury of 
Puerto Rico on distilled spirits (with an alcohol content of at least 92 
percent rum) brought into the United States from Puerto Rico.
    (e) The formula prescribed in this section shall take effect on 
March 1, 1987. Prior to that date, Puerto Rico shall continue to receive 
86.4 percent of the eligible excise taxes on rum imported from areas 
other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The Virgin Islands shall 
continue to receive 13.6

[[Page 718]]

percent of these eligible excise taxes until March 1, 1987.

   Subpart Cb_Products Coming Into the United States From Puerto Rico


<R05>
Sec. 26.35  Taxable status.

    (a) Liquors coming into the United States from Puerto Rico, except 
as provided in Sec. 26.36, are subject to a tax equal to the internal 
revenue tax imposed on the production in the United States of like 
liquors. Articles coming into the United States from Puerto Rico, except 
as provided in Sec. 26.36, are subject to tax on the liquors contained 
therein at the rates imposed in the United States on like liquors of 
domestic production.
    (b) The excise taxes collected on distilled spirits or articles 
containing distilled spirits shall be deposited into the Treasury of 
Puerto Rico only if at least 92 percent of the alcoholic content of such 
products is rum. The amount deposited into the Treasury of Puerto Rico 
shall not exceed the lesser of $10.50, or the rate imposed by 26 U.S.C. 
5001(a)(1) (including adjustments to the effective tax rate under 26 
U.S.C. 5010), on each proof gallon of such distilled spirits or 
articles, other than eligible articles, containing distilled spirits 
coming into the United States or consumed on the island. Such excise tax 
deposits will be reduced by the estimated amount necessary for payment 
of refunds and drawbacks.
    (c) Except for products described in 26 U.S.C. 7652(c), no excise 
taxes shall be deposited into the Treasury of Puerto Rico if an excise 
tax subsidy is provided by Puerto Rico that is of a kind different from, 
or in an amount per value or volume of production greater than, any

exceed 2\1/2\ percent of the finished product on a proof gallon basis. 
The credit is allowable at the time the tax is payable as if it 
constituted a reduction in the rate of tax.
    (c) Where credit against the tax is desired, the person liable for 
the tax shall establish an effective tax rate in accordance with Sec. 
26.79a. The effective tax rate established will be applied to each

Sec. 26.79a  Computation of effective tax rate.

    (a) The proprietor shall compute the effective tax rate for 
distilled spirits containing eligible wine or eligible flavors as the 
ratio of the numerator and denominator as follows:
    (1) the numerator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product 
(exclusive of distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors), 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001;
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5041(b) (1), (2), or 
(3), as applicable; and
    (iii) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits derived from 
eligible flavors used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate 
prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001, but only to the extent that such distilled 
spirits exceed 2\1/2\% of the denominator prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section.
    (2) The denominator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product, 
including distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors; and
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by twice the percentage of alcohol by volume of each, divided 
by 100.
    (b) In determining the effective tax rate, quantities of distilled 
spirits, eligible wine, and eligible flavors will be expressed to the 
nearest tenth of a proof gallon. The effective tax rate may be rounded 
to as many decimal places as the proprietor deems appropriate, provided 
that, such rate is expressed no less exactly than the rate rounded to 
the nearest whole cent, and the effective tax rates for all products 
will be consistently expressed to the same number of decimal places. In 
such case, if the number is less than five it will be dropped; if it is 
five or over, a unit will be added.
    (c) The following is an example of the use of the formula.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Proof gallons by which distilled spirits derived from eligible 
flavors exceed 2\1/2\% of the total proof gallons in the batch (100.9 - 
(2\1/2\%) x 3.371.8 = 16.6).

Sec. 26.112  Returns for deferred payment of tax.

    (a) Returns. The taxes imposed by 26 U.S.C. 7652(a), (equal to the 
taxes imposed in the United States by 26 U.S.C. 5001(a)(1), 5041, or 
5051), the payment of which has been deferred under the provisions of 
Sec. Sec. 26.80, 26.95 or 26.104 of this part, shall be paid pursuant 
to a return on TTB Form 5000.25 prepared in accordance with the 
instructions on the form.
    (b) Return periods--(1) Definitions. For purposes of this section, 
the following terms have the meanings indicated:
    Reasonably expects. When used with reference to a taxpayer, 
reasonably expects means the taxpayer was not liable for more than 
$50,000 in taxes the previous year and there is no other existing or 
anticipated circumstance known to the taxpayer (such as an increase in 
production capacity) that would cause the taxpayer's liability to 
increase beyond that limit.
    Taxpayer. A taxpayer is a person who is liable for excise tax under 
26 U.S.C. 7652 under the same Employer Identification Number as defined 
in 26 CFR 301.7701-12.
    (2) Semimonthly return period. Except in the case of a taxpayer who 
qualifies for, and chooses to use, quarterly return periods as provided 
in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, all taxpayers must use semimonthly 
return periods for deferred payment of tax. The semimonthly return 
periods shall run from the 1st day through the 15th day of each month, 
and from the 16th day through the last day of each month, except as 
otherwise provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (3) Quarterly return period. Effective January 1, 2006, a taxpayer 
who reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $50,000 in taxes 
imposed by 26 U.S.C. 7652 for the current calendar year, and who was 
liable for not more than $50,000 in such taxes in the preceding calendar 
year, may choose to use a quarterly return period. In such a case the 
last day for payment of tax and filing the return will be the 14th day 
after the last day of the calendar quarter. However, the taxpayer may 
not use the quarterly return period procedure for any portion of the 
calendar year following the first date on which the aggregate amount of 
tax due from the taxpayer during the calendar year exceeds $50,000, and 
any tax which has not been paid on that date will be due on the 14th day 
after the last day of semimonthly period in which that date occurs.
    (c) Filing. (1) The original of TTB Form 5000.25, with remittance 
covering the full amount of the tax, shall be filed with the appropriate 
TTB officer not later than the 14th day after the last day of the return 
period except as provided by paragraph (d) of this section. If the due 
date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the return and 
remittance shall be due on the immediately preceding day which is not a 
Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, except as provided by paragraph (d) 
of this section.
    (2) The tax shall be paid in full by remittance at the time the 
return is filed, unless the proprietor is required to make remittances 
by electronic fund transfer in accordance with Sec. 26.112a.
    (3) The remittance may be in any form that is authorized to be 
accepted under the provisions of Sec. 70.61 of this chapter.
    (4) When the return and remittance are delivered by U.S. mail to the 
office of the appropriate TTB officer, the date of the official postmark 
of the U.S. Postal Service stamped on the cover in which the return and 
remittance were mailed shall be treated as the date of delivery.
    (d) Special September rule for taxes due by semimonthly return. (1) 
General. The second semimonthly period for the month of September shall 
be divided

[[Page 735]]

into two payment periods, from the 16th day through the 26th day, and 
from the 27th day through the 30th day. The taxpayer shall file a return 
on Form 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 16-26, no 
later than September 29. The taxpayer shall file a return on Form 
5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 27-30, no later 
than October 14.
    (2) Taxpayment not by electronic fund transfer. In the case of taxes 
not required to be remitted by electronic fund transfer as prescribed by 
Sec. 26.112a, the second semimonthly period of September shall be 
divided into two payment periods, from the 16th day through the 25th

considered to have met the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, if the amount paid no later than September 29 is not less than 
11/15 (73.3 percent) of the tax liability incurred for the semimonthly 
period beginning on September 1 and ending on September 15, and if any 
underpayment of tax is paid by October 14.

Sunday, the return and remittance shall be due on the immediately 
following day.
    (e) Default. Where a taxpayer has defaulted in any payment of tax 
under this section, during the period of such default and until the

by such taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 26.113. 
During such period, distilled spirits, wine, or beer shall not be

Sec. 26.112a  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.

    (a) General. (1) Each taxpayer who was liable, during a calendar 
year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in 
distilled spirits taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this 
part and parts 19 and 27 of this chapter, a gross amount equal to or 
exceeding five million dollars in wine taxes combining tax liabilities 
incurred under this part and parts 24 and 27 of this chapter, or a gross 
amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in beer taxes 
combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 25 and 27 
of this chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by 
electronic fund transfer (EFT) of such taxes during the succeeding 
calendar year. Payment by cash, check, or money order, of distilled 
spirits taxes, wine taxes, or beer

[[Page 736]]

taxes, as described in Sec. 26.112, is not authorized for a taxpayer 
who is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For 
purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is to be 
summarized separately for distilled spirits taxes, wine taxes, or beer 
taxes, and is defined as the gross tax liability on each type of product 
for which taxes are paid in accordance with this subpart, taxable 
withdrawals from premises in the United States, and importation during 
the calendar year, without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, 
for all premises at which tax liabilities are incurred by the taxpayer. 
Overpayments are not taken into account in summarizing the gross tax 
liability.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and 
implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except 
that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall be replaced by the words 
``more than 50 percent'' in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 
26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the 
rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar 
fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole 
proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a 
group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one 
taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make 
remittances by EFT.
    (3) A taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances 
by EFT, shall make a separate EFT remittance and file a separate tax 
return, for each premises from which distilled spirits, wine, or beer is 
withdrawn upon determination of tax.
    (b) Requirements. (1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, 
except for a taxpayer already remitting the tax by EFT, each taxpayer 
who was liable for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million 
dollars in distilled spirits taxes combining tax liabilities incurred 
under this part and parts 19 and 27 of this chapter, a gross amount 
equal to or exceeding five million dollars in wine taxes combining tax 
liabilities incurred under this part and parts 24 and 27 of this 
chapter, or a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in 
beer taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 
25 and 27 of this chapter during the previous calendar year, shall 
notify, in writing, the appropriate TTB officer. The notice shall be an 
agreement to make remittances by EFT.
    (2) For each return filed in accordance with this part, the taxpayer 
shall direct the taxpayer's bank to make an electronic fund transfer in 
the amount of the taxpayment to the Treasury Account as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section. The request shall be made to the bank 
early enough for the transfer to be made to the Treasury Account by no 
later than the close of business on the last day for filing the return, 
prescribed in Sec. 26.112 or Sec. 26.113. The request shall take into 
account any time limit established by the bank.
    (3) If a taxpayer was liable for less than five million dollars in 
distilled spirits taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this 
part and parts 19 and 27 of this chapter, less than five million dollars 
in wine taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and 
parts 24 and 27 of this chapter, or less than five million dollars in 
beer taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 
25 and 27 of this chapter during the preceding calendar year, the 
taxpayer may choose either to continue remitting the tax as provided in 
this section or to remit the tax with the return as prescribed by Sec. 
26.112. Upon filing the first return on which the taxpayer chooses to 
discontinue remitting the tax by EFT and to begin remitting the tax with 
the tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the appropriate TTB officer by 
attaching a written notification to the tax return, stating that no 
taxes are due by EFT, because the tax liability during the preceding 
calendar year was less than five million dollars, and that the 
remittance shall be filed with the tax return.
    (c) Remittance. (1) Each taxpayer shall show on the tax return, 
information about remitting the tax for that return by EFT and shall 
file the return with the appropriate TTB officer.

[[Page 737]]

    (2) Remittances shall be considered as made when the taxpayment by 
electronic fund transfer is received by the Treasury Account. For 
purposes of this section, a taxpayment by electronic fund transfer shall 
be considered as received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a 
Federal Reserve Bank.
    (3) When the taxpayer directs the bank to effect an electronic fund 
transfer message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any 
transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer, through normal banking 
procedures, will serve as the record of payment, and shall be retained 
as part of required records.
    (d) Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT. The taxpayer is subject to 
a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5684, 6651, or 6656, as applicable, for 
failure to make a taxpayment by EFT on or before the close of business 
on the prescribed last day for filing.
    (e) Procedure. Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will issue to the taxpayer 
an TTB Procedure entitled, Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer. 
This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer is to follow when 
preparing returns and EFT remittances in accordance with this part. The 
U.S. Customs Service will provide the taxpayer with instructions for 
preparing EFT remittances for payments to be made to the U.S. Customs 
Service.

Sec. 26.116  Issuance of permit, Form 487B, and customs inspection.

    If the application has been properly executed and the Secretary, or 
his delegate, finds that all internal revenue taxes imposed under 26 
U.S.C. 7652(a), have been computed under the provisions of this part and 
have been paid or, pursuant to a sufficient bond, have been deferred 
under the applicable provisions of this part, he will execute his permit 
on all copies thereof, retain one copy of the form, return two copies to 
the shipper, and send three copies to the district director of customs 
in Puerto Rico. The shipper will submit the two copies of the Form 487B 
to the district director of customs at least six hours prior to the 
intended lading of the merchandise. The district director of customs 
will then inspect the merchandise covered by the Form 487B after which 
he will execute his certificate on each copy of Form 487B indicating all 
exceptions. If discrepancies appear indicating differences between the 
quantity covered by Form 487B and the quantity actually contained in the 
shipment or the improper tax payment of the merchandise, he will 
withhold release of the shipment and notify the Secretary of such 
discrepancies. Thereupon, such discrepancies must be corrected in the 
shipping documents and additional tax paid, if required, prior to 
release of the merchandise. The district director of customs, upon 
release of the merchandise for shipment, will retain one copy of the 
Form 487B, return two copies to the shipper, and send two copies to the 
district director of customs at the port of arrival in the United 
States, one of which should be mailed and the other dispatched on the 
vessel concerned for the guidance of the appropriate TTB officer who 
will handle the cargo. After the shipment has been cleared by the

one copy of the Form 487B and send one copy thereof, with other shipping 
documents, to the district director of customs at the port of arrival.

Sec. 26.262a  Computation of effective tax rate.

    (a) The proprietor shall compute the effective tax rate for 
distilled spirits containing eligible wine or eligible flavors as the 
ratio of the numerator and denominator as follows:
    (1) The numerator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product 
(exclusive of distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors), 
multipled by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001;
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5041(b) (1), (2), or 
(3), as applicable; and
    (iii) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits derived from 
eligible flavors used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate 
prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001, but only to the extent that such distilled 
spirits exceed 2\1/2\% of the denominator prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section.
    (2) The denominator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product, 
including distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors; and
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by twice the percentage of alcohol by volume of each, divided 
by 100.
    (b) In determining the effective tax rate, quantities of distilled 
spirits, eligible wine, and eligible flavors will be expressed to the 
nearest tenth of a proof gallon. The effective tax rate may be rounded 
to as many decimal places as the proprietor deems appropriate, provided 
that, such rate is expressed no less exactly than the rate rounded to 
the nearest whole cent, and the effective tax rates for all products 
will be consistently expressed to the same number of decimal places. In 
such case, if the number is less than five it will be dropped; if it is 
five or over, a unit will be added.
    (c) The following is an example of the use of the formula.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Proof gallons by which distilled spirits derived from eligible 
flavors exceed 2\1/2\% of the total proof gallons in the batch (100.9-
(2\1/2\%)x3,371.8=16.6).

                              Batch Record
Distilled spirits.........................  2249.1 proof gallons.
Eligible wine (14% alcohol by volume).....  2265.0 wine gallons.
Eligible wine (19% alcohol by volume).....  1020.0 wine gallons.
Eligible flavors..........................  100.9 proof gallons.

Sec. 26.267  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.

    (a) Each person bringing liquors and articles into the United States 
from the Virgin Islands who was liable, during a calendar year, for a 
gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in distilled 
spirits taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and 
parts 19 and 27 of this chapter, a gross amount equal to or exceeding 
five million dollars in wine taxes combining tax liabilities incurred 
under this part and parts 24 and 27 of this chapter, or a gross amount 
equal to or exceeding five million dollars in beer taxes combining tax 
liabilities incurred under this part and parts 25 and 27 of this 
chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic 
fund transfer (EFT), as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, of 
such taxes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of such taxes by 
cash, check, or money order is not authorized for a person bringing 
liquors and articles into the United States from the Virgin Islands who 
is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For purposes 
of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is to be summarized 
separately for distilled spirits taxes, wine taxes, or beer taxes, and 
is defined as the gross tax liability on all taxable withdrawals from 
premises in the United States and importations (including products of 
the same tax class brought into the United States from Puerto Rico or 
the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, without regard to any 
drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such 
activities are conducted.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, a ``person'' includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and 
implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except 
that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall be replaced by the words 
``more than 50 percent'' in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 
26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the 
rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar 
fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole 
proprietorships. If one entity maintains more

[[Page 755]]

than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or 
more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of 
the controlled group are one person for the purpose of determining who 
is required to make remittances by EFT.
    (c) Electronic fund transfer or EFT means any transfer of funds, 
other than a transaction originated by check, draft, or similar paper 
instrument, which is initiated through an electronic terminal, 
telephonic instrument, or computer of magnetic tape, so as to order, 
instruct, or authorize a financial institution to either debit or credit 
an account, in accordance with procedures established by the U.S. 
Customs Service.
    (d) Each person who is required by this section to make remittances 
by EFT shall make the EFT remittance in accordance with the requirements 
of the U.S. Customs Service.

    (a) A tax is imposed on all distilled spirits in customs bonded 
warehouses or imported into the United States at the rate prescribed by

exceed 2\1/2\ percent of the finished product on a proof gallon basis. 
The credit is allowable at the time the tax is payable as if it 
constituted a reduction in the rate of tax.

the tax shall establish an effective tax rate in accordance with Sec. 
27.41. The effective tax rate established will be applied to each entry.

Sec. 27.41  Computation of effective tax rate.

    (a) The proprietor shall compute the effective tax rate for 
distilled spirits containing eligible wine or eligible flavors as the 
ratio of the numerator and denominator as follows:
    (1) The numerator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product 
(exclusive of distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors), 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001;
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5041(b)(1), (2), or 
(3), as applicable; and
    (iii) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits derived from 
eligible flavors used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate 
prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001, but only to the extent that such distilled 
spirits exceed 2\1/2\% of the denominator prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section.
    (2) The denominator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product, 
including distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors; and
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by twice the percentage of alcohol by volume of each, divided 
by 100.
    (b) In determining the effective tax rate, quantities of distilled 
spirits, eligible wine, and eligible flavors will be expressed to the 
nearest tenth of a proof gallon. The effective tax rate may be rounded 
to as many decimal places as the proprietor deems appropriate, provided 
that, such rate is expressed no less exactly than the rate rounded to 
the nearest whole cent, and the effective tax rates for all products 
will be consistently expressed to the same number of decimal places. In 
such

[[Page 769]]

case, if the number is less than five it will be dropped; if it is five 
or over, a unit will be added.
    (c) The following is an example of the use of the formula.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Proof gallons by which distilled spirits derived from eligible 
flavors exceed 2\1/2\% of the total proof gallons in the batch (100.9 -

limitation, not to exceed 0.009 gram of carbon dioxide per 100 
milliliters of wine, will be allowed where the amount of carbon dioxide 
in excess of 0.392 gram per 100 milliliters of wine was due to 
mechanical variations which could not be completely controlled under 
good commercial practices. Such tolerance will not be allowed where it 
is found that the limitation of 0.392 gram of carbon dioxide per 100 
milliliters of wine is continuously or intentionally exceeded.

the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, without regard to any 
drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such 
activities are conducted by the taxpayer.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and 
implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except 
that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall be replaced by the words 
``more than 50 percent'' in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 
26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the 
rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar 
fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole 
proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a 
group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one 
taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make 
remittances by EFT.
    (c) Electronic fund transfer or EFT means any transfer of funds, 
other than a transaction originated by check, draft, or similar paper 
instrument, which is initiated through an electronic terminal, 
telephonic instrument, or computer of magnetic tape, so as to order, 
instruct, or authorize a financial institution to either debit or credit 
an account, in accordance with procedures established by the U.S. 
Customs Service.
    (d) An importer who is required by this section to make remittances 
by EFT shall make the EFT remittance in accordance with the requirements 
of the U.S. Customs Service.

by the appropriate TTB officer. The importer shall file or furnish a 
copy of the standard effective tax rate approval in the manner 
prescribed in Sec. 27.76(d). The use of a standard effective tax rate 
shall not relieve an importer from the payment of any tax found to be 
due. The appropriate TTB officer may at any time require an importer to 
immediately discontinue the use of a standard effective tax rate.

grapes or other sound, ripe fruit (including berries) made with any 
cellar treatment authorized by subparts F and L of part 24 of this 
chapter and containing not more than 21 percent by weight (21 degrees 
Brix de-alcoholized wine) of total solids.
    Produced, when used with reference to wine, means removed from the 
fermenter.
    Proper cellar treatment means a production practice or procedure 
authorized by subparts F and L of part 24 of this chapter and, in the 
case of natural wine produced and imported subject to an international 
agreement or treaty, those practices and procedures acceptable to the 
United States under that agreement or treaty.
    (b) Certification--(1) General. Except as otherwise provided in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an importer of natural wine must have 
an original or copy of a certification from the producing country 
stating that the practices and procedures used to produce the imported 
wine constitute proper cellar treatment. The certification:
    (i) Must be from a governmental or government-approved entity having 
oversight or control over enological practices in the producing country 
under the laws of that country;
    (ii) Must include the results of a laboratory analysis of the wine 
conducted either by a government laboratory of the producing country or 
by a laboratory certified by the government of the producing country; 
and
    (iii) Must be in the possession of the importer at the time of 
release of the wine from customs custody and may cover multiple 
importations provided that the wine in each case is of the same brand 
and class or type, was made by the same producer, was subjected to the 
same cellar treatment, and conforms to the statements made on the 
certification.
    (2) Alternative certifications and exemptions--(i) The following are 
alternatives to the producing country certification and laboratory 
analysis requirement described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section:
    (A) In the case of natural wine produced and imported subject to an 
international agreement or treaty specifying that the practices and 
procedures used to produce the wine are acceptable to the United States, 
no producing country certification and laboratory analysis is required, 
unless that international agreement or treaty requires

[[Page 778]]

a certification, in which case the importer must have in his or her 
possession at the time of release of the wine from customs custody an 
original or copy of that certification.
    (B) If an importer of natural wine or its affiliate owns or controls 
a winery operating under a basic permit issued under part 1 of this 
chapter, in lieu of a producing country certification and laboratory 
analysis, the importer may self-certify that the practices and 
procedures used to produce the wine constitute proper cellar treatment. 
The self-certification must be either in the format set forth in 
paragraph (c) of this section with blocks 1 through 4 completed or in an 
alternative format that sets forth the same information, and it must be 
in the possession of the importer at the time of release of the wine 
from customs custody. In the case of self-certification the importer 
also must have at the time of release from customs custody records to 
establish that the requirements for self-certification are met.
    (ii) The following are exempt from any certification requirement 
under this section:
    (A) Natural wine produced before January 1, 2005. However, in this 
case, the importer must have in his or her possession at the time of 
release of the wine from customs custody records to establish that the 
wine was produced before January 1, 2005.
    (B) Importations of natural wine that are of a personal, non-
commercial nature. Examples of non-commercial importations include 
importations by travelers, gift shipments between individuals, and 
importations by diplomats for embassy or consular use.
    (C) Importations of natural wine that constitute commercial samples. 
Commercial samples include sales samples, samples for trade shows, and 
samples for laboratory analysis.
    (D) Imported natural wine held on board international passenger 
carriers, such as cruise ships or airliners.
    (c) Form. The format for certification referred to in paragraph (b) 
of this section is the following:

[[Page 779]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR24AU05.000

    (d) Preparation of Certification. The following rules apply for the 
completion of the certification set forth in paragraph (c) of this 
section:
    (1) Block 1 must state the legal name and address (including 
country) of the producer of the wine.

[[Page 780]]

    (2) Block 2 must include a complete description of the wine, 
including its brand name, year of production, class or type, and country 
of origin.
    (3) The importer must check the applicable box in block 3:
    (i) The importer must check box 3a and ensure that blocks 4 and 5 
are completed if no alternative certification applies to the wine under 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) applies to the wine, the importer 
must check box 3b and complete the certification in block 4.
    (4) If the certification is submitted subsequent to approval of a 
label, the importer must complete block 6 by including the TTB 
identification number from the certificate of label approval, TTB Form 
5100.31.

                   Premises of Distilled Spirits Plant


<R05>
Sec. 27.171  General provisions.

    Imported distilled spirits in bulk containers may, under the 
provisions of this subpart, be withdrawn by the proprietor of a 
distilled spirits plant from customs custody and transferred in such 
bulk containers or by pipeline to the bonded premises of his plant, 
without payment of the internal revenue tax imposed on imported spirits 
by 26 U.S.C. 5001. Imported spirits so withdrawn and transferred to a 
distilled spirits plant (a) may be redistilled or denatured only if of 
185 degrees or more of proof, and (b) may be withdrawn from internal 
revenue bond for any purpose authorized by 26 U.S.C. chapter 51, in the 
same manner as domestic distilled spirits. Imported distilled spirits 
transferred from customs custody to the bonded premises of a distilled 
spirits plant under the provisions of this subpart shall be received and 
stored thereat, and withdrawn or transferred therefrom, subject to the 
applicable provisions of 27 CFR part 19. However, distilled spirits 
plant proprietors are not required to file application on TTB Form 
5100.16 to receive imported spirits from customs custody. The person 
operating the bonded premises of the distilled spirits plant to which 
imported spirits are transferred shall become liable for the tax on 
distilled spirits withdrawn from customs custody under 26 U.S.C. 5232, 
upon release of the spirits from customs custody, and the importer shall 
thereupon be relieved of his liability for such tax.

    The person importing spirits under this subpart shall prepare a 
transfer record according to Sec. 27.138. A separate transfer record 
shall be prepared for each conveyance. If the spirits are in packages he 
shall prepare a package gauge record according to Sec. 27.139 and 
attach it to the transfer record. The transfer record and the package 
gauge record shall be prepared in triplicate, and, upon release of the 
spirits from customs custody one copy will be given to the customs 
officer, one copy will be forwarded to the appropriate TTB officer, and 
the original will be forwarded to the consignee.

Sec. 27.173  Inspection and release.

    The customs officer shall not release distilled spirits under this 
subpart until he inspects the spirits. If it appears that losses in 
transit were sustained from any container, the customs officer shall 
gauge the spirits in such container and enter the elements of gauge on 
the transfer record if the spirits are in a bulk conveyance or on the 
package gauge record if the spirits are in packages. The customs officer 
shall enter on the transfer record the port of entry, carrier 
identification, warehouse entry number, applicable rate of duty, and 
serial number of any customs seals affixed to bulk conveyances. When all

[[Page 781]]

customs requirements are complied with, he shall release the spirits for 
transfer to the distilled spirits plant by dating and signing on the 
transfer with his title the statement: ``To the best of my knowledge the 
information hereon is accurate and the spirits are released.'' The 
original of the transfer record with any attachments shall be retained 
by the consignee.

under this part and part 22 of this chapter, Form 5150.33 may be 
annotated to cover both types of withdrawals.
    (3) A separate permit is not required for each port of entry. The 
application, Form 5150.33, may be completed to indicate the applicable

    (4) A Government agency may specify on its application that it 
desires a single permit authorizing all sub-agencies under its control 
to procure and withdraw spirits free of tax under this subpart and 
subpart N of part 22 of this chapter; or, each Government location may 
individually file an application for a permit, Form 5150.33.
    (5) Each application for a permit shall be signed by the head of the 
agency or sub-agency, or the incumbent of an office which is authorized 
by the head of the agency or sub-agency, to sign. Evidence of 
authorization to sign on behalf of the head of an agency or

    (a) Application. An importer who desires to use an alternate method 
or procedure in lieu of a method or procedure prescribed by this part 
must file an application, in triplicate, with the appropriate TTB 
officer. Each application must:
    (1) Specify the name, address, and permit number of the importer to 
which it relates;

procedure is received, the appropriate TTB officer must determine 
whether approval thereof would unduly hinder the effective 
administration of this part or would result in jeopardy to the revenue. 
The appropriate TTB officer may approve the alternate method or 
procedure if such officer finds that:
    (1) Good cause has been shown for the use of the alternate method or 
procedure;
    (2) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and 
consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed 
method or procedure, and affords equivalent security to the revenue; and
    (3) The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any 
provision of law, and will not result in an increase in cost to the 
Government or hinder the effective administration of this part.

No alternate method or procedure shall be used until approval has been 
received from the appropriate TTB officer. Authorization for the 
alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment 
of the appropriate TTB officer, the revenue is jeopardized or the 
effective administration of this part is hindered by the continuation of 
such authorization.

Sec. 28.22  Vessels employed in the fisheries.

    Liquors may be withdrawn or laden under the provisions of paragraphs 
(b) and (e) of Sec. 28.21 relating to vessels employed in the 
fisheries, only for use on vessels of the United States documented to 
engage in the fisheries and foreign fishing vessels of 5 net tons or 
over if the district director of customs is satisfied by reason of the 
quantity requested in the light of (a) whether the vessel is employed in 
substantially continuous fishing activities, and (b) the vessel's 
complement, that none of the liquors to be withdrawn or laden are 
intended to be removed from the vessel in, or otherwise returned to, the 
United States. Such withdrawal or lading shall be conditioned upon 
compliance with the applicable provisions of this part. Lading of such 
liquors for use on such vessels shall be subject to approval by the 
district director of customs of a special written application by the 
withdrawer or the vessel's master on customs Form 5125 (in duplicate) 
and a statement by the withdrawer in his application or notice on the 
required TTB Form 5100.11, 5110.30, 1582-A (5120.24), 1582-B (5130.6), 
or 1689 (5130.12), as the case may be, that the liquors are

[[Page 792]]

to be laden for use as supplies on a vessel employed in the fisheries. 
The original application on customs Form 5125, after approval, shall be 
stamped with the serial number of the TTB Form 5100.11, 5110.30, 1582-A 
(5120.24), 1582-B (5130.6), or 1689 (5130.12), as the case may be, and 
the date thereof, and shall be returned by the district director of 
customs to the withdrawer or vessel's master for use as prescribed 
below. Approval of each such application shall be subject to the 
condition that the original shall be presented thereafter by the 
withdrawer or the vessel's master to the district director of customs 
within 24 hours (excluding Saturday, Sunday, and holidays) after each 
subsequent arrival of the vessel at a customs port or station and that 
an accounting shall be made at the time of such presentation of the 
disposition of the liquors until the district director of customs is 
satisfied that they have been consumed on board, or landed under customs 
supervision, and takes up the authorization. The approval of customs 
Form 5125 shall be subject to the further condition that any such 
liquors remaining on board while the vessel is in port shall be 
safeguarded in the manner and to such extent as the director of the port 
or place of arrival shall deem necessary. When such liquors have been 
accounted for to the satisfaction of the district director of customs, 
he shall execute his certificate of lading and use on both copies of the 
TTB Form 5100.11, 5110.30, 1582-A (5120.24), 1582-B (5130.6), or 1689 
(5130.12), as the case may be, and forward the original of the form 
according to its instructions. In the event of a failure on the part of 
the withdrawer or the master of the vessel to comply with the conditions 
of this section or upon receipt of evidence that the liquors were not 
lawfully used as supplies on the vessel, the district director of 
customs shall advise the appropriate TTB officer of all the facts in the 
case for determination of any liability incurred. In the case of liquors 
withdrawn without payment of tax, assessment of tax liability found to 
have been incurred shall be made against the principal on the bond. In 
the case of taxpaid or tax determined liquors, the appropriate TTB 
officer shall determine as to whether to make demand upon the principal 
and the surety on the bond or to disallow the claim as the case may be.
    Note: As used in this section, the word ``withdrawer'' shall mean 
the person executing the application or notice, TTB Form 5100.11,

and engaged in foreign trade, privileges substantially reciprocal to the 
privileges allowed herein to aircraft of a foreign country. Where 
application is made to withdraw or lade liquors for use on aircraft of 
other countries, which it is claimed reciprocate similar privileges to 
aircraft of the United States, the applicant must first establish the 
right of such withdrawal or lading. In appropriate cases, the applicant 
should request the Secretary of Commerce to find and advise the 
Secretary of the Treasury that such foreign country or countries allow, 
or will allow, substantially reciprocal privileges to aircraft of the 
United States.

the liquor is insured, the application shall show its market value, the 
amount and date of each and every policy of insurance, the name and 
location of the company by which each and every policy was issued, the 
name and address of the bona fide owner of the liquor, and to the best

containers, the serial numbers of the containers (if any), and the 
quantity received, and shall show that the liquors are in customs 
custody and have been or will be laden on board the vessel or aircraft, 
that they will be lawfully used on board the vessel or aircraft, and 
that no portion of the shipment has been or will be unladen in the 
United States or any of its territories or possessions. A receipt is not

                     Subpart A_Scope of Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 30.1  Gauging of distilled spirits.

    (a) General. This part relates to the gauging of distilled spirits. 
The term ``gauging'' means the determination of the proof and the 
quantity of distilled spirits. The procedures prescribed in or 
authorized under the provisions of this part, except as may be otherwise 
authorized in this chapter, shall be followed in making any 
determination of quantity or proof of distilled spirits required by or 
under the authority of regulations in this chapter. The tables referred 
to in subpart E of this part appear in the ``Gauging Manual Embracing 
Instructions and Tables for Determining Quantity of Distilled Spirits by 
Proof and Weight'' as incorporated by reference in this part (see 
paragraph (c) of this section). These tables, together with their 
instructions, shall be used, wherever applicable, in making the 
necessary computations from gauge data.

[[Page 837]]

    (b) Tables referred to in subpart E of this part. Table 1 provides a 
method of correcting hydrometer indications at temperatures between 0 
and 100 degrees Fahrenheit to true proof. If distilled spirits contain 
dissolved solids, temperature correction of the hydrometer reading by 
the use of this table would result in apparent proof rather than true 
proof. Tables 2 and 3 show the gallonage of spirituous liquor according 
to weight and proof. Table 4 shows the gallons per pound at each one-
tenth proof from 1 to 200 proof. Table 5 shows the weight per wine 
gallon and proof gallon at each proof. Table 6 shows the volumes of 
alcohol and water and the specific gravity (air and vacuum) of 
spirituous liquor at each proof. Table 7 provides a means of 
ascertaining the volume (at 60 degree Fahrenheit) of spirits at various 
temperatures ranging from 18 degrees through 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
    (c) Incorporation by reference. The ``Gauging Manual Embracing 
Instructions and Tables for Determining Quantity of Distilled Spirits by 
Proof and Weight'' (Publication 5110.6; November 1978) is incorporated 
by reference in this part. This incorporation by reference was approved 
by the Director of the Federal Register on March 23, 1981. This 
publication may be inspected at the National Archives and Records 
Administration (NARA), and is available from the Superintendent of

Sec. 30.22  Hydrometers and thermometers.

    The hydrometers used are graduated to read the proof of aqueous 
alcoholic solutions at 60 degrees Fahrenheit; thus, they read, 0 for 
water, 100 for proof spirits, and 200 for absolute alcohol. Because of 
temperature-density relationships and the selection of 60 degrees 
Fahrenheit for reporting proof, the hydrometer readings will be less 
than the true percent of proof at temperatures below 60 degrees 
Fahrenheit and greater than the true percent of proof at temperatures 
above 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Hence, corrections are necessary for 
hydrometer readings at temperatures other than 60 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Precision hydrometers shall be used for gauging spirits. Hydrometers and 
thermometers shall be used and the true percent of proof shall be 
determined in accordance with Sec. 30.31. Hydrometers are designated by 
letter according to range of proof and are provided in ranges and 
subdivisions of stems as follows:

Sec. 30.23  Use of precision hydrometers and thermometers.

    Care should be exercised to obtain accurate hydrometer and 
thermometer readings. In order to accomplish this result, the following 
precautions should be observed. Bulk spirits should be thoroughly 
agitated so that the test samples will be representative of the entire 
quantity. The hydrometers should be kept clean and free of any oily 
substance. Immediately before readings are taken, the glass cylinder 
containing the thermometer should be rinsed several times with the 
spirits which are to be gauged so as to bring both the cylinder and the 
thermometer to the temperature of the spirits (if time permits, it is 
desirable to bring both the spirits and the instruments to room 
temperature). If the outer surface of the cylinder becomes wet, it 
should be wiped dry to avoid the cooling effect of rapid evaporation. 
During the readings the cylinder should be protected from drafts or 
other conditions which might affect its temperature or that of the 
spirits which it contains. The hands should not be placed on the 
cylinder in such a manner as to warm the liquid contained therein. The 
hydrometer should be inserted in the liquid and the hydrometer bulb 
raised and lowered from top to bottom 5 or 6 times to obtain an even 
temperature distribution over its surface, and, while the hydrometer 
bulb remains in the liquid, the stem should be dried and the hydrometer 
allowed to come to rest without wetting more than a few tenths degrees 
of the exposed stem. Special care should be taken to ascertain the exact 
point at which the level of the surface liquid intersects the scale of 
proof in the stem of the hydrometer. The hydrometer and thermometer 
should be immediately read, as nearly simultaneously as possible. In 
reading the hydrometer, a sighting should be made slightly below the 
plane of the surface of the liquid and the line of sight should then be 
raised slowly, being kept perpendicular to the hydrometer stem, until 
the appearance of the surface changes from an ellipse to a straight 
line. The point where this line intersects the hydrometer scale is the 
correct reading of the hydrometer. When the correct readings of the 
hydrometer and the thermometer have been determined, the true percent of 
proof shall be ascertained from Table 1. Another sample of the spirits 
should then be taken and be tested in the same manner so as to verify 
the proof originally ascertained. Hydrometer readings should be made to 
the nearest 0.05 degree and thermometer readings should be made to the 
nearest 0.1 degree, and instrument correction factors, if any, should be 
applied. It is necessary to interpolate in Table 1 for fractional 
hydrometer and thermometer readings.

    Example. A hydrometer reads 192.85[deg] at 72.10 [deg]F. The 
correction factors for the hydrometer and the thermometer, respectively 
are minus0.03[deg] and plus0.05[deg]. The corrected reading, then, is 
192.82[deg] at 72.15 [deg]F.

From Table 1:
193.0[deg] at 72.0 [deg]F.                                   =  190.2[de

192.0[deg] at 72.0 [deg]F.                                   =  189.1[de
                                                                      g]
                                                           -------------
    Difference                                               =  1.1[deg]
192.0[deg] at 72.0 [deg]F.                                   =  189.1[de
                                                                      g]
192.0[deg] at 73.0 [deg]F.                                   =  188.9[de
                                                                      g]
                                                           -------------
    Difference                                               =  0.2[deg]
 

    The hydrometer difference (1.1[deg]) multiplied by the fractional 
degree of the hydrometer reading (0.82[deg])=0.902.
    The temperature difference (0.2[deg]) multiplied by the fractional 
degree of the temperature reading (0.15[deg])=0.03[deg].
Proof at 60 [deg]F.=189.1+0.902-0.03=189.972[deg]=190.0[deg].
    As shown, the final proof is rounded to the nearest tenth of a 
degree of proof. In such cases, if the hundredths decimal is less than 
five, it will be dropped; if it is five or over, a unit will be added.

Sec. 30.25  Use of precision specific gravity hydrometers.

    The provisions of Sec. 30.23 respecting the care, handling, and use 
of precision instruments shall be followed with respect to the care, 
handling, and use of precision grade specific gravity hydrometers. 
Specific gravity hydrometers shall be read to the nearest subdivision. 
Because of temperature density relationships and the selection of the 
standardization temperature of 60 [deg]/60 [deg]F., the specific gravity 
readings will be greater at temperatures below 60 degrees Fahrenheit and 
less at temperatures above 60 degress Fahrenheit. Hence, correction of 
the specific gravity readings will be made for temperature other than 60 
degrees Fahrenheit. Such correction may be ascertained by dividing the 
specific gravity hydrometer reading by the applicable correction factor 
in Table 7.

    Example: The specific gravity hydrometer reading is 1.1525, the 
thermometer reading is 68 degrees Fahrenheit, and the true proof of the 
spirits is 115 degrees. The correct specific gravity reading will be 
ascertained as follows:
    (a) From Table 7, the correction factor for 115[deg] proof at 68 
[deg]F. is 0.996.
    (b) 1.1525 divided by 0.996=1.1571, the corrected specific gravity.

Sec. 30.31  Determination of proof.

    (a) General. The proof of spirits shall be determined to the nearest 
tenth degree which shall be the proof used in determining the proof 
gallons.
    (b) Solids content not more than 600 milligrams. Except as otherwise 
authorized by the appropriate TTB officer, the proof of spirits 
containing not more than 600 milligrams of solids per 100 milliliters of 
spirits shall be determined by the use of a hydrometer and thermometer 
in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 30.23 except that if such 
spirits contain solids in excess of 400 milligrams but not in excess of 
600 milligrams per 100 milliliters at gauge proof, there shall be added 
to the proof so determined the obscuration determined as prescribed in 
Sec. 30.32.
    (c) Solids content over 600 milligrams. If such spirits contain 
solids in excess of 600 milligrams per 100 milliliters at gauge proof, 
the proof shall be determined on the basis of true proof determined as 
follows:
    (1) By the use of a hydrometer and a thermometer after the spirits 
have been distilled in a small laboratory still and restored to the 
original volume and temperature by the addition of pure water to the 
distillate; or
    (2) By a recognized laboratory method which is equal or superior in 
accuracy to the distillation method.

[[Page 841]]

    (d) Initial proof. Except when the proof of spirits is used in 
making the guage prescribed in 27 CFR 19.383 or in making a gauge for 
determination of tax, the initial determination of proof made on the 
bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant for such spirits may be 
used whenever a subsequent gauge is required to be made at that same 
plant provided that no material has been added to change the proof of 
the spirits.

Sec. 30.32  Determination of proof obscuration.

    (a) General. Proof obscuration of spirits containing more than 400 
but not more than 600 milligrams of solids per 100 milliliters shall be 
determined by one of the following methods. The evaporation method may 
be used only for spirits in the range of 80-100 degrees at gauge proof.
    (b) Evaporation method. Evaporate the water and alcohol from a 
carefully measured 25 milliliter sample of spirits, dry the residue at 
100 degrees centigrade for 30 minutes and then weigh the residue 
precisely. Multiply the weight of the residue by 4 to determine the 
weight of solids in 100 milliliters. The resulting weight per 100 
milliliters multiplied by 4 will give the obscuration. Experience has 
shown that 0.1 gram (100 milligrams) of solids per 100 milliliters of 
spirits in the range of 80-100 degrees proof will obscure the true proof 
by 0.4 of one degree of proof. For example, if the weight of solids 
remaining after evaporation of 25 milliliters 0.125 gram, the amount of 
solids present in 100 milliliters of the spirits is 0.50 gram (4 times 
0.125). The obscuration is 4 times 0.50, which is two degrees of proof. 
This value added to the temperature corrected hydrometer reading will 
give the true proof.
    (c) Distillation method. Determine the apparent proof and 
temperature of the sample of spirits and then distill a carefully 
measured sample in a small laboratory still, and collect a quantity of 
the distillate, 1 or 2 milliliters less than the original sample. The 
distillate is adjusted to the original temperature and restored to the 
original volume by addition of distilled water. The proof of the 
restored distillate is then determined by use of a precision hydrometer 
and thermometer in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 13.23 to the 
nearest 0.1 degree of proof. The difference between the proof so 
determined and the apparent proof of the undistilled sample is the 
obscuration; or
    (d) Pycnometer method. Determine the specific gravity of the 
undistilled sample, distill and restore the samples as provided in 
paragraph (c) of this section and determine the specific gravity of the 
restored distillate by means of a pycnometer. The specific gravities so 
obtained will be converted to degrees of proof by interpolation of Table 
6 to the nearest 0.1 degree of proof. The difference in proof so 
obtained is the obscuration.

<R05>
Sec. 30.41  Bulk spirits.

    When spirits (including denatured spirits) are to be gauged by 
weight in bulk quantities, the weight shall be determined by means of 
weighing tanks, mounted on accurate scales. Before each use, the scales 
shall be balanced

[[Page 842]]

at zero load; thereupon the spirits shall be run into the weighing tank 
and proofed as prescribed in Sec. 30.31. However, if the spirits are to 
be reduced in proof, the spirits shall be so reduced before final 
determination of the proof. The scales shall then be brought to a 
balanced condition and the weight of the spirits determined by reading 
the beam to the nearest graduation mark. From the weight and the proof 
thus ascertained, the quantity of the spirits in proof gallons shall be 
determined by reference to Table 4. However, in the case of spirits 
which contain solids in excess of 600 milligrams per 100 milliliters, 
the quantity in proof gallons shall be determined by first ascertaining 
the wine gallons per pound of the spirits and multiplying the wine 
gallons per pound by the weight, in pounds, of the spirits being gauged 
and by the true proof (determined as prescribed in Sec. 30.31) and 
dividing the result by 100. The wine gallons per pound of spirits 
containing solids in excess of 600 milligrams per 100 milliliters shall 
be ascertained by:
    (a) Use of a precision hydrometer and thermometer, in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 30.23, to determine the apparent proof of 
the spirits (if specific gravity at the temperature of the spirits is 
not more than 1.0) and reference to Table 4 for the wine gallons per 
pound, or
    (b) Use of a specific gravity hydrometer, in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 30.25, to determine the specific gravity of the 
spirits (if the specific gravity at the temperature of the spirits is 
more than 1.0) and dividing that specific gravity (corrected to 60 
degrees Fahrenheit) into the factor 0.120074 (the wine gallons per pound 
for water at 60 degrees Fahrenheit). When withdrawing a portion of the 
contents of a weighing tank, the difference between the quantity 
(ascertained by proofing and weighing) in the tank immediately before 
the removal of the spirits and the quantity (ascertained by proofing and 
weighing) in the tank immediately after the removal of the spirits shall 
be the quantity considered to be withdrawn.

<R05>
Sec. 30.42  Denatured spirits.

    The quantity, in gallons, of any lot or package of specially 
denatured spirits may be determined by weighing it and then dividing its 
weight by the weight per gallon of the formula concerned, as given in 
the appropriate tables in subpart H of 27 CFR Part 21. In the case of 
completely denatured spirits, the gallonage of any lot or package may be 
ascertained by determining its weight and apparent proof (hydrometer 
indication, corrected to 60 degrees Fahrenheit) and then multiplying the 
weight of the wine gallons per pound factor shown in Table 4 for the 
(apparent) proof.

<R05>
Sec. 30.43  Packaged spirits.

    When the quantity of spirits (including denatured spirits when 
gauged by weight) in packages, such as barrels, drums, and similar 
portable containers, is to be determined by gauge of the individual 
packages, such quantity shall, except as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section, be determined by weighing each package on an accurate 
weighing beam or platform scale having a beam or dial showing weight in 
pounds and half pounds, where packages having a capacity in excess of 10 
wine gallons are to be gauged, or in pounds and ounces, or pounds and 
hundredths of a pound, where packages designed to hold 10 wine gallons 
or less are to be gauged. In either case the tare must be determined and 
subtracted from the gross weight to obtain the net weight. From the 
proof and weight ascertained, the quantity of the spirits in proof 
gallons shall be determined by reference to Table 2, 3, or 4. However, 
if the spirits contain solids in excess of 600 milligrams per 100 
milliliters, the proof gallons shall be determined as prescribed for 
such spirits in Sec. 30.41. Notwithstanding the provisions of this 
section or of Sec. 30.44, (a) gross weights and tares of packages being 
filled need not be taken in any case where the gauge of the spirits is 
not derived from such weights under the gauging procedure being 
utilized, and (b) meters, other devices, or other methods may be used 
for determining the quantity of spirits

in individual packages, when such meter is used as provided in 27 CFR 
Part 19, or, when such other device or method has been approved by the

    (c) Containers of other proofs or sizes. Where containers of proofs 
or sizes not shown above are to be filled, the following rule may be 
used for ascertaining the weight of the spirits to be placed in the 
container: Divide the number of gallons representing the quantity of 
spirits to be placed in the container by the fractional part of a gallon 
equivalent to 1 pound, to obtain the weight of the spirits in pounds and 
fractions of a pound to two decimal places. Reduce the decimal fraction 
of a pound to ounces by multiplying by 16, calling any fraction of an 
ounce a whole ounce. The pounds and ounces thus obtained will determine 
the point to which the spirits must be weighed to produce the results 
desired. If the weight must be marked on the container in pounds and 
decimal fractions of a pound, it will be necessary to convert the ounces 
to hundredths of a pound. The fraction of a gallon equivalent to 1 pound 
at any given proof shall be ascertained by reference to Table 4. 
However, if the spirits contain solids in excess of 600 milligrams per 
100 milliliters, the fraction of a gallon equivalent to 1 pound shall be 
determined as prescribed for such spirits in Sec. 30.41.

    Example. It is desired to fill a 1-gallon can with precisely 1 wine 
gallon of 194 proof spirits:
1.00 divided by 0.14866=6.73 pounds.
0.73 multiplied by 16=11.68 ounces, rounded to 12 ounces.
Weight of spirits--6 pounds, 12 ounces.
Weight, if required, to be marked on can-6.75 pounds.

<R05>
Sec. 30.45  Withdrawal gauge for packages.

    When wooden packages are to be individually gauged for withdrawal, 
actual tare of the packages shall be determined. The actual tare of a 
package shall be determined by weighing it after its contents (including 
rinse water, if any) have been temporarily removed to a separate 
container or vessel. Where the contents of packages have been 
temporarily removed for determination of tare, the proof, if any rinse 
water is added to the spirits, shall be determined after a thorough 
mixing of the rinse water and the spirits and before return of the 
spirits to the rinsed packages, and the gross weight shall be determined 
after the spirits and any added rinse water have been returned to the 
packages. In the

[[Page 844]]

case of metal packages the tare established at the time of filling may 
be used unless it appears to be incorrect. From the proofs and the net 
weights of the packages, the wine gallons (if desired) and the proof 
gallons of spirits shall be determined by the use of Table 2. However, 
if the spirits contain solids in excess of 600 milligrams per 100 
milliliters, the wine gallon and proof gallon contents shall be 
determined as prescribed for such spirits in Sec. 30.41. If either the 
weight or the proof is beyond the limitations of table 2, either table 3 
or table 4 may be used.

                   Determination of Quantity by Volume


<R05>
Sec. 30.51  Procedures for measurement of bulk spirits.

    Where the quantity of spirits (including denatured spirits) in bulk 
is to be determined by volume as authorized by this chapter, the 
measurement shall be made in tanks, by meters as provided in 27 CFR part 
19, or by other devices or methods authorized by the appropriate TTB 
officer, or as otherwise provided in this chapter, or such measurement 
may be made in tank cars or tank trucks if calibration charts for such 
conveyances are provided and such charts have been accurately prepared, 
and certified as accurate, by engineers or other persons qualified to 
calibrate such conveyances. Volumetric measurements in tanks shall be 
made only in accurately calibrated tanks equipped with suitable 
measuring devices, whereby the actual contents can be correctly 
ascertained. If the temperature of spirits (including denatured spirits) 
is other than the standard of 60 degrees Fahrenheit, gallonage 
determined by volumetric measurements shall be corrected to the standard 
temperature by means of table 7. In the case of denatured spirits, the 
temperature-correction factor for the proof of the spirits used in 
denaturation will give sufficiently accurate results, except that the 
temperature-correction factor used for specially denatured spirits, 
Formula No. 18, should be that given in table 7 for 100 proof spirits. 
When the quantity of spirits, in wine gallons, has been determined by 
volumetric measurement, the number of proof gallons shall be obtained by 
multiplying the wine gallons by the proof of the spirits as determined 
under Sec. 30.31.

    Example. Gauge glass reading inches--88.
Wine gallons per inch--48.96.
Temperature [deg]F--72.
Proof of spirits--86.8.
Temperature correction factor (Table 7)--0.995.
48.96 W.G.x88=4308.48 wine gallons.
4308.48 W.G.x0.995=4286.94 wine gallons.
4286.94 W.G.x0.868=3721.06392=3721.1 proof gallons.

<R05>
Sec. 30.52  Procedure for measurement of cased spirits.

    Where the quantity of spirits in a case is to be determined by 
volume, such determination shall be made by ascertaining the contents of 
one bottle in the case and multiplying that figure by the number of 
bottles in the case. For cases containing bottles filled according to 
the metric system of measure, the quantity determined shall be converted 
to wine gallons, as provided in Sec. 19.722 of this chapter. The wine 
gallons of spirits thus determined for one case may then be multiplied 
by the number of cases containing spirits at the same proof when 
determining the quantity of spirits for more than one case. The proof 
gallons of spirits in cases shall be determined by multiplying the wine 
gallons by the proof (divided by 100).

                       Subpart E_Prescribed Tables

    Note. The tables referred to in this subpart appear in their 
entirety in the ``Gauging Manual Embracing Instructions and Tables for 
Determining Quantity of Distilled Spirits by Proof and Weight'' which is 
incorporated by reference in this part (see Sec. 30.1).

[[Page 845]]


<R05>
Sec. 30.61  Table 1, showing the true percent of proof spirit for any
indication of the hydrometer at temperatures between zero and

100 degrees Fahrenheit.

    This table shows the true percent of proof of distilled spirits for 
indications of the hydrometer likely to occur in practice at 
temperatures between zero and 100 degrees Fahrenheit and shall be used 
in determining the proof of spirits. The left-hand column contains the 
reading of the hydrometer and on the same horizontal line, in the body 
of the table, in the ``Temperature'' column corresponding to the reading 
of the thermometer is the corrected reading or ``true percent of 
proof.'' The table is computed for tenths of a percent.
    Example. 

Temperature, [deg]F............................................       75
Hydrometer reading.............................................      193
True percent of proof..........................................    189.5
 


Where fractional readings are ascertained, the proper interpolations 
will be made (see Sec. 30.23). If the distilled spirits contain 
dissolved solids, temperature-correction of the hydrometer reading by 
the use of this table would result in apparent proof rather than true 
proof.

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5204))


<R05>
Sec. 30.62  Table 2, showing wine gallons and proof gallons by weight.

    The wine and proof gallon content by weight and proof of packages of 
distilled spirits usually found in actual practice will be ascertained 
from this table. The left-hand column contains the weights. The true 
percent of proof is shown on the heading of each page in a range from 90 
degrees to 200 degrees. Under the true percent of proof and on the same 
horizontal line with the weight will be found the wine gallons (at 60 
degrees Fahrenheit) and the proof gallons respectively. Where either the 
weight or the proof of a quantity of spirits is beyond the limitations 
of this table, the number of proof gallons may be ascertained by 
reference to Table 3. This table may also be used to ascertain the wine 
gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) and proof gallons of spirituous 
liquor containing dissolved solids where the weight, apparent proof 
(hydrometer indication corrected to 60 degrees Fahrenheit), and 
obscuration factor have been determined.

    Example. 334 lbs. of distilled spirits.
Apparent proof--96.0[deg].
Obscuration--0.8[deg].
True Proof 96.0[deg]+0.8[deg]=96.8[deg].
334 lbs. at 96.0[deg] apparent proof=42.8 wine gallons.
42.8 wine gallonsx96.8[deg]=41.4 proof gallons.
    In addition this table may be used to obtain the wine gallons, at 
the prevailing temperature, of most liquids within the range of the 
table, from the weight of the liquid and the uncorrected reading of the 
hydrometer stem. An application of this would be in determining the 
capacity of a package.
    Example. It is desired to determine, or to check the rated capacity 
of a package having a net weight of 395 pounds when completely filled 
with spirits having an uncorrected hydrometer reading of 113.0[deg]. The 
full capacity of the package, 51.5 wine gallons, would be found by 
referring to the table at 395 pounds and 113[deg] proof (hydrometer 
reading).

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended, 1362, as amended 
(26 U.S.C. 5204, 5211))


<R05>
Sec. 30.63  Table 3, for determining the number of proof gallons from
the weight and proof of spirituous liquor.

    When the weight or proof of a quantity of distilled spirits is not 
found in Table 2, the proof gallons may be ascertained from Table 3. The 
wine gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) may be ascertained by dividing 
the proof gallons by the proof.

    Example. A tank car of spirits of 190 degrees of proof weighed 
60,378 pounds net. We find--

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 Proof
                                                                gallons
------------------------------------------------------------------------
60,000 pounds equal to.......................................   16,778.4
300 pounds equal to..........................................       83.9
70 pounds equal to...........................................       19.6
8 pounds equal to............................................        2.2
                                                              ----------
      Total..................................................   16,884.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------


That is, the total weight of 60,378 pounds of spirits at 190 proof is 
equal to 16,884.1 proof gallons. The equivalent gallonage for 70 pounds 
is found from the column 700 pounds by moving the decimal point one 
place to the left; that for 8 pounds from the column 800 pounds by 
moving the decimal point two places to the left.
    Example. A package of spirits at 86 proof weighed 321\1/2\ pounds 
net. We find--

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 Proof
                                                                gallons
------------------------------------------------------------------------
300 pounds equal to..........................................       32.7

[[Page 846]]

 
20 pounds equal to...........................................        2.2
1 pound equal to.............................................         .1
\1/2\ pound equal to.........................................         .1

      Total..................................................       35.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------


That is, 321\1/2\ pounds of spirits at 86 proof is equal to 35.1 proof 
gallons. The equivalent gallonage for 20 pounds is found from the column 
200 pounds by moving the decimal point one place to the left; that for 1 
pound from the column 100 pounds by moving the decimal point two places 
to the left; that for the \1/2\ pound from the column 500 pounds by 
moving the decimal point three places to the left.


Fractional gallons beyond the first decimal ascertained through use of 
this table will be dropped if less than 0.05 or will be added as 0.1 if 
0.05 or more. The wine gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) may be 
determined by dividing the proof gallons by the proof. For example: 35.1 
divided by 0.86 equals 40.8 wine gallons.

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended (26 U.S.C.5204))


<R05>
Sec. 30.64  Table 4, showing the fractional part of a gallon per pound
at each percent and each tenth percent of proof of spirituous liquor.

    This table provides a method for use in ascertaining the wine gallon 
(at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) and/or proof gallon contents of containers of 
spirits by multiplying the net weight of the spirits by the fractional 
part of a gallon per pound shown in the table for spirits of the same 
proof. Fractional gallons beyond the first decimal will be dropped if 
less than 0.05 or will be added as 0.1 if 0.05 or more.

    Example. It is desired to ascertain the wine gallons and proof 
gallons of a tank of 190 proof spirits weighing 81,000 pounds.

81,000x0.14718=11,921.58=11,921.6 wine gallons.
81,000x0.27964=22,650.84=22,650.8 proof gallons.


This table may also be used for ascertaining the quantity of water 
required to reduce to a given proof. To do this, divide the proof 
gallons of spirits to be reduced by the fractional part of a proof 
gallon per pound of spirits at the proof to which the spirits are to be 
reduced, and subtract from the quotient the net weight of the spirits 
before reduction. The remainder will be the pounds of water needed to 
reduce the spirits to the desired proof.

    Example. It is desired to ascertain the quantity of water needed to 
reduce 1,000 pounds of 200 proof spirits, 302.58 proof gallons, to 190 
proof:

302.58 divided by 0.27964 equals 1,082.03 pounds, weight of spirits 
after reduction.
1.082.03 minus 1,000 equals 82.03 pounds, weight of water required to 
reduce to desired proof.


The slight variation between this table and Tables 2, 3, and 5 on some 
calculations is due to the dropping or adding of fractions beyond the 
first decimal in those tables. This table may also be used to determine 
the wine gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) of distilled spirits 
containing dissolved solids from the total weight of the liquid and its 
apparent proof (hydrometer indication, corrected to 60 degrees 
Fahrenheit). The proof gallons may then be found by multiplying the wine 
gallons by the true proof.

    Example. 5,350 pounds of blended whisky containing added solids

Temperature [deg]F.............................................75.0[deg]
Hydrometer reading.............................................92.0[deg]
Apparent proof.................................................85.5[deg]
Obscuration.....................................................0.5[deg]
True proof.....................................................86.0[deg]

5,350.0 lbs.x0.12676 (W.G. per pound factor for apparent proof of 
85.5[deg])=678.2 wine gallons
678.2 W.G.x0.86=583.3 proof gallons

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended 1362, as amended 
(26 U.S.C. 5204, 5211))


<R05>
Sec. 30.65  Table 5, showing the weight per wine gallon (at 60 degrees 
Fahrenheit) and proof gallon at each percent of proof of spirituous liquor.

    This table may be used to ascertain the weight of any given number 
of wine gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) or proof gallons of spirits 
by multiplying the pounds per gallon by the given number of gallons of 
the spirits. The table should be especially useful where it is desired 
to weigh a precise quantity of spirits.

    Example. It is desired to ascertain the weight of 100 wine gallons 
of 190 proof spirits:

6.79434x100 equals 679.43 pounds, net weight of 100 wine gallons of 190 
proofs spirits.

[[Page 847]]

    Example. It is desired to ascertain the weight of 100 proof gallons 
of 190 proof spirits.

3.57597x100 equals 357.60 pounds, net weight of 100 proof gallons of 190 
proof spirits.


The slight variation between this table and Tables 2 and 3 on some 
calculations is due to dropping or adding of fractions beyond the first 
decimal on those tables. This table also shows the weight per wine 
gallon (at the prevailing temperature) corresponding to each uncorrected 
reading of a proof hydrometer.

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5204))


<R05>
Sec. 30.66  Table 6, showing respective volumes of alcohol and water
and the specific gravity in both air and vacuum of spirituous liquor.

    This table provides an alternate method for use in ascertaining the 
quantity of water needed to reduce the strength of distilled spirits by 
a definite amount. To do this, divide the alcohol in the given strength 
by the alcohol in the required strength, multiply the quotient by the 
water in the required strength, and subtract the water in the given 
strength from the product. The remainder is the number of gallons of 
water to be added to 100 gallons of spirits of the given strength to 
produce a spirit of a required strength.

    Example. It is desired to reduce spirits of 191 proof to 188 proof. 
We find that 191 proof spirits contains 95.5 parts alcohol and 5.59 
parts water, and 188 proof spirits contains 94.0 parts alcohol and 7.36 
parts water.

95.5 (the strength of 100 wine gallons of spirits at 191 proof) divided 
by 94.0 (the strength of 100 wine gallons of spirits at 188 proof) 
equals 1.01.
7.36 (the water in 188 proof) multiplied by 1.01 equals 7.43.
7.43 less 5.59 (the water in 191 proof spirits) equal 1.84 gallons of 
water to be added to each 100 wine gallons of 191 proof spirits to be 
reduced.


This rule is applicable for reducing to any proof; but when it is 
desired to reduce to 100 proof, it is sufficient to point off two 
decimals in the given proof, multiply by 53.73, and deduct the water in 
the given strength. Thus, to reduce 112 proof spirits to 100 proof:

1.12x53.73-47.75 equals 12.42 gallons of water to be added to each 100 
wine gallons of spirits to be reduced.


This table may also be used to obtain the proof gallonage of spirituous 
liquor according to weight and percent of proof.

    Example. It is desired to determine the number of gallons in 400 
pounds of spirits of 141 percent of proof. Multiply the weight of one 
gallon of water in air by the specific gravity in air of the spirits--
8.32823 by 0.88862--the product (7.40063) divided into 400 gives 54.049 
wine gallons, which rounded to the nearest hundredth is 54.05 and 
multiplied by 1.41 gives 76.2 proof gallons. In rounding off where the 
decimal is less than five, it will be dropped; if it is five or over a 
unit will be added.

(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5204))


<R05>
Sec. 30.67  Table 7, for correction of volume of spirituous liquors to
60 degrees Fahrenheit.

    This table is prescribed for use in correcting spirits to volume at 
60 degrees Fahrenheit. To do this, multiply the wine gallons of spirits 
which it is desired to correct to volume at 60 degrees Fahrenheit by the 
factor shown in the table at the percent of proof and temperature of the 
spirits. The product will be the corrected gallonage at 60 degrees 
Fahrenheit. This table is also prescribed for use in ascertaining the 
true capacity of containers where the wine gallon contents at 60 degrees 
Fahrenheit have been determined by weight in accordance with Tables 2, 
3, 4, or 5. This is accomplished by dividing the wine gallons at 60 
degrees Fahrenheit by the factor shown in the table at the percent of 
proof and temperature of the spirits. The quotient will be the true 
capacity of the container.

    Example. It is desired to ascertain the volume at 60 degrees 
Fahrenheit of 1,000 wine gallons of 190 proof spirits at 76 degrees 
Fahrenheit:

1,000x0.991 equals 991 wine gallons, the corrected gallonage at 60 
degrees Fahrenheit.
    Example. It is desired to ascertain the capacity of a container of 
190 proof spirits at 76 degrees Fahrenheit, shown by Table 2 to contain 
55.1 wine gallons at 60 degrees Fahrenheit:

55.1 divided by 0.991 equals 55.6 wine gallons, the true capacity of the 
container when

[[Page 848]]

filled with spirits of 60 degrees temperature.


It will be noted the table is prepared in multiples of 5 percent of 
proof and 2 degrees temperature. Where the spirits to be corrected are 
of an odd temperature, one-half of the difference, if any, between the 
factors for the next higher and lower temperature, should be added to 
the factor for the next higher temperature.

    Example. It is desired to correct spirits of 180 proof at 51 degrees 
temperature:

1.006 (50[deg])-1.005 (52[deg])=0.001 divided by 2=0.0005
0.0005+1.005=1.0055 correction factor at 51 [deg]F.
    Example. It is desired to correct spirits of 180 proof at 53 degrees 
temperature:

1.005 (52[deg])-1.003 (54[deg])=0.002 divided by 2=0.001
0.001+1.003=1.004 correction factor at 53 [deg]F.


Where the percent of proof is other than a multiple of five, the 
difference, if any, between the factors for the next higher and lower 
proofs should be divided by five and multiplied by the degrees of proof 
beyond the next lower proof, and the fractional product so obtained 
should be added to the factor for the next lower proof (if the 
temperature is above 60 degrees Fahrenheit, the fractional product so 
obtained must be subtracted from the factor for next lower proof), or if 
it is also necessary to correct the factor because of odd temperature, 
to the temperature corrected factor for the next lower proof.

    Example. It is desired to ascertain the correction factor for 
spirits of 112 proof at 47 degrees temperature:

1.006 (46[deg])-1.005 (48[deg])=0.001 divided by 2=0.0005
0.0005+1.005=1.0055 corrected factor at 47 [deg]F.
1.007 (115 proof)-1.006 (110 proof)=0.001
0.001 divided by 5=0.0002 (for each percent of proof)x2 (for 112 
proof)=0.0001
0.0004=1.0055 (corrected factor at 47 [deg]F.)=1.0059 correction factor 
to be used for 112 proof at 47 [deg]F
    Example. It is desired to ascertain the correction factor for 
spirits of 97 proof at 93 degrees temperature:

0.986 (92[deg])-0.985 (94[deg])=0.001 divided by 2=0.0005
0.0005+0.985=0.9855 corrected factor at 93 [deg]F.
0.986 (95 proof)-0.985 (100 proof)=0.001
0.001 divided by 5=0.0002 (for each percent of proof)x2 (for 97 
proof)=0.0004
0.9855 (corrected factor at 93 [deg]F.)=0.0005=0.9851 correction factor 
to be used for 97 proof at 93 [deg]F.

failures during a calendar year. A failure to submit a registration 
includes a failure to include the identifying number on the

    (c) Reasonable cause. The administrative penalty described in

all of the circumstances alleged as reasonable causes for the failure. 
If the appropriate TTB officer determines that the failure was due to a 
reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, the penalty will not be 
assessed. If the dealer exercised ordinary business care and prudence 
but was nevertheless unable to comply with the requirement, then the 
failure was due to reasonable cause. Mere ignorance of the law will not 
be considered a reasonable cause.

    (1) Furnishes liquors to members under conditions constituting a 
sale (including the acceptance of orders therefor, furnishing the 
liquors ordered and collecting the price thereof); or
    (2) Conducts a bar for the sale of liquors on the occasion of an 
outing, picnic, or other entertainment, unless the club is a ``limited 
retail dealer'' described in Sec. 31.35. The registration of the 
proprietor of the premises where the bar is located will not relieve the 
club or organization from its own obligation to register; or
    (3) Purchases liquors for members without prior agreement concerning 
payment therefor and such organization subsequently recoups those costs.
    (b) Compliance with the registration and other requirements of this 
part is not required if money is collected in advance from members for 
the purchase of liquors, or if money is advanced for the purchase of 
liquors pursuant to an agreement with the members for reimbursement.

this part. However, no such governmental entity shall be required to 
register more than once as a retail dealer in liquors regardless of the 
number of locations at which the entity carries on business as a retail 
dealer in liquors. Any such governmental entity that has properly 
registered as a wholesale dealer at its principal office, and that has 
properly registered once as a retail dealer in liquors or beer, is not

denatured spirits, for beverage purposes. Any person who sells denatured 
spirits, or any substance or preparation made with or containing 
denatured spirits, for use, or for sale for use, for beverage purposes,

reasonably appear that it is the intention of the purchaser to procure

    Unless specifically exempt by statute, any agency or instrumentality 
of the United States, including post exchanges, ship's stores, ship's 
service stores, and commissaries, or any canteen, club, mess, or similar 
organization operated under regulations of any such agency or 
instrumentality, that sells, or offers for sale, distilled spirits, 
wines, or beer must comply with the registration and other requirements 
of this part as a dealer in liquors or a dealer in beer, as the case may 
be.

    Brewers and proprietors of distilled spirits plants, bonded wine

    A single sale of distilled spirits, wines, or beer, or a single sale

and other requirements of this part.

(26 U.S.C. 5121, 5122)


<R05>
Sec. 31.62  Persons making casual sales.

    Certain persons making casual sales of liquors are not dealers for

persons, who have no property rights in the liquors

[[Page 857]]

sold, may make collections for their principals and receive commissions 
for their services, or may guarantee the payment of accounts, without 
being required to register or keep records under this part. In all such

    (b) Restrictions. Any person who sells or offers for sale any 
nonbeverage products for use, or for sale for use, for beverage 
purposes, or who sells any of such products under circumstances in which

dealer in beer, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 31.66  Retail dealer selling entire stock in liquidation.

    No retail dealer in liquors or retail dealer in beer shall be deemed

spirits, wines, or beer to the dealer from whom the distilled spirits, 
wines, or beer were purchased (or to the successor of such vendor's 
business or line of merchandise) for credit, refund, or exchange; and 
the giving of such credit, refund or exchange shall not be deemed to be 
a purchase within the meaning of Sec. 31.141 of this part. Except in 
the case of wholesale dealers in liquors required to keep records of 
their transactions under Sec. Sec. 31.155 and 31.156, or retail dealers

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 31.43 and in subpart D of this 
part, registration is required under this part for each and every place 
where distilled

[[Page 858]]

spirits, wines, or beer are sold or offered for sale. No person may 
engage in any business for which registration is required until the 
place of business has been registered in accordance with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 31.72  Place of sale.

    For purposes of this part, the place at which ownership of liquors 
is transferred, actually or constructively, is the place of sale.


<R05>
Sec. 31.73  Place of offering for sale.

    Liquors are considered to be offered for sale at the place where 
they are kept for sale and where a sale could take place, and at any 
place where sales are in fact consummated. Liquors are not considered to 
be offered for sale by sending an agent out to take orders, or by 
establishing an office for the mere purpose of taking orders, so long as 
in each case the orders received are transmitted to the principal for 
acceptance at the place where that principal has registered under this 
part or where the principal is exempt from registration as provided in 
subpart D of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 31.74  Places of storage; deliveries therefrom.

    Registration is not required under this part for warehouses and 
similar places that are used by dealers merely for the storage of 
liquors and that are not places where orders for liquors are accepted. 
When orders for liquors are received and duly accepted at a place that 
the dealer has registered under this part, the subsequent actual 
delivery of the liquors from a place of storage does not require 
registration at that place of storage. Except as otherwise provided in 
Sec. Sec. 31.52 and 31.53, a dealer who registered a given place, and 
who makes actual delivery of liquors from a warehouse at another place, 
must register for the place where ownership of the liquors is 
transferred if there was no prior constructive delivery by the 
acceptance of an order for the liquors at the place covered by the 
existing registration.


<R05>
Sec. 31.75  Dealer in beer and dealer in liquors at the same location.

    Any person who registers as a wholesale dealer in beer or retail 
dealer in beer and who thereafter begins to sell distilled spirits or 
wine must also register as a wholesale dealer in liquors or retail 
dealer in liquors before commencing the sale, or offering for sale, of 
distilled spirits or wine.

proprietor's place of business, whether the privilege is exercised 
separately or simultaneously with the proprietor or another 
concessionaire, each lessee is required to register only once.


<R05>
Sec. 31.82  Hotels.

    The proprietor of a hotel who conducts the sale of liquors 
throughout the hotel premises is only required to register under this 
part for one place. For example, different areas operated by the 
proprietor in the hotel, such as banquet rooms, meeting rooms, and guest 
rooms, collectively constitute a single place of business. When a 
concessionaire conducts the sale of liquors at two or more areas in a 
hotel, those areas are regarded as a single place of business, and the 
concessionaire is required to register only once.


<R05>
Sec. 31.83  Ball park, race track, etc.; sales throughout the premises.

    The proprietor of a ball park, race track, stadium, pavilion, or 
other similar enclosure constituting one premises, who engages in the

required to register only once for the entire enclosure. Each 
concessionaire having the same privilege throughout the enclosure,

[[Page 859]]

whether the privilege is exercised separately or simultaneously with the 
proprietor or another concessionaire, is required to register only once 
for the entire enclosure.

port or harbor. Such persons must specify, on an attachment to the 
registration form, the following: that the business will consist of 
supplying exclusively boats, vessels, or persons thereon; the name of 
the port or harbor at which the business is to be carried on; and the 
fixed address from which operations are to be conducted. When such sales 
are to be made from two or more supply boats or vessels, the dealer must 
also specify on the attachment the number of supply boats or vessels for 
which registration is being made. If the dealer operates from two or 
more fixed addresses, the dealer must prepare one registration form 
covering all of those addresses and must include on the attachment to 
the registration form the number of supply boats or vessels operating 
from each address.


<R05>
Sec. 31.94  Retail dealers ``At Large.''

    A retail dealer in liquors or a retail dealer in beer whose business 
requires the dealer to travel from place to place, such as a dealer who 
sells at carnivals or circuses, must register ``At Large'' covering the 
dealer's activities throughout the United States by filing only one 
registration. A dealer submitting such a registration must state on the 
registration form, or on an attachment thereto, the nature of the 
dealer's business and the reason the dealer requires registration ``At 
Large.''


<R05>
Sec. 31.95  Caterers.

    (a) General. When a contract to furnish liquors is made by a caterer 
at a place of business for which the caterer has registered under this 
part, no additional registration is required by virtue of the serving of 
the liquors at a different location.
    (b) Additional registration. When the contract of a caterer provides 
for the sale of liquors by the drink at a place, or simultaneously at 
different places, other than the place of business for which the caterer 
has registered under this part, a separate registration is required for 
each such place if the caterer does not keep the records specified in

    (c) Records. Caterers must maintain sufficient commercial records to 
identify all locations where activities subject to registration occur.

form is received in the mail and the U.S. postmark on the cover shows 
that it was deposited in the mail in the United States within the time 
prescribed for filing in an envelope or other appropriate wrapper that 
was properly addressed with postage prepaid, the form will be considered 
as timely filed. If the postmark is not legible, the sender has the 
burden of proving the date when the postmark was made. When registered 
mail is used, the date of postal registration will be accepted as the 
postmark date.
    (b) Transition rule. Dealers already engaged in business prior to 
July 1, 2008, must register as an ``existing business'' unless they had

    (a) Requirement. The employer identification number (as defined in

    (b) Application for employer identification number. Each dealer who 
files a registration form and who has not already been assigned an 
employer identification number must file Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
Form SS-4 to apply for one. The dealer shall apply for and be assigned 
only one employer identification number, regardless of the number of 
places of business for which the dealer is required to file a 
registration form under this part. The employer identification number 
shall be applied for no later than 7 days after the filing of the

member of the firm, and the registration of a corporation shall be 
signed by a duly authorized officer thereof; however, any individual,

fiduciary capacity in which he or she acts. Registration forms signed by 
persons as agents or attorneys-in-fact will not be accepted unless, in 
each instance, the principal named on the form has executed a power of 
attorney authorizing that person to sign and that power of attorney is 
filed with the TTB officer with whom the TTB Form 5630.5d is required to

liquors maintains a separate department on the premises for the 
retailing of distilled spirits, and the retail sales of distilled 
spirits normally represent 90 percent or more of the volume of distilled 
spirits sold, the dealer may ``constructively'' receive all distilled 
spirits in the retail department. Sales involving a wholesale 
transaction may be ``constructively'' sold through the wholesale 
department.
    (1) Receipts. In lieu of maintaining and preparing the records 
required by Sec. 31.155, a wholesale dealer may constructively receive 
all distilled spirits in its retail department. In this case, the 
receiving document will serve as a receipt for (through) the wholesale 
department and a disposition (transfer) to the retail department. The 
receiving document must be maintained by the retail department in 
accordance with Sec. 31.171.
    (2) Dispositions. In lieu of maintaining and preparing the records 
required by Sec. 31.156, a wholesale dealer may constructively sell 
distilled spirits from its retail department to other dealers. The sales 
invoice or bill must be filed in the wholesaler's disposition records 
and will serve as a record of receipt from the retail department and a 
record of disposition to another dealer.
    (b) Receipt and disposition records. Except as provided in paragraph 
(a) of this section, a wholesale dealer must prepare and maintain the 
required records of receipt and disposition as prescribed in Sec. Sec. 
31.155 and 31.156. Transfers between the wholesale and retail 
departments will be treated in the same manner as any other transaction 
involving the wholesale department.
    (c) Monthly summary report. When required by Sec. 31.160, a 
wholesale dealer must prepare and file the monthly summary report of 
actual or constructive receipts and dispositions of all distilled 
spirits.
    (d) Physical separation. Wholesale and retail departments need not 
be physically separated.

required by Sec. Sec. 31.155 and 31.156 in accordance with the 
wholesaler's regular accounting and recordkeeping systems. The required 
records must include the dealer's own file copies of the receiving or 
shipping invoices and must be filed according to the following rules:
    (a) Wholesale dealers may file records of receipt and disposition in 
accordance with their own filing system as long as the records are filed 
by transaction or reporting date and the filing system systematically 
and accurately accounts for all receipts and dispositions of distilled 
spirits.
    (b) The required records of receipt and disposition must be filed 
not later than one business day following the date the transaction 
occurred.
    (c) Supporting documents for receipts and dispositions, such as

    Records of receipt and disposition and monthly summary reports 
required by Sec. Sec. 31.155, 31.156, and 31.160 must be maintained at 
the dealer's place of business. The appropriate TTB officer may, upon 
request, authorize maintenance of files, or an individual file, at 
another business location under the control of the same wholesale 
dealer, when it is determined that such maintenance will not cause undue 
inconvenience to TTB officers desiring to examine those files.

of business complete records showing the quantities of all distilled 
spirits, wines, and beer received, from whom the distilled

[[Page 868]]

spirits, wines, and beer were received, and the dates of receipt. 
However, the appropriate TTB officer may, upon request, authorize the 
maintenance of records at another business premises also under the 
control of the same retail dealer when it is determined that such 
maintenance will not cause undue inconvenience to TTB officers desiring 
to examine those records. Records of receipts shall consist of all 
purchase invoices or bills covering distilled spirits, wines, and beer 
received, or, at the option of the retail dealer, a book record 
containing all of the required information.
    (b) Records of sales of 20 wine gallons (75.7 liters) or more. Every 
retail dealer who makes sales of distilled spirits, of wines, or of beer 
in quantities of 20 wine gallons (75.7 liters) or more to the same 
person at the same time must prepare and keep a record of each sale. The 
record must show the date of sale, the name and address of the 
purchaser, the kind and quantity of each kind of liquors sold, and the 
serial numbers of all full cases of distilled spirits included in the 
sale. Each entry on that record must be supported by a corresponding 
delivery receipt (which may be executed on a copy of the sales slip) 
signed by the purchaser or the purchaser's agent.

are reproduced under this section, the reproduced records must be 
preserved in conveniently accessible files, and provision must be made 
for examining, viewing, and using the reproduced record in the same 
manner as if it were the original record. A reproduced record will be
