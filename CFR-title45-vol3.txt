                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    (a) No member, officer or employee of the Commission, including a 
special Government employee shall, after employment has ceased,

involved significant decision making or supervisory responsibility as 
designated by the Director of the Office of Government Ethics under 18 
U.S.C. 207(d)(1)(C), shall, within two years after employment has

connection with any matter enumerated and described in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section in which such Government employee is participating or 
has participated personally and substantially as a Government employee 
through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering 
of advice, investigation or otherwise, or which is the subject of his or 
her official responsibility.


<R05>
Sec. 500.6  Disciplinary proceedings against former employees.

    (a) Upon a determination by the Commission's Designated Ethics 
Officer, after investigation, that there is reasonable cause to believe 
that a former officer or employee, including a former special Government 
employee, has violated 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b) or (c), the Designated 
Ethics Officer shall cause a copy of written charges of the violation(s) 
to be served upon such individual, either personally or by registered 
mail. The charges shall be accompanied by a notice to the former 
employee to show cause within a specified time of not less than 30 days 
after receipt of the notice why he or she should not be prohibited from 
engaging in representational activities in relation to matters pending 
before the Commission, as authorized by 18 U.S.C. 207(j), or subjected 
to other appropriate disciplinary action under that statute. The notice 
to show cause shall include:
    (1) A statement of allegations, and their basis, sufficiently 
detailed to enable the former employee to prepare an adequate defense;
    (2) Notification of the right to a hearing; and
    (3) An explanation of the method by which a hearing may be 
requested.
    (b) If a former employee who submits an answer to the notice to show 
cause does not request a hearing or if the Designated Ethics Officer 
does not receive an answer within five days after the expiration of the 
time prescribed by the notice, the Designated Ethics Officer shall 
forward the record, including the report(s) of investigation, to the 
Chairman. In the case of a failure to answer, such failure shall 
constitute a waiver of defense.
    (c) Upon receipt of a former employee's request for a hearing, the

Commission at least 15 days prior to the proposed date of such hearing 
or examination.
    (2) Application to take a deposition may be made during a hearing or 
examination, or subsequent to a hearing or examination, only where it is 
shown for good cause that the facts as set forth in the application to 
take the deposition were not within the knowledge of the person signing 
the application prior to the time of the hearing or examination.
    (3) The Commission or its representative shall, upon receipt of the 
application and a showing of good cause, make and cause to be served 
upon the parties an order which will specify the name of the witness 
whose deposition is to be taken, the time, the place, and where 
practicable the designation of the officer before whom the witness is to 
testify. Such officer may or may not be the one specified in the 
application. The order shall be served upon all parties at least 10 days 
prior to the date of the taking of the deposition.
    (b) Who may take. Such deposition may be taken before the designated 
officer or, if none is designated, before any officer authorized to 
administer oaths by the laws of the United States. If the examination is 
held in a foreign country, it may be taken before a secretary of an 
embassy or legation, consul-general, consul, vice consul, or consular 
agent of the United States.
    (c) Examination and certification of testimony. At the time and 
place specified in said order the officer taking such deposition shall 
permit the witness to be examined and cross-examined under oath by all 
parties appearing, and the testimony shall be reduced to writing by, or

questions or evidence shall be deemed waived unless made in accordance 
with paragraph (d) of this section. The officer shall not have power to 
rule upon any objections but shall note them upon the deposition. The 
testimony shall be subscribed by the witness in the presence of the 
officer who shall attach a certificate stating that the witness was duly 
sworn, that the deposition is a true record of the testimony and 
exhibits given by the witness and that said officer is not counsel or 
attorney to any of the interested parties. The officer shall immediately 
seal and deliver an original and two copies of said transcript, together 
with the officer's certificate, by registered mail to the Foreign Claims 
Settlement Commission, Washington, DC 20579 or to the field office 
designated.
    (d) Admissibility in evidence. The deposition shall be admissible in 
evidence, subject to such objections to the questions and answers as 
were noted at the

[[Page 13]]

time of taking the deposition, or within ten (10) days after the return 
thereof, and would be valid were the witness personally present at the 
hearing.
    (e) Errors and irregularities. All errors or irregularities 
occurring shall be deemed waived unless a motion to suppress the 
deposition or some part thereof is made with reasonable promptness after 
such defect is, or with due diligence might have been, ascertained.
    (f) Scope of use. The deposition of a witness, if relevant, may be 
used if the Commission finds:
    (1) That the witness has died since the deposition was taken; or
    (2) that the witness is at a distance greater than 100 miles radius 
of Washington, DC, the designated field office or the designated place 
of the hearing; or
    (3) that the witness is unable to attend because of other good cause 
shown.
    (g) Interrogatories and cross-interrogatories. Depositions may also 
be taken and submitted on written interrogatories in substantially the 
same manner as depositions taken by oral examinations. When a deposition 
is taken upon interrogatories and cross-interrogatories, none of the 
parties shall be present or represented, and no person, other than the 
witness, such person's representative or attorney, a stenographic 
reporter and the presiding officer, shall be present at the examination 
of the witness, which fact shall be certified by such officer, who shall 
propound the interrogatories and cross-interrogatories to the witness in 
their order and reduce the testimony to writing in the witness' own 
words.
    (h) Fees. A witness whose deposition is taken pursuant to the 
regulations in this part, and the officer taking the deposition, shall 
be entitled to the same fees and mileage allowed and paid for like 
service in the United States District Court for the district in which 
the deposition is taken. Such fees shall be paid by the Commission or by 
the party at whose request the deposition is being taken.

Sec. 503.8  Effect of noncompliance.

    No decision, statement of policy, interpretation, or staff manual or 
instruction that affects any member of the public will be relied upon, 
used, or cited as precedent by the Commission against any private party 
unless it has been indexed and either made available or published as 
provided by this part, or unless that private party shall have actual 
and timely notice of the terms thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 503.9  Availability of records.

    (a) Each person desiring access to a record covered by this part 
must comply with the following provisions:
    (1) A written request must be made for the record.
    (2) Such request must indicate that it is being made under the 
Freedom of Information Act.
    (3) The envelope in which the request is sent must be prominently 
marked with the letters ``FOIA''.
    (4) The request must be addressed to the appropriate official or 
employee of the Commission as set forth in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (5) The foregoing requirements must be complied with whether the 
request is mailed or hand-delivered to the Commission.
    (b) If the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are not 
met, the ten day time limit described in Sec. 503.10(a) will not begin 
to run until the request has been identified by an official or employee 
of the Commission as a request under the Freedom of Information Act and 
has been received by the appropriate official or employee of the 
Commission.
    (c) Each person desiring access to a record covered in this part 
that is located in the Commission, or to obtain a copy of such a record, 
must make a written request to the Administrative Officer, Foreign 
Claims Settlement Commission, 1111 20th Street NW., Washington, DC 
20579.
    (d) Each request should reasonably describe the particular record 
requested. The request should specify the subject matter, the date when 
it was made and the person or office that made it. If the description is 
insufficient, the official or employee handling the request may notify 
the person making the request and, to the extent possible, indicate the 
additional data required.
    (e) Each record made available under this section is available for 
inspection and copying during regular working hours. Original documents 
may be copied but may not be released from custody.
    (f) Authority to administer this part in connection with Commission 
records is delegated to the Administrative Officer or the Commission 
employee acting in that official's capacity.


<R05>
Sec. 503.10  Actions on requests.

    (a) The Administrative Officer or any employee acting in that 
official's capacity shall determine within ten days (excepting 
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of any 
such request whether to comply with such request. Upon receipt of a 
request for a Commission record which is available, thu Administrative 
Officer or other employee shall notify the requester as to the time the 
record is available, and shall promptly make the record available after 
advising such requester of the applicable fees under Sec. 503.13. The 
person making such request shall be notified immediately after any 
adverse determination, the reasons for making such adverse determination 
and the right of such person to appeal.
    (b) Any denial of a request for a record shall be written and signed 
by the Administrative Officer or other employee, including a statement 
of the reason for denial. Such statement shall contain, as applicable:
    (1) A reference to the specific exemption under the Freedom of 
Information Act authorizing the withholding of a record, and to the 
extent consistent with the purpose of the exemption, an explanation of 
how the exemption applies to the record withheld.
    (2) If a record requested does not exist or has been legally 
disposed of, the requester shall be so notified.
    (c) In unusual circumstances, the time limit prescribed in paragraph 
(a) may be extended by written notice to the person making such request 
setting forth the reasons for such extension and the date on which a 
determination is expected to be dispatched. No such

[[Page 18]]

notice shall specify a date that would result in an extension for more 
than ten working days. As used in this paragraph, ``unusual 
circumstances'' means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to 
the proper processing of the particular request--
    (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
other establishments that are separate from the office processing the 
request;
    (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in 
a single request; or
    (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in 
the determination of the request or among two or more components of the 
agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.
    (d) With respect to determinations on appeals, such determinations 
shall be made within twenty days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and 
legal holidays) after the receipt of such appeal. If, on appeal, the 
denial of the request for records is in whole or in part upheld, the 
person making such request shall be notified of the provisions for 
judicial review of that determination under section 552(a)(4) of title 
5, United States Code.


<R05>
Sec. 503.11  Appeals.

    (a) Any person to whom a record has not been made available within 
the time limits established by paragraph (d) of Sec. 503.10, and any 
person who has been given an adverse determination pursuant to paragraph 
(b) of Sec. 503.10, that a requested record will not be disclosed, may 
apply to the Chairman of the Commission, or in the Chairman's absence an 
officer or employee designated by the Chairman, for reconsideration of 
the request. A determination that a record will not be disclosed is not 
administratively final for the purpose of judicial review unless it was 
made by the Chairman or Chairman's designee, unless the applicable time 
limit has passed without a determination of the appeal having been made.
    (b) Each application for reconsideration must be made in writing 
within thirty days from the date of receipt of the original denial and 
must include all information and arguments relied upon by the person 
making the request. Such application must indicate that it is an appeal 
from a denial of a request made under the Freedom of Information Act. 
The envelope in which the application is sent must be prominently marked 
with the letters ``FOIA''. If these requirements are not met, the twenty 
day limit described in Sec. 503.10 will not begin to run until the 
application has been identified as an application under the Freedom of 
Information Act and has been received by the appropriate office.
    (c) Whenever it is to be determined necessary, the person making the 
request may be required to furnish additional information, or proof of 
factual allegations and other proceedings appropriate in the 
circumstances may be ordered. The decision of the Chairman or Chairman's 
designee as to the availability of the record is administratively final.
    (d) The decision not to disclose a record under this part is 
considered to be a withholding for the purposes of section 552(a)(3) of 
title 5, United States Code.


<R05>
Sec. 503.12  Exemptions.

    In the event any document or record requested hereunder shall 
contain material which is exempt from disclosure under this section, any 
reasonably segregable portion of such record shall, notwithstanding such 
fact, and to the extent feasible, be provided to any person requesting 
same, after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this 
section. Documents or records determined to be exempt from disclosure 
hereunder may nonetheless be provided upon request in the event it is 
determined that the provision of such document would not violate the 
public interest or the right of any person to whom such information may 
pertain, and the disclosure is not prohibited by law or Executive Order. 
The following categories of records are exempt from disclosure under the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b):
    (a) Records which are specifically required by Executive Order to be 
kept

[[Page 19]]

secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and are in 
fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order. This 
exception may apply to records in the custody of the Commission which 
have been transmitted to the Commission by another agency which has 
designated the record as nonpublic under Executive Order.
    (b) Records related solely to the internal personnel rules and 
practices of the Commission.
    (c) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute.
    (d) Information given in confidence. This includes information 
obtained by or given to the Commission which constitutes confidential 
commercial or financial information, privileged information, or other 
information which was given to the Commission in confidence or would not 
customarily be released by the person from whom it was obtained.
    (e) Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would 
not be available by law to a private party in litigation with the 
Commission. Such communications include inter-agency memoranda, drafts, 
staff memoranda transmitted to the Commission, written communications 
between the Commission and its staff regarding the preparation of 
Commission decisions, other documents received or generated in the 
process of issuing a decision or regulation, and reports and other work 
papers of staff attorneys, accountants, and investigators.
    (f) Personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of 
which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy.
    (g) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, 
but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement 
records or information:
    (1) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement 
proceedings;
    (2) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an 
impartial adjudication;
    (3) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy;
    (4) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a 
confidential source, including a state, local or foreign agency or 
authority or any private institution which furnished information on a 
confidential basis and, in the case of a record or information compiled 
by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal 
investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful security intelligence 
investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;
    (5) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement 
investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be 
expected to risk circumvention of the law; or
    (6) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical 
safety of any individual.


<R05>
Sec. 503.13  Fees for services.

    The following provisions shall apply in the assessment and 
collection of fees for services rendered in processing requests for 
disclosure of Commission records under this part.
    (a) Fee for duplication of records. $0.15 per page.
    (b) Search and review fees. (1) Searches for records by clerical 
personnel--$2.00 per quarter hour, including time spent searching for 
and copying any record.
    (2) Search for and review of records by professional and supervisory 
personnel--$5.50 per quarter hour spent searching for any record or 
reviewing a record to determine whether it may be disclosed, including 
time spent in copying any record.
    (c) Certification and validation fee. $1.00 for each certification, 
validation or authentication of a copy of any record.
    (d) Imposition of fees. (1) Commercial use requests--Where a request 
appears to seek disclosure of records for a commercial use, the 
requester shall be charged for the time spent by Commission personnel in 
searching for the requested record and in reviewing the record to 
determine whether it should be disclosed, and for the cost of each page 
of duplication. ``Commercial use'' is defined as a use or purpose that 
furthers the commercial, trade or profit interests of the requester or 
the person on whose behalf the request is made. The request also must 
reasonably identify the records sought.

[[Page 20]]

    (2) Requests from representatives of news media--Where a request 
seeks disclosure of records to a representative of the news media, the 
requester shall be charged only for the actual duplication cost of the 
records and only to the extent that the number of duplications exceeds 
100 pages; provided, however, that the request must reasonably describe 
the records sought, and it must appear that the records are for use by 
the requester in such person's capacity as a news media representative. 
``Representative of the news media'' refers to any person actively 
gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish 
or broadcast news to the public. The term ``news'' means information 
that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the 
public. A ``freelance'' journalist not actually employed by a news 
organization shall be eligible for inclusion under this category if such 
person can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication by a news 
organization.
    (3) Requests from educational and non-commercial scientific 
institutions--Where a request seeks disclosure of records to an 
educational or non-commercial scientific institution, the requester 
shall be charged only for the actual duplication cost of the records and 
only to the extent that the number of duplications exceeds 100 pages; 
provided, however, that the request must reasonably describe the records 
sought and it must appear that the records are to be used by the 
requester in furtherance of its educational or non-commercial scientific 
research programs. ``Educational institution'' refers to a preschool, a 
public or private elementary or secondary school, or an institution of 
undergraduate, graduate, professional or vocational education, which 
operates a program or programs of scholarly research. ``Non-commercial 
scientific institution'' refers to an institution that is not operated 
on a ``commercial'' basis, within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting 
scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote 
any particular product or industry.
    (4) All other requests--Where a request seeks disclosure of records 
to a person or entity other than one coming within paragraphs (d) (1), 
(2) and (3) of this section, the requester shall be charged the full 
cost of search and duplication. However, the first two hours of search 
time and the first 100 pages of duplication shall be furnished without 
charge.
    (e) Aggregating of requests. If there exists a solid basis for 
concluding that a requester or group of requesters has submitted a 
series of partial requests for disclosure of records in an attempt to 
evade assessment of fees, the requests may be aggregated so as to 
constitute a single request, with fees charged accordingly.
    (f) Unsuccessful searches. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of 
this section, the cost of searching for a requested record shall be 
charged even if the search fails to locate such record or it is 
determined that the record is exempt from disclosure.
    (g) Interest. In the event a requester fails to remit payment of 
fees charged for processing a request under this part within 30 days 
from the date such fees were billed, interest on such fees may be 
assessed beginning on the 31st day after the billing date, to be 
calculated at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31, United 
States Code.
    (h) Advance payments. (1) If, but only if, it is estimated or 
determined that processing of a request for disclosure of records will 
result in a charge of fees of more than $250.00, the requester may be 
required to pay the fees in advance in order to obtain completion of 
such processing.
    (2) If a requester has previously failed to make timely payment 
(i.e., within 30 days of billing date) of fees charged under this part, 
the requester may be required to pay such fees and interest accrued 
thereon, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of estimated 
fees chargeable in connection with any pending or new request, in order 
to obtain processing of such pending or new request.
    (3) With regard to any request coming within paragraphs (h) (1) and 
(2) of this section, the administrative time limits set forth in 
Secs. 503.10 and 503.11 of this part will begin to run only after the 
requisite fee payments have been received.

[[Page 21]]

    (i) Non-payment. In the event of non-payment of billed charges for 
disclosure of records, the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 
(Pub. L. 97-365), including disclosure to consumer credit reporting 
agencies and referral to collection agencies, may be utilized to obtain 
payment.
    (j) Waiver or reduction of charges. Fees otherwise chargeable in 
connection with a request for disclosure of a record shall be waived or 
reduced where--
    (1) It is determined that disclosure is in the public interest 
because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding 
of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily 
in the commercial interest of the requester; or
    (2) It is determined that the cost of collection would be equal to 
or exceed the amount of such fees. No charges shall be assessed if such 
fees amount to $8.00 or less.

    (2) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
the Commission;
    (3) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by 
statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552) provided that such statute (i)

as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (ii) establishes particular 
criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be 
withheld;
    (4) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information 
obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;
    (5) Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring 
any person;

constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
    (7) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement 
purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such 
records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or 
information would (i) interfere with enforcement proceedings, (ii) 
deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial 
adjudication, (iii) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy, (iv) disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the 
case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the 
course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful 
national security intelligence investigation, confidential information 
furnished only by the confidential source, (v) disclose investigative 
techniques and procedures, or (vi) endanger the life or physical safety 
of law enforcement personnel;
    (8) Disclose information contained in or related to examination, 
operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the 
use of the Commission;
    (9) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be 
likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed action of 
the Commission, provided the Commission has not already disclosed to the 
public the content or nature of its proposed action, or is not required 
by law to make such disclosure on its own initiative prior to taking 
final action on such proposal; or
    (10) Specifically concern the Commission's issuance of a subpoena or 
the Commission's participation in a civil action or proceeding, an 
action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, 
or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the Commission of a

<R05>
Sec. 601.1  Purpose.

    Pursuant to Executive Order 12958 and Information Security Oversight 
Office Directive No. 1, the National Science Foundation [Foundation] 
issues the following regulations. The regulations identify the 
information to be protected, prescribe classification, declassification, 
downgrading, and safeguarding procedures to be followed, and establish a 
monitoring system to ensure the regulations' effectiveness.

[47 FR 57284, Dec. 23, 1983, as amended at 61 FR 51021, Sept. 30, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 601.2  Classification authority.

    The Foundation does not have original classification authority under 
Executive Order 12958. In any instance where a Foundation employee 
develops information that appears to warrant classification because of 
its national security character, the material will be afforded 
protection and sent to the Division of Administrative Services (DAS). 
Upon determination that classification is warranted, DAS will submit 
such material to the agency that has appropriate subject matter interest 
and classification authority.

[47 FR 57284, Dec. 23, 1983, as amended at 61 FR 51021, Sept. 30, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 601.3  Security program.

    The Director, Division of Administrative Services, is responsible 
for conducting a security program that ensures effective implementation 
of Executive Order 12958, to include:
    (a) Maintaining active training and orientation programs for 
employees concerned with classified information or material.
    (b) Encouraging Foundation personnel to challenge those 
classification decisions they believe to be improper.
    (c) Issuing directives that ensure classified information is used, 
processed, stored, reproduced and transmitted only under conditions that 
will provide adequate protection and prevent access by unauthorized 
persons.
    (d) Recommending to the Director appropriate administrative action 
to correct abuse or violation of any provision of these regulations, 
including notification by warning letters, formal reprimand, and to the 
extent permitted by law, suspension without pay and removal.

[47 FR 57284, Dec. 23, 1983, as amended at 61 FR 51021, Sept. 30, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 601.4  Classification Review Committee.

    The Security Officer (Information) chairs the Foundation's 
Classification Review Committee which has authority to act on all 
suggestions and complaints with respect to the Foundation's 
administration of the regulations. The Assistant Directors and the Heads 
of other offices reporting to the Director serve as members of the 
Committee. All suggestions and complaints including those regarding 
overclassification, failure to classify, or delay in declassifying not 
otherwise resolved, shall be referred to the Committee for resolution. 
The Committee shall establish procedures to review and act within 30 
days upon all appeals regarding requests for declassification. The 
Committee is authorized to overrule previous determinations in whole or 
in part when in its judgment, continued protection is no longer 
required. If the Committee determines that continued classification is 
required under the criteria of the Executive Order, it shall promptly so 
notify the requester and advise him that he may file an application for 
review with the Foundation. In addition, the Committee shall review all 
appeals of requests for records

[[Page 42]]

under section 552 of title 5 U.S.C. (Freedom of Information Act) when 
the proposed denial is based on their continued classification under 
Executive Order 12958.

[47 FR 57284, Dec. 23, 1983, as amended at 61 FR 51021, Sept. 30, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 601.5  Derivative classification.

    Distinct from ``original'' classification is the determination that 
information is in substance the same as information currently 
classified, because of incorporating, paraphrasing, restating or 
generating in new form information that is already classified, and 
marking the newly developed material consistent with the marking of the 
source information. Persons who only reproduce, extract, or summarize 
classified information, or who only apply classification markings 
derived from source material or as directed by a classification guide, 
need not possess original classification authority.
    (a) If a person who applies derivative classification markings 
believes that the paraphrasing, restating, or summarizing of classified 
information has changed the level of or removed the basis for 
classification, that person must consult for a determination an 
appropriate official of the originating agency or office of origin who 
has the authority to upgrade, downgrade, or declassify the information.
    (b) The person who applies derivative classification markings shall 
observe and respect original classification decisions; and carry forward 
to any newly created documents any assigned authorized markings. The 
declassification date or event that provides the longest period of 
classification shall be used for documents classified on the basis of 
multiple sources.


<R05>
Sec. 601.6  Downgrading and declassification.

    Executive Order 12958 prescribes a uniform system for classifying, 
declassifying, and safeguarding national security information.
    (a) Information shall be declassified or downgraded as soon as 
national security considerations permit. The National Science Foundation 
shall coordinate their review of classified information with other 
agencies that have a direct interests in the subject matter. Information 
that continues to meet the classification requirements prescribed by 
Section 1.3 despite the passage of time will continue to be protected in 
accordance with Executive Order 12958.
    (b) Foundation documents may be declassified or downgraded by the 
official who authorized the original classification, if that official is 
still serving in the same position; the originator's successor; a 
supervisory official of either; or officials delegated such authority in 
writing by the Director.
    (c) The Director shall conduct internal systematic review programs 
for classified information originated by the Foundation contained in 
records determined by the Archivist to be permanently valuable but that 
have not been accessioned into the National Archives of the United 
States.
    (d) The Archivist of the United States shall, in accordance with 
procedures and timeframes prescribed in the Information Security 
Oversight Office's directives implementing Executive Order 12958, 
systematically review for declassification or downgrading, classified 
records accessioned into the National Archives of the United States. 
Such information shall be reviewed by the Archivist for declassification 
or downgrading in accordance with systematic review guidelines that 
shall be provided by the head of the agency that originated the 
information, or in the case of foreign government information, by the 
Director of Information Security Oversight Office in consultation with 
interested agency heads.

[47 FR 57284, Dec. 23, 1983, as amended at 61 FR 51021, Sept. 30, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 601.7  Mandatory declassification review.

    (a) The Division of Administrative Services is hereby designated as 
the office to which members of the public or Departments may direct 
requests for mandatory review for declassification under this provision. 
In the case of documents originally classified by the Foundation, this 
office shall, in turn, assign the request to the appropriate office for 
action within 60 days. In each instance, receipt of the request will be 
acknowledged in writing immediately

[[Page 43]]

by the office that has been assigned action. A request for 
classification review must reasonably describe the document.
    (b) Whenever a request is deficient in its description of the record 
sought, the requester should be asked to provide additional identifying 
information to the extent possible. Whenever a request does not 
reasonably describe the information sought, the requester shall be 
notified that unless additional information is provided or the scope of 
the request is narrowed, no further action will be undertaken. Upon a 
determination that the requested material no longer warrants 
classification, it shall be declassified and made promptly available to 
the requester, if not otherwise exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 
552(b) (Freedom of Information Act) or other provision of law. If the 
information may not be released in whole or in part the requester shall 
be given a brief statement as to the reasons for denial, a notice of the 
right to appeal the determination of the Classification Review 
Committee, and a notice that such an appeal must be filed with the 
Foundation within 60 days in order to be considered.
    (c) When the request relates to a document given derivative 
classification by the Foundation or originated by another agency, the 
request and the document will be forwarded to the originator of the 
source document, and the requestor notified of such referral.
    (d) Employees presently cleared for access to classified information 
are encouraged to challenge classification in cases where there is 
reasonable cause to believe that information is classified 
unnecessarily, improperly, or for an inappropriate period of time. Such 
challenges should be brought to the attention of the Security Officer 
(Information) who will act thereon within 30 days, informing the 
challenger of actions taken. Requests for confidentiality will be 
honored.


<R05>
Sec. 601.8  Access to classified materials.

    No person may be given access to classified information unless that 
person has been determined to be trustworthy and unless access is 
essential to the accomplishment of lawful and authorized Government 
purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 601.9  Access by historical researchers and former Presidential appointees.

    The requirement in Sec. 601.8 that access to classified information 
may be granted only as is essential to the accomplishment of lawful and 
authorized Government purposes may be waived for persons who are engaged 
in historical research projects, or previously have occupied 
policymaking positions to which they were appointed by the President, 
provided they execute written agreements to safeguard the information 
and written consent to the Foundation's review of their notes and 
manuscripts solely for the purpose of determining that no classified 
information is disclosed. A precondition to any such access is the 
favorable completion of an appropriate investigative inquiry.

<R05>
Sec. 602.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Accrued expenditures mean the charges incurred by the grantee during 
a given period requiring the provision of funds for:
    (1) Goods and other tangible property received;
    (2) Services performed by employees, contractors, subgrantees, 
subcontractors, and other payees; and
    (3) Other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current 
services or performance is required, such as annuities, insurance 
claims, and other benefit payments.
    Accrued income means the sum of:
    (1) Earnings during a given period from services performed by the 
grantee and goods and other tangible property delivered to purchasers, 
and
    (2) Amounts becoming owed to the grantee for which no current 
services or performance is required by the grantee.
    Acquisition cost of an item of purchased equipment means the net 
invoice unit price of the property including the cost of modifications, 
attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the 
property usable for the purpose for which it was acquired. Other charges 
such as the cost of installation, transportation, taxes, duty or 
protective in-transit insurance, shall be included or excluded from the 
unit acquisition cost in accordance with the grantee's regular 
accounting practices.
    Administrative requirements mean those matters common to grants in 
general, such as financial management, kinds and frequency of reports, 
and retention of records. These are distinguished from programmatic 
requirements, which concern matters that can be treated only on a 
program-by-program or grant-by-grant basis, such as kinds of activities 
that can be supported by grants under a particular program.
    Awarding agency means (1) with respect to a grant, the Federal 
agency, and (2) with respect to a subgrant, the party that awarded the 
subgrant.
    Cash contributions means the grantee's cash outlay, including the 
outlay of money contributed to the grantee or subgrantee by other public 
agencies and institutions, and private organizations and individuals. 
When authorized by Federal legislation, Federal funds received from 
other assistance agreements may be considered as grantee or subgrantee 
cash contributions.
    Contract means (except as used in the definitions for grant and 
subgrant in this section and except where qualified by Federal) a 
procurement contract under a grant or subgrant, and means a procurement 
subcontract under a contract.

[[Page 45]]

    Cost sharing or matching means the value of the third party in-kind 
contributions and the portion of the costs of a federally assisted 
project or program not borne by the Federal Government.
    Cost-type contract means a contract or subcontract under a grant in 
which the contractor or subcontractor is paid on the basis of the costs 
it incurs, with or without a fee.
    Equipment means tangible, nonexpendable, personal property having a 
useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or 
more per unit. A grantee may use its own definition of equipment 
provided that such definition would at least include all equipment 
defined above.
    Expenditure report means: (1) For nonconstruction grants, the SF-269

Reimbursement'' (or other equivalent report).
    Federally recognized Indian tribal government means the governing 
body or a governmental agency of any Indian tribe, band, nation, or 
other organized group or community (including any Native village as 
defined in section 3 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, 85 
Stat. 688) certified by the Secretary of the Interior as eligible for 
the special programs and services provided by him through the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs.
    Government means a State or local government or a federally 
recognized Indian tribal government.
    Grant means an award of financial assistance, including cooperative 
agreements, in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, by the 
Federal Government to an eligible grantee. The term does not include 
technical assistance which provides services instead of money, or other 
assistance in the form of revenue sharing, loans, loan guarantees, 
interest subsidies, insurance, or direct appropriations. Also, the term 
does not include assistance, such as a fellowship or other lump sum 
award, which the grantee is not required to account for.
    Grantee means the government to which a grant is awarded and which 
is accountable for the use of the funds provided. The grantee is the 
entire legal entity even if only a particular component of the entity is 
designated in the grant award document.
    Local government means a county, municipality, city, town, township, 
local public authority (including any public and Indian housing agency 
under the United States Housing Act of 1937) school district, special 
district, intrastate district, council of governments (whether or not 
incorporated as a nonprofit corporation under state law), any other 
regional or interstate government entity, or any agency or 
instrumentality of a local government.
    Obligations means the amounts of orders placed, contracts and 
subgrants awarded, goods and services received, and similar transactions 
during a given period that will require payment by the grantee during 
the same or a future period.
    OMB means the United States Office of Management and Budget.
    Outlays (expenditures) mean charges made to the project or program. 
They may be reported on a cash or accrual basis. For reports prepared on 
a cash basis, outlays are the sum of actual cash disbursement for direct 
charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense incurred, 
the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the amount of cash 
advances and payments made to contractors and subgrantees. For reports 
prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, outlays are the sum of actual 
cash disbursements, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value 
of inkind contributions applied, and the new increase (or decrease) in 
the amounts owed by the grantee for goods and other property received,

subcontractors, and other payees, and other amounts becoming owed under 
programs for which no current services or performance are required, such 
as annuities, insurance claims, and other benefit payments.
    Percentage of completion method refers to a system under which 
payments are made for construction work according to the percentage of 
completion of the work, rather than to the grantee's cost incurred.

[[Page 46]]

    Prior approval means documentation evidencing consent prior to 
incurring specific cost.
    Real property means land, including land improvements, structures 
and appurtenances thereto, excluding movable machinery and equipment.
    Share, when referring to the awarding agency's portion of real 
property, equipment or supplies, means the same percentage as the 
awarding agency's portion of the acquiring party's total costs under the 
grant to which the acquisition costs under the grant to which the 
acquisition cost of the property was charged. Only costs are to be 
counted--not the value of third-party in-kind contributions.
    State means any of the several States of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or 
possession of the United States, or any agency or instrumentality of a 
State exclusive of local governments. The term does not include any 
public and Indian housing agency under United States Housing Act of 
1937.
    Subgrant means an award of financial assistance in the form of 
money, or property in lieu of money, made under a grant by a grantee to 
an eligible subgrantee. The term includes financial assistance when 
provided by contractual legal agreement, but does not include 
procurement purchases, nor does it include any form of assistance which 
is excluded from the definition of grant in this part.
    Subgrantee means the government or other legal entity to which a 
subgrant is awarded and which is accountable to the grantee for the use 
of the funds provided.
    Supplies means all tangible personal property other than equipment 
as defined in this part.
    Suspension means depending on the context, either (1) temporary 
withdrawal of the authority to obligate grant funds pending corrective 
action by the grantee or subgrantee or a decision to terminate the 
grant, or (2) an action taken by a suspending official in accordance 
with agency regulations implementing E.O. 12549 to immediately exclude a 
person from participating in grant transactions for a period, pending 
completion of an investigation and such legal or debarment proceedings 
as may ensue.
    Termination means permanent withdrawal of the authority to obligate 
previously-awarded grant funds before that authority would otherwise 
expire. It also means the voluntary relinquishment of that authority by 
the grantee or subgrantee. Termination does not include: (1) Withdrawal 
of funds awarded on the basis of the grantee's underestimate of the 
unobligated balance in a prior period; (2) Withdrawal of the unobligated 
balance as of the expiration of a grant; (3) Refusal to extend a grant 
or award additional funds, to make a competing or noncompeting 
continuation, renewal, extension, or supplemental award; or (4) voiding 
of a grant upon determination that the award was obtained fraudulently, 
or was otherwise illegal or invalid from inception.
    Terms of a grant or subgrant mean all requirements of the grant or 
subgrant, whether in statute, regulations, or the award document.
    Third party in-kind contributions mean property or services which 
benefit a federally assisted project or program and which are 
contributed by non-Federal third parties without charge to the grantee, 
or a cost-type contractor under the grant agreement.
    Unliquidated obligations for reports prepared on a cash basis mean 
the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee that has not been 
paid. For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, they 
represent the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee for which an 
outlay has not been recorded.
    Unobligated balance means the portion of the funds authorized by the 
Federal agency that has not been obligated by the grantee and is 
determined by deducting the cumulative obligations from the cumulative 
funds authorized.

except for 20 U.S.C. 238(d)(2)(c) and 240(f) (Entitlement Increase for 
Handicapped Children); and
    (10) Payments under the Veterans Administration's State Home Per 
Diem Program (38 U.S.C. 641(a)).
    (b) Entitlement programs. Entitlement programs enumerated above in 
Sec. 602.4(a) (3) through (8) are subject to Subpart E.


<R05>
Sec. 602.5  Effect on other issuances.

    All other grants administration provisions of codified program 
regulations, program manuals, handbooks and other nonregulatory 
materials which are inconsistent with this part are superseded, except 
to the extent they are required by statute, or authorized in accordance 
with the exception provision in Sec. 602.6.


<R05>
Sec. 602.6  Additions and exceptions.

    (a) For classes of grants and grantees subject to this part, Federal 
agencies may not impose additional administrative requirements except in 
codified

[[Page 48]]

regulations published in the Federal Register.
    (b) Exceptions for classes of grants or grantees may be authorized 
only by OMB.
    (c) Exceptions on a case-by-case basis and for subgrantees may be 
authorized by the affected Federal agencies.


<R04>
                    Subpart B--Pre-Award Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 602.10  Forms for applying for grants.

    (a) Scope. (1) This section prescribes forms and instructions to be 
used by governmental organizations (except hospitals and institutions of 
higher education operated by a government) in applying for grants. This 
section is not applicable, however, to formula grant programs which do 
not require applicants to apply for funds on a project basis.
    (2) This section applies only to applications to Federal agencies 
for grants, and is not required to be applied by grantees in dealing 
with applicants for subgrants. However, grantees are encouraged to avoid 
more detailed or burdensome application requirements for subgrants.
    (b) Authorized forms and instructions for governmental 
organizations. (1) In applying for grants, applicants shall only use 
standard application forms or those prescribed by the granting agency 
with the approval of OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
    (2) Applicants are not required to submit more than the original and 
two copies of preapplications or applications.
    (3) Applicants must follow all applicable instructions that bear OMB 
clearance numbers. Federal agencies may specify and describe the 
programs, functions, or activities that will be used to plan, budget, 
and evaluate the work under a grant. Other supplementary instructions 
may be issued only with the approval of OMB to the extent required under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. For any standard form, except the 
SF-424 facesheet, Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the 
applicant to disregard any line item that is not needed.
    (4) When a grantee applies for additional funding (such as a 
continuation or supplemental award) or amends a previously submitted 
application, only the affected pages need be submitted. Previously 
submitted pages with information that is still current need not be 
resubmitted.


<R05>
Sec. 602.11  State plans.

    (a) Scope. The statutes for some programs require States to submit 
plans before receiving grants. Under regulations implementing Executive 
Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' States 
are allowed to simplify, consolidate and substitute plans. This section 
contains additional provisions for plans that are subject to regulations 
implementing the Executive order.
    (b) Requirements. A State need meet only Federal administrative or 
programmatic requirements for a plan that are in statutes or codified 
regulations.
    (c) Assurances. In each plan the State will include an assurance 
that the State shall comply with all applicable Federal statutes and 
regulations in effect with respect to the periods for which it receives 
grant funding. For this assurance and other assurances required in the 
plan, the State may:
    (1) Cite by number the statutory or regulatory provisions requiring 
the assurances and affirm that it gives the assurances required by those 
provisions,
    (2) Repeat the assurance language in the statutes or regulations, or
    (3) Develop its own language to the extent permitted by law.
    (d) Amendments. A State will amend a plan whenever necessary to 
reflect: (1) New or revised Federal statutes or regulations or (2) a 
material change in any State law, organization, policy, or State agency 
operation. The State will obtain approval for the amendment and its 
effective date but need submit for approval only the amended portions of 
the plan.


<R05>
Sec. 602.12  Special grant or subgrant conditions for ``high-risk'' grantees.

    (a) A grantee or subgrantee may be considered ``high risk'' if an 
awarding agency determines that a grantee or subgrantee:

[[Page 49]]

    (1) Has a history of unsatisfactory performance, or
    (2) Is not financially stable, or
    (3) Has a management system which does not meet the management 
standards set forth in this part, or
    (4) Has not conformed to terms and conditions of previous awards, or
    (5) Is otherwise not responsible; and if the awarding agency 
determines that an award will be made, special conditions and/or 
restrictions shall correspond to the high risk condition and shall be 
included in the award.
    (b) Special conditions or restrictions may include:
    (1) Payment on a reimbursement basis;
    (2) Withholding authority to proceed to the next phase until receipt 
of evidence of acceptable performance within a given funding period;
    (3) Requiring additional, more detailed financial reports;
    (4) Additional project monitoring;
    (5) Requiring the grantee or subgrantee to obtain technical or 
management assistance; or
    (6) Establishing additional prior approvals.
    (c) If an awarding agency decides to impose such conditions, the 
awarding official will notify the grantee or subgrantee as early as 
possible, in writing, of:
    (1) The nature of the special conditions/restrictions;
    (2) The reason(s) for imposing them;
    (3) The corrective actions which must be taken before they will be 
removed and the time allowed for completing the corrective actions and
    (4) The method of requesting reconsideration of the conditions/
restrictions imposed.


<R04>
                   Subpart C--Post-Award Requirements

                        Financial Administration


<R05>
Sec. 602.20  Standards for financial management systems.

    (a) A State must expand and account for grant funds in accordance 
with State laws and procedures for expending and accounting for its own 
funds. Fiscal control and accounting procedures of the State, as well as 
its subgrantees and cost-type contractors, must be sufficient to--
    (1) Permit preparation of reports required by this part and the 
statutes authorizing the grant, and
    (2) Permit the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate 
to establish that such funds have not been used in violation of the 
restrictions and prohibitions of applicable statutes.
    (b) The financial management systems of other grantees and 
subgrantees must meet the following standards:
    (1) Financial reporting. Accurate, current, and complete disclosure 
of the financial results of financially assisted activities must be made 
in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the grant or 
subgrant.
    (2) Accounting records. Grantees and subgrantees must maintain 
records which adequately identify the source and application of funds 
provided for financially-assisted activities. These records must contain 
information pertaining to grant or subgrant awards and authorizations, 
obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays or 
expenditures, and income.
    (3) Internal control. Effective control and accountability must be 
maintained for all grant and subgrant cash, real and personal property, 
and other assets. Grantees and subgrantees must adequately safeguard all 
such property and must assure that it is used solely for authorized 
purposes.
    (4) Budget control. Actual expenditures or outlays must be compared 
with budgeted amounts for each grant or subgrant. Financial information 
must be related to performance or productivity data, including the 
development of unit cost information whenever appropriate or 
specifically required in the grant or subgrant agreement. If unit cost 
data are required, estimates based on available documentation will be 
accepted whenever possible.
    (5) Allowable cost. Applicable OMB cost principles, agency program 
regulations, and the terms of grant and subgrant agreements will be 
followed in determining the reasonableness, allowability, and 
allocability of costs.
    (6) Source documentation. Accounting records must be supported by 
such source documentation as cancelled

[[Page 50]]

checks, paid bills, payrolls, time and attendance records, contract and 
subgrant award documents, etc.
    (7) Cash management. Procedures for minimizing the time elapsing 
between the transfer of funds from the U.S. Treasury and disbursement by 
grantees and subgrantees must be followed whenever advance payment 
procedures are used. Grantees must establish reasonable procedures to 
ensure the receipt of reports on subgrantees' cash balances and cash 
disbursements in sufficient time to enable them to prepare complete and 
accurate cash transactions reports to the awarding agency. When advances 
are made by letter-of-credit or electronic transfer of funds methods, 
the grantee must make drawdowns as close as possible to the time of 
making disbursements. Grantees must monitor cash drawdowns by their 
subgrantees to assure that they conform substantially to the same 
standards of timing and amount as apply to advances to the grantees.
    (c) An awarding agency may review the adequacy of the financial 
management system of any applicant for financial assistance as part of a 
preaward review or at any time subsequent to award.


<R05>
Sec. 602.21  Payment.

    (a) Scope. This section prescribes the basic standard and the 
methods under which a Federal agency will make payments to grantees, and 
grantees will make payments to subgrantees and contractors.
    (b) Basic standard. Methods and procedures for payment shall 
minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and 
disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee, in accordance with Treasury 
regulations at 31 CFR part 205.
    (c) Advances. Grantees and subgrantees shall be paid in advance, 
provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness and ability to 
maintain procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer 
of the funds and their disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee.
    (d) Reimbursement. Reimbursement shall be the preferred method when 
the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section are not met. Grantees 
and subgrantees may also be paid by reimbursement for any construction 
grant. Except as otherwise specified in regulation, Federal agencies 
shall not use the percentage of completion method to pay construction 
grants. The grantee or subgrantee may use that method to pay its 
construction contractor, and if it does, the awarding agency's payments 
to the grantee or subgrantee will be based on the grantee's or 
subgrantee's actual rate of disbursement.
    (e) Working capital advances. If a grantee cannot meet the criteria 
for advance payments described in paragraph (c) of this section, and the 
Federal agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because 
the grantee lacks sufficient working capital, the awarding agency may 
provide cash or a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure 
the awarding agency shall advance cash to the grantee to cover its 
estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to 
the grantee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the awarding agency shall 
reimburse the grantee for its actual cash disbursements. The working 
capital advance method of payment shall not be used by grantees or 
subgrantees if the reason for using such method is the unwillingness or 
inability of the grantee to provide timely advances to the subgrantee to 
meet the subgrantee's actual cash disbursements.
    (f) Effect of program income, refunds, and audit recoveries on 
payment. (1) Grantees and subgrantees shall disburse repayments to and 
interest earned on a revolving fund before requesting additional cash 
payments for the same activity.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, grantees 
and subgrantees shall disburse program income, rebates, refunds, 
contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds 
before requesting additional cash payments.
    (g) Withholding payments. (1) Unless otherwise required by Federal 
statute, awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper 
charges incurred by grantees or subgrantees unless--
    (i) The grantee or subgrantee has failed to comply with grant award 
conditions or

[[Page 51]]

    (ii) The grantee or subgrantee is indebted to the United States.
    (2) Cash withheld for failure to comply with grant award condition, 
but without suspension of the grant, shall be released to the grantee 
upon subsequent compliance. When a grant is suspended, payment 
adjustments will be made in accordance with Sec. 602.43(c).
    (3) A Federal agency shall not make payment to grantees for amounts 
that are withheld by grantees or subgrantees from payment to contractors 
to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payments shall be made by the 
Federal agency when the grantees or subgrantees actually disburse the 
withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to 
assure satisfactory completion of work.
    (h) Cash depositories. (1) Consistent with the national goal of 
expanding the opportunities for minority business enterprises, grantees 
and subgrantees are encouraged to use minority banks (a bank which is 
owned at least 50 percent by minority group members). A list of minority 
owned banks can be obtained from the Minority Business Development 
Agency, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230.
    (2) A grantee or subgrantee shall maintain a separate bank account 
only when required by Federal-State agreement.
    (i) Interest earned on advances. Except for interest earned on 
advances of funds exempt under the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 
U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) and the Indian Self-Determination Act (23 U.S.C. 
450), grantees and subgrantees shall promptly, but at least quarterly, 
remit interest earned on advances to the Federal agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee may keep interest amounts up to $100 per year for 
administrative expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 602.22  Allowable costs.

    (a) Limitation on use of funds. Grant funds may be used only for:
    (1) The allowable costs of the grantees, subgrantees and cost-type 
contractors, including allowable costs in the form of payments to fixed-
price contractors; and
    (2) Reasonable fees or profit to cost-type contractors but not any 
fee or profit (or other increment above allowable costs) to the grantee 
or subgrantee.
    (b) Applicable cost principles. For each kind of organization, there 
is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. 
Allowable costs will be determined in accordance with the cost 
principles applicable to the organization incurring the costs. The 
following chart lists the kinds of organizations and the applicable cost 
principles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 602.23  Period of availability of funds.

    (a) General. Where a funding period is specified, a grantee may 
charge to the award only costs resulting from obligations of the funding 
period unless carryover of unobligated balances is permitted, in which 
case the carryover balances may be charged for costs resulting from 
obligations of the subsequent funding period.
    (b) Liquidation of obligations. A grantee must liquidate all 
obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 days after the 
end of the funding period (or as specified in a program regulation) to 
coincide with the submission of the annual Financial Status Report (SF-
269). The Federal agency may extend this deadline at the request of the 
grantee.


<R05>
Sec. 602.24  Matching or cost sharing.

    (a) Basic rule: Costs and contributions acceptable. With the 
qualifications and exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, a 
matching or cost sharing requirement may be satisfied by either or both 
of the following:

[[Page 52]]

    (1) Allowable costs incurred by the grantee, subgrantee or a cost-
type contractor under the assistance agreement. This includes allowable 
costs borne by non-Federal grants or by others cash donations from non-
Federal third parties.
    (2) The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to the 
period to which the cost sharing or matching requirements applies.
    (b) Qualifications and exceptions--(1) Costs borne by other Federal 
grant agreements. Except as provided by Federal statute, a cost sharing 
or matching requirement may not be met by costs borne by another Federal 
grant. This prohibition does not apply to income earned by a grantee or 
subgrantee from a contract awarded under another Federal grant.
    (2) General revenue sharing. For the purpose of this section, 
general revenue sharing funds distributed under 31 U.S.C. 6702 are not 
considered Federal grant funds.
    (3) Cost or contributions counted towards other Federal costs-
sharing requirements. Neither costs nor the values of third party in-
kind contributions may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or 
matching requirement of a grant agreement if they have been or will be 
counted towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of 
another Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement contract, or any 
other award of Federal funds.
    (4) Costs financed by program income. Costs financed by program 
income, as defined in Sec. 602.25, shall not count towards satisfying a 
cost sharing or matching requirement unless they are expressly permitted 
in the terms of the assistance agreement. (This use of general program 
income is described in Sec. 602.25(g).)
    (5) Services or property financed by income earned by contractors. 
Contractors under a grant may earn income from the activities carried 
out under the contract in addition to the amounts earned from the party 
awarding the contract. No costs of services or property supported by 
this income may count toward satisfying a cost sharing or matching 
requirement unless other provisions of the grant agreement expressly 
permit this kind of income to be used to meet the requirement.
    (6) Records. Costs and third party in-kind contributions counting 
towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement must be 
verifiable from the records of grantees and subgrantee or cost-type 
contractors. These records must show how the value placed on third party 
in-kind contributions was derived. To the extent feasible, volunteer 
services will be supported by the same methods that the organization 
uses to support the allocability of regular personnel costs.
    (7) Special standards for third party in-kind contributions. (i) 
Third party in-kind contributions count towards satisfying a cost 
sharing or matching requirement only where, if the party receiving the 
contributions were to pay for them, the payments would be allowable 
costs.
    (ii) Some third party in-kind contributions are goods and services 
that, if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor receiving the 
contribution had to pay for them, the payments would have been an 
indirect costs. Costs sharing or matching credit for such contributions 
shall be given only if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor has 
established, along with its regular indirect cost rate, a special rate 
for allocating to individual projects or programs the value of the 
contributions.
    (iii) A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed-price contract 
may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only 
if it results in:
    (A) An increase in the services or property provided under the 
contract (without additional cost to the grantee or subgrantee) or
    (B) A cost savings to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (iv) The values placed on third party in-kind contributions for cost 
sharing or matching purposes will conform to the rules in the succeeding 
sections of this part. If a third party in-kind contribution is a type 
not treated in those sections, the value placed upon it shall be fair 
and reasonable.

[[Page 53]]

    (c) Valuation of donated services--(1) Volunteer services. Unpaid 
services provided to a grantee or subgrantee by individuals will be 
valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work 
in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. If the grantee or 
subgrantee does not have employees performing similar work, the rates 
will be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for 
similar work in the same labor market. In either case, a reasonable 
amount for fringe benefits may be included in the valuation.
    (2) Employees of other organizations. When an employer other than a 
grantee, subgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge 
the services of an employee in the employee's normal line of work, the 
services will be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive 
of the employee's fringe benefits and overhead costs. If the services 
are in a different line of work, paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
applies.
    (d) Valuation of third party donated supplies and loaned equipment 
or space. (1) If a third party donates supplies, the contribution will 
be valued at the market value of the supplies at the time of donation.
    (2) If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a 
building but retains title, the contribution will be valued at the fair 
rental rate of the equipment or space.
    (e) Valuation of third party donated equipment, buildings, and land. 
If a third party donates equipment, buildings, or land, and title passes 
to a grantee or subgrantee, the treatment of the donated property will 
depend upon the purpose of the grant or subgrant, as follows:
    (1) Awards for capital expenditures. If the purpose of the grant or 
subgrant is to assist the grantee or subgrantee in the acquisition of 
property, the market value of that property at the time of donation may 
be counted as cost sharing or matching,
    (2) Other awards. If assisting in the acquisition of property is not 
the purpose of the grant or subgrant, paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of 
this section apply:
    (i) If approval is obtained from the awarding agency, the market 
value at the time of donation of the donated equipment or buildings and 
the fair rental rate of the donated land may be counted as cost sharing 
or matching. In the case of a subgrant, the terms of the grant agreement 
may require that the approval be obtained from the Federal agency as 
well as the grantee. In all cases, the approval may be given only if a 
purchase of the equipment or rental of the land would be approved as an 
allowable direct cost. If any part of the donated property was acquired 
with Federal funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be 
counted as cost-sharing or matching.
    (ii) If approval is not obtained under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this 
section, no amount may be counted for donated land, and only 
depreciation or use allowances may be counted for donated equipment and 
buildings. The depreciation or use allowances for this property are not 
treated as third party in-kind contributions. Instead, they are treated 
as costs incurred by the grantee or subgrantee. They are computed and 
allocated (usually as indirect costs) in accordance with the cost 
principles specified in Sec. 602.22, in the same way as depreciation or 
use allowances for purchased equipment and buildings. The amount of 
depreciation or use allowances for donated equipment and buildings is 
based on the property's market value at the time it was donated.
    (f) Valuation of grantee or subgrantee donated real property for 
construction/acquisition. If a grantee or subgrantee donates real 
property for a construction or facilities acquisition project, the 
current market value of that property may be counted as cost sharing or 
matching. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal 
funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be counted as cost 
sharing or matching.
    (g) Appraisal of real property. In some cases under paragraphs (d), 
(e) and (f) of this section, it will be necessary to establish the 
market value of land or a building or the fair rental rate of land or of 
space in a building. In these cases, the Federal agency may require the 
market value or fair rental value be set by an independent appraiser, 
and that the value or rate be certified by the

[[Page 54]]

grantee. This requirement will also be imposed by the grantee on 
subgrantees.


<R05>
Sec. 602.25  Program income.

    (a) General. Grantees are encouraged to earn income to defray 
program costs. Program income includes income from fees for services 
performed, from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired 
with grant funds, from the sale of commodities or items fabricated under 
a grant agreement, and from payments of principal and interest on loans 
made with grant funds. Except as otherwise provided in regulations of 
the Federal agency, program income does not include interest on grant 
funds, rebates, credits, discounts, refunds, etc. and interest earned on 
any of them.
    (b) Definition of program income. Program income means gross income 
received by the grantee or subgrantee directly generated by a grant 
supported activity, or earned only as a result of the grant agreement 
during the grant period. ``During the grant period'' is the time between 
the effective date of the award and the ending date of the award 
reflected in the final financial report.
    (c) Cost of generating program income. If authorized by Federal 
regulations or the grant agreement, costs incident to the generation of 
program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program 
income.
    (d) Governmental revenues. Taxes, special assessments, levies, 
fines, and other such revenues raised by a grantee or subgrantee are not 
program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the 
grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income.
    (e) Royalties. Income from royalties and license fees for 
copyrighted material, patents, and inventions developed by a grantee or 
subgrantee is program income only if the revenues are specifically 
identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as 
program income. (See Sec. 602.34.)
    (f) Property. Proceeds from the sale of real property or equipment 
will be handled in accordance with the requirements of Secs. 602.31 and 
602.32.
    (g) Use of program income. Program income shall be deducted from 
outlays which may be both Federal and non-Federal as described below, 
unless the Federal agency regulations or the grant agreement specify 
another alternative (or a combination of the alternatives). In 
specifying alternatives, the Federal agency may distinguish between 
income earned by the grantee and income earned by subgrantees and 
between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income. When Federal agencies 
authorize the alternatives in paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) of this 
section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall also be 
deducted from outlays.
    (1) Deduction. Ordinarily program income shall be deducted from 
total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program 
income shall be used for current costs unless the Federal agency 
authorizes otherwise. Program income which the grantee did not 
anticipate at the time of the award shall be used to reduce the Federal 
agency and grantee contributions rather than to increase the funds 
committed to the project.
    (2) Addition. When authorized, program income may be added to the 
funds committed to the grant agreement by the Federal agency and the 
grantee. The program income shall be used for the purposes and under the 
conditions of the grant agreement.
    (3) Cost sharing or matching. When authorized, program income may be 
used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the grant 
agreement. The amount of the Federal grant award remains the same.
    (h) Income after the award period. There are no Federal requirements 
governing the disposition of program income earned after the end of the 
award period (i.e., until the ending date of the final financial report, 
see paragraph (a) of this section), unless the terms of the agreement or 
the Federal agency regulations provide otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 602.26  Non-Federal audit.

    (a) Basic rule. Grantees and subgrantees are responsible for 
obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 
1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits of 
States, Local

[[Page 55]]

Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.'' The audits shall be made by 
an independent auditor in accordance with generally accepted government 
auditing standards covering financial audits.
    (b) Subgrantees. State or local governments, as those terms are 
defined for purposes of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, that 
provide Federal awards to a subgrantee, which expends $300,000 or more 
(or other amount as specified by OMB) in Federal awards in a fiscal 
year, shall:
    (1) Determine whether State or local subgrantees have met the audit 
requirements of the Act and whether subgrantees covered by OMB Circular 
A-110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements 
with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit 
Organizations,'' have met the audit requirements of the Act. Commercial 
contractors (private for-profit and private and governmental 
organizations) providing goods and services to State and local 
governments are not required to have a single audit performed. State and 
local governments should use their own procedures to ensure that the 
contractor has complied with laws and regulations affecting the 
expenditure of Federal funds;
    (2) Determine whether the subgrantee spent Federal assistance funds 
provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be 
accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subgrantee made in accordance 
with the Act, Circular A-110, or through other means (e.g., program 
reviews) if the subgrantee has not had such an audit;
    (3) Ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken within six 
months after receipt of the audit report in instance of noncompliance 
with Federal laws and regulations;
    (4) Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate adjustment of the 
grantee's own records; and
    (5) Require each subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have 
access to the records and financial statements.
    (c) Auditor selection. In arranging for audit services, Sec. 602.36 
shall be followed.

                    Changes, Property, and Subawards


<R05>
Sec. 602.30  Changes.

    (a) General. Grantees and subgrantees are permitted to rebudget 
within the approved direct cost budget to meet unanticipated 
requirements and may make limited program changes to the approved 
project. However, unless waived by the awarding agency, certain types of 
post-award changes in budgets and projects shall require the prior 
written approval of the awarding agency.
    (b) Relation to cost principles. The applicable cost principles (see 
Sec. 602.22) contain requirements for prior approval of certain types of 
costs. Except where waived, those requirements apply to all grants and 
subgrants even if paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section do not.
    (c) Budget changes--(1) Nonconstruction projects. Except as stated 
in other regulations or an award document, grantees or subgrantees shall 
obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the 
following changes is anticipated under a nonconstruction award:
    (i) Any revision which would result in the need for additional 
funding.
    (ii) Unless waived by the awarding agency, cumulative transfers 
among direct cost categories, or, if applicable, among separately 
budgeted programs, projects, functions, or activities which exceed or 
are expected to exceed ten percent of the current total approved budget, 
whenever the awarding agency's share exceeds $100,000.
    (iii) Transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (i.e., from 
direct payments to trainees to other expense categories).
    (2) Construction projects. Grantees and subgrantees shall obtain 
prior written approval for any budget revision which would result in the 
need for additional funds.
    (3) Combined construction and nonconstruction projects. When a grant 
or subgrant provides funding for both construction and nonconstruction 
activities, the grantee or subgrantee must obtain prior written approval 
from the awarding agency before making any

[[Page 56]]

fund or budget transfer from nonconstruction to construction or vice 
versa.
    (d) Programmatic changes. Grantees or subgrantees must obtain the 
prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following 
actions is anticipated:
    (1) Any revision of the scope or objectives of the project 
(regardless of whether there is an associated budget revision requiring 
prior approval).
    (2) Need to extend the period of availability of funds.
    (3) Changes in key persons in cases where specified in an 
application or a grant award. In research projects, a change in the 
project director or principal investigator shall always require approval 
unless waived by the awarding agency.
    (4) Under nonconstruction projects, contracting out, subgranting (if 
authorized by law) or otherwise obtaining the services of a third party 
to perform activities which are central to the purposes of the award. 
This approval requirement is in addition to the approval requirements of 
Sec. 602.36 but does not apply to the procurement of equipment, 
supplies, and general support services.
    (e) Additional prior approval requirements. The awarding agency may 
not require prior approval for any budget revision which is not 
described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) Requesting prior approval. (1) A request for prior approval of 
any budget revision will be in the same budget formal the grantee used 
in its application and shall be accompanied by a narrative justification 
for the proposed revision.
    (2) A request for a prior approval under the applicable Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 602.22) may be made by letter.
    (3) A request by a subgrantee for prior approval will be addressed 
in writing to the grantee. The grantee will promptly review such request 
and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing. A grantee will 
not approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent with 
the purpose or terms and conditions of the Federal grant to the grantee. 
If the revision, requested by the subgrantee would result in a change to 
the grantee's approved project which requires Federal prior approval, 
the grantee will obtain the Federal agency's approval before approving 
the subgrantee's request.


<R05>
Sec. 602.31  Real property.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to real property acquired under a grant or subgrant 
will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Use. Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes, real 
property will be used for the originally authorized purposes as long as 
needed for that purposes, and the grantee or subgrantee shall not 
dispose of or encumber its title or other interests.
    (c) Disposition. When real property is no longer needed for the 
originally authorized purpose, the grantee or subgrantee will request 
disposition instructions from the awarding agency. The instructions will 
provide for one of the following alternatives:
    (1) Retention of title. Retain title after compensating the awarding 
agency. The amount paid to the awarding agency will be computed by 
applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost 
of the original purchase to the fair market value of the property. 
However, in those situations where a grantee or subgrantee is disposing 
of real property acquired with grant funds and acquiring replacement 
real property under the same program, the net proceeds from the 
disposition may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement 
property.
    (2) Sale of property. Sell the property and compensate the awarding 
agency. The amount due to the awarding agency will be calculated by 
applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost 
of the original purchase to the proceeds of the sale after deduction of 
any actual and reasonable selling and fixing-up expenses. If the grant 
is still active, the net proceeds from sale may be offset against the 
original cost of the property. When a grantee or subgrantee is directed 
to sell property, sales procedures shall be followed that provide for 
competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible 
return.

[[Page 57]]

    (3) Transfer of title. Transfer title to the awarding agency or to a 
third-party designated/approved by the awarding agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the grantee or 
subgrantee's percentage of participation in the purchase of the real 
property to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 602.32  Equipment.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) States. A State will use, manage, and dispose of equipment 
acquired under a grant by the State in accordance with State laws and 
procedures. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (c) 
through (e) of this section.
    (c) Use. (1) Equipment shall be used by the grantee or subgrantee in 
the program or project for which it was acquired as long as needed, 
whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by 
Federal funds. When no longer needed for the original program or 
project, the equipment may be used in other activities currently or 
previously supported by a Federal agency.
    (2) The grantee or subgrantee shall also make equipment available 
for use on other projects or programs currently or previously supported 
by the Federal Government, providing such use will not interfere with 
the work on the projects or program for which it was originally 
acquired. First preference for other use shall be given to other 
programs or projects supported by the awarding agency. User fees should 
be considered if appropriate.
    (3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in Sec. 602.25(a) to earn 
program income, the grantee or subgrantee must not use equipment 
acquired with grant funds to provide services for a fee to compete 
unfairly with private companies that provide equivalent services, unless 
specifically permitted or contemplated by Federal statute.
    (4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the grantee or subgrantee 
may use the equipment to be replaced as a trade-in or sell the property 
and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement property, 
subject to the approval of the awarding agency.
    (d) Management requirements. Procedures for managing equipment 
(including replacement equipment), whether acquired in whole or in part 
with grant funds, until disposition takes place will, as a minimum, meet 
the following requirements:
    (1) Property records must be maintained that include a description 
of the property, a serial number or other identification number, the 
source of property, who holds title, the acquisition date, and cost of 
the property, percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the 
property, the location, use and condition of the property, and any 
ultimate disposition data including the date of disposal and sale price 
of the property.
    (2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken and the 
results reconciled with the property records at least once every two 
years.
    (3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards 
to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property. Any loss, damage, or 
theft shall be investigated.
    (4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the 
property in good condition.
    (5) If the grantee or subgrantee is authorized or required to sell 
the property, proper sales procedures must be established to ensure the 
highest possible return.
    (e) Disposition. When original or replacement equipment acquired 
under a grant or subgrant is no longer needed for the original project 
or program or for other activities currently or previously supported by 
a Federal agency, disposition of the equipment will be made as follows:
    (1) Items of equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of 
less than $5,000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no 
further obligation to the awarding agency.
    (2) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value in 
excess of $5,000 may be retained or sold and the awarding agency shall 
have a right to an amount calculated by multiplying

[[Page 58]]

the current market value or proceeds from sale by the awarding agency's 
share of the equipment.
    (3) In cases where a grantee or subgrantee fails to take appropriate 
disposition actions, the awarding agency may direct the grantee or 
subgrantee to take excess and disposition actions.
    (f) Federal equipment. In the event a grantee or subgrantee is 
provided federally-owned equipment:
    (1) Title will remain vested in the Federal Government.
    (2) Grantees or subgrantees will manage the equipment in accordance 
with Federal agency rules and procedures, and submit an annual inventory 
listing.
    (3) When the equipment is no longer needed, the grantee or 
subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the Federal 
agency.
    (g) Right to transfer title. The Federal awarding agency may reserve 
the right to transfer title to the Federal Government or a third part 
named by the awarding agency when such a third party is otherwise 
eligible under existing statutes. Such transfers shall be subject to the 
following standards:
    (1) The property shall be identified in the grant or otherwise made 
known to the grantee in writing.
    (2) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instruction 
within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the 
project for which it was acquired. If the Federal awarding agency fails 
to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar-day period the 
grantee shall follow Sec. 602.32(e).
    (3) When title to equipment is transferred, the grantee shall be 
paid an amount calculated by applying the percentage of participation in 
the purchase to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 602.33  Supplies.

    (a) Title. Title to supplies acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest, upon acquisition, in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Disposition. If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies 
exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate fair market value upon termination 
or completion of the award, and if the supplies are not needed for any 
other federally sponsored programs or projects, the grantee or 
subgrantee shall compensate the awarding agency for its share.


<R05>
Sec. 602.34  Copyrights.

    The Federal awarding agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, 
and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish or otherwise use, and to 
authorize others to use, for Federal Government purposes:
    (a) The copyright in any work developed under a grant, subgrant, or 
contract under a grant or subgrant; and
    (b) Any rights of copyright to which a grantee, subgrantee or a 
contractor purchases ownership with grant support.


<R05>
Sec. 602.35  Subawards to debarred and suspended parties.

    Grantees and subgrantees must not make any award or permit any award 
(subgrant or contract) at any tier to any party which is debarred or 
suspended or is otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation 
in Federal assistance programs under Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment 
and Suspension.''


<R05>
Sec. 602.36  Procurement.

    (a) States. When procuring property and services under a grant, a 
State will follow the same policies and procedures it uses for 
procurements from its non-Federal funds. The State will ensure that 
every purchase order or other contract includes any clauses required by 
Federal statutes and executive orders and their implementing 
regulations. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (b) 
through (i) in this section.
    (b) Procurement standards. (1) Grantees and subgrantees will use 
their own procurement procedures which reflect applicable State and 
local laws and regulations, provided that the procurements conform to 
applicable Federal law and the standards identified in this section.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a contract administration 
system which ensures that contractors perform in accordance with the 
terms,

[[Page 59]]

conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase orders.
    (3) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a written code of 
standards of conduct governing the performance of their employees 
engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, 
officer or agent of the grantee or subgrantee shall participate in 
selection, or in the award or administration of a contract supported by 
Federal funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be 
involved. Such a conflict would arise when:
    (i) The employee, officer or agent,
    (ii) Any member of his immediate family,
    (iii) His or her partner, or
    (iv) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of 
the above, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for 
award. The grantee's or subgrantee's officers, employees or agents will 
neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary 
value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to 
subagreements. Grantee and subgrantees may set minimum rules where the 
financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item 
of nominal intrinsic value. To the extent permitted by State or local 
law or regulations, such standards or conduct will provide for 
penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of 
such standards by the grantee's and subgrantee's officers, employees, or 
agents, or by contractors or their agents. The awarding agency may in 
regulation provide additional prohibitions relative to real, apparent, 
or potential conflicts of interest.
    (4) Grantee and subgrantee procedures will provide for a review of 
proposed procurements to avoid purchase of unnecessary or duplicative 
items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out 
procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an 
analysis will be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any 
other appropriate analysis to determine the most economical approach.
    (5) To foster greater economy and efficiency, grantees and 
subgrantees are encouraged to enter into State and local 
intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common goods and 
services.
    (6) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use Federal excess 
and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property 
whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs.
    (7) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use value engineering 
clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to 
offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is 
a systematic and creative analysis of each contract item or task to 
ensure that its essential function is provided at the overall lower 
cost.
    (8) Grantees and subgrantees will make awards only to responsible 
contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the 
terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be 
given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public 
policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical 
resources.
    (9) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain records sufficient to 
detail the significant history of a procurement. These records will 
include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: rationale for 
the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor 
selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.
    (10) Grantees and subgrantees will use time and material type 
contracts only--
    (i) After a determination that no other contract is suitable, and
    (ii) If the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor 
exceeds at its own risk.
    (11) Grantees and subgrantees alone will be responsible, in 
accordance with good administrative practice and sound business 
judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative 
issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not 
limited to source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. These 
standards do not relieve the grantee or subgrantee of any contractual 
responsibilities under its contracts. Federal agencies will not 
substitute their judgment for

[[Page 60]]

that of the grantee or subgrantee unless the matter is primarily a 
Federal concern. Violations of law will be referred to the local, State, 
or Federal authority having proper jurisdiction.
    (12) Grantees and subgrantees will have protest procedures to handle 
and resolve disputes relating to their procurements and shall in all 
instances disclose information regarding the protest to the awarding 
agency. A protestor must exhaust all administrative remedies with the 
grantee and subgrantee before pursuing a protest with the Federal 
agency. Reviews of protests by the Federal agency will be limited to:
    (i) Violations of Federal law or regulations and the standards of 
this section (violations of State or local law will be under the 
jurisdiction of State or local authorities) and
    (ii) Violations of the grantee's or subgrantee's protest procedures 
for failure to review a complaint or protest. Protests received by the 
Federal agency other than those specified above will be referred to the 
grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Competition. (1) All procurement transactions will be conducted 
in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with the 
standards of Sec. 602.36. Some of the situations considered to be 
restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:
    (i) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to 
qualify to do business,
    (ii) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding,
    (iii) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between 
affiliated companies,
    (iv) Noncompetitive awards to consultants that are on retainer 
contracts,
    (v) Organizational conflicts of interest,
    (vi) Specifying only a ``brand name'' product instead of allowing 
``an equal'' product to be offered and describing the performance of 
other relevant requirements of the procurement, and
    (vii) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will conduct procurements in a manner 
that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-
State or local geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or 
proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes 
expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing in this 
section preempts State licensing laws. When contracting for 
architectural and engineering (A/E) services, geographic location may be 
a selection criteria provided its application leaves an appropriate 
number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to 
compete for the contract.
    (3) Grantees will have written selection procedures for procurement 
transactions. These procedures will ensure that all solicitations:
    (i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical 
requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such 
description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features 
which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a 
statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service 
to be procured, and when necessary, shall set forth those minimum 
essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it 
is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should 
be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to 
make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a 
``brand name or equal'' description may be used as a means to define the 
performance or other salient requirements of a procurement. The specific 
features of the named brand which must be met by offerors shall be 
clearly stated; and
    (ii) Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and 
all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.
    (4) Grantees and subgrantees will ensure that all prequalified lists 
of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and 
services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure 
maximum open and free competition. Also, grantees and subgrantees will 
not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation 
period.
    (d) Methods of procurement to be followed--(1) Procurement by small 
purchase procedures. Small purchase procedures

[[Page 61]]

are those relatively simple and informal procurement methods for 
securing services, supplies, or other property that do not cost more 
than the simplified acquisition threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) 
(currently set at $100,000). If small purchase procedures are used, 
price or rate quotations shall be obtained from an adequate number of 
qualified sources.
    (2) Procurement by sealed bids (formal advertising). Bids are 
publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit 
price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with 
all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the 
lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for 
procuring construction, if the conditions in Sec. 602.36(d)(2)(i) apply.
    (i) In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following 
conditions should be present:
    (A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase 
description is available;
    (B) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete 
effectively and for the business; and
    (C) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and 
the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the 
basis of price.
    (ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:
    (A) The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids 
shall be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing 
them sufficient time prior to the date set for opening the bids;
    (B) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications 
and pertinent attachments, shall define the items or services in order 
for the bidder to properly respond;
    (C) All bids will be publicly opened at the time and place 
prescribed in the invitation for bids;
    (D) A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing to the 
lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding 
documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life 
cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is lowest. 
Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior 
experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; 
and
    (E) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented 
reason.
    (3) Procurement by competitive proposals. The technique of 
competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source 
submitting an offer, and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type 
contract is awarded. It is generally used when conditions are not 
appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the 
following requirements apply:
    (i) Requests for proposals will be publicized and identify all 
evaluation factors and their relative importance. Any response to 
publicized requests for proposals shall be honored to the maximum extent 
practical;
    (ii) Proposals will be solicited from an adequate number of 
qualified sources;
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees will have a method for conducting 
technical evaluations of the proposals received and for selecting 
awardees;
    (iv) Awards will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is 
most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors 
considered; and
    (v) Grantees and subgrantees may use competitive proposal procedures 
for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) 
professional services whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated 
and the most qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of 
fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as 
a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional 
services. It cannot be used to purchase other types of services though 
A/E firms are a potential source to perform the proposed effort.
    (4) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals is procurement through 
solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or after solicitation 
of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.
    (i) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used only when 
the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase procedures, 
sealed bids

[[Page 62]]

or competitive proposals and one of the following circumstances applies:
    (A) The item is available only from a single source;
    (B) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not 
permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation;
    (C) The awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive proposals; or
    (D) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is 
determined inadequate.
    (ii) Cost analysis, i.e., verifying the proposed cost data, the 
projections of the data, and the evaluation of the specific elements of 
costs and profits, is required.
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees may be required to submit the 
proposed procurement to the awarding agency for pre-award review in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (e) Contracting with small and minority firms, women's business 
enterprise and labor surplus area firms. (1) The grantee and subgrantee 
will take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority firms, 
women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when 
possible.
    (2) Affirmative steps shall include:
    (i) Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women's 
business enterprises on solicitation lists;
    (ii) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women's 
business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources;
    (iii) Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into 
smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small and 
minority business, and women's business enterprises;
    (iv) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, 
which encourage participation by small and minority business, and 
women's business enterprises;
    (v) Using the services and assistance of the Small Business 
Administration, and the Minority Business Development Agency of the 
Department of Commerce; and
    (vi) Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, 
to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through 
(v) of this section.
    (f) Contract cost and price. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must 
perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement 
action including contract modifications. The method and degree of 
analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular 
procurement situation, but as a starting point, grantees must make 
independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. A cost 
analysis must be performed when the offeror is required to submit the 
elements of his estimated cost, e.g., under professional, consulting, 
and architectural engineering services contracts. A cost analysis will 
be necessary when adequate price competition is lacking, and for sole 
source procurements, including contract modifications or change orders, 
unless price reasonableness can be established on the basis of a catalog 
or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities 
to the general public or based on prices set by law or regulation. A 
price analysis will be used in all other instances to determine the 
reasonableness of the proposed contract price.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will negotiate profit as a separate 
element of the price for each contract in which there is no price 
competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To 
establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration will be given to 
the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the 
contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, 
the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates 
in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.
    (3) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under 
grants will be allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost 
estimates included in negotiated prices are consistent with Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 602.22). Grantees may reference their own cost 
principles that comply with the applicable Federal cost principles.
    (4) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of 
construction cost methods of contracting shall not be used.

[[Page 63]]

    (g) Awarding agency review. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must make 
available, upon request of the awarding agency, technical specifications 
on proposed procurements where the awarding agency believes such review 
is needed to ensure that the item and/or service specified is the one 
being proposed for purchase. This review generally will take place prior 
to the time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation 
document. However, if the grantee or subgrantee desires to have the 
review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the 
awarding agency may still review the specifications, with such review 
usually limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees must on request make available for 
awarding agency pre-award review procurement documents, such as requests 
for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc. 
when:
    (i) A grantee's or subgrantee's procurement procedures or operation 
fails to comply with the procurement standards in this section; or
    (ii) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold and is to be awarded without competition or only 
one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation; or
    (iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product; or
    (iv) The proposed award is more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold and is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder 
under a sealed bid procurement; or
    (v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract 
or increases the contract amount by more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold.
    (3) A grantee or subgrantee will be exempt from the pre-award review 
in paragraph (g)(2) of this section if the awarding agency determines 
that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this section.
    (i) A grantee or subgrantee may request that its procurement system 
be reviewed by the awarding agency to determine whether its system meets 
these standards in order for its system to be certified. Generally, 
these reviews shall occur where there is a continuous high-dollar 
funding, and third-party contracts are awarded on a regular basis.
    (ii) A grantee or subgrantee may self-certify its procurement 
system. Such self-certification shall not limit the awarding agency's 
right to survey the system. Under a self-certification procedure, 
awarding agencies may wish to rely on written assurances from the 
grantee or subgrantee that it is complying with these standards. A 
grantee or subgrantee will cite specific procedures, regulations, 
standards, etc., as being in compliance with these requirements and have 
its system available for review.
    (h) Bonding requirements. For construction or facility improvement 
contracts or subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition 
threshold, the awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and 
requirements of the grantee or subgrantee provided the awarding agency 
has made a determination that the awarding agency's interest is 
adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the 
minimum requirements shall be as follows:
    (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of 
the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist of a firm commitment 
such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument 
accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of 
his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within 
the time specified.
    (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent 
of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is one executed in 
connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's 
obligations under such contract.
    (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of 
the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed in connection 
with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons 
supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for 
in the contract.

[[Page 64]]

    (i) Contract provisions. A grantee's and subgrantee's contracts must 
contain provisions in paragraph (i) of this section. Federal agencies 
are permitted to require changes, remedies, changed conditions, access 
and records retention, suspension of work, and other clauses approved by 
the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.
    (1) Administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances 
where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such 
sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate. (Contracts more than the 
simplified acquisition threshold)

(Construction contracts in excess of $2000 awarded by grantees and 
subgrantees when required by Federal grant program legislation)
    (6) Compliance with Sections 103 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours 
and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-330) as supplemented by 
Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). (Construction contracts 
awarded by grantees and subgrantees in excess of $2000, and in excess of 
$2500 for other contracts which involve the employment of mechanics or 
laborers)
    (7) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining to reporting.
    (8) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining to patent rights with respect to any discovery or invention 
which arises or is developed in the course of or under such contract.

duly authorized representatives to any books, documents, papers, and 
records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to that specific 
contract for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and 
transcriptions.
    (11) Retention of all required records for three years after 
grantees or subgrantees make final payments and all other pending 
matters are closed.
    (12) Compliance with all applicable standards, orders, or 
requirements issued under section 306 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C.

Sec. 602.37  Subgrants.

    (a) States. States shall follow state law and procedures when 
awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or 
fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal 
governments. States shall:
    (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by 
Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations;
    (2) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon 
them by Federal statute and regulation;

[[Page 65]]

    (3) Ensure that a provision for compliance with Sec. 602.42 is 
placed in every cost reimbursement subgrant; and
    (4) Conform any advances of grant funds to subgrantees substantially 
to the same standards of timing and amount that apply to cash advances 
by Federal agencies.
    (b) All other grantees. All other grantees shall follow the 
provisions of this part which are applicable to awarding agencies when 
awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or 
fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal 
governments. Grantees shall:
    (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes a provision for compliance 
with this part;
    (2) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by 
Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations; 
and
    (3) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon 
them by Federal statutes and regulations.
    (c) Exceptions. By their own terms, certain provisions of this part 
do not apply to the award and administration of subgrants:
    (1) Section 602.10;
    (2) Section 602.11;

              Reports, Records, Retention, and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 602.40  Monitoring and reporting program performance.

    (a) Monitoring by grantees. Grantees are responsible for managing 
the day-to-day operations of grant and subgrant supported activities. 
Grantees must monitor grant and subgrant supported activities to assure 
compliance with applicable Federal requirements and that performance 
goals are being achieved. Grantee monitoring must cover each program, 
function or activity.
    (b) Nonconstruction performance reports. The Federal agency may, if 
it decides that performance information available from subsequent 
applications contains sufficient information to meet its programmatic 
needs, require the grantee to submit a performance report only upon 
expiration or termination of grant support. Unless waived by the Federal 
agency this report will be due on the same date as the final Financial 
Status Report.
    (1) Grantees shall submit annual performance reports unless the 
awarding agency requires quarterly or semi-annual reports. However, 
performance reports will not be required more frequently than quarterly. 
Annual reports shall be due 90 days after the grant year, quarterly or 
semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The 
final performance report will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support. If a justified request is submitted by a 
grantee, the Federal agency may extend the due date for any performance 
report. Additionally, requirements for unnecessary performance reports 
may be waived by the Federal agency.
    (2) Performance reports will contain, for each grant, brief 
information on the following:
    (i) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives 
established for the period. Where the output of the project can be 
quantified, a computation of the cost per unit of output may be required 
if that information will be useful.
    (ii) The reasons for slippage if established objectives were not 
met.
    (iii) Additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, 
analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
    (3) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of performance reports.
    (4) Grantees will adhere to the standards in this section in 
prescribing performance reporting requirements for subgrantees.
    (c) Construction performance reports. For the most part, on-site 
technical inspections and certified percentage-of-completion data are 
relied on heavily by Federal agencies to monitor progress under 
construction grants and subgrants. The Federal agency will require 
additional formal performance reports only when considered necessary, 
and never more frequently than quarterly.

[[Page 66]]

    (d) Significant developments. Events may occur between the scheduled 
performance reporting dates which have significant impact upon the grant 
or subgrant supported activity. In such cases, the grantee must inform 
the Federal agency as soon as the following types of conditions become 
known:
    (1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially 
impair the ability to meet the objective of the award. This disclosure 
must include a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any 
assistance needed to resolve the situation.
    (2) Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and 
objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more 
beneficial results than originally planned.
    (e) Federal agencies may make site visits as warranted by program 
needs.
    (f) Waivers, extensions. (1) Federal agencies may waive any 
performance report required by this part if not needed.
    (2) The grantee may waive any performance report from a subgrantee 
when not needed. The grantee may extend the due date for any performance 
report from a subgrantee if the grantee will still be able to meet its 
performance reporting obligations to the Federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 602.41  Financial reporting.

    (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) (2) and (5) of 
this section, grantees will use only the forms specified in paragraphs 
(a) through (e) of this section, and such supplementary or other forms 
as may from time to time be authorized by OMB, for:
    (i) Submitting financial reports to Federal agencies, or
    (ii) Requesting advances or reimbursements when letters of credit 
are not used.
    (2) Grantees need not apply the forms prescribed in this section in 
dealing with their subgrantees. However, grantees shall not impose more 
burdensome requirements on subgrantees.
    (3) Grantees shall follow all applicable standard and supplemental 
Federal agency instructions approved by OMB to the extend required under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 for use in connection with forms 
specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. Federal 
agencies may issue substantive supplementary instructions only with the 
approval of OMB. Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the grantee 
to disregard any line item that the Federal agency finds unnecessary for 
its decisionmaking purposes.
    (4) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of forms required under this part.
    (5) Federal agencies may provide computer outputs to grantees to 
expedite or contribute to the accuracy of reporting. Federal agencies 
may accept the required information from grantees in machine usable 
format or computer printouts instead of prescribed forms.
    (6) Federal agencies may waive any report required by this section 
if not needed.
    (7) Federal agencies may extend the due date of any financial report 
upon receiving a justified request from a grantee.
    (b) Financial Status Report--(1) Form. Grantees will use Standard 
Form 269 or 269A, Financial Status Report, to report the status of funds 
for all nonconstruction grants and for construction grants when required 
in accordance with paragraph Sec. 602.41(e)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (2) Accounting basis. Each grantee will report program outlays and 
program income on a cash or accrual basis as prescribed by the awarding 
agency. If the Federal agency requires accrual information and the 
grantee's accounting records are not normally kept on the accural basis, 
the grantee shall not be required to convert its accounting system but 
shall develop such accrual information through and analysis of the 
documentation on hand.
    (3) Frequency. The Federal agency may prescribe the frequency of the 
report for each project or program. However, the report will not be 
required more frequently than quarterly. If the Federal agency does not 
specify the frequency of the report, it will be submitted annually. A 
final report will be required upon expiration or termination of grant 
support.
    (4) Due date. When reports are required on a quarterly or semiannual

[[Page 67]]

basis, they will be due 30 days after the reporting period. When 
required on an annual basis, they will be due 90 days after the grant 
year. Final reports will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support.
    (c) Federal Cash Transactions Report--(1) Form. (i) For grants paid 
by letter or credit, Treasury check advances or electronic transfer of 
funds, the grantee will submit the Standard Form 272, Federal Cash 
Transactions Report, and when necessary, its continuation sheet, 
Standard Form 272a, unless the terms of the award exempt the grantee 
from this requirement.
    (ii) These reports will be used by the Federal agency to monitor 
cash advanced to grantees and to obtain disbursement or outlay 
information for each grant from grantees. The format of the report may 
be adapted as appropriate when reporting is to be accomplished with the 
assistance of automatic data processing equipment provided that the 
information to be submitted is not changed in substance.
    (2) Forecasts of Federal cash requirements. Forecasts of Federal 
cash requirements may be required in the ``Remarks'' section of the 
report.
    (3) Cash in hands of subgrantees. When considered necessary and 
feasible by the Federal agency, grantees may be required to report the 
amount of cash advances in excess of three days' needs in the hands of 
their subgrantees or contractors and to provide short narrative 
explanations of actions taken by the grantee to reduce the excess 
balances.
    (4) Frequency and due date. Grantees must submit the report no later 
than 15 working days following the end of each quarter. However, where 
an advance either by letter of credit or electronic transfer of funds is 
authorized at an annualized rate of one million dollars or more, the 
Federal agency may require the report to be submitted within 15 working 
days following the end of each month.
    (d) Request for advance or reimbursement--(1) Advance payments. 
Requests for Treasury check advance payments will be submitted on 
Standard Form 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. (This form will 
not be used for drawdowns under a letter of credit, electronic funds 
transfer or when Treasury check advance payments are made to the grantee 
automatically on a predetermined basis.)
    (2) Reimbursements. Requests for reimbursement under nonconstruction 
grants will also be submitted on Standard Form 270. (For reimbursement 
requests under construction grants, see paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section.)
    (3) The frequency for submitting payment requests is treated in 
Sec. 602.41(b)(3).
    (e) Outlay report and request for reimbursement for construction 
programs. (1) Grants that support construction activities paid by 
reimbursement method.
    (i) Requests for reimbursement under construction grants will be 
submitted on Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Federal agencies may, however, 
prescribe the Request for Advance or Reimbursement form, specified in 
Sec. 602.41(d), instead of this form.
    (ii) The frequency for submitting reimbursement requests is treated 
in Sec. 602.41(b)(3).
    (2) Grants that support construction activities paid by letter of 
credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advance.
    (i) When a construction grant is paid by letter of credit, 
electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advances, the grantee will 
report its outlays to the Federal agency using Standard Form 271, Outlay 
Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The 
Federal agency will provide any necessary special instruction. However, 
frequency and due date shall be governed by Sec. 602.41(b) (3) and (4).
    (ii) When a construction grant is paid by Treasury check advances 
based on periodic requests from the grantee, the advances will be 
requested on the form specified in Sec. 602.41(d).
    (iii) The Federal agency may substitute the Financial Status Report 
specified in Sec. 602.41(b) for the Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs.

[[Page 68]]

    (3) Accounting basis. The accounting basis for the Outlay Report and 
Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs shall be governed by 
Sec. 602.41(b)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 602.42  Retention and access requirements for records.

    (a) Applicability. (1) This section applies to all financial and 
programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and 
other records of grantees or subgrantees which are:
    (i) Required to be maintained by the terms of this part, program 
regulations or the grant agreement, or
    (ii) Otherwise reasonably considered as pertinent to program 
regulations or the grant agreement.
    (2) This section does not apply to records maintained by contractors 
or subcontractors. For a requirement to place a provision concerning 
records in certain kinds of contracts, see Sec. 602.36(i)(10).
    (b) Length of retention period. (1) Except as otherwise provided, 
records must be retained for three years from the starting date 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action 
involving the records has been started before the expiration of the 3-
year period, the records must be retained until completion of the action 
and resolution of all issues which arise from it, or until the end of 
the regular 3-year period, whichever is later.
    (3) To avoid duplicate recordkeeping, awarding agencies may make 
special arrangements with grantees and subgrantees to retain any records 
which are continuously needed for joint use. The awarding agency will 
request transfer of records to its custody when it determines that the 
records possess long-term retention value. When the records are 
transferred to or maintained by the Federal agency, the 3-year retention 
requirement is not applicable to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Starting date of retention period--(1) General. When grant 
support is continued or renewed at annual or other intervals, the 
retention period for the records of each funding period starts on the 
day the grantee or subgrantee submits to the awarding agency its single 
or last expenditure report for that period. However, if grant support is 
continued or renewed quarterly, the retention period for each year's 
records starts on the day the grantee submits its expenditure report for 
the last quarter of the Federal fiscal year. In all other cases, the 
retention period starts on the day the grantee submits its final 
expenditure report. If an expenditure report has been waived, the 
retention period starts on the day the report would have been due.
    (2) Real property and equipment records. The retention period for 
real property and equipment records starts from the date of the 
disposition or replacement or transfer at the direction of the awarding 
agency.
    (3) Records for income transactions after grant or subgrant support. 
In some cases grantees must report income after the period of grant 
support. Where there is such a requirement, the retention period for the 
records pertaining to the earning of the income starts from the end of 
the grantee's fiscal year in which the income is earned.
    (4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. This 
paragraph applies to the following types of documents, and their 
supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost 
allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at 
which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage 
chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).
    (i) If submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or other 
computation is required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to 
the grantee) to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-
year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of 
such submission.
    (ii) If not submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or 
other computation is not required to be submitted to the Federal 
Government (or to the grantee) for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year 
retention period for the proposal plan, or computation and its 
supporting records starts from end of the fiscal year (or other 
accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.

[[Page 69]]

    (d) Substitution of microfilm. Copies made by microfilming, 
photocopying, or similar methods may be substituted for the original 
records.
    (e) Access to records--(1) Records of grantees and subgrantees. The 
awarding agency and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any 
of their authorized representatives, shall have the right of access to 
any pertinent books, documents, papers, or other records of grantees and 
subgrantees which are pertinent to the grant, in order to make audits, 
examinations, excerpts, and transcripts.
    (2) Expiration of right of access. The rights of access in this 
section must not be limited to the required retention period but shall 
last as long as the records are retained.
    (f) Restrictions on public access. The Federal Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) does not apply to records Unless required 
by Federal, State, or local law, grantees and subgrantees are not 
required to permit public access to their records.


<R05>
Sec. 602.43  Enforcement.

    (a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a grantee or subgrantee 
materially fails to comply with any term of an award, whether stated in 
a Federal statute or regulation, an assurance, in a State plan or 
application, a notice of award, or elsewhere, the awarding agency may 
take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the 
circumstances:
    (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the 
deficiency by the grantee or subgrantee or more severe enforcement 
action by the awarding agency,
    (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and matching credit 
for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in 
compliance,
    (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award for the 
grantee's or subgrantee's program,
    (4) Withhold further awards for the program, or
    (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.
    (b) Hearings, appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the awarding 
agency will provide the grantee or subgrantee an opportunity for such 
hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the grantee 
or subgrantee is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to 
the action involved.
    (c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of grantee or 
subgrantee resulting from obligations incurred by the grantee or 
subgrantee during a suspension or after termination of an award are not 
allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the 
notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other grantee or 
subgrantee costs during suspension or after termination which are 
necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if:
    (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred 
by the grantee or subgrantee before the effective date of suspension or 
termination, are not in anticipation of it, and, in the case of a 
termination, are noncancellable, and,
    (2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or 
expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the 
termination takes effect.
    (d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement 
remedies identified in this section, including suspension and 
termination, do not preclude grantee or subgrantee from being subject to 
``Debarment and Suspension'' under E.O. 12549 (see Sec. 602.35).


<R05>
Sec. 602.44  Termination for convenience.

    Except as provided in Sec. 602.43 awards may be terminated in whole 
or in part only as follows:
    (a) By the awarding agency with the consent of the grantee or 
subgrantee in which case the two parties shall agree upon the 
termination conditions, including the effective date and in the case of 
partial termination, the portion to be terminated, or
    (b) By the grantee or subgrantee upon written notification to the 
awarding agency, setting forth the reasons for such termination, the 
effective date, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to 
be terminated. However, if, in the case of a partial termination, the 
awarding agency determines that the remaining portion of the award will 
not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made,

[[Page 70]]

the awarding agency may terminate the award in its entirety under either 
Sec. 602.43 or paragraph (a) of this section.


<R04>
                 Subpart D--After-the-Grant Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 602.50  Closeout.

    (a) General. The Federal agency will close out the award when it 
determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required 
work of the grant has been completed.
    (b) Reports. Within 90 days after the expiration or termination of

    (c) Cost adjustment. The Federal agency will, within 90 days after 
receipt of reports in paragraph (b) of this section, make upward or 
downward adjustments to the allowable costs.

<R05>

<R04>
                 Subpart B--Activities by Own Employees


<R05>
Sec. 604.200  Agency and legislative liaison.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in 
Sec. 604.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable 
compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if 
the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not 
directly related to a covered Federal action.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any 
information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable 
at any time.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following 
agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only 
where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered 
Federal action:
    (1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) 
the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, 
conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,
    (2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the 
application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an 
agency's use.
    (d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following 
agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where 
they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:
    (1) Providing any information not specifically requested but 
necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of 
a covered Federal action;
    (2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an 
unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,
    (3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an 
agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended 
by Public Law 95-507 and other subsequent amendments.
    (e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 604.205  Professional and technical services.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in 
Sec. 604.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable 
compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or 
an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a 
Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is 
for professional or technical services rendered directly in the 
preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or 
application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative 
agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a 
condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or 
cooperative agreement.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, ``professional 
and technical services'' shall be limited to advice and analysis 
directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, 
drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer 
is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the 
performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered 
directly in the negotiation of a

[[Page 75]]

contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to 
influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a 
technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under 
this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying 
their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or 
analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission 
or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, 
communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not 
provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the 
legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate 
one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because 
the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, 
communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer 
providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission 
of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the 
engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the 
preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.
    (c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for 
receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or 
regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, 
and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
    (d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 604.210  Reporting.

    No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable 
compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a 
person.


<R04>
            Subpart C--Activities by Other Than Own Employees


<R05>
Sec. 604.300  Professional and technical services.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in 
Sec. 604.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment 
to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional 
or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, 
or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal 
contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting 
requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving 
that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.
    (b) The reporting requirements in Sec. 604.110 (a) and (b) regarding 
filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply 
with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in 
the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing 
for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, ``professional 
and technical services'' shall be limited to advice and analysis 
directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, 
drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer 
is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the 
performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered 
directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, 
communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such 
as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed 
accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide 
advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical 
expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and 
solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered 
Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to 
influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis 
directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's 
proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not 
allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing 
professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent 
to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior 
to the preparation or submission of a bid

[[Page 76]]

or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is 
providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, 
submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.
    (d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for 
receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or 
regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, 
and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
    (e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting 
or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade 
associations.
    (f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.


<R04>
                  Subpart D--Penalties and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 604.400  Penalties.

    (a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be 
subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than 
$100,000 for each such expenditure.
    (b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see 
Appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject 
to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 
for each such failure.
    (c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an 
administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced 
does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure 
occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with 
respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in 
writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.
    (d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount 
of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency 
shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the 
violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in 
business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability 
of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such 
other matters as may be appropriate.
    (e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section 
shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating 
circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be 
subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as 
determined by the agency head or his or her designee.
    (f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not 
prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply 
to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil 
penalty.


<R05>
Sec. 604.405  Penalty procedures.

    Agencies shall impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the 
provisions of the Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. 
sections 3803 (except subsection (c)), 3804, 3805, 3806, 3807, 3808, and 
3812, insofar as these provisions are not inconsistent with the 
requirements herein.


<R05>
Sec. 604.410  Enforcement.

    The head of each agency shall take such actions as are necessary to 
ensure that the provisions herein are vigorously implemented and 
enforced in that agency.


<R04>
                          Subpart E--Exemptions


<R05>
Sec. 604.500  Secretary of Defense.

    (a) The Secretary of Defense may exempt, on a case-by-case basis, a 
covered Federal action from the prohibition whenever the Secretary 
determines, in writing, that such an exemption is in the national 
interest. The Secretary shall transmit a copy of each such written 
exemption to Congress immediately after making such a determination.
    (b) The Department of Defense may issue supplemental regulations to 
implement paragraph (a) of this section.

    (c) Information that involves intelligence matters shall be reported 
only to the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, the

    The regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services on 
Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Handicap, 45 CFR part 84, including 
any amendments thereto, have been adopted almost in their entirety to 
programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance from the 
National Science Foundation. The few changes in the Foundation's rules 
include a newly added sub-paragraph (5) to paragraph (k) of Sec. 605.3; 
and modifications in paragraph (j), Sec. 605.3; paragraph (a) of 
Sec. 605.5; paragraph (b) of Sec. 605.46; and Sec. 605.61. Paragraph (c) 
of Sec. 605.5 has been removed, and ``qualified handicapped persons'' 
has been substituted for ``handicapped persons'' wherever that phrase 
appears in Sec. 605.4(b)(5) and in Subpart C (Secs. 605.21 through 
605.23). The date for compliance with Sec. 605.33(d) has been changed.

qualifications for participation. Physical qualifications are not 
``reasonable,'' however, if they can be obviated without unreasonable 
burden by modifying facilities or programs or by providing auxiliary 
aids. In determining whether the burdens are unreasonable, factors such 
as cost, risks, or sacrifice of legitimate program objectives may be 
considered. In exceptional cases psychological qualifications may be 
considered `reasonable physical qualifications' under this paragraph. 
Nothing in this provision or these regulations requires reversal of 
scientific judgments on research, including choice of experiments, 
protocols for experiments, location of observing sites, or the like that 
are considered necessary to any line of scientific inquiry by the 
research scientists involved.
    (l) Handicap means any condition or characteristic that renders a 
person a handicapped person as defined in paragraph (j) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 605.4  Discrimination prohibited.

handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, 
or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or 
activity which receives or benefits from Federal financial assistance.
    (b) Discriminatory actions prohibited. (1) A recipient, in providing 
any aid, benefit, or service, may not, directly or through contractual, 
licensing, or other arrangements, on the basis of handicap:
    (i) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;
    (ii) Afford a qualified handicapped person an opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not 
equal to that afforded others;
    (iii) Provide a qualified handicapped person with an aid, benefit, 
or service that is not as effective as that provided to others;
    (iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to 
handicapped persons or to any class of handicapped persons unless such 
action is necessary to provide qualified handicapped persons with aid, 
benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;
    (v) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified handicapped 
person by providing significant assistance to an agency, organization, 
or person that discriminates on the basis of handicap in providing any 
aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of the recipients program;
    (vi) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to 
participate as a member of planning or advisory boards; or
    (vii) Otherwise limit a qualified handicapped person in the 
enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by 
others receiving an aid, benefit, or service.
    (2) For purposes of this part, aids, benefits, and services, to be 
equally effective, are not required to produce the identical result or 
level of achievement for handicapped and nonhandicapped persons, but 
must afford handicapped

[[Page 85]]

persons equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same 
benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement, in the most 
integrated setting appropriate to the person's needs.
    (3) Despite the existence of separate or different programs or 
activities provided in accordance with this part, a recipient may not 
deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate in 
such programs or activities that are not separate or different.
    (4) A recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other 
arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration (i) that 
have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to 
discrimination on the basis of handicap, (ii) that have the purpose or 
effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the 
objectives of the recipient's program with respect to handicapped 
persons, or (iii) that perpetuate the discrimination of another 
recipient if both recipients are subject to common administrative 
control or are agencies of the same State.
    (5) In determining the site or location of a facility, an applicant 
for assistance or a recipient may not make selections (i) that have the 
effect of excluding qualified handicapped persons from, denying them the 
benefits of, or otherwise subjecting them to discrimination under any 
program or activity that receives or benefits from Federal financial 
assistance or (ii) that have the purpose or effect of defeating or 
substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the 
program or activity with respect to qualified handicapped persons.
    (6) As used in this section, the aid, benefit, or service provided 
under a program or activity receiving or benefiting from Federal 
financial assistance includes any aid, benefit, or service provided in 
or through a facility that has been constructed, expanded, altered, 
leased or rented, or otherwise acquired, in whole or in part, with 
Federal financial assistance.
    (c) Programs limited by Federal law. The exclusion of nonhandicapped 
persons from the benefits of a program limited by Federal statute or 
executive order to handicapped persons or the exclusion of a specific 
class of handicapped persons from a program limited by Federal statute 
or executive order to a different class of handicapped persons is not 
prohibited by this part.


<R05>
Sec. 605.5  Assurances required.

the period during which the real property or structures are used for the 
purpose for which Federal financial assistance is extended or for 
another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.
    (2) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide 
personal property, the assurance will obligate the recipient for the 
period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property.
    (3) In all other cases the assurance will obligate the recipient for 
the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.


<R05>
Sec. 605.6  Remedial action, voluntary action, and self-evaluation.

    (a) Remedial action. (1) If the Director finds that a recipient has 
discriminated against persons on the basis of handicap in violation of 
section 504 or this part, the recipient shall take such remedial action 
as the Director deems necessary to overcome the effects of the 
discrimination.
    (2) Where a recipient is found to have discriminated against persons 
on the basis of handicap in violation of section 504 or this part and 
where another recipient exercises control over the recipient that has 
discriminated, the Director, where appropriate, may require either or 
both recipients to take remedial action.
    (3) The Director may, where necessary to overcome the effects of 
discrimination in violation of section 504 or this part, require a 
recipient to take

[[Page 86]]

remedial action (i) with respect to handicapped persons who are no 
longer participants in the recipient's program but who were participants 
in the program when such discrimination occurred or (ii) with respect to 
handicapped persons who would have been participants in the program had 
the discrimination not occurred.
    (b) Voluntary action. A recipient may take steps, in addition to any 
action that is required by this part, to overcome the effects of 
conditions that resulted in limited participation in the recipient's 
program or activity by qualified handicapped persons.
    (c) Self-evaluation. (1) A recipient shall, within one year of the 
effective date of this part:
    (i) Evaluate, with the assistance of interested persons, including 
handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, 
its current policies and practices and the effects thereof that do not 
or may not meet the requirements of this part;
    (ii) Modify, after consultation with interested persons, including 
handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, 
any policies and practices that do not meet the requirements of this 
part; and
    (iii) Take, after consultation with interested persons, including 
handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, 
appropriate remedial steps to eliminate the effects of any 
discrimination that resulted from adherence to these policies and 
practices.
    (2) A recipient that employs fifteen or more persons shall, for at 
least three years following completion of the evaluation required under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, maintain on file, make available for 
public inspection, and provide to the Director upon request: (i) A list 
of the interested person consulted (ii) a description of areas examined 
and any problems identified, and (iii) a description of any 
modifications made and any remedial steps taken.


<R05>
Sec. 605.7  Designation of responsible employee and adoption of grievance procedures.

    (a) Designation of responsible employee. A recipient that employs 
fifteen or more persons shall designate at least one person to 
coordinate its efforts to comply with this part.
    (b) Adoption of grievance procedures. A recipient that employs 
fifteen or more persons shall adopt grievance procedures that 
incorporate appropriate due process standards and that provide for the 
prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action 
prohibited by this part. Such procedures need not be established with 
respect to complaints from applicants for employment or from applicants 
for admission to postsecondary educational institutions.


<R05>
Sec. 605.8  Notice.

    (a) A recipient that employs fifteen or more persons shall take 
appropriate initial and continuing steps to notify participants, 
beneficiaries, applications, and employees, including those with 
impaired vision or hearing, and unions or professional organizations 
holding collective bargaining or professional agreements with the 
recipient that it does not discriminate on the basis of handicap in 
violation of section 504 and this part. The notification shall state, 
where appropriate, that the recipient does not discriminate in admission 
or access to, or treatment or employment in, its programs and 
activities. The notification shall also include an identification of the 
responsible employee designated pursuant to Sec. 605.7(a). A recipient 
shall make the initial notification required by this paragraph within 90 
days of the effective date of this part. Methods of initial and 
continuing notification may include the posting of notices, publication 
in newspapers and magazines, placement of notices in recipient's 
publication, and distribution of memoranda or other written 
communications.
    (b) If a recipient publishes or uses recruitment materials or 
publications containing general information that it makes available to 
participants, beneficiaries, applicants, or employees, it shall include 
in those materials or publications a statement of the policy described 
in paragraph (a) of this section. A recipient may meet the requirement 
of this paragraph either by including appropriate inserts in existing 
materials and publications or by revising

[[Page 87]]

and reprinting the materials and publications.


<R05>
Sec. 605.9  Administrative requirements for small recipients.

    The Director may require any recipient with fewer than fifteen 
employees, or any class of such recipients, to comply with Secs. 605.7 
and 605.8, in whole or in part, when the Director finds a violation of 
this part or finds that such compliance will not significantly impair 
the ability of the recipient or class or recipients to provide benefits 
or services.


<R05>
Sec. 605.10  Effect of state or local law or other requirements and effect of employment opportunities.

    (a) The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or 
alleviated by the existence of any state or local law or other 
requirement that, on the basis of handicap, imposes prohibitions or 
limits upon the eligibility of qualified handicapped persons to receive 
services or to practice any occupation or profession.
    (b) The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or 
alleviated because employment opportunities in any occupation or 
profession are or may be more limited for handicapped persons than for 
nonhandicapped persons.


<R04>

handicap.
    (4) A recipient may not participate in a contractual or other 
relationship that has the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped 
applicants or employees to discrimination prohibited by this subpart. 
The relationships referred to in this subparagraph include relationships

<R05>
Sec. 605.12  Reasonable accommodation.

    (a) A recipient shall make reasonable accommodation to the known 
physical or mental limitations of an otherwise

[[Page 88]]

qualified handicapped applicant or employee unless the recipient can 
demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the 
operation of its program.
    (b) Reasonable accommodation may include: (1) Making facilities used 
by employees readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons, 
and (2) job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules,

recipient's program, factors to be considered include:
    (1) The overall size of the recipient's program with respect to 
number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget;
    (2) The type of the recipient's operation, including the composition 
and structure of the recipient's workforce; and
    (3) The nature and cost of the accommodation needed.
    (d) A recipient may not deny any employment opportunity to a 
qualified handicapped employee or applicant if the basis for the denial 
is the need to make reasonable accommodation to the physical or mental 
limitations of the employee or applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 605.13  Employment criteria.

    (a) A recipient may not make use of any employment test or other 
selection criterion that screens out or tends to screen out handicapped 
persons or any class of handicapped persons unless: (1) The test score 
or other selection criterion, as used by the recipient, is shown to be 
job-related for the position in question, and (2) alternative job-
related tests or criteria that do not screen out or tend to screen out 
as many handicapped persons are not shown by the Director to be 
available.
    (b) A recipient shall select and administer tests concerning 
employment so as best to ensure that, when administered to an applicant 
or employee who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking 
skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's or 
employee's job skills, aptitude, or whatever other factor the test 
purports to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant's or 
employee's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where 
those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).


<R05>
Sec. 605.14  Preemployment inquiries.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a 
recipient may not conduct a preemployment medical examination or may not 
make preemployment inquiry of an applicant as to whether the applicant 
is a handicapped person or as to the nature or severity of a handicap. A 
recipient may, however, make preemployment inquiry into an applicant's 
ability to perform job-related functions.
    (b) When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the 
effects of past discrimination pursuant to Sec. 605.6(a), when a 
recipient is taking voluntary action to overcome the effects of 
conditions that resulted in limited participation in its federally 
assisted program or activity pursuant to Sec. 605.6(b), or when a 
recipient is taking affirmative action pursuant to section 503 of the 
Act, the recipient may invite applicants for employment to indicate 
whether and to what extent they are handicapped, Provided, That:
    (1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used 
for this purpose or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is 
used that the information requested is intended for use solely in 
connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary or 
affirmative action efforts; and
    (2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being 
requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential as 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section, that refusal to provide it 
will not subject the applicant or employee to any adverse treatment, and 
that it will be used only in accordance with this part.
    (c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from 
conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical 
examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty,

[[Page 89]]

Provided, That: (1) All entering employees are subjected to such an 
examination regardless of handicap, and (2) the results of such an 
examination are used only in accordance with the requirements of this 
part.
    (d) Information obtained in accordance with this section as to the 
medical condition or history of the applicant shall be collected and 
maintained on separate forms that shall be accorded confidentiality as 
medical records, except that:
    (1) Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding restrictions 
on the work or duties of handicapped persons and regarding necessary 
accommodations;
    (2) First aid and safety personnel may be informed, where 
appropriate, if the condition might require emergency treatment; and
    (3) Government officials investigating compliance with the Act shall 
be provided relevant information upon request.

                    Subpart C--Program Accessibility


<R05>
Sec. 605.21  Discrimination prohibited.

    No qualified handicapped person shall, because a recipient's 
facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be 
denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise 
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity to which 
this part applies.


<R05>
Sec. 605.22  Existing facilities.

    (a) Program accessibility. A recipient shall operate each program or 
activity to which this part applies so that the program or activity, 
when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to qualified 
handicapped persons. This paragraph does not require a recipient to make 
each of its existing facilities or every part of a facility accessible 
to and usable by qualified handicapped persons.
    (b) Methods. A recipient may comply with the requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible 
buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery 
of health, welfare, or other social services at alternate accessible 
sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new 
facilities in conformance with the requirements of Sec. 605.23, or any 
other methods that result in making its program or activity accessible 
to qualified handicapped persons. A recipient is not required to make 
structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are 
effective in achieving compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. In 
choosing among available methods for meeting the requirement of 
paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall give priority to those 
methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped 
persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (c) Small health, welfare, or other social service providers. If a 
recipient with fewer than fifteen employees that provides health, 
welfare, or other social services finds, after consultation with a 
qualified handicapped person seeking its services, that there is no 
method of complying with paragraph (a) of this section other than making 
a significant alteration in its existing facilities, the recipient may, 
as an alternative, refer the qualified handicapped person to other 
providers of those services that are accessible.
    (d) Time period. A recipient shall comply with the requirement of 
paragraph (a) of this section within sixty days of the effective date of 
this part except that where structural changes in facilities are 
necessary, such changes shall be made within three years of the 
effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (e) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities are necessary to meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of 
this section, a recipient shall develop, within six months of the 
effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps 
necessary to complete such changes. The plan shall be developed with the 
assistance of interested persons, including qualified handicapped 
persons or organizations representing qualified handicapped persons. A 
copy of the transition plan shall be made available for

[[Page 90]]

public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum:
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its program or activity to qualified 
handicapped persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
full program accessibility and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify the steps of that will be taken 
during each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the person responsible for implementation of the plan.
    (f) Notice. The recipient shall adopt and implement procedures to 
ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision 
or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of 
services, activities, and facilities that are accessible to and usuable 
by qualified handicapped persons.


<R05>
Sec. 605.23  New construction.

    (a) Design and construction. Each facility or part of a facility 
constructed by, on behalf of, or for the use of a recipient shall be 
designed and constructed in such manner that the facility or part of the 
facility is readily accessible to and usable by qualified handicapped 
persons, if the construction was commenced after the effective date of 
this part.
    (b) Alteration. Each facility or part of a facility which is altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of a recipient after the effective date 
of this part in a manner that affects or could affect the usability of 
the facility or part of the facility shall, to the maximum extent 
feasible, be altered in such manner that the altered portion of the 
facility is readily accessible to and usable by qualified handicapped 
persons.
    (c) Conformance with Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards. (1) 
Effective as of January 18, 1991, design, construction, or alteration of 
buildings in conformance with sections 3-8 of the Uniform Federal 
Accessibility Standards (USAF) (appendix A to 41 CFR subpart 101-19.6) 
shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with 
respect to those buildings. Departures from particular technical and 
scoping requirements of UFAS by the use of other methods are permitted 
where substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of the 
building is provided.
    (2) For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall 
be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical 
rooms and other spaces that, because of their intended use, will not 
require accessibility to the public or beneficiaries or result in the 
employment or residence therein of persons with physical handicaps.
    (3) This section does not require recipients to make building 
alterations that have little likelihood of being accomplished without 
removing or altering a load-bearing structural member.

        Subpart D--Preschool, Elementary, and Secondary Education


<R05>
Sec. 605.31  Application of this subpart.

    Subpart D applies to preschool, elementary, secondary, and adult 
education programs and activities that receive or benefit from Federal 
financial assistance and to recipients that operate, or that receive or 
benefit from Federal financial assistance for the operation of, such 
programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec. 605.32  Location and notification.

    A recipient that operates a public elementary or secondary education 
program shall annually:
    (a) Undertake to identify and locate every qualified handicapped 
person residing in the recipient's jurisdiction who is not receiving a 
public education; and
    (b) Take appropriate steps to notify handicapped persons and their 
parents or guardians or the recipient's duty under this subpart.

[[Page 91]]


<R05>
Sec. 605.33  Free appropriate public education.

    (a) General. A recipient that operates a public elementary or 
secondary education program shall provide a free appropriate public 
education to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient's 
jurisdiction, regardless of the nature or severity of the person's 
handicap.
    (b) Appropriate education. (1) For the purpose of this subpart, the 
provision of an appropriate education is the provision of regular or 
special education and related aids and services that (i) are designed to 
meet individual educational needs of handicapped persons as adequately 
as the needs of nonhandicapped persons are met and (ii) are based upon 
adherence to procedures that satisfy the requirements of Secs. 605.34, 
605.35 and 605.36.
    (2) Implementation of an individualized education program developed 
in accordance with the Education of the Handicapped Act is one means of 
meeting the standard established in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
    (3) A recipient may place a handicapped person in or refer such 
person to a program other than the one that it operates as its means of 
carrying out the requirements of this subpart. If so, the recipient 
remains responsible for ensuring that the requirements of this subpart 
are met with respect to any handicapped person so placed or referred.
    (c) Free education--(1) General. For the purpose of this section, 
the provision of a free education is the provision of educational and 
related services without cost to the handicapped person or to his or her 
parents or guardian, except for those fees that are imposed on non-
handicapped persons or their parents or guardian. It may consist either 
of the provision of free services or, if a recipient places a 
handicapped person in or refers such person to a program not operated by 
the recipient as its means of carrying out the requirements of this 
subpart, of payment for the costs of the program. Funds available from 
any public or private agency may be used to meet the requirements of 
this subpart. Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve an 
insurer or similar third party from an otherwise valid obligation to 
provide or pay for services provided to a handicapped person.
    (2) Transportation. If a recipient places a handicapped person in or 
refers such person to a program not operated by the recipient as its 
means of carrying out the requirements of this subpart, the recipient 
shall ensure that adequate transportation to and from the program is 
provided at no greater cost than would be incurred by the person or his 
or her parents or guardian if the person were placed in the program 
operated by the recipient.
    (3) Residential placement. If placement in a public or private 
residential program is necessary to provide a free appropriate public 
education to a handicapped person because of his or her handicap, the 
program, including non-medical care and room and board, shall be 
provided at no cost to the person or his or her parents or guardian.
    (4) Placement of handicapped persons by parents. If a recipient has 
made available, in conformance with the requirements of this section and 
Sec. 605.34, a free appropriate public education to a handicapped person 
and the person's parents or guardian chooses to place the person in a 
private school, the recipient is not required to pay for the person's 
education in the private school. Disagreements between a parent or 
guardian and a recipient regarding whether the recipient has made such a 
program available or otherwise regarding the question of financial 
responsibility are subject to the due process procedures of Sec. 605.36.
    (d) Compliance. A recipient may not exclude any qualified 
handicapped person from a public elementary or secondary education after 
the effective date of this part. A recipient that is not, on the 
effective date of this regulation, in full compliance with the other 
requirements of the preceding paragraphs of this section shall meet such 
requirements at the earliest practicable time and in no event later than 
July 1, 1983.


<R05>
Sec. 605.34  Educational setting.

    (a) Academic setting. A recipient to which this subpart applies 
shall educate, or shall provide for the education of, each qualified 
handicapped person

[[Page 92]]

in its jurisdiction with persons who are not handicapped to the maximum 
extent appropriate to the needs of the handicapped person. A recipient 
shall place a handicapped person in the regular educational environment 
operated by the recipient unless it is demonstrated by the recipient 
that the education of the person in the regular environment with the use 
of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily. 
Whenever a recipient places a person in a setting other than the regular 
educational environment pursuant to this paragraph, it shall take into 
account the proximity of the alternate setting to the person's home.
    (b) Nonacademic settings. In providing or arranging for the 
provision of nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities, 
including meals, recess periods, and the services and activities set 
forth in Sec. 605.37(a)(2), a recipient shall ensure that handicapped 
persons participate with nonhandicapped persons in such activities and 
services to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the 
handicapped person in question.
    (c) Comparable facilities. If a recipient, in compliance with 
paragraph (a) of this section, operates a facility that is identifiable 
as being for handicapped persons, the recipient shall ensure that the 
facility and the services and activities provided therein are comparable 
to the other facilities, services, and activities of the recipient.


<R05>
Sec. 605.35  Evaluation and placement.

    (a) Preplacement evaluation. A recipient that operates a public 
elementary or secondary education program shall conduct an evaluation in 
accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section of any 
person who, because of handicap, needs or is believed to need special 
education or related services before taking any action with respect to 
the initial placement of the person in a regular or special education 
program and any subsequent significant change in placement.
    (b) Evaluation procedures. A recipient to which this subpart applies 
shall establish standards and procedures for the evaluation and 
placement of persons who, because of handicap, need or are believed to 
need special education or related services which ensure that:
    (1) Tests and other evaluation materials have been validated for the 
specific purpose for which they are used and are administered by trained 
personnel in conformance with the instructions provided by their 
producer;
    (2) Tests and other evaluation materials include those tailored to 
assess specific areas of educational need and not merely those which are 
designed to provide a single general intelligence quotient; and
    (3) Tests are selected and administered so as best to ensure that, 
when a test is administered to a student with impaired sensory, manual, 
or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the student's 
aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factor the test purports 
to measure, rather than reflecting the student's impaired sensory, 
manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors 
that the test purports to measure).
    (c) Placement procedures. In interpreting evaluation data and in 
making placement decisions, a recipient shall (1) draw upon information 
from a variety of sources, including aptitude and achievement tests, 
teacher recommendations, physical condition, social or cultural 
background, and adaptive behavior, (2) establish procedures to ensure 
that information obtained from all such sources is documented and 
carefully considered, (3) ensure that the placement decision is made by 
a group of persons, including persons knowledgeable about the child, the 
meaning of the evaluation data, and the placement options, and (4) 
ensure that the placement decision is made in conformity with 
Sec. 605.34.
    (d) Reevaluation. A recipient to which this section applies shall 
establish procedures, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, 
for periodic reevaluation of students who have been provided special 
education and related services. A reevaluation procedure consistent with 
the Education for the Handicapped Act is one means of meeting this 
requirement.

[[Page 93]]


<R05>
Sec. 605.36  Procedural safeguards.

    A recipient that operates a public elementary or secondary education 
program shall establish and implement, with respect to actions regarding 
the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of persons who, 
because of handicap, need or are believed to need special instruction or 
related services, a system of procedural safeguards that includes 
notice, an opportunity for the parents or guardian of the person to 
examine relevant records, an impartial hearing with opportunity for 
participation by the person's parents or guardian and representation by 
counsel, and a review procedure. Compliance with the procedural 
safeguards of section 615 of the Education of the Handicapped Act is one 
means of meeting this requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 605.37  Nonacademic services.

    (a) General. (1) A recipient to which this subpart applies shall 
provide nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities in such 
manner as is necessary to afford handicapped students an equal 
opportunity for participation in such services and activities.
    (2) Nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities may 
include counseling services, physical recreational athletics, 
transportation, health services, recreational activities, special 
interest groups or clubs sponsored by the recipients, referrals to 
agencies which provide assistance to handicapped persons, and employment 
of students, including both employment by the recipient and assistance 
in making available outside employment.
    (b) Counseling services. A recipient to which this subpart applies 
that provides personal, academic, or vocational counseling, guidance, or 
placement services to its students shall provide these services without 
discrimination on the basis of handicap. The recipient shall ensure that 
qualified handicapped students are not counseled toward more restrictive 
career objectives than are nonhandicapped students with similar 
interests and abilities.
    (c) Physical education and athletics. (1) In providing physical 
education courses and athletics and similar programs and activities to 
any of its students, a recipient to which this subpart applies may not 
discriminate on the basis of handicap. A recipient that offers physical 
education courses or that operates or sponsors interscholastic, club, or 
intramural athletics shall provide to qualified handicapped students an 
equal opportunity for participation in these activities.
    (2) A recipient may offer to handicapped students physical education 
and athletic activities that are separate or different from those 
offered to nonhandicapped students only if separation or differentiation 
is consistent with the requirements of Sec. 605.34 and only if no 
qualified handicapped student is denied the opportunity to compete for 
teams or to participate in courses that are not separate or different.


<R05>
Sec. 605.38  Preschool and adult education programs.

    A recipient to which this subpart applies that operates a preschool 
education or day care program or activity or an adult education program 
or activity may not, on the basis of handicap, exclude qualified 
handicapped persons from the program or activity and shall take into 
account the needs of such persons in determining the aid, benefits, or 
services to be provided under the program or activity.


<R05>
Sec. 605.39  Private education programs.

    (a) A recipient that operates a private elementary or secondary 
education program may not, on the basis of handicap, exclude a qualified 
handicapped person from such program if the person can, with minor 
adjustments, be provided an appropriate education, as defined in 
Sec. 605.33(b)(1), within the recipient's program.
    (b) A recipient to which this section applies may not charge more 
for the provision of an appropriate education to handicapped persons 
than to nonhandicapped persons except to the extent that any additional 
charge is justified by a substantial increase in cost to the recipient.
    (c) A recipient to which this section applies that operates special 
education programs shall operate such programs in accordance with the 
provisions of Secs. 605.35 and 605.36. Each recipient to which this 
section applies is subject to

[[Page 94]]

the provisions of Secs. 605.34, 605.37 and 605.38.

<R05>
Sec. 605.41  Application of this subpart.

    Subpart E applies to postsecondary education programs and 
activities, including postsecondary vocational education programs and 
activities, that receive or benefit from Federal financial assistance 
and to recipients that operate, or that receive or benefit from Federal 
financial assistance for the operation of, such programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec. 605.42  Admissions and recruitment.

    (a) General. Qualified handicapped persons may not, on the basis of 
handicap, be denied admission or be subjected to discrimination in 
admission or recruitment by a recipient to which this subpart applies.
    (b) Admissions. In administering its admission policies, a recipient 
to which this subpart applies:
    (1) May not apply limitations upon the number or proportion of 
handicapped persons who may be admitted;
    (2) May not make use of any test or criterion for admission that has 
a disproportionate, adverse effect on handicapped persons or any class 
of handicapped persons unless (i) the test or criterion, as used by the 
recipient, has been validated as a predictor of success in the education 
program or activity in question and (ii) alternate tests or criteria 
that have a less disproportionate, adverse effect are not shown by the 
Director to be available.
    (3) Shall assure itself that (i) admissions tests are selected and 
administered so as best to ensure that, when a test is administered to 
an applicant who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or 
speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's 
aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factor the test purports 
to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant's impaired sensory, 
manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors 
that the test purports to measure); (ii) admissions tests that are 
designed for persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills 
are offered as often and in as timely a manner as are other admissions 
tests; and (iii) admissions tests are administered in facilities that, 
on the whole, are accessible to handicapped persons; and
    (4) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, may not 
make preadmission inquiry as to whether an applicant for admission is a 
handicapped person but, after admission, may make inquiries on a 
confidential basis as to handicaps that may require accommodation.
    (c) Preadmission inquiry exception. When a recipient is taking 
remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination pursuant 
to Sec. 605.6(a) or when a recipient is taking voluntary action to 
overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited 
participation in its federally assisted program or activity pursuant to 
Sec. 605.6(6), the recipient may invite applicants for admission to 
indicate whether and to what extent they are handicapped, Provided, 
That:
    (1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used 
for this purpose or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is 
used that the information requested is intended for use solely in 
connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary action 
efforts; and
    (2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being 
requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential, that 
refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant to any adverse 
treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this part.
    (d) Validity studies. For the purpose of paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, a recipient may base prediction equations on first year grades, 
but shall conduct periodic validity studies against the criterion of 
overall success in the education program or activity in question in 
order to monitor the general validity of the test scores.


<R05>
Sec. 605.43  Treatment of students; general.

    (a) No qualified handicapped student shall, on the basis of 
handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied

[[Page 95]]

the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any 
academic, research, occupational training, housing, health insurance, 
counseling, financial aid, physical education, athletics, recreation, 
transportation, other extracurricular, or other postsecondary education 
program or activity to which this subpart applies.
    (b) A recipient to which this subpart applies that considers 
participation by students in education programs or activities not 
operated wholly by the recipient as part of, or equivalent to, an 
education program or activity operated by the recipient shall assure 
itself that the other education program or activity, as a whole, 
provides an equal opportunity for the participation of qualified 
handicapped persons.
    (c) A recipient to which this subpart applies may not, on the basis 
of handicap, exclude any qualified handicapped student from any course, 
course of study, or other part of its education program or activity.
    (d) A recipient to which this subpart applies shall operate its 
programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 605.44  Academic adjustments.

    (a) Academic requirements. A recipient to which this subpart applies 
shall make such modifications to its academic requirements as are 
necessary to ensure that such requirements do not discriminate or have 
the effect of discriminating, on the basis of handicap, against a 
qualified handicapped applicant or student. Academic requirements that 
the recipient can demonstrate are essential to the program of 
instruction being pursued by such student or to any directly related 
licensing requirement will not be regarded as discriminatory within the 
meaning of this section. Modifications may include changes in the length 
of time permitted for the completion of degree requirements, 
substitution of specific courses required for the completion of degree 
requirements, and adaptation of the manner in which specific courses are 
conducted.
    (b) Other rules. A recipient to which this subpart applies may not 
impose upon handicapped students other rules, such as the prohibition of 
tape recorders in classrooms or of dog guides in campus buildings, that 
have the effect of limiting the participation of handicapped students in 
the recipient's education program or activity.
    (c) Course examinations. In its course examinations or other 
procedures for evaluating students' academic achievement in its program, 
a recipient to which this subpart applies shall provide such methods for 
evaluating the achievement of students who have a handicap that impairs 
sensory, manual, or speaking skills as will best ensure that the results 
of the evaluation represents the student's achievement in the course, 
rather than reflecting the student's impaired sensory, manual, or 
speaking skills (except where such skills are the factors that the test 
purports to measure).
    (d) Auxiliary aids. (1) A recipient to which this subpart applies 
shall take such steps as are necessary to ensure that no handicapped 
student is denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or 
otherwise subjected to discrimination under the education program or 
activity operated by the recipient because of the absence of educational 
auxiliary aids for students with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking 
skills.
    (2) Auxiliary aids may include taped texts, interpreters or other 
effective methods of making orally delivered materials available to 
students with hearing impairments, readers in libraries for students 
with visual impairments, classroom equipment adapted for use by students 
with manual impairments, and other similar services and actions. 
Recipients need not provide attendents, individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices or services of a 
personal nature.


<R05>
Sec. 605.45  Housing.

    (a) Housing provided by the recipient. A recipient that provides 
housing to its nonhandicapped students shall provide comparable, 
convenient, and accessible housing to handicapped students at the same 
cost as to others. At the end of the transition period provided for in 
subpart C, such housing shall be available in sufficient quantity and 
variety

[[Page 96]]

so that the scope of handicapped students' choice of living

subpart applies may not (i), on the basis of handicap, provide less 
assistance than is provided to nonhandicapped persons, limit eligibility 
for assistance, or otherwise discriminate or (ii) assist any entity or 
person that provides assistance to any of the recipient's students in a

forms of financial assistance is not discriminatory on the basis of 
handicap.
    (b) Assistance in making available outside employment. A recipient 
that helps its students to obtain employment shall assure itself that 
the employment opportunities it helps to make available to students are,

subpart applies that provides personal, academic, or vocational 
counseling, guidance, or placement services to its students shall 
provide these services without discrimination on the basis of handicap. 
The recipient shall ensure that qualified handicapped students are not 
counseled toward more restrictive career objectives than are 
nonhandicapped students with similar interests and abilities. This 
requirement does not preclude a recipient from providing factual 
information about licensing and certification requirements that may 
present obstacles to handicapped persons in their pursuit of particular 
careers.
    (c) Social organizations. A recipient that provides significant 
assistance to fraternities, sororities, or similar organizations shall 
assure itself that the membership practices of such organizations do not 
permit discrimination otherwise prohibited by this subpart.

and procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29

<R05>
Sec. 606.50  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 606.51, no qualified individual 
with handicaps shall, because the Foundation's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the Foundation.


<R05>
Sec. 606.51  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The Foundation shall operate each program or activity 
so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the Foundation to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps; or
    (2) Require the Foundation to take any action that it can 
demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a 
program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In 
those circumstances where Foundation personnel believe that the proposed 
action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result 
in undue financial and administrative burdens, the Foundation has the 
initial burden of establishing that compliance with Sec. 606.51(a) would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Foundation 
Director or his or her designee after considering all Foundation 
resources available for use in the funding and operation of the 
conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written 
statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action 
would result in such an alteration or burdens, the Foundation shall take 
any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such 
burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps 
receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
    (b) Methods. The Foundation may comply with the requirements of this 
section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of 
services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, 
home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, 
alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, 
use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in 
making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The Foundation is not required to make 
structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are 
effective in achieving compliance with this section. The Foundation, in 
making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility 
requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations 
implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the 
requirements of this section, the Foundation shall give priority to 
those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The Foundation shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section within 60 days of the 
effective date of this part except that where structural

[[Page 102]]

changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made within 
three years of the effective date of this part, but in any event as 
expeditiously as possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
Foundation shall develop, within six months of the effective date of 
this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to 
complete such changes. The Foundation shall provide an opportunity to 
interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or 
organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in 
the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral 
and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for 
public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the Foundation's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of transition plan 
is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each 
year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 606.52  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the Foundation shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.

Sec. 606.60  Communications.

    (a) The Foundation shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The Foundation shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the Foundation.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
Foundation shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The Foundation need not provide individually prescribed 
devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a 
personal nature.
    (2) Where the Foundation communicates with applicants and 
beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunications devices for deaf persons 
(TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to 
communicate with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The Foundation shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The Foundation shall provide signage at a primary entrance to 
each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at 
which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the Foundation to take any action 
that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where Foundation personnel believe that 
the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative

[[Page 103]]

burdens, the Foundation has the initial burden of establishing that 
compliance with Sec. 606.60 would result in such alteration or burdens. 
The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens 
must be made by the Foundation Director or his or her designee after 
considering all Foundation resources available for use in the funding 
and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would 
result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Foundation shall take 
any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such 
burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent 
possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services 
of the program or activity.

Foundation and submitted within 180 days of the alleged acts of 
discrimination or in the case of complaints not within the jurisdiction 
of the Foundation, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall 
make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate 
government entity. Complete complaints submitted after the 180 day time 
limit may also be acted upon at the discretion of the Foundation if good 
cause for the delay in submission is found.

    (a) Request for hearing. (1) An employee may file a petition for an 
oral or paper hearing in accordance with the instructions outlined in 
the agency's notice to offset.
    (2) A hearing may be requested by filing a written petition

<R05>
Sec. 607.7  Coordinating offset with another Federal agency.

    (a) When the NSF is the creditor agency and the Chief Financial 
Officer determines that an employee of another agency (i.e., the paying 
agency) owes a debt to the NSF, the Chief Financial Officer shall, as 
appropriate:
    (1) Certify in writing to the paying agency that the employee owes 
the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date on which payment 
was due, and the date the Government's right to collect the debt 
accrued, and that this part 607 has been approved by the Office of 
Personnel Management.
    (2) Unless the employee has consented to salary offset in writing or 
signed a statement acknowledging receipt of the required procedures, and 
the written consent is sent to the paying agency, the Chief Financial 
Officer must advise the paying agency of the action(s) taken under this 
part 607, and the date(s) they were taken.
    (3) Request the paying agency to collect the debt by salary offset. 
If deductions must be made in installments, the Chief Financial Officer 
may recommend to the paying agency the amount or percentage of 
disposable pay to be collected in each installment;
    (4) Arrange for a hearing upon the proper petitioning by the 
employee.
    (b) When the NSF is the creditor agency and the employee is in the 
process of separating from the Federal service, the NSF must submit its 
debt claim to the paying agency as provided in this part. The paying 
agency must certify the total amount collected, give a copy of the 
certification to the employee, and send a copy of the certification and 
notice of the employee's separation to the NSF. If the paying agency is 
aware that the employee is entitled to Civil Service Retirement and 
Disability Fund or other similar payments, it must certify to the agency 
responsible for making such payments that the debtor owes a debt, 
including the amount of the debt, and that the provisions of 5 CFR 
550.1108 have been followed.
    (c) When the NSF is the creditor agency and the employee has already

[[Page 107]]

separated from Federal service and all payments due from the paying 
agency have been paid, the Chief Financial Officer may request, unless 
otherwise prohibited, that money payable to the employee from the Civil 
Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar funds be 
collected by administrative offset.
    (d) When the NSF is the paying agency, upon receipt of a properly 
certified debt claim from another agency, deductions will be scheduled 
to begin at the next established pay interval. The employee must receive 
written notice that NSF has received a certified debt claim from the 
creditor agency, the amount of the debt, the date salary offset will 
begin, and the amount of the deduction(s). NSF shall not review the 
merits of the creditor agency's determination of the validity or the 
amount of the certified claim. If the employee transfers to another 
agency after the creditor agency has submitted its debt claim to NSF and 
before the debt is collected completely, NSF must certify the amount 
collected. One copy of the certification must be furnished to the 
employee. A copy must be furnished to the creditor agency with notice of 
the employee's transfer.


<R05>
Sec. 607.8  Procedures for salary offset.

    (a) Deductions to liquidate an employee's debt will be by the method 
and in the amount stated in the Chief Financial Officer's notice of 
intention to offset as provided in Sec. 607.4. Debts will be collected 
in one lump sum where possible. If the employee is financially unable to 
pay in one lump sum, collection must be made in installments.
    (b) Debts will be collected by deduction at officially established 
pay intervals from an employee's current pay account unless alternative 
arrangements for repayment are made.
    (c) Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater 
than the anticipated period of employment. The size of installment 
deductions must bear a reasonable relationship to the size of the debt 
and the employee's ability to pay. The deduction for the pay intervals 
for any period must not exceed 15% of disposable pay unless the employee 
has agreed in writing to a deduction of a greater amount.
    (d) Unliquidated debts may be offset against any financial payment 
due to a separated employee including but not limited to final salary or 
leave payment in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716.


<R05>
Sec. 607.9  Refunds.

    (a) NSF will promptly refund to an employee any amounts deducted to 
satisfy debts owed to NSF when the debt is waived, found not owed to 
NSF, or when directed by an administrative or judicial order.
    (b) Another creditor agency will promptly return to NSF any amounts 
deducted by NSF to satisfy debts owed to the creditor agency when the 
debt is waived, found not owed, or when directed by an administrative or 
judicial order.
    (c) Unless required by law, refunds under this section shall not 
bear interest.


<R05>
Sec. 607.10  Statute of limitations.

    If a debt has been outstanding for more than 10 years after NSF's 
right to collect the debt first accrued, the agency may not collect by 
salary offset unless facts material to the Government's right to collect 
were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the official 
or officials who were charged with the responsibility for discovery and 
collection of such debts.


<R05>
Sec. 607.11  Non-waiver of rights.

    An employee's involuntary payment of all or any part of a debt 
collected under the regulations in this part will not be construed as a 
waiver of any rights that the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or 
any other provision of law.


<R05>
Sec. 607.12  Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.

    Charges may be assessed on a debt for interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717 and the Federal 
Claims Collection Standards, 4 CFR 101.1.

    Source:  58 FR 68772, Dec. 29, 1993, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 608.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This part sets forth policies and procedures for the collection 
and compromise claims and the administrative offset of claims by the 
National Science Foundation (NSF) pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711, 3716, 3718 
and 3720A. It is not intended to limit or govern the rights of the NSF 
or the United States to collect, compromise, or administratively offset 
debts or claims under other authority and procedures that may be legally 
available to it.

    (b) Matters not addressed in this part should be reviewed and 
handled in accordance with applicable statutory provisions and the 
Federal Claims Collection Standards issued jointly by the Attorney 
General and the Comptroller General (4 CFR parts 101 through 105).

    (c) Any action other than the issuance of regulations specifically 
required to be done by the head of the agency by any of the statutes or 
regulations referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall 
be done on behalf of NSF by its Chief Financial Officer or by those to 
whom the Chief Financial Officer delegates authority. This is not 
intended to prevent the Chief Financial Officer from issuing additional 
internal procedures and guidance consistent with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 608.2  Collection, compromise, and use of consumer reporting agencies.

    (a) Subject to the specific limitations and procedures of 31 U.S.C. 
3711 and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Federal 
Claims Collection Standards, NSF, acting through its Chief Financial 
Officer or those to whom he or she delegates authority or assigns 
responsibilities, shall try to collect claims of the United States 
Government for money or property arising out of the activities of NSF or 
that are referred to NSF and may compromise or suspend or end collection 
action of certain claims. In making demands for payment, NSF will follow 
the guidance set forth at 4 CFR 102.2. In appropriate cases, as 
authorized by and subject to 31 U.S.C. 3718 and 4 CFR 102.6, NSF may 
contract for collection services. Before compromising or suspending or 
ending the collection of a claim in excess of $5,000, the matter shall 
be referred to the NSF Office of General Counsel for legal review.

    (b) When trying to collect a claim of the Government (except for 
claims under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), 
NSF may disclose to a consumer reporting agency information from a 
system of records that an individual is responsible for a claim if (1) a 
notice published pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(3)(4) indicates that 
information in the system of records may be disclosed to a consumer 
reporting agency that an individual is responsible for a claim and (2) 
if the Chief Financial Officer of NSF decides that the claim is valid 
and overdue. Such disclosures to a consumer reporting agency will be 
done only under the conditions and procedures specified in 31 U.S.C. 
3711(f) and in the Federal Claims Collections Standards. Specifically, 
before NSF provides the information to the consumer reporting agency, 
the individual will be given the notice required by 31 U.S.C. 
3711(f)(1)(C); and in accordance with 4 CFR 102.5(c), the right of 
administrative review to be provided to the individual shall be 
consistent with the provisions of 4 CFR 102.3(c). If NSF does not have a 
current address for the individual in its files, it will take reasonable 
action to locate the individual, but if unsuccessful will mail the 
notice to the individual's last known address. NSF will disclose 
information only to a consumer reporting agency that gives satisfactory 
assurances that it is complying with all laws of the United States 
relating to providing consumer credit information. The information 
provided by NSF shall be limited to the type of information described in 
31 U.S.C. 3711(f)(1)(F). Moreover, NSF will not provide such information 
until it has established internal procedures to disclose promptly to a 
consumer reporting agency to which disclosure is made of any substantial 
changes in the condition or amount of the claim and to verify or correct 
promptly information about the claim on request of a

[[Page 109]]

consumer reporting agency for verification of information disclosed.
    (c) If in response to the notice referred to in paragraph (b) of 
this section, the individual repays or agrees in writing with NSF to a 
repayment plan, the information will not be disclosed to a consumer 
reporting agency. If in response to the notice referred to in paragraph 
(b) the individual requests a review or reconsideration of the claim, 
information shall not be disclosed to the consumer reporting agency 
until such a review is provided.
    (d) The review referred to in paragraph (c) of this section shall be 
based only on the written documentation in the file, including any 
additional written information provided by the individual in response to 
the notice referred to in paragraph (b). A written summary briefly 
describing the nature of the review performed and the conclusion reached 
shall be made. The written summary and conclusion shall be referred to 
the NSF Office of General Counsel for legal review. After legal review, 
a copy of the written summary shall be sent to the individual.


<R05>
Sec. 608.3  Administrative offset.

    (a) If NSF is unable to collect a claim from a person after trying 
to do so in accordance with Sec. 608.2, NSF may collect the claim by 
administrative offset subject to the procedures and limitations of 31 
U.S.C. 3716 and the applicable provisions of the Federal Claims 
Collection Standards. Determinations to pursue administrative offset 
shall be made on a case-by-case basis taking into account the 
considerations specified at 31 U.S.C. 3716(b) and 4 CFR 102.3(a). Before 
employing administrative offset, NSF will comply with the notice, 
hearing, review, or other procedural requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) 
and 4 CFR 102.3(b) and (c). Furthermore, before an administrative offset 
is taken by NSF pursuant to the authority of this part 608, the matter 
shall be referred to the Office of General Counsel for legal review to 
ensure that the required procedures have been followed.
    (b) When another agency requests NSF to administratively offset a 
claim owing to that agency, NSF will normally comply with such request 
if the requesting agency has provided the certification required by 4 
CFR 102.3(f) and offset would not be contrary to law. Before imposing 
administrative offsets at the request of another agency under this part 
608, the matter shall be referred to the NSF Office of General Counsel 
for legal review.
    (c)(1) In appropriate cases, NSF may request another agency to 
administratively setoff a claim owed to NSF. Before making the 
certification to the other agency required by 4 CFR 102.3(f), the matter 
shall be referred to the NSF Office of General Counsel for legal review.
    (2) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, NSF may request that moneys 
that are due and payable to a debtor from the Civil Service Retirement 
and Disability Fund, the Foreign Service Retirement Fund or any other 
Federal retirement fund be administratively offset in reasonable amounts 
in order to collect in one full payment or a minimal number of payments 
debts owed the United States by the debtor. Such requests shall be made 
to the appropriate officials of the respective fund servicing agency in 
accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by that agency. 
The requests for administrative offset will certify in writing that (i) 
the debtor owes the United States a debt and the amount of the debt; 
(ii) NSF has complied with applicable regulations and procedures; and 
(iii) NSF has followed the requirements of the Federal Claims Collection 
Standards as made applicable by this section. Once NSF decides to 
request offset from a Federal retirement fund, it will make the request 
as soon as practical after completion of the applicable procedures in 
order that the fund servicing agency may identify and flag the debtor's 
account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests or becomes 
eligible to receive payments from the fund and to ensure that offset 
will be initiated prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations.
    (3) If NSF collects part or all of the debt by other means before 
deductions are made or completed pursuant to this paragraph (c), NSF 
shall act promptly to modify or terminate its request for offset.

[[Page 110]]

    (4) This paragraph (c) does not require or authorize the fund 
servicing agency to review the merits of (i) NSF's determination with 
respect to the amount and validity of the debt, (ii) NSF's determination 
as to waiver under an applicable statute, or (iii) NSF's determination 
to provide or not provide an oral hearing.
    (d) No collection by administrative offset shall be made on any debt 
that has been outstanding for more than ten years unless facts material 
to the Government's right to collect the debt were not known, and 
reasonably could not have been known, by the official or officials 
responsible for discovering the debt.
    (e) Administrative offset under this section will not be initiated 
against:
    (1) A debt in which administrative offset of the type of debt 
involved is explicitly provided for or prohibited by a statutes other 
than 31 U.S.C. 3716, including debts subject to the Salary offset 
procedures at 45 CFR part 607;
    (2) Debts owed by other agencies of the United States or by any 
State or local Government; or
    (3) Debts arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954; the 
Social Security Act; or the tariff laws of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 608.4  Reductions of tax refunds.

    (a) In accordance with regulations and guidance issued by the 
Secretary of the Treasury at 26 CFR 301.6402-6 and the requirements of 
31 U.S.C. 3720A, NSF will participate in the Federal Tax Refund Offset 
Program for offset against income tax refunds of persons owing past due 
legally enforceable debts to NSF.
    (b) For purposes of this section, a past-due legally enforceable 
debt referable to the IRS is a debt which is owed to the United States 
and:
    (1) Except in the case of a judgment debt, has been delinquent for 
at least three months but has not been delinquent for more than ten 
years at the time the offset is made;
    (2) Cannot be currently collected pursuant to the salary offset 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1);
    (3) Is ineligible for administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) 
by reason of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2) or cannot be collected by 
administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by NSF against amounts 
payable to or on behalf of the debtor by or on behalf of NSF;
    (4) With respect to which NSF has notified or has made a reasonable 
attempt to notify the taxpayer that the debt is past-due and, unless 
repaid within 60 days thereafter, the debt will be referred to the IRS 
for offset against any overpayment of tax;
    (5) With respect to which NSF has given the taxpayer at least 60 
days from the date of notification to present evidence that all or part 
of the debt is not past-due or legally enforceable, has considered the 
evidence presented by such taxpayer, and has determined that an amount 
of such debt is past-due and legally enforceable;
    (6) Has been disclosed by NSF to a consumer reporting agency as 
authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3711(f), unless a consumer reporting agency 
would be prohibited from using such information by 15 U.S.C. 1681c, or 
unless the amount of the debt does not exceed $100.00;
    (7) Is at least $25.00;
    (8) All other requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A and the Internal 
Revenue Service regulations at 26 CFR 301.6402-6 relating to the 
eligibility of a debt for tax return offset have been satisfied.
    (c) NSF will make a request for reduction of an IRS tax refund only 
after the NSF determines that an amount is owed and past-due and 
provides the debtor with 60 days written notice. NSF's notice of 
intention to collect by IRS tax refund offset (Notice of Intent) will 
state:
    (1) The amount of the debt;
    (2) That unless the debt is repaid within 60 days from the date of 
the NSF's Notice of Intent, NSF intends to collect the debt by 
requesting the IRS to reduce any amounts payable to the debtor as 
refunds of Federal taxes paid by an amount equal to the amount of the 
debt and all accumulated interest and other charges;
    (3) That the debtor has a right to present evidence that all or part 
of the debt is not past-due or legally enforceable; and
    (4) A mailing address for forwarding any written correspondence and 
a contact name and phone number for any questions.

[[Page 111]]

    (d) A debtor who receives a Notice of Intent has the right to 
present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not 
legally enforceable. To exercise this right, the debtor must:
    (1) Send a written request for a review of the evidence to the 
address provided in the notice.
    (2) State in the request the amount disputed and the reasons why the 
debtor believes that the debt is not past-due or is not legally 
enforceable.
    (3) Include with the request any documents which the debtor wishes 
to be considered or state that additional information will be submitted 
within the remainder of the 60-day period.
    (e) The failure of a debtor to respond as provided in paragraph (d) 
of this section will result in an automatic referral of the debt to the 
IRS without further action by NSF. If the debtor responds, NSF will 
consider all available evidence related to the debt and issue a written 
determination, including supporting rationale, whether its prior 
determination that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable is 
sustained, amended, or canceled. Before this determination is made the 
matter shall be referred to the NSF Office of General Counsel for legal 
review. NSF will give prompt notification of this determination to the 
debtor.

    Authority:  Sec. 11(a), National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as 
amended, 42 U.S.C. 1870(a); 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1.

    Source:  29 FR 16305, Dec. 4, 1964, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 611.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to effectuate the provisions of title VI 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (hereafter referred to as the ``Act'') 
to the end that no person in the United States shall, on the grounds of 
race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be 
denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination 
under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance 
from the National Science Foundation.


<R05>
Sec. 611.2  Application of part.

    This part applies to any program for which Federal financial 
assistance is authorized under a law administered by the Foundation, 
including the Federally-assisted programs and activities listed in 
Appendix A of this part. It applies to money paid, property transferred, 
or other Federal financial assistance extended under any such program 
after the effective date of the regulation pursuant to an application 
approved prior to such effective date. This part does not apply to (a) 
any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty 
contract, (b) money paid, property transferred, or other assistance 
extended under any such program before the effective date of this part, 
(c) any assistance to any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary 
under any such program, or (d) any employment practice, under any such 
program, of any employer, employment agency, or labor organization, 
except to the extent described in Sec. 611.3. The fact that a program or 
activity is not listed in the Appendix shall not mean, if title VI of 
the Act is otherwise applicable, that such program is not covered. Other 
programs under statutes now in force or hereafter enacted may be added 
to this list by notice published in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 611.3  Discrimination prohibited.

    (a) General. No person in the United States, shall, on grounds of 
race, color,

[[Page 112]]

or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the 
benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any 
program to which this part applies.
    (b) Specific discriminatory actions prohibited. (1) A recipient 
under any program to which this part applies may not directly or through 
contractual or other arrangements, on the ground of race, color, or 
national origin:
    (i) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit 
provided under the program;
    (ii) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to an 
individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner, 
from that provided to others under the program;
    (iii) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in 
any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or 
other benefit under the program;
    (iv) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any 
advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, 
financial aid, or other benefit under the program;
    (v) Treat an individual differently from others in determining 
whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, 
membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet 
in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit 
provided under the program;
    (vi) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program 
through the provision of services or otherwise or afford him an 
opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under 
the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program of 
an employee but only to the extent set forth in paragraph (c) of this 
section).
    (2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial 
aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any 
such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in 
which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will 
be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be 
afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not 
directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria 
or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting 
individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national 
origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing 
accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respects individuals 
of a particular race, color, or national origin.
    (3) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient 
or applicant may not make selections with the purpose or effect of 
excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting 
them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation 
applies, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin; or with the 
purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the 
accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this regulation.
    (4) As used in this section the services, financial aid, or other 
benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance 
shall be deemed to include any service, financial aid, or other benefit 
provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal 
financial assistance.
    (5) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination 
in this paragraph and paragraph (c) of this section does not limit the 
generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (6) This regulation does not prohibit the consideration of race, 
color, or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove or 
overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have 
restricted the availability of, or participation in, the program or 
activity receiving Federal financial assistance, on the grounds of race, 
color, or national origin. Where previous discriminatory practice or 
usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to 
exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, 
or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to 
which this regulation applies the applicant or recipient has an 
obligation to take reasonable action to remove or overcome the 
consequences of the prior

[[Page 113]]

discriminatory practice or usage, and to accomplish the purposes of the 
Act.
    (c) Employment practices. (1) Where a primary objective of the 
Federal financial assistance to a program to which this part applies is 
to provide employment, a recipient may not directly or through 
contractual or other arrangements subject an individual to 
discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its 
employment practices under such program (including recruitment or 
recruitment advertising, employment, layoff or termination, upgrading, 
demotion, or transfer, rates of pay or other forms of compensation and 
use of facilities), including programs where a primary objective of the 
Federal financial assistance is (i) to assist such individuals through 
employment to meet expenses incident to the commencement or continuation 
of their education or training or (ii) to provide work experience which 
contributes to the education or training of such individuals.
    (2) Programs listed in Appendix A as respects employment 
opportunities provided thereunder, or in facilities provided thereunder, 
which are limited, or for which preference is given, to students, 
fellows, or other persons, including research associates, where in 
training for the same or related employments, have one of the above 
purposes as a primary purpose.
    (3) The requirements applicable to construction employment under any 
such program shall be those specified in or pursuant to part III of 
Executive Order 11246 or any Executive order which supersedes it.
    (4) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is 
not to provide employment, but discrimination on the grounds of race, 
color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient 
or other persons subject to the regulation tends, on the grounds of 
race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from 
participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to 
discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, the 
provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall apply to the 
employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the 
regulation, to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity 
to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries.
    (d) Medical emergencies. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of 
this section, a recipient of Federal financial assistance shall not be 
deemed to have failed to comply with paragraph (a) of this section if 
immediate provision of a service or other benefit to an individual is 
necessary to prevent his death or serious impairment of his health, and 
such service or other benefit cannot be provided except by or through a 
medical institution which refuses or fails to comply with paragraph (a) 
of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 611.4  Assurances required.

    (a) General. (1) Every application for Federal financial assistance 
to carry out a program to which this part applies, and every application 
for Federal financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a 
condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial 
assistance pursuant to the application, contain or be accompanied by an 
assurance that the program will be conducted or the facility operated in 
compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part. In 
the case where the Federal financial assistance is to provide or is in 
the form of personal property, or real property or interest therein or 
structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or, in 
the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during 
which the property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial 
assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of 
similar services and benefits, or for as long as the recipient retains 
ownership or possession of the property, whichever is longer. In all 
other cases the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period 
during which Federal Financial assistance is extended pursuant to the 
application. The responsible Foundation official shall specify the form 
of the foregoing assurances for each program and the extent to which 
like assurances will be required of subgrantees, contractors

[[Page 114]]

and subcontractors, successors in interest, and other participants in 
the program. Any such assurance shall include provisions which give the 
United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.
    (2) In the case where Federal financial assistance is provided in 
the form of a transfer of real property, structures, or improvements 
thereon, or interest therein, from the Federal Government, the 
instrument effecting or recording the transfer shall contain a covenant 
running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during 
which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal 
financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the 
provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property 
or interest therein from the Federal Government is involved, but 
property is acquired or improved under a program of Federal financial 
assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such covenant in any 
subsequent transfer of such property. When the property is obtained from 
the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition 
coupled with a right to be reserved by the Foundation to revert title to 
the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the 
discretion of the responsible Foundation official, such a condition and 
right of reverter is appropriate to the program under which the real 
property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In 
such event if a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or 
otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing 
construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such 
property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the 
responsible Foundation official may agree, upon request of the 
transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such 
conditions as he deems appropriate, to subordinate such right of 
reversion to the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance.
    (3) Transfers of surplus property are subject to regulations issued 
by the Administrator of the General Services Administration. (41 CFR 
101-6.2.)
    (b) Elementary and secondary schools. The requirements of paragraph 
(a) of this section with respect to any elementary or secondary school 
or school system shall be deemed to be satisfied if such school or 
school system (1) is subject to a final order of a court of the United 
States for the desegregation of such school or school system, and 
provides an assurance that it will comply with such order, including any 
future modification of such order, or (2) submits a plan for the 
desegregation of such school or school system which the responsible 
Official of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare determines 
is adequate to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this part, and 
provides reasonable assurance that it will carry out such plan. In any 
case of continuing Federal financial assistance the responsible Official 
of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare may reserve the 
right to redetermine, after such period as may be specified by him, the 
adequacy of the plan to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this 
part. In any case in which a final order of a court of the United States 
for the desegregation of such school or school system is entered after 
submission of such a plan, such plan shall be revised to conform to such 
final order, including any future modification of such order.
    (c) Assurances from institutions. (1) In the case of any application 
for Federal financial assistance to an institution of higher education 
(including assistance for construction, for research for a special 
training project, or for any other purpose), the assurance required by 
this section shall extend to admission practices and to all other 
practices relating to the treatment of students.
    (2) The assurance required with respect to an institution of higher 
education, hospital, or any other institution, insofar as the assurance 
relates to the institution's practices with respect to admission or 
other treatment of individuals as students, patients, or clients of the 
institution or to the opportunity to participate in the provision of 
services or other benefits to such individuals, shall be applicable to 
the entire institution unless the applicant establishes, to the 
satisfaction of the responsible Foundation official, that the

[[Page 115]]

institution's practices in designated parts or programs of the 
institution will in no way affect its practices in the program of the 
institution for which Federal financial assistance is sought, or the 
beneficiaries of or participants in such program. If in any such case 
the assistance sought is for the construction of a facility or part of a 
facility, the assurance shall in any event extend to the entire facility 
and to facilities operated in connection therewith.

<R05>
Sec. 611.5  Illustrative applications.

    The following examples will illustrate the application of the 
foregoing provisions to some of the programs of the Foundation. (In all 
cases the discrimination prohibited is discrimination on the ground of 
race, color, or national origin prohibited by title VI of the Act and 
this part, as a condition of the receipt of Federal financial 
assistance.)

    1. In programs for support to elementary or secondary schools such 
as for the acquisition of equipment discrimination by the recipient 
school district in any of its elementary or secondary schools, or by the 
recipient private institution, in the admission of students, or in the 
treatment of its students in any aspect of the educational process, is 
prohibited. In this and the following illustration the prohibition of 
discrimination in the treatment of students or other trainees includes 
the prohibition of discrimination among the students or trainees in the 
availability or use of any academic, dormitory, eating, recreational, or 
other facilities of the grantee or other recipient.
    2. In a research, training, or other grant to a university for 
activities to be conducted in a graduate school, discrimination in the 
admission and treatment of students in the graduate school is 
prohibited, and the prohibition extends to the entire university unless 
it satisfies the responsible Foundation official that practices with 
respect to other parts or programs of the university will not interfere, 
directly or indirectly, with fulfillment of the assurance required with 
respect to the graduate school.
    3. In a training grant to a hospital or other nonacademic 
institution, discrimination is prohibited in the selection of 
individuals to be trained and in their treatment by the grantee during 
their training. In a research or demonstration grant to such an 
institution, discrimination is prohibited with respect to any 
educational activity, any provision of medical or other services and any 
financial aid to individuals incident to the program.
    4. In grant programs to assist in the construction of facilities for 
research or for the provision of educational services, assurances will 
be required that services will be provided without discrimination, to 
the same extent that discrimination would be prohibited as a condition 
of Federal operating grants for the support of such services. Thus, as a 
condition of grants for the construction of academic, research, or other 
facilities at institutions of higher education, assurances will be 
required that there will be no discrimination in the admission or 
treatment of students. In other construction grants the assurances 
required will similarly be adapted to the nature of the activities to be 
conducted in the facilities for construction of which the grants have 
been authorized by Congress.
    5. Upon transfers of real or personal property for research or 
educational uses, discrimination is prohibited to the same extent as in 
the case of grants for the construction of facilities or the provision 
of equipment for like purposes.
    6. In some situations even though past discriminatory practices have 
been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to impede 
the full availability of a benefit. If the efforts required of the 
applicant or recipient under Sec. 611.6(d) to provide information as to 
the availability of the program or activity, and the rights of 
beneficiaries under this regulation, have failed to overcome these 
consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient 
to take additional steps to make the benefits fully available to racial 
and nationality groups previously subjected to discrimination. This 
action might take the form, for example, of special arrangements for 
obtaining referrals which will insure that groups previously subjected 
to discrimination are adequately served but not the establishment of 
discriminatory qualifications for participation in any program.
    7. Even though an applicant or recipient has never used 
discriminatory policies, the services and benefits of the program or 
activity it administers may not in fact be equally available to some 
racial or nationality groups. In such circumstances an applicant or 
recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or 
national origin to make the benefits of its program more widely 
available to such groups, not then being adequately served. For example, 
where a university is not adequately serving members of a particular 
racial or nationality group, it may establish special recruitment 
policies to make its program better known and more readily available to 
such group,

[[Page 116]]

and take other steps to provide that group with more adequate service.

<R05>
Sec. 611.6  Compliance information.

    (a) Cooperation and assistance. The responsible Foundation official 
shall, to the fullest extent practicable, seek the cooperation of 
recipients in obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide 
assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily 
with this part.
    (b) Compliance reports. Each recipient shall keep such records and 
submit to the responsible Foundation official timely, complete and 
accurate compliance reports at such times, and in such form and 
containing such information, as the responsible Foundation official may 
determine to be necessary to enable him to ascertain whether the 
recipient has complied or is complying with this part. In the case of 
any program under which a primary recipient extends Federal financial 
assistance to any other recipient, such other recipient shall also 
submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be 
necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations 
under this part.
    (c) Access to sources of information. Each recipient shall permit 
access by the responsible Foundation official or his designee during 
normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other 
sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to 
ascertain compliance with this part. Where any information required of a 
recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, 
institution or person and this agency, institution or person shall fail 
or refuse to furnish this information, the recipient shall so certify in 
its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the 
information.
    (d) Information to beneficiaries and participants. Each recipient 
shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other 
interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this 
part and its applicability to the program under which the recipient 
receives Federal financial assistance, and make such information 
available to them in such manner, as the responsible Foundation official 
finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against 
discrimination assured them by the Act and this part.

<R05>
Sec. 611.7  Conduct of investigations.

    (a) Periodic compliance reviews. The responsible Foundation official 
shall from time to time review the practices of recipients to determine 
whether they are complying with this part.
    (b) Complaints. Any person who believes himself or any specific 
class of individuals to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by 
this part may by himself or by a representative file with the 
responsible Foundation official a written complaint. A complaint must be 
filed not later than 90 days from the date of the alleged 
discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the 
responsible Foundation official.
    (c) Investigations. The responsible Foundation official will make a 
prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or 
any other information indicates a possible failure to comply with this 
part. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of 
the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the circumstances 
under which the possible noncompliance with this part occurred, and 
other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the recipient 
has failed to comply with this part.
    (d) Resolution of matters. (1) If an investigation pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with this 
regulation, the responsible Foundation official will so inform the 
recipient and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever 
possible. If it has been determined that the matter cannot be resolved 
by informal means, action will be taken as provided for in Sec. 611.8.
    (2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section the responsible Foundation official 
will so inform the recipient and the complainant, if any, in writing.

[[Page 117]]

    (e) Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited. No recipient or 
other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against 
any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or 
privilege secured by section 601 of the Act or this part, or because he 
has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner 
in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part. The 
identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent 
necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct 
of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising 
thereunder.


<R05>
Sec. 611.8  Procedure for effecting compliance.

    (a) General. If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure 
to comply with this part, and if the noncompliance or threatened 
noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with 
this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal 
to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance or by any other 
means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not 
limited to (1) a reference to the Department of Justice with a 
recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any 
rights of the United States under any law of the United States 
(including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other 
contractual undertaking, and (2) any applicable proceeding under State 
or local law.
    (b) Noncompliance with Sec. 611.4. If an applicant fails or refuses 
to furnish an assurance required under Sec. 611.4 or otherwise fails to 
comply with that section, Federal financial assistance may be refused in 
accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The 
Foundation shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case 
during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such 
subsection, except that the Foundation shall continue assistance during 
the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and 
payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to the 
effective date of this part.
    (c) Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal 
financial assistance. No order suspending, terminating, or refusing to 
grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective 
until:

    (1) The responsible Foundation official has advised the applicant or 
recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance 
cannot be secured by voluntary means,
    (2) There has been an express finding on the record, after 
opportunity for hearings, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to 
comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part,
    (3) The action has been approved by the Director pursuant to 
Sec. 611.10(e) and
    (4) The expiration of thirty days after the Director has filed with 
the Committee of the House and the Committee of the Senate having 
legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written 
report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action.

Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue 
Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular 
political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to 
whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to 
the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has 
been so found.
    (d) Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance by 
any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) the 
responsible Foundation official has determined that compliance cannot be 
secured by voluntary means, (2) the recipient or other person has been 
notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to 
effect compliance, and (3) the expiration of at least ten days from the 
mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person. During this 
period of at least ten days additional efforts shall be made to persuade 
the recipient or other person to comply with this part and to take such 
corrective action as may be appropriate.

Sec. 611.9  Hearings.

    (a) Opportunity for hearing. Whenever an opportunity for a hearing 
is required by Sec. 611.8(b), reasonable notice shall be given by 
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected 
applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or 
recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision 
under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the 
matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either 
(1) fix a date not less than twenty days after the date of such notice 
within which the applicant or recipient may request of the responsible 
Foundation official that the matter be scheduled for hearing or (2) 
advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been 
set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so 
fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The 
complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the 
hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit 
written information and argument for the record. The failure of an 
applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph or to 
appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be 
a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and 
Sec. 611.8(c) and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of 
such information as is available.
    (b) Time and place of hearing. Hearings shall be held at the offices 
of the Foundation in Arlington, VA, at a time fixed by the responsible 
Foundation official unless he determines that the convenience of the 
applicant or recipient or of the Foundation requires that another place 
be selected. Hearings shall be held before the responsible Foundation 
official or, at the discretion of the Director, a hearing examiner 
designated in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3105 and 3344.
    (c) Right to counsel. In all proceedings under this section, the 
applicant or recipient and the Foundation shall have the right to be 
represented by counsel.
    (d) Procedures, evidence, and record. (1) The hearing, decision, and 
any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with 
5 U.S.C. 554 through 557, and in accordance with such rules of procedure 
as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the 
conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided 
for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, 
arguments and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters. 
Both the Foundation and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to 
introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice 
for hearing or as determined by the officer conducting the hearing at 
the outset of or during the hearing.
    (2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings 
conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to 
assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject 
testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably 
necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may 
exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All 
documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be 
open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to 
refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A 
transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the 
substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be 
based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.
    (e) Consolidated or joint hearings. In cases in which the same or 
related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this part 
with respect to two or more programs to which this part applies or 
noncompliance with this part and the regulations of one or more other 
Federal departments or agencies issued under title VI of the Act, the 
Director may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies, 
where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint 
hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules of procedure 
not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in such cases, insofar 
as this part

[[Page 119]]

is concerned, shall be made in accordance with Sec. 611.10.

[29 FR 16305, Dec. 4, 1964, as amended at 38 FR 17985, July 5, 1973; 59 
FR 37437, July 22, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 611.10  Decisions and notices.

    (a) Decision by a person or persons other than the responsible 
Foundation official. If the hearing is held by a hearing examiner, such 
hearing examiner shall either make an initial decision, if so 
authorized, or certify the entire record including recommended findings 
and proposed decision to the responsible Foundation official for a final 
decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be 
mailed to the applicant or recipient. Where the initial decision is made 
by the hearing examiner, the applicant or recipient may within 30 days 
of the mailing of such notice of initial decision file with the 
responsible Foundation official his exceptions to the initial decision, 
with his reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the responsible 
Foundation official may on his own motion within 45 days after the 
initial decision serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that he 
will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such 
notice of review the responsible Foundation official shall review the 
initial decision and issue his own decision thereon including the 
reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of 
review the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the 
responsible Foundation official.
    (b) Decisions on record or review by the responsible Foundation 
official. Whenever, after hearing, a record is certified to the 
responsible Foundation official for decision or he reviews the decision 
of a hearing examiner pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or 
whenever the responsible Foundation official conducts the hearing, the 
applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file 
with him briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a 
copy of the final decision of the responsible Foundation official shall 
be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to the 
complainant, if any.
    (c) Decisions on record where a hearing is waived. Whenever a 
hearing is waived pursuant to Sec. 611.9(a), a decision shall be made by 
the responsible Foundation official on the record and a copy of such 
decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to 
the complainant, if any.
    (d) Rulings required. Each decision of a hearing officer, panel, or 
responsible Foundation official shall set forth the ruling on each 
finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the 
requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with 
which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.
    (e) Approval by Director. Any final decision of a responsible 
Foundation official (other than the Director) which provides for the 
suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue 
Federal financial assistance, or the imposition of any other sanction 
available under this part or the Act, shall promptly be transmitted to 
the Director who may approve such decision, may vacate it, or remit or 
mitigate any sanction imposed.
    (f) Content of orders. The final decision may provide for suspension 
or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial 
assistance, in whole or in part, under the program involved, and may 
contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent 
with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part, 
including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial 
assistance will thereafter be extended under such program to the 
applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in default in 
its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to this part, or to 
have otherwise failed to comply with this part, unless and until it 
corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the responsible Foundation 
official that it will fully comply with this part.
    (g) Posttermination proceedings. (1) An applicant or recipient 
adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this 
section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal 
financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that 
order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with 
this regulation and provides reasonable assurance that

[[Page 120]]

it will fully comply with this regulation.
    (2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order 
entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time 
request the responsible Foundation official to restore fully its 
eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request 
shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or 
recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. 
If the responsible Foundation official determines that those 
requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility.
    (3) If the responsible Foundation official denies any such request, 
the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in 
writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. 
It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on 
the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the 
responsible Foundation official. The applicant or recipient will be 
restored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it 
satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While 
proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by 
the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in 
effect.

[29 FR 16305, Dec. 4, 1964, as amended at 38 FR 17985, July 5, 1973; 51 
FR 22939, June 24, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 611.11  Judicial review.

    Action taken pursuant to section 602 of the Act is subject to 
judicial review as provided in section 603 of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 611.12  Effect on other regulations; forms and instructions.

    (a) Effect on other regulations. All regulations, orders, or like 
directions heretofore issued by any officer of the Foundation which 
impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against 
individuals on the ground of race, color, or national origin under any 
program to which this part applies, and which authorize the suspension 
or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial 
assistance to any applicant for or recipient of such assistance under 
such program for failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby 
superseded to the extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this 
part, except that nothing in this part shall be deemed to relieve any 
person of any obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded 
regulation, order, instruction, or like direction prior to the effective 
date of this part. Nothing in this part, however, supersedes any of the 
following (including future amendments thereof): (1) Executive Order 
11246 and regulation issued thereunder, or (2) any other orders, 
regulations, or instructions, insofar as such orders, regulations, or 
instructions prohibit discrimination on the ground of race, color, or 
national origin in any program or situation to which this part is 
inapplicable, or prohibit discrimination on any other ground.
    (b) Forms and instructions. Each responsible Foundation official 
shall issue and promptly make available to interested persons forms and 
detailed instructions and procedures for effectuating this part as 
applied to programs to which this part applies and for which he is 
responsible.
    (c) Supervision and coordination. The Director may from time to time 
assign to officials of other departments or agencies of the Government, 
with the consent of such departments or agencies, responsibilities in 
connection with the effectuation of the purposes of title VI of the Act 
and this part (other than responsibility for final decision as provided 
in Sec. 611.10), including the achievement of effective coordination and 
maximum uniformity within the Foundation and within the Executive Branch 
of the Government in the application of title VI and this regulation to 
similar programs and in similar situations. Any action taken, 
determination made, or requirement imposed by an official of another 
Department or agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility 
under this subsection shall have the same effect as though such action 
had been taken by the responsible official of this agency.

Sec. 612.3  Procedures applicable to the public--requests and appeals.

    (a) Publications excluded. For the purpose of public requests for 
records the term record does not include publications which are 
available to the public in the Federal Register, or by sale or free 
distribution. Such publications may be obtained from the Government 
Printing Office, the National Technical Information Service, the NSF 
Forms and Publications Unit or NSF grantees or contractors. Requests for 
such publications will be referred to or the requester informed of the 
appropriate source. The booklet, Publications of the National Science 
Foundation, which is available without charge from Forms and 
Publications, National Science Foundation, 4201 Wilson Boulevard, 
Arlington, VA 22230, identifies Annual Reports, Descriptive Brochures, 
Program Announcements, Science Resources Studies, Special Studies, and 
Periodicals descriptive of Foundation activities, policies, and 
procedures, sets forth the cost of each, and tells how copies may be 
obtained.
    (b) Form of request. A request need not be in any particular format, 
but it: (1) Must be in writing and include the requester's mailing 
address, (2) must be clearly identified both on the envelope and in the 
letter as a Freedom of Information Act or FOIA request, (3) must

[[Page 123]]

describe the records sought with sufficient specificity to permit 
identification, and (4) must state that the requester promptly will pay 
the fees chargeable under this regulation. Provided, however, that when 
the requester places an inadequate limit on the amount he will pay or 
the requester has failed to make payments for previous requests, the NSF 
may require advance payment in accordance with Sec. 612.12(d) of this 
part except in cases when fees have been waived or reduced in accordance 
with Sec. 612.13 of this part.
    (c) Place of request. Any request for records under FOIA shall be 
addressed to the National Science Foundation, Office of General Counsel, 
4201 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22230, except that requests for 
records maintained by the Office of the Inspector General may be 
addressed to either the Office of General Counsel, National Science 
Foundation, 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22230 or to the Office 
of the Inspector General, National Science Foundation, 4201 Wilson 
Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22230. A request which meets the requirements 
of paragraph (b) of this section and is properly addressed will be 
deemed received on the date of arrival in the Office of General Counsel 
or the Office of the Inspector General.
    (d) Time for appeal. A person whose request has been denied or 
partially denied may initiate an appeal by filing a request for review 
within ten days of the receipt of the denial, Saturdays, Sundays, legal 
public holidays, and the date of receipt excluded.
    (e) Form of appeal. The appeal shall include a copy of the written 
request and the denial together with any written argument the requester 
wishes to submit, and shall be signed by the requester.
    (f) To whom appeal is made. An appeal shall be addressed to the 
General Counsel, National Science Foundation, 4201 Wilson Boulevard, 
Arlington, VA 22230.
    (g) Decisions on appeal. Decisions on appeal shall be made by the 
General Counsel in writing within 20 days (excepting the date of 
receipt, Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from receipt of 
the appeal. If the decision is in favor of the requester it shall order 
the record made available promptly to the requester. If adverse to the 
requester in whole or in part it shall briefly state the reasons and 
notify the requester that he may seek judicial review of the decision 
pursuant to paragraph (4) of section 552(a), title 5, United States 
Code.

<R05>
Sec. 612.4  Copies of records.

Records will not be released for copying.

[56 FR 47416, Sept. 19, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 612.5  Creation of records.

    A record will not be created by compiling selected items from other 
documents at the request of a member of the public nor will a record be 
created by analysis, computation or other processing specifically for 
the requesting party. If such analysis or computation is available in 
the form of a record, copies shall be made available as provided in this 
regulation.

[40 FR 12793, Mar. 21, 1975]


<R05>
Sec. 612.6  Confidential commercial information--notice.

    (a) In general. Commercial information provided to the NSF by a 
submitter shall not be disclosed pursuant to a Freedom of Information 
Act request except in accordance with this section.
    (b) Definitions. The following definitions are used in reference to 
this section:
    Commercial information means information provided to the NSF by a 
submitter that arguably is protected from disclosure under section b(4) 
of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) and 
Sec. 612.8(a)(4) of this part.
    Submitter means any person, organization, or entity who provides 
commercial information, directly or indirectly, to the NSF. The term 
includes, but is not limited to, corporations, state governments and 
foreign governments.

[[Page 124]]

    (c) Designation of commercial information. Submitters of commercial 
information shall use good-faith efforts to designate, by appropriate 
markings, either at the time of submission or within a reasonable time 
thereafter, those portions of their submissions which they deem to be 
protected from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) and Sec. 612.8(a)(4) 
of this part. Such designations shall be deemed to have expired ten 
years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests, 
and provides reasonable justification for, a designation period of 
greater duration.
    (d) Notice to submitters. The NSF shall, to the extent permitted by 
law, provide a submitter with written notice of a Freedom of Information 
Act request or administrative appeal encompassing its commercial 
information wherever required under paragraph (e) of this section, 
except as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section. Such written 
notice, given in order to afford the submitter an opportunity to object 
to disclosure pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, shall be given 
within a reasonable time after NSF's receipt of the Freedom of 
Information Act request or administrative appeal, consistent with 
statutory requirements, and shall either describe the exact nature of 
the commercial information requested or provide copies of the records or 
portions thereof containing the information. The requester also shall be 
notified that notice and an opportunity to object are being provided to 
a submitter.
    (e) When notice is required. Notice shall be given to a submitter 
whenever:
    (1) The information has been designated in good faith by the 
submitter as information deemed protected from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 
552(b)(4) and Sec. 612.8(a)(4) of this part, or
    (2) The NSF has reason to believe that the information may be 
protected from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) and Sec. 612.8(a)(4) 
of this part.
    (f) Exceptions to notice requirements. The notice requirements of 
paragraph (d) of this section shall not apply if:
    (1) The NSF determines that the information should not be disclosed;
    (2) The information lawfully has been published or has been 
officially made available to the public;
    (3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 
U.S.C. 552); or
    (4) The designation made by the submitter in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous, except that, 
in such case, the NSF shall send to the submitter written notice of any 
final administrative decision to disclose commercial information at 
least ten days prior to a specified disclosure date.
    (g) Opportunity to object to disclosure. Through the notice 
described in paragraph (d) of this section, the NSF shall afford a 
submitter a reasonable time, consistent with statutory requirements, 
within which to provide the NSF with a detailed written statement of any 
objection to disclosure. Such statement shall specify all grounds for 
withholding any of the information under any exemption of the Freedom of 
Information Act and, in the case of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) and 
Sec. 612.8(a)(4) of this part, shall provide a detailed description of 
why the information is a trade secret or commercial or financial 
information that is privileged or confidential. This description shall 
explain why release of commercial or financial information would cause 
substantial harm to the competitive position of the submitter. Whenever 
possible, the submitter's claim of confidentiality should be supported 
by a statement or certification by an officer or authorized 
representative of the submitter. Information provided by a submitter 
pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the 
FOIA. When the submitter fails to object within the specified time or 
the objection appears obviously frivolous, the NSF shall provide the 
submitter with written notice pursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this 
section.
    (h) Notice of intent to disclose. The NSF shall consider a 
submitter's objections and specific grounds for non-disclosure prior to 
determining whether to disclose confidential information. Whenever the 
Foundation decides to disclose confidential information over the 
objection of a submitter, the NSF shall forward to the submitter a 
written notice which shall include:

[[Page 125]]

    (1) A statement of the reasons for which the submitter's disclosure 
objections wee not sustained;
    (2) A description of the confidential information to be disclosed; 
and
    (3) A specified disclosure date.

Such notice of intent to disclose shall be forwarded to the submitter at 
least ten days prior to the specified disclosure date and the requester 
shall be notified likewise.
    (i) Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester brings suit seeking 
to compel disclosure of confidential information, the NSF shall promptly 
notify the submitter.

<R05>
Sec. 612.7  Agency actions on receipt of a properly presented request for record.

    (a) Monitoring of requests. The NSF Office of General Counsel, or 
such other office as may be designated by the Director, will serve as 
the central office for internal administration of these regulations. For 
records maintained by the Office of Inspector General, that Office will 
control incoming requests made directly to it, dispatch response 
letters, and maintain administrative records. For all other records 
maintained by NSF, the Office of General Counsel, or such other office 
as may be designated by the Director, will control incoming requests, 
assign them to appropriate action offices, monitor compliance, consult 
with action offices on disclosure, approve unavoidable extensions, 
dispatch denial and other letters, and maintain administrative records.
    (b) Time for response. The Foundation will seek to take appropriate 
agency action on a request within 10 days of its receipt (excepting the 
date of receipt, Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). If the 
record may exist only in a retired file which has been placed in storage 
or there is otherwise a need to search for and collect the requested 
records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate 
from the Foundation, NSF shall immediately notify the requester by 
letter that the record has been ordered from storage (or is otherwise 
being sought) and that the time limit for acting on the request is 
extended by the length of time required to obtain the record. The letter 
will also give the date on which a determination is expected to be 
dispatched. If the request seeks a voluminous amount of separate and 
distinct records requiring an unusual length of time for search, 
collection, and appropriate examination, and determination on the 
request cannot be made within 10 working days after agency receipt, NSF 
shall within such ten-day period furnish to the requester written notice 
extending the period for not more than ten working days. This notice 
shall set forth the reasons for such extension and the date on which a 
determination is expected to be dispatched. If the record has not been 
obtained and examined and notice of the determination whether to comply 
with the request has not been given by the last day of the period as 
extended, the requester shall be notified on that last day that the 
request is denied because the record has not yet been found and 
examined. Such denial shall state that NSF will reconsider the denial as 
soon as the search and examination is complete, which should be within a 
specifically stated number of days, but that the requester may, if he 
wishes, file an administrative appeal as provided in Sec. 612.3 of this 
regulation. This same procedure for extending the period shall be 
followed if the nature of the record requires consultation with another 
agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request 
or requires consultation among two or more components of NSF having 
substantial subject-matter interest therein.
    (c) Records containing commercial information. When the requested 
record contains confidential commercial information such as a successful 
proposal that was submitted to NSF, the NSF will normally contact, in 
accordance with Sec. 612.6 of this part, the organization that submitted 
the record in order to ask whether the submitter wished portions of the 
records withheld under any applicable exemptions. (The Foundation 
protects from disclosure pending proposals or unsuccessful proposals in 
any case.)
    (d) Denial of request No written request for records shall be denied 
except

[[Page 126]]

by the Office of General Counsel, the Office of Inspector General or 
such other office as may be designated by the Director. Notice of the 
denial of a request shall briefly set forth the reasons therefor which 
shall be based solely upon one or more of the exemptions specified in 
Sec. 612.8 of this part. Each notice of denial shall set forth the names 
and title or positions of each person responsible for the denial and 
shall inform the requester of the right to appeal as provided in 
Sec. 612.3 of this part.
    (e) Oral requests. Nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to 
preclude NSF from honoring oral requests for information where feasible, 
but if the requester is dissatisfied with the disposition of such a 
request, he shall be asked to put the request in writing.

Sec. 612.8  Records not available.

    (a) Exemptions. The following types of records are not normally 
available for inspection and copying:
    (1) Records specifically authorized and in fact properly classified 
pursuant to Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of 
national defense or foreign policy.
    (2) Records related solely to the internal personnel rules and 
practices of NSF. This exemption does not apply to rules relating to the 
work hours, leave, and working conditions of NSF personnel, or similar 
matters, to the extent that they can be disclosed without harm to the 
functions to which they pertain. Examples of exempt records of the type 
specified in the first sentence of this paragraph include, but are not 
limited to:
    (i) Operating rules, guidelines, manuals on internal procedure, 
schedules and methods utilized by NSF auditors and examiners;
    (ii) Negotiating positions and limitations involved in a negotiation 
prior to the execution of a contract or the completion of the action to 
which the negotiating positions or limitations were applicable. They may 
also be exempt pursuant to other provisions of this section.
    (iii) Personnel policies, procedures and instructions, internal 
staffing plans, requirements, authorizations, controls, and supporting 
data relating to position management and manpower utilization and 
information involved in the determination of the qualifications of 
candidates for employment or advancement.
    (3) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute such as 
18 U.S.C. 1905 which prohibits disclosure of information which concerns 
or relates to the trade secrets, processes, operations, style of work, 
or apparatus or to the identity, confidential statistical data, amount 
or source of any income, profits, losses, or expenditures of any person, 
firm, partnership, corporation or association. This also includes 
records that disclose any invention in which the Federal Government owns 
or may own a right, title, or interest (including a nonexclusive 
license) as provided in 35 U.S.C. 205.
    (4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained 
from a person and privileged or confidential. Matter subject to this 
exemption is that which is customarily held in confidence by the 
originator without regard to whether or not the originator is, or is not 
employed by, a nonprofit organization. It includes, but is not limited 
to:
    (i) Information received in confidence, such as grant applications, 
fellowship applications and research proposals prior to award;
    (ii) Statistical data or information if received in confidence from 
a contractor or potential contractor concerning contract performance, 
income, profits, losses, and expenditures.
    (5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would 
not be available by law to a private party in litigation with NSF. To 
the extent not so available by law, examples include, but are not 
limited to:
    (i) Reports, memoranda, correspondence, workpapers, minutes of 
meetings (other than those governed by the Federal Advisory Committee 
Act), and staff papers prepared for use within NSF or within the 
Executive Branch of the Government by personnel and consultants of NSF, 
or any Government agency.

[[Page 127]]

    (ii) Advance information on proposed NSF plans to procure, lease, or 
otherwise acquire, or dispose of materials, real estate, facilities, 
services or functions, when such information would provide undue or 
unfair competitive advantage to any person;
    (iii) Records prepared for use in proceedings before any Federal or 
State court or administrative body;
    (iv) Evaluations of and comments on specific grant applications, 
research proposals, or potential contractors, whether made by NSF 
personnel or by external reviewers acting either individually or in 
committees;
    (v) Preliminary, draft unapproved recommendations, evaluations, and 
opinions, such as evaluations of invention disclosures, of research 
projects, and of incomplete studies conducted or supported by NSF;
    (vi) Proposed budget requests and supporting projections used or 
arising in the preparation and/or execution of a budget; proposed annual 
and multi-year policy, priorities, program and financial plan and 
supporting papers.
    (6) Personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of 
which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy. Information in such files which is not otherwise exempt from 
disclosure pursuant to other provisions of this section will be released 
to the subject or to his designated legal representative, and it may be 
disclosed to others with his written consent. Examples of personnel 
files exempt from disclosure include, but are not limited to, file 
containing reports, records and other materials pertaining to individual 
cases in which disciplinary or other administrative action has been or 
may be taken. Similar files include reports and evaluations which 
reflect upon the qualifications or competence of individuals. Opinions 
and orders resulting from those proceedings shall be disclosed without 
identifying details if used, cited, or relied upon as precedent.
    (7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, 
but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement 
records or information:
    (i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement 
proceedings,
    (ii) Would deprive a person or a right to a fair trial or an 
impartial adjudication,
    (iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy,
    (iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a 
confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or 
authority or any private institution which furnished information on a 
confidential basis,
    (v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement 
investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law 
enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could 
reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law, or
    (vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical 
safety of any individual.
    (8) Matters contained in or related to examination, operating, or 
condition reports prepared by, or on behalf of, or for the use of any 
government agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of 
financial institutions.
    (9) Geological and geophysical information and data (including maps) 
concerning wells.
    (10) Records belonging to another government agency or dealing with 
subject matter as to which government agency, other than NSF, has 
exclusive or primary responsibility. Requests for such records shall be 
promptly forwarded to the appropriate government agency for disposition 
or for guidance with respect to disposition.
    (b) Deletion of exempt portion and identifying details. Any 
reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any 
person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are 
exempt. Whenever any final opinion, order, or other materials required 
to be made available relates to a private party or parties and the 
release of the name or names or other identifying details will 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, the 
record shall be published or made available with such identifying 
details left blank, or shall be published or

[[Page 128]]

made available with obviously fictitious substitutes and with a 
notification such as the following as a preamble:

    Names of parties and certain other identifying details have been 
removed (and fictitious names substituted) in order to prevent a clearly 
unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the individuals 
involved.

<R05>
Sec. 612.9  Fees to be charged--definitions.

    For the purpose of these Guidelines:
    (a) All the terms defined in the Freedom of Information Act apply.
    (b) A statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees 
for particular types of records (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(vi)) means any 
statute that specifically requires a government agency, such as the 
Government Printing Office (GPO) or the National Technical Information 
Service (NTIS), to set the level of fees for particular types of 
records, in order to:
    (1) Serve both the general public and private sector organizations 
by conveniently making available government information;
    (2) Ensure that groups and individuals pay the cost of publications 
and other services which are for their special use so that these costs 
are not borne by the general taxpaying public;
    (3) Operate an information dissemination activity on a self-
sustaining basis to the maximum extent possible; or
    (4) Return revenue to the Treasury for defraying, wholly or in part, 
appropriated funds used to pay the cost of disseminating government 
information. Statutes, such as the User Fee Statute, which only provide 
a general discussion of fees without explicitly requiring that an agency 
set and collect fees for particular documents do not supersede the 
Freedom of Information Act under section (a)(4)(A)(vi) of that statute.
    (c) The term direct costs means those expenditures which an agency 
actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of 
commercial requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA 
request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee 
performing work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent 
of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating 
machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as 
costs of space, and heating or lighting the facility in which the 
records are stored.
    (d) The term search includes all time spent looking for material 
that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line 
identification of material within documents. NSF shall ensure that 
searching for material is done in the most efficient and least expensive 
manner so as to minimize costs for both the agency and the requester. 
For example, NSF shall not engage in line-by-line search when merely 
duplicating an entire document would prove the less expensive and 
quicker method of complying with a request. ``Search'' should be 
distinguished, moreover, from ``review'' of material in order to 
determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure (see paragraph 
(f) of this section). Searches may be done manually or by computer using 
existing programming.
    (e) The term duplication refers to the process of making a copy of a 
document necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take 
the form of paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine 
readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The 
copy provided must be in a form that is reasonably usable by requesters.
    (f) The term review refers to the process of examining documents 
located in response to a request that is for a commercial use (see 
paragraph (g) of this section) to determine whether any portion of any 
document located is permitted to be withheld. It also includes 
processing any documents for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is 
necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release. Review 
does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues 
regarding the application of exemptions.
    (g) The term `commercial use' request refers to a request from or on 
behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers 
the commercial,

[[Page 129]]

trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose 
behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester properly 
belongs in this category, NSF shall determine the use to which a 
requester will put the documents requested. Moreover, where NSF has 
reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the 
records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, 
NSF shall seek additional clarification before assigning the request to 
a specific category.
    (h) The term educational institution refers to a preschool, a public 
or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate 
higher education, an institution of professional education, and an 
institution of vocational education, which operates a program or 
programs of scholarly research.
    (i) The term non-commercial scientific institution refers to an 
institution that is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term 
is referenced in paragraph (g) of this section, and which is operated 
solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of 
which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.
    (j) The term representative of the news media refers to any person 
actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to 
publish or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information 
that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the 
public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio 
stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of 
periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as 
disseminators of ``news'') who make their products available for 
purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not 
intended to be all-inclusive. Moreover, as traditional methods of news 
delivery evolve (e.g., electronic dissemination of newspapers through 
telecommunications services), such alternative media would be included 
in this category. In the case of ``freelance'' journalists, they may be 
regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a 
solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even 
though not actually employed by it. A publication contract would be the 
clearest proof, but NSF may also look to the past publication record of 
a requester in making this determination.

<R05>
Sec. 612.10  Fees to be charged--general.

    NSF shall charge fees that recoup the full allowable direct costs 
they incur. Moreover, NSF shall use the most efficient and least costly 
methods to comply with requests for documents made under the FOIA. NSF 
will contract with private sector services to locate, reproduce and 
disseminate records in response to FOIA requests when that is the most 
efficient and least costly method. When doing so, however, NSF shall 
ensure that the ultimate cost to the requester is no greater than it 
would be if NSF itself had performed these tasks. In no case will NSF 
contract out responsibilities which the FOIA provides that it alone may 
discharge, such as determining the applicability of an exemption, or 
determining whether to waive or reduce fees. In addition, NSF shall 
ensure that when documents that would be responsive to a request are 
maintained for distribution by agencies operating statutory-based fee 
schedule programs (see definition in Sec. 612.9(b), such as the NTIS, 
they inform requesters of the steps necessary to obtain records from 
those sources.
    (a) Manual searches for records. Whenever feasible, NSF shall charge 
at the salary rate(s) (i.e., basic pay plus 16 percent) of the 
employee(s) making the search. However, where a homogeneous class of 
personnel is used exclusively (e.g., all administrative/clerical, or all 
professional/executive), NSF may establish an average rate for the range 
of grades typically involved. Thus, for each one-quarter hour after the 
first quarter hour, for search of a record by clerical personnel, the 
charge is $2.50. For a nonroutine, nonclerical search by professional 
personnel, for example, where the task of determining which records fall 
within a request and search requires professional or managerial time, 
the charge is $7.50 for each one

[[Page 130]]

quarter hour spent in excess of the first quarter hour.
    (b) Computer searches for records. NSF shall charge at the actual 
direct cost of providing the service. This will include the cost of 
operating the central processing unit (CPU) for that portion of 
operating time that is directly attributable to searching for records 
responsive to a FOIA request and operator/programmer salary 
apportionable to the search. When NSF can establish a reasonable agency-
wide average rate for CPU operating costs and operator/programmer 
salaries involved in FOIA searches, the Foundation will do so and charge 
accordingly.
    (c) Review of records. Only requesters who are seeking documents for 
commercial use may be charged for time NSF spends reviewing records to 
determine whether they are exempt from mandatory disclosure. It should 
be noted that charges may be assessed only for the initial review; i.e., 
the review undertaken the first time NSF analyzes the applicability of a 
specific exemption to a particular record or portion of a record. NSF 
may not charge for review at the administrative appeal level of an 
exemption already applied. However, records or portions of records 
withheld in full under an exemption which is subsequently determined not 
to apply may be reviewed again to determine the applicability of other 
exemptions not previously considered. The costs for such a subsequent 
review would be properly assessable. Where a single class of reviewers 
is typically involved in the review process, NSF may establish a 
reasonable agency-wide average and charge accordingly.
    (d) Duplication of records. NSF shall establish an average agency-
wide, per-page charge for paper copy reproduction of documents. This 
charge shall represent the reasonable direct costs of making such 
copies, taking into account the salary of the operators as well as the 
cost of the reproduction machinery. For copies prepared by computer, 
such as tapes or printouts, NSF shall charge the actual cost, including 
operator time, of production of the tape or printout. For other methods 
of reproduction or duplication, NSF shall charge the actual direct costs 
of producing the document(s). For photocopies of documents, $0.25 per 
copy per page will be charged. In practice, if NSF estimates that 
duplication charges are likely to exceed $25, it shall notify the 
requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has 
indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as those 
anticipated. Such a notice shall offer a requester the opportunity to 
confer with agency personnel with the object of reformulating the 
request to meet his or her needs at a lower cost.
    (e) Other charges. It should be noted that complying with requests 
for special services such as those listed below is entirely at the 
discretion of NSF. Neither the FOIA nor its fee structure cover these 
kinds of services. NSF shall recover the full costs of providing 
services such as those enumerated below to the extent that it elects to 
provide them:
    (1) Certifying that records are true copies;
    (2) Sending records by special methods such as express mail.
    (f) Restrictions on assessing fees. With the exception of requesters 
seeking documents for a commercial use, section (4)(A)(iv) of the 
Freedom of Information Act, as amended, requires NSF to provide the 
first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time 
without charge. Moreover, this section prohibits NSF from charging fees 
to any requester, including commercial use requesters, if the cost of 
collecting a fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself. These 
provisions work together, so that except for commercial use requesters, 
NSF would not begin to assess fees until after they had provided the 
free search and reproduction. For example, for a request that involved 
two hours and ten minutes of search time and resulted in 105 pages of 
documents, NSF will determine the cost of only 10 minutes of search time 
and only five pages of reproduction. If this cost was equal to or less 
that the cost to the agency of billing the requester and processing the 
fee collected, no charges would result.

The elements to be considered in determining the ``cost of collecting a 
fee,'' are the administrative costs to the

[[Page 131]]

NSF of receiving and recording a requester's remittance, and processing 
the fee for deposit in the Treasury Department's special account (or the 
NSF's account if the agency is permitted to retain the fee). The per-
transaction cost to the Treasury to handle such remittances is 
negligible and shall not be considered in the NSF's determination. For 
purposes of these restrictions on assessment of fees, the word ``pages'' 
refers to paper copies of a standard agency size which will normally be 
``8\1/2\ x 11'' or ``11 by 14.'' Thus, requesters would not be entitled 
to 100 microfiche or 100 computer disks, for example. A microfiche 
containing the equivalent of 100 pages or 100 pages of computer 
printout, however, might meet the terms of the restriction. Similarly, 
the term ``search time'' in this context has as its basis manual search. 
To apply this term to searches made by computer, NSF shall determine the 
hourly cost of operating the central processing unit and the operator's 
hourly salary plus 16 percent. When the cost of the search (including 
the operator time and the cost of operating the computer to process a 
request) equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hours of the salary 
of the person performing the search, i.e., the operator, NSF shall begin 
assessing charges for computer search.

<R05>
Sec. 612.11  Fees to be charged--categories of requesters.

    There are four categories of FOIA requesters: Commercial use 
requesters; educational and non-commercial scientific institutions; 
representatives of the news media; and all other requesters. The Act 
prescribes specific levels of fees for each of these categories:
    (a) Commercial use requesters. When a request for documents for 
commercial use is received, NSF shall assess charges which recover the 
full direct cost of searching for, reviewing for release, and 
duplicating the records sought. Requesters must reasonably describe the 
records sought. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to two hours 
of free search time nor 100 free pages of reproduction of documents. NSF 
may recover the cost of searching for and reviewing records even if 
there is ultimately no disclosure of records (see Sec. 612.12(b) of this 
part).
    (b) Educational and non-commercial scientific institution 
requesters. NSF shall provide documents to requesters in this category 
for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 
pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must 
show that the request is being made as authorized by and under the 
auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought 
for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the 
request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the 
request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research. 
Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.
    (c) Requesters who are representatives of the news media. NSF shall 
provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of 
reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be 
eligible for inclusion in this category a requester must meet the 
criteria in Sec. 612.9(j) of this part, and his request must not be made 
for a commercial use. In reference to this class of requester, a request 
for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester 
shall not be considered to be a request that is for commercial use. 
Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.
    (d) All other requesters. NSF shall charge requesters who do not fit 
into any of the categories above fees which recover the full reasonable 
direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive 
to the request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the 
first two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge. 
Moreover, requests from record subjects for records about themselves 
filed in NSF's systems of records will continue to be treated under the 
fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 which permit fees only for 
reproduction. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.

<R05>
Sec. 612.12  Administrative actions to improve assessment and collection of fees.

    NSF shall ensure that procedures for assessing and collecting fees 
are applied consistently and uniformly by all components. To do so, NSF 
amends its FOIA regulations to conform to the provisions of this Fee 
Schedule and Guidelines, especially including the following elements:
    (a) Charging interest--notice and rate. NSF may begin assessing 
interest charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following 
the day on which the billing was sent. NSF shall ensure that their 
accounting procedures are adequate to properly credit a requester who 
has remitted the full amount within the time period. The fact that the 
fee has been received by the agency, even if not processed, will suffice 
to stay the accrual of interest. Interest will be at the rate prescribed 
in section 3717 of Title 31 U.S.C. and will accrue from the date of the 
billing.
    (b) Charges for unsuccessful search. NSF may assess charges for time 
spent searching, even if NSF fails to locate the records or if records 
located are determined to be exempt from disclosure. In practice, if NSF 
estimates that search charges are likely to exceed $25, it shall notify 
the requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has 
indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as those 
anticipated. Such a notice shall offer the requester the opportunity to 
confer with agency personnel with the object of reformulating the 
request to meet his or her needs at a lower cost.
    (c) Aggregating requests. Except for requests that are for a 
commercial use, NSF shall not charge for the first two hours of search 
time or for the first 100 pages of reproduction. However, a requester 
may not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions 
of a document or documents, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. 
When NSF reasonably believes that a requester or, on rare occasions, a 
group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break a request 
down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment 
of fees, NSF may aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly. One 
element to be considered in determining whether a belief would be 
reasonable is the time period in which the requests have occurred. For 
example, it would be reasonable to presume that multiple requests of 
this type made within a relatively short period had been made to avoid 
fees. For requests made over a longer period, however, such a 
presumption becomes harder to sustain and NSF should have a basis for 
determining that aggregation is warranted in such cases.
    (d) Advance payments. NSF shall not require a requester to make an 
advance payment, i.e., payment before work is commenced or continued on 
a request, unless:
    (1) The NSF estimates or determines that allowable charges that a 
requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250. Then, NSF 
should notify the requester of the likely cost and obtain satisfactory 
assurance of full payment where the requester has a history of prompt 
payment of FOIA fees, or require an advance payment of an amount up to 
the full estimated charges in the case of requesters with no history of 
payment; or
    (2) A requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a 
timely fashion (i.e. within 30 days of the date of the billing), NSF may 
require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable 
interest as provided above or demonstrate that he has, in fact, paid the 
fee, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated 
fee before the NSF begins to process a new request or a pending request 
from that requester.
    (e) When NSF acts under paragraph (d) (1) or (2) of this section, 
the administrative time limits prescribed in subsection (a)(6) of the 
FOIA (i.e., 10 working days from receipt of initial requests and 20 
working days from receipt of appeals from initial denial, plus 
permissible extensions of these time limits) will begin only after NSF 
has received fee payments described above.

Sec. 612.13  Waivers or reductions.

    (a) Employees of the National Science Foundation are encouraged to 
waive fees whenever the statutory fee

[[Page 133]]

waiver standard is met. However, employees are expected to respect the 
balance drawn in the statute, safeguarding federal funds by granting 
waivers or reductions only where it is determined that the following 
statutory standard is satisfied:

    Documents shall be furnished without any charge or at a charge 
reduced below the fees established under clause (ii) if disclosure of 
the information is in the public interest because it is likely to 
contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or 
activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial 
interest of the requester.

    (b) NSF will employ the following six factors in determining when 
FOIA fees should be waived or reduced:
    (1) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested 
records concerns ``the operations or activities of the government'';
    (2) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: 
whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding 
of government operations or activities;
    (3) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the 
general public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of 
the requested information will contribute to ``public understanding'';
    (4) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: 
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to 
public understanding of government operations or activities;
    (5) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether 
the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the 
requested disclosure; and, if so
    (6) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of the 
identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, 
in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is 
``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.''
    (c) NSF will use U.S. Department of Justice policy guidance in 
applying the foregoing factors.

<R05>
Sec. 613.1  Purpose and scope.

    This part sets forth the National Science Foundation procedures 
under the Privacy Act of 1974 as required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(f). Internal 
guidance for NSF staff and other regulations implementing the Privacy 
Act are contained or will be contained in NSF Circulars.


<R05>
Sec. 613.2  Procedures for notification of existence of records pertaining to individuals.

    (a) The systems of records, as defined in the Privacy Act of 1974, 
maintained by the National Science Foundation are listed annually in the 
Federal Register as required by that Act. Any person who wishes to know 
whether a system of records contains a record pertaining to him may 
either appear in person at the NSF Division of Administrative Services 
at 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA, on work days between the hours 
of 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. or may write to the NSF Privacy Act Officer, 
Division of Contracts, Policy, and Oversight, National Science 
Foundation, 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22230, it is 
recommended that requests be made in writing, since in many cases it 
will take several days to ascertain whether a record exists.
    (b) Requests for notification of the existence of a record should 
specifically identify the system of records involved and should state, 
if the requester is other than the individual to whom the record 
pertains, the relationship of the requester to that individual. (Note 
that requests will not be honored

[[Page 134]]

by the Foundation pursuant to the Privacy Act unless made (1) by the 
individual to whom the record pertains, (2) by such individual's parent 
if the individual is a minor, or (3) by such individual's legal guardian 
if the individual has been declared to be incompetent due to physical or 
mental incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction). In cases 
where the NSF Notice of the System appearing in the Federal Register 
states that the system location is decentralized the special instruction 
in such notice pertaining to ``Notification'' and ``Access'' and 
``Content'' must be followed.
    (c) The Foundation will attempt to respond to a request as to 
whether a record exists within 10 working days from the time it receives 
the request or from the time any required identification is established, 
whichever is later.

[40 FR 44510, Sept. 26, 1975, as amended at 49 FR 37595, Sept. 25, 1984; 
59 FR 37438, July 22, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 613.3  Procedures for requests for access to or disclosure of records pertaining to an individual.

    (a) Any person may request review of records pertaining to him by 
appearing at the NSF Division of Administrative Services at 4201 Wilson 
Boulevard, Arlington, VA on work days between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 
5 p.m. or by writing to the NSF Privacy Act Officer, Division of 
Contracts, Policy, and Oversight, National Science Foundation, 4201 
Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22230. (See paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section, for identification requirements.) The request should 
specifically identify the systems of records involved, and the request 
should include any special information specified in the notice of the 
system under ``Notification'' and ``Access and Contest.'' The Foundation 
will strive either to make the record available within 15 working days 
of the request or to inform the requester of the need for additional 
identification or the tendering of fees (as specified in Sec. 613.4(e)) 
within 15 working days; except that if the request for access was not 
preceded by a notification request as provided in Sec. 613.2, then the 
15-day period shall not begin until after such time as it has been 
determined that the record exists.
    (b) In the case of persons making requests by appearing at the 
Foundation the amount of personal identification required will of 
necessity vary with the sensitivity of the record involved. Except as 
indicated below reasonable identification such as employment 
identification cards, drivers licenses, credit cards will normally be 
accepted as sufficient evidence of identity in the absence of any 
indications to the contrary. Records in the following systems of 
records, however, are considered to contain relatively sensitive and/or 
detailed personal information--

Accident and Injury Reports (Antarctic)
Alien Applications for Consideration of Waiver of Two-Year Foreign 
Residence Requirements

Accordingly, with respect to requests for records in these systems the 
Foundation reserves the right to require sufficient identification to 
identify positively the individual making the request. This might 
involve independent verification by the Foundation as by phone calls to 
determine whether an individual has made a request, personal 
identification by Foundation employees who know the individual, or such 
other means as are considered appropriate under the circumstances.
    (c) A written request will be honored only if it contains the 
following certification before a duly commissioned notary public of any 
state or territory (or similar official if the request is made outside 
the United States):

    I, ________________________, do hereby certify that I am the 
individual about whom the record requested in this letter pertains or 
that I am within the class of persons authorized to act on his behalf in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(h).

          ______________________________________________________________
                                                            (Date)      
    (S) My commission expires ____________.


However, where the record requested is contained in any of the systems 
of records listed in paragraph (b) of this section, the Foundation 
reserves the right to require additional identification and/or to 
independently verify to its satisfaction the identity of the requester.
    (d) Charges for copies of records will be at the rate of $0.10 per 
photocopy of each page. Where records are not susceptible to photo-
copying, e.g., punch cards, magnetic tapes or oversize materials, the 
amount charged will be actual cost as determined on a case-by-case 
basis. Only one copy of each record requested will be supplied. No 
charge will be made unless the charge as computed above would exceed 
$3.00 for each request or related series of requests. If a fee in excess 
of $25.00 would be required, the requester shall be notified and the fee 
must be tendered before the records will be copied.
    (e) The procedures of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section 
shall also apply to requests made pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) that 
accountings made under 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(1) be made available.

<R05>
Sec. 613.4  Correction of records.

    (a) Any individual is entitled to request amendments of records 
pertaining to him pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2). Such a request shall 
be made in writing and addressed to the NSF Privacy Act Officer, 
Division of Contracts, Policy, and Oversight, National Science 
Foundation, 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22230.
    (b) The request should specify the record and systems of records 
involved, and should specify the exact correction desired and state that 
the request is made pursuant to the Privacy Act. An edited copy of the 
record showing the desired correction is desirable. Within 10 working 
days of the receipt of a properly addressed request (or within 10 
working days of the time the Privacy Act Officer becomes aware that a 
particular communication not addressed as prescribed above is a request 
for correction of a record under the Privacy Act), the Privacy Act 
Officer shall acknowledge receipt of the request.
    (c) The Privacy Act Officer upon the receipt of such a request shall 
promptly confer with the Directorate or office within the NSF 
responsible for the record. If the Privacy Act Officer finds that 
correction is not warranted in whole or in part, the matter shall be

[[Page 136]]

brought to the attention of the Inspector General, if it pertains to 
records maintained by the Office of Inspector General, or to the 
attention of the General Counsel, if it pertains to other records. If, 
after review by the General Counsel or by the Inspector General and 
discussion with the requester if deemed helpful, it is determined that 
correction as requested is not warranted, a letter shall be sent by the 
Privacy Act Officer to the requester denying his request and/or 
explaining what correction might be made if agreeable to the requester. 
This letter shall set forth the reasons for the refusal to honor the 
request for correction. It shall also inform him of his right to appeal 
this decision and include a description of the appeals procedure set 
forth in paragraph (d) of this section. Such letter or notification that 
the desired correction will be made shall normally be sent within 30 
working days of the receipt of a properly addressed request (or within 
30 working days of the time the Privacy Act Officer becomes aware that a 
particular communication not addressed as prescribed above is a request 
for correction of a record under the Privacy Act).
    (d) An appeal may be taken from an adverse determination under 
paragraph (c) of this section, to the Deputy Director of the Foundation. 
Such appeal must be made in writing and should clearly indicate that it 
is an appeal. The basis for the appeal should be included, and it should 
be mailed to the same address as listed in paragraph (a) of this 
section. A hearing at the Foundation may be requested. Such hearing will 
be informal, and shall be before the Deputy Director or his designee. If 
no hearing is requested, the request for appeal should include the basis 
for the appeal. Where no hearing is requested the Deputy Director shall 
render his decision within thirty working days after receipt of the 
written appeal at the Foundation unless the Director, for good cause 
shown, extends the 30-day period and the appellant is advised in writing 
of such extension. If a hearing is requested, then the Foundation will 
attempt to contact the appellant within five working days and arrange a 
suitable time for the hearing. In such case the decision of the Deputy 
Director shall be made within 30 working days after the hearing unless 
the time is extended and the appellant is advised in writing of such 
extension.
    (e) The final decision of the Deputy Director in an appeal shall be 
in writing and, if adverse to the appellant, set forth the reasons for 
the refusal to amend the record and advise him of his right to appeal 
the decision under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(A). The individual shall also be 
notified that he has the right to file with the Foundation a concise 
statement setting forth the reasons for his disagreement with the 
refusal of the Foundation to amend his record.

Sec. 614.1  General rule.

    Except as otherwise provided in these regulations, every portion of 
every meeting of the National Science Board will be open to public 
observation.


<R05>
Sec. 614.2  Grounds for closing meetings.

    (a) The National Science Board may by record vote close any portion 
of any meeting if it properly determines that an open meeting:
    (1) Is likely to disclose matters that (i) are specifically 
authorized under criteria established by Executive Order to be kept 
secret in the interests of national defense or foreign policy and (ii) 
are in fact properly classified pursuant to the Executive Order;
    (2) Is likely to relate solely to the internal personnel rules and 
practices of the National Science Foundation;
    (3) Is likely to disclose matters specifically exempted from 
disclosure by statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552): Provided, That the 
statute (i) requires in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the 
issue that the matters be withheld from the public, or (ii) establishes 
particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of 
matters to be withheld;
    (4) Is likely to disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial 
information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;
    (5) Is likely to involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally 
censuring any person;
    (6) Is likely to disclose personal information where the disclosure 
would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
    (7) Is likely to disclose investigatory law-enforcement records, or 
information which, if written, would be contained in such records, but 
only to the extent provided in 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(7);
    (8) Is likely to disclose information contained in or related to 
examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, 
or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or 
supervision of financial institutions;

[[Page 138]]

    (9) Is likely to disclose information, the premature disclosure of 
which would:
    (i) In the case of information received from an agency which 
regulates currencies, securities, commodities, or financial 
institutions, be likely to (A) lead to significant financial speculation 
in currencies, securities, or commodities, or (B) significantly endanger 
the stability of any financial institution; or
    (ii) Be likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a 
proposed Foundation action, unless the Foundation has already disclosed 
to the public the content or nature of its proposed action or is 
required by law to make such disclosure on its own initiative before 
taking final action; or
    (10) Is likely to specifically concern the Foundation's 
participation in a civil action or proceeding, an action in a foreign 
court or international tribunal, or an arbitration.
    (b) Anyone who believes his interests may be directly affected by a 
portion of a meeting may request that the Board close it to the public 
for any reason referred to in paragraph (a) (5), (6), or (7) of this 
section. The request should be addressed to the Executive Officer, 
National Science Board, National Science Foundation, 4201 Wilson 
Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22230. It will be circulated to Members of the 
Board if received at least three full days before the meeting, and on 
motion of any Member the Board will determine by record vote whether to 
close the affected portion of the meeting.

[42 FR 14719, Mar. 16, 1977, as amended at 59 FR 37438, July 22, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 614.3  Materials relating to closed portions of meetings.

    If a portion or portions of any meeting of the National Science 
Board are closed to the public under Sec. 614.2:
    (a) The General Counsel of the National Science Foundation shall 
publicly certify that, in his opinion, that portion or portions may 
properly be closed to the public. The certificate shall state the 
exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552b(c) that make the closings proper.
    (b) The presiding officer of the meeting (usually the Chairman of 
the Board) shall furnish a statement setting forth the time and place of 
the meeting and the persons present.
    (c) The Board shall make a complete transcript or electronic 
recording adequate to record fully the proceedings of each portion of 
the meeting that is closed to the public.
    (d) The National Science Board Office shall maintain the General 
Counsel's certificate, the presiding officer's statement, and the 
transcript or recording of the meeting for at least two years after the 
meeting and at least one year after the Board completes consideration of 
any proposal, report, resolution, or similar matter discussed in any 
closed portion of the meeting.


<R05>
Sec. 614.4  Opening of transcript or recording.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the transcript or 
electronic recording of every portion of every meeting closed to the 
public will promptly be made available on request to any member of the 
public in an easily accessible place.
    (b) Informal requests to inspect or copy the transcript or 
electronic recording of a closed session may be made to the staff of the 
National Science Board and will be handled informally and expeditiously. 
Written requests to inspect or copy such a transcript or recording that 
cite the Freedom of Information Act or the Sunshine Act will be treated 
as formal requests made under the Freedom of Information Act. They will 
be handled under the Foundation's Freedom of Information procedures 
described in 45 CFR part 612. The exemptions of these Sunshine Act 
regulations, 45 CFR 614.2, will govern, however, in determining what 
portions of the transcript or recording may be withheld.
    (c) A request to inspect or copy a transcript or electronic 
recording should specify the date of the meeting and the agenda item or 
items to which the request pertains. It should contain a promise to pay 
the costs of any duplication requested.
    (d) No search or transcription fees will be charged. Duplication 
fees may be charged as provided in 45 CFR 612.6.

<R05>
Sec. 614.5  Public announcement.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, 
the National Science Board will make a public announcement of each Board 
meeting at least one week before the meeting takes place. The 
announcement will cover:
    (1) The time, place, and subject matter of the meeting;
    (2) What portions of the meeting, if any, are to be closed to the 
public; and
    (3) The name and telephone number of the official designated to 
respond to requests for information on the meeting.
    (b) Each such announcement will be promptly posted on public notice 
boards at the National Science Foundation and made available to journals 
of general scientific interest. Immediately following the issuance of 
such an announcement, it will be submitted for publication in the 
Federal Register.
    (c) The announcement may be made less than a week before the meeting 
it announces or after the meeting only if (1) the Board by record vote 
determines that agency business requires the meeting to be called on 
such short or after-the-fact notice and (2) an announcement is made at 
the earliest practicable time.
    (d) All or any portion of the announcement of any meeting may be 
omitted if the Board by record vote determines that the announcement 
would disclose information which should be withheld under the same 
standards as apply for closing meetings under Sec. 614.2.


<R05>
Sec. 614.6  Meeting changes.

    (a) The time or place of a meeting of the National Science Board 
that has been publicly announced as provided in Sec. 614.5 may 
subsequently be changed, but any such change will be publicly announced

Appendix I to Part 617--List of Age Distinctions Provided in Federal 
          Statutes or Regulations Affecting Federal Financial Assistance 
          Administered by NSF

    Authority:  Age Discrimination Act of 1975, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 
6101, et seq.; 45 CFR part 90.

    Source:  49 FR 49628, Dec. 21, 1984, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 617.1  Purpose.

    This part prescribes NSF's policies and procedures under the Age 
Discrimination Act of 1975 and the Department of Health and Human 
Services government-wide age discrimination regulations at 45 CFR part 
90. The Act and part 90 prohibit discrimination on the basis of age in 
programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance. The Act 
and part 90 permit federally assisted programs and activities and 
recipients of Federal funds to continue to use age distinctions and 
factors other than age which meet the requirements of the Act and part 
90.


<R05>
Sec. 617.2  Definitions.

    The following terms used in this part are defined in part 90:

Act
Action
Age
Age distinction
Age-related term
Agency
Federal financial assistance
Recipient (including subrecipients)
United States


<R05>
Sec. 617.3  Standards.

    Standards for determining whether an age distinction or age-related 
term is prohibited are set out in part 90 of this title 45. See also 
appendix I to this part.


<R05>
Sec. 617.4  General duties of recipients.

    Each recipient of Federal financial assistance from NSF shall comply 
with the Act, part 90, and this part. Each NSF award of Federal 
financial assistance shall contain the following provision:

                 Compliance With Age Discrimination Act

    The recipient agrees to comply with the Age Discrimination Act of 
1975 as implemented by the Department of Health and Human Services 
regulations at 45 CFR part 90 and the regulations of the Foundation at 
45 CFR part 617. In the event the recipient passes on NSF financial 
assistance to sub-recipients, this provision shall apply to the 
subrecipients, and the instrument under which the Federal financial 
assistance is passed to the subrecipient shall contain a provision 
identical to this provision.


<R05>
Sec. 617.5  Self-evaluation.

    (a) Each recipient (including subrecipients) employing the 
equivalent of fifteen or more full-time employees shall complete a 
written self-evaluation of its compliance under this part within 18 
months of the effective date of these regulations, unless a similar 
evaluation has been completed for another agency.
    (b) In its self-evaluation, each recipient shall identify all age 
distinctions it uses and justify each age distinction it imposes on the 
program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from NSF.

[[Page 143]]

    (c) Each recipient shall take corrective action whenever a self-
evaluation indicates a violation of the Act.
    (d) Each recipient shall make the self-evaluation available on 
request to NSF and the public for three years after its completion.


<R05>
Sec. 617.6  Information requirements.

    Each recipient shall:
    (a) Make available upon request to NSF information necessary to 
determine whether the recipient is complying with the Act.
    (b) Permit reasonable access by NSF or its designee to the books, 
records, accounts, and other recipient facilities and sources of 
information to the extent necessary to determine whether a recipient is 
complying with the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 617.7  Compliance reviews.

    (a) NSF may conduct compliance reviews of recipients that will 
permit it to investigate and correct violations of the Act. NSF may 
conduct these reviews even in the absence of a complaint against a 
recipient. The review may be as comprehensive as necessary to determine 
whether a violation of the Act has occurred.
    (b) If a compliance review indicates a violation of the Act, NSF 
will attempt to achieve voluntary compliance with the Act. If voluntary 
compliance cannot be achieved, NSF may arrange for enforcement as 
described in Sec. 617.12.


<R05>
Sec. 617.8  Pre-award reviews.

    NSF reserves the right to conduct pre-award reviews of applicants 
for Federal financial assistance from NSF in cases where the NSF has 
substantial reason to believe that a potential recipient who is not then 
a recipient of other NSF financial assistance under the same program or 
activities may engage in practices under that program or activity that 
would violate the Act. However, the results of any such review shall not 
constitute a basis for NSF refusal to grant financial assistance to the 
applicant under that program or activity unless the procedural 
requirements of the Act (42 U.S.C. 6104) and Secs. 617.12 and 617.13 of 
this part have been followed.


<R05>
Sec. 617.9  Complaints.

    (a) Any person, individually or as a member of a class or on behalf 
of others, may file a complaint with NSF, alleging discrimination 
prohibited by the Act. A complainant shall file a complaint within 180 
days from the date the complainant first had knowledge of the alleged 
act of discrimination. However, for good cause shown, NSF may extend 
this time limit.
    (b) NSF will accept as a sufficient complaint, any written statement 
which identifies the parties involved and the date the complainant first 
had knowledge of the alleged violation, describes generally the action 
or practice complained of, and is signed by the complainant. If an 
insufficient complaint is amended within 10 working days after notice by 
NSF to the complainant of the deficiency, NSF will consider the amended 
complaint as filed on the date the original insufficient complaint was 
filed for purposes of determining if it was timely filed. However, all 
other time requirements established by the Act and this part shall run 
from the date the amended complaint was filed.
    (c) On receipt of any complaint NSF shall promptly send written 
acknowledgement to the complainant, and a copy of the complaint to the 
recipient. In addition, NSF shall send either copies of this part or 
other pertinent information describing the rights and obligations of the 
parties.
    (d) NSF will return to the complainant any complaint outside the 
coverage of this part, and will state why it is outside the coverage of 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 617.10  Mediation.

    (a) NSF will refer to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service 
all complaints that fall within the jurisdiction of this part and 
contain all information necessary for further processing.
    (b) Both the complainant and the recipient shall participate in the 
mediation process to the extent necessary to reach an agreement or for a 
mediator to make an informed judgement that an agreement is not 
possible. NSF

[[Page 144]]

will take no further administrative action on any complaint if the 
complainant refuses to participate in the mediation process.
    (c) If the complainant and the recipient reach an agreement, the 
mediator shall prepare a written statement of the agreement and have the 
complainant and recipient sign it. The mediator shall send a copy of the 
agreement to NSF. NSF shall take no further action on the complaint 
unless the complainant or the recipient fails to comply with the 
agreement, in which case the other party may request that the complaint 
be reopened.
    (d) The mediator shall protect the confidentiality of all 
information obtained in the course of the mediation process. No mediator 
shall testify in any adjudicative proceeding, produce any document, or 
otherwise disclose any information obtained in the course of the 
mediation process without prior approval of the head of the Federal 
Mediation and Conciliation Service.
    (e) NSF will use the mediation process for a maximum of 60 days 
after receiving a complaint. Mediation ends if:
    (1) 60 days elapse from the time NSF receives a sufficient 
complaint: or
    (2) Before the end of the 60 day period, an agreement is reached; or
    (3) Before the end of the 60 day period, the mediator determines 
that an agreement cannot be reached.
    (f) The mediator shall return unresolved complaints to NSF.


<R05>
Sec. 617.11  Investigation.

    (a) Informal investigation. (1) NSF will investigate complaints that 
are unresolved after mediation or are reopened because of violation of a 
mediation agreement.
    (2) As part of the initial investigation, NSF will use informal fact 
finding methods, including joint or separate discussions with the 
complainant and recipient, to establish the facts, and, if possible, 
will settle the complaint on terms that are agreeable to the parties. 
NSF may seek the assistance of any involved State program agency.
    (3) NSF will put any agreement in writing and have it signed by the 
parties and an authorized official of NSF.
    (4) A settlement shall not affect other enforcement efforts of NSF, 
including compliance reviews, or individual complaints that involve the 
recipient.
    (5) A settlement is not a finding of discrimination against the 
recipient.
    (b) Formal investigation. If NSF cannot resolve the complaint 
through informal investigation, it will begin to develop formal findings 
through further investigation of the complaint. If the investigation 
indicates a violation of the Act, NSF will try to obtain voluntary 
compliance. If NSF cannot obtain voluntary compliance, it will begin 
enforcement as described in Sec. 617.12. If the investigation does not 
indicate a violation of the Act, NSF will issue a written determination 
in favor of the recipient.


<R05>
Sec. 617.12  Compliance procedure.

    (a) NSF may enforce this part by either termination of a recipient's 
financial asistance from NSF under the program or activity involved 
where the recipient has violated the Act or this part or refusal to 
grant further financial assistance under the program or activity 
involved where the recipient has violated the Act or this part. The 
determination of the recipient's violation may be made only after a 
recipient has had an opportunity for a hearing on the record before an 
administrative law judge. Therefore, cases settled in the mediation 
process or before a hearing will not involve termination of a 
recipient's Federal financial assistance from NSF.
    (b) NSF may also enforce this part by any other means authorized by 
law, including but not limited to:
    (1) Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce 
any rights of the United States or obligations by this part.
    (2) Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, State, or 
local government agency that will have the effect of correcting a 
violation of the Act or this part.
    (c) NSF will limit any termination or refusal to grant further 
financial assistance to the particular recipient and the particular 
program found to be in violation of the Act. NSF will not base any part 
of a termination or refusal on a finding with respect to any program or 
activity of the recipient which does

[[Page 145]]

not receive Federal financial assistance for NSF.
    (d) NSF will not begin any hearing under paragraph (a) until the 
Director has advised the recipient of its failure to comply with this 
part and has determined that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained.
    (e) NSF will not terminate or refuse to grant Federal financial 
assistance until thirty days have elapsed after the Director has sent a 
written report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the 
committees of the Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the 
Federal program or activity involved. The Director will file a report 
whenever any action is taken under paragraph (f) of this section.
    (f) Alternate Funds Disbursal Procedures. (1) When NSF withholds 
funds from a recipient under these regulations, the Secretary may 
disburse the withheld funds directly to an alternate recipient: Any 
public or non-profit private organization or agency, or State or 
political subdivision of the State.
    (2) The Director will require any alternate recipient to 
demonstrate:
    (i) The ability to comply with these regulations; and
    (ii) The ability to achieve the goals of the Federal statute 
authorizing the program or activity.


<R05>
Sec. 617.13  Hearings, decisions, post-termination proceedings.

    Procedures prescribed in 45 CFR 611.9 and 611.10 for NSF enforcement 
of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 shall apply also for NSF 
enforcement of this part. At the conclusion of any action taken under 
Sec. 617.12, NSF, shall remind both parties of the right to judicial 
review established by 42 U.S.C. 6105.


<R05>
Sec. 617.14  Remedial action by recipients.

    Where the Director finds that a recipient has discriminated on the 
basis of age, the recipient shall take any remedial action the Director 
may require to overcome the effects of the discrimination. If another 
recipient exercises control over the recipient that has discriminated, 
the Director may require both recipients to take remedial action.


<R05>
Sec. 617.15  Exhaustion of administrative remedies.

    (a) A complainant may file a civil action after exhausting 
administrative remedies under the Act. Administrative remedies are 
exhausted if:
    (1) 180 days have elapsed since the complainant filed a sufficient 
complaint and NSF has made no finding with regard to the complaint; or
    (2) NSF issues any finding in favor of the recipient.
    (b) If NSF fails to make a finding within 180 days or issues a 
finding in favor of the recipient, NSF will:
    (1) Promptly advise the complainant of this fact; and
    (2) Advise the complainant of his or her right to bring a civil 
action for injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. 6104; and
    (3) Inform the complainant that under 42 U.S.C. 6104:
    (i) The complainant may bring a civil action only in a United States 
District court for the district in which the recipient is located or 
transacts business;
    (ii) A complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right to be 
awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney's fees, 
but that the complainant must demand these costs in the complaint;
    (iii) Before commencing the action the complainant shall give 30 
days notice by registered mail to the Director, the Attorney General of 
the United States, and the recipient;
    (iv) The notice must state the alleged violation of the Act; the 
relief requested; the court in which the complainant is bringing the 
action; and whether or not attorney's fees are demanded in the event the 
complainant prevails; and
    (v) The complainant may not bring an action if the same alleged 
violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending 
action in any court of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 617.16  Prohibition against intimidation or retaliation.

    A recipient may not engage in acts of intimidation or retaliation 
against a person who:
    (a) Attempts to assert a right protected by the Act, or
    (b) Cooperates in any mediation, investigation, hearing or other 
part of

[[Page 146]]

NSF's investigation, conciliation, and enforcement process.

<R05>
Sec. 620.100  Purpose.

    (a) Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 provides that, to the extent 
permitted by law, Executive departments and agencies shall participate 
in a governmentwide system for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. 
A person who is debarred or suspended shall be excluded

[[Page 147]]

from Federal financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under 
Federal programs and activities. Debarment or suspension of a 
participant in a program by one agency shall have governmentwide effect.
    (b) These regulations implement section 3 of E.O. 12549 and the 
guidelines promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget under 
section 6 of the E.O. by:
    (1) Prescribing the programs and activities that are covered by the 
governmentwide system;
    (2) Prescribing the governmentwide criteria and governmentwide 
minimum due process procedures that each agency shall use;
    (3) Providing for the listing of debarred and suspended 
participants, participants declared ineligible (see definition of 
``ineligible'' in Sec. 620.105), and participants who have voluntarily 
excluded themselves from participation in covered transactions;
    (4) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, 
determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion; and
    (5) Offering such other guidance as necessary for the effective 
implementation and administration of the governmentwide system.
    (c) These regulations also implement Executive Order 12689 (3 CFR, 
1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Public Law 103-355, sec. 
2455, 108 Stat. 3327) by--
    (1) Providing for the inclusion in the List of Parties Excluded from 
Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs all persons proposed for 
debarment, debarred or suspended under the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation, 48 CFR Part 9, subpart 9.4; persons against which 
governmentwide exclusions have been entered under this part; and persons 
determined to be ineligible; and
    (2) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, 
determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion.
    (d) Although these regulations cover the listing of ineligible 
participants and the effect of such listing, they do not prescribe 
policies and procedures governing declarations of ineligibility.

<R05>
Sec. 620.110  Coverage.

    (a) These regulations apply to all persons who have participated, 
are currently participating or may reasonably be expected to participate 
in transactions under Federal nonprocurement programs. For purposes of 
these regulations such transactions will be referred to as ``covered 
transactions.''
    (1) Covered transaction. For purposes of these regulations, a 
covered transaction is a primary covered transaction or a lower tier 
covered transaction. Covered transactions at any tier need not involve 
the transfer of Federal funds.
    (i) Primary covered transaction. Except as noted in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section, a primary covered transaction is any nonprocurement 
transaction between an agency and a person, regardless of type, 
including: grants, cooperative agreements, scholarships, fellowships, 
contracts of assistance, loans, loan guarantees, subsidies, insurance, 
payments for specified use, donation agreements and any other 
nonprocurement transactions between a Federal agency and a person. 
Primary covered transactions also include those transactions specially 
designated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in 
such agency's regulations governing debarment and suspension.
    (ii) Lower tier covered transaction. A lower tier covered 
transaction is:
    (A) Any transaction between a participant and a person other than a 
procurement contract for goods or services, regardless of type, under a 
primary covered transaction.
    (B) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a 
participant and a person, regardless of type, expected to equal or 
exceed the Federal procurement small purchase threshold fixed at 10 
U.S.C. 2304(g) and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) (currently $25,000) under a primary 
covered transaction.
    (C) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a 
participant and a person under a covered transaction, regardless of 
amount, under which that person will have a critical influence on or 
substantive control over that covered transaction. Such persons are:
    (1) Principal investigators.
    (2) Providers of federally-required audit services.
    (2) Exceptions. The following transactions are not covered:
    (i) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier 
awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including 
deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;
    (ii) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international 
organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign 
government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, entities 
consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities;
    (iii) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without 
regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received 
in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);
    (iv) Federal employment;
    (v) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized 
emergencies or disasters;
    (vi) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental 
operations; and
    (vii) Other transactions where the application of these regulations 
would be prohibited by law.
    (b) Relationship to other sections. This section describes the types 
of transactions to which a debarment or suspension under the regulations 
will

[[Page 150]]

apply. Subpart B, ``Effect of Action,'' Sec. 620.200, ``Debarment or 
suspension,'' sets forth the consequences of a debarment or suspension. 
Those consequences would obtain only with respect to participants and 
principals in the covered transactions and activities described in 
Sec. 620.110(a). Sections 620.325, ``Scope of debarment,'' and 620.420, 
``Scope of suspension,'' govern the extent to which a specific 
participant or organizational elements of a participant would be 
automatically included within a debarment or suspension action, and the 
conditions under which affiliates or persons associated with a 
participant may also be brought within the scope of the action.
    (c) Relationship to Federal procurement activities. In accordance 
with E.O. 12689 and section 2455 of Public Law 103-355, any debarment, 
suspension, proposed debarment or other governmentwide exclusion 
initiated under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) on or after 
August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for Executive 
Branch agencies and participants as an exclusion under this regulation. 
Similarly, any debarment, suspension or other governmentwide exclusion 
initiated under this regulation on or after August 25, 1995 shall be 
recognized by and effective for those agencies as a debarment or 
suspension under the FAR.

<R05>
Sec. 620.115  Policy.

    (a) In order to protect the public interest, it is the policy of the 
Federal Government to conduct business only with responsible persons. 
Debarment and suspension are discretionary actions that, taken in 
accordance with Executive Order 12549 and these regulations, are 
appropriate means to implement this policy.
    (b) Debarment and suspension are serious actions which shall be used 
only in the public interest and for the Federal Government's protection 
and not for purposes of punishment. Agencies may impose debarment or 
suspension for the causes and in accordance with the procedures set 
forth in these regulations.
    (c) When more than one agency has an interest in the proposed 
debarment or suspension of a person, consideration shall be given to 
designating one agency as the lead agency for making the decision. 
Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for 
coordinating their debarment or suspension actions.

    (a) Primary covered transactions. Except to the extent prohibited by 
law, persons who are debarred or suspended shall be excluded from 
primary covered transactions as either participants or principals 
throughout the Executive Branch of the Federal Government for the period 
of their debarment, suspension, or the period they are proposed for 
debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4. Accordingly, no agency shall 
enter into primary covered transactions with such excluded persons 
during such period, except as permitted pursuant to Sec. 620.215.
    (b) Lower tier covered transactions. Except to the extent prohibited 
by law, persons who have been proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 
9, subpart 9.4, debarred or suspended shall be excluded from 
participating as either participants or principals in all lower tier 
covered transactions (see Sec. 620.110(a)(1)(ii)) for the period of 
their exclusion.
    (c) Exceptions. Debarment or suspension does not affect a person's 
eligibility for--
    (1) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier 
awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including 
deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;
    (2) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international 
organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign 
government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, and 
entities consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or 
foreign governmental entities;
    (3) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without 
regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received 
in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);

    (5) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized 
emergencies or disasters;
    (6) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental 
operations; and

<R05>
Sec. 620.205  Ineligible persons.

    Persons who are ineligible, as defined in Sec. 620.105(i), are 
excluded in accordance with the applicable statutory, executive order, 
or regulatory authority.


<R05>
Sec. 620.210  Voluntary exclusion.

    Persons who accept voluntary exclusions under Sec. 620.315 are 
excluded in accordance with the terms of their settlements. NSF shall, 
and participants may, contact the original action agency to ascertain 
the extent of the exclusion.


<R05>
Sec. 620.215  Exception provision.

    NSF may grant an exception permitting a debarred, suspended, or 
voluntarily excluded person, or a person proposed for debarment under 48 
CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, to participate in a particular covered 
transaction upon a written determination by the agency head or an 
authorized designee stating the reason(s) for deviating from the 
Presidential policy established by Executive Order 12549 and 
Sec. 620.200. However, in accordance with the President's stated 
intention in the Executive Order, exceptions shall be granted only 
infrequently. Exceptions shall be reported in accordance with 
Sec. 620.505(a).

[60 FR 33041, 33062, June 26, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 620.220  Continuation of covered transactions.

    (a) Notwithstanding the debarment, suspension, proposed debarment 
under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, determination of ineligibility, or 
voluntary exclusion of any person by an agency, agencies and 
participants may continue covered transactions in existence at the time 
the person was debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR 
part 9, subpart 9.4, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded. A 
decision as to the type of termination action, if any, to be taken 
should be made only after thorough review to ensure the propriety of the 
proposed action.
    (b) Agencies and participants shall not renew or extend covered 
transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any person who is 
debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 
9.4, ineligible or voluntary excluded, except as provided in 
Sec. 620.215.

[60 FR 33041, 33062, June 26, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 620.225  Failure to adhere to restrictions.

    (a) Except as permitted under Sec. 620.215 or Sec. 620.220, a 
participant shall not knowingly do business under a covered transaction 
with a person who is--
    (1) Debarred or suspended;
    (2) Proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; or
    (3) Ineligible for or voluntarily excluded from the covered 
transaction.
    (b) Violation of the restriction under paragraph (a) of this section 
may result in disallowance of costs, annulment or termination of award, 
issuance of a stop work order, debarment or suspension, or other 
remedies as appropriate.
    (c) A participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective 
participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it and its 
principals are not debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 
CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the 
covered transaction (See Appendix B of these regulations), unless it 
knows that the certification is erroneous. An agency has the burden of 
proof that a participant did knowingly do business with a person that 
filed an erroneous certification.

                          Subpart C--Debarment


<R05>
Sec. 620.300  General.

    The debarring official may debar a person for any of the causes in 
Sec. 620.305, using procedures established in Secs. 620.310 through 
620.314. The existence of a cause for debarment, however, does not 
necessarily require that the person

[[Page 152]]

be debarred; the seriousness of the person's acts or omissions and any 
mitigating factors shall be considered in making any debarment decision.


<R05>
Sec. 620.305  Causes for debarment.

    Debarment may be imposed in accordance with the provisions of 
Secs. 620.300 through 620.314 for:

integrity or business honesty that seriously and directly affects the 
present responsibility of a person.
    (b) Violation of the terms of a public agreement or transaction so 
serious as to affect the integrity of an agency program, such as:
    (1) A willful failure to perform in accordance with the terms of one

    (2) A history of failure to perform or of unsatisfactory performance 
of one or more public agreements or transactions; or
    (3) A willful violation of a statutory or regulatory provision or 
requirement applicable to a public agreement or transaction.
    (c) Any of the following causes:
    (1) A nonprocurement debarment by any Federal agency taken before 
October 1, 1988, the effective date of these regulations, or a 
procurement debarment by any Federal agency taken pursuant to 48 CFR 
subpart 9.4;
    (2) Knowingly doing business with a debarred, suspended, ineligible, 
or voluntarily excluded person, in connection with a covered 
transaction, except as permitted in Sec. 620.215 or Sec. 620.220;

debtor's legal and administrative remedies have been exhausted;
    (4) Violation of a material provision of a voluntary exclusion 
agreement entered into under Sec. 620.315 or of any settlement of a 
debarment or suspension action; or

<R05>
Sec. 620.310  Procedures.

    NSF shall process debarment actions as informally as practicable, 
consistent with the principles of fundamental fairness, using the 
procedures in Secs. 620.311 through 620.314.


<R05>
Sec. 620.311  Investigation and referral.

    Information concerning the existence of a cause for debarment from 
any source shall be promptly reported, investigated, and referred, when 
appropriate, to the debarring official for consideration. After 
consideration, the debarring official may issue a notice of proposed 
debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 620.312  Notice of proposed debarment.

    A debarment proceeding shall be initiated by notice to the 
respondent advising:
    (a) That debarment is being considered;
    (b) Of the reasons for the proposed debarment in terms sufficient to 
put the respondent on notice of the conduct or transaction(s) upon which 
it is based;
    (c) Of the cause(s) relied upon under Sec. 620.305 for proposing 
debarment;
    (d) Of the provisions of Sec. 620.311 through Sec. 620.314, and any 
other NSF

[[Page 153]]

procedures, if applicable, governing debarment decisionmaking; and
    (e) Of the potential effect of a debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 620.313  Opportunity to contest proposed debarment.

    (a) Submission in opposition. Within 30 days after receipt of the 
notice of proposed debarment, the respondent may submit, in person, in 
writing, or through a representative, information and argument in 
opposition to the proposed debarment.
    (b) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. (1) In 
actions not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, if the debarring 
official finds that the respondent's submission in opposition raises a 
genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment, 
respondent(s) shall be afforded an opportunity to appear with a 
representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and 
confront any witness the agency presents.
    (2) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be made 
available at cost to the respondent, upon request, unless the respondent 
and the agency, by mutual agreement, waive the requirement for a 
transcript.


<R05>
Sec. 620.314  Debarring official's decision.

    (a) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions based upon a 
conviction or civil judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute 
over material facts, the debarring official shall make a decision on the 
basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any 
submission made by the respondent. The decision shall be made within 45 
days after receipt of any information and argument submitted by the 
respondent, unless the debarring official extends this period for good 
cause.
    (b) Additional proceedings necessary. (1) In actions in which 
additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material 
facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared. The debarring 
official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with 
any information and argument submitted by the respondent and any other 
information in the administrative record.
    (2) The debarring official may refer disputed material facts to 
another official for findings of fact. The debarring official may reject 
any such findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically 
determining them to be arbitrary and capricious or clearly erroneous.
    (3) The debarring official's decision shall be made after the 
conclusion of the proceedings with respect to disputed facts.
    (c)(1) Standard of proof. In any debarment action, the cause for 
debarment must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. Where 
the proposed debarment is based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the 
standard shall be deemed to have been met.
    (2) Burden of proof. The burden of proof is on the agency proposing 
debarment.
    (d) Notice of debarring official's decision. (1) If the debarring 
official decides to impose debarment, the respondent shall be given 
prompt notice:
    (i) Referring to the notice of proposed debarment;
    (ii) Specifying the reasons for debarment;
    (iii) Stating the period of debarment, including effective dates; 
and
    (iv) Advising that the debarment is effective for covered 
transactions throughout the executive branch of the Federal Government 
unless an agency head or an authorized designee makes the determination 
referred to in Sec. 620.215.
    (2) If the debarring official decides not to impose debarment, the 
respondent shall be given prompt notice of that decision. A decision not 
to impose debarment shall be without prejudice to a subsequent 
imposition of debarment by any other agency.


<R05>
Sec. 620.315  Settlement and voluntary exclusion.

    (a) When in the best interest of the Government, NSF may, at any 
time, settle a debarment or suspension action.
    (b) If a participant and the agency agree to a voluntary exclusion 
of the participant, such voluntary exclusion shall be entered on the 
Nonprocurement List (see subpart E).

[[Page 154]]


<R05>
620.320  Period of debarment.

    (a) Debarment shall be for a period commensurate with the 
seriousness of the cause(s). If a suspension precedes a debarment, the 
suspension period shall be considered in determining the debarment 
period.
    (1) Debarment for causes other than those related to a violation of 
the requirements of subpart F of this part generally should not exceed 
three years. Where circumstances warrant, a longer period of debarment 
may be imposed.
    (2) In the case of a debarment for a violation of the requirements 
of subpart F of this part (see 620.305(c)(5)), the period of debarment 
shall not exceed five years.
    (b) The debarring official may extend an existing debarment for an 
additional period, if that official determines that an extension is 
necessary to protect the public interest. However, a debarment may not 
be extended solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon 
which the initial debarment action was based. If debarment for an 
additional period is determined to be necessary, the procedures of 
Secs. 620.311 through 620.314 shall be followed to extend the debarment.
    (c) The respondent may request the debarring official to reverse the 
debarment decision or to reduce the period or scope of debarment. Such a 
request shall be in writing and supported by documentation. The 
debarring official may grant such a request for reasons including, but 
not limited to:
    (1) Newly discovered material evidence;
    (2) Reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which the 
debarment was based;
    (3) Bona fide change in ownership or management;
    (4) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; 
or
    (5) Other reasons the debarring official deems appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 620.325  Scope of debarment.

    (a) Scope in general. (1) Debarment of a person under these 
regulations constitutes debarment of all its divisions and other 
organizational elements from all covered transactions, unless the 
debarment decision is limited by its terms to one or more specifically 
identified individuals, divisions or other organizational elements or to 
specific types of transactions.
    (2) The debarment action may include any affiliate of the 
participant that is specifically named and given notice of the proposed 
debarment and an opportunity to respond (see Secs. 620.311 through 
620.314).
    (b) Imputing conduct. For purposes of determining the scope of 
debarment, conduct may be imputed as follows:
    (1) Conduct imputed to participant. The fraudulent, criminal or 
other seriously improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, 
partner, employee, or other individual associated with a participant may 
be imputed to the participant when the conduct occurred in connection 
with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of the 
participant, or with the participant's knowledge, approval, or 
acquiescence. The participant's acceptance of the benefits derived from 
the conduct shall be evidence of such knowledge, approval, or 
acquiescence.
    (2) Conduct imputed to individuals associated with participant. The 
fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of a 
participant may be imputed to any officer, director, shareholder, 
partner, employee, or other individual associated with the participant 
who participated in, knew of, or had reason to know of the participant's 
conduct.
    (3) Conduct of one participant imputed to other participants in a 
joint venture. The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper 
conduct of one participant in a joint venture, grant pursuant to a joint 
application, or similar arrangement may be imputed to other participants 
if the conduct occurred for or on behalf of the joint venture, grant 
pursuant to a joint application, or similar arrangement may be imputed 
to other participants if the conduct occurred for or on behalf of the 
joint venture, grant pursuant to a joint application, or similar 
arrangement or with the knowledge, approval, or acquiescence of these 
participants. Acceptance

[[Page 155]]

of the benefits derived from the conduct shall be evidence of such 
knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.


<R04>
                          Subpart D--Suspension


<R05>
Sec. 620.400  General.

    (a) The suspending official may suspend a person for any of the 
causes in Sec. 620.405 using procedures established in Secs. 620.410 
through 620.413.
    (b) Suspension is a serious action to be imposed only when:
    (1) There exists adequate evidence of one or more of the causes set 
out in Sec. 620.405, and
    (2) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.
    (c) In assessing the adequacy of the evidence, the agency should 
consider how much information is available, how credible it is given the 
circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, 
and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. This assessment 
should include an examination of basic documents such as grants, 
cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, and contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 620.405  Causes for suspension.

    (a) Suspension may be imposed in accordance with the provisions of 
Secs. 620.400 through 620.413 upon adequate evidence:
    (1) To suspect the commission of an offense listed in 
Sec. 620.305(a); or
    (2) That a cause for debarment under Sec. 620.305 may exist.
    (b) Indictment shall constitute adequate evidence for purposes of 
suspension actions.


<R05>
Sec. 620.410  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral. Information concerning the existence 
of a cause for suspension from any source shall be promptly reported, 
investigated, and referred, when appropriate, to the suspending official 
for consideration. After consideration, the suspending official may 
issue a notice of suspension.
    (b) Decisionmaking process. NSF shall process suspension actions as 
informally as practicable, consistent with principles of fundamental 
fairness, using the procedures in Secs. 620.411 through 620.413.


<R05>
Sec. 620.411  Notice of suspension.

    When a respondent is suspended, notice shall immediately be given:
    (a) That suspension has been imposed;
    (b) That the suspension is based on an indictment, conviction, or 
other adequate evidence that the respondent has committed irregularities 
seriously reflecting on the propriety of further Federal Government 
dealings with the respondent;
    (c) Describing any such irregularities in terms sufficient to put 
the respondent on notice without disclosing the Federal Government's 
evidence;
    (d) Of the cause(s) relied upon under Sec. 620.405 for imposing 
suspension;
    (e) That the suspension is for a temporary period pending the 
completion of an investigation or ensuing legal, debarment, or Program 
Fraud Civil Remedies Act proceedings;
    (f) Of the provisions of Secs. 620.411 through 620.413 and any other 
NSF procedures, if applicable, governing suspension decisionmaking; and
    (g) Of the effect of the suspension.


<R05>
Sec. 620.412  Opportunity to contest suspension.

    (a) Submission in opposition. Within 30 days after receipt of the 
notice of suspension, the respondent may submit, in person, in writing, 
or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to 
the suspension.
    (b) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. (1) If the 
suspending official finds that the respondent's submission in opposition 
raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension, 
respondent(s) shall be afforded an opportunity to appear with a 
representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and 
confront any witness the agency presents, unless:
    (i) The action is based on an indictment, conviction or civil 
judgment, or
    (ii) A determination is made, on the basis of Department of Justice 
advice, that the substantial interests of the Federal Government in 
pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on

[[Page 156]]

the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced.
    (2) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be 
prepared and made available at cost to the respondent, upon request, 
unless the respondent and the agency, by mutual agreement, waive the 
requirement for a transcript.


<R05>
Sec. 620.413  Suspending official's decision.

    The suspending official may modify or terminate the suspension (for 
example, see Sec. 620.320(c) for reasons for reducing the period or 
scope of debarment) or may leave it in force. However, a decision to 
modify or terminate the suspension shall be without prejudice to the 
subsequent imposition of suspension by any other agency or debarment by 
any agency. The decision shall be rendered in accordance with the 
following provisions:
    (a) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions: based on an 
indictment, conviction, or civil judgment; in which there is no genuine 
dispute over material facts; or in which additional proceedings to 
determine disputed material facts have been denied on the basis of 
Department of Justice advice, the suspending official shall make a 
decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative 
record, including any submission made by the respondent. The decision 
shall be made within 45 days after receipt of any information and 
argument submitted by the respondent, unless the suspending official 
extends this period for good cause.
    (b) Additional proceedings necessary. (1) In actions in which 
additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material 
facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared. The suspending 
official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with 
any information and argument submitted by the respondent and any other 
information in the administrative record.
    (2) The suspending official may refer matters involving disputed 
material facts to another official for findings of fact. The suspending 
official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after 
specifically determining them to be arbitrary or capricious or clearly 
erroneous.
    (c) Notice of suspending official's decision. Prompt written notice 
of the suspending official's decision shall be sent to the respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 620.415  Period of suspension.

    (a) Suspension shall be for a temporary period pending the 
completion of an investigation or ensuing legal, debarment, or Program 
Fraud Civil Remedies Act proceedings, unless terminated sooner by the 
suspending official or as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) If legal or administrative proceedings are not initiated within 
12 months after the date of the suspension notice, the suspension shall 
be terminated unless an Assistant Attorney General or United States 
Attorney requests its extension in writing, in which case it may be 
extended for an additional six months. In no event may a suspension 
extend beyond 18 months, unless such proceedings have been initiated 
within that period.
    (c) The suspending official shall notify the Department of Justice 
of an impending termination of a suspension, at least 30 days before the 
12-month period expires, to give that Department an opportunity to 
request an extension.


<R05>
Sec. 620.420  Scope of suspension.

    The scope of a suspension is the same as the scope of a debarment 
(see Sec. 620.325), except that the procedures of Secs. 620.410 through 
620.413 shall be used in imposing a suspension.


<R04>
        Subpart E--Responsibilities of GSA, NSF and Participants


<R05>
Sec. 620.500  GSA responsibilities.

    (a) In accordance with the OMB guidelines, GSA shall compile, 
maintain, and distribute a list of all persons who have been debarred, 
suspended, or voluntarily excluded by agencies under Executive Order 
12549 and these regulations, and those who have been determined to be 
ineligible.
    (b) At a minimum, this list shall indicate:
    (1) The names and addresses of all debarred, suspended, ineligible, 
and voluntarily excluded persons, in alphabetical order, with cross-
references

[[Page 157]]

when more than one name is involved in a single action;
    (2) The type of action;
    (3) The cause for the action;
    (4) The scope of the action;
    (5) Any termination date for each listing; and
    (6) The agency and name and telephone number of the agency point of 
contact for the action.


<R05>
Sec. 620.505  NSF responsibilities.

    (a) The agency shall provide GSA with current information concerning 
debarments, suspension, determinations of ineligibility, and voluntary 
exclusions it has taken. Until February 18, 1989, the agency shall also 
provide GSA and OMB with information concerning all transactions in 
which NSF has granted exceptions under Sec. 620.215 permitting 
participation by debarred, suspended, or voluntarily excluded persons.
    (b) Unless an alternative schedule is agreed to by GSA, the agency 
shall advise GSA of the information set forth in Sec. 620.500(b) and of 
the exceptions granted under Sec. 620.215 within five working days after 
taking such actions.
    (c) The agency shall direct inquiries concerning listed persons to 
the agency that took the action.
    (d) Agency officials shall check the Nonprocurement List before 
entering covered transactions to determine whether a participant in a 
primary transaction is debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily 
excluded (Tel. ).
    (e) Agency officials shall check the Nonprocurement List before 
approving principals or lower tier participants where agency approval of 
the principal or lower tier participant is required under the terms of 
the transaction, to determine whether such principals or participants 
are debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded.


<R05>
Sec. 620.510  Participants' responsibilities.

    (a) Certification by participants in primary covered transactions. 
Each participant shall submit the certification in appendix A to this 
part for it and its principals at the time the participant submits its 
proposal in connection with a primary covered transaction, except that 
States need only complete such certification as to their principals. 
Participants may decide the method and frequency by which they determine 
the eligibility of their principals. In addition, each participant may, 
but is not required to, check the Nonprocurement List for its principals 
(Tel. ). Adverse information on the certification will not necessarily 
result in denial of participation. However, the certification, and any 
additional information pertaining to the certification submitted by the 
participant, shall be considered in the administration of covered 
transactions.
    (b) Certification by participants in lower tier covered 
transactions. (1) Each participant shall require participants in lower 
tier covered transactions to include the certification in appendix B to 
this part for it and its principals in any proposal submitted in 
connection with such lower tier covered transactions.
    (2) A participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective 
participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it and its 
principals are not debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily 
excluded from the covered transaction by any Federal agency, unless it 
knows that the certification is erroneous. Participants may decide the 
method and frequency by which they determine the eligibility of their 
principals. In addition, a participant may, but is not required to, 
check the Nonprocurement List for its principals and for participants 
(Tel. ).
    (c) Changed circumstances regarding certification. A participant 
shall provide immediate written notice to NSF if at any time the 
participant learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted 
or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. Participants 
in lower tier covered transactions shall provide the same updated notice 
to the participant to which it submitted its proposals.

certification (Alternate I to appendix C) or
    (2) Such a number of employees of the grantee have been convicted of 
violations of criminal drug statutes for violations occurring in the

part).


<R05>
Sec. 620.625  Exception provision.

    The agency head may waive with respect to a particular grant, in 
writing, a suspension of payments under a grant, suspension or 
termination of a grant, or suspension or debarment of a grantee if the 
agency head determines that such a waiver would be in the public 
interest. This exception authority cannot be delegated to any other 
official.


<R05>
Sec. 620.630  Certification requirements and procedures.

    (a)(1) As a prior condition of being awarded a grant, each grantee 
shall make the appropriate certification to the Federal agency providing 
the grant, as provided in appendix C to this part.
    (2) Grantees are not required to make a certification in order to 
continue receiving funds under a grant awarded before March 18, 1989, or 
under a no-cost time extension of such a grant. However, the grantee 
shall make a one-time drug-free workplace certification for a non-
automatic continuation of

[[Page 160]]

such a grant made on or after March 18, 1989.
    (b) Except as provided in this section, all grantees shall make the 
required certification for each grant. For mandatory formula grants and 
entitlements that have no application process, grantees shall submit a 
one-time certification in order to continue receiving awards.
    (c) A grantee that is a State may elect to make one certification in 
each Federal fiscal year. States that previously submitted an annual 
certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 
1990 until June 30, 1990. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, this certification shall cover all grants to all State agencies 
from any Federal agency. The State shall retain the original of this 
statewide certification in its Governor's office and, prior to grant 
award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with respect 
to each grant, unless the Federal agency has designated a central 
location for submission.
    (d)(1) The Governor of a State may exclude certain State agencies 
from the statewide certification and authorize these agencies to submit 
their own certifications to Federal agencies. The statewide 
certification shall name any State agencies so excluded.
    (2) A State agency to which the statewide certification does not 
apply, or a State agency in a State that does not have a statewide 
certification, may elect to make one certification in each Federal 
fiscal year. State agencies that previously submitted a State agency 
certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 
1990 until June 30, 1990. The State agency shall retain the original of 
this State agency-wide certification in its central office and, prior to 
grant award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with 
respect to each grant, unless the Federal agency designates a central 
location for submission.
    (3) When the work of a grant is done by more than one State agency, 
the certification of the State agency directly receiving the grant shall 
be deemed to certify compliance for all workplaces, including those 
located in other State agencies.
    (e)(1) For a grant of less than 30 days performance duration, 
grantees shall have this policy statement and program in place as soon 
as possible, but in any case by a date prior to the date on which 
performance is expected to be completed.
    (2) For a grant of 30 days or more performance duration, grantees 
shall have this policy statement and program in place within 30 days 
after award.
    (3) Where extraordinary circumstances warrant for a specific grant, 
the grant officer may determine a different date on which the policy 
statement and program shall be in place.


<R05>
Sec. 620.635  Reporting of and employee sanctions for convictions of criminal drug offenses.

    (a) When a grantee other than an individual is notified that an 
employee has been convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute 
occurring in the workplace, it shall take the following actions:
    (1) Within 10 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, 
the grantee shall provide written notice, including the convicted 
employee's position title, to every grant officer, or other designee on 
whose grant activity the convicted employee was working, unless a 
Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt of such 
notifications. Notification shall include the identification number(s) 
for each of the Federal agency's affected grants.
    (2) Within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, 
the grantee shall do the following with respect to the employee who was 
convicted.
    (i) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to 
and including termination, consistent with requirements of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; or
    (ii) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug 
abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by 
a Federal, State, or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate 
agency.
    (b) A grantee who is an individual who is convicted for a violation 
of a criminal drug statute occurring during the conduct of any grant 
activity shall

[[Page 161]]

report the conviction, in writing, within 10 calendar days, to his or 
her Federal agency grant officer, or other designee, unless the Federal 
agency has designated a central point for the receipt of such notices.

 Appendix A to Part 620--Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, 
     and Other Responsibility Matters--Primary Covered Transactions

                     Instructions for Certification

    1. By signing and submitting this proposal, the prospective primary 
participant is providing the certification set out below.
    2. The inability of a person to provide the certification required 
below will not necessarily result in denial of participation in this 
covered transaction. The prospective participant shall submit an 
explanation of why it cannot provide the certification set out below. 
The certification or explanation will be considered in connection with 
the department or agency's determination whether to enter into this 
transaction. However, failure of the prospective primary participant to 
furnish a certification or an explanation shall disqualify such person 
from participation in this transaction.
    3. The certification in this clause is a material representation of 
fact upon which reliance was placed when the department or agency 
determined to enter into this transaction. If it is later determined 
that the prospective primary participant knowingly rendered an erroneous 
certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal 
Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for 
cause or default.
    4. The prospective primary participant shall provide immediate 
written notice to the department or agency to which this proposal is 
submitted if at any time the prospective primary participant learns that 
its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous 
by reason of changed circumstances.
    5. The terms covered transaction, debarred, suspended, ineligible, 
lower tier covered transaction, participant, person, primary covered 
transaction, principal, proposal, and voluntarily excluded, as used in 
this clause, have the meanings set out in the Definitions and Coverage 
sections of the rules implementing Executive Order 12549. You may 
contact the department or agency to which this proposal is being 
submitted for assistance in obtaining a copy of those regulations.
    6. The prospective primary participant agrees by submitting this 
proposal that, should the proposed covered transaction be entered into, 
it shall not knowingly enter into any lower tier covered transaction 
with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 
9.4, debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded 
from participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized by the 
department or agency entering into this transaction.
    7. The prospective primary participant further agrees by submitting 
this proposal that it will include the clause titled ``Certification 
Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion-
Lower Tier Covered Transaction,'' provided by the department or agency 
entering into this covered transaction, without modification, in all 
lower tier covered transactions and in all solicitations for lower tier 
covered transactions.
    8. A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a 
certification of a prospective participant in a lower tier covered 
transaction that it is not proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, 
subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded 
from the covered transaction, unless it knows that the certification is 
erroneous. A participant may decide the method and frequency by which it 
determines the eligibility of its principals. Each participant may, but 
is not required to, check the List of Parties Excluded from Federal 
Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.
    9. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require 
establishment of a system of records in order to render in good faith 
the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and information 
of a participant is not required to exceed that which is normally 
possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business 
dealings.
    10. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 6 of these 
instructions, if a participant in a covered transaction knowingly enters 
into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for 
debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, suspended, debarred, 
ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this 
transaction, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal 
Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for 
cause or default.

  Appendix C to Part 620--Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace 
                              Requirements

                     Instructions for Certification

    1. By signing and/or submitting this application or grant agreement, 
the grantee is providing the certification set out below.
    2. The certification set out below is a material representation of 
fact upon which reliance is placed when the agency awards the grant. If 
it is later determined that the grantee knowingly rendered a false 
certification, or otherwise violates the requirements of the Drug-Free 
Workplace Act, the agency, in addition to any other remedies available 
to the Federal Government, may take action authorized under the Drug-
Free Workplace Act.
    3. For grantees other than individuals, Alternate I applies.
    4. For grantees who are individuals, Alternate II applies.
    5. Workplaces under grants, for grantees other than individuals, 
need not be identified on the certification. If known, they may be 
identified in the grant application. If the grantee does not identify 
the workplaces at the time of application, or upon award, if there is no 
application, the grantee must keep the identity of the workplace(s) on 
file in its office and make the information available for Federal 
inspection. Failure to identify all known workplaces constitutes a 
violation of the grantee's drug-free workplace requirements.
    6. Workplace identifications must include the actual address of 
buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the 
grant takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (e.g., all 
vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while 
in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, 
performers in concert halls or radio studios).
    7. If the workplace identified to the agency changes during the 
performance of the grant, the grantee shall inform the agency of the 
change(s), if it previously identified the workplaces in question (see 
paragraph five).
    8. Definitions of terms in the Nonprocurement Suspension and 
Debarment common rule and Drug-Free Workplace common rule apply to this 
certification. Grantees' attention is called, in particular, to the 
following definitions from these rules:
    Controlled substance means a controlled substance in Schedules I 
through V of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812) and as 
further defined by regulation (21 CFR 1308.11 through 1308.15);
    Conviction means a finding of guilt (including a plea of nolo 
contendere) or imposition of sentence, or both, by any judicial body 
charged with the responsibility to determine violations of the Federal 
or State criminal drug statutes;
    Criminal drug statute means a Federal or non-Federal criminal 
statute involving the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, use, or 
possession of any controlled substance;
    Employee means the employee of a grantee directly engaged in the 
performance of work under a grant, including: (i) All direct charge 
employees; (ii) All indirect charge employees unless their impact or 
involvement is insignificant to the performance of the grant; and, (iii) 
Temporary personnel and consultants who are directly engaged in the 
performance of work under the grant and who are on the grantee's 
payroll. This definition does not include workers not on the payroll of 
the grantee (e.g., volunteers, even if used to meet a matching 
requirement; consultants or independent contractors not on the grantee's 
payroll; or employees of subrecipients or subcontractors in covered 
workplaces).

        Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace Requirements

             Alternate I. (Grantees Other Than Individuals)

    A. The grantee certifies that it will or will continue to provide a 
drug-free workplace by:
    (a) Publishing a statement notifying employees that the unlawful 
manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a 
controlled substance is prohibited in the grantee's workplace and 
specifying the actions that will be taken against employees for 
violation of such prohibition;
    (b) Establishing an ongoing drug-free awareness program to inform 
employees about--
    (1) The dangers of drug abuse in the workplace;

[[Page 164]]

    (2) The grantee's policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace;
    (3) Any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee 
assistance programs; and
    (4) The penalties that may be imposed upon employees for drug abuse 
violations occurring in the workplace;
    (c) Making it a requirement that each employee to be engaged in the 
performance of the grant be given a copy of the statement required by 
paragraph (a);
    (d) Notifying the employee in the statement required by paragraph 
(a) that, as a condition of employment under the grant, the employee 
will--
    (1) Abide by the terms of the statement; and
    (2) Notify the employer in writing of his or her conviction for a 
violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace no later 
than five calendar days after such conviction;
    (e) Notifying the agency in writing, within ten calendar days after 
receiving notice under paragraph (d)(2) from an employee or otherwise 
receiving actual notice of such conviction. Employers of convicted 
employees must provide notice, including position title, to every grant 
officer or other designee on whose grant activity the convicted employee 
was working, unless the Federal agency has designated a central point 
for the receipt of such notices. Notice shall include the identification 
number(s) of each affected grant;
    (f) Taking one of the following actions, within 30 calendar days of 
receiving notice under paragraph (d)(2), with respect to any employee 
who is so convicted--
    (1) Taking appropriate personnel action against such an employee, up 
to and including termination, consistent with the requirements of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; or
    (2) Requiring such employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug 
abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by 
a Federal, State, or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate 
agency;
    (g) Making a good faith effort to continue to maintain a drug-free 
workplace through implementation of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) 
and (f).
    B. The grantee may insert in the space provided below the site(s) 
for the performance of work done in connection with the specific grant:

Place of Performance (Street address, city, county, state, zip code)
 _______________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________

Check {time}  if there are workplaces on file that are not identified 
here.

              Alternate II. (Grantees Who Are Individuals)

    (a) The grantee certifies that, as a condition of the grant, he or 
she will not engage in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, 
dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance in conducting 
any activity with the grant;
    (b) If convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a 
violation occurring during the conduct of any grant activity, he or she 
will report the conviction, in writing, within 10 calendar days of the 
conviction, to every grant officer or other designee, unless the Federal 
agency designates a central point for the receipt of such notices. When 
notice is made to such a central point, it shall include the 
identification number(s) of each affected grant.

FR 37438, July 22, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 640.3  Actions requiring an environmental assessment and categorical exclusions.

    (a) The types of actions to be classified as ``major Federal 
actions'' subject to NEPA procedures are discussed generally in the CEQ 
regulations. Paragraph (b) of this section describes various classes of 
NSF actions that normally require the preparation of an environmental 
assessment or an EIS, and those classes that are categorically excluded. 
(Categorical exclusion is defined at 40 CFR 1508.4.) The word 
``normally'' is stressed; there may be individual cases in which 
specific factors require contrary action. NSF directorates and offices 
are responsible for identifying situations in which an environmental 
assessment or an EIS should be prepared even if not normally required by 
paragraph (b) of this paragraph.
    (b) Most NSF awards support individual scientific research projects 
and are not ``major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality 
of the human environment'' except in the sense that the long term effect 
of the accumulation of human knowledge is likely to affect the quality 
of the human environment. However, such long term effects are basically 
speculative and unknowable in advance; thus they normally do not provide 
a sufficient basis for classifying research as subject to NEPA (See 40 
CFR 1508.8) and are categorically excluded from an environmental 
assessment. Nevertheless, in some cases the actual procedures used in 
carrying out the research may have potential environmental effects, 
particularly where the project requires construction of facilities or 
major disturbance of the local environment brought about by blasting, 
drilling, excavating, or other means. Accordingly, except as provided in 
paragraph (c) of this section, the following types of activities require 
at least an environmental assessment:
    (1) Cases where developmental efforts are supported, if the project 
supports the transition of a particular technology from the development 
stage to large-scale commercial utilization.
    (2) Any project supporting construction, other than interior 
remodelling.
    (3) Cases where field work affecting the natural environment will be 
conducted.
    (4) Any project that will involve drilling of the earth, excavation, 
explosives, weather modification, or other techniques that may alter a 
local environment.
    (5) Any project that provides for the testing and release of 
biological-control agents for purposes of ecosystem manipulation and 
assessment of short- and long-term effects of major ecosystem 
perturbation.
    (c) Directorates having divisions or programs with a substantial 
number of projects that fall within categories (3),

[[Page 166]]

(4), and (5) in (b) of this section, are authorized to issue 
supplemental guidelines to Division Directors and Program Officers 
establishing subcategories of research methodologies or techniques for 
which environmental assessments need not be prepared. For example, if a 
program regularly supports research that involves noninvasive techniques 
or nonharmful invasive techniques (such as taking water or soil samples, 
or collecting non-protected species of flora and fauna) the directorate 
may determine that field projects otherwise coming under paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section which involve only the use of such techniques do 
not require an environmental assessment. However, any such guidelines 
must be submitted to the Chairman for approval.
    (d) In some cases within the categories listed in paragraph (b) of 
this section, it will be evident at the outset or after the assessment 
process is begun that an EIS should be prepared. In such cases an 
assessment need not be completed, but the process of preparing an EIS 
(See Sec. 640.5, of this part) should be started.


<R05>
Sec. 640.4  Responsibilities and procedures for preparation of an environmental assessment.

    (a) Program Officers, as the first point of decision in the review 
process, shall determine into which category incoming proposals fall, 
according to the criteria set forth in Sec. 640.3 of this part. 
Notwithstanding this responsibility of the Program Officer, the 
appropriate Division Director, Assistant Director, and other reviewing 
policy officials must assure that adequate analysis is being made.
    (b) Where appropriate, programs, divisions, or directorates will 
advise prospective applicants in program announcements, requests for 
proposals, and other NSF-prepared brochures of the requirement to 
furnish information regarding any environmental impact that the 
applicant's proposed study may have.
    (c) Should an environmental assessment be required, the directorate 
supporting the activity shall be responsible for its preparation. The 
grant or contract applicant may be asked to submit additional 
information in order that a reasonable and accurate assessment may be 
made. Though no specific format for an environmental assessment is 
prescribed, it shall be a separate document suitable for public review 
and shall serve the purpose described in 40 CFR 1508.9, which is quoted 
in full as follows:

                Section 1508.9  Environmental Assessment

    ``Environmental Assessment'':
    (a) Means a concise public document for which a Federal agency is 
responsible that serves to:
    (1) Briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining 
whether to prepare an environmental impact statement or a finding of no 
significant impact.
    (2) Aid an agency's compliance with the Act when no environmental 
impact statement is necessary.
    (3) Facilitate preparation of a statement when one is necessary.
    (b) Shall include brief discussions of the need for the proposal, of 
alternatives as required by section 102(2)(E), of the environmental 
impacts of the proposed action and alternatives, and a listing of 
agencies and persons consulted.

    (d) A copy of the assessment or drafts shall accompany the 
appropriate proposal throughout the NSF internal review and approval 
process. At the option of the directorate preparing the assessment, a 
draft may be submitted to the Committee for its review and comments. 
Prior to an award decision, one copy of all completed assessments shall 
be sent to the Chairman for review and updating of the Committee listing 
of assessments.
    (e) If, on the basis of an environmental assessment, it is 
determined that an EIS is not required, a Finding of No Significant 
Impact (FNSI) as described in 40 CFR 1508.13 will be prepared. The FNSI 
shall include the environmental assessment or a summary of it and be 
available to the public from the Committee. If the proposed action is 
one that normally requires an EIS, is closely similar to an action 
normally requiring an EIS, or is without precedent, the FNSI shall be 
made available for a 30 day public review period before any action is 
taken.

[[Page 167]]


<R05>
Sec. 640.5  Responsibilities and procedures for preparation of an environmental impact statement.

    (a) If initially or after an environmental assessment has been 
completed, it is determined that an environmental impact statement 
should be prepared, it and other related documentation will be prepared 
by the directorate responsible for the action in accordance with section 
102(2)(c) of the Act, this part, and the CEQ regulations. The 
responsible directorate will be in close communication with the grant or 
contract applicant and may have to rely extensively on his or her input 
in preparing the EIS. However, once a document is prepared it shall be 
submitted to the Chairman who, after such review by the Committee as is 
deemed necessary by the Chairman, shall transmit the document as 
required by CEQ regulations and this part. If the Chairman considers a 
document unsatisfactory, he or she shall return it to the responsible 
directorate for revision prior to an award decision.
    Specifically, the following steps, as discussed in the CEQ 
regulations, will be followed in preparing an EIS:
    (1) A notice of intent to prepare a draft EIS will be published as 
described in 40 CFR 1501.7.
    (2) Scoping, as described in 40 CFR 1501.7, will be conducted.
    (3) The format and contents of the draft and final EIS shall be as 
discussed in 40 CFR part 1502.
    (4) Comments on the draft EIS shall be invited as set forth in 40 
CFR 1503.1. The minimum period to be afforded for comments on a draft 
EIS shall be 45 days, unless a lesser period is necessary to comply with 
other specific statutory requirements or in case of emergency 
circumstances, as described in 40 CFR 1506.11.
    (5) The requirements of 40 CFR 1506.9 for filing of documents with 
the Environmental Protection Agency shall be followed.
    (6) The responsible directorate shall examine carefully the basis on 
which supportive studies have been conducted to assure that such studies 
are objective and comprehensive in scope and in depth.
    (7) The Act requires that the decisionmaking involved ``utilize a 
systematic, interdisciplinary approach that will insure the integrated 
use of the natural and social sciences and the environmental design 
arts.'' If such disciplines are not present on the NSF staff, 
appropriate use should be made of personnel of Federal, State, and local 
agencies, universities, non-profit organizations, or private industry.
    (8) A copy of the draft EIS or the final EIS (or a summary, if the 
size of the EIS does not make this practical) shall be included in and 
accompany the appropriate proposal throughout the NSF internal review 
and approval process.
    (b)(1) 40 CFR 1506.1 describes the types of actions that should not 
be taken during the NEPA process. Such actions shall be avoided by NSF 
personnel during the process of preparation of an EIS and for a period 
of thirty days after the final EIS is filed with EPA, unless such 
actions are necessary to comply with other specific statutory 
requirements.
    (2) 40 CFR 1506.10 also places certain limitations on the timing of 
agency decisions on taking ``major Federal actions''. In some cases the 
actual ``decision point'' may be more clear-cut than others. If the 
``action'' that necessitated the preparation of an EIS is one that would 
be carried out under grant, contract, or cooperative agreement, then the 
award shall not be made before the times set forth in 40 CFR 1506.10, 
unless such action is necessary to comply with other specific statutory 
requirements, or as exceptions are needed as provided in 40 CFR 1506.10, 
1506.11, or 1507.3. However, an award for preliminary planning proposals 
may be made before such times if it is so structured as to require 
further NSF approvals for funding the actual actions that might 
adversely affect the quality of the human environment. In such cases, 
the subsequent approvals for funding these actions will be considered 
the ``decision''. This is consistent with the requirement that 
environmental considerations undergo concurrent review with all other 
project planning considerations.
    (c) In appropriate cases, if the action involves other agencies, the 
Chairman may agree to designate another agency as ``lead agency'' and to 
cooperate as

[[Page 168]]

discussed in 40 CFR 1501.5 and 1501.6. In such cases, the Chairman has 
authority to alter the procedures described in (a) to the extent they 
are inconsistent with functions assigned to NSF under the ``cooperating 
agency'' arrangements.
    (d) A public record of decision stating what the decision was; 
identifying alternatives that were considered, including the 
environmentally preferable one(s); discussing any national policy 
considerations that entered into the decision; and summarizing a 
monitoring and enforcement program if applicable for mitigation, will be 
prepared. This record of decision will be prepared at the time the 
decision is made, or if appropriate, when the agency makes its 
recommendation for action to Congress. (See 40 CFR 1505.2.)

<R05>
Sec. 641.10  Purpose.

    These procedures are designed to elicit and evaluate information 
that will inform the National Science Foundation (NSF) of the potential 
environmental consequences of proposed U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) 
actions, so that relevant environmental considerations are taken into 
account by decisionmakers before reaching final decisions on whether or 
how to proceed with proposed actions. These procedures are consistent 
with and implement the requirements of:
    (a) Executive Order 12114 as it relates to NSF's Antarctic 
activities, and
    (b) the environmental assessment provisions of the Protocol on 
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.


<R05>
Sec. 641.11  Policy.

    It is the policy of NSF to use all practicable means, consistent 
with its authority, to ensure that potential environmental effects of 
actions undertaken by NSF in Antarctica, either independently or in 
cooperation with another country, are appropriately identified and 
considered during the decisionmaking process, and that appropriate 
environmental safeguards which would limit, mitigate or prevent adverse 
impacts on the Antarctic environment are identified.


<R05>
Sec. 641.12  Applicability.

    The requirements set forth in this part apply to all proposed 
projects, programs and actions authorized or approved by, or subject to 
the control and responsibility of NSF that may have an impact on the 
Antarctic environment.


<R05>
Sec. 641.13  Right of action

    The procedures set forth in this part establish internal procedures 
to be followed by NSF in considering the potential environmental effects 
of actions taken in Antarctica. Nothing in this part shall be construed

[57 FR 40339, Sept. 3, 1992, as amended at 59 FR 37438, July 22, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 641.15  Preliminary environmental review.

    (a) The responsible official shall be notified early in the general 
planning process of actions proposed by USAP components that may have 
impacts on the Antarctic environment, so that environmental review may 
be integrated into the planning and decisionmaking processes. The 
responsible official shall conduct a preliminary environmental review of 
each action, including consideration of the potential direct and 
reasonably foreseeable indirect effects of a proposed action on the 
Antarctic environment.
    (b) If, on the basis of the preliminary environmental review, the 
responsible official determines that an action will have less than a 
minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment, he will prepare 
an Environmental Action Memorandum briefly summarizing the environmental 
issues considered and conclusions drawn from the review. No further 
environmental review shall be necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 641.16  Preparation of environmental documents, generally.

    (a) Preparation of an environmental document. If the responsible 
official determines, either initially or on the basis of a preliminary 
environmental review, that a proposed action may have at least a minor 
or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment, he

[[Page 170]]

will prepare an environmental document in accordance with the provisions 
of this part. In making this determination, the responsible official 
should consider whether and to what degree the proposed action:
    (1) Has the potential to adversely affect the Antarctic environment;
    (2) May adversely affect climate and weather patterns;
    (3) May adversely affect air or water quality;
    (4) May affect atmospheric, terrestrial (including aquatic), glacial 
or marine environments;
    (5) May detrimentally affect the distribution, abundance or 
productivity or species, or populations of species of fauna and flora;
    (6) May further jeopardize endangered or threatened species or 
populations of such species;
    (7) May degrade, or pose substantial risk to, areas of biological, 
scientific, historic, aesthetic or wilderness significance;
    (8) Has highly uncertain environmental effects, or involves unique 
or unknown environmental risks; or
    (9) Together with other actions, the effects of any one of which is 
individually insignificant, may have at least minor or transitory 
cumulative environmental effects.
    (b) Prior assessments. Notwithstanding the provisions of 
Sec. 641.16(a), if (1) An environmental document (including a generic or 
programmatic CEE) or its equivalent has been prepared for a particular 
type of action; (2) That document includes an analysis of potential 
environmental effects that are directly relevant to the potential 
effects of the proposed action, taking in account factors such as the 
similarity of the actions and of the locations within which they take 
place; and (3) There are no potential site specific or other impacts 
that would require further evaluation, then a new environmental document 
need not be prepared. Instead, the responsible official shall prepare an 
Environmental Action Memorandum for the proposed action, cross-
referencing the previously prepared environmental document.
    (c) Exclusions. NSF has determined that the following actions will 
have less than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic 
environment, and are not subject to the procedures set forth in this 
part, except to the extent provided herein:
    (1) Scientific research activities involving:
    (i) Low volume collection of biological or geologic specimens, 
provided no more mammals or birds are taken than can normally be 
replaced by natural reproduction in the following season;
    (ii) Small-scale detonation of explosives in connection with seismic 
research conducted in the continental interior or Antarctica where there 
will be no potential for impact on native flora and fauna;
    (iii) Use of weather/research balloons, research rockets, and 
automatic weather stations that are to be retrieved; and
    (iv) Use of radioisotopes, provided such use complies with 
applicable laws and regulations, and with NSF procedures for handling 
and disposing of radioisotopes.
    (2) Interior remodelling and renovation of existing facilities.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if information developed during the 
planning of any of the actions described in this paragraph (c) indicates 
the possibility that the action may have at least a minor or transitory 
impact on the Antarctic environment, the environmental effects of the 
action shall be reviewed to determine the need for the preparation of an 
environmental document.
    (d) Coordination with other committees, offices and federal 
agencies. The responsible official shall notify NSF's Committee of 
Environmental Matters when he intends to prepare an environmental 
document, and will coordinate preparation of the document with those 
entities. Responsibility for preparation of the environmental document 
rests primarily with the responsible official, but, as soon as is 
feasible, he should consult with and encourage the participation of 
other knowledgeable individuals within NSF, and, where appropriate, with 
other individuals, government agencies and entities with relevant 
knowledge and expertise.
    (e) Type of environmental document. The type of environmental 
document required under this part depends on the

[[Page 171]]

nature of the proposed action under consideration. An IEE must be 
prepared for proposed actions which the responsible official concludes 
may have at least a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic 
environment and for which a CEE is not prepared. A CEE must be prepared 
if an IEE indicates, or if it is otherwise determined, that a proposed 
action is likely to have more than a minor or transitory impact on the 
Antarctic environment.
    (f) Obligation of funds. Because of logistic constraints (i.e., 
constraints due to transportation difficulties, inaccessibility of 
Antarctic bases for much of the year, and the need to obtain items or 
materials requiring long lead times), it may not be possible to complete 
the environmental review of a proposed action before funds must be 
committed and/or disbursed. In such cases, funds for the proposed action 
may be committed and/or disbursed, provided:
    (1) The appropriate environmental review is completed before 
implementation of the proposed action in Antarctica, and
    (2) Implementation plans for the proposed action will be modified or 
canceled, if appropriate, in light of the completed environmental review 
(including public comments, if applicable).

[57 FR 40339, Sept. 3, 1992, as amended at 59 FR 37438, July 22, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 641.17  Initial environmental evaluation.

    (a) Contents. An IEE shall contain sufficient detail to assess 
whether a proposed action may have more than a minor or transitory 
impact on the Antarctic environment, and shall include the following 
information:
    (1) A description of the proposed action, including its purpose, 
location, duration and intensity; and
    (2) Consideration of alternatives to the proposed action and any 
impacts that the proposed action may have on the Antarctic environment, 
including cumulative impacts in light of existing and known planned 
actions and existing information on such actions.
    (b) Further environmental review. If an IEE indicates that a 
proposed action is likely to have no more than a minor or transitory 
impact on the Antarctic environment, no further environmental review of 
the action is necessary provided that appropriate procedures, which may 
include monitoring, are put in place to assess and verify the impact of 
the action.
    (c) Availability to public. An annual list of IEEs and a description 
of any decisions taken in consequence thereof shall be provided to the 
Department of State for circulation to all Parties to the Protocol and 
to organizations or committees established pursuant to the Protocol or 
the Treaty, as required. The Environmental Officer, Division of Polar 
Programs, shall also make the list and copies of final IEEs available to 
the public upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 641.18  Comprehensive environmental evaluation.

    (a) Scoping. If it is determined that a CEE will be prepared, the 
responsible official shall publish a notice of intent to prepare a CEE 
in the Federal Register, inviting interested persons and government 
agencies to participate in the process of identifying significant issues 
relating to the proposed action and determining the scope of the issues 
to be addressed in the CEE.
    (b) Contents of CEE. A CEE shall be a concise and analytical 
document, prepared in accordance with the range of relevant issues 
identified in the scoping process. It shall contain sufficient 
information to permit informed consideration of the reasonably 
foreseeable potential environmental effects of a proposed action and 
possible alternatives to that proposed action. Such information shall 
include the following:
    (1) A description of the proposed action including its purpose, 
location, duration and intensity;
    (2) A description of the initial base-line environmental state with 
which predicted changes are to be compared, and a prediction of the 
future environmental state in the absence of the proposed action;
    (3) A description of the methods and data used to forecast the 
potential impacts of the proposed action;
    (4) An estimate of the nature, extent, duration and intensity of the 
likely direct potential impacts of the proposed action;

[[Page 172]]

    (5) A consideration of the potential indirect or second order 
impacts from the proposed action;
    (6) A consideration of potential cumulative impacts of the proposed 
action in light of existing activities and other known planned actions 
and available information on those actions;
    (7) A description of possible alternatives to the proposed action, 
including the alternative of not proceeding, and the potential 
consequences of those alternatives, in sufficient detail to allow a 
clear basis for choice among the alternatives and the proposed action;
    (8) Identification of measures, including monitoring, that could be 
employed to minimize, mitigate or prevent potential impacts of the 
proposed action, detect unforeseen impacts, provide early warning of any 
adverse effects, and carry out prompt and effective response to 
accidents;
    (9) Identification of unavoidable potential impacts of the proposed 
action;
    (10) Consideration of the potential effects of the proposed action 
on the conduct of scientific research and on other existing uses and 
values;
    (11) Identification of gaps in knowledge and uncertainties 
encountered in compiling the information required by this paragraph (b);
    (12) A non-technical summary of the information included in the CEE; 
and
    (13) The name and address of the person and/or organization which 
prepared the CEE, and the address to which comments thereon should be 
directed.
    (c) Circulation of draft CEE. A draft of each CEE shall be provided 
to the Department of State for circulation to all Parties to the 
Protocol and to organizations or committees established pursuant to the 
Protocol or Treaty, as required by the Protocol, and shall be made 
publicly available. Notice of such public availability shall be 
published in the Federal Register. All such parties shall have a period 
of not less than ninety (90) days within which to review and comment 
upon the draft CEE.
    (d) Final CEE. A final CEE shall address, and shall include or 
summarize, comments received on the draft CEE. The final CEE, notice of 
any decisions related thereto, and any evaluation of the significance of 
the predicted impacts in relation to the advantages of the proposed 
action shall be provided to the Department of State for circulation to 
all Parties to the Protocol, and shall be available to the public upon 
request, at least sixty (60) days prior to the commencement of the 
proposed activity in Antarctica. Notice of such public availability 
shall be published in the Federal Register.
    (e) Implementation of proposed action. No final decision shall be 
taken to proceed in Antarctica with an action for which a final CEE is 
required until after the earlier of:
    (1) The first Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting taking place at 
least one hundred and twenty days after circulation of the draft CEE, or
    (2) Fifteen months following the circulation of the draft CEE.


<R05>
Sec. 641.19  Modification of environmental documents.

    The responsible official should revise or supplement an 
environmental document if there is a change in a proposed action that 
may have more than a minor or transitory effect on the antarctic 
environment, or if there are new circumstances or information that 
indicate the action may have impacts not anticipated in the original 
environmental document.


<R05>
Sec. 641.20  Notification of the availability of environmental documents and other information.

    The Environmental Officer, Office of Polar Programs, shall make 
Environmental Action Memoranda, environmental documents and final data 
obtained under Sec. 641.21, available to the public upon request. 
However, notice of such availability need not be given, except as 
specifically provided in this part.

[57 FR 40339, Sept. 3, 1992, as amended at 59 FR 37438, July 22, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 641.21  Monitoring.

    Scientific, analytic and/or reporting procedures shall be put in 
place, including appropriate monitoring of key environmental indicators, 
to assess and verify the potential environmental impacts of actions 
which are the subject of a CEE. All proposed actions for which an 
environmental document has

[[Page 173]]

been prepared shall include procedures designed to provide a regular and 
verifiable record of the actual impacts of those actions, in order, 
inter alia, to
    (a) Enable assessments to be made of the extent to which such 
impacts are consistent with the Protocol; and
    (b) Provide information useful for minimizing or mitigating those 
impacts, and, where appropriate, information on the need for suspension, 
cancellation or modification of the action.


<R05>
Sec. 641.22  Cases of emergency.

    This part shall not apply to actions taken in cases of emergency 
relating to the safety of human life or of ships, aircraft or equipment 
and facilities of high value, or the protection of the environment which 
require an action to be taken without completion of the environmental 
review required by this part. Notice of any such actions which would 
otherwise have required the preparation of a CEE shall be provided 
immediately to the Department of State for circulation to all Parties to 
the Protocol and to committees and organizations established pursuant to 
the Treaty or Protocol, as required. A description of the emergency 
action undertaken shall also be provided to the Department of State for

<R05>
Sec. 650.1  Scope of part.

    This part contains the policies, procedures, and clauses that govern 
allocation of rights to inventions made in performance of NSF-assisted 
research. It applies to all current and future funding agreements 
entered into by the Foundation that relate to performance of scientific 
or engineering research. As stated in the NSF Acquisition Regulation 
(chapter 25 of title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations), this part 
applies to contracts as well as to grants and cooperative agreements.


<R05>
Sec. 650.2  National Science Foundation patent policy.

    As authorized by the National Science Board at its 230th meeting, 
October 15-16, 1981, the Director of the National Science Foundation has 
adopted the following statement of NSF patent policy.
    (a) In accordance with the Bayh-Dole Act and the Presidential 
Memorandum entitled ``Government Patent Policy'' issued February 18, 
1983, the Foundation will use the Patent Rights clause prescribed by the 
Department of Commerce in all its funding agreements for the performance 
of experimental, developmental, or research work, including awards made 
to foreign entities, unless the Foundation determines that some other 
provision would better serve the purposes of that Act or the interests 
of the United States and the general public.
    (b) In funding agreements covered by a treaty or agreement that 
provides that an international organization or foreign government, 
research institute, or inventor will own or share patent rights, the 
Foundation will acquire such patent rights as are necessary to comply 
with the applicable treaty or agreement.
    (c) If an awardee elects not to retain rights to an invention, the 
Foundation will allow the inventor to retain the

[[Page 174]]

principal patent rights unless the awardee, or the inventor's employer 
if other than the awardee, shows that it would be harmed by that action.
    (d) The Foundation will normally allow any patent rights not wanted 
by the awardee or inventor to be dedicated to the public through 
publication in scientific journals or as a statutory invention 
registration. However, if another Federal agency is known to be 
interested in the relevant technology, the Foundation may give it an 
opportunity to review and patent the invention so long as that does not 
inhibit the dissemination of the research results to the scientific 
community.


<R05>
Sec. 650.3  Source of authority.

    (a) 35 U.S.C. 200-212, commonly called the Bayh-Dole Act, as amended 
by title V of Public Law 98-620 (98 stat. 3335, 3364). That law controls 
the allocation of rights to inventions made by employees of small 
business firms and domestic nonprofit organizations, including 
universities, during federally-supported experimentation, research, or 
development. Government-wide implementing regulations are contained in 
part 401 of title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
    (b) Section 11(e) of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as 
amended, (42 U.S.C. 1870(e)) provides that the Foundation shall have the 
authority to do all things necessary to carry out the provisions of this 
Act, including, but without being limited thereto, the authority--to 
acquire by purchase, lease, loan, gift, or condemnation, and to hold and 
dispose of by grant, sale, lease, or loan, real and personal property of 
all kinds necessary for, or resulting from, the exercise of authority 
granted by this Act.
    (c) Section 12 of the NSF Act (42 U.S.C. 1871) provides that each 
contract or other arrangement executed pursuant to this Act which 
relates to scientific research shall contain provisions governing the 
disposition of inventions produced thereunder in a manner calculated to 
protect the public interest and the equities of the individual or 
organization with which the contract or other arrangement is executed.
    (d) The Presidential Memorandum entitled ``Government Patent 
Policy'' issued February 18, 1983, directs Federal agencies, to the 
extent permitted by law, to apply to all research performers the 
policies of the Bayh-Dole Act. Under the provisions of the National 
Science Foundation Act quoted above, the Foundation is permitted to 
apply the Bayh-Dole policies without restriction.


<R05>
Sec. 650.4  Standard patent rights clause.

    (a) The following Patent Rights clause will be used in every funding 
agreement awarded by the Foundation that relates to scientific or 
engineering research unless a special patent clause has been negotiated 
(see Sec. 650.5).

                     Patent Rights (September, 1997)

    (a) Definitions--(1) Invention means any invention or discovery 
which is or may be patentable or otherwise protectable under title 35 of 
the United States Code, to any novel variety of plant which is or may be 
protected under the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321 et 
seq.).
    (2) Subject invention means any invention of the grantee conceived 
or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under 
this grant, provided that in the case of a variety of plant, the date of 
determination (as defined in section 41(d) of the Plant Variety 
Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2401(d)) must also occur during the period of 
grant performance.
    (3) Practical application means to manufacture in the case of a 
composition or product, to practice in the case of a process or method, 
or to operate in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case, 
under such conditions as to establish that the invention is being 
utilized and that its benefits are to the extent permitted by law or 
Government regulations available to the public on reasonable terms.
    (4) Made when used in relation to any invention means the conception 
or first actual reduction to practice of such invention.
    (5) Small business firm means a domestic small business concern as 
defined at section 2 of Public Law 85-536 (15 U.S.C. 632) and 
implementing regulations of the Administrator of the Small Business 
Administration. For the purpose of this Patents Rights clause, the size 
standard for small business concerns involved in Government procurement 
and subcontracting at 13 CFR 121.3-8 and 13 CFR 121.3-12, respectively, 
will be used.
    (6) Nonprofit organization means a domestic university or other 
institution of higher education or an organization of the type described 
in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal

[[Page 175]]

Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)) and exempt from taxation under 
section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(a)) or any 
domestic nonprofit scientific or educational organization qualified 
under a State nonprofit organization statute.
    (b) Allocation of Principal Rights. The grantee may retain the 
entire right, title, and interest throughout the world to each subject 
invention subject to the provisions of this Patents Rights clause and 35 
U.S.C. 203. With respect to any subject invention in which the grantee 
retains title, the Federal Government shall have a nonexclusive, 
nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have 
practiced for or on behalf of the United States the subject invention 
throughout the world. If the award indicates it is subject to an 
identified international agreement or treaty, the National Science 
Foundation (NSF) also has the right to direct the grantee to convey to 
any foreign participant such patent rights to subject inventions as are 
required to comply with that agreement or treaty.
    (c) Invention Disclosure, Election of Title and Filing of Patent 
Applications by Grantee. (1) The grantee will disclose each subject 
invention to NSF within two months after the inventor discloses it in 
writing to grantee personnel responsible for the administration of 
patent matters. The disclosure to NSF shall be in the form of a written 
report and shall identify the grant under which the invention was made 
and the inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical 
detail to convey a clear understanding of the nature, purpose, 
operation, and, to the extent known, the physical, chemical, biological 
or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall 
also identify any publication, on sale or public use of the invention 
and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for 
publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at 
the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to NSF, the 
grantee will promptly notify NSF of the acceptance of any manuscript 
describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use 
planned by the grantee.
    (2) The grantee will elect in writing whether or not to retain title 
to any such invention by notifying NSF within two years of disclosure to 
NSF. However, in any case where publication, on sale, or public use has 
initiated the one year statutory period wherein valid patent protection 
can still be obtained in the United States, the period for election of 
title may be shortened by NSF to a date that is no more than 60 days 
prior to the end of the statutory period.
    (3) The grantee will file its initial patent application on an 
invention to which it elects to retain title within one year after 
election of title or, if earlier, prior to the end of any statutory 
period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the United 
States after a publication, on sale, or public use. The grantee will 
file patent applications in additional countries or international patent 
offices within either ten months of the corresponding initial patent 
application, or six months from the date when permission is granted by 
the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent 
applications when such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.
    (4) Requests for extension of the time for disclosure to NSF, 
election, and filing under subparagraphs (c) (1), (2), and (3) of this 
clause may, at the discretion of NSF, be granted.
    (d) Conditions When the Government May Obtain Title. The grantee 
will convey to NSF, upon written request, title to any subject 
invention:
    (1) If the grantee fails to disclose or elect the subject invention 
within the times specified in paragraph (c) above, or elects not to 
retain title; provided that NSF may only request title within 60 days 
after learning of the failure of the grantee to disclose or elect within 
the specified times.
    (2) In those countries in which the grantee fails to file patent 
applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) above; 
provided, however, that if the grantee has filed a patent application in 
a country after the times specified in paragraph (c) above, but prior to 
its receipt of the written request of NSF, the grantee shall continue to 
retain title in that country.
    (3) In any country in which the grantee decides not to continue the 
prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, or 
defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a 
subject invention.
    (e) Minimum Rights to Grantee. (1) The grantee will retain a 
nonexclusive royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject 
invention to which the Government obtains title, except if the grantee 
fails to disclose the subject invention within the times specified in 
paragraph (c) above. The grantee's license extends to its domestic 
subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of 
which the grantee is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses 
of the same scope to the extent the grantee was legally obligated to do 
so at the time the grant was awarded. The license is transferable only 
with the approval of NSF except when transferred to the successor of 
that part of the grantee's business to which the invention pertains.
    (2) The grantee's domestic license may be revoked or modified by NSF 
to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of 
the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive 
license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions at 37 CFR 
part 404. This license will

[[Page 176]]

not be revoked in that field of use or the geographical areas in which 
the grantee has achieved practical application and continues to make the 
benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. The 
license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the 
discretion of NSF to the extent the grantee, its licensees, or its 
domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical 
application in that foreign country.
    (3) Before revocation or modification of the license, NSF will 
furnish the grantee a written notice of its intention to revoke or 
modify the license, and the grantee will be allowed thirty days (or such 
other time as may be authorized by NSF for good cause shown by the 
grantee) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be 
revoked or modified. The grantee has the right to appeal, in accordance 
with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 concerning the licensing 
of Government-owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation 
or modification of its license.
    (f) Grantee Action to Protect Government's Interest. (1) The grantee 
agrees to execute or to have executed and promptly deliver to NSF all 
instruments necessary to:
    (i) Establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout 
the world in those subject inventions for which the grantee retains 
title, and
    (ii) Convey title to NSF when requested under paragraph (d) above, 
and to enable the Government to obtain patent protection throughout the 
world in that subject invention.
    (2) The grantee agrees to require, by written agreement, its 
employees, other than clerical and non-technical employees, to disclose 
promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the 
administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the 
grantee each subject invention made under this grant in order that the 
grantee can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) 
above, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications 
on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the 
subject inventions. The disclosure format should require, at a minimum, 
the information requested by paragraph (c)(1) above. The grantee shall 
instruct such employees through the employee agreements or other 
suitable educational programs on the importance of reporting inventions 
in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to 
U.S. or foreign statutory bars.
    (3) The grantee will notify NSF of any decision not to continue 
prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in 
a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, 
not less than thirty days before the expiration of the response period 
required by the relevant patent office.
    (4) The grantee agrees to include, within the specification of any 
United States patent application and any patent issuing thereon covering 
a subject invention, the following statement: ``This invention was made 
with Government support under (identify the grant) awarded by the 
National Science Foundation. The Government has certain rights in this 
invention.''
    (5) The grantee or its representative will complete, execute, and 
forward to NSF a confirmation of a License to the United States 
Government and the page of a United States patent application that 
contains the Federal support clause within two months of filing any 
domestic or foreign patent application.
    (g) Subcontracts. (1) The grantee will include this Patents Rights 
clause, suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subcontracts, 
regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, or research work. 
The subcontractor will retain all rights provided for the grantee in 
this Patents Rights clause, and the grantee will not, as part of the 
consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the 
subcontractor's subject inventions.
    (2) In the case of subcontracts, at any tier, when the prime award 
by the Foundation was a contract (but not a grant or cooperative 
agreement), NSF, subcontractor, and contractor agree that the mutual 
obligations of the parties created by this Patents Rights clause 
constitute a contract between the subcontractor and the Foundation with 
respect to those matters covered by this Patents Rights clause.
    (h) Reporting on Utilization of Subject Inventions. The grantee 
agrees to submit on request periodic reports no more frequently than 
annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at 
obtaining such utilization that are being made by the grantee or its 
licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information regarding 
the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross 
royalties received by the grantee, and such other data and information 
as NSF may reasonably specify. The grantee also agrees to provide 
additional reports in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken 
by NSF in accordance with paragraph (j) of this Patents Rights clause. 
As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), NSF agrees it will not disclose such 
information to persons outside the Government without the permission of 
the grantee.
    (i) Preference for United States Industry. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this Patents Rights clause, the grantee agrees that neither 
it nor any assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use 
or sell any subject invention in the United States unless such person 
agrees that any products

[[Page 177]]

embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the 
subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United 
States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an 
agreement may be waived by NSF upon a showing by the grantee or its 
assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to 
grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be 
likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under 
the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.
    (j) March-in Rights. The grantee agrees that with respect to any 
subject invention in which it has acquired title, NSF has the right in 
accordance with procedures at 37 CFR 401.6 and NSF regulations at 45 CFR 
650.13 to require the grantee, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a 
subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or 
exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or 
applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and 
if the grantee, assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, 
NSF has the right to grant such a license itself if NSF determines that:
    (1) Such action is necessary because the grantee or assignee has not 
taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective 
steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention in such 
field of use;
    (2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs 
which are not reasonably satisfied by the grantee, assignee, or their 
licensees;
    (3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use 
specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not 
reasonably satisfied by the grantee, assignee, or licensee; or
    (4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by 
paragraph (i) of this Patents Rights clause has not been obtained or 
waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any 
subject invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement.
    (k) Special Provisions for Grants with Nonprofit Organizations. If 
the grantee is a nonprofit organization, it agrees that:
    (1) Rights to a subject invention in the United States may not be 
assigned without the approval of NSF, except where such assignment is 
made to an organization which has as one of its primary functions the 
management of inventions, provided that such assignee will be subject to 
the same provisions as the grantee;
    (2) The grantee will share royalties collected on a subject 
invention with the inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors 
(when NSF deems it appropriate) when the subject invention is assigned 
in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR 401.10;
    (3) The balance of any royalties or income earned by the grantee 
with respect to subject inventions, after payment of expenses (including 
payments to inventors) incidental to the administration of subject 
inventions, will be utilized for the support of scientific research or 
education; and
    (4) It will make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances 
to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business firms 
and that it will give preference to a small business firm if the grantee 
determines that the small business firm has a plan or proposal for 
marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally likely to bring 
the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from 
applicants that are not small business firms; provided that the grantee 
is also satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and 
resources to carry out it plan or proposal. The decision whether to give 
a preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the 
grantee. However, the grantee agrees that the Secretary of Commerce may 
review the grantee's licensing program and decisions regarding small 
business applicants, and the grantee will negotiate changes to its 
licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the Secretary when the 
Secretary's review discloses that the grantee could take reasonable 
steps to implement more effectively the requirements of this paragraph 
(k)(4).
    (l) Communications. All communications required by this Patents 
Rights clause should be sent to: Patent Assistant, Office of the General 
Counsel, National Science Foundation, 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, 
VA 22230.

    (b) When the above Patent Rights clause is used in a funding 
agreement other than a grant, ``grant'' and ``grantee'' may be replaced 
by ``contract'' and ``contractor'' or other appropriate terms.

<R05>
Sec. 650.5  Special patent provisions.

    At the request of the prospective awardee or on recommendation from 
NSF staff, a Grants or Contracts Officer, with the concurrence of the 
cognizant Program Manager, may negotiate special patent provisions when 
he or she determines that exceptional circumstances require restriction 
or

[[Page 178]]

elimination of the right of a prospective awardee to retain title to any 
subject invention in order to better promote the policy and objectives 
of chapter 18 of title 35 of the United States Code or the National 
Science Foundation Act. The Grants or Contracts Officer will prepare the 
written determination required by Sec. 401.3(e) of title 37 of the Code 
of Federal Regulations and assure that appropriate reports are made to 
the Secretary of Commerce and Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small 
Business Administration as required in Sec. 401.3(f). Unless doing so 
would be inconsistent with an obligation imposed on the Foundation by 
statute, international agreement, or pact with other participants in or 
supporters of the research, every special patent provision will allow 
the awardee, after an invention has been made, to request that it be 
allowed to retain principal rights to that invention under 
Sec. 650.12(e) of this regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 650.6  Awards not primarily for research.

    (a) Awards not primarily intended to support scientific or 
engineering research need contain no patent provision. Examples of such 
awards are travel and conference grants.
    (b) NSF fellowships and traineeships are primarily intended to 
support education or training, not particular research. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 212 of title 35 of the United States Code, the 
Foundation claims no rights to inventions made by fellows or trainees. 
The following provision will be included in each fellowship or 
traineeship program announcement and made part of the award:

                      Intellectual Property Rights

    The National Science Foundation claims no rights to any inventions 
or writings that might result from its fellowship or traineeship awards. 
However, fellows and trainees should be aware that the NSF, another 
Federal agency, or some private party may acquire such rights through 
other support for particular research. Also, fellows and trainees should 
note their obligation to include an Acknowledgment and Disclaimer in any 
publication.


<R05>
Sec. 650.7  Awards affected by international agreements.

    (a) Some NSF awards are made as part of international cooperative 
research programs. The agreements or treaties underlying many of these 
programs require an allocation of patent rights different from that 
provided by the Patent Rights clause in Sec. 650.4(a). Therefore, as 
permitted by Sec. 401.5(d) of the implementing regulations for the Bayh-
Dole Act (37 CFR 401.5(d)), paragraph (b) of the standard Patent Rights 
clause in Sec. 650.4(a) has been modified to provide that the Foundation 
may require the grantee to transfer to a foreign government or research 
performer such rights in any subject invention as are contemplated in 
the international agreement. The award instrument will identify the 
applicable agreement or treaty.
    (b) After an invention is disclosed to the Patent Assistant, the 
recipient of an award subject to an international agreement will be 
informed as to what rights, if any, it must transfer to foreign 
participants. Recipients may also ask the Program Manager to provide 
them with copies of the identified international agreements before or 
after accepting an award.


<R05>
Sec. 650.8  Retention of rights by inventor.

    If an awardee elects not to retain rights to an invention, the 
inventor may request the NSF Patent Assistant for permission to retain 
principal patent rights. Such requests should be made as soon as 
possible after the awardee notifies the Patent Assistant that it does 
not want to patent the invention. Such requests will normally be granted 
unless either the awardee or the employer of the inventor shows that it 
would be harmed by that action. As required by Sec. 401.9 of the 
implementing regulations for the Bayh-Dole Act (37 CFR 401.9), the 
inventor will be subject to the same conditions that the awardee would 
have been, except that the special restrictions imposed on nonprofit 
organizations will not apply to the inventor.


<R05>
Sec. 650.9  Unwanted inventions.

    (a) The Foundation will normally allow any patent rights not wanted 
by the awardee or inventor to be dedicated

[[Page 179]]

to the public through publication in scientific and engineering journals 
or as a statutory invention registration under section 157 of title 35 
of the United States Code. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, the NSF Patent Assistant will acknowledge a negative election 
by encouraging the awardee and inventor to promptly make all research 
results available to the scientific and engineering community.
    (b) If the NSF Patent Assistant believes that another Federal agency 
is interested in the relevant technology, he or she may, after receiving 
the awardee's election not to patent and ascertaining that the inventor 
also does not want to patent, send a copy of the invention disclosure to 
that agency to give it an opportunity to review and patent the 
invention. Unless the agency expresses an interest in the invention 
within thirty days, the Patent Assistant will acknowledge the awardee's 
negative election by encouraging prompt publication of all research 
results. If the agency does express an interest in patenting the 
invention, the Patent Assistant will transfer to it all rights to the 
invention.


<R05>
Sec. 650.10  Inventions also supported by another Federal Agency.

    Section 401.13(a) of the implementing regulation for the Bayh-Dole 
Act (37 CFR 401.13(a)) provides that in the event that an invention is 
made under funding agreements of more than one federal agency, the 
agencies involved will, at the request of the grantee or contractor or 
on their own initiative, designate one agency to be responsible for the 
administration of the invention. Whenever the NSF Patent Assistant finds 
that another agency also supported an NSF subject invention, he or she 
will consult with the grantee or contractor and appropriate personnel in 
the other agency to determine if a single agency should be designated to 
administer the Government's rights in the invention. The Patent 
Assistant may transfer to, or accept from, any other Federal agency, 
responsibility for administering a jointly-supported invention.


<R05>
Sec. 650.11  Utilization reports.

    Paragraph (h) of the standard Patent Rights clause set forth in 
Sec. 650.4 obliges grantees ``to submit on request periodic reports no 
more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention 
or on efforts at obtaining such utilization''. At this time, the 
Foundation does not plan to request such reports except in connection 
with march-in investigations conducted under Sec. 650.13. This section 
will be amended to describe periodic reporting requirements if such are 
ever established.

[57 FR 18053, Apr. 28, 1992, as amended at 59 FR 37438, July 22, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 650.12  Waivers and approvals.

    (a) Requests for extension of time to disclose to the NSF Patent 
Assistant, make an election to retain title to, or file a patent on a 
subject invention will be granted by the NSF Patent Assistant unless he 
or she determines that such an extension would either imperil the 
securing of valid patent protection or unacceptably restrict the 
publication of the results of the NSF-supported research.
    (b) Approval of assignments by nonprofit organizations (required by 
subparagraph (k)(1) of the Patent Rights clause in Sec. 650.4(a)) will 
be given by the Patent Assistant unless he or she determines that the 
interests of the United States Government will be adversely affected by 
such assignment.
    (c) Approval of long-term exclusive licensing of NSF-assisted 
inventions by nonprofit organizations (restricted by earlier versions of 
the NSF Patents Rights clause and by pre-Bayh-Dole Institutional Patent 
Agreements and waiver conditions) will be given by the Patent Assistant 
unless he or she determines that the interests of the United States 
Government will be adversely affected by such waiver.
    (d) The preference for United States industry imposed by paragraph 
(i) of the Patent Rights clause in Sec. 650.4(a) may be waived by the 
NSF Patent Assistant as provided in that paragraph.
    (e) Special restrictions on or limitation of the right of an awardee 
to retain title to subject inventions imposed under Sec. 650.5 of this 
regulation may be

[[Page 180]]

waived by the Grants or Contracting Officer whenever he or she 
determines, after consultation with the cognizant Program Manager, that 
the reasons for imposing the restrictions or limitations do not require 
their application to a particular invention.
    (f) Requests for approvals and waiver under this section should be 
addressed to the NSF Patent Assistant as provided in paragraph (1) of 
the Patent Rights clause in Sec. 650.4(a). Requests under paragraph (a) 
of this section for extensions of time to disclose, elect, or file may 
be made by telephone or electronic mail as well as in writing. A written 
request for extension of time to disclose, elect, or file can be assumed 
to have been approved unless the Patent Assistant replies negatively 
within ten business days of the date such request was mailed, 
telecopied, or otherwise dispatched. Requests for approvals or waivers 
under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section must be in 
writing and should explain why an approval or waiver is justified under 
the stated criteria. The requester will be given a written explanation 
of the reasons for denial of a request covered by this section.


<R05>
Sec. 650.13  Exercise of march-in rights.

    (a) The procedures established by this section supplement those 
prescribed by Sec. 401.6 of the implementing regulation for the Bayh-
Dole Act (37 CFR Sec. 401.6) and apply to all march-in rights held by 
NSF including those resulting from funding agreements not covered by the 
Bayh-Dole Act.
    (b) Petitions requesting that the NSF exercise a march-in right 
should be addressed to the NSF Patent Assistant. Such petitions should:
    (1) Identify the patent or patent application involved and the 
relevant fields of use of the invention;
    (2) State the grounds for the proposed march-in;
    (3) Supply evidence that one or more of the four conditions creating 
a march-in right (lack of practical application, unsatisfied health or 
safety needs, unmet requirements for public use, or failure to prefer 
United States industry) is present; and
    (4) Explain what action by the Foundation is necessary to correct 
that condition.
    (c) If evidence received from a petitioner or from the Foundation's 
administration of the Patent Rights clause indicates that one or more of 
the four conditions creating a march-in right might exist, the NSF 
Patent Assistant will informally review the matter as provided in 
Sec. 401.6(b) of the implementing regulation. If that informal review 
indicates that one or more of the four conditions creating a march-in 
right probably exists, the Patent Assistant will initiate a formal 
march-in proceeding by issuing a written notice to the patent holder. 
That notice will provide all the information required by Sec. 401.6(c) 
of the implementing regulation. The patent holder may submit information 
and argument in opposition to the proposed march-in in person, in 
writing, or through a representative.
    (d) If the NSF Patent Assistant determines that a genuine dispute 
over material facts exists, he or she will identify the disputed facts 
and notify the NSF General Counsel. The General Counsel will create a 
cross-directorate fact-finding panel, which will establish its own fact-
finding procedures within the requirements of Sec. 401.6(e) of the 
implementing regulation based on the dimensions of the particular 
dispute. The Patent Assistant will serve as secretary to the panel, but 
will not take part in its deliberations. Written findings of facts will 
be submitted to the General Counsel, sent by certified mail to the 
patent holder, and made available to all other interested parties.
    (e) The NSF General Counsel will determine whether and how the 
Foundation should exercise a march-in right as provided in Sec. 401.6(g) 
of the implementing regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 650.14  Request for conveyance of title to NSF.

    (a) The procedures established by this section apply to the exercise 
of the Foundation's right under paragraph (d) of the Patent Rights 
clause in Sec. 650.4(a) to request conveyance of title to a subject 
invention if certain conditions exist.
    (b) The NSF Patent Assistant may request the recipient of an NSF 
award

[[Page 181]]

to convey to the Foundation or a designee title in one or more countries 
to any invention to which the awardee has elected not to retain title. 
The NSF Patent Assistant may request immediate conveyance of title to a 
subject invention if the awardee fails (1) to submit a timely invention 
disclosure, (2) to make a timely election to retain patent rights, or 
(3) to file a timely patent application; but only if he or she 
determines that such action is required to preserve patent rights.
    (c) The NSF Patent Assistant will informally review any apparent 
failure by an awardee to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) 
of the Patent Rights clause in Sec. 650.4(a). The interested 
institution, the inventor, the patent holder, and any other interested 
party will be given an opportunity to explain why a particular invention 
was not disclosed, why an election was not made, or why a patent 
application was not filed. If the Patent Assistant determines that a 
genuine dispute over material facts exists, a cross-directorate fact-
finding panel will be appointed by the General Counsel. The panel will 
establish its own fact-finding procedures based on the dimensions of the 
particular dispute. Written findings of facts will be submitted to the 
General Counsel, sent by certified mail to the patent holder, and made 
available to all other interested parties.
    (d) The NSF General Counsel will determine whether the Foundation 
should request conveyance of title or if it should retain title obtained 
under Sec. 650.14(b).


<R05>
Sec. 650.15  Appeals.

    (a) All actions by the NSF Patent Assistant under Sec. 650.8 denying 
an inventor's request to retain rights to a subject invention, under 
Sec. 650.12 denying a request for waiver, or under Sec. 650.14(d) 
denying the existence of a material dispute may be appealed to the 
Director of the NSF Division of Grants and Contracts by an affected 
party within thirty days. A request under Sec. 650.14(b) to immediately 
convey title to the Foundation may be appealed to the DGC Director by 
the title holder within five days.
    (b) All actions by a Grants and Agreements Officer or Contracting 
Officer refusing to eliminate restrictions on or limitation of the right 
of an awardee to retain title to subject inventions imposed under 
Sec. 650.5 of this regulation may be appealed to the Director of the NSF 
Division of Contracts, Policy, and Oversight (CPO) by an affected party 
within thirty days.
    (c) A decision by the General Counsel to exercise a march-in right 
or to request conveyance of title may be appealed by the patent holder 
or any affected licensee to the NSF Deputy Director within thirty days. 
When a march-in was initiated in response to a petition, the General 
Counsel's decision not to exercise a march-in right or to exercise it in 
a manner different from that requested in the petition may be appealed 
by the petitioner to the NSF Deputy Director within thirty days.
    (d) In reviewing the actions of the NSF Patent Assistant, a Grants 
and Agreements Officer, a Contracting Officer, or the General Counsel, 
the CPO Director or NSF Deputy Director will consider both the factual 
and legal basis for the action or determination and its consistency with 
the policies and objectives of the Foundation and, if applicable, the 
Bayh-Dole Act (35 U.S.C. 200-212) and implementing regulations at part 
401 of title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 650.16  Background rights.

    The Foundation will acquire rights to a research performer's pre-
existing technology only in exceptional circumstances where, due to the 
nature of the research being supported, the Foundation requires greater 
control over resulting inventions. The NSF Grants or Contracts Officer, 
with concurrence of the cognizant Program Manager, will negotiate a

Sec. 670.10  General issuance criteria.

    Upon receipt of a complete and properly-executed application for a 
permit and the expiration of the applicable public comment period, the 
Director will decide whether to issue the permit. In making this 
decision, the Director will consider, in addition to the specific 
criteria set forth in the appropriate subparts of this part:
    (a) Whether the authorization requested meets the objectives of the 
Act and the requirements of these regulations;
    (b) The judgment of persons having expertise in matters germane to 
the application; and
    (c) Whether the applicant has failed to disclose material 
information required or has made false statements about any material 
fact in connection with his application.

consistent with the Act and this part.
    (b) Denial. The applicant shall be notified in writing of the denial 
of any permit request or part of a request, and the reason for such 
denial. If authorized in the notice of denial, the applicant may submit 
further information, or reasons why the permit should not be denied. 
Such further submissions shall not be considered a new application.
    (c) Amendment of applications or permits. An applicant or permit 
holder desiring to have any term or condition of his application or 
permit modified must submit full justification and supporting 
information in conformance with the provisions of this subpart and the 
subpart governing the activities sought to be carried out under the 
modified permit. Any application for modification of a permit that 
involves a material change beyond the terms originally requested will 
normally be subject to the same procedures as a new application.
    (d) Notice of issuance or denial. Within 10 days after the date of 
the issuance or denial of a permit, the Director shall publish notice of

1531 et seq.), or any native bird which is protected under the Migratory 
Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 701 et seq.), the Director shall submit a 
copy of the application to the Secretary of Commerce or to the Secretary 
of the Interior, as appropriate. If the appropriate Secretary determines 
that a permit should not be issued pursuant to any of the cited acts, 
the Director shall not issue a permit. The Director shall inform the 
applicant of any denial by the appropriate secretary and no further 
action will be taken on the application. If, however, the appropriate 
Secretary issues a permit pursuant to the requirements of the cited 
acts, the Director still must determine whether the proposed action is 
consistent with the Act and these regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 671.11  Waste storage.

    (a) Pending the treatment, disposal or removal of any wastes 
pursuant to Sec. 671.12, all wastes shall be contained, confined or 
stored in a manner that will prevent dispersal into the environment;
    (b) All Antarctic hazardous wastes generated at or transported to 
any USAP station may be temporarily stored at such station prior to the 
treatment, disposal or removal of any wastes pursuant to Sec. 671.12, 
provided all such Antarctic hazardous waste is stored in either closed 
containers or tanks labeled to indicate their contents and the beginning 
date of accumulation of such waste, and further provided the following 
conditions are satisfied:
    (1) If Antarctic hazardous wastes, radioactive wastes, or medical 
wastes, are generated at or transported to McMurdo Station, they may be 
temporarily stored at that station for a period not to exceed 15 months;
    (2) If Antarctic hazardous wastes, radioactive wastes, or medical 
wastes, are generated at or transported to South Pole Station, they may 
be temporarily stored at that station while awaiting transport to 
McMurdo Station, for a period not to exceed 15 months;
    (3) If Antarctic hazardous wastes, radioactive wastes, or medical 
wastes, are generated at or transported to Palmer Station, they may be 
temporarily stored at that station while

[[Page 201]]

awaiting transport to McMurdo Station or other disposition, for a period 
not to exceed 28 months;
    (4) Containers holding Antarctic hazardous wastes must be:
    (i) In good, non-leaking condition with sufficient structural 
integrity for the storage of Antarctic hazardous waste;
    (ii) Made of or lined with materials which will not react with, and 
are otherwise compatible with, the Antarctic hazardous waste to be 
stored, so that the ability of the containers to contain such waste is 
not impaired;
    (iii) Stored in a manner that allows access for inspection and 
response to emergencies; and
    (iv) Inspected at least weekly for leakage and deterioration. All 
inspections must be appropriately documented.
    (5) Tank systems used for storing Antarctic hazardous wastes must be 
in good, non-leaking condition with sufficient structural integrity for 
the storing of hazardous wastes; and systems must be inspected weekly to 
detect corrosion or releases of waste and to collect data from 
monitoring and leak detection equipment, to the extent available, to 
ensure that they are functioning properly. All inspections must be 
appropriately documented. Prior to the expiration of the 15 month period 
referred to in Sec. 671.11(b)(1), all Antarctic hazardous wastes shall 
be treated or removed from Antarctica in accordance with Sec. 671.12.
    (6) Ignitable, reactive or incompatible wastes shall be properly 
segregated and protected from sources of ignition or reaction, as 
appropriate.
    (c) All Antarctic hazardous wastes generated at a location other 
than a permanent station may be temporarily stored at such location for 
a period not to exceed 12 months, in closed, non-leaking containers 
marked to indicate their contents. Such containers must be in good 
condition and made of or lined with material which will not react with 
and is otherwise compatible with the Antarctic hazardous waste stored 
therein so as not to impair the ability of the container to contain the 
waste. Prior to the expiration of the 12 month period referred to above, 
all such hazardous wastes shall be either:
    (1) Treated or processed, disposed of or removed from Antarctica 
pursuant to Sec. 671.12, or
    (2) Removed to a permanent station and temporarily stored at that 
station in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 671.12  Waste disposal.

    (a)(1) The following wastes shall be removed from Antarctica:
    (i) Radioactive materials;
    (ii) Electrical batteries;
    (iii) Fuel (both liquid and solid);
    (iv) Waste containing harmful levels of heavy metals or acutely 
toxic or harmful persistent compounds;
    (v) Poly-vinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethane foam, polystyrene foam, 
rubber and lubricating oils, treated timbers and other products 
containing additives which can produce harmful emissions or releases;
    (vi) All other plastic wastes except low density polyethylene 
containers (such as bags for storing wastes) provided such containers 
are incinerated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section;
    (vii) Solid, non-combustible wastes; and
    (viii) Fuel, oil and chemical drums that constitute waste.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the 
obligations set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) (vii) and (viii) of this 
section shall not apply if the Director determines that the removal of 
such wastes by any practicable option would cause greater adverse 
environmental impacts than would be caused by leaving them in their 
existing locations.
    (b) All liquid wastes other than sewage and domestic liquid wastes 
and wastes referred in paragraph (a) of this section shall be removed 
from Antarctica to the maximum extent practicable.
    (c) Sewage and domestic liquid wastes may be discharged directly 
into the sea, taking into account the assimilative capacity of the 
receiving marine environment, and provided that such discharge occurs, 
wherever practicable, where conditions exist for initial dilution and 
rapid dispersal, and further provided that large quantities of such 
wastes (generated in a station

[[Page 202]]

where the average weekly occupancy over the austral summer is 
approximately 30 individuals or more) shall be treated at least by 
maceration. If biological treatment processes are used, the by-product 
of such treatment may be disposed of into the sea provided disposal does 
not adversely affect the local environment.
    (d) Residues of introduced animal carcasses, laboratory culture of 
micro-organisms and plant pathogens, and introduced avian products must 
be removed from Antarctica unless incinerated, autoclaved or otherwise 
sterilized.
    (e) Combustible wastes not removed from Antarctica other than wastes 
referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, shall be burnt in 
incinerators which reduce harmful emissions or discharges to the maximum 
extent practicable and the solid residue of such incineration shall be 
removed from Antarctica; provided, however, that USAP may continue to 
bury such combustible wastes in snow pits at South Pole Station, but 
must phase out such practices before March 1, 1995. Any emission or 
discharge standards and equipment guidelines which may be recommended by 
the Committee for Environmental Protection constituted or to be 
constituted pursuant to the Protocol or by the Scientific Committee on 
Antarctic Research shall be taken into account.
    (f) Sewage and domestic liquid wastes and other liquid wastes not 
removed from Antarctica in accordance with other provisions of this 
section, shall, to the maximum extent practicable, not be disposed of 
onto sea ice, ice shelves or grounded ice-sheet unless such wastes were 
generated by stations located inland on ice shelves or on the grounded 
ice-sheet. In such event, the wastes may be disposed of in deep ice pits 
if that is the only practicable option, provided the ice pits are not 
located on known ice-flow lines which terminate at ice-free land areas 
or in blue ice areas of high ablation.
    (g) No wastes may be disposed of onto ice-free areas or into any 
fresh water system.
    (h) Open burning of wastes is prohibited at all permanent stations, 
and shall be phased out at all other locations by March 1, 1994. If it 
is necessary to dispose of waste by open burning prior to March 1, 1994, 
allowance shall be made for the wind direction and speed and the type of 
waste to be burnt to limit particulate deposition and to avoid such 
deposition over areas of special biological, scientific, historic, 
aesthetic or wilderness significance.
    (i) Each unauthorized release of waste in Antarctic shall be, to the 
maximum extent practicable, promptly cleaned up by the person 
responsible for such release.


<R05>
Sec. 671.13  Waste management for the USAP.

facilitate studies aimed at evaluating the environmental impacts of 
scientific activity and logistic support, the USAP shall classify its 
wastes in one of the following categories:
    (1) Sewage and domestic liquid wastes;
    (2) Other liquid wastes and chemicals, including fuels and 
lubricants;
    (3) Solid wastes to be combusted;
    (4) Other solid wastes; and
    (5) Radioactive material.
    (b) USAP shall prepare and annually review and update a waste 
management plan (including plans for waste reduction, storage and 
disposal) specifying for each of its permanent stations, field camps and 
ships (other than small boats that are part of the operations of 
permanent stations or are otherwise taken into account in existing 
management plans for ships):
    (1) Current and planned waste management arrangements, including 
final disposal;
    (2) Current and planned arrangement for assessing the environmental 
effects of waste and waste management;
    (3) Other efforts to minimize environmental effects of wastes and 
waste management; and
    (4) Programs for cleaning up existing waste disposal sites and 
abandoned work sites.
    (c) USAP shall designate one or more waste management officials to 
develop and monitor waste management plans and ensure that members of 
expeditions receive training so as to limit the impact of their 
activities on the Antarctic environment, and to inform

[[Page 203]]

them of the requirements of the Protocol and of this Part.
    (d) USAP shall, to the extent practicable, prepare an inventory of 
locations of past activities (i.e., traverses, fuel depots, field bases, 
crashed aircraft) so that such locations can be taken into account in 
planning future scientific, logistic and waste management programs.
    (e) USAP shall clean up its past and present waste disposal sites on 
land and abandoned work sites, except that it shall not be required to:
    (1) Remove any structure designated as a historic site or monument; 
or
    (2) Remove any structure or waste in circumstances where the removal 
would result in greater adverse environmental impact than leaving the 
structure or waste in its existing location.
    (f) USAP shall circulate waste management plans and inventories 
described in this section in accordance with the requirements of the 
Treaty and the Protocol.

or Treaty agree that a substance should be banned from use in 
Antarctica, the Director may designate such substance a banned 
substance.
    (b) If the Director determines that a substance is liable to create 
a hazard to health or the environment if improperly treated or 
processed, stored, transported, or disposed of, the Director may 
designate such substance a designated pollutant.
    (c) If the Director determines that a substance previously 
designated a banned substance no longer displays the characteristics 
described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Director may remove such 
substance from the list of banned substances (to the extent consistent 
with the provisions of the Protocol), but if the Director determines 
that such substance has the characteristics described in paragraph (b) 
of this section, it shall be redesignated a designated pollutant.
    (d) If the Director determines that a substance previously 
designated a designated pollutant no longer displays the characteristics 
described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Director may remove such 
substance from the list of designated pollutants.

through (d) of this section, the Director shall take into account all 
relevant new information obtained through monitoring activities or 
otherwise.

    (a) All rulings, orders, decisions, and other documents issued by 
the Presiding Officer shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk. Copies of 
all such documents shall be served personally, or by certified mail,

timely motion of a party to the proceeding, for good cause shown, and 
after consideration of prejudice to other parties, or (2) upon his own 
motion. Such a motion by a party may only be made after notice to all 
other parties, unless the

[[Page 208]]

movant can show good cause why serving notice is impracticable. The 
motion shall be filed in advance of the date on which the pleading, 
document or motion is due to be filed, unless the failure of a party to 
make timely motion for extension of time was the result of excusable 
neglect.
    (d) Service by mail. Service of the complaint is complete when the 
return receipt is signed. Service of all other pleadings and documents 
is complete upon mailing. Where a pleading or document is served by 
mail, five (5) days shall be added to the time allowed by these rules

    (a) Appearances. Any party may appear in person or by counsel or 
other representative. A partner may appear on behalf of a partnership 
and an officer may appear on behalf of a corporation. Persons who appear 
as counsel or other representative must conform to the standards of 
conduct and ethics required of practitioners before the courts of the 
United States.
    (b) Intervention. A motion for leave to intervene in any proceeding 
conducted under these rules must set forth the grounds for the proposed 
intervention, the position and interest of the movant, and whether the 
intervention will cause delay. Any person already a party to the 
proceeding may file an answer to a motion to intervene, making specific 
reference to the factors set forth in the foregoing sentence and 
paragraph (c) of this section, within ten (10) days after service of the 
motion for leave to intervene.
    (c) A motion for leave to intervene in a proceeding must ordinarily 
be filed before the first prehearing conference, or if there is no such 
conference, prior to the setting of a time and place for a hearing. Any 
motion filed after that time must include, in addition to the 
information set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, a statement of 
good cause for the failure to file in a timely manner. Agreements, 
arrangements, and other matters previously resolved during the 
proceeding are binding on the intervenor.
    (d) Disposition. The Presiding Officer may grant leave to intervene 
only if the movant demonstrates that (1) his presence in the proceeding 
would not unduly prolong or otherwise prejudice the adjudication of the 
rights of the original parties; (2) the movant will be adversely 
affected by a final order; and (3) the interests of the movant are not 
being adequately represented by the original parties. The intervenor 
becomes a full party to the proceeding upon the granting of leave to 
intervene.
    (e) Amicus curiae. Persons not parties to the proceeding who wish to 
file briefs may so move. The motion shall identify the interest of the 
applicant and shall state the reasons why the proposed amicus brief is 
desirable. If the motion is granted, the Presiding Officer or Director 
shall issue an order setting the time for filing such brief. An amicus 
curiae is eligible to participate in any briefing after his motion is 
granted, and shall be served with all

[[Page 209]]

briefs, motions, and orders relating to issues to be briefed.
    (f) Consolidation. The Presiding Officer may, by motion or sua 
sponte, consolidate any or all matters at issue in two or more 
proceedings docketed under these rules where (1) there exists common 
parties or common questions of fact or law; (2) consolidation would 
expedite and simplify consideration of the issues; and (3) consolidation 
would not adversely affect the rights of parties engaged in otherwise 
separate proceedings.
    (g) Severance. The Presiding Officer may, by motion or sua sponte, 
for good cause shown order any proceedings severed with respect to any 
or all parties or issues.


<R05>
Sec. 672.7  Issuance of complaint.

    (a) General. If the complainant has reason to believe that a person 
has violated any provision of the Antarctic Conservation Act, other Act 
or attendant regulations, or a permit issued under the ACA, he may 
institute a proceeding for the assessment of a civil penalty or other 
sanctions by issuing a complaint under the Act and these rules.
    (b) If the complainant has reason to believe that (1) a permittee 
violated any term or condition of the permit, or (2) a permittee 
misrepresented or inaccurately described any material fact in the permit 
application or failed to disclose all relevant facts in the permit 
application, or (3) other good cause exists for such action, he may 
institute a proceeding for the revocation or suspension of a permit by 
issuing a complaint under the Act and these rules. A complaint may seek 
suspension or revocation of a permit in addition to the assessment of a 
civil penalty.
    (c) Content and amendment of the complaint. All complaints shall 
include:
    (1) A statement reciting the section(s) of the Act, regulations, 
and/or permit authorizing the issuance of the complaint;
    (2) A concise statement of the factual basis for all alleged 
violations; and
    (3) Notice of the respondent's right to request a hearing on any 
material fact contained in the complaint, or on the appropriateness of 
the proposed sanction.
    (d) Each complaint for the assessment of a civil penalty shall also 
include:
    (1) Specific reference to each provision of the Act and implementing 
regulations which respondent is alleged to have violated;
    (2) The amount of the civil penalty which is proposed to be 
assessed; and
    (3) A statement explaining the reasoning behind the proposed 
penalty;
    (e) Each complaint for the revocation or suspension of a permit 
shall also include:
    (1) Specific reference to each term or condition of the permit which 
the respondent is alleged to have violated, to each alleged inaccuracy 
or misrepresentation in respondent's permit application, to each fact 
which the respondent allegedly failed to disclose in his permit 
application, or to other reasons which form the basis for the complaint;
    (2) A request for an order to either revoke or suspend the permit 
and a statement of the terms and conditions of any proposed partial 
suspension or revocation; and
    (3) A statement indicating the basis for recommending the 
revocation, rather than the suspension, of the permit, or vice versa.
    A copy of these rules shall accompany each complaint served.
    (f) Derivation of proposed civil penalty. The complainant shall 
determine the dollar amount of the proposed civil penalty in accordance 
with any criteria set forth in the Act and with any civil penalty 
guidance issued by NSF.
    (g) Amendment of the complaint. The complainant may amend the 
complaint once as a matter of right at any time before the answer is 
filed. Otherwise the complainant may amend the complaint only upon 
motion granted by the Presiding Officer. Respondent shall have twenty 
(20) additional days from the date of service of the amended complaint 
to file his answer.
    (h) Withdrawal of the complaint. The complainant may withdraw the 
complaint, or any part thereof, without prejudice one time before the 
answer has been filed. After one withdrawal before the filing of an 
answer, or after the filing of an answer, the complainant may withdraw 
the complaint, or any part thereof, without prejudice,

[[Page 210]]

only upon motion granted by the Presiding Officer.
    (i) Complainant, in cooperation with the Office of General Counsel, 
may refer cases to the Department of Justice for possible criminal 
prosecution if there is reason to believe that respondent willfully 
violated the Antarctic Conservation Act or its attendant regulations. 
Such referral does not automatically preclude NSF from proceeding 
administratively under the Act and these rules against the same 
respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 672.8  Answer to the complaint.

    (a) General. Where respondent (1) contests any material fact upon 
which the complaint is based; (2) contends that the amount of the 
penalty proposed in the complaint or the proposed revocation or 
suspension, as the case may be, is inappropriate; or (3) contends that 
he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, he shall file a written 
answer to the complaint with the Hearing Clerk. Any such answer to the 
complaint must be filed with the Hearing Clerk within twenty (20) days 
after service of the complaint.
    (b) Contents of the answer. The answer shall clearly and directly 
admit, deny or explain each of the factual allegations contained in the 
complaint. If respondent asserts he has no knowledge of a particular 
factual allegation, the allegation is deemed denied. The answer shall 
also state (1) the circumstances or arguments which are alleged to 
constitute the grounds of defense; (2) the facts which respondent 
intends to place at issue; and (3) whether a hearing is requested.
    (c) Request for hearing. A hearing upon the issues raised by the 
complaint and answer shall be held upon request of respondent in the 
answer. The Presiding Officer may deem the right to a hearing waived if 
it is not requested by respondent. In addition, a hearing may be held at 
the discretion of the Presiding Officer, sua sponte, to examine issues 
raised in the answer.
    (d) Failure to admit, deny, or explain. Failure of respondent to 
admit, deny, or explain any material factual allegation contained in the 
complaint constitutes an admission of the allegation.
    (e) Amendment of the answer. The respondent may amend the answer to 
the complaint upon motion granted by the Presiding Officer.


<R05>
Sec. 672.9  Motions.

    (a) General. All motions, except those made orally on the record 
during a hearing, shall (1) be in writing; (2) state the basis or 
grounds with particularity; (3) set forth the relief or order sought; 
and (4) be accompanied by any affidavit, certificate, or other evidence 
or legal memorandum relied upon.
    (b) Response to motions. A party must file a response to any written 
motion within ten (10) days after service of such motion, unless the 
Presiding Officer allows additional time. The response shall be 
accompanied by any affidavit, certificate, other evidence, or legal 
memorandum relied upon. If no response is filed within the designated 
period, the Presiding Officer may deem the parties to have waived any 
objection to the granting of the motion. The Presiding Officer may also 
set a shorter time for response, or make such other appropriate orders 
concerning the disposition of motions.
    (c) Ruling on Motions. The Presiding Officer shall rule on all 
motions, unless otherwise provided in these rules. The Presiding Officer 
may permit oral argument if he considers it necessary or desirable.


<R05>
Sec. 672.10  Default order.

    (a) Default. The Presiding Officer may find a party in default (1) 
after motion, upon failure to file a timely answer to the complaint; (2) 
after motion or sua sponte, upon failure to comply with a prehearing or 
hearing order of the Presiding Officer; or (3) after motion or sua 
sponte, upon failure to appear at a conference or hearing without good 
cause being shown. No finding of default on the basis of a failure to 
appear at a hearing shall be made against the respondent unless the 
complainant presents sufficient evidence to the Presiding Officer to 
establish a prima facie case against the respondent. Any motion for a 
default order shall include a proposed default order and shall be served 
upon all parties. The alleged defaulting party shall have twenty (20) 
days from service to reply

[[Page 211]]

to the motion. Default by respondent constitutes, for purposes of the 
pending action only, an admission of all facts alleged in the complaint 
and a waiver of respondent's right to a hearing on such factual 
allegations. If the complaint is for the assessment of a civil penalty, 
the penalty proposed in the complaint shall become due and payable by 
respondent without further proceedings sixty (60) days after a final 
order issued upon default. If the complaint is for the revocation or 
suspension of a permit, the conditions of revocation or suspension 
proposed in the complaint shall become effective without further 
proceedings on the date designated by the Presiding Officer in his final 
order issued upon default. Default by the complainant shall result in 
the dismissal of the complaint with prejudice.
    (b) Procedures upon default. When the Presiding Officer finds a 
default has occurred, he shall issue a default order against the 
defaulting party. This order shall constitute the initial decision, and 
shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk.
    (c) Contents of a default order. A default order shall include 
findings of fact showing the grounds for the order, conclusions 
regarding all material issues of law or discretion, and the penalty 
which is recommended, or the terms and conditions of permit revocation 
or suspension, or other sanctions.
    (d) The Presiding Officer may set aside a default order for good 
cause shown.


<R05>
Sec. 672.11  Informal settlement; consent agreement and order.

    (a) Settlement policy. The Agency encourages settlement of a 
proceeding at any time if the settlement is consistent with the 
provisions and objectives of the Act and applicable regulations. The 
respondent may confer with complainant concerning settlement whether or 
not the respondent requests a hearing. Settlement conferences shall not 
affect the respondent's obligation to file a timely answer.
    (b) Consent agreement. The parties shall forward a written consent 
agreement and a proposed consent order to the Presiding Officer whenever 
settlement or compromise is proposed. The consent agreement shall state 
that, for the purpose of this proceeding, respondent (1) admits the 
jurisdictional allegations of the complaint; (2) admits the facts 
stipulated in the consent agreement or neither admits nor denies 
specific factual allegations contained in the complaint; and (3) 
consents to the assessment of a stated civil penalty or to the stated 
permit revocation or suspension, or to other sanctions or actions in 
mitigation. The consent agreement shall include any and all terms of the 
agreement, and shall be signed by all parties or their counsel or 
representatives.
    (c) Consent order. No settlement or consent agreement shall dispose 
of any proceeding under the rules without a consent order from the 
Director or his delegatee. Before signing such an order, the Director or 
his delegatee may require that the parties to the settlement appear 
before him to answer inquiries relating to the consent agreement or 
order.
    (d) Actions by respondent to clean, protect, enhance, or benefit the 
environment. NSF may accept from respondent environmentally beneficial 
actions, in lieu of penalties, in whole or in part, assessed under the 
Antarctic Conservation Act. An assessment of the monetary value of any 
action in mitigation shall be made before that action is incorporated as 
a part of any consent agreement and order.


<R05>
Sec. 672.12  Prehearing conference.

    (a) Purpose of prehearing conference. Unless a conference appears 
unnecessary, the Presiding Officer, at any time before the hearing 
begins, shall direct the parties and their counsel or other 
representatives to appear at a conference before him to consider:
    (1) The settlement of the case;
    (2) The simplification of issues and stipulation of facts not in 
dispute;
    (3) The necessity or desirability of amendments to pleadings;
    (4) The exchange of exhibits, documents, prepared testimony, and 
admissions or stipulations of fact which will avoid unnecessary proof;
    (5) The limitation of the number of expert or other witnesses;
    (6) Setting a time and place for the hearing; and

[[Page 212]]

    (7) Any other matters which may expedite the proceeding.
    (b) Exchange of witness lists and documents. Unless otherwise 
ordered by the Presiding Officer, each party at the prehearing 
conference shall make available to all other parties (1) the names of 
the expert and other witnesses he intends to call, together with a brief 
narrative summary of their expected testimony, and (2) copies of all 
documents and exhibits which each party intends to introduce into 
evidence. Documents and exhibits shall be marked for identification as 
ordered by the Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer may exclude from 
evidence any document or testimony not disclosed at the prehearing 
conference. If the Presiding Officer permits the submittal of new 
evidence, he will grant parties a reasonable opportunity to respond.
    (c) Record of the prehearing conference. No transcript of a 
prehearing conference relating to settlement shall be made. With respect 
to other prehearing conferences, no transcript of any prehearing 
conferences shall be made unless ordered by the Presiding Officer upon 
motion of a party or sua sponte. The Presiding Officer shall prepare and 
file for the record a written summary of the action taken at the 
conference. The summary shall incorporate any written stipulations or 
agreements of the parties and all rulings and appropriate orders 
containing directions to the parties.
    (d) Unavailability of a prehearing conference. If a prehearing 
conference is unnecessary or impracticable, the Presiding Officer, on 
motion or sua sponte, may conduct a telephonic conference or direct the 
parties to correspond with him to accomplish any of the objectives set 
forth in this section.
    (e) Other discovery. (1) Except as provided by paragraph (b) of this 
section, further discovery shall be permitted only upon determination by 
the Presiding Officer that (i) such discovery will not in any way 
unreasonably delay the proceeding; (ii) the information to be obtained 
is not otherwise obtainable; and (iii) such information has significant 
probative value.
    (2) The Presiding Officer shall order depositions upon oral 
questions only upon a showing of good cause and upon a finding that (i) 
the information sought cannot be obtained by alternative methods; or 
(ii) there is substantial reason to believe that relevant and probative 
evidence may otherwise not be preserved for presentation by a witness at 
the hearing.
    (3) Any party may request further discovery by motion. Such a motion 
shall set forth (i) the circumstances warranting the taking of the 
discovery; (ii) the nature of the information expected to be discovered; 
and (iii) the proposed time and place where it will be taken. If the 
Presiding Officer determines that the motion should be granted, he shall 
issue an order granting discovery, with any qualifying conditions and 
terms.
    (4) When the information sought to be obtained is within the control 
of one of the parties, failure to comply with an order issued pursuant 
to this paragraph may lead to (i) the inference that the information to 
be discovered would be adverse to the party from whom the information 
was sought; or (ii) the issuance of a default.


<R05>
Sec. 672.13  Accelerated decision; decision to dismiss.

    (a) General. The Presiding Officer, upon motion of any party or sua 
sponte, may at any time render an accelerated decision in favor of the 
complainant or the respondent as to all or any part of the proceeding, 
without further hearing or upon such limited additional evidence, such 
as affidavits, as he may require, if no genuine issue of material fact 
exists and a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law regarding 
all or any part of the proceeding. In addition, the Presiding Officer, 
upon motion of the respondent, may at any time dismiss an action without 
further hearing or upon such limited additional evidence as he requires, 
if complainant fails to establish a prima facie case, or if other 
grounds show complainant has no right to relief.
    (b) Effect. (1) If an accelerated decision or a decision to dismiss 
is issued as to all the issues and claims in the proceeding, the 
decision constitutes an initial decision of the Presiding Officer, and 
shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk.

[[Page 213]]

    (2) If an accelerated decision or a decision to dismiss is rendered 
on less than all issues or claims in the proceeding, the Presiding 
Officer shall determine what material facts exist without substantial 
controversy and what material facts remain controverted in good faith. 
He shall then issue an interlocutory order specifying the facts which 
appear substantially uncontroverted, and the issues and claims upon 
which the hearing will proceed.


<R05>
Sec. 672.14  Scheduling the hearing.

    (a) When an answer is filed, the Hearing Clerk shall forward the 
complaint, the answer, and any other documents filed thus far in the 
proceeding to the Presiding Officer, who will notify the parties of his 
assignment.
    (b) Notice of hearing. If the respondent requests a hearing in his 
answer, or one is ordered by the Presiding Officer, the Presiding 
Officer shall serve upon the parties a notice setting forth a time and 
place for the hearing. The Presiding Officer may issue the notice of 
hearing at any appropriate time, but not later than twenty (20) days 
prior to the date set for the hearing.
    (c) Postponement of hearing. The Presiding Officer will not grant a 
request for postponement of a hearing except upon motion and for good 
cause shown.


<R05>
Sec. 672.15  Evidence.

    (a) General. The Presiding Officer shall admit all evidence which is 
not irrelevant, immaterial, unduly repetitious, or otherwise unreliable 
or of little probative value. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, 
evidence relating to settlement which would be excluded in the federal 
courts under Ru1e 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is inadmissible. 
In the presentation, admission, disposition, and use of evidence, the 
Presiding Officer shall preserve the confidentiality of trade secrets 
and other commercial and financial information. The confidential or 
trade secret status of any information shall not, however, preclude its 
introduction into evidence. The Presiding Officer may review such 
evidence in camera, and issue appropriate protective orders.
    (b) Examination of witnesses. Parties shall examine witnesses 
orally, under oath or affirmation, except as otherwise provided in these 
rules or by the Presiding Officer. Parties shall have the right to 
cross-examine a witness who appears at the hearing.
    (c) Verified statements. The Presiding Officer may admit into the 
record as evidence, in lieu of oral testimony, statements of fact or 
opinion prepared by a witness. The admissibility of the evidence 
contained in the statement shall be subject to the same rules as if the 
testimony were produced under oral examination. Before any such 
statement is read or admitted into evidence, the witness shall deliver a 
copy of the statement to the Presiding Officer, the reporter, and 
opposing counsel. The witness presenting the statement shall swear to or 
affirm the statement and shall be subject to appropriate oral cross-
examination.
    (d) Admission of affidavits where the witness is unavailable. The 
Presiding Officer may admit into evidence affidavits of witnesses who 
are ``unavailable,'' within the meaning of that term under Rule 804(a) 
of the Federal Rules of Evidence.
    (e) Exhibits. Where practicable, an original and one copy of each 
exhibit shall be filed with the Presiding Officer for the record and a 
copy shall be furnished to each party. A true copy of any exhibit may be 
substituted for the original.
    (f) Official notice. Official notice may be taken of any matter 
judicially noticeable in the Federal courts and of other facts within 
the specialized knowledge and experience of the Agency. Opposing parties 
shall be given adequate opportunity to show that such facts are 
erroneously noticed.


<R05>
Sec. 672.16  Objections and offers of proof.

    (a) Objection. Any objection concerning the conduct of the hearing 
may be made orally or in writing during the hearing. The party raising 
the objection must supply a short statement of its grounds. The ruling 
by the Presiding Officer on any objection and the reasons given for it 
shall be part of the record. An exception to each objection overruled 
shall be automatic and is not

[[Page 214]]

waived by further participation in the hearing.
    (b) Offer of proof. Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, 
the party offering the evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall 
be included in the record. The offer of proof for excluded oral 
testimony shall consist of a brief statement describing the nature of 
the evidence excluded. The offer of proof for excluded documents or 
exhibits shall consist of the insertion in the record of the documents 
or exhibits excluded.


<R05>
Sec. 672.17  Burden of presentation; burden of persuasion.

    The complainant has the burden of going forward with and of proving 
that the violation occurred as set forth in the complaint and that the 
proposed civil penalty, revocation, suspension, or other sanction, is 
appropriate. Following the establishment of a prima facie case, 
respondent has the burden of presenting and of going forward with any 
defense to the allegations set forth in the complaint. The Presiding 
Officer shall decide all controverted matters upon a preponderance of 
the evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 672.18  Filing the transcript.

    The hearing shall be transcribed verbatim. After the Presiding 
Officer closes the record, the reporter shall promptly transmit the 
original and certified copies to the Hearing Clerk, and one certified 
copy directly to the Presiding Officer. A certificate of service shall 
accompany each copy of the transcript. The Hearing Clerk shall notify 
all parties of the availability of the transcript and shall furnish the 
parties with a copy of the transcript upon payment of the cost of 
reproduction, unless a party can show that the cost is unduly 
burdensome. Any person not a party to the proceeding may obtain a copy 
of the transcript upon payment of the reproduction fee, except for those 
parts of the transcript ordered to be kept confidential by the Presiding 
Officer.


<R05>
Sec. 672.19  Proposed findings, conclusions, and order.

    Unless otherwise ordered by the Presiding Officer, any party may 
submit proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a proposed 
order, together with supporting briefs, within twenty (20) days after 
the parties are notified of the availability of the transcript. The 
Presiding Officer shall set a time by which reply briefs must be 
submitted. All submissions shall be in writing, shall be served upon all 
parties, and shall contain adequate references to the record and relied-
upon authorities.


<R05>
Sec. 672.20  Initial decision.

    (a) Filing and contents. The Presiding Officer shall issue and file 
with the Hearing Clerk an initial decision as soon as practicable after 
the period for filing reply briefs, if any, has expired. The initial 
decision shall contain findings of fact, conclusions regarding all 
material issues of law or discretion, the reasons for the findings and 
conclusions, a recommended civil penalty assessment or other sanction, 
if appropriate, and a proposed final order. Upon receipt of an initial 
decision, the Hearing Clerk shall forward a copy to all parties, and 
shall send the original, along with the record of the proceeding, to the 
Director.
    (b) Amount of civil penalty. If the Presiding Officer determines 
that a violation has occurred, he shall set the dollar amount of the 
recommended civil penalty in the initial decision in accordance with any 
criteria set forth in the Act, and must consider any civil penalty 
guidelines issued by NSF. If the Presiding Officer decides to assess a 
penalty different in amount from the penalty recommended in the 
complaint, he shall set forth in the initial decision the specific 
reasons for the increase or decrease. The Presiding Officer shall not 
raise a penalty from that recommended in the complaint if the respondent 
has defaulted.
    (c) Effect of initial decision. The initial decision of the 
Presiding Officer shall become the final order of the Agency within 
forty-five (45) days after its service upon the parties and without 
further proceedings unless (1) an appeal to the Director is filed by a 
party to the proceedings; or (2) the Director elects, sua sponte, to 
review the initial decision.

[[Page 215]]

    (d) Motion to reopen a hearing. A motion to reopen a hearing to take 
further evidence must be made no later than twenty (20) days after 
service of the initial decision on the parties and shall (1) state the 
specific grounds upon which relief is sought; (2) state briefly the 
nature and purpose of the evidence to be adduced; (3) show that such 
evidence is not cumulative; and (4) show good cause why such evidence 
was not adduced at the hearing. The motion shall be made to the 
Presiding Officer and filed with the Hearing Clerk. Parties shall have 
ten (10) days following service to respond. The Presiding Officer shall 
grant or deny such motion as soon as practicable. The conduct of any 
proceeding which may be required as a result of the granting of any 
motion to reopen shall be governed by the provisions of the applicable 
sections of these rules. The filing of a motion to reopen a hearing 
shall automatically stay the running of all time periods specified under 
these Rules until such time as the motion is denied or the reopened 
hearing is concluded.


<R05>
Sec. 672.21  Appeal from or review of interlocutory orders or rulings.

    (a) Request for interlocutory orders or rulings. Except as provided 
in this section, appeals to the Director or, upon delegation, to the 
General Counsel, shall obtain as a matter of right only from a default 
order, an accelerated decision or decision to dismiss, or an initial 
decision rendered after an evidentiary hearing. Appeals from other 
orders or rulings shall lie only if the Presiding Officer, upon motion 
of a party, certifies such orders or rulings to the Director on appeal. 
Requests for such certification shall be filed in writing within six (6) 
days of notice of the ruling or service of the order, and shall state 
briefly the grounds to be relied upon on appeal.
    (b) Availability of interlocutory appeal. The Presiding Officer may 
certify any ruling for appeal to the Director when (1) the order or 
ruling involves an important question of law or policy and there is 
substantial grounds for difference of opinion; and (2) either (i) an 
immediate appeal from the order or ruling will materially advance the 
ultimate resolution of the proceeding, or (ii) review after the final 
order is issued will be inadequate or ineffective.
    (c) Decision. If the Director or the General Counsel takes no action 
within thirty (30) days of the certification, the appeal is dismissed. 
If the Director or the General Counsel decides to hear the interlocutory 
appeal, he shall make and transmit his findings and conclusions to the 
Presiding Officer. When the Presiding Officer declines to certify an 
order or ruling to the Director on interlocutory appeal, it may be 
reviewed by the Director only upon appeal from the initial decision.
    (d) Stay of proceedings. The Presiding Officer may stay the 
proceedings for an interlocutory appeal. Proceedings will not be stayed 
except in extraordinary circumstances. Where the Presiding Officer 
grants a stay of more than thirty (30) days, such stay must be 
separately approved by the Director.


<R05>
Sec. 672.22  Appeal from or review of initial decision.

    (a) Notice of appeal. Any party may appeal any adverse initial 
decision of the Presiding Officer by filing a notice of appeal and an 
accompanying appellate brief with the Hearing Clerk and upon all other 
parties and amicus curiae within twenty (20) days after the initial 
decision is served upon the parties. The notice of appeal shall set 
forth alternative findings of fact, alternative conclusions regarding 
issues of law or discretion, and a proposed order together with relevant 
references to the record and the initial decision. The appellant's brief 
shall contain a statement of the issues presented for review, argument 
on the issues presented, and a short conclusion stating the precise 
relief sought, together with appropriate references to the record. 
Within twenty (20) days of the service of notices of appeal and briefs, 
any other party or amicus curiae may file with the Hearing Clerk a reply 
brief responding to argument raised by the appellant, together with 
references to the relevant portions of the record, initial decision, or 
opposing brief. Reply briefs shall be limited to the scope of the appeal 
brief.
    (b) Sua sponte review by the Director. Whenever the Director 
determines sua sponte to review an initial decision,

[[Page 216]]

the Hearing Clerk shall serve notice of such intention on the parties 
within forty-five (45) days after the initial decision is served upon 
the parties. The notice shall include a statement of issues to be 
briefed by the parties and a time schedule for the service and filing of 
briefs.
    (c) Scope of appeal or review. The appeal of the initial decision 
shall be limited to those issues raised by the parties during the course 
of the proceeding. If the Director determines that issues raised, but 
not appealed by the parties, should be argued, he shall give the parties 
or their representatives written notice of such determination to permit 
preparation of adequate argument. Nothing herein shall prohibit the 
Director from remanding the case to the Presiding Officer for further 
proceedings.
    (d) Argument. The Director may, upon request of a party or sua 
sponte, assign a time and place for oral argument.


<R05>
Sec. 672.23  Final order on appeal.

    (a) Contents of the final order. When an appeal has been taken or 
the Director issues a notice of intent to conduct review sua sponte, the 
Director shall issue a final order as soon as practicable after the 
filing of all appellate briefs or oral argument. The Director shall 
adopt, modify or set aside the findings and conclusions contained in the 
decision or order being reviewed and shall set forth in the final order 
the reasons for his actions. The Director may, in his discretion, 
increase or decrease the assessed penalty from the amount recommended in 
the decision or order being reviewed, except that if the order being 
reviewed is a default order, the Director may not increase the amount of 
the penalty.
    (b) Payment of a civil penalty. The respondent shall pay the full 
amount of the civil penalty assessed in the final order within sixty 
(60) days after receipt of the final order unless otherwise agreed by 
the parties. Payment shall be made by forwarding to the Hearing Clerk a 
cashier's check or certified check in the amount of the penalty assessed 
in the final order, payable to the Treasurer, United States of America.
    (c) Money due and owing the United States by virtue of an unappealed 
final decision or settlement order may be collected by referral to the 
Department of Justice for appropriate civil action against respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 672.24  Maximum civil monetary penalties for unintentional and intentional violations.

    (a) For violations occurring before January 1, 1997, the maximum 
civil penalty that may be assessed under Secs. 672.20(b) and 672.23(a) 
is set by the statute at $5,000 for unintentional violations and $10,000 
for intentional violations.
    (b) For violations occurring between January 1, 1997 and December 
31, 1997, the maximum civil penalty is adjusted under authority of the

note) as amended by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 
104-134, approved 4/26/96) to $5,500 for unintentional violations and 
$11,000 for intentional violations.
    (c) For violations occurring after December 31, 1997, the maximum 
civil penalty is adjusted under authority of the Federal Civil Penalties 
Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (28 U.S.C. 2461 note) as amended by the 
Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-134, approved 4/26/
96) to $12,000 for unintentional violations and $23,000 for intentional 
violations.

Sec. 675.1  Purpose and authority.

    (a) This part sets forth the procedures for medical screening to 
determine whether candidates for participation in the United States 
Antarctic

[[Page 217]]

Program (USAP) are physically qualified and psychologically adapted for 
assignment or travel to Antarctica. Medical screening examinations are 
necessary to determine the presence of any physical or psychological 
conditions that would threaten the health or safety of the candidate or 
other USAP participants or that could not be effectively treated by the 
limited medical care capabilities in Antarctica.
    (b) Presidential Memorandum No. 6646 (February 5, 1982) (available 
from the National Science Foundation, Office of Polar Programs, room 
755, 4201 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, VA 22230) sets forth the National 
Science Foundation's overall management responsibilities for the entire 
United States national program in Antarctica.


<R05>
Sec. 675.2  Medical examinations.

    (a) Any individual seeking to travel to Antarctica under sponsorship 
of the United States Antarctic Program must undergo a medical and dental 
examination to determine whether the individual is physically qualified 
for deployment to Antarctica.
    (b) The medical and dental examinations may be conducted by a 
qualified licensed physician or dentist of the candidate's choosing, or 
designated by the employing organization, following instructions 
provided by the USAP. The medical examinations shall include a medical 
history, physical examination and appropriate clinical tests which 
address major organ systems for medical conditions inconsistent with 
safe deployment to Antarctica.
    (c) The candidate's physician/dentist will submit the required 
medical information on the appropriate USAP-provided forms to a USAP-
designated physician who will determine whether the individual is 
qualified for deployment to Antarctica based upon Medical Clearance 
Criteria established by the USAP. All information requested on the forms 
shall be provided.
    (d) Candidates who anticipate spending the austral winter in 
Antarctica (when evacuation may be impossible) are subject to additional 
evaluation, including a determination of psychological adaptability for 
such an isolated assignment. Psychological evaluations of ``winter-
over'' candidates shall be performed by a qualified team of USAP-
designated physicians/clinical psychologists.


<R05>
Sec. 675.3   Medical clearance criteria.

    (a) The USAP shall establish Medical Clearance Criteria for 
determining eligibility for deployment to Antarctica. (See Medical 
Standards for Antarctic Deployment available from the National Science 
Foundation, Office of Polar Programs, room 755.09, 4201 Wilson Blvd., 
Arlington, VA 22230).
    The criteria will include examination of the following major organ 
systems:
    (1) Lungs and chest wall.
    (2) Heart and vascular system.
    (3) Abdominal organs and gastrointestinal system.
    (4) Endocrine or metabolic system.
    (5) Genitalia and urinary system.
    (6) Musculoskeletal.
    (7) Skin and cellular tissues.
    (8) Neurological Disorders.
    (9) Psychiatric or psychological.
    (10) Dental.
    (b) The USAP may review and revise the Medical Clearance Criteria 
periodically as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 675.4   Waiver process.

    (a) If an individual is found not physically qualified for 
deployment to Antarctica, the USAP's contractor will inform the 
individual of the determination and of the administrative waiver 
process, and will provide a waiver application package to the individual 
upon request.
    (b) The waiver applicant should send the completed waiver 
application package to the USAP's contractor which will forward the 
package to NSF's Office of Polar Programs for review and a determination 
on the appropriateness of a waiver. In making the waiver determination, 
the Office of Polar Programs may consult with other qualified medical 
personnel and may require waiver applicants to take further medical 
examinations or to furnish additional medical documentation in support 
of the waiver application.
    (c) The Director, Office of Polar Programs (or designee) will make a 
final determination, in the exercise of his or her discretion, on the 
appropriateness of a waiver on a case-by-case basis.

[[Page 218]]

    (d) Individuals for whom a waiver is determined to be appropriate 
are eligible for deployment to Antarctica subject to any necessary 
limitations/restrictions identified by the Director, Office of Polar 
Programs, or designee.

    (2) Employee includes, in addition to any individual defined in 5 
CFR 2635.102(h), any individual working at NSF under the 
Intergovernmental Personnel Act. It includes any part-time or 
intermittent employee, temporary consultant; but not a special 
Government employee, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 202(a).
    (3) Institution means any university, college, business firm, 
research institute, professional society, or other organization. It 
includes all parts of a university or college, including all 
institutions in a multi-institution State or city system. It includes 
any university consortium or joint corporation; but not the universities 
that belong to such a consortium. Those universities shall be considered 
separate institutions for purposes of this part.
    (4) Proposal means an application for an award and includes a bid.
    (b) Cross-references to employee ethical conduct standards and 
financial disclosure regulations. Members of the National Science Board 
and other employees of the National Science Foundation (NSF), including 
special Government employees, should refer to the Standards of Ethical 
Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch at 5 CFR part 2635, the 
National Science Foundation's regulations at 5 CFR part 5301 which 
supplement the executive branch Standards, and the executive branch 
financial disclosure regulations at 5 CFR part 2634.


<R05>
Sec. 680.11  Staff involvement with NSF proposals and awards.

    (a)(1) Many scientists, engineers, and educators interrupt active 
research and teaching careers to spend a year or two at NSF and then 
return to research and teaching, usually at the same institution from 
which they came. Many such visiting scientists, engineers, and educators 
(and a few permanent employees) who have been principal investigators 
under NSF awards before coming to NSF, retain some interest or 
association with the work. If an individual is a principal investigator 
under an NSF award, the individual is not precluded from retaining ties 
to the work after becoming an NSF employee. The employee may stay in 
contact with those who are continuing the work in the employee's 
laboratory or on his or her project. The employee may continue to 
supervise graduate students. And the employee may visit and work in the 
laboratory on his or her own time for these and related purposes.
    (2) Before a prospective employee comes to NSF, the prospective 
employee and the grantee institution

[[Page 219]]

must designate, subject to NSF approval, a ``substitute principal 
investigator''--i.e., another scientist who will be responsible for the 
work and equipment and will represent the institution in any dealings 
with NSF officials while the prospective employee is at NSF.
    (3) Appointment of a substitute principal investigator is 
unnecessary if all work under an award is to be completely suspended 
while the employee is at NSF. If the work is to be suspended, the 
employee and the grantee institution must inform the NSF in writing 
before the employee's employment begins. Work under the award may be 
resumed when the employee completes his or her NSF employment, and its 
term may be extended to account for the time lost during the employee's 
NSF employment.
    (b)(1) NSF will entertain no proposal on which a current NSF 
employee would be a senior investigator or equivalent, unless it is a 
proposal for continuation or extension of support for work on which the 
employee served in that capacity before coming to NSF. Any proposal for 
continuation of NSF support at essentially the same level (with 
reasonable allowance for inflation) will normally be considered a 
proposal for continuation or extension if it would support the work of 
the same investigator and his or her laboratory or group (if any) in the 
same general field of science, engineering, or education, 
notwithstanding that the focus of the work may change in response to 
research opportunities or educational needs.
    (2) Someone other than the current NSF employee must submit any such 
proposal for continuation or extension of work NSF previously supported 
and handle all negotiations with NSF, but the capacity in which the 
current NSF employee will serve should be clearly spelled out in the 
proposal.
    (c) In accordance with 5 CFR 5301.103(a)(1), an NSF employee may not 
receive, directly or indirectly, any salary, consulting fee, honorarium, 
or other form of compensation for services, or reimbursement of 
expenses, from an NSF award.


<R05>
Sec. 680.12  One-year NSF post-employment restrictions.

    (a) For one year after leaving NSF employment, a former NSF 
employee, including a special Government employee who has performed work 
for NSF on more than 60 days in the previous twelve months, shall not 
represent himself, herself, or any other person in dealings with any NSF 
official on any proposal, project, or other particular matter.
    (b) The one-year restriction contained in paragraph (a) of this 
section is in addition to any post-employment restriction imposed by 
statute, including 18 U.S.C. 207 and 41 U.S.C. 423. To the extent that 
any disqualification required by paragraph (a) of this section is not 
also required by statute, written exceptions may be granted by the NSF's 
General Counsel, whose decisions shall be final. Exceptions will be rare 
and will be granted only where strict application of the rules would 
result in undue hardship for former short-term employees or for other 
former employees, and when granting an exception would not result in an 
unfair advantage to the former employee.
    (c)(1) Paragraph (a) of this section applies to particular matters 
involving specific parties, such as grants, contracts, or other 
agreements; applications for permits, licenses, or the like; requests 
for rulings or similar official determinations; claims; investigations 
or audits; charges or accusations against individuals or firms; 
adjudicatory hearings; and court cases.
    (2) For former employees, other than special Government employees, 
paragraph (a) of this section also applies to particular matters that do 
not involve specific parties, such as:
    (i) Determinations to establish or dis-establish a particular 
program or set its budget level for a particular fiscal year;
    (ii) Decisions to undertake or terminate a particular project;
    (iii) Decisions to open or not open a contract to competitive 
bidding;
    (iv) General policy or rulemaking--including, for example, decisions 
on particular NSF rules or formal policy, such as adoption or amendment 
of a resolution by the National Science Board, promulgation or amendment 
of

[[Page 220]]

an NSF regulation or circular, amendment of standard grant or contract 
terms, or changes to NSF manuals or policy documents; and
    (v) Agency positions on particular legislative or regulatory 
proposals.
    (d) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to:
    (1) Any expression of a former employee's views on policy issues 
where the circumstances make it obvious that the former employee is only 
speaking as an informed and interested citizen, not representing any 
financial or other interests of his or her own or of any other person or 
institution with which he or she is associated;
    (2) Any appearance or communication concerning matters of a personal 
or individual nature, such as the former employee's taxes, salary, 
benefits, possible Federal employment, rights as a former employee, or 
the application of conflict-of-interest rules to something the former 
employee proposes to do;
    (3) Any appearance on the former employee's own behalf in any 
litigation or administrative proceeding; or
    (4) Any presentation of scientific or technical information (at a 
site visit, for example) or any other communication of scientific or 
technical information on work being proposed or conducted.
    (e) As soon as his or her NSF employment ceases, a former NSF 
employee (including any former special Government employee described in 
paragraph (a) of this section) may again be listed as principal 
investigator on an NSF award, may be listed as principal investigator in 
any proposal or award, and may sign a proposal as principal 
investigator. However, the former employee and the grantee institution 
shall formally designate, subject to NSF approval, a ``substitute 
negotiator'' who, though not principally responsible for the work, will 
represent the former employee and the institution in dealings with NSF 
officials on any proposal or project for as long as the former employee 
would be barred from representational contacts with NSF by paragraph (a) 
of this section or by statute.


<R05>
Sec. 680.13  Purposes for ``substitute'' requirements.

    Appointment of a ``substitute principal investigator'' or 
``substitute negotiator'' ensures against unthinking violation of the 
restrictions on dealings with NSF officials. It serves this purpose by 
flagging proposals or awards affected by the restrictions and by 
identifying someone else with whom NSF officials can properly discuss 
them or negotiate over them. Designation of a substitute principal 
investigator while an employee is at NSF has two additional functions: 
it identifies another person to be responsible for the work and 
equipment, and it reminds all concerned that during an employee's NSF 
service his or her attentions should focus on NSF duties.


<R04>
                     Subpart B--Statutory Exemptions


<R05>
Sec. 680.20  Exemptions under 18 U.S.C. 208(b).

    (a) The Foundation exempts the interests described in the remainder 
of this section from the operation of section 208(a) and from case-by-
case formal determinations under section 208(b)(1) of title 18, United 
States Code.
    (b) Minor interests. The following financial interests are too 
inconsequential to affect the integrity of an employee's services to the 
Government:
    (1) Noncorporate bonds;
    (2) Shares in a well-diversified money market or mutual fund;
    (3) Stocks, bonds, or other securities of a corporation listed on 
the New York or American Stock Exchange if the aggregate market value of 
all the securities you hold in that corporation does not exceed $1,000;
    (4) Vested pension rights to which no further contributions are 
being made by your former employer.
    (c) Indirect interests. An NSF employee may be a stockholder, 
partner, employee, officer, or director of an institution, such as a 
mutual fund, that owns a financial interest in a second institution. If 
the owning institution's financial interest consists of securities or 
other evidences of debt of the second institution that amount to:
    (1) Less than 5 percent of the total portfolio of investments of the 
owning institution,

[[Page 221]]

    (2) Less than 5 percent of the total outstanding amounts of the same 
classes of securities of the second institution, and
    (3) Less than would be needed to obtain effective control of the 
second institution,

then the interest is too remote and inconsequential to affect the 
integrity of the employee's services to the Government.
    (d) Policy determinations. Where a general policy determination of 
the Government might constitute a ``particular matter'' under 18 U.S.C. 
208(a) and might affect the home institution of an NSF officer or 
employee, but only in the same manner as all similar institutions, the 
officer or employee may participate in that determination.
    (e) Support services for National Science Board tasks and 
responsibilities. A member of the National Science Board may need 
professional, clerical, and administrative services to support the 
member's personal efforts to carry out Board tasks and responsibilities. 
With the approval of the Director and the Chairman of the National 
Science Board and in accordance with other laws and regulations, the NSF 
may contract with the home insitution of the member to provide such 
services. The institution may receive reimbursement of all allowable 
costs, but no profit or fee. In such circumstances any financial 
interests the institution might have are normally too inconsequential to 
affect the integrity of the services provided by the Board member to the 
Government.

<R05>
Sec. 689.1  General policies and responsibilities.

    (a) Misconduct means
    (1) Fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, or other serious 
deviation from accepted practices in proposing, carrying out, or 
reporting results from activities funded by NSF; or
    (2) Retaliation of any kind against a person who reported or 
provided information about suspected or alleged misconduct and who has 
not acted in bad faith.
    (b) The NSF will take appropriate action against individuals or 
institutions upon a determination that misconduct has occurred in 
proposing, carrying out, or reporting results from activities funded by 
NSF. It may also take interim action during an investigation. Possible 
actions are described in Sec. 689.2.
    (c) NSF will find misconduct only after careful inquiry and 
investigation by an awardee institution, by another Federal agency, or 
by NSF. An ``inquiry'' consists of preliminary information-gathering and 
preliminary fact-finding to determine whether an allegation or apparent 
instance of misconduct has substance. An investigation must be 
undertaken if the inquiry determines the allegation or apparent instance 
of misconduct has substance. An ``investigation'' is a formal 
examination and evaluation of relevant facts to determine whether 
misconduct has taken place or, if misconduct has already been confirmed, 
to assess its extent and consequences or determine appropriate action.
    (d) Before NSF makes any final finding of misconduct or takes any 
final action on such a finding, NSF will normally afford the accused 
individual or institution notice, a chance to provide comments and 
rebuttal, and a chance to appeal. In structuring procedures in 
individual cases, NSF may take into account procedures already followed 
by other entities investigating the same allegation of misconduct.

[[Page 222]]

    (e) Debarment or suspension for misconduct will be imposed only 
after further procedures described in applicable debarment and 
suspension regulations, as described in Secs. 689.7 and 689.8, 
respectively. Severe misconduct, as established under these regulations, 
is an independent cause for debarment or suspension under the procedures 
established by the debarment and suspension regulations.
    (f) The Office of Inspector General (OIG) oversees and coordinates 
NSF activities related to misconduct, conducts any NSF inquiries and 
investigations into suspected or alleged misconduct, and except where 
otherwise provided, speaks and acts for NSF with affected individuals 
and institutions.


<R05>
Sec. 689.2  Actions.

    (a) Possible final actions listed below for guidance range from 
minimal restrictions (Group I) to the most severe and restrictive (Group 
II). They are not exhaustive and do not include possible criminal 
sanctions.
    (1) Group I Actions.
    (i) Send a letter of reprimand to the individual or institution.
    (ii) Require as a condition of an award that for a specified period 
an individual, department, or institution obtain special prior approval 
of particular activities from NSF.
    (iii) Require for a specified period that an institutional official 
other than those guilty of misconduct certify the accuracy of reports 
generated under an award or provide assurance of compliance with 
particular policies, regulations, guidelines, or special terms and 
conditions.
    (2) Group II Actions.
    (i) Restrict for a specified period designated activities or 
expenditures under an active award.
    (ii) Require for a specified period special reviews of all requests 
for funding from an affected individual, department, or institution to 
ensure that steps have been taken to prevent repetition of the 
misconduct.
    (3) Group III Actions.
    (i) Immediately suspend or terminate an active award.
    (ii) Debar or suspend an individual, department, or institution from 
participation in NSF programs for a specified period after further 
proceedings under applicable regulations.
    (iii) Prohibit participation of an individual as an NSF reviewer, 
advisor, or consultant for a specified period.
    (b) In deciding what actions are appropriate when misconduct is 
found, NSF officials should consider:
    (1) How serious the misconduct was;
    (2) Whether it was deliberate or merely careless;
    (3) Whether it was an isolated event or part of a pattern;
    (4) Whether it is relevant only to certain funding requests or 
awards involving an institution or individual found guilty of 
misconduct.
    (c) Interim actions may include, but are not limitd to:
    (1) Totally or partially suspending an existing award;
    (2) Totally or partially suspending eligibility for NSF awards in 
accordance with debarment-and-suspension regulations;
    (3) Proscribing or restricting particular research activities, as, 
for example, to protect human or animal subjects;
    (4) Requiring special certifications, assurances, or other, 
administrative arrangements to ensure compliance with applicable 
regulations or terms of the award;
    (5) Requiring more prior approvals by NSF;
    (6) Deferring funding action on continuing grant increments;
    (7) Deferring a pending award;
    (8) Restricting or suspending use of individuals as NSF reviewers, 
advisors, or consultants.
    (d) For those cases governed by the debarment and suspension 
regulations, the standards of proof contained in those regulations shall 
control. Otherwise, NSF will take no final action under this section 
without a finding of misconduct supported by a preponderance of the 
relevant evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 689.3  Role of awardee institutions.

    (a) Awardee institutions bear primary responsibility for prevention 
and detection of misconduct. In most instances, NSF will rely on awardee 
institutions to promptly;
    (1) Initiate an inquiry into any suspected or alleged misconduct;

[[Page 223]]

    (2) Conduct a subsequent investigation, if warranted; and
    (3) Take action necessary to ensure the integrity of research, the 
rights and interests of research subjects and the public, and the 
observance of legal requirements or responsibilities.
    (b) If an institution wishes NSF to defer independent inquiry or 
investigation, NSF expects it to;
    (1) Inform NSF immediately if an initial inquiry supports a formal 
investigation.
    (2) Keep NSF informed during such an investigation.
    (3) Notify NSF even before deciding to initiate an investigation or 
as required during an investigation
    (i) If the seriousness of apparent misconduct warrants;
    (ii) If immediate health hazards are involved;
    (iii) If NSF's resources, reputation, or other interests need 
protecting;
    (iv) If Federal action may be needed to protect the interests of a 
subject of the investigation or of others potentially affected; or
    (v) If the scientific community or the public should be informed.
    (4) Provide NSF with the final report from any investigation.
    (c) If an institution wishes NSF to defer independent inquiry or 
investigation, it should complete any inquiry and decide whether an 
investigation is warranted within 90 days. It should similarly complete 
any investigation and reach a disposition within 180 days. If completion 
of an inquiry or investigation is delayed, but the institution wishes 
NSF deferral to continue, NSF may require submission of periodic status 
reports.
    (d) Awardee institutions should maintain and effectively communicate 
to their staffs appropriate policies and procedures relating to 
misconduct, which should indicate when NSF must or should be notified.


<R05>
Sec. 689.4  Initial NSF handling of misconduct matters

    (a) NSF staff who learn of alleged misconduct will promptly and 
discreetly inform OIG or refer informants to OIG.
    (b) To the extent possible the identify of informants who wish to 
remain anonymous will be kept confidential. To the extent allowed by 
law, documents and files maintained by NSF during the course of an 
inquiry or investigation of misconduct will be treated as investigative 
files exempt from mandatory pubic disclosure upon request under the 
Freedom of Information Act.
    (c) If alleged misconduct may involve a crime, OIG will determine 
whether any criminal investigation is already pending or projected. If 
not, OIG will determine whether the matter should be referred to the 
Department of Justice.
    (d) Otherwise OIG may:
    (1) Inform the awardee institution of the alleged misconduct and 
encourage it to undertake an inquiry;
    (2) Defer to inquiries or investigations of the awardee institution 
or of another Federal agency;
    (3) At any time proceed with its own inquiry.
    (e) If OIG proceeds with its own inquiry it will normally complete 
the inquiry no more than 60 days after initiating it.
    (f) On the basis of what it learns from an inquiry and in 
consultation as appropriate with other NSF offices, OIG will decide 
whether a formal NSF investigation is warranted.


<R05>
Sec. 689.5  Investigations

    (a) When an awardee institution or another Federal agency has 
promptly initiated its own investigation, OIG may defer an NSF inquiry 
or investigation until it receives the results of that external 
investigation. If it does not receive the results within 180 days, OIG 
will ordinarily proceed with its own investigation.
    (b) If OIG decides to initiate an NSF investigation, it must give 
prompt written notice to the individual or institutions to be 
investigated, unless notice would prejudice the investigation or unless 
a criminal investigation is underway or under active consideration. if 
notice is delayed, it must be given as soon as it will no longer 
prejudice the investigation or contravene requirements of law or Federal 
law-enforcement policies.

[[Page 224]]

    (c) If a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice, the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, or another Federal agency is underway 
or under active consideration by these agencies or the NSF, OIG will 
determine what information, if any, may be disclosed to the subject of 
the investigation or to other NSF employees.
    (d) An NSF investigation may include:
    (1) Review of award files, reports, and other documents already 
readily available at NSF or in the public domain;
    (2) Review of procedures or methods and inspection of laboratory 
materials, specimens, and records at awardee institutions;
    (3) Interviews with parties or witnesses;
    (4) Review of any documents or other evidence provided by or 
properly obtainable from parties, witnesses, or other sources;
    (5) Cooperation with other Federal agencies;
    (6) Opportunity for the subject of the investigation to be heard; 
and
    (7) Full adjudicatory hearings or other formal proceedings, as 
described in appropriate regulations.
    (e) NSF may invite outside consultants or experts to participate in 
an NSF investigation. They should be appointed in a manner that ensures 
the official nature of their involvement and provides them with legal 
protections available to federal employees.
    (f) OIG will make every reasonable effort to complete an NSF 
investigation and to report within 120 days after initiating it. If OIG 
cannot report within 120 days, it should submit to the Deputy Director 
within 90 days an interim report and an estimated schedule for 
completion of the final report.


<R05>
Sec. 689.6  Pending proposals and awards.

    (a) Upon learning of alleged misconduct OIG will identify 
potentially implicated awards or proposals and when appropriate, will 
ensure that program, grant, and contracting officers handling them are 
informed (subject to Sec. 689.5(c)).
    (b) Neither a suspicion or allegation of misconduct nor a pending 
inquiry or investigation will normally delay review of proposals. To 
avoid influencing reviews, reviewers or panelists will not be informed 
of allegations or of ongoing inquiries or investigations. However, if 
allegations, inquiries, or investigations have been rumored or 
publicized, the responsible Assistant Director may, in consultation with 
OIG, either defer review or inform reviewers of the status of the 
matter.

[56 FR 22287, May 14, 1991, as amended at 59 FR 37438, July 22, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 689.7  Interim administrative actions.

    (a) After an inquiry or during an external or NSF investigation the 
Deputy Director may order that interim actions (as described in 
Sec. 689.2(c)) be taken to protect Federal resources or to guard against 
continuation of any suspected or alleged misconduct. Such an order will 
normally be issued on recommendation from OIG and in consultation with 
the Division of Contracts, Policy, and Oversight or Division of Grants 
and Agreements, the Office of the General Counsel, the responsible 
Directorate, and other parts of the Foundation as appropriate.
    (b) When suspension is determined to be appropriate, the case will 
be referred to the suspending official pursuant to 45 CFR 620.410(a), 
and the suspension procedures of 45 CFR part 620 will be followed, but 
the suspending official (see Sec. 620.105(t)) will be either the Deputy 
Director or an official designated by the Deputy Director.
    (c) Such interim actions may be taken whenever information developed 
during an investigation indicates a need to do so. Any interim action 
will be reviewed periodically during an investigation and modified as 
warranted. An interested party may request a review and modification of 
any interim action.
    (d) The Deputy Director will make and OIG will retain a record of 
interim actions taken and the reasons for taking them.
    (e) Interim administrative actions are not final agency actions 
subject to appeal.

[56 FR 22287, May 14, 1991, as amended at 59 FR 37439, July 22, 1994]

[[Page 225]]


<R05>
Sec. 689.8  Dispositions.

    (a) After receiving a report from an external investigation by an 
awardee institution or another Federal agency, OIG will assess the 
accuracy and completeness of the report and whether the investigating 
entity followed usual and reasonable procedures. It will either 
recommend adoption of the findings in whole or in part or, normally 
within 30 days, initiate a new investigation.
    (b) When any satisfactory external investigation or an NSF 
investigation fails to confirm alleged misconduct and the Deputy 
Director concurs,
    (1) OIG will noitfy the subject of the investigation and, if 
appropriate, those who reported the suspected or alleged misconduct. 
This notification may include the investigation report.
    (2) Any interim administrative restrictions that were imposed will 
be lifted.
    (c) When any satisfactory investigation confirms misconduct,
    (1) In cases in which debarment is considered by OIG to be an 
appropriate disposition, the case will be referred to the debarring 
official pursuant to 45 CFR 620.311, and the procedures of 45 CFR part 
620 will be followed, but:
    (i) The debarring official (see Sec. 620.105(g)) will be either the 
Deputy Director, or an official designated by the Deputy Director.
    (ii) Except in unusual circumstances, the investigation report will 
be included among the materials provided to the subject of the 
investigation as part of the notice of proposed debarment (see 
Sec. 620.312).
    (iii) The notice of the debarring official's decision (see 
Sec. 620.314(d)) will include instructions on how to pursue an appeal to 
the Director.
    (2) In all other cases,
    (i) Except in unusual circumstances, the investigation report will 
be provided by OIG to the subject of the investigation, who will be 
invited to submit comments or rebuttal. Comments or rebuttal submitted 
within the period allowed, normally thirty days, will receive full 
consideration and may lead to revision of the report or of a recommended 
disposition.
    (ii) Normally within 45 days after completing an NSF investigation 
or receiving the report from a satisfactory external investigation, OIG 
will submit to the Deputy Director the investigation report, any 
comments or rebuttal from the subject of the investigation, and a 
recommended disposition. The recommended disposition will propose any 
final actions to be taken by NSF. Section 689.2 lists possible final 
actions and considerations to be used in determining them.
    (iii) The Deputy Director will review the investigation report and 
OIG's recommended disposition. Before issuing a disposition the Deputy 
Director may initiate further hearings or investigation. Normally within 
thirty days after receiving OIG's recommendations or after completion of 
any further proceedings, the Deputy Director will send the affected 
individual or institution a written disposition, specifying actions to 
be taken. The decision will include instructions on how to pursue an 
appeal to the Director.


<R05>
Sec. 689.9  Appeals.

    (a) An affected individual or institution may appeal to the Director 
in writing within 30 days after receiving the Deputy Director's written 
decision. The Deputy Director's decision becomes a final administrative 
action if it is not appealed within the 30 day period.
    (b) The Director may appoint an uninvolved NSF officer or employee 
to review an appeal and make recommendations.
    (c) The Director will inform the appellant of a final decision 
within 30 days after receiving the appeal. That decision will be the 
final administrative action of the Foundation. Findings from completed 
investigations may be shared with scientific review groups if the 
information bears directly on an investigator's scientific integrity or 
if necessary to provide an accurate account of relevant facts.

Sec. 690.101  To what does this policy apply?

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this policy 
applies to all research involving human subjects conducted, supported or 
otherwise subject to regulation by any federal department or agency 
which takes appropriate administrative action to make the policy 
applicable to such research. This includes research conducted by federal 
civilian employees or military personnel, except that each department or 
agency head may adopt such procedural modifications as may be 
appropriate from an administrative standpoint. It also includes research 
conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the federal 
government outside the United States.
    (1) Research that is conducted or supported by a federal department 
or agency, whether or not it is regulated as defined in Sec. 690.102(e), 
must comply with all sections of this policy.
    (2) Research that is neither conducted nor supported by a federal 
department or agency but is subject to regulation as defined in 
Sec. 690.102(e) must be reviewed and approved, in compliance with 
Sec. 690.101, Sec. 690.102, and Sec. 690.107 through Sec. 690.117 of 
this policy, by an institutional review board (IRB) that operates in 
accordance with the pertinent requirements of this policy.
    (b) Unless otherwise required by department or agency heads, 
research activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will 
be in one or more of the following categories are exempt from this 
policy:
    (1) Research conducted in established or commonly accepted 
educational settings, involving normal educational practices, such as 
(i) research on regular and special education instructional strategies, 
or (ii) research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among 
instructional techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods.
    (2) Research involving the use of educational tests (cognitive, 
diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview 
procedures or observation of public behavior, unless:
    (i) Information obtained is recorded in such a manner that human 
subjects can be identified, directly or through identifiers linked to 
the subjects; and (ii) any disclosure of the human subjects' responses 
outside the research could reasonably place the subjects at risk of 
criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial 
standing, employability, or reputation.
    (3) Research involving the use of educational tests (cognitive, 
diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview 
procedures, or observation of public behavior that is not exempt under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if:
    (i) The human subjects are elected or appointed public officials or 
candidates for public office; or (ii) federal statute(s) require(s) 
without exception that the confidentiality of the personally 
identifiable information will be maintained throughout the research and 
thereafter.
    (4) Research, involving the collection or study of existing data, 
documents, records, pathological specimens, or diagnostic specimens, if 
these sources are

[[Page 227]]

publicly available or if the information is recorded by the investigator 
in such a manner that subjects cannot be identified, directly or through 
identifiers linked to the subjects.
    (5) Research and demonstration projects which are conducted by or 
subject to the approval of department or agency heads, and which are 
designed to study, evaluate, or otherwise examine:
    (i) Public benefit or service programs; (ii) procedures for 
obtaining benefits or services under those programs; (iii) possible 
changes in or alternatives to those programs or procedures; or (iv) 
possible changes in methods or levels of payment for benefits or 
services under those programs.
    (6) Taste and food quality evaluation and consumer acceptance 
studies, (i) if wholesome foods without additives are consumed or (ii) 
if a food is consumed that contains a food ingredient at or below the 
level and for a use found to be safe, or agricultural chemical or 
environmental contaminant at or below the level found to be safe, by the 
Food and Drug Administration or approved by the Environmental Protection 
Agency or the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture.
    (c) Department or agency heads retain final judgment as to whether a 
particular activity is covered by this policy.
    (d) Department or agency heads may require that specific research 
activities or classes of research activities conducted, supported, or 
otherwise subject to regulation by the department or agency but not 
otherwise covered by this policy, comply with some or all of the 
requirements of this policy.
    (e) Compliance with this policy requires compliance with pertinent 
federal laws or regulations which provide additional protections for 
human subjects.
    (f) This policy does not affect any state or local laws or 
regulations which may otherwise be applicable and which provide 
additional protections for human subjects.
    (g) This policy does not affect any foreign laws or regulations 
which may otherwise be applicable and which provide additional 
protections to human subjects of research.
    (h) When research covered by this policy takes place in foreign 
countries, procedures normally followed in the foreign countries to 
protect human subjects may differ from those set forth in this policy. 
[An example is a foreign institution which complies with guidelines 
consistent with the World Medical Assembly Declaration (Declaration of 
Helsinki amended 1989) issued either by sovereign states or by an 
organization whose function for the protection of human research 
subjects is internationally recognized.] In these circumstances, if a 
department or agency head determines that the procedures prescribed by 
the institution afford protections that are at least equivalent to those 
provided in this policy, the department or agency head may approve the 
substitution of the foreign procedures in lieu of the procedural 
requirements provided in this policy. Except when otherwise required by 
statute, Executive Order, or the department or agency head, notices of 
these actions as they occur will be published in the Federal Register or 
will be otherwise published as provided in department or agency 
procedures.
    (i) Unless otherwise required by law, department or agency heads may 
waive the applicability of some or all of the provisions of this policy 
to specific research activities or classes of research activities 
otherwise covered by this policy. Except when otherwise required by 
statute or Executive Order, the department or agency head shall forward 
advance notices of these actions to the Office for Protection from 
Research Risks, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and shall 
also publish them in the Federal Register or in such other manner as 
provided in department or agency procedures.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Institutions with HHS-approved assurances on file will abide by 
provisions of title 45 CFR part 46 subparts A-D. Some of the other 
Departments and Agencies have incorporated all provisions of title 45 
CFR part 46 into their policies and procedures as well. However, the 
exemptions at 45 CFR 46.101(b) do not apply to research involving 
prisoners, fetuses, pregnant women, or human in vitro fertilization, 
subparts B and C. The exemption at 45 CFR 46.101(b)(2), for research 
involving survey or interview procedures or observation of public 
behavior, does not apply to research with children, subpart D, except 
for research involving observations of public behavior when the 
investigator(s) do not participate in the activities being observed.

<R05>
Sec. 690.102  Definitions.

    (a) Department or agency head means the head of any federal 
department or agency and any other officer or employee of any department 
or agency to whom authority has been delegated.
    (b) Institution means any public or private entity or agency 
(including federal, state, and other agencies).
    (c) Legally authorized representative means an individual or 
judicial or other body authorized under applicable law to consent on 
behalf of a prospective subject to the subject's participation in the 
procedure(s) involved in the research.
    (d) Research means a systematic investigation, including research 
development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute 
to generalizable knowledge. Activities which meet this definition 
constitute research for purposes of this policy, whether or not they are 
conducted or supported under a program which is considered research for 
other purposes. For example, some demonstration and service programs may 
include research activities.
    (e) Research subject to regulation, and similar terms are intended 
to encompass those research activities for which a federal department or 
agency has specific responsibility for regulating as a research 
activity, (for example, Investigational New Drug requirements 
administered by the Food and Drug Administration). It does not include 
research activities which are incidentally regulated by a federal 
department or agency solely as part of the department's or agency's 
broader responsibility to regulate certain types of activities whether 
research or non-research in nature (for example, Wage and Hour 
requirements administered by the Department of Labor).
    (f) Human subject means a living individual about whom an 
investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research 
obtains
    (1) Data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or
    (2) Identifiable private information.

Intervention includes both physical procedures by which data are 
gathered (for example, venipuncture) and manipulations of the subject or 
the subject's environment that are performed for research purposes. 
Interaction includes communication or interpersonal contact between 
investigator and subject. ``Private information'' includes information 
about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can 
reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and 
information which has been provided for specific purposes by an 
individual and which the individual can reasonably expect will not be 
made public (for example, a medical record). Private information must be 
individually identifiable (i.e., the identity of the subject is or may 
readily be ascertained by the investigator or associated with the 
information) in order for obtaining the information to constitute 
research involving human subjects.
    (g) IRB means an institutional review board established in accord 
with and for the purposes expressed in this policy.
    (h) IRB approval means the determination of the IRB that the 
research has been reviewed and may be conducted at an institution within 
the constraints set forth by the IRB and by other institutional and 
federal requirements.
    (i) Minimal risk means that the probability and magnitude of harm or 
discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of 
themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the 
performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.
    (j) Certification means the official notification by the institution 
to the supporting department or agency, in accordance with the 
requirements of this policy, that a research project or activity 
involving human subjects has been reviewed and approved by an IRB in 
accordance with an approved assurance.

[[Page 229]]


<R05>
Sec. 690.103  Assuring compliance with this policy--research conducted or supported by any Federal Department or Agency.

    (a) Each institution engaged in research which is covered by this 
policy and which is conducted or supported by a federal department or 
agency shall provide written assurance satisfactory to the department or 
agency head that it will comply with the requirements set forth in this 
policy. In lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, individual 
department or agency heads shall accept the existence of a current 
assurance, appropriate for the research in question, on file with the 
Office for Protection from Research Risks, HHS, and approved for 
federalwide use by that office. When the existence of an HHS-approved 
assurance is accepted in lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, 
reports (except certification) required by this policy to be made to 
department and agency heads shall also be made to the Office for 
Protection from Research Risks, HHS.
    (b) Departments and agencies will conduct or support research 
covered by this policy only if the institution has an assurance approved 
as provided in this section, and only if the institution has certified 
to the department or agency head that the research has been reviewed and 
approved by an IRB provided for in the assurance, and will be subject to 
continuing review by the IRB. Assurances applicable to federally 
supported or conducted research shall at a minimum include:
    (1) A statement of principles governing the institution in the 
discharge of its responsibilities for protecting the rights and welfare 
of human subjects of research conducted at or sponsored by the 
institution, regardless of whether the research is subject to federal 
regulation. This may include an appropriate existing code, declaration, 
or statement of ethical principles, or a statement formulated by the 
institution itself. This requirement does not preempt provisions of this 
policy applicable to department- or agency-supported or regulated 
research and need not be applicable to any research exempted or waived 
under Sec. 690.101 (b) or (i).
    (2) Designation of one or more IRBs established in accordance with 
the requirements of this policy, and for which provisions are made for 
meeting space and sufficient staff to support the IRB's review and 
recordkeeping duties.
    (3) A list of IRB members identified by name; earned degrees; 
representative capacity; indications of experience such as board 
certifications, licenses, etc., sufficient to describe each member's 
chief anticipated contributions to IRB deliberations; and any employment 
or other relationship between each member and the institution; for 
example: full-time employee, part-time employee, member of governing 
panel or board, stockholder, paid or unpaid consultant. Changes in IRB 
membership shall be reported to the department or agency head, unless in 
accord with Sec. 690.103(a) of this policy, the existence of an HHS-
approved assurance is accepted. In this case, change in IRB membership 
shall be reported to the Office for Protection from Research Risks, HHS.
    (4) Written procedures which the IRB will follow (i) for conducting 
its initial and continuing review of research and for reporting its 
findings and actions to the investigator and the institution; (ii) for 
determining which projects require review more often than annually and 
which projects need verification from sources other than the 
investigators that no material changes have occurred since previous IRB 
review; and (iii) for ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB of proposed 
changes in a research activity, and for ensuring that such changes in 
approved research, during the period for which IRB approval has already 
been given, may not be initiated without IRB review and approval except 
when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject.
    (5) Written procedures for ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB, 
appropriate institutional officials, and the department or agency head 
of (i) any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others 
or any serious or continuing noncompliance with this

[[Page 230]]

policy or the requirements or determinations of the IRB and (ii) any 
suspension or termination of IRB approval.
    (c) The assurance shall be executed by an individual authorized to 
act for the institution and to assume on behalf of the institution the 
obligations imposed by this policy and shall be filed in such form and 
manner as the department or agency head prescribes.
    (d) The department or agency head will evaluate all assurances 
submitted in accordance with this policy through such officers and 
employees of the department or agency and such experts or consultants 
engaged for this purpose as the department or agency head determines to 
be appropriate. The department or agency head's evaluation will take 
into consideration the adequacy of the proposed IRB in light of the 
anticipated scope of the institution's research activities and the types 
of subject populations likely to be involved, the appropriateness of the 
proposed initial and continuing review procedures in light of the 
probable risks, and the size and complexity of the institution.
    (e) On the basis of this evaluation, the department or agency head 
may approve or disapprove the assurance, or enter into negotiations to 
develop an approvable one. The department or agency head may limit the 
period during which any particular approved assurance or class of 
approved assurances shall remain effective or otherwise condition or 
restrict approval.
    (f) Certification is required when the research is supported by a 
federal department or agency and not otherwise exempted or waived under 
Sec. 690.101 (b) or (i). An institution with an approved assurance shall 
certify that each application or proposal for research covered by the 
assurance and by Sec. 690.103 of this Policy has been reviewed and 
approved by the IRB. Such certification must be submitted with the 
application or proposal or by such later date as may be prescribed by 
the department or agency to which the application or proposal is 
submitted. Under no condition shall research covered by Sec. 690.103 of 
the Policy be supported prior to receipt of the certification that the 
research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB. Institutions without 
an approved assurance covering the research shall certify within 30 days 
after receipt of a request for such a certification from the department 
or agency, that the application or proposal has been approved by the 
IRB. If the certification is not submitted within these time limits, the 
application or proposal may be returned to the institution.

<R05>
Secs. 690.104--690.106  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec.  690.107  IRB membership.

    (a) Each IRB shall have at least five members, with varying 
backgrounds to promote complete and adequate review of research 
activities commonly conducted by the institution. The IRB shall be 
sufficiently qualified through the experience and expertise of its 
members, and the diversity of the members, including consideration of 
race, gender, and cultural backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as 
community attitudes, to promote respect for its advice and counsel in 
safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. In addition to 
possessing the professional competence necessary to review specific 
research activities, the IRB shall be able to ascertain the 
acceptability of proposed research in terms of institutional commitments 
and regulations, applicable law, and standards of professional conduct 
and practice. The IRB shall therefore include persons knowledgeable in 
these areas. If an IRB regularly reviews research that involves a 
vulnerable category of subjects, such as children, prisoners, pregnant 
women, or handicapped or mentally disabled persons, consideration shall 
be given to the inclusion of one or more individuals who are 
knowledgeable about and experienced in working with these subjects.
    (b) Every nondiscriminatory effort will be made to ensure that no 
IRB consists entirely of men or entirely of women, including the 
institution's consideration of qualified persons of both sexes, so long 
as no selection is made to the IRB on the basis of gender. No

[[Page 231]]

IRB may consist entirely of members of one profession.
    (c) Each IRB shall include at least one member whose primary 
concerns are in scientific areas and at least one member whose primary 
concerns are in nonscientific areas.
    (d) Each IRB shall include at least one member who is not otherwise 
affiliated with the institution and who is not part of the immediate 
family of a person who is affiliated with the institution.
    (e) No IRB may have a member participate in the IRB's initial or 
continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting 
interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB.
    (f) An IRB may, in its discretion, invite individuals with 
competence in special areas to assist in the review of issues which 
require expertise beyond or in addition to that available on the IRB. 
These individuals may not vote with the IRB.


<R05>
Sec. 690.108  IRB functions and operations.

    In order to fulfill the requirements of this policy each IRB shall:
    (a) Follow written procedures in the same detail as described in 
Sec. 690.103(b)(4) and, to the extent required by, Sec. 690.103(b)(5).
    (b) Except when an expedited review procedure is used (see 
Sec. 690.110), review proposed research at convened meetings at which a 
majority of the members of the IRB are present, including at least one 
member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas. In order for 
the research to be approved, it shall receive the approval of a majority 
of those members present at the meeting.


<R05>
Sec. 690.109  IRB Review of Research.

    (a) An IRB shall review and have authority to approve, require 
modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove all research 
activities covered by this policy.
    (b) An IRB shall require that information given to subjects as part 
of informed consent is in accordance with Sec. 690.116. The IRB may 
require that information, in addition to that specifically mentioned in 
Sec. 690.116, be given to the subjects when in the IRB's judgment the 
information would meaningfully add to the protection of the rights and 
welfare of subjects.
    (c) An IRB shall require documentation of informed consent or may 
waive documentation in accordance with Sec. 690.117.
    (d) An IRB shall notify investigators and the institution in writing 
of its decision to approve or disapprove the proposed research activity, 
or of modifications required to secure IRB approval of the research 
activity. If the IRB decides to disapprove a research activity, it shall 
include in its written notification a statement of the reasons for its 
decision and give the investigator an opportunity to respond in person 
or in writing.
    (e) An IRB shall conduct continuing review of research covered by 
this policy at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less 
than once per year, and shall have authority to observe or have a third 
party observe the consent process and the research.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
9999-0020)


<R05>
Sec. 690.110  Expedited review procedures for certain kinds of research involving no more than minimal risk, and for minor changes in approved research.

    (a) The Secretary, HHS, has established, and published as a Notice 
in the Federal Register, a list of categories of research that may be 
reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure. The list will 
be amended, as appropriate after consultation with other departments and 
agencies, through periodic republication by the Secretary, HHS, in the 
Federal Register. A copy of the list is available from the Office for 
Protection from Research Risks, National Institutes of Health, HHS, 
Bethesda, Maryland 20892.
    (b) An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review either 
or both of the following:
    (1) Some or all of the research appearing on the list and found by 
the reviewer(s) to involve no more than minimal risk,
    (2) Minor changes in previously approved research during the period 
(of

[[Page 232]]

one year or less) for which approval is authorized.

Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by 
the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated 
by the chairperson from among members of the IRB. In reviewing the 
research, the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB 
except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. A research 
activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the 
non-expedited procedure set forth in Sec. 690.108(b).
    (c) Each IRB which uses an expedited review procedure shall adopt a 
method for keeping all members advised of research proposals which have 
been approved under the procedure.
    (d) The department or agency head may restrict, suspend, terminate, 
or choose not to authorize an institution's or IRB's use of the 
expedited review procedure.


<R05>
Sec. 690.111  Criteria for IRB approval of research.

    (a) In order to approve research covered by this policy the IRB 
shall determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied:
    (1) Risks to subjects are minimized: (i) By using procedures which 
are consistent with sound research design and which do not unnecessarily 
expose subjects to risk, and (ii) whenever appropriate, by using 
procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or 
treatment purposes.
    (2) Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated 
benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that 
may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, 
the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result 
from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies 
subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The 
IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying 
knowledge gained in the research (for example, the possible effects of 
the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall 
within the purview of its responsibility.
    (3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment 
the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the 
setting in which the research will be conducted and should be 
particularly cognizant of the special problems of research involving 
vulnerable populations, such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, 
mentally disabled persons, or economically or educationally 
disadvantaged persons.
    (4) Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or 
the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and 
to the extent required by Sec. 690.116.
    (5) Informed consent will be appropriately documented, in accordance 
with, and to the extent required by Sec. 690.117.
    (6) When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for 
monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.
    (7) When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the 
privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.
    (b) When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to 
coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, pregnant 
women, mentally disabled persons, or economically or educationally 
disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included in the 
study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects.


<R05>
Sec. 690.112  Review by institution.

    Research covered by this policy that has been approved by an IRB may 
be subject to further appropriate review and approval or disapproval by 
officials of the institution. However, those officials may not approve 
the research if it has not been approved by an IRB.


<R05>
Sec. 690.113  Suspension or termination of IRB approval of research.

    An IRB shall have authority to suspend or terminate approval of 
research that is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's 
requirements or that has been associated with unexpected serious harm to 
subjects. Any suspension or termination of approval shall include a 
statement of the reasons for the IRB's action and shall be

[[Page 233]]

reported promptly to the investigator, appropriate institutional 
officials, and the department or agency head.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
9999-0020)


<R05>
Sec. 690.114  Cooperative research.

    Cooperative research projects are those projects covered by this 
policy which involve more than one institution. In the conduct of 
cooperative research projects, each institution is responsible for 
safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects and for complying 
with this policy. With the approval of the department or agency head, an 
institution participating in a cooperative project may enter into a 
joint review arrangement, rely upon the review of another qualified IRB, 
or make similar arrangements for avoiding duplication of effort.


<R05>
Sec. 690.115  IRB records.

    (a) An institution, or when appropriate an IRB, shall prepare and 
maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities, including the 
following:
    (1) Copies of all research proposals reviewed, scientific 
evaluations, if any, that accompany the proposals, approved sample 
consent documents, progress reports submitted by investigators, and 
reports of injuries to subjects.
    (2) Minutes of IRB meetings which shall be in sufficient detail to 
show attendance at the meetings; actions taken by the IRB; the vote on 
these actions including the number of members voting for, against, and 
abstaining; the basis for requiring changes in or disapproving research; 
and a written summary of the discussion of controverted issues and their 
resolution.
    (3) Records of continuing review activities.
    (4) Copies of all correspondence between the IRB and the 
investigators.
    (5) A list of IRB members in the same detail as described is 
Sec. 690.103(b)(3).
    (6) Written procedures for the IRB in the same detail as described 
in Sec. 690.103(b)(4) and Sec. 690.103(b)(5).
    (7) Statements of significant new findings provided to subjects, as 
required by Sec. 690.116(b)(5).
    (b) The records required by this policy shall be retained for at 
least 3 years, and records relating to research which is conducted shall 
be retained for at least 3 years after completion of the research. All 
records shall be accessible for inspection and copying by authorized 
representatives of the department or agency at reasonable times and in a 
reasonable manner.

Sec. 690.116  General requirements for informed consent.

    Except as provided elsewhere in this policy, no investigator may 
involve a human being as a subject in research covered by this policy 
unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed 
consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized 
representative. An investigator shall seek such consent only under 
circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative 
sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and 
that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence. The 
information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be 
in language understandable to the subject or the representative. No 
informed consent, whether oral or written, may include any exculpatory 
language through which the subject or the representative is made to 
waive or appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases 
or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution or 
its agents from liability for negligence.
    (a) Basic elements of informed consent. Except as provided in 
paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, in seeking informed consent the 
following information shall be provided to each subject:
    (1) A statement that the study involves research, an explanation of 
the purposes of the research and the expected duration of the subject's 
participation, a description of the procedures to be followed, and 
identification of any procedures which are experimental;
    (2) A description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts 
to the subject;

[[Page 234]]

    (3) A description of any benefits to the subject or to others which 
may reasonably be expected from the research;
    (4) A disclosure of appropriate alternative procedures or courses of 
treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject;
    (5) A statement describing the extent, if any, to which 
confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained;
    (6) For research involving more than minimal risk, an explanation as 
to whether any compensation and an explanation as to whether any medical 
treatments are available if injury occurs and, if so, what they consist 
of, or where further information may be obtained;
    (7) An explanation of whom to contact for answers to pertinent 
questions about the research and research subjects' rights, and whom to 
contact in the event of a research-related injury to the subject; and
    (8) A statement that participation is voluntary, refusal to 
participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the 
subject is otherwise entitled, and the subject may discontinue 
participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which 
the subject is otherwise entitled.
    (b) Additional elements of informed consent. When appropriate, one 
or more of the following elements of information shall also be provided 
to each subject:
    (1) A statement that the particular treatment or procedure may 
involve risks to the subject (or to the embryo or fetus, if the subject 
is or may become pregnant) which are currently unforeseeable;
    (2) Anticipated circumstances under which the subject's 
participation may be terminated by the investigator without regard to 
the subject's consent;
    (3) Any additional costs to the subject that may result from 
participation in the research;
    (4) The consequences of a subject's decision to withdraw from the 
research and procedures for orderly termination of participation by the 
subject;
    (5) A statement that significant new findings developed during the 
course of the research which may relate to the subject's willingness to 
continue participation will be provided to the subject; and
    (6) The approximate number of subjects involved in the study.
    (c) An IRB may approve a consent procedure which does not include, 
or which alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set 
forth above, or waive the requirement to obtain informed consent 
provided the IRB finds and documents that:
    (1) The research or demonstration project is to be conducted by or 
subject to the approval of state or local government officials and is 
designed to study, evaluate, or otherwise examine: (i) Public benefit of 
service programs; (ii) procedures for obtaining benefits or services 
under those programs; (iii) possible changes in or alternatives to those 
programs or procedures; or (iv) possible changes in methods or levels of 
payment for benefits or services under those programs; and
    (2) The research could not practicably be carried out without the 
waiver or alteration.
    (d) An IRB may approve a consent procedure which does not include, 
or which alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set 
forth in this section, or waive the requirements to obtain informed 
consent provided the IRB finds and documents that:
    (1) The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects;
    (2) The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights 
and welfare of the subjects;
    (3) The research could not practicably be carried out without the 
waiver or alteration; and
    (4) Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with 
additional pertinent information after participation.
    (e) The informed consent requirements in this policy are not 
intended to preempt any applicable federal, state, or local laws which 
require additional information to be disclosed in order for informed 
consent to be legally effective.
    (f) Nothing in this policy is intended to limit the authority of a 
physician to provide emergency medical care, to the extent the physician 
is permitted to do

[[Page 235]]

so under applicable federal, state, or local law.

<R05>
Sec. 690.117  Documentation of informed consent.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, informed 
consent shall be documented by the use of a written consent form 
approved by the IRB and signed by the subject or the subject's legally 
authorized representative. A copy shall be given to the person signing 
the form.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the consent 
form may be either of the following:
    (1) A written consent document that embodies the elements of 
informed consent required by Sec. 690.116. This form may be read to the 
subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, but in any 
event, the investigator shall give either the subject or the 
representative adequate opportunity to read it before it is signed; or
    (2) A short form written consent document stating that the elements 
of informed consent required by Sec. 690.116 have been presented orally 
to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. When 
this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. 
Also, the IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to 
the subject or the representative. Only the short form itself is to be 
signed by the subject or the representative. However, the witness shall 
sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person 
actually obtaining consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of 
the summary shall be given to the subject or the representative, in 
addition to a copy of the short form.
    (c) An IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain 
a signed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds either:
    (1) That the only record linking the subject and the research would 
be the consent document and the principal risk would be potential harm 
resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject will be asked 
whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the 
research, and the subject's wishes will govern; or
    (2) That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to 
subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is 
normally required outside of the research context.
    In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived, the IRB 
may require the investigator to provide subjects with a written 
statement regarding the research.

<R05>
Sec. 690.118  Applications and proposals lacking definite plans for involvement of human subjects.

    Certain types of applications for grants, cooperative agreements, or 
contracts are submitted to departments or agencies with the knowledge 
that subjects may be involved within the period of support, but definite 
plans would not normally be set forth in the application or proposal. 
These include activities such as institutional type grants when 
selection of specific projects is the institution's responsibility; 
research training grants in which the activities involving subjects 
remain to be selected; and projects in which human subjects' involvement 
will depend upon completion of instruments, prior animal studies, or 
purification of compounds. These applications need not be reviewed by an 
IRB before an award may be made. However, except for research exempted 
or waived under Sec. 690.101 (b) or (i), no human subjects may be 
involved in any project supported by these awards until the project has 
been reviewed and approved by the IRB, as provided in this policy, and 
certification submitted, by the institution, to the department or 
agency.


<R05>
Sec. 690.119  Research undertaken without the intention of involving human subjects.

    In the event research is undertaken without the intention of 
involving human subjects, but it is later proposed to involve human 
subjects in the research, the research shall first be reviewed and 
approved by an IRB, as provided in this policy, a certification 
submitted, by the institution, to the department or agency, and final 
approval

[[Page 236]]

given to the proposed change by the department or agency.


<R05>
Sec. 690.120  Evaluation and disposition of applications and proposals for research to be conducted or supported by a Federal Department or Agency.

    The department or agency head will evaluate all applications and 
proposals involving human subjects submitted to the department or agency 
through such officers and employees of the department or agency and such 
experts and consultants as the department or agency head determines to 
be appropriate. This evaluation will take into consideration the risks 
to the subjects, the adequacy of protection against these risks, the 
potential benefits of the research to the subjects and others, and the 
importance of the knowledge gained or to be gained.
    (b) On the basis of this evaluation, the department or agency head 
may approve or disapprove the application or proposal, or enter into 
negotiations to develop an approvable one.


<R05>
Sec. 690.121  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 690.122  Use of Federal funds.

    Federal funds administered by a department or agency may not be 
expended for research involving human subjects unless the requirements 
of this policy have been satisfied.


<R05>
Sec. 690.123  Early termination of research support: Evaluation of applications and proposals.

    (a) The department or agency head may require that department or 
agency support for any project be terminated or suspended in the manner 
prescribed in applicable program requirements, when the department or 
agency head finds an institution has materially failed to comply with 
the terms of this policy.
    (b) In making decisions about supporting or approving applications 
or proposals covered by this policy the department or agency head may 
take into account, in addition to all other eligibility requirements and 
program criteria, factors such as whether the applicant has been subject 
to a termination or suspension under paragarph (a) of this section and 
whether the applicant or the person or persons who would direct or has 
have directed the scientific and technical aspects of an activity has 
have, in the judgment of the department or agency head, materially 
failed to discharge responsibility for the protection of the rights and 
welfare of human subjects (whether or not the research was subject to 
federal regulation).


<R05>
Sec. 690.124  Conditions.

    With respect to any research project or any class of research 
projects the department or agency head may impose additional conditions 
prior to or at the time of approval when in the judgment of the 
department or agency head additional conditions are necessary for the 
protection of human subjects.

testimony in executive session.
    (b) The Commission shall afford any persons defamed, degraded, or 
incriminated by such evidence or testimony an opportunity to appear and

time, and place made available for the appearance of witnesses at 
executive session, at least 10 days prior to such date, or where service

mail, or by leaving a copy thereof at the last known residence or 
business address of such person.

day when the material is deposited in the United States mail or is 
delivered in person, as the case may be. When service is made by 
certified mail, the return post office receipt shall be proof of 
service; in all other cases, the acknowledgment of the party served, or 
the verified return of the one making service shall be proof of the

section. In addition, the Commission will receive and dispose of 
requests from such persons to subpena other witnesses. Requests for

afford them an opportunity to appear as voluntary witnesses or to file a

at law admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United 
States, or the highest court of any State or Territory of the United 
States.

<R05>
Sec. 702.11  Special executive session.

recesses or continuances of the public session as it deems necessary 
shall be ordered by the Commission, except that the time and notice 
requirements of Sec. 702.6 may be modified by the Commission provided 
reasonable notice of a scheduled executive session is afforded such 
person, and except that the Commission may, in its discretion, strike 
such evidence from the record, in which case the provisions of

obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;

constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

adjudication, (iii) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy, (iv) disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the

enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by 
an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence 
investigation, confidential information furnished only by the 
confidential source, (v) disclose investigative techniques and 
procedures, or (vi) endanger the life or physical safety of law 
enforcement personnel;
    (8) Disclose information received by the Commission and contained in 
or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, 
on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation 
or supervision of financial institutions;
    (9) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would (i) 
In the case of information received by the Commission from an agency

to close the meeting pursuant to Sec. 702.53(a) to Sec. 702.53(a)(5), 
(6) or (7). The Commission will vote on the request if one Commissioner 
asks that a vote be taken.

reasonable amount of time after the meeting or vote in question is 
publicly announced.

    (a) Purpose, scope, and definitions. (1) This section contains the 
regulations of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights implementing 5 U.S.C. 
552. These regulations inform the public with respect to where and how 
records and information may be obtained from the Commission. Officers 
and employees of the Commission shall make Commission records available 
under 5 U.S.C. 552 only as prescribed in this section. Nothing contained 
in this section, however, shall be construed to prohibit officers or 
employees of the Commission from routinely furnishing information or 
records which are customarily furnished in the regular performance of 
their duties.
    (2) For the purposes of these regulations the terms listed below are 
defined as indicated:
    Commission means the United States Commission on Civil Rights;
    Solicitor means the Solicitor of the United States Commission on 
Civil Rights or his/her designee;
    FOIA Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552;
    FOIA Request means a request in writing, for records pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 552 which meets the requirements of 704.1(d) herein. These 
regulations do not apply to telephone or other oral communications and 
requests not complying with Sec. 704.1(d)(1)(i);
    Staff Director means the Staff Director of the United States 
Commission on Civil Rights.
    (b) General policy. In order to foster the maximum participation of 
an informed public in the affairs of Government, the Commission will 
make the fullest possible disclosure of its identifiable records and 
information consistent with such considerations as those provided in the 
exemptions of 5 U.S.C. 552, which are set forth in paragraph (f) of this 
section.
    (c) Material maintained on file pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). 
Material maintained on file pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) shall be 
available for inspection during regular business hours at the offices of 
the Commission at 1121 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20425. Copies 
of such material shall be available upon written request, specifying the 
material desired, addressed to the Solicitor's Unit, U.S. Commission on 
Civil Rights, Washington, DC 20425, and upon the payment of fees, if 
any, determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (1) Current index. Included in the material available pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 552(a)(2) shall be an index of:
    (i) All other material maintained on file pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552(a)(2); and
    (ii) All material published by the Commission in the Federal 
Register and currently in effect.
    (2) Deletion of identifying details. Wherever deletions from 
material maintained on file pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) are required 
in order to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy, 
justification for the deletions shall be placed as a preamble to 
documents from which such deletions are made.
    (d) Materials available pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3)--(1) Request 
Procedures. (i) Each request for records pursuant to this subsection 
shall be in writing over the signature of the requester, addressed to 
the Solicitor's Unit, U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Washington, DC 
20425 and: (A) Shall clearly and prominently be identified as a request 
for information under the Freedom of Information Act [if submitted by 
mail or otherwise submitted in an envelope or other cover, be clearly 
and prominently identified as such on the envelope or other cover--e.g., 
FOIA]; and (B) shall contain a sufficiently specific description of the 
record requested with respect to names, dates, and subject matter to 
permit such record to be identified and located; and (C) shall contain a 
statement that whatever costs involved pursuant to Sec. 704.1(e) will

[[Page 259]]

be paid, that such costs will be paid up to a specified amount, or that 
waiver or reduction of fees is requested pursuant to Sec. 704.1(e).
    (ii) If the information submitted pursuant to Sec. 704.1(d)(1)(i)(B) 
is insufficient to enable identification and location of the records, 
the Solicitor shall as soon as possible notify the requester in writing 
indicating the additional information needed. Every reasonable effort 
shall be made to assist in the identification and location of the record 
sought. Time requirements under these regulations are tolled from the 
date notification under this subsection is sent to the requester until 
an answer in writing to such notification is received from requester.
    (iii) A request for records which is not in writing or does not 
comply with Sec. 704.1(d)(1)(i) is not a request under the Freedom of 
Information Act and the 10 day time limit for agency response under the 
Act will not be deemed applicable.
    (iv) Except as otherwise provided herein, the Solicitor shall 
immediately notify the requester of noncompliance with 
Sec. 704.1(d)(1)(i)(C) and Sec. 704.1(e).
    (2) Agency determinations. (i) Responses to all requests pursuant to 
5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) shall be made by the Solicitor in writing to the 
requester within 10 working days after receipt by the Solicitor of such 
request except as specifically exempted under Sec. 704.1(d)(1) (ii), 
(iii) and (iv), and shall state: (A) Whether and to what extent the 
Commission will comply with the request; (B) the probable availability 
of the records or that the records may be furnished with deletions or 
that records will be denied as exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (i) 
through (ix); (C) the estimated costs, determined in accordance with 
704.1(e) herein, including waiver or reduction of fee as appropriate and 
any deposit or prepayment requirement; and (D) when records are to be 
provided, the time and place at which records or copies will be 
available determined in accordance with the terms of the request and 
with Sec. 704.1(d)(3). Such response shall be termed a determination 
notice.
    (ii) In the case of denial of requests in whole or part the 
determination notice shall state: (A) Specifically what records are 
being denied; (B) the reasons for such denials; (C) the specific 
statutory exemption(s) upon which such denial is based; (D) the names 
and titles or positions of every person responsible for the denial of 
such request; and (E) the right of appeal to the Staff Director of the 
Commission and procedures for such appeal as provided under 
Sec. 704.1(g).
    (iii) Each request received by the Solicitor's Unit for records 
pursuant to these regulations shall be recorded immediately. The record 
of each request shall be kept current, stating the date and time the 
request is received, the name and address of the person making the 
request, any amendments to such request, the nature of the records 
requested, the action taken regarding the request, including waiver of 
fees, extensions of time pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B), and appeals. 
The date and subject of any letters pursuant to Sec. 704.1(d)(1) or 
agency determinations pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, 
the date(s) any records are subsequently furnished, and the payment 
requested and received.
    (3) Time limitations. (i) Time limitations for agency response to a 
request for records established by these regulations shall begin when 
the request is recorded pursuant to Sec. 704.1(d)(2)(iii). A written 
request pursuant to FOIA but sent to an office of the Commission other 
than the Solicitor's Unit shall be date stamped, initialed and 
redirected immediately to the Solicitor's Unit. The required period for 
agency determination shall begin when it is received by the Solicitor's 
Unit in accordance with Sec. 704.1(d)(2)(iii).
    (ii) In unusual circumstances, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B), 
the Solicitor may, in the case of initial determinations under these 
regulations, extend the 10 working day time limit in which the agency is 
required to make its determination notification. Such extension shall be 
communicated in writing to the requesting party setting forth with 
particularity the reasons for such extension and the date on which a 
determination is expected to be transmitted. Such extensions may not 
exceed 10 working days for any request and may only be used to the 
extent

[[Page 260]]

necessary to properly process a particular request. Such extension is 
permissible only where there is a demonstrated need: (A) To search for 
and collect the requested records from field facilities or other 
establishments that are separate from the Solicitor's Unit; (B) to 
search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of 
separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or 
(C) for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable 
speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the 
determination of the request or among two or more components of the same 
agency having substantial subject matter interest therein.
    (e) Fees--(1) Definitions. The following definitions apply to the 
terms when used in this section:
    (i) Direct costs means those expenditures which the Commission 
actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of 
commercial requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a request made 
under Sec. 704.1(d) of this part. Direct costs include, for example, the 
salary of the employee(s) performing the work (the basic rate of pay for 
the employee(s) plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the 
cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs 
are overhead expenses such as costs of space, and heating or lighting 
the facility in which the records are stored.
    (ii) Search means all time spent looking for material that is 
responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line 
identification within documents. However, an entire document will be 
duplicated if this would prove to be a more efficient and less expensive 
method of complying with a request than a more detailed manner of 
searching. Search is distinguished from review of material in order to 
determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure.
    (iii) Duplication means the process of making a copy of a document 
necessary to respond to a request for disclosure of records. Such copies 
can take the form of paper or machine readable documentation (e.g., 
magnetic tape or disk), among others.
    (iv) Review means the process of examining documents located in 
response to an information request to determine whether any portion of 
any document is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing 
any documents for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to 
prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving 
general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.
    (v) Commercial use request means a request from or on behalf of one 
who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, 
trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose 
behalf the request is made. In deciding whether a requester properly 
belongs in this category, the Solicitor will determine the use to which 
a requester will put the documents requested. When the Solicitor has 
reasonable cause to doubt such intended use, or where such use is not 
clear from the request itself, the Solicitor will see additional 
clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.
    (vi) Educational institution means a school, an institution of 
higher education, an institution of professional education or an 
institution of vocational education, which operates a program or 
programs of scholarly research.
    (vii) Noncommercial scientific institution means an institution that 
is not operated on a commercial basis and which is operated solely for 
the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are 
not intended to promote any particular product or industry.
    (viii) Representative of the news media means any person actively 
gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish 
or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information that is 
about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. 
News media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to 
the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those 
instances when they can qualify as disseminators of ``news'') who make 
their products available for purchase or subscription by the general

[[Page 261]]

public. ``Freelance'' journalists may be regarded as working for a news 
organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting 
publication through that organization, even though not actually employed 
by it.
    (2) Costs to be included in fees. The direct costs included in fees 
will vary according to the following categories of requests:
    (i) Commercial use requests. Fees will include the Commission's 
direct costs for searching for, reviewing, and duplicating the requested 
records.
    (ii) Educational and noncommercial scientific institution requests. 
The Commission will provide documents to requesters in this category for 
the cost of duplication alone, excluding charges for the first 100 
pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must 
show that the request is being made under the auspices of a qualifying 
institution and that the records are sought in furtherance of scholarly 
(if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if 
the request is from a noncommercial scientific institution) research.
    (iii) Requests from representatives of the news media. The 
Commission will provide documents to requesters in this category for the 
cost of duplication alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To 
be eligible for inclusion in this category a requester must meet the 
criteria in paragraph (e)(1)(viii) of this section.
    (iv) All other requests. The Commission will charge requesters who 
do not fit into any of the categories in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through 
(iii) of this section fees which cover the direct costs of searching for 
and duplicating records that are responsive to the requests, except for 
the first two hours of search time and the first 100 pages duplicated. 
However, requests from persons for records about themselves will 
continue to be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 
1974 and Sec. 705.10 of this chapter.
    (3) Fee calculation. Fees will be calculated as follows:
    (i) Manual search. At the salary rate (basic pay plus 16 percent) of 
the employee(s) making the search.
    (ii) Computer search. At the actual direct cost of providing the 
search, including computer search time directly attributable to search 
for records responsive to the request, runs, and operator salary 
apportionable to the search.
    (iii) Review (commercial use requests only). At the salary rate 
(basic pay plus 16 percent) of the employee(s) conducting the review. 
Only the review necessary at the initial administrative level to 
determine the applicability of any exemption, and not review at the 
administrative appeal level, will be included in the fee.
    (iv) Duplication. At 20 cents per page for paper copy. For copies of 
records prepared by computer (such as tapes or printouts), the actual 
cost of production, including operator time, will be charged.
    (v) Additional services; certification. Express mail and other 
additional services that may be arranged by the requester will be 
charged at actual cost. The fee for certification or authentication of 
copies shall be $3.00 per document.
    (vi) Assessment of interest. The Commission may begin assessing 
interest charges on the 31st day following the day the fee bill is sent. 
Interest will be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will 
accrue from the date of billing.
    (vii) No fee shall be charged if the total billable cost calculated 
under paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section is less than $10,00.
    (4) Waiver or reduction of fees. (i) Documents will be furnished 
without charge, or at a reduced charge, where disclosure of the 
information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute 
significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of 
the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the 
requester.
    (ii) Whenever a waiver or reduction of fees is granted, only one 
copy of the record will be furnished.
    (iii) The decision of the Solicitor on any fee waiver or reduction 
request shall be final and unappealable.
    (5) Payment procedures--(i) Fee payment. Payment of fees shall be 
made by cash (if delivered in person), check or money order payable to 
the United States Commission on Civil Rights.

[[Page 262]]

    (ii) Notification of fees. No work shall be done that will result in 
fees in excess of $25.00 without written authorization from the 
requester. Where it is anticipated that fees will exceed $25.00, and the 
requester has not indicated in advance a willingness to pay fees as high 
as are anticipated, the requester will be notified of the amount of the 
projected fees. The notification shall offer the requester an 
opportunity to confer with the Solicitor in an attempt to reformulate 
the request so as to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost. The 
administrative time limits prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) will not 
begin until after the requester agrees in writing to accept the 
prospective charges.
    (6) Advance payment of fees. When fees are projected to exceed 
$250.00, the requester may be required to make an advance payment of all 
or part of the fee before the request is processed. If a requester has 
previously failed to pay a fee in a timely fashion (i.e. within 30 days 
of the billing date), the requester will be required to pay the full 
amount owed plus any applicable interest, and to make an advance payment 
of the full amount of the estimated fee before a new or pending request 
is processed from that requester. The administrative time limits 
prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) will not begin until after the 
requester has complied with this provision.
    (7) Other provisions--(i) Charges for unsuccessful search. Charges 
may be assessed for time spent searching for requested records, even if 
the search fails to locate responsive records or the records are 
determined, after review, to be exempt from disclosure.
    (ii) Aggregating requests to avoid fees. Multiple requests shall be 
aggregated when the Solicitor reasonably determines that a requester or 
group of requesters is attempting to break down a request into a series 
of requests to evade fees.
    (iii) Debt Collection Act. The Debt Collection Act, including 
disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and use of collection 
agencies, will be used to encourage payment where appropriate.
    (f) Exemptions (5 U.S.C. 552(b))--
    (1) General. The Commission may exempt from disclosure matters that 
are:
    (i)(A) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an 
Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or 
foreign policy and (B) are in fact properly classified pursuant to such 
Executive Order.
    (ii) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
an agency;
    (iii) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute;
    (iv) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained 
from a person and privileged or confidential;
    (v) Interagency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not 
be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with 
the agency;
    (vi) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of 
which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy;
    (vii) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, 
but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement 
records or information:
    (A) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement 
proceedings,
    (B) Could deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an 
impartial adjudication,
    (C) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy,
    (D) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a 
confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or 
authority or any private institution which furnished information on a 
confidential basis,
    (E) Could disclose techniques and procedures for all enforcement 
investigations or prosecutions, or could disclose guidelines for law 
enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could 
reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law, or
    (F) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical 
safety of any individual;
    (viii) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or 
condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency 
responsible for the

[[Page 263]]

regulation or supervision of financial institutions; and
    (ix) Geological and geophysical information and data, including 
maps, concerning wells.
    (2) Investigatory records or information. (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)). (i) 
Among the documents exempt from disclosure pursuant to 
Sec. 704.1(f)(1)(vii) shall be records or information reflecting 
investigations which either are conducted for the purpose of determining 
whether a violation(s) of legal right has taken place, or have disclosed 
that a violation(s) of legal right has taken place, but only to the 
extent that production of such records or information would fall within 
the classifications established in paragraphs (f)(1)(vii)(B) through (F) 
of this section.
    (ii) Among the documents exempt from disclosure under 
paragraphs(f)(1)(vii)(D) and (f)(2)(i) of this section concerning 
confidential sources shall be documents which disclose the fact or the 
substance of a communication made to the Commission in confidence 
relating to an allegation or support of an allegation of wrongdoing by 
certain persons. It is sufficient under this subsection to indicate the 
confidentiality of the source if the substance of the communication or 
the circumstances of the communication indicate that investigative 
effectiveness could reasonably be expected to be inhibited by 
disclosure.
    (iii) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records 
described in paragraph (f)(1)(vii)(A) of this section and the 
investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal 
law; and there is reason to believe that the subject of the 
investigation or proceeding is not aware of its pendency, and disclosure 
of the existence of the records could reasonably be expected to 
interfere with enforcement proceedings, the Commission may, during only 
such time as that circumstance continues, treat the records as not 
subject to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552 and this section.
    (3) Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided 
to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions 
which are exempt under this subsection.
    (g) Administrative appeals. (1) These procedures apply whenever a 
requester is denied records under Sec. 704.1(d)(2)(i).
    (2) Parties may appeal Sec. 704.1(d)(2)(i) decisions within 90 days 
of the date of such decision by filing a written request for review 
addressed to the Staff Director, U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 
Washington, DC 20425, by certified mail, including a copy of the written 
denial, and may include a statement of the circumstances, reasons or 
arguments advanced in support of disclosure. Review will be made by the 
Staff Director on the basis of the written record.
    (3) The decision on review of any appeal filed under this subsection 
shall be in writing over the signature of the Staff Director, will be 
promptly communicated to the person requesting review, and will 
constitute the final action of the Commission.
    (4) Determinations of appeals filed under this subsection shall be 
made within 20 working days after the receipt of such appeal. If, on 
appeal, denial of records is in whole or part upheld, the Staff Director 
shall notify the persons making such request of the provisions for 
judicial review of that determination under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4).
    (5) An extension of time may be granted under this subsection 
pursuant to criteria established in Sec. 704.1(d)(3)(ii) (A) to (C), 
except that such extension together with any extension which may have 
been granted pursuant to Sec. 704.1(d)(3)(ii) may not exceed a total of 
10 working days.

Sec. 705.9  Disclosure of records to a person other than the individual to whom the record pertains.

    (a) Any individual who desires to have his or her record disclosed 
to or mailed to a third person may authorize that person to act as his

necessary part of the process of disclosing the record to an individual. 
Fees may be waived or reduced in accordance with Sec. 704.1(e) of the 
Commission's regulations (45 CFR part 704) because of indigency, where 
the cost is nominal, when it is in the public interest not to charge, or 
when waiver would not constitute an unreasonable expense to the 
Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 705.11  Penalties.

    Any person who makes a false statement in connection with any 
request for a record, or in any request for an amendment to a record

or not to disclose the record shall be made by the Solicitor.


<R05>
Sec. 705.13  Exemptions.

    (a) Under the provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k), it has been determined 
by the agency that the following exemptions are necessary and proper and 
may be asserted by the agency:
    (1) Exemption (k)(2) of the Act. Investigatory material compiled for 
law enforcement purposes, other than material within the scope of 
subsection (j)(2) of the Privacy Act: Provided, however, That if any 
individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit that he or she 
would otherwise be eligible for, as a result of the maintenance of such 
material, such material shall be provided to such individual, except to 
the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the 
identify of a

[[Page 269]]

source who furnished information to the Government under an express 
promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, 
prior to the effective date of this section, under an implied promise 
that the identity of the source would be held in confidence.
    (2) Exemption (k)(4) of the Act. Statistical personnel records that 
are used only to generate aggregate data or for other evaluative or 
analytical purposes and which are not used to make decisions on the 
rights, benefits, or entitlements of individuals.
    (3) Exemption (k)(5) of the Act. Investigatory material maintained 
solely for the purposes of determining an individual's qualifications, 
eligibility, or suitability for employment in the Federal civilian 
service, Federal contracts, or access to classified information, but 
only to the extent that disclosure of such material would reveal the 
identity of the source who furnished information to the Government under 
an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in 
confidence, or prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise 
that the identity of the source would be held in confidence.
    (4) Testing or examination material used solely to determine 
individual qualifications for promotion or appointment in the Federal 
service the disclosure of which would compromise the objectivity or 
fairness of the testing or examination process.
    (b) Following are Commission systems of records which are partially 
exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), (4), (5), and (6) and the reasons for 
such exemptions:
    (1) Appeals, Grievances and Complaints (staff)--Commission Project, 
CRC-001. Exempt partially under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2)--The reasons for 
possibly asserting the exemptions are to prevent subjects of 
investigation from frustrating the investigatory process, to prevent 
disclosure of investigative techniques, to maintain the ability to 
obtain necessary information, to fulfill commitments made to sources to 
protect their identities and the confidentiality of information and to 
avoid endangering these sources.
    (2) Complaints, CRC-003--Exempt partially under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). 
The reasons for possibly asserting the exemptions are to prevent 
subjects of investigation from frustrating the investigatory process, to 
prevent disclosure of investigative techniques, to maintain the ability 
to obtain necessary information, to fulfill commitments made to sources 
to protect their identities and the confidentiality of information and 
to avoid endangering these sources.
    (3) Commission projects, CRC-004--Partially exempt under 5 U.S.C. 
552a(k)(a). The reasons for asserting the exemptions are to prevent 
subjects of investigation from frustrating the investigatory process, to 
prevent disclosure of investigative techniques, to maintain the ability 
to obtain necessary information, to fulfill commitments made to sources 
to protect their identities and the confidentiality of information and 
to avoid endangering these sources.
    (4) Other Employee Programs: EEO, Troubled Employee, and Upward 
Mobility, CRC-006--Partially exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(4), (5), and 
(6). The reasons for asserting the exemptions are to maintain the 
ability to obtain candid and necessary information, to fulfill 
commitments made to sources to protect the confidentiality of 
information, to avoid endangering these sources and, primarily, to 
facilitate proper selection or continuance of the best applicants or 
persons for a given position.
    (5) State Advisory Committees Projects, CRC-009--Partially exempt 
under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). The reasons for possibly asserting the 
exemptions are to prevent subjects of investigation from frustrating the 
investigatory process, to prevent disclosure of investigative 
techniques, to maintain the ability to obtain necessary information, to 
fulfill commitments made to sources to protect their identities and the 
confidentiality of information and to avoid endangering these sources.


<R05>
Sec. 705.95  Accounting of the disclosures of records.

    (a) All disclosures of records covered by this part 705, except for 
the exemptions listed in Sec. 705.95(b), shall be accounted for by 
keeping a written

[[Page 270]]

record of the particular record disclosed, the name and address of the 
person or agency to whom or to which disclosed, and the date, nature and 
purpose of the disclosure.
    (b) No accounting is required for disclosures of records to those 
officials and employees of the Commission who have a need for the record 
in the performance of their duties, or if disclosure would be required 
under the Freedom of Information Act. 5 U.S.C. 552.
    (c) The accounting shall be maintained for 5 years or until the 
record is destroyed or transferred to the National Archives and Record 
Service for storage, in which event, the accounting pertaining to those 
records, unless maintained separately, shall be transferred with the 
records themselves.
    (d) The accounting of disclosures may be recorded in any system the 
Commission determines is sufficient for this purpose, however, the 
Commission must be able to construct from its system a listing of all 
disclosures. The system of accounting of disclosures is not a system of 
records under the definition in Sec. 705.2(e) and no accounting need be 
maintained for disclosure of the accounting of disclosures.
    (e) Upon request of an individual to whom a record pertains, the 
accounting of the disclosures of that record shall be made available to 
the requester, provided that he/she has complied with Sec. 705.3(a) and 
with Sec. 705.4(c) or (d).

    An employee of the Commission who violates any of the regulations in

<R05>
Sec. 706.9  Proscribed actions.

    An employee shall avoid any action, whether or not specifically 
prohibited by this subpart, which might result in, or create the 
appearance of:
    (a) Using public office for private gain;
    (b) Giving preferential treatment to any person;
    (c) Impeding Commission efficiency or economy;

[[Page 272]]

    (d) Making a Commission decision outside official channels;
    (e) Losing complete independence or impartiality; or
    (f) Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the 
integrity of the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 706.10  Gifts, entertainment and favors.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (e) of this section, an 
employee shall not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, 
gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of monetary 
value from a person who:
    (1) Has, or is seeking to obtain, contractural or other business or 
financial relations with the Commission;
    (2) Conducts operations or activities that are regulated by the 
Commission; or
    (3) Has interests that may be substantially affected by the 
performance or nonperformance of the employee's official duty.
    (b) Exceptions from the prohibitions contained in paragraph (a) of 
this section are as follows:
    (1) Gifts, entertainment and favors which derive from family or 
personal relationships (such as those between parents, children, or 
spouse of the employee and the employee) when the circumstances make it 
clear that it is those relationships rather than the business of the 
persons concerned which are the motivating factors;
    (2) Acceptance of food and refreshments of nominal value on 
infrequent occasions in the ordinary course of a luncheon or dinner 
meeting or other meeting or on an inspection tour where an employee may 
properly be in attendance;
    (3) Aceptance of loans from banks or other financial institutions on 
customary terms to finance proper and usual activities of employees, 
such as home mortgage loans; and
    (4) Acceptance of unsolicited advertising or promotional material, 
such as pens, pencils, note pads, calendars, and other items of nominal 
intrinsic value.
    (c) Employees shall not solicit a contribution from another employee 
for a gift to an official superior, make a donation as a gift to an 
official superior, or accept a gift from an employee receiving less pay 
than themselves. This paragraph, however, does not prohibit a voluntary 
gift of nominal value or donation in a nominal amount made on a special 
occasion such as marriage, illness, or retirement.
    (d) An employee shall not accept a gift, present, decoration, or 
other thing from a foreign government unless authorized by Congress as 
provided by the Constitution and 5 U.S.C. 7342.
    (e) Neither this section nor Sec. 706.11 precludes an employee from 
receipt of bona fide reimbursement, unless prohibited by law, for 
expenses of travel and such other necessary subsistence as is compatible 
with this part, for which no Government payment or reimbursement is 
made. This paragraph, however, does not allow employees to be 
reimbursed, or payment to be made on their behalf, for excessive 
personal living expenses, gifts, entertainment or other personal 
benefits.


<R05>
Sec. 706.11  Proscribed outside employment and other activities.

    (a) An employee shall not engage in outside employment or other 
outside activity not compatible with the full and proper discharge of 
the duties and responsibilities of Government employment. Incompatible 
activities include but are not limited to:
    (1) Acceptance of a fee, compensation, gift, payment of expense, or 
any other thing of monetary value in circumstances in which acceptance 
may result in, or create the appearance of conflicts of interest; or
    (2) Outside employment which tends to impair mental or physical 
capacity to perform Governmental duties and responsibilities in an 
acceptable manner.
    (b) An employee shall not receive any salary or anything of monetary 
value from a private source as compensation for service to the 
Government as prohibited by 18 U.S.C. 209.
    (c) Employees are encouraged to engage in teaching, lecturing, and 
writing that is not prohibited by law, the Executive order, or 
Commission regulations. An employee shall not, either for or without 
compensation, engage in teaching, lecturing, or writing, including 
teaching, lecturing, or writing for the purpose of the special 
preparation

[[Page 273]]

of a person or class of persons for an examination of the Office of 
Personnel Management or Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service, that 
depends on information obtained as a result of Government employment, 
except when that information has been made available to the general 
public or will be made available on request, or when the agency head 
gives written authorization for use of nonpublic information on the 
basis that the use is in the public interest. In addition, an employee 
who is a Presidential appointee covered by section 401(a) of the order 
shall not receive compensation or anything of monetary value for any 
consultation, lecture, discussion, writing, or appearance the subject 
matter of which is devoted substantially to the responsibilities, 
programs, or operations of the Commission or which draws substantially 
on official data or ideas which have not become part of the body of 
public information.
    (d) This section does not preclude an employee from:
    (1) Participation in the activities of national or State political 
parties not proscribed by law;
    (2) Participation in the affairs of or acceptance of an award for a 
meritorious public contribution or achievement given by a charitable, 
religious, professional, social, fraternal, nonprofit educational and 
recreational public service, or civic organization; or
    (3) Outside employment permitted under these regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 706.12  Financial interests.

    (a) Employees shall not:
    (1) Have a direct or indirect financial interest that conflicts 
substantially, or appears to conflict substantially, with their 
Government duties and responsibilities; or
    (2) Engage in, directly or indirectly, a financial transaction as a 
result of, or primarily relying on, information obtained through their 
Government employment.
    (b) This section does not preclude an employee from having a 
financial interest or engaging in financial transactions to the same 
extent as a private citizen not employed by the Government, so long as 
it is not prohibited by law, the Executive order, or Commission 
regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 706.13  Use of Government property.

    Employees shall not directly or indirectly use, or allow the use of, 
Government property of any kind, including property leased to the 
Government, for other than officially approved activities. Employees 
have a positive duty to protect and conserve Government property, 
including equipment, supplies, and other property entrusted or issued 
them.


<R05>
Sec. 706.14  Misuse of information.

    For the purpose of furthering a private interest, employees shall 
not directly or indirectly use, or allow the use of, official 
information obtained through or in connection with their Government 
employment, which has not been made available to the general public.


<R05>
Sec. 706.15  Indebtedness.

    An employee shall pay each just financial obligation in a proper and 
timely manner, especially one imposed by law such as Federal, State, or 
local taxes. For the purpose of this section, a ``just financial 
obligation'' means one acknowledged by the employee or reduced to 
judgment by a court, and ``in a proper and timely manner'' means in a 
manner which the agency determines does not, under the circumstances, 
reflect adversely on the Government as the employer. In the event of 
dispute between an employee and an alleged creditor, this section does 
not require the Commission to determine the validity or amount of the 
disputed debt.


<R05>
Sec. 706.16  Gambling, betting and lotteries.

    Employees shall not participate while on Government-owned or leased 
property or while on duty for the Government, in any gambling activity 
including the operation of a gambling device, in conducting a lottery or 
pool, in a game for money or property, or in selling or purchasing a 
numbers slip or ticket.

[[Page 274]]


<R05>
Sec. 706.17  General conduct prejudicial to the Government.

    Employees shall not engage in criminal, infamous, dishonest, 
immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct, or other conduct 
prejudicial to the Government.

than the rate for GS-16 (step 1);
    (b) Employees in the excepted service in positions which are of a 
confidential or policy-making character, unless their positions have 
been excluded by the Director of the Office of Government Ethics; and
    (c) Each designated agency ethics official.

[[Page 275]]


<R05>
Sec. 706.20  Time and place for filing of reports.

    (a) Annual reports are to be filed no later than May 15 of each

a covered position in another agency, must file a report within 30 days 
after assuming the position at the Commission. In the event an 
individual terminates employment with the Commission and does not accept 
another position for which reporting is required, the report must be 
filed no later than the 30th day after termination, covering:
    (1) The preceding calendar year if the annual May 15 report has not 
been filed; and
    (2) The portion of the present calendar year up to the date of

agency programs or policies. Such persons may include chauffeurs, 
private secretaries, stenographers and those who hold positions of 
similar nature, consistent with the basic criterion set forth in the 
preceding sentence.

appropriate. Reports are to be reviewed within 60 days after the date of 
their filing or transmittal to the Office of Government Ethics.
    (b) After reviewing a report, the reviewing official is required to:
    (1) State upon the report that the reporting individual is in 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to sign the report;
    (2) Notify the reporting individual that additional information is 
required to be submitted and the time by which it must be submitted; or
    (3) Notify the reporting individual that the report indicates

    (c) If the reviewing official determines that the reporting 
individual is not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations,

not be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the 
designated Commission ethics official is to maintain a list of those 
circumstances or situations which have resulted or may result in 
noncompliance and the lists are to be periodically published and

enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by 
others receiving the aid, benefit, or service.
    (2) The Agency shall not deny a qualified individual with handicaps 
the opportunity to participate in programs or activities that are not 
separate or different, despite the existence of permissibly separate or 
different programs or activities.
    (3) The Agency shall not, directly or through contractual or other 
arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration the purpose 
or effect of which would--
    (i) Subject qualified individuals with handicaps to discrimination 
on the basis of handicap; or
    (ii) Defeat or substantially impair accomplishment of the objectives 
of a program or activity, with respect to individuals with handicaps.
    (4) The Agency shall not, in determining the site or location of a 
facility or activity make selections the purpose or effect of which

this part.
    (d) The Agency shall administer programs and activities in the most 
integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals 
with handicaps.


<R05>
Sec. 707.7  Employment.

    No qualified individual with handicaps shall, on the basis of 
handicap, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any program 
or activity conducted by the Agency. The definitions, requirements, and 
procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 
791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 
29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in programs or activities 
conducted by the Agency.


<R05>
Sec. 707.8  Physical access.

    (a) Discrimination prohibited. Except as otherwise provided in this 
section, no qualified individual with handicaps shall, because the 
Agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with 
handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, 
or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or 
activity conducted by the Agency.
    (b) Existing facilities-program access--(1) Existing facilities 
defined. For the purpose of this section, ``existing facilities'' means 
those facilities owned, leased or used through some other arrangement by 
the Agency on March 28, 1990.

[[Page 280]]

    (2) General. The Agency shall operate each program or activity 
conducted in an existing facility so that the program or activity, when 
viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. This paragraphs does not--
    (i) Necessarily require the Agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps.
    (ii) Require the Agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where Agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the Agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with this paragraph would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the Staff Director or his or her 
designee after considering all Agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the Agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.
    (3) Methods. (i) The Agency may comply with the requirements of this 
section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of 
services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to individuals 
with handicaps, delivery of services at alternative accessible sites, 
alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, 
use of accessible vehicles, or any other methods that result in making 
its program or activities readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps.
    (ii) The Agency is not required to make structural changes in 
existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving 
compliance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The Agency, in making 
alterations to existing buildings to achieve program accessibility, 
shall meet accessibility requirements imposed by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), as 
established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607.
    (iii) In choosing among available methods for meeting the 
requirements of this section, the Agency shall give priority to those 
methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with 
handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of 
qualified individuals with handicaps.
    (4) Time period for compliance. The Agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section within sixty days of the 
effective date of this part, except that where structural changes in 
facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made within three years 
of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (5) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
Agency shall develop, within 6 months of the effective date of this 
part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete 
such changes. The Agency shall provide an opportunity to interested 
persons, including individuals with handicaps and organizations 
representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the 
development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and 
written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for 
public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (i) Identify physical obstacles in the Agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (ii) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (iii) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this paragraph and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than 1 year, identify steps that

[[Page 281]]

will be taken during each year of the transition period; and
    (iv) Indicate the official response for implementation of the plan.
    (6) The Agency shall provide signs at a primary entrance to each of 
its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they 
can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international 
symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an 
accessible facility.
    (c) New purchases, leases or other arrangements. (1) Any building or 
facility acquired after March 28, 1990, whether by purchase, lease 
(other than lease renewal), or any other arrangement, shall be readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps.
    (2) Nothing in this paragraph requires the Agency to take any action 
that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where Agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the Agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with this paragraph would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Staff Director 
or his or her designee after considering all Agency resources available 
for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or 
activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons 
for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an 
alteration or such burdens, the Agency shall take any other action that 
would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would 
nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits 
and services of the program or activity.
    (d) New construction and alterations. Each building or part of a 
building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use 
of the Agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be 
readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps in 
accordance with the requirements imposed by the Architectural Barriers 
Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), as established in 
41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607.


<R05>
707.9  Access to communications.

    (a) Discrimination prohibited. Except as otherwise provided in this 
section, no qualified individual with handicaps shall, because the 
Agency's communications are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals 
with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from 
participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any 
program or activity conducted by the Agency.
    (b) The Agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (c) Specific requirements regarding oral communications--(1) 
Telecommunications devices for deaf persons. (i) The Agency headquarters 
and each regional office shall maintain and reliably answer at least one 
telecommunications device for deaf persons (TDD) or equally effective 
telecommunications device.
    (ii) The Agency shall ensure that all Agency letterhead, forms, and 
other documents listing any Agency telephone number list the appropriate 
TDD numbers.
    (2) Interpreter service. (i) The Agency shall establish a reliable 
system for the provision of qualified interpreters to individuals with 
handicaps for Agency programs or activities. This provision does not 
require the Agency to have an interpreter on staff, but does require the 
Agency to be able to provide a qualified interpreter on reasonable 
notice.
    (ii) Notice of the availability of interpreter service shall be 
included in all announcements notifying the public of Agency activities 
to which the public is invited or which it is permitted to attend, 
including but not limited to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights' 
meetings, consultations, hearings, press conferences and State Advisory 
Committee conferences and meetings. This notice shall designate the 
Agency official(s) and the address, telephone and TDD number to call to 
request interpreter services.

[[Page 282]]

    (d) Specific requirements for printed communications. (1) The Agency 
shall establish a system to provide to individuals with handicaps 
appropriate reader or taping service for all Agency publications which 
are available to the public. This provision does not require the Agency 
to have a reader or taper or staff, but does require the Agency to be 
able to provide appropriate reader or taping service within a reasonable 
time and on reasonable notice. The Agency shall effectively notify 
qualified individuals with handicaps of the availability of reader or 
taping services.
    (2) Notice of the availability of reader or taping service shall be 
included in all publications which are available to the public. This 
notice shall designate the Agency official(s) and the address, telephone 
and TDD number to call to request interpreter services.
    (e) Nothing in this section or Sec. 707.10 requires the Agency to 
take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental 
alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial 
and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where Agency 
personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the 
program or activity or would result in undue financial and 
administrative burdens, the Agency has the burden of proving that 
compliance with this section or Sec. 707.10 would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the Staff Director or his or her 
designee after considering all Agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompaned by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action required to comply with this paragraph would 
result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Agency shall take any 
other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens 
but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.


<R05>
Sec. 707.10  Auxiliary aids.

    (a) The Agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the Agency.
    (b) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
Agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (c) The Agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.


<R05>
Sec. 707.11  Eliminating discriminatory qualifications and selection criteria.

    The Agency shall not make use of any qualification standard, 
eligibility requirement, or selection criterion that excludes particular 
classes of individuals with handicaps from an Agency program or activity 
merely because the persons are handicapped, without regard to an 
individual's actual ability to participate. An irrebuttable presumption 
of inability to participate based upon a handicap shall be permissible 
only if the condition would, in all instances, prevent an individual 
from meeting the essential eligibility requirements for participating 
in, or receiving the benefits of, the particular program or activity.


<R05>
Sec. 707.12  Compliance procedures.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this 
section applies to all allegations of discrimination on the basis of 
handicap in programs or activities conducted by the Agency.
    (b) The Agency shall process complaints alleging violations of 
section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1613 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 
U.S.C. 791).
    (c) Responsibility for implementation and operation of this section 
shall be vested in the Office of General Counsel.
    (d) The Agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints 
for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed 
within 180

[[Page 283]]

days of the alleged act of discrimination. The Agency may extend this 
time period for good cause.
    (e) If the Agency receives a complaint over which it does not have 
jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government 
entity.
    (f) The Agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), is not readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps.
    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which 
it has jurisdiction, the Agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the investigation in a letter containing--
    (1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;
    (2) A description of a remedy for each violation found; and
    (3) A notice of the right to appeal.
    (h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or 
remedies must be filed by the complainant within 90 days of receipt from 
the Agency of the letter required by Sec. 707.12(g). The Staff Director 
may extend this time for good cause.
    (i) Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the Staff 
Director or the Staff Director's designee.
    (j) The Agency shall notify the complainant in writing of the 
results of the appeal within 60 days of the receipt of the request. If 
the head of the Agency determines that additional information is needed 
from the complainant, it shall have 60 days from the date it receives 
the additional information to make its determination on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (d), (g), (h), and (j) of 
this section may be extended for an individual case when the Staff 
Director determines that there is good cause, based on the particular 
circumstances of that case, for the extension.
    (l) The Agency may delegate its authority for conducting complaint 
investigations to other Federal agencies, except that the authority for 
making the final determination may not be delegated to another Agency.

longer than sixty (60) days from the proceedings if an extension has 
been granted pursuant to Sec. 708.5(b)(10).

<R05>
Sec. 708.9  Coordinating offset with another Federal agency.

    (a) The Commission is the creditor agency when the Assistant Staff 
Director for Management determines that an employee of another Federal 
agency owes a delinquent debt to the Commission. The Assistant Staff 
Director for Management shall, as appropriate:
    (1) Arrange for a hearing upon the proper petitioning by the 
employee;
    (2) Certify in writing that the employee of the paying agency owes 
the debt, the amount, and basis of the debt, the date on which payment 
is due, the date the Government's right to collect the debt first 
accrued, and that the Commission's regulations for salary offset have 
been approved by the Office of Personnel Management;
    (3) If the collection must be made in installments, the Commission, 
as the creditor agency, will advise the paying agency of the amount or 
percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment and the 
number and the commencement date of the installments;
    (4) Advise the paying agency of the actions taken under 5 U.S.C. 
5514(a) and provide the dates on which action

[[Page 287]]

was taken, unless the employee has consented to salary offset in writing 
or signed a statement acknowledging receipt of procedures required by 
law. The written consent or acknowledgement must be sent to the paying 
agency;
    (5) If the employee is in the process of separating, the Commission 
will submit its debt claim to the paying agency as provided in this 
part. The paying agency must certify any amounts already collected, 
notify the employee, and send a copy of the certification of the monies 
already collected and notice of the employee's separation to the 
Commission. If the paying agency is aware that the employee is entitled 
to Civil Service or Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund or 
similar payments, it must provide written notification to the agency 
responsible for making such payments stating the amount of the debt and 
indicating that the provisions of this part have been followed; and
    (6) If the employee has already separated and all payments due from 
the paying agency have been paid, the Assistant Staff Director for 
Management may request, unless otherwise prohibited, that money payable 
to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or 
other similar funds be collected by administrative offset. The 
Commission will provide the agency responsible for these payments with a 
properly certified claim.
    (b) The Commission is the paying agency when an employee of this 
agency owes a debt to another Federal agency which is the creditor 
agency.
    (1) Upon receipt of a properly certified debt claim from a creditor 
agency, deductions will be scheduled to begin at the next established 
pay interval.
    (2) The Commission must give the employee written notice that it has 
received a certified debt claim from a creditor agency (including the 
amount), and the date that deductions will be scheduled to begin and the 
amount of the deduction.
    (3) The Commission shall not review the merits of the creditor 
agency's determination of the amount of the certified claim or of its 
validity.
    (4) If the employee transfers to another paying agency after the 
creditor agency has submitted its debt claim but before the debt is 
collected completely, the Commission must certify the total amount 
collected to the creditor agency with notice of the employee's transfer. 
One copy of this certification must be furnished to the employee. The 
creditor agency will submit a properly certified claim to the new paying 
agency before collection can be resumed.
    (5) When the Commission, as a paying agency, receives an incomplete 
debt claim from a creditor agency, it must return the debt claim with a 
notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this subpart must be 
provided and a properly certified debt claim received before action will 
be taken to collect from the employee's current pay account.


<R05>
Sec. 708.10  Procedures for salary offset.

    (a) Deductions to liquidate an employee's debt will be by the method 
and in the amount stated in the Assistant Staff Director for 
Management's written notice of intent to collect from the employee's 
current pay, unless alternative arrangements for repayment are made.
    (b) If the employee filed a petition for a hearing with the 
Assistant Staff Director for Management before the expiration of the 
period provided, then deductions will begin after the hearing official 
has provided the employee with a hearing, and a final written decision 
has been rendered in favor of the Commission.
    (c) A debt will be collected in a lump-sum if possible.
    (d) If an employee is financially unable to pay in one lump sum or 
the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of disposable pay for an 
officially established pay interval, collection must be made in 
installments. The size of the installment deduction(s) will bear a 
reasonable relationship to the size of the debt and the deduction will 
be established for a period not greater than the anticipated period of 
employment. The deduction for the pay intervals for any period must not 
exceed 15% of disposable pay unless the employee has agreed in writing 
to a deduction of a

[[Page 288]]

greater amount. If possible, the installment payment will be sufficient 
in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in no more than three years.
    (e) Installment payments may be less than 15 percent of disposable 
pay if the Assistant Staff Director for Management determines that the 
15 percent deduction would create an extreme financial hardship.
    (f) Installment payments of less than $25.00 per pay period or 
$50.00 per month, will only be accepted in the most unusual 
circumstances.
    (g) Unliquidated debts may be offset by the paying agency under 31 
U.S.C. 3716 against any financial payment due to a separating employee 
including but not limited to final salary payment, retired pay, or lump 
sum leave, etc. as of the date of separation to the extent necessary to 
liquidate the debt.
    (h) If the debt cannot be liquidated by offset from any final 
payment due a separated employee it may be recovered by the offset in 
accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716 from any later payments due the former 
employee from the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 708.11  Refunds.

    (a) The Commission will refund promptly any amounts deducted to 
satisfy debts owned to the Commission when the debt is waived, found not 
owed to the Commission, or when directed by an administrative or 
judicial order; or
    (b) The creditor agency will promptly return any amounts deducted 
and forwarded by the Commission to satisfy debts owed to the creditor 
agency when the debt is waived, found not owed, or when directed by an 
administrative or judicial order;
    (c) Upon receipt of monies returned in accordance with paragraph (b) 
of this section, the Commission will refund the amount to the current or 
former employee.
    (d) Unless required by law, refunds under this subsection shall not 
bear interest nor shall liability be conferred to the Commission for 
debt or refunds owed by other creditor agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 708.12  Statute of limitations.

    If a debt has been outstanding for more than 10 years after the 
agency's right to collect the debt first accrued, the agency may not 
collect by salary offset unless facts material to the government's right 
to collect were not known and could not reasonably have been known by 
the official or officials who were charged with the responsibility for 
discovery and collection of such debts.


<R05>
Sec. 708.13  Non-waiver of rights by payments.

    An employee's involuntary payment of all or any part of a debt 
collected under these regulations will not be construed as a waiver of 
any rights that employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any other 
provision of contract or law unless there are statutory or contractual 
provisions to the contrary.


<R05>
Sec. 708.14  Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.

    Charges may be assessed for interest, penalties, and administrative 
costs in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 4 CFR 
102.13.

Louisiana if:
    (1) He is no longer a legal resident of the State of Louisiana or 
the parish for which he is listed, however, the removal from one parish 
to another does not deprive a person of the right to remain listed in 
the parish from which he has removed for the purpose of voting for 
district officers to be elected in a district which includes the parish 
to which he has removed, or for State officers, whether the parish is in 
the same district or not, until he has acquired the right to register or 
be listed and vote for such officers in the parish to which he has

parish from which he has removed until three months after the removal);

    (3)(a) He is convicted of any crime punishable by imprisonment in 
the penitentiary and has not been subsequently pardoned with the express

taxes due the municipality for the two preceding years. Loss of 
eligibility to vote in a municipal election because of change of such 
residence or such conviction or such default in taxes does not result in 
loss of eligibility in any other election.

South Carolina.
    A person loses his eligibility to vote in municipal elections only

residence does not result in a loss of eligibility in any other 
election.
    (7) He fails to register in accordance with State law requiring 
general registration of all previously registered voters every 10th 
year. However, he does not lose his eligibility to vote if he has

registration was by listing by an Examiner.

Sec. 1080.7  Funding of Indian tribes.

    (a) Not less than 1.5 percent of the funds provided in each fiscal 
year for the Emergency Community Services Homeless Grant Program shall 
be allocated by the Secretary directly to Indian tribes that have 
applied for and received a direct grant award under section 674(c) of 
the Community Services Block Grant Act (41 U.S.C. 9903(c)) for that 
fiscal year.
    (b) An Indian tribe funded under this section is not required to 
submit an application for Emergency Community Services Homeless Grant

section 674(c) of the Community Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 
9903(c)) that is submitted by September 1 for the succeeding fiscal year 
will be considered as an application for Emergency Community Services 
Homeless Grant Program funds for that fiscal year. Acceptance of the 
Community Services Block Grant application by the Office of Community 
Services will constitute approval of an award of funds under this 
section.
    (c) Funds allocated under this section shall be allotted to an 
Indian tribe in an amount that bears the same ratio to all the funds 
allocated under this section as the tribe's poverty population bears to 
the total poverty population of all tribes funded under this section, 
except that no tribe shall receive an amount of less than:
    (1) $500, for those tribes whose allocation under this section would 
otherwise be at least $1 but no more than $500; or
    (2) $1000, for those tribes whose allocation under this section 
would otherwise be at least $501 but less than $1000.
    (d) For purposes of this section, an Indian tribe's poverty 
population shall be calculated by multiplying the tribe's overall 
population by the Indian rural poverty rate for the State in which it is 
located, using the population and rural poverty rate figures established 
for the purposes of making direct grants under section 674(c) of the 
Community Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9903(c)).


<R05>
Sec. 1080.8  Reporting requirements.

    Each recipient of funds under the Emergency Community Services 
Homeless Grant Program shall submit an annual report to the Secretary, 
within 6 months of the end of the period covered by the report, on the 
expenditure of funds and the implementation of the program for that 
fiscal year.
    (a) The report is to state the types of activities funded, any 
efforts undertaken by the grantee and its subgrantees to coordinate 
homeless activities funded under this program with other homeless 
assistance activities in the State and communities, the number of 
individuals served and any impediments, including statutory and 
regulatory restrictions to homeless individuals' use of the program and 
to their obtaining services or benefits under the program.
    (b) Such annual report shall provide information on the use of funds 
to defray State administrative costs, including the types of activities 
which specifically address services to the homeless and also those 
activities that are related to the administrative costs associated with 
the coordination and integration of services to the homeless.
    (c) States shall also provide information in the annual report which 
details programs, progress, and activities that are specifically related 
to expenditures for renovation, including the effects of such activities 
on historic properties,

[[Page 317]]

and the provision of, or referral to, services for domestic violence.

(Information collection requirements are approved by the Office of 
Management and Budget under control number 0970-0088)

a requestor will put the document. Where the agency has reasonable cause 
to doubt the use to which a requestor will put the records sought or the 
use is not clear from the request, the agency may seek additional 
clarification. The requestor fears the burden of demonstrating the use 
or purpose of the information requested.
    (c) Direct costs mens those expenditures which an agency actually 
incurs in searching for and duplication documents to respond to a 
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. In the case of commercial use 
requests, the term shall also include expenditures for reviewing

    (g) Representative of the news media means any person actively 
gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish 
or broadcast information that is about current events or that would be

<R05>
Sec. 1100.4  Current index.

    Each agency shall maintain and make available for public inspection 
and copying a current index providing identifying information for the 
public as to any matter which is issued, adopted, or promulgated and 
which is required to be made available pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a) (1) 
and (2). Publication and distribution of such indices has been 
determined by the Foundation to be unnecessary and impracticable. The 
indices will be provided upon request at a cost not to exceed the direct 
cost of the duplication.


<R05>
Sec. 1100.5  Agency procedures for handling requests for documents.

    (a) Upon receiving a request for documents in accordance with the 
rules of this part, the General Counsel of the National Endowment for 
the Arts, Deputy Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, 
or the Public Affairs Officer of the Institute of Museum Services, as is 
appropriate, shall determine whether or not the request shall be granted 
in whole or in part.

[[Page 323]]

    (1) The determination shall be made within ten (10) days (excepting 
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after receipt of such request.
    (2) The requestor shall be notified of the determination and the 
reasons that support it. When a request is denied in whole or in part, 
the requestor, will be notified of his or her rights to appeal the 
determination to the head of the agency.
    (b)(1) Any party whose request for documents has been denied in 
whole or in part may file an appeal no later than ten (10) working days 
following receipt of the notification of denial. Appeals must be 
addressed to the Chairman, National Endowment for the Arts, Washington, 
DC 20506, the Chairman, National Endowment for the Humanities, 
Washington, DC 20506, or the Director Institute of Museum Services, 
Washington, DC 20506, as is appropriate.
    (2) The head of the agency or his delegatee shall make a 
determination with respect to the appeal within twenty (20) days 
(excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the agency has 
received the appeal, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section. If, on appeal, the denial is upheld either in whole or in part, 
the head of the agency shall notify the party submitting the appeal of 
the judicial review provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B).
    (c) In unusual circumstances, the time limits prescribed to 
determine a request for documents with respect to initial actions or 
actions on appeal may be extended by written notice from the General 
Counsel of the National Endowment for the Arts, the Deputy Chairman of 
the National Endowment for the Humanities, or the Public Affairs Officer 
of the Institute of Museum Services as is appropriate. The notice shall 
describe the reason for the extension and the date on which the 
determination is expected to be made. No notice shall specify a date 
that would result in an extension of more than ten (10) days (excepting 
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays). As is used in this paragraph, 
unusual circumstances means:
    (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
office processing the request;
    (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
volumious amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in 
a single request; or
    (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in 
the determination of the request or among two or more components of the 
agency having a substantial subject-matter interest in the request.


<R05>
Sec. 1100.6  Fees.

    (a) Categories of fees. Fees will be charged according to the 
Category of the FOIA request.
    (1) Commercial use requests. The agency will assess charges to 
recover the full direct cost of searching for, reviewing, and 
duplicating the requested document. The agency may recover the cost of 
searching for and reviewing records even if there is ultimately no 
disclosure.
    (2) Requests from educational and non-commercial scientific 
institutions. The agency will charge for duplication costs. To qualify 
for this category the requestor must show: (i) That requested records 
are being sought under the auspices of a qualified institution as 
defined in Sec. 1100.1 (e) or (f) of this part; (ii) the records are not 
sought for commercial use; and (iii) the records are being sought in 
furtherance of scholarly or scientific research of the institution.
    (3) Requests by representatives of the news media. The agency will 
charge duplication costs for the requests in this category.
    (4) All other requests. All other requests shall be charged fees 
which, recover the full reasonable cost for searching for and 
duplicating the requested records.
    (b) General fee schedule. The agency shall use the most efficient 
and least costly method to comply with requests for documents made under 
the FOIA. The agency will charge fees to recover all allowable direct 
costs incurred. The agency may charge fees for searching for and 
reviewing requested documents even if the documents are determined

[[Page 324]]

to be exempt from disclosure or cannot be located. If search charges are 
likely to exceed $25, the agency shall notify the requestor, unless the 
requestor has indicated in advance the willingness to pay higher fees. 
The following fees shall be charged in accordance with paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (1) Searches--(i) Manual. The fee charged will be the salary rate(s) 
(i.e., basic pay plus 16.1 percent) of the employee(s) conducting the 
search.
    (ii) Computer. The fee charged will be the actual direct cost of 
providing the service including the cost of operating the central 
processing unit for the operating time that is directly attributed to 
searching for records responsive to a request and the operator/
programmer salary apportionable to the search.
    (2) Review. The fee charged will equal the salary rate(s) (basic pay 
plus 16.1 percent) of the employee(s) conducting the review.
    (3) Duplication. Copies of documents photocopied on one-side of a 
8\1/2\ x 11 inch sheet of paper will be provided at $.10 per page. 
Photocopies on two sides of a single 8\1/2\ x 11 inch sheet of paper 
will be provided at $.20 per page. For duplication of other materials, 
the charge will be the direct cost of duplication.
    (c) Restrictions on charging fees. (1) Except for documents provided 
in response to a commercial use request, the first 100 pages of 
duplication or the first two (2) hours of search time shall be provided 
at no charge. For the purposes of this section, two (2) hours of search 
time by computer entitles the requestor to two (2) hours of computer 
operator salary translated into computer search costs. Computer search 
costs consist of operator salary plus central proceeding unit operating 
time costs for the duration of the search.
    (2) Fees shall not be charged to any requestor, including commercial 
use requestors, if the cost of collecting a fee would be equal to or 
greater than the fee itself.
    (d) Waiver or reduction of fees. (1) Documents shall be furnished 
without charge or at reduced charge if disclosure of the information is 
in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly 
to public understanding of the operations or activities of the 
government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the 
requestor.
    (2) The following factors shall be used to determine whether a fee 
will be waived or reduced:
    (i) The subject of the request. Whether the subject of the requested 
records concerns ``the operations or activities of the government'';
    (ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed. 
Whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding 
of government operations or activities;
    (iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the 
general public likely to result from disclosure. Whether disclosure of 
the requested information will contribute to ``public understanding'';
    (iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding. 
Whether disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to public 
understanding of government operations or activities;
    (v) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest. Whether 
the requestor has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the 
disclosure; and if so
    (vi) The primary interest in disclosure. Whether the magnitude of 
the identified commercial interest of the requestor is sufficiently 
large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that 
disclosure is ``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.''
    (e) Assessment and collection of fees. (1) Interest will accrue from 
the date the bill is mailed if the fee is not paid within thirty (30) 
days. Interest will be assessed at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 
3717.
    (2) If the agency reasonably believes that a requestor(s) is making 
multiple requests to avoid the assessment of fees, the agency may 
aggregate such requests and charge accordingly.
    (3) The agency may request an advance payment of the fee if
    (i) The allowable charges are likely to exceed $250; or
    (ii) The requestor has failed previously to pay a fee in a timely 
fashion.
    (4) When the agency requests an advance payment, the time limits 
prescribed in section (a)(6) of the Freedom

[[Page 325]]

of Information Act will begin only after the agency has received full 
payment.


<R05>

Sec. 1105.735-1  Purpose.

    While confident of the integrity and sense of responsibility of the

[38 FR 3511, Feb. 7, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 1105.735-4  Statutory provisions.

    Each employee is responsible for acquainting himself not only with 
the provisions of this part, but also with applicable portions of each 
Federal statute relating to his conduct as an employee of the National 
Endowment for the Arts or the National Endowment for the Humanities and 
of the U.S. Government. This part will be called to the attention of all 
employees by the Administrative Officer of the Foundation at least once 
a year and he will provide a copy of the part to each new employee who 
joins either the National Endowment for the Arts or the National 
Endowment for the Humanities or becomes a member of the shared staff. (A 
list of pertinent statutes is provided in the Appendix to this part.)


<R05>
Sec. 1105.735-5  Conflicts-of-Interest Counselor.

    (a) Conflicts-of-Interest Counselor. The General Counsel of the 
Foundation is designated the Conflicts-of-Interest Counselor, with 
responsibility for providing, on request from any employee, counsel 
regarding conflicts-of-interest regulations and requirements, as well as 
their applicability in particular situations. Each employee is 
responsible for seeking the advice of the Conflicts-of-Interest 
Counselor whenever it appears that he may be, or may become, involved in 
a possible conflicts-of-interest situation. Any supervisor may refer to 
the Conflicts-of-Interest Counselor any possible conflicts-of-interest 
situation involving a subordinate of his whenever he deems such action 
appropriate. In such cases, the subordinate concerned shall be informed 
that the matter has been referred for consideration and shall be 
afforded the opportunity to state his case. The General Counsel of the 
Foundation is responsible for reviewing conflicts-of-interest matters 
brought to his attention and for attempting to work with the employees 
concerned in resolving such situations, and for offering employees an 
opportunity to explain any conflict or appearance of conflict. Matters 
which cannot be satisfactorily resolved in this manner will be referred 
to the Chairman of the Endowment concerned, or, in the case of a share 
staff member, to the Chairmen of both Endowments, for decision and 
appropriate action. Remedial action, whether disciplinary or otherwise, 
shall be effected in accordance with any applicable laws, Executive 
orders, and regulations.
    (b) Disciplinary and other remedial actions. When there is a final 
decision that a conflicts-of-interest situation requires disciplinary or 
other remedial action, such action shall be taken

[[Page 327]]

promptly to end the conflict or appearance of conflict of interest and 
to carry out any appropriate disciplinary measure. Any action taken, 
whether disciplinary or otherwise, shall be effected in accordance with 
applicable laws, Executive orders, Civil Service Commission regulations 
and the regulations in this part. The action taken may involve, among 
other things:
    (1) Divestment by the employee of his conflicting interest;
    (2) Changes in existing duties;
    (3) Disqualification for a particular assignment;
    (4) Appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including removal.

<R05>
Sec. 1105.735-6  Statements of employment and financial interests.

    (a) Employees other than special Government employees--(1) General 
requirement. Statements of employment and financial interests are 
required of all Federal employees occupying positions at or above Grade 
16 or the equivalent, as well as all employees occupying positions which 
either require the exercise of judgment in making a Government decision, 
or in taking Government action with regard to:
    (i) Contracting or procurement;
    (ii) Administering or monitoring grants or subsidies;
    (iii) Regulating or auditing private or other non-Federal 
enterprises;
    (iv) Other activities where the decision or action has an economic 
impact on the interest of a particular non-Federal enterprise; or

require the incumbent to report in order to avoid involvement in a 
possible conflicts-of-interest situation and carry out the purpose of 
law.
    (2) Requirements of the National Endowment for the Arts and the 
National Endowment for the Humanities. In order to fulfill the 
Endowments' obligations under the general Government requirement 
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, it has been determined 
that a Statement of Employment and Financial Interests must be completed 
and submitted in accordance with the procedures set forth in this 
section by employees occupying the following positions:
    (i) National Endowment for the Arts:
    (a) Deputy chairman.
    (b) All special assistants to the chairman and deputy chairman.
    (c) All program, division and office directors.
    (ii) National Endowment for the Humanities:
    (a) Deputy chairman.
    (b) All assistants (including special assistants) to the chairman 
and deputy chairman.
    (c) All program and office directors (but not including the Public 
Information Director).
    (d) All program officers classified at GS-13 and above.
    (iii) Shared staff:
    (a) All attorneys.
    (b) Director and Assistant Director of Administration.
    (c) All auditors classified at GS-13 and above.
    (d) Financial manager.
    (e) Administrative services officer.
    (f) All grants officers.
    (3) Inclusion and exclusion of positions. (i) Whenever appropriate, 
the Chairman of an Endowment may amend paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
to include additional positions in his Endowment that entail submission 
of such statements or may exclude any positions in his Endowment listed 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section the inclusion of which is not 
required by the general requirement in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. 
Inclusion or elimination of shared positions will be accomplished by 
agreement of both Chairmen. Each supervisor is responsible for bringing 
to the attention of the appropriate Chairman (through the Deputy 
Chairman) any position which the supervisor believes should be covered 
or excluded by this requirement.
    (ii) If an employee believes that his position has been improperly 
included among those for which a Statement of Employment and Financial 
Interests is required, he may bring this matter, via the Foundation's 
grievance procedures, to the attention of the appropriate Deputy 
Chairman or, in the case of shared staff, to the attention of both 
Deputy Chairmen. In the event that the recommendation is made that the 
position be included, the employee may

[[Page 328]]

appeal to the Chairman of the Endowment concerned, or, in the case of 
shared staff, to both Chairmen, whose ruling shall be final.
    (iii) Although an employee's position may generally be included 
within the terms of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, such position may 
be excluded from the reporting requirement when it is determined that:
    (a) The duties of a position are such that the likelihood of the 
incumbent's involvement in a conflicts-of-interest situation is remote; 
or
    (b) The duties of a position are at such a level of responsibility 
that the submission of a statement of employment and financial interests 
is not necessary because of the degree of supervision and review over 
the incumbent or the inconsequential effect on the integrity of the 
Government.
    (4) Submission of original and supplementary statements. Each 
employee covered by this requirement shall complete the statement and 
submit it within 90 days after the effective date of this part. Each new 
employee shall complete and submit the statement within 30 days after 
his entrance on duty or within 90 days after the effective date of this 
part, whichever date is later. All changes in, or additions to, the 
information contained in each employee's original statement must be 
reported in a supplementary statement submitted by the employee as of 
June 30 each year. If no changes or additions occur a negative report is 
required. Not withstanding the filing of the annual report required by 
this subparagraph, each employee shall at all times avoid acquiring a 
financial interest that could result, or taking an action that would 
result, in a violation of the conflicts of interest provisions of 
section 208 of title 18, U.S.C., or Sec. 1105.735-7 of this part. The 
Administrative Office of the Foundation is responsible for informing 
each new, affected employee of the requirement for him to submit the 
statement within 30 days after his entrance on duty.
    (5) Interests of employees' relatives. For purposes of the 
statement, the interests of a spouse, minor child, or any other member 
of an employee's immediate household who is a blood relation of the 
employee, are considered to be interests of the employee.
    (6) Information not known by employees. If information required to 
be included on the statement of employment and financial interests 
(supplementary or otherwise, including holdings placed in trust) is not 
known by the employee but is known to another person, the employee shall 
request such other person to submit the information on his behalf.
    (7) Information not required. Employees are not required to submit 
information relating to their financial interests in any professional 
society not conducted as a business enterprise as described in the next 
sentence, charitable, religious, social, fraternal, recreational, public 
service, civic, political, or similar organization not conducted as a 
business enterprise. Professional societies, educational institutions, 
and other nonprofit organizations engaged in research, development, or 
related activities involving grants of money from, or contracts with, 
the Government are deemed ``business enterprises'' and are required to 
be included in employees' statements of employment and financial 
interests.
    (8) Effect of employees' statements on other requirements. The 
statements of employment and financial interests and supplementary 
statements required of employees are in addition to, and are not in 
substitution for, or in derogation of, any similar requirement imposed 
by law, regulation, or Executive order. The submission of the statement 
or supplementary statement by an employee does not permit him or any 
other person to participate in any matter in which his or the other 
person's participation is prohibited by law, regulation, or Executive 
order.
    (9) Confidentiality of employees' statements. Each statement of 
employment and financial interest and each supplementary statement will 
be held in strictest confidence. The officials designated below to 
receive such statements will not allow access to, or information to be 
disclosed from, a statement except to carry out a purpose of this part. 
Information will not be disclosed from the statement except as the Civil 
Service Commission or the

[[Page 329]]

appropriate Chairman (or Chairmen, in the case of shared staff members) 
may authorize for good cause shown.
    (10) Review of statements. (i) Each Deputy Chairman will submit his 
statement to the appropriate Endowment Chairman.
    (ii) Employees of either Endowment shall submit their statements to 
the Deputy Chairman of that Endowment.
    (iii) Joint employees shall submit their statements to both Deputy 
Chairmen.
    (iv) When a statement submitted under paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of 
this section indicates a conflict between the interests of an employee 
and the performance of his services for the Government and when the 
conflict or appearance of conflict cannot be resolved by the Deputy 
Chairman (or by both Deputy Chairmen in the case of joint employees), he 
shall report the information concerning the conflict or appearance of 
conflict to the Chairman through the General Counsel. In the case of 
joint employees, information concerning the conflict or appearance of 
conflict shall be reported to both Chairmen. The employee concerned 
shall be given an opportunity to explain the conflict or appearance of 
conflict before remedial action is initiated.
    (b) Special Government employees. (1) Each special Government 
employee shall submit a statement of employment, and, unless otherwise 
directed, a statement of financial interests not later than the time of 
his employment. It is necessary that the special Government employee 
report all Federal and non-Federal employment, and, when a statement of 
financial interests is required, those financial interests which relate, 
either directly, or indirectly, to his Foundation responsibilities or 
duties.
    (2) Each special Government employee must file a supplementary 
statement of employment and financial interests whenever a significant 
change occurs, either in his employment or financial interests, in order 
that his statement may be kept current.
    (3) The provisions of paragraphs (a) (5) through (9) of this section 
apply to special Government employees in the same manner as to other 
employees.

U.S.C. 959))

<R05>
Sec. 1105.735-7  Employee conduct.

    (a) General. (1) Each Endowment assumes that an employee will 
conduct himself in a manner that will not discredit or embarrass himself 
or the Endowment. However, it is pointed out that the violation of the 
regulations in this part, or any criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, 
or notoriously disgraceful conduct on the part of an employee (whether 
in official duty status or not), is cause for immediate disciplinary 
action, up to and including removal.
    (2) Employees shall avoid any action, whether or not specifically 
prohibited, which might result in or create the appearance of:
    (i) Using public office for private gain;
    (ii) Giving preferential treatment to any person;
    (iii) Impeding Government efficiency or economy;
    (iv) Losing complete independence or impartiality;
    (v) Making a Government decision outside official channels; or
    (vi) Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the 
integrity of the Government.
    (b) Indebtedness. Employees are expected to meet their just 
financial obligations and not to take advantage of the fact that their 
wages are not subject to garnishment for private debts. Failure to meet 
just financial obligations in a proper and timely manner may result in 
disciplinary action, up to, and including, removal. For the purpose of 
this section, a ``just financial obligation'' means one acknowledged by 
the employee or reduced to judgment by a court, and ``in a proper and 
timely manner'' means in a manner which the agency determines does not, 
under the circumstances, reflect adversely on the Government as his 
employer. In the event of dispute between an employee and an alleged 
creditor, this section does not require the Endowment concerned to 
determine

[[Page 330]]

the validity or amount of the disputed debt.
    (c) Payment of taxes. Employees are expected to meet their 
obligations for payment of taxes to Federal, State, and local 
authorities. Delinquency in payment of Federal, State, and local taxes 
is cause for disciplinary action, up to, and including, removal. Federal 
agencies are required to furnish State taxing authorities (including the 
District of Columbia) with a copy of Form W-2 indicating annual earnings 
and Federal income tax withheld. Employees are authorized to pay 
delinquent Federal taxes by payroll deduction: Provided, That they make 
satisfactory arrangements with the Internal Revenue Service to liquidate 
their tax liabilities in this manner. When such arrangements are not 
made, District Directors of Internal Revenue have the authority to levy 
upon the salaries of Federal employees for the full amount of delinquent 
Federal income tax.
    (d) Financial interests. Any employee may hold financial interests 
and engage in financial transactions in the same way as any private 
citizen, provided that such interests or activities are not prohibited 
by law, Executive order, or the regulations in this part. In particular, 
no employee may have any direct or indirect financial interest that 
conflicts substantially or appears to conflict substantially with his 
duties and responsibilities as an Endowment employee. No employee shall 
carry out Endowment duties involving any organization in which he has a 
direct or indirect financial interest. No employee shall engage directly 
or indirectly in any financial transaction resulting from, or primarily 
relying on, information obtained through his employment, or use his 
employment to coerce, or give the appearance of coercing, a person, to 
provide financial benefit to himself or another.
    (e) Participation in Endowment grants by former Endowment employees. 
In cases not directly coming under the prohibitions of 18 U.S.C. 207 
(relating to activities of former Government officials), the following 
rules shall apply:
    (1) In addition to the statutory bars against ever dealing with the 
U.S. Government in connection with a particular matter in which he 
participated personally and substantially while an employee, and against 
dealing with the Government for 1 year after leaving in connection with 
a matter under his official responsibility while in the Government, a 
former regular employee of an Endowment may not negotiate with either 
Endowment, with a view to obtaining support for himself or his 
organization within 1 year after having left the Endowment, except with 
the written permission of the Chairman of the Endowment in which he had 
been employed.
    (2) A former regular employee of an Endowment may not be compensated 
from an Endowment grant directly or indirectly within 1 year of his 
leaving the Endowment, except with the written permission of the 
Chairman of the Endowment in which he had been employed.
    (3) In the case of joint employees, the written permission referred 
to in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section must be given by both 
Chairmen.
    (f) Gifts, entertainment, and favors. Employees may not solicit, or 
accept directly or indirectly from any person, institution, corporation, 
or group, anything of economic value as a gift, gratuity, favor, 
entertainment, or loan, which might be reasonably interpreted by others 
as being of such a nature that it would affect his impartiality. This is 
especially applicable in those instances where the employee has reason 
to believe that the person, institution, corporation, or group:
    (1) Has, is seeking, or is likely to seek, assistance, support, or 
funds from an Endowment; or
    (2) Conducts operations or activities which are involved with, or 
are supported by, an Endowment; or
    (3) Has interests which might be substantially affected by the 
employee's performance or nonperformance of duties; or
    (4) May be attempting to affect the employee's official actions.
    (i) An employee shall not solicit a contribution from another 
employee for a gift to an official superior, make a donation as a gift 
to an official superior, or accept a gift from an employee receiving 
less pay than himself (5 U.S.C. 7351). However, this paragraph does not 
prohibit a voluntary gift of

[[Page 331]]

nominal value or donation in a nominal amount made on a special occasion 
such as marriage, illness, or retirement.
    (ii) Employees are not permitted to accept a gift, or decoration, or 
other objects from a foreign government unless authorized by Congress as 
provided by the Constitution and in 5 U.S.C. 7342.
    (iii) Employees may accept promotional material of nominal intrinsic 
value such as pens, pencils, note pads, calendars, etc. Employees may, 
on infrequent occasions, accept items of nominal value such as food in 
the ordinary course of a luncheon or dinner meeting, site visit, or 
professional conference, when the employee is properly in attendance.
    (iv) Neither this paragraph nor paragraph (g) of this section 
precludes an employee from receipt of bona fide reimbursement, unless 
prohibited by law, for expenses of travel and such other necessary 
subsistence as is compatible with this part for which no Government 
payment or reimbursement is made. However, this paragraph does not allow 
an employee to be reimbursed, or payment to be made on his behalf, for 
excessive personal living expenses, gifts, entertainment or other 
personal benefits, nor does it allow an employee to be reimbursed by a 
person for travel on official business under agency orders when 
reimbursement is proscribed by Decision B-128527 of the Comptroller 
General dated March 7, 1967.
    (g) Outside employment and other activity. (1) Employees shall not 
engage in any outside employment or other outside activity not 
compatible with the full and proper discharge of their duties and 
responsibilities. Incompatible activities include, but are not limited 
to, acceptance of anything of monetary value which may result in or 
create the appearance of a conflict of interest.
    (2) Employees shall not engage in outside employment which tends to 
impair their health or capacity to discharge acceptably their duties and 
responsibilities.
    (3) Regular employees shall not receive anything of value from a 
private source as compensation for their activities as endowment 
employees.
    (4) Employees shall not engage in teaching, lecturing, or writing 
which is dependent on official information obtained as a result of 
Government employment, except when the information has been, or is being 
made available to the general public, or will be made available to the 
public on request, or when the Chairman or Deputy Chairman of the 
Endowment concerned gives written authorization for the use of nonpublic 
information on the basis that the use is in the public interest. 
However, employees are encouraged to engage in teaching, lecturing, and 
writing not prohibited by the regulations in this part, by law, or by 
Executive order.
    (5) Employees shall not receive anything of monetary value for any 
consulting, lecturing, discussion, writing, or presentation, the subject 
of which is devoted to the responsibilities, programs, or operations of 
an Endowment, or which draws on official data or ideas which have not 
become part of the body of public information.
    (6) Employees shall not serve as organizers or directors of 
conferences, colloquia or similar events supported by grant or contract 
from an Endowment, but may otherwise participate in such events provided 
they do not receive any compensation or economic benefit for such 
participation.
    (7) Employees may, however, participate in the affairs of, and 
accept an award for meritorious public contribution or achievement given 
by a charitable, religious, fraternal, educational, recreational, public 
service, or civic organization.
    (h) Advice or assistance to nonprofit or commercial organizations. 
The conditions under which full-time employees may offer assistance or 
advice to nonprofit or commercial organizations are set forth in this 
paragraph (h). Although these conditions are stated as general rules, 
illustrative applications to specific situations are set forth as an aid 
to interpretation:
    (1) General rules. While not on official duty, an employee may 
provide advice or assistance and receive compensation therefor, to 
either nonprofit or commercial organizations: Provided, That such 
services are unrelated to his Government activities and do not draw

[[Page 332]]

upon information deriving from Government sources not publicly 
available.
    (2) Specific examples--(i) Visiting committees. Employees should not 
participate in the deliberations of a college or university visiting 
committee; however, an employee may meet with such groups as an 
Endowment official where it would be appropriate to attend a similar 
meeting with any other comparable group requesting his assistance.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (iii) Membership and office holding in professional societies. An 
employee may be a member of a professional society, but may not serve as 
an officer except where the society has not received any support from an 
Endowment during the preceding three years and the employee has no 
reason to expect it to seek support during the tenure of his office. If 
the society later requests support from an Endowment, the employee 
should resign his office in the society or request permission to remain 
in such office.
    (i) Misuse of information. For the purpose of furthering a private 
interest, employees shall not (except as provided in paragraph (g)(4) of 
this section) directly or indirectly use, or allow the use of, official 
information obtained through, or in connection with, his Government 
employment which has not been made available to the general public.
    (j) Compensation from endowment awarded funds. No regular employee 
may receive any compensation, either directly or indirectly, from funds 
awarded to contractors or grantees by either endowment.
    (k) Use of Federal property. No employee may use Federal property or 
facilities of any kind for other than officially approved activities. 
Every employee has the responsibility to protect and conserve all 
Federal property which has been entrusted to him.
    (l) Exercise of notary powers. Employees who are notaries public may 
not charge or receive any compensation for performing any notarial act 
during working hours, including the luncheon period.
    (m) Political activity. Restrictions in this section are applicable 
to employees on leave, leave without pay, or furlough, as well as to 
other regular employees. Individuals whose employment is on an 
intermittent basis (not occupying a substantial portion of their time) 
are subject to the political activities restrictions only while they are 
in an active duty status. The period of active duty status for a 
particular employee includes the entire 24-hour period of any day of 
actual employment. The ``Federal Personnel Manual'' may be consulted in 
the Foundation Administrative Office. If an employee is in doubt about 
permissible activities, he should contact the Administrative Office for 
clarification.
    (1) Employees may not use their official positions or influence for 
the purpose of interfering with an election and they may not take an 
active part in political management or in political campaigns, except as 
provided in paragraphs (m) (4) and (5) of this section.
    (2) No employee may discriminate against another employee because of 
his political opinions or affiliations.
    (3) An employee may not become a candidate for nomination or 
election to a Federal, State, county, or municipal office on a partisan 
political ticket. Nor may an employee become a candidate as an 
independent when opposed by a partisan political candidate, except as 
provided in paragraph (m)(4) of this section.
    (4) Certain political subdivisions in the vicinity of Washington, 
D.C., as well as other municipalities, designated by the Civil Service 
Commission, have been granted a limited exception to the rules 
prohibiting political management or candidacy for local office. In such 
municipalities, employees may become candidates as independents, even 
when opposed by partisan political candidates.
    (5) In general, employees are encouraged to be candidates for, and 
to hold, State, county, or municipal offices of a nonpartisan nature 
when permitted by law. Employees desiring to be candidates for, or to 
hold, a State or local office or to undertake the political management 
of a candidacy for such office, must secure the approval of the 
appropriate Endowment Chairman or, in the case of members of the shared 
staff, of both Chairmen.

    (6) Full-time employees, with the prior consent of the Chairman 
concerned, or of both Chairmen, in the case of members of the shared 
staff, may hold positions under a State or local government on a part-
time basis only. Intermittent employees may hold full-time or part-time 
State or local government positions. In both cases, the above 
restrictions on political activity must be observed.
    (n) An employee shall not participate, while on Government-owned or 
leased property or while on duty for the Government, in any gambling 
activity, such as a lottery or the sale or purchase of numbers, etc.

<R05>
Sec. 1110.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to effectuate the provisions of title VI 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (hereafter referred to as the ``Act'') 
to the end that no person in the United States shall, on the ground of 
race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be 
denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination 
under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance 
from the National Endowment for the Arts or the National Endowment for 
the Humanities.


<R05>
Sec. 1110.2  Application of part.

    This part applies to any program for which Federal financial 
assistance is authorized under a law administered by the National 
Endowment for the Arts or the National Endowment for the Humanities 
including the federally assisted programs and activities listed in 
Appendix A of this part. It applies to money paid, property transferred, 
or other Federal financial assistance extended under any such program 
after the effective date of the part, including assistance pursuant to 
an application approved prior to such date. It also applies to federal 
financial assistance extended to any such program prior to the effective 
date of this part under a contract or grant where the term of the 
contract or grant continues beyond such date or where the assistance was 
to provide real or personal property and the recipient or his transferee 
continues to use or retain ownership or possession of the property (see 
Sec. 1110.4(a)(1)). This part does not apply to (a) any Federal 
financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty contract, (b) any 
assistance to any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary under any 
such program, or (c) any employment practice, under any such program, of 
any employer, employment agency, or labor organization, except to the 
extent described in Sec. 1110.3. The fact that a program or activity is 
not listed in Appendix A shall not mean, if title VI of the Act is 
otherwise applicable, that such program is not covered. Other programs 
under statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to this 
list by notice published in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 1110.3  Discrimination prohibited.

    (a) General. No person in the United States shall, on grounds of 
race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be 
denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected, to discrimination 
under any program to which this part applies.
    (b) Specific discriminatory actions prohibited. (1) A recipient 
under any program to which this part applies may not directly or through 
contractual or other arrangements, on the ground of race, color, or 
national origin:
    (i) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit 
provided under the program;
    (ii) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to an 
individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner, 
from that provided to others under the program;
    (iii) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in 
any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or 
other benefit under the program;
    (iv) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any 
advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, 
financial aid, or other benefit under the program;
    (v) Treat an individual differently from others in determining 
whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, 
membership, or other requirement or condition which individuals must 
meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other 
benefit provided under the program;
    (vi) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program 
through the provision of services or otherwise or afford him an 
opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under 
the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program as 
an employee but only to the extent set forth in paragraph (c) of this 
section).
    (2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial 
aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any 
such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in 
which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities

[[Page 335]]

will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to 
be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not 
directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria 
or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting 
individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national 
origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing 
accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respects individuals 
of a particular race, color, or national origin.
    (3) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient 
or applicant may not make selections with the purpose or effect of 
excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting 
them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation 
applies, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin; or with the 
purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the 
accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this regulation.
    (4) As used in this section, the services, financial aid, or other 
benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance 
shall be deemed to include any service, financial aid, or other benefit 
provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal 
financial assistance.
    (5) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination 
in this paragraph and paragraph (c) of this section does not limit the 
generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (6) This regulation does not prohibit the consideration of race, 
color, or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove or 
overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have 
restricted the availability of, or participation in, the program or 
activity receiving Federal financial assistance, on the grounds of race, 
color, or national origin. Where previous discriminatory practice or 
usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to 
exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, 
or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to 
which this regulation applies the applicant or recipient has an 
obligation to take reasonable action to remove or overcome the 
consequences of the prior discriminatory practice or usage, and to 
accomplish the purposes of the Act.
    (c) Employment practices. (1) Where a primary objective of the 
Federal financial assistance to a program to which this part applies is 
to provide employment, a recipient may not directly or through 
contractual or other arrangements subject an individual to 
discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its 
employment practices under such program (including recruitment or 
recruitment advertising employment, layoff or termination, upgrading, 
demotion, or transfer, rates of pay or other forms of compensation and 
use of facilities), including programs where a primary objective of the 
Federal financial assistance is (i) to assist such individuals through 
employment to meet expenses incident to the commencement or continuation 
of their education or training or (ii) to provide work experience which 
contributes to the education or training of such individuals or (iii) to 
reduce the unemployment of such individuals or to help them through 
employment to meet subsistence needs.
    (2) The requirements applicable to construction employment under any 
such program shall be those specified in or pursuant to Executive Order 
11246 or any executive order which supersedes it.
    (3) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is 
not to provide employment, but discrimination on the grounds of race, 
color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient 
or other persons subject to the regulation tends, on the grounds of 
race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from 
participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to 
discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, the 
provisions of the foregoing subparagraph of this paragraph (c) shall 
apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other persons 
subject to the regulation, to the extent necessary to assure equality of 
opportunity to and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries.

[[Page 336]]

    (d) Medical emergencies. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of 
this section, a recipient of Federal financial assistance shall not be 
deemed to have failed to comply with paragraph (a) of this section if 
immediate provision of a service or other benefit to an individual is 
necessary to prevent his death or serious impairment of his health and 
such service or other benefit cannot be provided except by or through a 
medical institution which refuses or fails to comply with paragraph (a) 
of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1110.4  Assurances required.

    (a) General. (1) Every application for Federal financial assistance 
to carry out a program to which this part applies, and every application 
for Federal financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a 
condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial 
assistance pursuant to the application, contain or be accompanied by an 
assurance that the program will be conducted or the facility operated in 
compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part. In 
the case where the Federal financial assistance is to provide or is in 
the form of personal property, or real property or interest therein or 
structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or, in 
the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during 
which the property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial 
assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of 
similar services and benefits, or for as long as the recipient retains 
ownership or possession of the property, whichever is longer; and any 
other type or form of assistance, the assurances shall be in effect for 
the duration of the period during which Federal financial assistance is 
extended to the program. The responsible Endowment official shall 
specify the form of the foregoing assurances for each program and the 
extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, 
contractors and subcontractors, successors in interest, and other 
participants in the program. Any such assurance shall include provisions 
which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.
    (2) In the case of real property, structures or improvements 
thereon, or interests therein, which was acquired through a program of 
Federal financial assistance, or in the case where Federal financial 
assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property or 
interest therein from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting 
or recording the transfer, shall contain a covenant running with the 
land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real 
property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial 
assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of 
similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved, 
but property is improved under a program of Federal financial 
assistance, the recipients shall agree to include such a covenant in any 
subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained 
from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition 
coupled with a right to be reserved by the Endowment to revert title to 
the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the 
discretion of the responsible Endowment official, such a condition and 
right of reverter is appropriate to the program under which the real 
property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In 
the event a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or 
otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing 
construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such 
property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the 
Chairman of the Endowment concerned may agree, upon request of the 
transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such 
conditions as he deems appropriate, to forebear the exercise of such 
right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other 
encumbrance remains effective.
    (3) Transfers of surplus property are subject to regulations issued 
by the Administrator of the General Services Administration. (41 CFR 
101-6.2)
    (b) Continuing State programs. Every application by a State or a 
State agency to carry out a program involving continuing Federal 
financial assistance

[[Page 337]]

to which this part applies shall as a condition to its approval and the 
extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the 
application (1) contain or be accompanied by a statement that the 
program is (or, in the case of a new program, will be) conducted in 
compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part, 
and (2) provide or be accompanied by provision for such methods of 
administration for the program as are found by the responsible Endowment 
official to give reasonable assurance that the applicant and all 
recipients of Federal financial assistance under such program will 
comply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part.
    (c) Elementary and secondary schools. The requirements of paragraph 
(a) of this section with respect to any elementary or secondary school 
or school system shall be deemed to be satisfied if such school or 
school system (1) is subject to a final order of a court of the United 
States for the desegregation of such school or school system, and 
provides an assurance that it will comply with such order, including any 
future modification of such order, or (2) submits a plan for the 
desegregation of such school or school system which the responsible 
official of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare determines 
is adequate to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this part within 
the earliest practicable time and provides reasonable assurance that it 
will carry out such plan. In any case of continuing Federal financial 
assistance, the responsible official of the Department of Health, 
Education, and Welfare may reserve the right to redetermine, after such 
period as may be specified by him, the adequacy of the plan to 
accomplish the purposes of the Act and this part. In any case in which a 
final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of 
such school or school system is entered after submission of such a plan, 
such plan shall be revised to conform to such final order, including any 
future modification of such order.
    (d) Assurances from institutions. (1) In the case of any application 
for Federal financial assistance to an institution of higher education 
(including assistance for construction, for research, for a special 
training project, or for any other purpose), the assurance required by 
this section shall extend to admission practices and to all other 
practices relating to the treatment of students.
    (2) The assurance required with respect to an institution of higher 
education or any other institution, insofar as the assurance relates to 
the institution's practices with respect to admission or other treatment 
of individuals as students, or clients of the institution or to the 
opportunity to participate in the provision of services or other 
benefits to such individuals, shall be applicable to the entire 
institution unless the applicant establishes, to the satisfaction of the 
responsible Endowment official, that the institution's practices in 
designated parts or programs of the institution will in no way affect 
its practices in the program of the institution for which Federal 
financial assistance is sought, or the beneficiaries of or participants 
in, such program. If in any such case the assistance sought is for the 
construction of a facility or part of a facility, the assurance shall in 
any event extend to the entire facility and to facilities operated in 
connection therewith.


<R05>
Sec. 1110.5  Illustrative applications.

    The following examples will illustrate the application of the 
foregoing provisions to some of the activities for which Federal 
financial assistance is provided by the Endowments. (In all cases the 
discrimination prohibited is discrimination on the ground of race, 
color, or national origin prohibited by title VI of the Act and this 
part, as a condition of the receipt of Federal financial assistance.)
    (a) In a research, training, or other grant to a university for 
activities to be conducted in a graduate school, discrimination in the 
admission and treatment of students in the graduate school is 
prohibited, and the prohibition extends to the entire university, unless 
it satisfies the responsible Endowment official that practices with 
respect to other parts or programs of the university will not interfere, 
directly or indirectly, with fulfillment of

[[Page 338]]

the assurance required with respect to the graduate school.
    (b) In cases of Federal financial assistance to elementary or 
secondary schools, discrimination by the recipient school district in 
any of its elementary or secondary schools, or by the recipient private 
institution, in the admission of students, or in the treatment of its 
students in any aspect of the educational process, is prohibited. In 
this and the following illustration the prohibition of discrimination in 
the treatment of students or other trainees includes the prohibition of 
discrimination among the students or trainees in the availability or use 
of any academic, dormitory, eating, recreational, or other facilities of 
the grantee or other recipient.
    (c) In a training grant to a nonacademic institution, discrimination 
is prohibited in the selection of individuals to be trained and in their 
treatment by the grantee during their training. In a research or 
demonstration grant to such an institution, discrimination is prohibited 
with respect to any educational activity, any provision of medical or 
other services and any financial aid to individuals incident to the 
program.
    (d) Where Federal financial assistance is provided to assist in the 
presentation of artistic and cultural productions to the public, 
assurances will be required that such productions will not be presented 
before any audience which has been selected on a discriminatory basis.
    (e) A recipient may not take action that is calculated to bring 
about indirectly what this part forbids it to accomplish directly. Thus, 
a State, in selecting projects to be supported through a State agency, 
may not base its selections on criteria which have the effect of 
defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of 
the Federal financial assistance as respects individuals of a particular 
race, color, or national origin.
    (f) In some situations even though past discriminatory practices 
have been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to 
impede the full availability of a benefit. If the efforts required of 
the applicant or recipient under Sec. 1110.6(d) to provide information 
as to the availability of the program or activity, and the rights of 
beneficiaries under this regulation, have failed to overcome these 
consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient 
to take additional steps to make the benefits fully available to racial 
and nationality groups previously subjected to discrimination. This 
action might take the form, for example of special arrangements for 
obtaining referrals or making selections which will insure that groups 
previously subjected to discrimination are adequately served.
    (g) Even though an applicant or recipient has never used 
discriminatory policies, the services and benefits of the program or 
activity it administers may not in fact be equally available to some 
racial or nationality groups. In such circumstances an applicant or 
recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or 
national origin to make the benefits of its program more widely 
available to such groups, not then being adequately served. For example, 
where a university is not adequately serving members of a particular 
racial or nationality group, it may establish special recruitment 
policies to make its program better known and more readily available to 
such group, and take other steps to provide that group with more 
adequate service.


<R05>
Sec. 1110.6  Compliance information.

    (a) Cooperation and assistance. The responsible Endowment official 
shall, to the fullest extent practicable, seek the cooperation of 
recipients in obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide 
assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily 
with this part.
    (b) Compliance reports. Each recipient shall keep such records and 
submit to the responsible Endowment official timely, complete and 
accurate compliance reports at such times, and in such form and 
containing such information, as the responsible Endowment official may 
determine to be necessary to enable him to ascertain whether the 
recipient has complied or is complying with this part. In the case of 
any program under which a primary recipient extends Federal financial 
assistance to

[[Page 339]]

any other recipient, such other recipient shall also submit such 
compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to 
enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this 
part.
    (c) Access to sources of information. Each recipient shall permit 
access by the responsible Endowment official or his designee during 
normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other 
sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to 
ascertain compliance with this part. Where any information required of a 
recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, 
institution or person and this agency, institution or person shall fail 
or refuse to furnish this information, the recipient shall so certify in 
its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the 
information.
    (d) Information to beneficiaries and participants. Each recipient 
shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other 
interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this 
part and its applicability to the program under which the recipient 
receives Federal financial assistance, and make such information 
available to them in such manner, as the responsible Endowment official 
finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against 
discrimination assured them by the Act and this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1110.7  Conduct of investigations.

    (a) Periodic compliance reviews. The responsible Endowment official 
shall from time to time review the practices of recipients to determine 
whether they are complying with this part.
    (b) Complaints. Any person who believes himself or any specific 
class of individuals to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by 
this part may by himself or by a representative file with the 
responsible Endowment official a written complaint. A complaint must be 
filed not later than ninety days from the date of the alleged 
discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the 
responsible Endowment official.
    (c) Investigations. The responsible Endowment official will make a 
prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or 
any other information indicates a possible failure to comply with this 
part. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of 
the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the circumstances 
under which the possible noncompliance with this part occurred, and 
other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the recipient 
has failed to comply with this part.
    (d) Resolution of matters. (1) If an investigation pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with this 
part, the responsible Endowment official will so inform the recipient 
and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever possible. If 
it has been determined that the matter cannot be resolved by informal 
means, action will be taken as provided for in Sec. 1110.8.
    (2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the responsible Endowment official 
will so inform the recipient and the complainant, if any, in writing.
    (e) Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited. No recipient or 
other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against 
any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or 
privilege secured by section 601 of the Act or this part, or because he 
has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner 
in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part. The 
identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent 
necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct 
of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising 
thereunder.


<R05>
Sec. 1110.8  Procedure for effecting compliance.

    (a) General. If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure 
to comply with this part, and if the noncompliance or threatened 
noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with 
this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal 
to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance or by any other 
means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are

[[Page 340]]

not limited to, (1) a reference to the Department of Justice with a 
recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any 
rights of the United States under any law of the United States 
(including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other 
contractual undertaking, and (2) any applicable proceeding under State 
or local law.
    (b) Noncompliance with Sec. 1110.4. If an applicant fails or refuses 
to furnish an assurance required under Sec. 1110.4 or otherwise fails to 
comply with that section, Federal financial assistance may be refused in 
accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The 
Endowment concerned shall not be required to provide assistance in such 
a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such 
paragraph, except that such Endowment shall continue assistance during 
the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and 
payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to the 
effective date of this part.
    (c) Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal 
financial assistance. No order suspending, terminating, or refusing to 
grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective 
until (1) the responsible Endowment official has advised the applicant 
or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance 
cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) there has been an express 
finding on the record, after opportunity for hearings, of a failure by 
the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or 
pursuant to this part, (3) the action has been approved by the Chairman 
of the Endowment concerned, and (4) the expiration of 30 days after the 
Chairman has filed with the Committee of the House and the Committee of 
the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a 
full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such 
action. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to 
continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular 
political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to 
whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to 
the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has 
been so found.
    (d) Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance by 
any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) the 
responsible Endowment official has determined that compliance cannot be 
secured by voluntary means, (2) the recipient or other person has been 
notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to 
effect compliance, and (3) the expiration of at least 10 days from the 
mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person. During this 
period of at least 10 days, additional efforts shall be made to persuade 
the recipient or other person to comply with this part and to take such 
corrective action as may be appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 1110.9  Hearings.

    (a) Opportunity for hearing. Whenever an opportunity for a hearing 
is required by Sec. 1110.8(c), reasonable notice shall be given by 
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected 
applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or 
recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision 
under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the 
matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and 
either:
    (1) Fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice 
within which the applicant or recipient may request of the responsible 
Endowment official that the matter be scheduled for hearing or
    (2) Advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question 
has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and 
place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for 
cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place 
of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit 
written information and argument for the record. The failure of an 
applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph or to 
appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be 
a waiver of the right of a hearing under section 602 of the Act and 
Sec. 1110.8(c) of this part and

[[Page 341]]

consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as 
is available.
    (b) Time and place of hearing. Hearings shall be held at the offices 
of the Endowment concerned in Washington, DC, at a time fixed by the 
responsible Endowment official unless he determines that the convenience 
of the applicant or recipient or of the Endowment requires that another 
place be selected. Hearings shall be held before the responsible 
Endowment official or, at his discretion, before a hearing examiner 
designated in accordance with section 11 of the Administrative Procedure 
Act.
    (c) Right to counsel. In all proceedings under this section, the 
applicant or recipient and the Endowment shall have the right to be 
represented by counsel.
    (d) Procedures, evidence, and record. (1) The hearing, decision, and 
any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with 
5 U.S.C. 554-557 (sections 5-8 of the Administrative Procedure Act), and 
in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not 
inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, 
giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of 
this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, 
requests for findings, and other related matters. Both the Endowment and 
the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant 
evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as 
determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or 
during the hearing.
    (2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings 
conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to 
assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject 
testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably 
necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may 
exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All 
documents and other evidence entered or taken for the record shall be 
open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to 
refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A 
transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the 
substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be 
based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.
    (e) Consolidated or joint hearings. In cases in which the same or 
related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this 
Regulation with respect to two or more programs to which this part 
applies, or noncompliance with this part and the regulations of one or 
more other Federal departments or agencies issued under title VI of the 
Act, the Chairman of the Endowment concerned may, by agreement with such 
other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct 
of consolidated or joint hearings and for the application to such 
hearings of rules or procedures not inconsistent with this part. Final 
decisions in such cases, insofar as this regulation is concerned, shall 
be made in accordance with Sec. 1110.10.


<R05>
Sec. 1110.10  Decisions and notices.

    (a) Decision by person other than the responsible Endowment 
official. If the hearing is held by a hearing examiner such hearing 
examiner shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or 
certify the entire record including his recommended findings and 
proposed decision to the responsible Endowment official for a final 
decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be 
mailed to the applicant or recipient. Where the initial decision is made 
by the hearing examiner the applicant or recipient may within 30 days of 
the mailing of such notice of initial decision file with the responsible 
Endowment official his exceptions to the initial decision, with his 
reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the responsible 
Endowment official may on his own motion within 45 days after the 
initial decision serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that he 
will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such 
notice of review the responsible Endowment official shall review the 
initial decision and issue his own decision thereon including the 
reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of 
review the initial decision

[[Page 342]]

shall constitute the final decision of the responsible Endowment 
official.
    (b) Decisions on record or review by the responsible Endowment 
official. Whenever a record is certified to the responsible Endowment 
official for decision or he reviews the decision of a hearing examiner 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or whenever the responsible 
Endowment official conducts the hearing, the applicant or recipient 
shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with him briefs or other 
written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision 
of the responsible Endowment official shall be given in writing to the 
applicant or recipient and to the complainant if any.
    (c) Decisions on record where a hearing is waived. Whenever a 
hearing is waived pursuant to Sec. 1110.9(a) a decision shall be made by 
the responsible Endowment official on the record and a copy of such 
decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to 
the complainant, if any.
    (d) Rulings required. Each decision of a hearing officer or 
responsible Endowment official shall set forth his ruling on each 
finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the 
requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with 
which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.
    (e) Approval by Chairman. Any final decision of a responsible 
Endowment official (other than the Chairman) which provides for the 
suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue 
Federal financial assistance, or the imposition of any other sanction 
available under this part or the Act, shall promptly be transmitted to 
the Chairman, who may approve such decision, may vacate it, or remit or 
mitigate any sanction imposed.
    (f) Content of orders. The final decision may provide for suspension 
or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial 
assistance, in whole or in part, under the program involved, and may 
contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent 
with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part, 
including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial 
assistance will thereafter be extended under such program to the 
applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in default in 
its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to this part, or to 
have otherwise failed to comply with this part, unless and until it 
corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the responsible Endowment 
official that it will fully comply with this part.
    (g) Post termination proceedings. (1) An applicant or recipient 
adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this 
section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal 
financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that 
order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with 
this regulation and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully 
comply with this regulation. (An elementary or secondary school or 
school system which is unable to file an assurance of compliance with 
Sec. 1110.3 shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal 
financial assistance, if it files a court order or a plan for 
desegregation which meets the requirements of Sec. 1110.4(c), and 
provides reasonable assurance that it will comply with this court order 
or plan.)
    (2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order 
entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time 
request the responsible Endowment official to restore fully its 
eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request 
shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or 
recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. 
If the responsible Endowment official determines that those requirements 
have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility.
    (3) If the responsible Endowment official denies any such request, 
the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in 
writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. 
It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on 
the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the 
responsible Endowment official. The applicant or recipient will be 
restored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it 
satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While

[[Page 343]]

proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by 
the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in 
effect.


<R05>
Sec. 1110.11  Judicial review.

    Action taken pursuant to section 602 of the Act is subject to 
judicial review as provided in section 603 of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 1110.12  Effect on other regulations; forms and instructions.

    (a) Effects on other regulations. Nothing in this part shall be 
deemed to supersede any of the following (including future amendments 
thereof): (1) Executive Orders 10925, 11114, and 11246, and regulations 
issued thereunder, or (2) Executive Order 11063 and regulations issued 
thereunder or any other regulations or instructions insofar as such 
order, regulations, or instructions prohibit discrmination on the 
grounds of race, color, or national origin in any program or situation 
to which this part is inapplicable, or prohibit discrimination on any 
other ground.
    (b) Forms and instructions. Each responsible Endowment official 
shall issue and promptly make available to interested persons forms and 
detailed instructions and procedures for effectuating this part as 
applied to programs to which this part applies and for which he is 
responsible.
    (c) Supervision and coordination. The Chairman of an Endowment may 
from time to time assign to other officials of the Endowment or to 
officials of other departments or agencies of the Government, with the 
consent of such departments or agencies, responsibilities in connection 
with the effectuation of the purposes of title VI of the Act and this 
part, including the achievement of effective coordination and maximum 
uniformity within the Endowment and within the executive branch of the 
Government in the application of title VI and this part of similar 
programs and in similar situations. Any action taken, determination 
made, or requirement imposed by an official of another department or 
agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility under this 
subsection shall have the same effect as though such action had been 
taken by the responsible official of this agency.

<R05>
Sec. 1115.3  Procedures for notification of existence of records pertaining to individuals.

    (a) The systems of records, as defined in the Privacy Act of 1974, 
maintained by the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities are 
listed annually in the Federal Register as required by that Act. Any 
person who wishes to know whether a system of records contains a record 
pertaining to him may appear in person at the National Endowment for the 
Arts, Room 1338, 2401 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20506 or the National 
Endowment for the Humanities, Room 1000, 806 15th Street NW., 
Washington, DC 20506, on work days between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 
5:30 p.m. or by writing to the Office of the General Counsel, National 
Endowment for the Arts or National Endowment for the Humanities, 
Washington, DC 20506. It is recommended that requests be made in 
writing, since in many cases it will take several days to ascertain 
whether a record exists.
    (b) Requests for notification of the existence of a record should 
specifically identify the system of records involved and should state, 
if the requestor is other than the individual to whom the record 
pertains, the relationship of the requestor to that individual. (Note 
that requests will not be honored by the Foundation pursuant to the 
Privacy Act unless made (1) by the individual to whom the record 
pertains, (2) by such individual's parent if the individual is a minor, 
or (3) by such individual's legal guardian if the individual has been 
declared to be incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age 
by a court of competent jurisdiction).
    (c) The Foundation will attempt to respond to a request as to 
whether a record exists within 10 working days from the time it receives 
the request or from the time any required identification is established, 
whichever is later.


<R05>
Sec. 1115.4  Procedures for requests for access to or disclosure of records pertaining to an individual.

    (a) Any person may request review of records pertaining to him by 
appearing at the National Endowment for the Arts, Room 1338, 2401 E 
Street, NW., Washington, DC 20506, or the National Endowment for the 
Humanities, Room 1000, 806 15th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20506 on 
work days between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. or by writing to 
the Office of the General Counsel, National Endowment for the Arts, or 
National Endowment for the Humanities, Washington, DC 20506. (See 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section for identification requirements.) 
The request should specifically identify the systems or records 
involved. The Foundation will strive either to make the record available 
within 15 working days of the request or to inform the requestor of the 
need for additional identification or the tendering of fees (as 
specified in paragraph (d) of this section) within 15 working days.
    (b) In the case of persons making requests by appearing at the 
Foundation, the amount of personal identification required will of 
necessity vary with the sensitivity of the record involved. Except as 
indicated below, reasonable identification such as employment 
identification cards, drivers licenses,

[[Page 346]]

and credit cards will normally be accepted as sufficient evidence of 
identity in the absence of any indications to the contrary. Records in 
the following systems of records, however, are considered to contain 
relatively sensitive and/or detailed personal information--

GRANT APPLICATIONS--NEA.
GRANT APPLICATIONS--NEH.
GRANTS TO INDIVIDUALS--NEA.
GRANTS TO INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS--NEH.
EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY CASE FILE--NFAH NEA/NEH.
EMPLOYEE PAYROLL--NFAH.
PERSONNEL RECORDS--NFAH.

Accordingly, with respect to requests for records in these systems the 
Foundation reserves the rights to require sufficient identification to 
identify positively the individual making the request. This might 
involve independent verification by the Foundation as by phone calls to 
determine whether an individual has made a request, personal 
identification by Foundation employees who know the individual, or such 
other means as are considered appropriate under the circumstances.
    (c) A written request will be honored only if it contains the 
following certification before a duly commissioned notary public of any 
state or territory (or similar official if the request is made outside 
the United States):

    I,--------------------(Printed name), do hereby certify that I am 
the individual about whom the record requested in this letter pertains 
or that I am within the class of persons authorized to act on his behalf 
in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(h).

          ______________________________________________________________

(s) My Commission expires_______________________________________________

However, where the record requested is contained in any of the systems 
of records listed in paragraph (b) of this section, the Foundation 
reserves the right to require additional identification and/or to 
independently verify to its satisfaction, the identity of the requestor.
    (d) Charges for copies of records will be at the rate of $0.10 per 
photography of each page. Where records are not susceptible to photo-
copying, e.g., punch cards, magnetic tapes or oversize materials, the 
amount charged will be actual cost as determined on a case-by-case 
basis. Only one copy of each record requested will be supplied. No 
charge will be made unless the charge as computed above would exceed 
$3.00 for each request or related series of requests. If a fee in excess 
of $25.00 would be required, the requestor shall be notified and the fee 
must be tendered before the records will be copied.


<R05>
Sec. 1115.5  Correction of records.

    (a) Any individual is entitled to request amendments of records 
pertaining to him pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2). Such a request shall 
be made in writing and addressed to the Office of the General Counsel, 
National Endowment for the Arts or National Endowment for the 
Humanities, Washington, DC 20506.
    (b) The request should specify the record and systems of records 
involved, and should specify the exact correction desired and state that 
the request is made pursuant to the Privacy Act. An edited copy of the 
record showing the desired correction is desirable. Within 10 working 
days of the receipt of a properly addressed request (or within 10 
working days of the time the General Counsel, National Endowment for the 
Arts or the General Counsel, National Endowment for the Humanities 
becomes aware that a particular communication not addressed as 
prescribed above is a request for correction of a record under the 
Privacy Act), the General Counsel's office shall acknowledge receipt of 
the request.
    (c) The General Counsel's office upon receipt of such a request 
shall promptly confer with the office within the Foundation responsible 
for the record. In the event it is felt that correction is not warranted 
in whole or in part, the matter shall be brought to the attention of the 
Deputy Chairman of the Endowment involved. If, after review by the 
Deputy Chairman of the involved Endowment and discussion with the 
request or, if deemed helpful, it is determined that correction as 
requested is

[[Page 347]]

not warranted, a letter shall be sent by the Deputy Chairman's office to 
the requestor denying his request and/or explaining what correction 
might be made if agreeable to the requestor. This letter shall set forth 
the reasons for the refusal to honor the request for correction. It 
shall also inform him of his right to appeal this decision and include a 
description of the appeals procedure set forth in paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (d) An appeal may be taken from an adverse determination under 
paragraph (c) of this section to the Assistant Chairman/Management, 
National Endowment for the Arts or the Chairman, National Endowment for 
the Humanities. Such appeal must be made in writing and should clearly 
indicate that it is an appeal. The basis for the appeal should be 
included, and it should be mailed to the same address as listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section. A hearing at the Foundation may be 
requested. Such hearing will be informal, and shall be before the 
Assistant Chairman/Management, National Endowment for the Arts, the 
Chairman, National Endowment for the Humanities, or an appointed 
designee. If no hearing is requested, the request for appeal should 
include the basis for the appeal. Where no hearing is requested the 
Assistant Chairman or Chairman before whom the appeal is taken shall 
render his decision within thirty working days after receipt of the 
written appeal at the Foundation, unless the Assistant Chairman or 
Chairman before whom the appeal is taken, for good cause shown, extends 
the 30-day period and the appellant is advised in writing of such 
extension. If a hearing is requested, the Foundation will attempt to 
contact the appellant within five working days and arrange a suitable 
time for the hearing. In such cases the decision of the Assistant 
Chairman or Chairman shall be made within 30 working days after the 
hearing unless the time is extended and the appellant is advised in 
writing of such extension.

    Source:  40 FR 51196, Nov. 4, 1975, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.1  Scope.

    This subpart sets forth the regulations of the National Endowment 
for the Arts implementing the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 (the 
Act) in conformity with the standards jointly promulgated by the 
Attorney General and the Comptroller General in 4 CFR parts 101 through 
105. The Act (a) requires the head of an agency or his designee to 
attempt collection of all claims of the United States for money or 
property arising out of the activities of the National Endowment for the 
Arts; and (b) authorizes the head of an agency or his designee to 
compromise such claims that do not exceed $20,000 exclusive of interest, 
or to suspend or terminate collection action where it appears that no 
person liable on such claims has the present or prospective financial 
ability to pay any significant sum thereon or that the cost of 
collecting such claim is likely to exceed the amount of recovery.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.2  Incorporation of joint standards by reference.

    All administrative actions to collect claims arising out of the 
activities of the National Endowment for the Arts shall be performed in 
accordance with the applicable standards prescribed in 4 CFR parts 101 
through 105, which are incorporated by reference and supplemented in 
this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.3  Subdivision and joining of claims.

    (a) A debtor's liability arising from a particular transaction or 
contract shall be considered as a single claim in determining whether 
the claim is one not exceeding $20,000 exclusive of interest for the 
purpose of compromise or termination of collection action. Such a claim 
may not be subdivided to avoid the monetary ceiling established by the 
Act.
    (b) Joining of two or more single claims in a demand upon a 
particular debtor for payment totaling more than $20,000 does not 
preclude compromise or termination of collection action with respect to 
any one of such claims that does not exceed $20,000 exclusive of 
interest.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.4  Referral of claims to the General Counsel.

    (a) Authority of the General Counsel. The General Counsel shall 
exercise the powers and perform the duties of the head of the agency to 
compromise or to suspend or terminate collection action on all claims 
not exceeding $20,000 exclusive of interest. Claims shall be referred to 
the General Counsel well within the applicable statute of limitations 
(28 U.S.C. 2415 and 2416), but in no event more than 2 years after the 
claims accrued.
    (b) Exclusions. There shall be no compromise or terminated 
collection action with respect to any claim: (1) As to which there is an 
indication of fraud, the presentation of a false claim, or 
misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any other party having an 
interest in the claim; (2) based in whole or in part on conduct in 
violation of the anti-trust laws; (3) based on tax statutes; or (4) 
arising from an exception made by the General Accounting Office in the 
account of an accountable officer. Such claims shall be promptly

[[Page 349]]

referred to the Justice Department or GAO, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.5  Accounting control.

    The General Counsel shall process all claims collections through the 
appropriate accounting office and report the collection, compromise, 
suspension and termination of all claims to the appropriate accounting 
office for recording.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.6  Record retention.

    The file of each claim on which administrative collection action has 
been completed shall be retained by the appropriate office or the 
General Counsel not less than 1 year after the applicable statute of 
limitations has run.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.7  Suspension or revocation of eligibility.

    (a) In the event a contractor, grantee, or other participant in 
programs sponsored by the Endowment fails to pay his debts to the 
Endowment within a reasonable time after demand, the fact shall be 
reported by the Grants, Audit, or other appropriate office to the 
General Counsel, who shall place such defaulting participant's name on 
the Endowment's list of debarred, suspended and ineligible contractors 
and grantees and the participant will be so advised.
    (b) The failure of any surety to honor its obligations in accordance 
with 6 U.S.C. 11 is to be reported at once to the General Counsel who 
shall so advise the Treasury Department. The Treasury Department will 
notify the Endowment when a surety's certificate of authority to do 
business with the Government has been revoked or forfeited.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.8  Standards for collection of claims.

    (a) Demand for payment. Appropriate written demands shall be made 
upon the debtor which shall include information relating to the 
consequences of his failure to cooperate.
    (b) Collection by offset. Collection by offset will be 
administratively undertaken on claims which are liquidated or certain in 
amount in every instance where this is feasible.
    (c) Liquidation of collateral. When the Endowment holds security or 
collateral that may be liquidated and the proceeds applied on debts due 
it through the exercise of a power of sale in the security instrument or 
a nonjudicial foreclosure, such procedures should be followed if the 
debtor fails to pay his debt within a reasonable time after demand, 
unless the cost of disposing of the collateral will be disproportionate 
to its value or special circumstances require judicial foreclosure.
    (d) Collection in installments. Claims with accrued interest should 
be collected in full or one lump sum whenever this is possible. However, 
if the debtor is financially unable to pay the indebtedness in one lump 
sum, payment may be accepted in regular installments.
    (e) Interest. In the event prejudgment interest is not mandated by 
statute, contract or regulation, the interest shall be assessed at 7 
percent. Prejudgment interest may be waived as an inducement to 
voluntary payment. In such cases demand letters should inform the debtor 
that prejudgment interest will be collected if suit becomes necessary. 
When a debt is paid in installments and interest is collected, 
installment payments will first be applied to the payment of accrued 
interest and then to principal in accordance with the so-called ``U.S. 
Rule'' unless a different rule is prescribed by statute, contract or 
regulation. Prejudgment interest shall not be demanded or collected on 
civil penalty and forfeiture claims unless the statute under which the 
claim arises authorizes the collection of such interest.
    (f) Omission not a defense. Failure to comply with any standard 
prescribed in 4 CFR Chapter II or in this subpart shall not be available 
as a defense to any debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.9  Standards for compromise of claims.

    (a) Compromise offer. An offer to compromise may be accepted (1) if 
there is real doubt concerning the National Endowment for the Arts' 
ability to prove its case in court for the full amount claimed; (2) if 
the cost of collecting the

[[Page 350]]

claim does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount; (3) 
if in connection with statutory penalties or forfeitures established as 
an aid to enforcement and to compel compliance, the National Endowment 
for the Arts' enforcement policy will be adequately served by acceptance 
of the sum to be agreed upon, or (4) for other reasons deemed valid by 
the General Counsel (or his designee) and made a part of the claim 
record.
    (b) Documentary evidence of compromise. No compromise of a claim 
shall be final or binding on the Endowment unless it is in writing and 
signed by the appropriate officer who has authority to compromise the 
claim pursuant to this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.10  Standards for suspension or termination of collection action.

    (a) Suspension of collection action. Collection action shall be 
suspended temporarily on a claim when the debtor cannot be located after 
diligent effort but there is reason to believe that future collection 
action may be sufficiently productive to justify periodic review and 
action on the claim, having consideration for its size and the amount 
which may be realized. Collection action may be suspended temporarily on 
a claim when the debtor owns no substantial equity in realty and is 
presently unable to make payment on the National Endowment for the Arts' 
claim or effect a compromise, but his future prospects justify retention 
of the claim for periodic review and action and (1) the applicable 
statute of limitations has been tolled or started anew or (2) future 
collection can be effected by offset notwithstanding the statute of 
limitations. Suspension as to a particular debtor should not defer the 
early liquidation of security for the debt.
    (b) Termination of collection action. Collection action may be 
terminated and the Endowment file closed for the following reasons: (1) 
No substantial amount can be collected; (2) the debtor cannot be 
located; (3) the cost will exceed recovery; (4) the claim is legally 
without merit; or (5) the claim cannot be substantiated by evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.11  Referral to GAO or Justice Department.

    (a) Claims referred. Claims which cannot be collected, compromised, 
or terminated in accordance with 4 CFR parts 101 to 105 will be referred 
to the General Accounting Office in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 71 or to 
the Department of Justice if the Endowment has been granted an exception 
from referrals to the General Accounting Office. Also, if there is doubt 
as to whether collection action should be suspended or terminated on a 
claim, the claim may be referred to the General Accounting Office for 
advice. When recovery of a judgment is prerequisite to imposition of 
administrative sanctions, the claim may be referred to the Justice 
Department for litigation even though termination of collection activity 
might otherwise be considered.
    (b) Prompt referral. Such referrals shall be made as early as 
possible consistent with aggressive collection action and in any event, 
well within the statute of limitations for bringing suit against the 
debtor.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 1151.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to implement section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which is designed to eliminate 
discrimination on the basis of handicap in any program or activity 
receiving Federal financial assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 1151.2  Application.

    This part applies to each recipient of financial assistance from the 
National Endowment for the Arts and to each program or activity that 
receives or benefits from such assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 1151.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part, the term:
    (a) The Act means the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Public Law 93-112, 
as amended by the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1974, (Pub. L. 93-
516, 29 U.S.C. 706 et seq.) and the Comprehensive Rehabilitation 
Services Amendments of 1978, (Pub. L. 95-602).
    (b) Section 504 means section 504 of the Act.
    (c) Endowment means the National Endowment for the Arts.
    (d) Chairman means the Chairman, National Endowment for the Arts.
    (e) Recipient means any state or its political subdivision, any 
instrumentality of a state or its political subdivision, any public or 
private agency, institution, organization, or other entity, or any 
person to which federal financial assistance is extended directly or 
through another recipient, including any successor, assignee, or 
transferee of a recipient, but excluding the ultimate beneficiary of the 
assistance.
    (f) Federal financial assistance means any grant, loan, contract 
(other than a procurement contract or a contract of insurance or 
guaranty), or any other arrangement by which the Endowment provides or 
otherwise makes available assistance in the form of:
    (1) Funds;
    (2) Services of federal personnel; or
    (3) Real and personal property or any interest in or use of such 
property, including:
    (i) Transfers of leases of such property for less than fair market 
value or for reduced consideration; and,
    (ii) proceeds from a subsequent transfer or lease of such property 
if the federal share of its fair market value is not returned to the 
Federal Government.
    (g) Facility means all or any portion of buildings, structures, 
equipment, roads, walks, parking lots, or other real or personal 
property or interest in such property.


<R05>
Sec. 1151.4  Notice.

    (a) A recipient shall take appropriate initial and continuing steps 
to notify participants, beneficiaries, applicants, and employees, 
including those with impaired vision or hearing, and unions or 
professional organizations holding collective bargaining or professional 
agreements with the recipient that it does not discriminate on the basis 
of handicap in violation of section 504 and this part. The notification 
shall state, where appropriate, that the recipient does not discriminate 
in admission or access to, or employment in, its programs and 
activities. Methods of initial and continuing notification may include 
the posting of notices, publication in print, audio, and visual media, 
placement of notices in a recipient's publication, and distribution of 
other written and verbal communications.
    (b) If a recipient publishes or uses recruitment materials or 
publications containing general information that it makes available to 
participants, beneficiaries, applicants, or employees, it

[[Page 352]]

shall include in those materials or publications a statement of the 
policy described in paragraph (a) of this section. A recipient may meet 
the requirement of this paragraph either by including appropriate 
inserts in existing materials and publications or by revising and 
reprinting the materials and publications.


<R05>
Sec. 1151.5  Inconsistent State laws and effect of employment opportunities.

    (a) Recipients are not excused from complying with this part as a 
result of state or local laws which limit the eligibility of handicapped 
persons to receive services or to practice a profession or occupation.
    (b) The presence of limited employment opportunities in a particular 
profession does not excuse a recipient from complying with the 
regulation. For example, a music school receiving Endowment financial 
assistance could not deny admission to a qualified blind applicant 
because a blind singer may experience more difficulty than a 
nonhandicapped singer in finding a job.


<R05>
Secs. 1151.6--1151.10  [Reserved]


<R04>
    Subpart B--Standards for Determining Who Are Handicapped Persons

    (a) Handicapped person means any person who has a physical or mental 
impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, 
has a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an 
impairment. For purposes of section 504, in connection with employment, 
this term does not include any individual who is an alcoholic or drug 
abuser whose current use of alcohol or drugs prevents such individual 
from performing the duties of the job in question or whose employment, 
by reason of such current alcohol or drug abuse, would constitute a 
direct threat to the property or safety of others.
    (b) As used in paragraph (a) of this section, the phrase:
    (1) Physical or mental impairment means:
    (i) Any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, 
or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems: 
Neurological; musculoskeletal; special sense organs; respiratory, 
including speech organs; cardiovascular; reproductive; digestive; 
genito-urinary; hemic and lymphatic; skin; and endocrine; or
    (ii) Any mental or psychological disorder, such as mental 
retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional and mental illness, and 
specific learning disabilities. The term physical or mental impairment 
includes, but is not limited to, such diseases and conditions as 
orthopedic, visual, speech, and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, 
epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, heart disease, 
diabetes, mental retardation, emotional illness, and drug addiction and 
alcoholism.
    (2) Major life activities means functions such as caring for one's 
self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, 
breathing, learning, and working.
    (3) Has a record of such an impairment means has a history of, or 
has been misclassified as having, a mental or physical impairment that 
substantially limits one or more major life activities.
    (4) Is regarded as having an impairment means:
    (i) Has a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially 
limit major life activities but that is treated by a recipient as 
constituting such a limitation;
    (ii) Has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits 
major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others toward 
such impairment;
    (iii) Has none of the impairments defined in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section but is treated by a recipient as having such an impairment.


<R05>

                                 General


<R05>
Sec. 1151.16  General prohibitions against discrimination.

    (a) No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, 
be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or 
otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity 
which receives or benefits from federal financial assistance.
    (b) These regulations do not prohibit the exclusion of 
nonhandicapped persons or persons with a specific type of handicap from 
the benefits of a program limited by Federal statute or executive order 
to handicapped persons or persons with a different type of handicap.
    (c) Recipients shall take appropriate steps to insure that no 
handicapped individual is denied the benefits of, excluded from 
participation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination in any 
program receiving or benefiting from Endowment financial assistance 
because of the absence of appropriate auxiliary aids for individuals 
with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills.
    (d) Recipients shall take appropriate steps to insure that 
communications with their applicants, employees, and beneficiaries are 
available to persons with impaired vision and hearing.
    (e) Recipients shall administer programs and activities in the most 
integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped 
persons.


<R05>
Sec. 1151.17  Specific discriminatory actions prohibited.

    (a) A recipient, in providing any aid, benefit, service, or program 
either directly or through contractual, licensing, or other 
arrangements, shall not, on the basis of handicap:
    (1) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, program, or service;
    (2) Afford a qualified handicapped person an opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not 
equal to that afforded others;
    (3) Provide a qualified handicapped person with an aid, benefit, or 
service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to 
obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same 
level of achievement as that provided to others;
    (4) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to 
handicapped persons or to any class of handicapped persons unless such 
action is necessary to provide qualified handicapped persons with aid, 
benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;
    (5) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified handicapped 
person by providing significant assistance to an agency, organization, 
or person that discriminates on the basis of handicap in providing any 
aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of the recipient's program;
    (6) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to 
participate as a member of planning or advisory boards; or
    (7) Otherwise limit a qualified handicapped person in the enjoyment 
of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others 
receiving an aid, benefit, or service.
    (b) Despite the existence of separate or different programs or 
activities provided in accordance with this part, a recipient may not 
deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate in 
such programs or activities that are not separate or different.
    (c) A recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other 
arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration:
    (1) That have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons 
to discrimination on the basis of handicap;
    (2) That have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially 
impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient's program 
with respect to handicapped persons; or

[[Page 354]]

    (3) That perpetuate the discrimination of another recipient if both 
recipients are subject to common administrative control or are agencies 
of the same state.
    (d) A recipient may not, in determining the site or location of a 
facility, make selections:
    (1) That have the effect of excluding handicapped persons from, 
denying them the benefits of, or otherwise subjecting them to 
discrimination under any program or activity that receives or benefits 
from federal financial assistance; or
    (2) That have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially 
impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the program or 
activity with respect to handicapped persons.
    (e) As used in this section, the aid, benefit, or service provided 
under a program or activity receiving or benefiting from federal 
financial assistance includes any aid, benefit, or service provided in 
or through a facility that has been constructed, expanded, altered, 
leased or rented, or otherwise acquired, in whole or in part, with 
federal financial assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 1151.18  Illustrative examples.

    (a) The following examples will illustrate the application of the 
foregoing provisions to some of the activities funded by the National 
Endowment for the Arts.
    (1) A museum exhibition catalogue or small press editions supported 
by the Endowment may be made usable by the blind and the visually 
impaired through cassette tapes, records, discs, braille, readers and 
simultaneous publications;
    (2) A theatre performance supported by Federal funds may be made 
available to deaf and hearing impaired persons through the use of a sign 
language interpreter or by providing scripts in advance of the 
performance.
    (3) A performing arts organization receiving Federal funds for a 
specific program offered in an inaccessible facility may arrange to 
provide a reasonable opportunity for that program to be offered to the 
public at large in an alternative accessible space; e.g., a theatre 
offering four different plays a season may offer at least one 
performance of each play in an alternative accessible space.
    (4) Recipients of federal funds should make every effort to assure 
that they do not support organizations or individuals that discriminate;
    (5) A handicapped person with experience and expertise equal to 
qualification standards established by a planning or advisory board may 
not be excluded from participation on the board on the basis of 
handicap. This does not mean that every planning or advisory board 
necessarily must include a handicapped person.
    (b) Despite the existence of permissible separate or different 
programs, e.g., periodic performances in alternative accessible spaces, 
a physically handicapped person who wishes to be, and can be, escorted 
to a seat, may not be denied such access to an otherwise inaccessible 
theatre.
    (c) State arts agencies are obligated to develop methods of 
administering federal funds so as to ensure that handicapped persons are 
not subjected to discrimination on the basis of handicap either by sub-
grantees or by the manner in which the funds are distributed.
    (d) In the event Endowment funds are utilized to construct, expand, 
alter, lease or rent a facility, the benefits of the programs and 
activities provided in or through that facility must be conducted in 
accordance with these regulations, e.g., a museum receiving a grant to 
renovate an existing facility must assure that all museum programs and 
activities conducted in that facility are accessible to handicapped 
persons.
    (e) In carrying out the mandate of section 504 and these 
implementing regulations recipients should make every effort to 
administer Endowment assisted programs and activities in a setting in 
which able-bodied and disabled persons are integrated, e.g., tours made 
available to the hearing impaired should be open to the public at large 
and everyone should be permitted to enjoy the benefits of a tactile 
experience in a museum.

                          Program Accessibility


<R05>
Sec. 1151.21  Discrimination prohibited.

    No qualified handicapped person shall, because a recipient's 
facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be 
denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise 
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity to which 
this part applies.


<R05>
Sec. 1151.22  Existing facilities.

    (a) A recipient shall operate each program or activity to which this 
part applies so that the program or activity, when viewed in its 
entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. 
This paragraph does not necessarily require a recipient to make each of 
its existing facilities or every part of a facility accessible to and 
usable by handicapped persons.
    (b) A recipient may comply with the requirement of paragraph (a) of 
this section through alteration of existing facilities, the construction 
of new facilities, or any other methods that result in making its 
program or activity accessible to handicapped persons. A recipient is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with paragraph (a) 
of this section. In choosing among available methods for meeting the 
requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall give 
priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to 
handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (c) Time period. A recipient shall comply with the requirement of 
paragraph (a) of this section within sixty days of the effective date of 
this part except that where structural changes are necessary to make 
programs or activities in existing facilities accessible such changes 
shall be made as soon as possible but in no event later than three years 
after the effective date of this part.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event structural changes to facilities 
are necessary to meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, 
a recipient shall develop, within one year of the effective date of this 
part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete 
such changes. The plan shall be developed with the assistance of 
interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations 
representing handicapped persons. Upon request, the recipient shall make 
available for public inspection a copy of the transition plan. The plan 
shall, at a minimum:
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its program or activity to handicapped 
persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
full program accessibility and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the person responsible for implementation of the plan.


<R05>
Sec. 1151.23  New construction.

    (a) Design, construction, and alteration. New facilities shall be 
designed and constructed to be readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. Alterations to existing facilities shall, to the 
maximum extent feasible, be designed and constructed to be readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.
    (b) Conformance with Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards. (1) 
Effective as of January 18, 1991, design, construction, or alteration of 
buildings in conformance with sections 3-8 of the Uniform Federal 
Accessibility Standards (USAF) (appendix A to 41 CFR subpart 101-19.6) 
shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with 
respect to those buildings. Departures from particular technical and 
scoping requirements of UFAS by the use of other methods are permitted 
where substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of the 
building is provided.
    (2) For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall 
be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical 
rooms

[[Page 356]]

and other spaces that, because of their intended use, will not require 
accessibility to the public or beneficiaries or result in the employment 
or residence therein of persons with physical handicaps.
    (3) This section does not require recipients to make building 
alterations that have little likelihood of being accomplished without 
removing or altering a load-bearing structural member.

recipient, is shown to be job-related for the position in question; and
    (2) Alternative job-related tests or criteria are unavailable.
    (b) A recipient shall select and administer tests concerning 
employment so as best to ensure that, when administered to an applicant 
or employee who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking 
skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's or 
employee's job skills, aptitude, or other factors relevant to adequate 
performance of the job in question.


<R05>
Sec. 1151.34  Preemployment inquiries.

    A recipient may not, except as provided below, conduct a

whether the applicant is a handicapped person, or inquire as to the 
nature or severity of a handicap. A recipient may, however, make 
preemployment inquiry into an applicant's ability to perform job-related 
functions.
    (a) When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the 
effects of past discrimination, when a recipient is taking voluntary 
action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited 
participation in its federally assisted program or activity, or when a 
recipient is taking affirmative action pursuant to section 504 of the 
Act, the recipient may invite applicants for employment to indicate 
whether and to what extent they are handicapped, provided, that:

affirmative action efforts; and
    (2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being 
requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, that refusal to provide it 
will not subject the applicant or employee to any adverse treatment, and 
that it will be used only in accordance with this part.
    (b) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from 
conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical 
examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty, 
provided, that:

regardless of handicap; and
    (2) The results of such an examination are used only in accordance 
with the requirements of this part.

medical records, except that:

on the work or duties of handicapped persons and regarding necessary 
accommodations;
    (2) First aid and safety personnel may be informed, where 
appropriate, if the condition might require emergency treatment; and

conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and procedures 
of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or 
activities.


<R05>
Secs. 1153.141--1153.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1153.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1153.150, no qualified 
handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1153.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does 
not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 1153.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate

[[Page 366]]

accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of 
new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods 
that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to 
and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make 
structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are 
effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in 
making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility 
requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), and any regulations 
implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the 
requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those 
methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped 
persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 1153.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped 
persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is 
not required because of Sec. 1153.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative 
methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through 
portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting 
forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall 
provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped 
persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped 
persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 1153.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the 
Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.


<R05>
Secs. 1153.152--1153.159  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1153.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall

[[Page 367]]

give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 1153.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services 
of the program or activity.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this 
section applies to all allegations of discrimination on the basis of 
handicap in programs or activities conducted by the agency.
    (b) The agency shall process complaints alleging violations of 
section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1613 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29

coordinating implementation of this section. Complaints may be sent to 
the Office of General Counsel, National Endowment for the Arts, 1100 
Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20506.
    (d) The agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints 
for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed 
within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may 
extend this time period for good cause.
    (e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have 
jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government 
entity.
    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), or section 502 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), is not readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.
    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which

receipt of the additional information to make his or her determination 
on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section

    (a) Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 provides that, to the extent 
permitted by law, Executive departments and agencies shall participate 
in a governmentwide system for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. 
A person who is debarred or suspended shall be excluded from Federal 
financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under Federal 
programs and activities. Debarment or suspension of a participant in a 
program by one agency shall have governmentwide effect.
    (b) These regulations implement section 3 of E.O. 12549 and the 
guidelines promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget under 
section 6 of the E.O. by:
    (1) Prescribing the programs and activities that are covered by the 
governmentwide system;

excluded themselves from participation in covered transactions;
    (4) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, 
determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion; and
    (5) Offering such other guidance as necessary for the effective 
implementation and administration of the governmentwide system.
    (c) These regulations also implement Executive Order 12689 (3 CFR, 
1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Public Law 103-355, sec. 
2455, 108 Stat. 3327) by--
    (1) Providing for the inclusion in the List of Parties Excluded from 
Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs all persons proposed for 
debarment, debarred or suspended under the Federal Acquisition

governmentwide exclusions have been entered under this part; and persons 
determined to be ineligible; and
    (2) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, 
determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion.
    (d) Although these regulations cover the listing of ineligible

<R05>
Sec. 1154.110  Coverage.

    (a) These regulations apply to all persons who have participated, 
are currently participating or may reasonably be expected to participate 
in transactions under Federal nonprocurement programs. For purposes of 
these regulations such transactions will be referred to as ``covered 
transactions.''
    (1) Covered transaction. For purposes of these regulations, a 
covered transaction is a primary covered transaction or a lower tier 
covered transaction. Covered transactions at any tier need not involve 
the transfer of Federal funds.
    (i) Primary covered transaction. Except as noted in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section, a primary covered transaction is any nonprocurement 
transaction between an agency and a person, regardless of type, 
including: grants, cooperative agreements, scholarships, fellowships, 
contracts of assistance, loans, loan guarantees, subsidies, insurance, 
payments for specified use, donation agreements and any other 
nonprocurement transactions between a Federal agency and a person. 
Primary covered transactions also include those transactions specially 
designated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in 
such agency's regulations governing debarment and suspension.
    (ii) Lower tier covered transaction. A lower tier covered 
transaction is:
    (A) Any transaction between a participant and a person other than a 
procurement contract for goods or services, regardless of type, under a 
primary covered transaction.
    (B) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a 
participant and a person, regardless of type, expected to equal or 
exceed the Federal procurement small purchase threshold fixed at 10 
U.S.C. 2304(g) and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) (currently $25,000) under a primary 
covered transaction.
    (C) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a 
participant and a person under a covered transaction, regardless of 
amount, under which that person will have a critical influence on or 
substantive control over that covered transaction. Such persons are:
    (1) Principal investigators.
    (2) Providers of federally-required audit services.
    (2) Exceptions. The following transactions are not covered:
    (i) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier 
awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including 
deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;
    (ii) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international 
organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign 
government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, entities 
consisting wholly or partially

[[Page 372]]

of foreign governments or foreign governmental entities;
    (iii) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without 
regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received 
in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);
    (iv) Federal employment;
    (v) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized 
emergencies or disasters;
    (vi) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental 
operations; and
    (vii) Other transactions where the application of these regulations 
would be prohibited by law.
    (b) Relationship to other sections. This section describes the types 
of transactions to which a debarment or suspension under the regulations 
will apply. Subpart B, ``Effect of Action,'' Sec. 1154.200, ``Debarment 
or suspension,'' sets forth the consequences of a debarment or 
suspension. Those consequences would obtain only with respect to 
participants and principals in the covered transactions and activities 
described in Sec. 1154.110(a). Sections 1154.325, ``Scope of 
debarment,'' and 1154.420, ``Scope of suspension,'' govern the extent to 
which a specific participant or organizational elements of a participant 
would be automatically included within a debarment or suspension action, 
and the conditions under which affiliates or persons associated with a 
participant may also be brought within the scope of the action.
    (c) Relationship to Federal procurement activities. In accordance 
with E.O. 12689 and section 2455 of Public Law 103-355, any debarment, 
suspension, proposed debarment or other governmentwide exclusion 
initiated under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) on or after 
August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for Executive 
Branch agencies and participants as an exclusion under this regulation. 
Similarly, any debarment, suspension or other governmentwide exclusion 
initiated under this regulation on or after August 25, 1995 shall be 
recognized by and effective for those agencies as a debarment or 
suspension under the FAR.

June 26, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1154.115  Policy.

    (a) In order to protect the public interest, it is the policy of the 
Federal Government to conduct business only with responsible persons. 
Debarment and suspension are discretionary actions that, taken in 
accordance with Executive Order 12549 and these regulations, are 
appropriate means to implement this policy.
    (b) Debarment and suspension are serious actions which shall be used 
only in the public interest and for the Federal Government's protection 
and not for purposes of punishment. Agencies may impose debarment or 
suspension for the causes and in accordance with the procedures set 
forth in these regulations.
    (c) When more than one agency has an interest in the proposed 
debarment or suspension of a person, consideration shall be given to 
designating one agency as the lead agency for making the decision. 
Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for 
coordinating their debarment or suspension actions.

debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4. Accordingly, no agency shall 
enter into primary covered transactions with such excluded persons 
during such period, except as permitted pursuant to Sec. 1154.215.
    (b) Lower tier covered transactions. Except to the extent prohibited 
by law, persons who have been proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 
9, subpart 9.4, debarred or suspended shall be excluded from 
participating as either participants or principals in all lower tier 
covered transactions (see Sec. 1154.110(a)(1)(ii)) for the period of 
their exclusion.

[[Page 373]]

    (c) Exceptions. Debarment or suspension does not affect a person's 
eligibility for--
    (1) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier 
awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including 
deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;
    (2) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international 
organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign 
government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, and 
entities consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or 
foreign governmental entities;
    (3) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without 
regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received 
in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);
    (4) Federal employment;
    (5) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized 
emergencies or disasters;
    (6) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental

excluded in accordance with the applicable statutory, executive order, 
or regulatory authority.


<R05>
Sec. 1154.210  Voluntary exclusion.

    Persons who accept voluntary exclusions under Sec. 1154.315 are 
excluded in accordance with the terms of their settlements. Arts 
Endowment shall, and participants may, contact the original action

<R05>
Sec. 1154.215  Exception provision.

    The Arts Endowment may grant an exception permitting a debarred, 
suspended, or voluntarily excluded person, or a person proposed for 
debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, to participate in a 
particular covered transaction upon a written determination by the 
agency head or an authorized designee stating the reason(s) for 
deviating from the Presidential policy established by Executive Order 
12549 and Sec. 1154.200. However, in accordance with the President's 
stated intention in the Executive Order, exceptions shall be granted

Sec. 1154.220  Continuation of covered transactions.

    (a) Notwithstanding the debarment, suspension, proposed debarment 
under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, determination of ineligibility, or 
voluntary exclusion of any person by an agency, agencies and 
participants may continue covered transactions in existence at the time 
the person was debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR 
part 9, subpart 9.4, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded. A 
decision as to the type of termination action, if any, to be taken 
should be made only after thorough review to ensure the propriety of the 
proposed action.
    (b) Agencies and participants shall not renew or extend covered 
transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any person who is 
debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 
9.4, ineligible or voluntary excluded, except as provided in 
Sec. 1154.215.

[60 FR 33041, 33062, June 26, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1154.225  Failure to adhere to restrictions.

    (a) Except as permitted under Sec. 1154.215 or Sec. 1154.220, a 
participant shall not knowingly do business under a covered transaction

    (1) Debarred or suspended;
    (2) Proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; or
    (3) Ineligible for or voluntarily excluded from the covered 
transaction.
    (b) Violation of the restriction under paragraph (a) of this section 
may result in disallowance of costs, annulment or termination of award, 
issuance of a stop work order, debarment or suspension, or other 
remedies as appropriate.

[[Page 374]]

    (c) A participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective 
participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it and its 
principals are not debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 
CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the 
covered transaction (See Appendix B of these regulations), unless it 
knows that the certification is erroneous. An agency has the burden of 
proof that a participant did knowingly do business with a person that 
filed an erroneous certification.

    The debarring official may debar a person for any of the causes in 
Sec. 1154.305, using procedures established in Secs. 1154.310 through 
1154.314. The existence of a cause for debarment, however, does not 
necessarily require that the person be debarred; the seriousness of the 
person's acts or omissions and any mitigating factors shall be 
considered in making any debarment decision.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 1154.310  Procedures.

    Arts Endowment shall process debarment actions as informally as 
practicable, consistent with the principles of fundamental fairness,

[[Page 375]]


<R05>
Sec. 1154.311  Investigation and referral.

    Information concerning the existence of a cause for debarment from 
any source shall be promptly reported, investigated, and referred, when 
appropriate, to the debarring official for consideration. After 
consideration, the debarring official may issue a notice of proposed 
debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 1154.312  Notice of proposed debarment.

    A debarment proceeding shall be initiated by notice to the 
respondent advising:
    (a) That debarment is being considered;
    (b) Of the reasons for the proposed debarment in terms sufficient to 
put the respondent on notice of the conduct or transaction(s) upon which 
it is based;
    (c) Of the cause(s) relied upon under Sec. 1154.305 for proposing 
debarment;
    (d) Of the provisions of Sec. 1154.311 through Sec. 1154.314, and 
any other Arts Endowment procedures, if applicable, governing debarment 
decisionmaking; and

<R05>
Sec. 1154.313  Opportunity to contest proposed debarment.

    (a) Submission in opposition. Within 30 days after receipt of the 
notice of proposed debarment, the respondent may submit, in person, in 
writing, or through a representative, information and argument in 
opposition to the proposed debarment.
    (b) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. (1) In 
actions not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, if the debarring 
official finds that the respondent's submission in opposition raises a 
genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment, 
respondent(s) shall be afforded an opportunity to appear with a 
representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and 
confront any witness the agency presents.
    (2) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be made 
available at cost to the respondent, upon request, unless the respondent 
and the agency, by mutual agreement, waive the requirement for a 
transcript.


<R05>
Sec. 1154.314  Debarring official's decision.

    (a) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions based upon a 
conviction or civil judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute 
over material facts, the debarring official shall make a decision on the 
basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any 
submission made by the respondent. The decision shall be made within 45 
days after receipt of any information and argument submitted by the 
respondent, unless the debarring official extends this period for good 
cause.
    (b) Additional proceedings necessary. (1) In actions in which 
additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material 
facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared. The debarring 
official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with 
any information and argument submitted by the respondent and any other 
information in the administrative record.
    (2) The debarring official may refer disputed material facts to 
another official for findings of fact. The debarring official may reject 
any such findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically 
determining them to be arbitrary and capricious or clearly erroneous.
    (3) The debarring official's decision shall be made after the 
conclusion of the proceedings with respect to disputed facts.
    (c) (1) Standard of proof. In any debarment action, the cause for 
debarment must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. Where 
the proposed debarment is based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the 
standard shall be deemed to have been met.
    (2) Burden of proof. The burden of proof is on the agency proposing 
debarment.
    (d) Notice of debarring official's decision. (1) If the debarring 
official decides to impose debarment, the respondent shall be given 
prompt notice:
    (i) Referring to the notice of proposed debarment;
    (ii) Specifying the reasons for debarment;
    (iii) Stating the period of debarment, including effective dates; 
and
    (iv) Advising that the debarment is effective for covered 
transactions throughout the executive branch of the

[[Page 376]]

Federal Government unless an agency head or an authorized designee makes 
the determination referred to in Sec. 1154.215.
    (2) If the debarring official decides not to impose debarment, the 
respondent shall be given prompt notice of that decision. A decision not 
to impose debarment shall be without prejudice to a subsequent 
imposition of debarment by any other agency.


<R05>

    (a) When in the best interest of the Government, Arts Endowment may, 
at any time, settle a debarment or suspension action.

of the participant, such voluntary exclusion shall be entered on the

<R05>
Sec. 1154.320  Period of debarment.

    (a) Debarment shall be for a period commensurate with the 
seriousness of the cause(s). If a suspension precedes a debarment, the 
suspension period shall be considered in determining the debarment 
period.
    (1) Debarment for causes other than those related to a violation of 
the requirements of subpart F of this part generally should not exceed 
three years. Where circumstances warrant, a longer period of debarment 
may be imposed.

of subpart F of this part (see 1154.305(c)(5)), the period of debarment 
shall not exceed five years.
    (b) The debarring official may extend an existing debarment for an 
additional period, if that official determines that an extension is 
necessary to protect the public interest. However, a debarment may not 
be extended solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon 
which the initial debarment action was based. If debarment for an 
additional period is determined to be necessary, the procedures of 
Secs. 1154.311 through 1154.314 shall be followed to extend the 
debarment.
    (c) The respondent may request the debarring official to reverse the 
debarment decision or to reduce the period or scope of debarment. Such a 
request shall be in writing and supported by documentation. The 
debarring official may grant such a request for reasons including, but 
not limited to:
    (1) Newly discovered material evidence;
    (2) Reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which the 
debarment was based;
    (3) Bona fide change in ownership or management;
    (4) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; 
or
    (5) Other reasons the debarring official deems appropriate.

Sec. 1154.325  Scope of debarment.

    (a) Scope in general. (1) Debarment of a person under these 
regulations constitutes debarment of all its divisions and other 
organizational elements from all covered transactions, unless the 
debarment decision is limited by its terms to one or more specifically 
identified individuals, divisions or other organizational elements or to 
specific types of transactions.
    (2) The debarment action may include any affiliate of the 
participant that is specifically named and given notice of the proposed 
debarment and an opportunity to respond (see Secs. 1154.311 through 
1154.314).
    (b) Imputing conduct. For purposes of determining the scope of 
debarment, conduct may be imputed as follows:
    (1) Conduct imputed to participant. The fraudulent, criminal or 
other seriously improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, 
partner, employee, or other individual associated with a participant may 
be imputed to the participant when the conduct occurred in connection 
with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of the 
participant, or with the participant's knowledge, approval, or 
acquiescence. The participant's acceptance of the benefits derived from 
the conduct shall be evidence of such knowledge, approval, or 
acquiescence.
    (2) Conduct imputed to individuals associated with participant. The 
fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper

[[Page 377]]

conduct of a participant may be imputed to any officer, director, 
shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with the 
participant who participated in, knew of, or had reason to know of the 
participant's conduct.
    (3) Conduct of one participant imputed to other participants in a 
joint venture. The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper 
conduct of one participant in a joint venture, grant pursuant to a joint 
application, or similar arrangement may be imputed to other participants 
if the conduct occurred for or on behalf of the joint venture, grant 
pursuant to a joint application, or similar arrangement may be imputed 
to other participants if the conduct occurred for or on behalf of the 
joint venture, grant pursuant to a joint application, or similar 
arrangement or with the knowledge, approval, or acquiescence of these 
participants. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct shall 
be evidence of such knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.

<R05>
Sec. 1154.400  General.

    (a) The suspending official may suspend a person for any of the 
causes in Sec. 1154.405 using procedures established in Secs. 1154.410 
through 1154.413.
    (b) Suspension is a serious action to be imposed only when:
    (1) There exists adequate evidence of one or more of the causes set 
out in Sec. 1154.405, and
    (2) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.
    (c) In assessing the adequacy of the evidence, the agency should 
consider how much information is available, how credible it is given the 
circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, 
and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. This assessment 
should include an examination of basic documents such as grants, 
cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, and contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 1154.405  Causes for suspension.

    (a) Suspension may be imposed in accordance with the provisions of 
Secs. 1154.400 through 1154.413 upon adequate evidence:
    (1) To suspect the commission of an offense listed in 
Sec. 1154.305(a); or
    (2) That a cause for debarment under Sec. 1154.305 may exist.
    (b) Indictment shall constitute adequate evidence for purposes of 
suspension actions.


<R05>
Sec. 1154.410  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral. Information concerning the existence 
of a cause for suspension from any source shall be promptly reported, 
investigated, and referred, when appropriate, to the suspending official 
for consideration. After consideration, the suspending official may 
issue a notice of suspension.
    (b) Decisionmaking process. Arts Endowment shall process suspension 
actions as informally as practicable, consistent with principles of 
fundamental fairness, using the procedures in Sec. 1154.411 through 
Sec. 1154.413.


<R05>
Sec. 1154.411  Notice of suspension.

    When a respondent is suspended, notice shall immediately be given:
    (a) That suspension has been imposed;
    (b) That the suspension is based on an indictment, conviction, or 
other adequate evidence that the respondent has committed irregularities 
seriously reflecting on the propriety of further Federal Government 
dealings with the respondent;
    (c) Describing any such irregularities in terms sufficient to put 
the respondent on notice without disclosing the Federal Government's 
evidence;
    (d) Of the cause(s) relied upon under Sec. 1154.405 for imposing 
suspension;
    (e) That the suspension is for a temporary period pending the 
completion of an investigation or ensuing legal, debarment, or Program 
Fraud Civil Remedies Act proceedings;
    (f) Of the provisions of Secs. 1154.411 through 1154.413 and any 
other Arts Endowment procedures, if applicable, governing suspension 
decisionmaking; and

[[Page 378]]


<R05>
Sec. 1154.412  Opportunity to contest suspension.

    (a) Submission in opposition. Within 30 days after receipt of the 
notice of suspension, the respondent may submit, in person, in writing, 
or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to 
the suspension.
    (b) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. (1) If the 
suspending official finds that the respondent's submission in opposition 
raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension, 
respondent(s) shall be afforded an opportunity to appear with a 
representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and 
confront any witness the agency presents, unless:
    (i) The action is based on an indictment, conviction or civil 
judgment, or
    (ii) A determination is made, on the basis of Department of Justice 
advice, that the substantial interests of the Federal Government in 
pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the 
suspension would be prejudiced.
    (2) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be 
prepared and made available at cost to the respondent, upon request, 
unless the respondent and the agency, by mutual agreement, waive the 
requirement for a transcript.


<R05>
Sec. 1154.413  Suspending official's decision.

    The suspending official may modify or terminate the suspension (for 
example, see Sec. 1154.320(c) for reasons for reducing the period or 
scope of debarment) or may leave it in force. However, a decision to 
modify or terminate the suspension shall be without prejudice to the 
subsequent imposition of suspension by any other agency or debarment by 
any agency. The decision shall be rendered in accordance with the 
following provisions:
    (a) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions: based on an 
indictment, conviction, or civil judgment; in which there is no genuine 
dispute over material facts; or in which additional proceedings to 
determine disputed material facts have been denied on the basis of 
Department of Justice advice, the suspending official shall make a 
decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative 
record, including any submission made by the respondent. The decision 
shall be made within 45 days after receipt of any information and 
argument submitted by the respondent, unless the suspending official 
extends this period for good cause.
    (b) Additional proceedings necessary. (1) In actions in which 
additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material 
facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared. The suspending 
official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with 
any information and argument submitted by the respondent and any other 
information in the administrative record.
    (2) The suspending official may refer matters involving disputed 
material facts to another official for findings of fact. The suspending 
official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after 
specifically determining them to be arbitrary or capricious or clearly 
erroneous.
    (c) Notice of suspending official's decision. Prompt written notice 
of the suspending official's decision shall be sent to the respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 1154.415  Period of suspension.

    (a) Suspension shall be for a temporary period pending the 
completion of an investigation or ensuing legal, debarment, or Program 
Fraud Civil Remedies Act proceedings, unless terminated sooner by the 
suspending official or as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) If legal or administrative proceedings are not initiated within 
12 months after the date of the suspension notice, the suspension shall 
be terminated unless an Assistant Attorney General or United States 
Attorney requests its extension in writing, in which case it may be 
extended for an additional six months. In no event may a suspension 
extend beyond 18 months, unless such proceedings have been initiated 
within that period.
    (c) The suspending official shall notify the Department of Justice 
of an impending termination of a suspension, at least 30 days before the 
12-month period expires, to give that Department an opportunity to 
request an extension.

[[Page 379]]


<R05>
Sec. 1154.420  Scope of suspension.

maintain, and distribute a list of all persons who have been debarred, 
suspended, or voluntarily excluded by agencies under Executive Order 
12549 and these regulations, and those who have been determined to be 
ineligible.
    (b) At a minimum, this list shall indicate:
    (1) The names and addresses of all debarred, suspended, ineligible,

debarments, suspension, determinations of ineligibility, and voluntary 
exclusions it has taken. Until February 18, 1989, the agency shall also 
provide GSA and OMB with information concerning all transactions in 
which Arts Endowment has granted exceptions under Sec. 1154.215 
permitting participation by debarred, suspended, or voluntarily excluded 
persons.
    (b) Unless an alternative schedule is agreed to by GSA, the agency 
shall advise GSA of the information set forth in Sec. 1154.500(b) and of 
the exceptions granted under Sec. 1154.215 within five working days 
after taking such actions.
    (c) The agency shall direct inquiries concerning listed persons to 
the agency that took the action.
    (d) Arts Endowment officials shall check the Nonprocurement List 
before entering covered transactions to determine whether a participant

voluntarily excluded (Tel. ).
    (e) Arts Endowment officials shall check the Nonprocurement List 
before approving principals or lower tier participants where agency 
approval of the principal or lower tier participant is required under 
the terms of the transaction, to determine whether such principals or 
participants are debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily 
excluded.


<R05>
Sec. 1154.510  Participants' responsibilities.

    (a) Certification by participants in primary covered transactions. 
Each participant shall submit the certification in appendix A to this 
part for it and its principals at the time the participant submits its 
proposal in connection with a primary covered transaction, except that 
States need only complete such certification as to their principals. 
Participants may decide the method and frequency by which they determine 
the eligibility of their principals. In addition, each participant may, 
but is not required to, check the Nonprocurement List for its principals 
(Tel. ). Adverse information on the certification will not necessarily 
result in denial of participation. However, the certification, and any 
additional information pertaining to the certification submitted by the 
participant, shall be considered in the administration of covered 
transactions.
    (b) Certification by participants in lower tier covered 
transactions. (1) Each participant shall require participants in lower 
tier covered transactions to include the certification in appendix B to 
this part for it and its principals in any proposal submitted in 
connection with such lower tier covered transactions.
    (2) A participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective 
participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it and its 
principals are not

[[Page 380]]

debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the 
covered transaction by any Federal agency, unless it knows that the 
certification is erroneous. Participants may decide the method and 
frequency by which they determine the eligiblity of their principals. In 
addition, a participant may, but is not required to, check the 
Nonprocurement List for its principals and for participants (Tel. ).
    (c) Changed circumstances regarding certification. A participant 
shall provide immediate written notice to Arts Endowment if at any time 
the participant learns that its certification was erroneous when 
submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. 
Participants in lower tier covered transactions shall provide the same 
updated notice to the participant to which it submitted its proposals.

<R05>
Sec. 1154.625  Exception provision.

    The agency head may waive with respect to a particular grant, in 
writing, a suspension of payments under a grant, suspension or

the grant, as provided in appendix C to this part.
    (2) Grantees are not required to make a certification in order to 
continue receiving funds under a grant awarded before March 18, 1989, or 
under a no-cost time extension of such a grant. However, the grantee 
shall make a one-time drug-free workplace certification for a non-
automatic continuation of such a grant made on or after March 18, 1989.
    (b) Except as provided in this section, all grantees shall make the 
required certification for each grant. For mandatory formula grants and 
entitlements that have no application process, grantees shall submit a 
one-time certification in order to continue receiving awards.
    (c) A grantee that is a State may elect to make one certification in 
each Federal fiscal year. States that previously submitted an annual 
certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 
1990 until June 30, 1990. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, this certification shall cover all grants to all State agencies 
from any Federal agency. The State shall retain the original of this

award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with respect 
to each grant, unless the Federal agency has designated a central 
location for submission.
    (d)(1) The Governor of a State may exclude certain State agencies 
from the statewide certification and authorize these agencies to submit 
their own certifications to Federal agencies. The statewide 
certification shall name any State agencies so excluded.
    (2) A State agency to which the statewide certification does not 
apply, or a State agency in a State that does not have a statewide 
certification, may elect to make one certification in each Federal 
fiscal year. State agencies that previously submitted a State agency 
certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 
1990 until June 30, 1990. The State agency shall retain the original of 
this State agency-wide certification in its central office and, prior to 
grant award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with 
respect to each grant, unless the Federal agency designates a central 
location for submission.
    (3) When the work of a grant is done by more than one State agency, 
the certification of the State agency directly receiving the grant shall 
be deemed to certify compliance for all workplaces, including those 
located in other State agencies.
    (e)(1) For a grant of less than 30 days performance duration, 
grantees shall have this policy statement and program in place as soon 
as possible, but in any case by a date prior to the date on which 
performance is expected to be completed.
    (2) For a grant of 30 days or more performance duration, grantees 
shall have this policy statement and program in place within 30 days 
after award.
    (3) Where extraordinary circumstances warrant for a specific grant, 
the grant officer may determine a different date on which the policy 
statement and program shall be in place.


<R05>
Sec. 1154.635  Reporting of and employee sanctions for convictions of criminal drug offenses.

    (a) When a grantee other than an individual is notified that an 
employee has been convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute 
occurring in the workplace, it shall take the following actions:

[[Page 383]]

    (1) Within 10 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, 
the grantee shall provide written notice, including the convicted 
employee's position title, to every grant officer, or other designee on 
whose grant activity the convicted employee was working, unless a 
Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt of such 
notifications. Notification shall include the identification number(s) 
for each of the Federal agency's affected grants.
    (2) Within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, 
the grantee shall do the following with respect to the employee who was 
convicted.
    (i) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to 
and including termination, consistent with requirements of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; or
    (ii) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug 
abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by 
a Federal, State, or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate 
agency.
    (b) A grantee who is an individual who is convicted for a violation 
of a criminal drug statute occurring during the conduct of any grant 
activity shall report the conviction, in writing, within 10 calendar 
days, to his or her Federal agency grant officer, or other designee, 
unless the Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt 
of such notices. Notification shall include the identification number(s) 
for each of the Federal agency's affected grants.

Appendix A to Part 1154--Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, 
     and Other Responsibility Matters--Primary Covered Transactions

                     Instructions for Certification

    1. By signing and submitting this proposal, the prospective primary 
participant is providing the certification set out below.
    2. The inability of a person to provide the certification required 
below will not necessarily result in denial of participation in this 
covered transaction. The prospective participant shall submit an 
explanation of why it cannot provide the certification set out below. 
The certification or explanation will be considered in connection with 
the department or agency's determination whether to enter into this 
transaction. However, failure of the prospective primary participant to 
furnish a certification or an explanation shall disqualify such person 
from participation in this transaction.
    3. The certification in this clause is a material representation of 
fact upon which reliance was placed when the department or agency 
determined to enter into this transaction. If it is later determined 
that the prospective primary participant knowingly rendered an erroneous 
certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal 
Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for 
cause or default.
    4. The prospective primary participant shall provide immediate 
written notice to the department or agency to which this proposal is 
submitted if at any time the prospective primary participant learns that 
its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous 
by reason of changed circumstances.
    5. The terms covered transaction, debarred, suspended, ineligible, 
lower tier covered transaction, participant, person, primary covered 
transaction, principal, proposal, and voluntarily excluded, as used in 
this clause, have the meanings set out in the Definitions and Coverage 
sections of the rules implementing Executive Order 12549. You may 
contact the department or agency to which this proposal is being 
submitted for assistance in obtaining a copy of those regulations.
    6. The prospective primary participant agrees by submitting this

  Appendix C to Part 1154--Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace 
                              Requirements

                     Instructions for Certification

    1. By signing and/or submitting this application or grant agreement, 
the grantee is providing the certification set out below.
    2. The certification set out below is a material representation of 
fact upon which reliance is placed when the agency awards the grant. If 
it is later determined that the grantee knowingly rendered a false 
certification, or otherwise violates the requirements of the Drug-Free 
Workplace Act, the agency, in addition to any other remedies available 
to the Federal Government, may take action authorized under the Drug-
Free Workplace Act.
    3. For grantees other than individuals, Alternate I applies.
    4. For grantees who are individuals, Alternate II applies.
    5. Workplaces under grants, for grantees other than individuals, 
need not be identified on the certification. If known, they may be 
identified in the grant application. If the grantee does not identify 
the workplaces at the time of application, or upon award, if there is no 
application, the grantee must keep the identity of the workplace(s) on 
file in its office and make the information available for Federal 
inspection. Failure to identify all known workplaces constitutes a 
violation of the grantee's drug-free workplace requirements.
    6. Workplace identifications must include the actual address of 
buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the 
grant takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (e.g., all 
vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while 
in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, 
performers in concert halls or radio studios).
    7. If the workplace identified to the agency changes during the 
performance of the grant, the grantee shall inform the agency of the 
change(s), if it previously identified the workplaces in question (see 
paragraph five).
    8. Definitions of terms in the Nonprocurement Suspension and 
Debarment common rule and Drug-Free Workplace common rule apply to this 
certification. Grantees' attention is called, in particular, to the 
following definitions from these rules:
    Controlled substance means a controlled substance in Schedules I 
through V of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812) and as 
further defined by regulation (21 CFR 1308.11 through 1308.15);
    Conviction means a finding of guilt (including a plea of nolo 
contendere) or imposition of sentence, or both, by any judicial body 
charged with the responsibility to determine violations of the Federal 
or State criminal drug statutes;
    Criminal drug statute means a Federal or non-Federal criminal 
statute involving the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, use, or 
possession of any controlled substance;
    Employee means the employee of a grantee directly engaged in the 
performance of work under a grant, including: (i) All direct charge 
employees; (ii) All indirect charge employees unless their impact or 
involvement is insignificant to the performance of the grant;

[[Page 386]]

and, (iii) Temporary personnel and consultants who are directly engaged 
in the performance of work under the grant and who are on the grantee's 
payroll. This definition does not include workers not on the payroll of 
the grantee (e.g., volunteers, even if used to meet a matching 
requirement; consultants or independent contractors not on the grantee's 
payroll; or employees of subrecipients or subcontractors in covered 
workplaces).

        Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace Requirements

             Alternate I. (Grantees Other Than Individuals)

    A. The grantee certifies that it will or will continue to provide a 
drug-free workplace by:
    (a) Publishing a statement notifying employees that the unlawful 
manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a 
controlled substance is prohibited in the grantee's workplace and 
specifying the actions that will be taken against employees for 
violation of such prohibition;
    (b) Establishing an ongoing drug-free awareness program to inform 
employees about--
    (1) The dangers of drug abuse in the workplace;
    (2) The grantee's policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace;
    (3) Any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee 
assistance programs; and
    (4) The penalties that may be imposed upon employees for drug abuse 
violations occurring in the workplace;
    (c) Making it a requirement that each employee to be engaged in the 
performance of the grant be given a copy of the statement required by 
paragraph (a);
    (d) Notifying the employee in the statement required by paragraph 
(a) that, as a condition of employment under the grant, the employee 
will--
    (1) Abide by the terms of the statement; and
    (2) Notify the employer in writing of his or her conviction for a 
violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace no later 
than five calendar days after such conviction;
    (e) Notifying the agency in writing, within ten calendar days after 
receiving notice under paragraph (d)(2) from an employee or otherwise 
receiving actual notice of such conviction. Employers of convicted 
employees must provide notice, including position title, to every grant 
officer or other designee on whose grant activity the convicted employee 
was working, unless the Federal agency has designated a central point 
for the receipt of such notices. Notice shall include the identification 
number(s) of each affected grant;
    (f) Taking one of the following actions, within 30 calendar days of 
receiving notice under paragraph (d)(2), with respect to any employee 
who is so convicted--
    (1) Taking appropriate personnel action against such an employee, up

    (g) Making a good faith effort to continue to maintain a drug-free 
workplace through implementation of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) 
and (f).
    B. The grantee may insert in the space provided below the site(s) 
for the performance of work done in connection with the specific grant:
Place of Performance (Street address, city, county, state, zip code)
 _______________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________

Check {time}  if there are workplaces on file that are not identified 
here.

              Alternate II. (Grantees Who Are Individuals)

    (a) The grantee certifies that, as a condition of the grant, he or 
she will not engage in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, 
dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance in conducting 
any activity with the grant;
    (b) If convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a 
violation occurring during the conduct of any grant activity, he or she 
will report the conviction, in writing, within 10 calendar days of the 
conviction, to every grant officer or other designee, unless the Federal 
agency designates a central point for the receipt of such notices. When 
notice is made to such a central point, it shall include the 
identification number(s) of each affected grant.

<R05>
Sec. 1157.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Accrued expenditures mean the charges incurred by the grantee during 
a given period requiring the provision of funds for: (1) Goods and other 
tangible property received; (2) services performed by employees, 
contractors, subgrantees, subcontractors, and other payees; and (3) 
other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current services 
or performance is required, such as annuities, insurance claims, and 
other benefit payments.
    Accrued income means the sum of: (1) Earnings during a given period 
from services performed by the grantee and goods and other tangible 
property delivered to purchasers, and (2) amounts becoming owed to the 
grantee for which no current services or performance is required by the 
grantee.
    Acquisition cost of an item of purchased equipment means the net 
invoice unit price of the property including the cost of modifications, 
attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the 
property usable for the purpose for which it was acquired. Other charges 
such as the cost of installation, transportation, taxes, duty or 
protective in-transit insurance, shall be included or excluded from the 
unit acquisition cost in accordance with the grantee's regular 
accounting practices.
    Administrative requirements mean those matters common to grants in 
general, such as financial management, kinds and frequency of reports, 
and retention of records. These are distinguished from programmatic 
requirements, which concern matters that can

[[Page 388]]

be treated only on a program-by-program or grant-by-grant basis, such as 
kinds of activities that can be supported by grants under a particular 
program.
    Awarding agency means (1) with respect to a grant, the Federal 
agency, and (2) with respect to a subgrant, the party that awarded the 
subgrant.
    Cash contributions means the grantee's cash outlay, including the 
outlay of money contributed to the grantee or subgrantee by other public 
agencies and institutions, and private organizations and individuals. 
When authorized by Federal legislation, Federal funds received from 
other assistance agreements may be considered as grantee or subgrantee 
cash contributions.
    Contract means (except as used in the definitions for grant and 
subgrant in this section and except where qualified by Federal) a 
procurement contract under a grant or subgrant, and means a procurement 
subcontract under a contract.
    Cost sharing or matching means the value of the third party in-kind 
contributions and the portion of the costs of a federally assisted 
project or program not borne by the Federal Government.
    Cost-type contract means a contract or subcontract under a grant in 
which the contractor or subcontractor is paid on the basis of the costs 
it incurs, with or without a fee.
    Equipment means tangible, nonexpendable, personal property having a 
useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or 
more per unit. A grantee may use its own definition of equipment 
provided that such definition would at least include all equipment 
defined above.
    Expenditure report means: (1) For nonconstruction grants, the SF-269 
Financial Status Report (or other equivalent report); (2) for 
construction grants, the SF-271 Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement (or other equivalent report).
    Federally recognized Indian tribal government means the governing 
body or a governmental agency of any Indian tribe, band, nation, or 
other organized group or community (including any Native village as 
defined in section 3 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, 85 Stat 
688) certified by the Secretary of the Interior as eligible for the 
special programs and services provided by him through the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs.
    Government means a State or local government or a federally 
recognized Indian tribal government.
    Grant means an award of financial assistance, including cooperative

Federal Government to an eligible grantee. The term does not include 
technical assistance which provides services instead of money, or other 
assistance in the form of revenue sharing, loans, loan guarantees, 
interest subsidies, insurance, or direct appropriations. Also, the term 
does not include assistance, such as a fellowship or other lump sum 
award, which the grantee is not required to account for.
    Grantee means the government to which a grant is awarded and which 
is accountable for the use of the funds provided. The grantee is the 
entire legal entity even if only a particular component of the entity is 
designated in the grant award document.
    Local government means a county, municipality, city, town, township, 
local public authority (including any public and Indian housing agency 
under the United States Housing Act of 1937) school district, special 
district, intrastate district, council of governments (whether or not 
incorporated as a nonprofit corporation under state law), any other 
regional or interstate government entity, or any agency or 
instrumentality of a local government.
    Obligations means the amounts of orders placed, contracts and 
subgrants awarded, goods and services received, and similar transactions 
during a given period that will require payment by the grantee during 
the same or a future period.
    OMB means the United States Office of Management and Budget.
    Outlays (expenditures) mean charges made to the project or program. 
They may be reported on a cash or accrual basis. For reports prepared on 
a cash basis, outlays are the sum of actual cash disbursement for direct 
charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense incurred, 
the value of

[[Page 389]]

in-kind contributions applied, and the amount of cash advances and 
payments made to contractors and subgrantees. For reports prepared on an 
accrued expenditure basis, outlays are the sum of actual cash 
disbursements, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value of 
inkind contributions applied, and the new increase (or decrease) in the 
amounts owed by the grantee for goods and other property received, for 
services performed by employees, contractors, subgrantees, 
subcontractors, and other payees, and other amounts becoming owed under 
programs for which no current services or performance are required, such 
as annuities, insurance claims, and other benefit payments.
    Percentage of completion method refers to a system under which 
payments are made for construction work according to the percentage of 
completion of the work, rather than to the grantee's cost incurred.
    Prior approval means documentation evidencing consent prior to 
incurring specific cost.
    Real property means land, including land improvements, structures 
and appurtenances thereto, excluding movable machinery and equipment.
    Share, when referring to the awarding agency's portion of real 
property, equipment or supplies, means the same percentage as the 
awarding agency's portion of the acquiring party's total costs under the 
grant to which the acquisition costs under the grant to which the 
acquisition cost of the property was charged. Only costs are to be 
counted--not the value of third-party in-kind contributions.
    State means any of the several States of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or 
possession of the United States, or any agency or instrumentality of a 
State exclusive of local governments. The term does not include any 
public and Indian housing agency under United States Housing Act of 
1937.
    Subgrant means an award of financial assistance in the form of 
money, or property in lieu of money, made under a grant by a grantee to 
an eligible subgrantee. The term includes financial assistance when 
provided by contractual legal agreement, but does not include 
procurement purchases, nor does it include any form of assistance which 
is excluded from the definition of grant in this part.
    Subgrantee means the government or other legal entity to which a 
subgrant is awarded and which is accountable to the grantee for the use 
of the funds provided.
    Supplies means all tangible personal property other than equipment 
as defined in this part.
    Suspension means depending on the context, either (1) temporary 
withdrawal of the authority to obligate grant funds pending corrective 
action by the grantee or subgrantee or a decision to terminate the 
grant, or (2) an action taken by a suspending official in accordance 
with agency regulations implementing E.O. 12549 to immediately exclude a 
person from participating in grant transactions for a period, pending 
completion of an investigation and such legal or debarment proceedings 
as may ensue.
    Termination means permanent withdrawal of the authority to obligate 
previously-awarded grant funds before that authority would otherwise 
expire. It also means the voluntary relinquishment of that authority by 
the grantee or subgrantee. Termination does not include: (1) Withdrawal 
of funds awarded on the basis of the grantee's underestimate of the 
unobligated balance in a prior period; (2) withdrawal of the unobligated 
balance as of the expiration of a grant; (3) refusal to extend a grant 
or award additional funds, to make a competing or noncompeting 
continuation, renewal, extension, or supplemental award; or (4) voiding 
of a grant upon determination that the award was obtained fraudulently, 
or was otherwise illegal or invalid from inception.
    Terms of a grant or subgrant mean all requirements of the grant or 
subgrant, whether in statute, regulations, or the award document.
    Third party in-kind contributions mean property or services which 
benefit a federally assisted project or program and which are 
contributed by non-Federal third parties without charge to the grantee, 
or a cost-type contractor under the grant agreement.
    Unliquidated obligations for reports prepared on a cash basis mean 
the

[[Page 390]]

amount of obligations incurred by the grantee that has not been paid. 
For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, they represent the 
amount of obligations incurred by the grantee for which an outlay has 
not been recorded.
    Unobligated balance means the portion of the funds authorized by the 
Federal agency that has not been obligated by the grantee and is 
determined by deducting the cumulative obligations from the cumulative 
funds authorized.

<R04>
                    Subpart B--Pre-Award Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 1157.10  Forms for applying for grants.

    (a) Scope. (1) This section prescribes forms and instructions to be 
used by governmental organizations (except hospitals and institutions of 
higher education operated by a government) in applying for grants. This 
section is not applicable, however, to formula grant programs which do 
not require applicants to apply for funds on a project basis.
    (2) This section applies only to applications to Federal agencies 
for grants, and is not required to be applied by grantees in dealing 
with applicants for subgrants. However, grantees are encouraged to avoid 
more detailed or burdensome application requirements for subgrants.
    (b) Authorized forms and instructions for governmental 
organizations. (1) In applying for grants, applicants shall only use 
standard application forms or those prescribed by the granting agency 
with the approval of OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
    (2) Applicants are not required to submit more than the original and 
two copies of preapplications or applications.
    (3) Applicants must follow all applicable instructions that bear OMB 
clearance numbers. Federal agencies may specify and describe the 
programs, functions, or activities that will be used to plan, budget, 
and evaluate the work under a grant. Other supplementary instructions 
may be issued only with the approval of OMB to the extent required under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. For any standard form, except the 
SF-424 facesheet, Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the 
applicant to disregard any line item that is not needed.
    (4) When a grantee applies for additional funding (such as a 
continuation or supplemental award) or amends a previously submitted 
application, only the affected pages need be submitted. Previously 
submitted pages with information that is still current need not be 
resubmitted.


<R05>
Sec. 1157.11  State plans.

    (a) Scope. The statutes for some programs require States to submit 
plans before receiving grants. Under regulations implementing Executive 
Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' States 
are allowed to simplify, consolidate and substitute plans. This section 
contains additional provisions for plans that are subject to regulations 
implementing the Executive order.
    (b) Requirements. A State need meet only Federal administrative or 
programmatic requirements for a plan that are in statutes or codified 
regulations.
    (c) Assurances. In each plan the State will include an assurance 
that the State shall comply with all applicable Federal statutes and 
regulations in effect with respect to the periods for which it receives 
grant funding. For this assurance and other assurances required in the 
plan, the State may:

[[Page 392]]

    (1) Cite by number the statutory or regulatory provisions requiring 
the assurances and affirm that it gives the assurances required by those 
provisions,
    (2) Repeat the assurance language in the statutes or regulations, or
    (3) Develop its own language to the extent permitted by law.
    (d) Amendments. A State will amend a plan whenever necessary to 
reflect: (1) New or revised Federal statutes or regulations or (2) a 
material change in any State law, organization, policy, or State agency 
operation. The State will obtain approval for the amendment and its 
effective date but need submit for approval only the amended portions of 
the plan.


<R05>
Sec. 1157.12  Special grant or subgrant conditions for ``high-risk'' grantees.

    (a) A grantee or subgrantee may be considered ``high risk'' if an 
awarding agency determines that a grantee or subgrantee:
    (1) Has a history of unsatisfactory performance, or
    (2) Is not financially stable, or
    (3) Has a management system which does not meet the management 
standards set forth in this part, or
    (4) Has not conformed to terms and conditions of previous awards, or
    (5) Is otherwise not responsible; and if the awarding agency 
determines that an award will be made, special conditions and/or 
restrictions shall correspond to the high risk condition and shall be 
included in the award.
    (b) Special conditions or restrictions may include:
    (1) Payment on a reimbursement basis;
    (2) Withholding authority to proceed to the next phase until receipt 
of evidence of acceptable performance within a given funding period;
    (3) Requiring additional, more detailed financial reports;
    (4) Additional project monitoring;
    (5) Requiring the grante or subgrantee to obtain technical or 
management assistance; or
    (6) Establishing additional prior approvals.
    (c) If an awarding agency decides to impose such conditions, the 
awarding official will notify the grantee or subgrantee as early as 
possible, in writing, of:
    (1) The nature of the special conditions/restrictions;
    (2) The reason(s) for imposing them;
    (3) The corrective actions which must be taken before they will be 
removed and the time allowed for completing the corrective actions and
    (4) The method of requesting reconsideration of the conditions/
restrictions imposed.


<R04>
                   Subpart C--Post-Award Requirements

                        Financial Administration


<R05>
Sec. 1157.20  Standards for financial management systems.

    (a) A State must expand and account for grant funds in accordance 
with State laws and procedures for expending and accounting for its own 
funds. Fiscal control and accounting procedures of the State, as well as 
its subgrantees and cost-type contractors, must be sufficient to--
    (1) Permit preparation of reports required by this part and the 
statutes authorizing the grant, and
    (2) Permit the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate 
to establish that such funds have not been used in violation of the 
restrictions and prohibitions of applicable statutes.
    (b) The financial management systems of other grantees and 
subgrantees must meet the following standards:
    (1) Financial reporting. Accurate, current, and complete disclosure 
of the financial results of financially assisted activities must be made 
in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the grant or 
subgrant.
    (2) Accounting records. Grantees and subgrantees must maintain 
records which adequately identify the source and application of funds 
provided for financially-assisted activities. These records must contain 
information pertaining to grant or subgrant awards and authorizations, 
obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays or 
expenditures, and income.
    (3) Internal control. Effective control and accountability must be 
maintained for all grant and subgrant cash, real

[[Page 393]]

and personal property, and other assets. Grantees and subgrantees must 
adequately safeguard all such property and must assure that it is used 
solely for authorized purposes.
    (4) Budget control. Actual expenditures or outlays must be compared 
with budgeted amounts for each grant or subgrant. Financial information 
must be related to performance or productivity data, including the 
development of unit cost information whenever appropriate or 
specifically required in the grant or subgrant agreement. If unit cost 
data are required, estimates based on available documentation will be 
accepted whenever possible.
    (5) Allowable cost. Applicable OMB cost principles, agency program 
regulations, and the terms of grant and subgrant agreements will be 
followed in determining the reasonableness, allowability, and 
allocability of costs.
    (6) Source documentation. Accounting records must be supported by 
such source documentation as cancelled checks, paid bills, payrolls, 
time and attendance records, contract and subgrant award documents, etc.
    (7) Cash management. Procedures for minimizing the time elapsing 
between the transfer of funds from the U.S. Treasury and disbursement by 
grantees and subgrantees must be followed whenever advance payment 
procedures are used. Grantees must establish reasonable procedures to 
ensure the receipt of reports on subgrantees' cash balances and cash 
disbursements in sufficient time to enable them to prepare complete and 
accurate cash transactions reports to the awarding agency. When advances 
are made by letter-of-credit or electronic transfer of funds methods, 
the grantee must make drawdowns as close as possible to the time of 
making disbursements. Grantees must monitor cash drawdowns by their 
subgrantees to assure that they conform substantially to the same 
standards of timing and amount as apply to advances to the grantees.
    (c) An awarding agency may review the adequacy of the financial 
management system of any applicant for financial assistance as part of a 
preaward review or at any time subsequent to award.


<R05>
Sec. 1157.21  Payment.

    (a) Scope. This section prescribes the basic standard and the 
methods under which a Federal agency will make payments to grantees, and 
grantees will make payments to subgrantees and contractors.
    (b) Basic standard. Methods and procedures for payment shall 
minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and 
disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee, in accordance with Treasury 
regulations at 31 CFR part 205.
    (c) Advances. Grantees and subgrantees shall be paid in advance, 
provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness and ability to 
maintain procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer 
of the funds and their disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee.
    (d) Reimbursement. Reimbursement shall be the preferred method when 
the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section are not met. Grantees 
and subgrantees may also be paid by reimbursement for any construction 
grant. Except as otherwise specified in regulation, Federal agencies 
shall not use the percentage of completion method to pay construction 
grants. The grantee or subgrantee may use that method to pay its 
construction contractor, and if it does, the awarding agency's payments 
to the grantee or subgrantee will be based on the grantee's or 
subgrantee's actual rate of disbursement.
    (e) Working capital advances. If a grantee cannot meet the criteria 
for advance payments described in paragraph (c) of this section, and the 
Federal agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because 
the grantee lacks sufficient working capital, the awarding agency may 
provide cash or a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure 
the awarding agency shall advance cash to the grantee to cover its 
estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to 
the grantee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the awarding agency shall 
reimburse the grantee for its actual cash disbursements. The working 
capital advance method of payment shall not be used by grantees or 
subgrantees if the reason for using

[[Page 394]]

such method is the unwillingness or inability of the grantee to provide 
timely advances to the subgrantee to meet the subgrantee's actual cash 
disbursements.
    (f) Effect of program income, refunds, and audit recoveries on 
payment. (1) Grantees and subgrantees shall disburse repayments to and 
interest earned on a revolving fund before requesting additional cash 
payments for the same activity.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, grantees 
and subgrantees shall disburse program income, rebates, refunds, 
contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds 
before requesting additional cash payments.
    (g) Withholding payments. (1) Unless otherwise required by Federal 
statute, awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper 
charges incurred by grantees or subgrantees unless--
    (i) The grantee or subgrantee has failed to comply with grant award 
conditions or
    (ii) The grantee or subgrantee is indebted to the United States.
    (2) Cash withheld for failure to comply with grant award condition, 
but without suspension of the grant, shall be released to the grantee 
upon subsequent compliance. When a grant is suspended, payment 
adjustments will be made in accordance with Sec. 1157.43(c).
    (3) A Federal agency shall not make payment to grantees for amounts 
that are withheld by grantees or subgrantees from payment to contractors 
to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payments shall be made by the 
Federal agency when the grantees or subgrantees actually disburse the 
withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to 
assure satisfactory completion of work.
    (h) Cash depositories. (1) Consistent with the national goal of 
expanding the opportunities for minority business enterprises, grantees 
and subgrantees are encouraged to use minority banks (a bank which is 
owned at least 50 percent by minority group members). A list of minority 
owned banks can be obtained from the Minority Business Development 
Agency, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230.
    (2) A grantee or subgrantee shall maintain a separate bank account 
only when required by Federal-State agreement.
    (i) Interest earned on advances. Except for interest earned on 
advances of funds exempt under the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 
U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) and the Indian Self-Determination Act (23 U.S.C. 
450), grantees and subgrantees shall promptly, but at least quarterly, 
remit interest earned on advances to the Federal agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee may keep interest amounts up to $100 per year for 
administrative expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 1157.22  Allowable costs.

    (a) Limitation on use of funds. Grant funds may be used only for:
    (1) The allowable costs of the grantees, subgrantees and cost-type 
contractors, including allowable costs in the form of payments to fixed-
price contractors; and
    (2) Reasonable fees or profit to cost-type contractors but not any 
fee or profit (or other increment above allowable costs) to the grantee 
or subgrantee.
    (b) Applicable cost principles. For each kind of organization, there 
is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. 
Allowable costs will be determined in accordance with the cost 
principles applicable to the organization incurring the costs. The 
following chart lists the kinds of organizations and the applicable cost 
principles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


[[Page 395]]


<R05>
Sec. 1157.23  Period of availability of funds.

    (a) General. Where a funding period is specified, a grantee may 
charge to the award only costs resulting from obligations of the funding 
period unless carryover of unobligated balances is permitted, in which 
case the carryover balances may be charged for costs resulting from 
obligations of the subsequent funding period.
    (b) Liquidation of obligations. A grantee must liquidate all 
obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 days after the 
end of the funding period (or as specified in a program regulation) to 
coincide with the submission of the annual Financial Status Report (SF-
269). The Federal agency may extend this deadline at the request of the 
grantee.


<R05>
Sec. 1157.24  Matching or cost sharing.

    (a) Basic rule: Costs and contributions acceptable. With the 
qualifications and exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, a 
matching or cost sharing requirement may be satisfied by either or both 
of the following:
    (1) Allowable costs incurred by the grantee, subgrantee or a cost-
type contractor under the assistance agreement. This includes allowable 
costs borne by non-Federal grants or by others cash donations from non-
Federal third parties.
    (2) The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to the 
period to which the cost sharing or matching requirements applies.
    (b) Qualifications and exceptions--(1) Costs borne by other Federal 
grant agreements. Except as provided by Federal statute, a cost sharing 
or matching requirement may not be met by costs borne by another Federal 
grant. This prohibition does not apply to income earned by a grantee or 
subgrantee from a contract awarded under another Federal grant.
    (2) General revenue sharing. For the purpose of this section, 
general revenue sharing funds distributed under 31 U.S.C. 6702 are not 
considered Federal grant funds.
    (3) Cost or contributions counted towards other Federal costs-
sharing requirements. Neither costs nor the values of third party in-
kind contributions may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or 
matching requirement of a grant agreement if they have been or will be 
counted towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of 
another Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement contract, or any 
other award of Federal funds.
    (4) Costs financed by program income. Costs financed by program 
income, as defined in Sec. 1157.25, shall not count towards satisfying a 
cost sharing or matching requirement unless they are expressly permitted 
in the terms of the assistance agreement. (This use of general program 
income is described in Sec. 1157.25(g).)
    (5) Services or property financed by income earned by contractors. 
Contractors under a grant may earn income from the activities carried 
out under the contract in addition to the amounts earned from the party 
awarding the contract. No costs of services or property supported by 
this income may count toward satisfying a cost sharing or matching 
requirement unless other provisions of the grant agreement expressly 
permit this kind of income to be used to meet the requirement.
    (6) Records. Costs and third party in-kind contributions counting 
towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement must be 
verifiable from the records of grantees and subgrantee or cost-type 
contractors. These records must show how the value placed on third party 
in-kind contributions was derived. To the extent feasible, volunteer 
services will be supported by the same methods that the organization 
uses to support the allocability of regular personnel costs.
    (7) Special standards for third party in-kind contributions. (i) 
Third party in-kind contributions count towards satisfying a cost 
sharing or matching requirement only where, if the party receiving the 
contributions were to pay for them, the payments would be allowable 
costs.
    (ii) Some third party in-kind contributions are goods and services 
that, if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor receiving the 
contribution had to pay for them, the payments would have been an 
indirect costs. Costs sharing or matching credit for such contributions

[[Page 396]]

shall be given only if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor has 
established, along with its regular indirect cost rate, a special rate 
for allocating to individual projects or programs the value of the 
contributions.
    (iii) A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed-price contract 
may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only 
if it results in:
    (A) An increase in the services or property provided under the 
contract (without additional cost to the grantee or subgrantee) or
    (B) A cost savings to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (iv) The values placed on third party in-kind contributions for cost 
sharing or matching purposes will conform to the rules in the succeeding 
sections of this part. If a third party in-kind contribution is a type 
not treated in those sections, the value placed upon it shall be fair 
and reasonable.
    (c) Valuation of donated services--(1) Volunteer services. Unpaid 
services provided to a grantee or subgrantee by individuals will be 
valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work 
in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. If the grantee or 
subgrantee does not have employees performing similar work, the rates 
will be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for 
similar work in the same labor market. In either case, a reasonable 
amount for fringe benefits may be included in the valuation.
    (2) Employees of other organizations. When an employer other than a 
grantee, subgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge 
the services of an employee in the employee's normal line of work, the 
services will be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive 
of the employee's fringe benefits and overhead costs. If the services 
are in a different line of work, paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
applies.
    (d) Valuation of third party donated supplies and loaned equipment 
or space. (1) If a third party donates supplies, the contribution will 
be valued at the market value of the supplies at the time of donation.
    (2) If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a 
building but retains title, the contribution will be valued at the fair 
rental rate of the equipment or space.
    (e) Valuation of third party donated equipment, buildings, and land. 
If a third party donates equipment, buildings, or land, and title passes 
to a grantee or subgrantee, the treatment of the donated property will 
depend upon the purpose of the grant or subgrant, as follows:
    (1) Awards for capital expenditures. If the purpose of the grant or 
subgrant is to assist the grantee or subgrantee in the acquisition of 
property, the market value of that property at the time of donation may 
be counted as cost sharing or matching,
    (2) Other awards. If assisting in the acquisition of property is not 
the purpose of the grant or subgrant, paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of 
this section apply:
    (i) If approval is obtained from the awarding agency, the market 
value at the time of donation of the donated equipment or buildings and 
the fair rental rate of the donated land may be counted as cost sharing 
or matching. In the case of a subgrant, the terms of the grant agreement 
may require that the approval be obtained from the Federal agency as 
well as the grantee. In all cases, the approval may be given only if a 
purchase of the equipment or rental of the land would be approved as an 
allowable direct cost. If any part of the donated property was acquired 
with Federal funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be 
counted as cost-sharing or matching.
    (ii) If approval is not obtained under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this 
section, no amount may be counted for donated land, and only 
depreciation or use allowances may be counted for donated equipment and 
buildings. The depreciation or use allowances for this property are not 
treated as third party in-kind contributions. Instead, they are treated 
as costs incurred by the grantee or subgrantee. They are computed and 
allocated (usually as indirect costs) in accordance with the cost 
principles specified in Sec. 1157.22, in the same way as depreciation or 
use allowances for purchased equipment and buildings. The

[[Page 397]]

amount of depreciation or use allowances for donated equipment and 
buildings is based on the property's market value at the time it was 
donated.
    (f) Valuation of grantee or subgrantee donated real property for 
construction/acquisition. If a grantee or subgrantee donates real 
property for a construction or facilities acquisition project, the 
current market value of that property may be counted as cost sharing or 
matching. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal 
funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be counted as cost 
sharing or matching.
    (g) Appraisal of real property. In some cases under paragraphs (d), 
(e) and (f) of this section, it will be necessary to establish the 
market value of land or a building or the fair rental rate of land or of 
space in a building. In these cases, the Federal agency may require the 
market value or fair rental value be set by an independent appraiser, 
and that the value or rate be certified by the grantee. This requirement 
will also be imposed by the grantee on subgrantees.


<R05>
Sec. 1157.25  Program income.

    (a) General. Grantees are encouraged to earn income to defray 
program costs. Program income includes income from fees for services 
performed, from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired 
with grant funds, from the sale of commodities or items fabricated under 
a grant agreement, and from payments of principal and interest on loans 
made with grant funds. Except as otherwise provided in regulations of 
the Federal agency, program income does not include interest on grant 
funds, rebates, credits, discounts, refunds, etc. and interest earned on 
any of them.
    (b) Definition of program income. Program income means gross income 
received by the grantee or subgrantee directly generated by a grant 
supported activity, or earned only as a result of the grant agreement 
during the grant period. ``During the grant period'' is the time between 
the effective date of the award and the ending date of the award 
reflected in the final financial report.
    (c) Cost of generating program income. If authorized by Federal 
regulations or the grant agreement, costs incident to the generation of 
program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program 
income.
    (d) Governmental revenues. Taxes, special assessments, levies, 
fines, and other such revenues raised by a grantee or subgrantee are not 
program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the 
grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income.
    (e) Royalties. Income from royalties and license fees for 
copyrighted material, patents, and inventions developed by a grantee or 
subgrantee is program income only if the revenues are specifically 
identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as 
program income. (See Sec. 1157.34.)
    (f) Property. Proceeds from the sale of real property or equipment 
will be handled in accordance with the requirements of Secs. 1157.31 and 
1157.32.
    (g) Use of program income. Program income shall be deducted from 
outlays which may be both Federal and non-Federal as described below, 
unless the Federal agency regulations or the grant agreement specify 
another alternative (or a combination of the alternatives). In 
specifying alternatives, the Federal agency may distinguish between 
income earned by the grantee and income earned by subgrantees and 
between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income. When Federal agencies 
authorize the alternatives in paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) of this 
section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall also be 
deducted from outlays.
    (1) Deduction. Ordinarily program income shall be deducted from 
total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program 
income shall be used for current costs unless the Federal agency 
authorizes otherwise. Program income which the grantee did not 
anticipate at the time of the award shall be used to reduce the Federal 
agency and grantee contributions rather than to increase the funds 
committed to the project.
    (2) Addition. When authorized, program income may be added to the 
funds committed to the grant agreement by the Federal agency and the 
grantee. The program income shall be

[[Page 398]]

used for the purposes and under the conditions of the grant agreement.
    (3) Cost sharing or matching. When authorized, program income may be 
used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the grant 
agreement. The amount of the Federal grant award remains the same.
    (h) Income after the award period. There are no Federal requirements 
governing the disposition of program income earned after the end of the 
award period (i.e., until the ending date of the final financial report, 
see paragraph (a) of this section), unless the terms of the agreement or 
the Federal agency regulations provide otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 1157.26  Non-Federal audit.

    (a) Basic rule. Grantees and subgrantees are responsible for 
obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 
1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits of 
States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.'' The audits 
shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance with generally 
accepted government auditing standards covering financial audits.
    (b) Subgrantees. State or local governments, as those terms are 
defined for purposes of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, that 
provide Federal awards to a subgrantee, which expends $300,000 or more 
(or other amount as specified by OMB) in Federal awards in a fiscal 
year, shall:
    (1) Determine whether State or local subgrantees have met the audit 
requirements of the Act and whether subgrantees covered by OMB Circular 
A-110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements 
with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit 
Organizations,'' have met the audit requirements of the Act. Commercial 
contractors (private for-profit and private and governmental 
organizations) providing goods and services to State and local 
governments are not required to have a single audit performed. State and 
local governments should use their own procedures to ensure that the 
contractor has complied with laws and regulations affecting the 
expenditure of Federal funds;
    (2) Determine whether the subgrantee spent Federal assistance funds 
provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be 
accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subgrantee made in accordance 
with the Act, Circular A-110, or through other means (e.g., program 
reviews) if the subgrantee has not had such an audit;
    (3) Ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken within six 
months after receipt of the audit report in instance of noncompliance 
with Federal laws and regulations;
    (4) Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate adjustment of the 
grantee's own records; and
    (5) Require each subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have 
access to the records and financial statements.
    (c) Auditor selection. In arranging for audit services, Sec. 1157.36 
shall be followed.

                    Changes, Property, and Subawards


<R05>
Sec. 1157.30  Changes.

    (a) General. Grantees and subgrantees are permitted to rebudget 
within the approved direct cost budget to meet unanticipated 
requirements and may make limited program changes to the approved 
project. However, unless waived by the awarding agency, certain types of 
post-award changes in budgets and projects shall require the prior 
written approval of the awarding agency.
    (b) Relation to cost principles. The applicable cost principles (see 
Sec. 1157.22) contain requirements for prior approval of certain types 
of costs. Except where waived, those requirements apply to all grants 
and subgrants even if paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section do not.
    (c) Budget changes--(1) Nonconstruction projects. Except as stated 
in other regulations or an award document, grantees or subgrantees shall 
obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the 
following changes is anticipated under a nonconstruction award:
    (i) Any revision which would result in the need for additional 
funding.

[[Page 399]]

    (ii) Unless waived by the awarding agency, cumulative transfers 
among direct cost categories, or, if applicable, among separately 
budgeted programs, projects, functions, or activities which exceed or 
are expected to exceed ten percent of the current total approved budget, 
whenever the awarding agency's share exceeds $100,000.
    (iii) Transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (i.e., from 
direct payments to trainees to other expense categories).
    (2) Construction projects. Grantees and subgrantees shall obtain 
prior written approval for any budget revision which would result in the 
need for additional funds.
    (3) Combined construction and nonconstruction projects. When a grant 
or subgrant provides funding for both construction and nonconstruction 
activities, the grantee or subgrantee must obtain prior written approval 
from the awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfer from 
nonconstruction to construction or vice versa.
    (d) Programmatic changes. Grantees or subgrantees must obtain the 
prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following 
actions is anticipated:
    (1) Any revision of the scope or objectives of the project 
(regardless of whether there is an associated budget revision requiring 
prior approval).
    (2) Need to extend the period of availability of funds.
    (3) Changes in key persons in cases where specified in an 
application or a grant award. In research projects, a change in the 
project director or principal investigator shall always require approval 
unless waived by the awarding agency.
    (4) Under nonconstruction projects, contracting out, subgranting (if 
authorized by law) or otherwise obtaining the services of a third party 
to perform activities which are central to the purposes of the award. 
This approval requirement is in addition to the approval requirements of 
Sec. 1157.36 but does not apply to the procurement of equipment, 
supplies, and general support services.
    (e) Additional prior approval requirements. The awarding agency may 
not require prior approval for any budget revision which is not 
described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) Requesting prior approval. (1) A request for prior approval of 
any budget revision will be in the same budget formal the grantee used 
in its application and shall be accompanied by a narrative justification 
for the proposed revision.
    (2) A request for a prior approval under the applicable Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 1157.22) may be made by letter.
    (3) A request by a subgrantee for prior approval will be addressed 
in writing to the grantee. The grantee will promptly review such request 
and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing. A grantee will 
not approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent with 
the purpose or terms and conditions of the Federal grant to the grantee. 
If the revision, requested by the subgrantee would result in a change to 
the grantee's approved project which requires Federal prior approval, 
the grantee will obtain the Federal agency's approval before approving 
the subgrantee's request.


<R05>
Sec. 1157.31  Real property.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to real property acquired under a grant or subgrant 
will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Use. Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes, real 
property will be used for the originally authorized purposes as long as 
needed for that purposes, and the grantee or subgrantee shall not 
dispose of or encumber its title or other interests.
    (c) Disposition. When real property is no longer needed for the 
originally authorized purpose, the grantee or subgrantee will request 
disposition instructions from the awarding agency. The instructions will 
provide for one of the following alternatives:
    (1) Retention of title. Retain title after compensating the awarding 
agency. The amount paid to the awarding agency will be computed by 
applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost 
of the original purchase to the fair market value of

[[Page 400]]

the property. However, in those situations where a grantee or subgrantee 
is disposing of real property acquired with grant funds and acquiring 
replacement real property under the same program, the net proceeds from 
the disposition may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement 
property.
    (2) Sale of property. Sell the property and compensate the awarding 
agency. The amount due to the awarding agency will be calculated by 
applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost 
of the original purchase to the proceeds of the sale after deduction of 
any actual and reasonable selling and fixing-up expenses. If the grant 
is still active, the net proceeds from sale may be offset against the 
original cost of the property. When a grantee or subgrantee is directed 
to sell property, sales procedures shall be followed that provide for 
competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible 
return.
    (3) Transfer of title. Transfer title to the awarding agency or to a 
third-party designated/approved by the awarding agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the grantee or 
subgrantee's percentage of participation in the purchase of the real 
property to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 1157.32  Equipment.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) States. A State will use, manage, and dispose of equipment 
acquired under a grant by the State in accordance with State laws and 
procedures. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (c) 
through (e) of this section.
    (c) Use. (1) Equipment shall be used by the grantee or subgrantee in 
the program or project for which it was acquired as long as needed, 
whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by 
Federal funds. When no longer needed for the original program or 
project, the equipment may be used in other activities currently or 
previously supported by a Federal agency.
    (2) The grantee or subgrantee shall also make equipment available 
for use on other projects or programs currently or previously supported 
by the Federal Government, providing such use will not interfere with 
the work on the projects or program for which it was originally 
acquired. First preference for other use shall be given to other 
programs or projects supported by the awarding agency. User fees should 
be considered if appropriate.
    (3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in Sec. 1157.25(a) to earn 
program income, the grantee or subgrantee must not use equipment 
acquired with grant funds to provide services for a fee to compete 
unfairly with private companies that provide equivalent services, unless 
specifically permitted or contemplated by Federal statute.
    (4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the grantee or subgrantee 
may use the equipment to be replaced as a trade-in or sell the property 
and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement property, 
subject to the approval of the awarding agency.
    (d) Management requirements. Procedures for managing equipment 
(including replacement equipment), whether acquired in whole or in part 
with grant funds, until disposition takes place will, as a minimum, meet 
the following requirements:
    (1) Property records must be maintained that include a description 
of the property, a serial number or other identification number, the 
source of property, who holds title, the acquisition date, and cost of 
the property, percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the 
property, the location, use and condition of the property, and any 
ultimate disposition data including the date of disposal and sale price 
of the property.
    (2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken and the 
results reconciled with the property records at least once every two 
years.
    (3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards 
to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property. Any loss, damage, or 
theft shall be investigated.

[[Page 401]]

    (4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the 
property in good condition.
    (5) If the grantee or subgrantee is authorized or required to sell 
the property, proper sales procedures must be established to ensure the 
highest possible return.
    (e) Disposition. When original or replacement equipment acquired 
under a grant or subgrant is no longer needed for the original project 
or program or for other activities currently or previously supported by 
a Federal agency, disposition of the equipment will be made as follows:
    (1) Items of equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of 
less than $5,000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no 
further obligation to the awarding agency.
    (2) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value in 
excess of $5,000 may be retained or sold and the awarding agency shall 
have a right to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market 
value or proceeds from sale by the awarding agency's share of the 
equipment.
    (3) In cases where a grantee or subgrantee fails to take appropriate 
disposition actions, the awarding agency may direct the grantee or 
subgrantee to take excess and disposition actions.
    (f) Federal equipment. In the event a grantee or subgrantee is 
provided federally-owned equipment:
    (1) Title will remain vested in the Federal Government.
    (2) Grantees or subgrantees will manage the equipment in accordance 
with Federal agency rules and procedures, and submit an annual inventory 
listing.
    (3) When the equipment is no longer needed, the grantee or 
subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the Federal 
agency.
    (g) Right to transfer title. The Federal awarding agency may reserve 
the right to transfer title to the Federal Government or a third part 
named by the awarding agency when such a third party is otherwise 
eligible under existing statutes. Such transfers shall be subject to the 
following standards:
    (1) The property shall be identified in the grant or otherwise made 
known to the grantee in writing.
    (2) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instruction 
within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the 
project for which it was acquired. If the Federal awarding agency fails 
to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar-day period the 
grantee shall follow Sec. 1157.32(e).
    (3) When title to equipment is transferred, the grantee shall be 
paid an amount calculated by applying the percentage of participation in 
the purchase to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 1157.33  Supplies.

    (a) Title. Title to supplies acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest, upon acquisition, in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Disposition. If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies 
exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate fair market value upon termination 
or completion of the award, and if the supplies are not needed for any 
other federally sponsored programs or projects, the grantee or 
subgrantee shall compensate the awarding agency for its share.


<R05>
Sec. 1157.34  Copyrights.

    The Federal awarding agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, 
and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish or otherwise use, and to 
authorize others to use, for Federal Government purposes:
    (a) The copyright in any work developed under a grant, subgrant, or 
contract under a grant or subgrant; and
    (b) Any rights of copyright to which a grantee, subgrantee or a 
contractor purchases ownership with grant support.


<R05>
Sec. 1157.35  Subawards to debarred and suspended parties.

    Grantees and subgrantees must not make any award or permit any award 
(subgrant or contract) at any tier to any party which is debarred or 
suspended or is otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation 
in Federal assistance programs under Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment 
and Suspension.''

[[Page 402]]


<R05>
Sec. 1157.36  Procurement.

    (a) States. When procuring property and services under a grant, a 
State will follow the same policies and procedures it uses for 
procurements from its non-Federal funds. The State will ensure that 
every purchase order or other contract includes any clauses required by 
Federal statutes and executive orders and their implementing 
regulations. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (b) 
through (i) in this section.
    (b) Procurement standards. (1) Grantees and subgrantees will use 
their own procurement procedures which reflect applicable State and 
local laws and regulations, provided that the procurements conform to 
applicable Federal law and the standards identified in this section.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a contract administration 
system which ensures that contractors perform in accordance with the 
terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase 
orders.
    (3) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a written code of 
standards of conduct governing the performance of their employees 
engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, 
officer or agent of the grantee or subgrantee shall participate in 
selection, or in the award or administration of a contract supported by 
Federal funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be 
involved. Such a conflict would arise when:
    (i) The employee, officer or agent,
    (ii) Any member of his immediate family,
    (iii) His or her partner, or
    (iv) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of 
the above, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for 
award. The grantee's or subgrantee's officers, employees or agents will 
neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary 
value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to 
subagreements. Grantee and subgrantees may set minimum rules where the 
financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item 
of nominal intrinsic value. To the extent permitted by State or local 
law or regulations, such standards or conduct will provide for 
penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of 
such standards by the grantee's and subgrantee's officers, employees, or 
agents, or by contractors or their agents. The awarding agency may in 
regulation provide additional prohibitions relative to real, apparent, 
or potential conflicts of interest.
    (4) Grantee and subgrantee procedures will provide for a review of 
proposed procurements to avoid purchase of unnecessary or duplicative 
items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out 
procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an 
analysis will be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any 
other appropriate analysis to determine the most economical approach.
    (5) To foster greater economy and efficiency, grantees and 
subgrantees are encouraged to enter into State and local 
intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common goods and 
services.
    (6) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use Federal excess 
and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property 
whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs.
    (7) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use value engineering 
clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to 
offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is 
a systematic and creative anaylsis of each contract item or task to 
ensure that its essential function is provided at the overall lower 
cost.
    (8) Grantees and subgrantees will make awards only to responsible 
contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the 
terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be 
given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public 
policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical 
resources.
    (9) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain records sufficient to 
detail the significant history of a procurement. These records will 
include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: rationale for 
the method of

[[Page 403]]

procurement, selection of contract type, contractor selection or 
rejection, and the basis for the contract price.
    (10) Grantees and subgrantees will use time and material type 
contracts only--
    (i) After a determination that no other contract is suitable, and
    (ii) If the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor 
exceeds at its own risk.
    (11) Grantees and subgrantees alone will be responsible, in 
accordance with good administrative practice and sound business 
judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative 
issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not 
limited to source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. These 
standards do not relieve the grantee or subgrantee of any contractual 
responsibilities under its contracts. Federal agencies will not 
substitute their judgment for that of the grantee or subgrantee unless 
the matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be 
referred to the local, State, or Federal authority having proper 
jurisdiction.
    (12) Grantees and subgrantees will have protest procedures to handle 
and resolve disputes relating to their procurements and shall in all 
instances disclose information regarding the protest to the awarding 
agency. A protestor must exhaust all administrative remedies with the 
grantee and subgrantee before pursuing a protest with the Federal 
agency. Reviews of protests by the Federal agency will be limited to:
    (i) Violations of Federal law or regulations and the standards of 
this section (violations of State or local law will be under the 
jurisdiction of State or local authorities) and
    (ii) Violations of the grantee's or subgrantee's protest procedures 
for failure to review a complaint or protest. Protests received by the 
Federal agency other than those specified above will be referred to the 
grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Competition. (1) All procurement transactions will be conducted 
in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with the 
standards of Sec. 1157.36. Some of the situations considered to be 
restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:
    (i) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to 
qualify to do business,
    (ii) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding,
    (iii) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between 
affiliated companies,
    (iv) Noncompetitive awards to consultants that are on retainer 
contracts,
    (v) Organizational conflicts of interest,
    (vi) Specifying only a ``brand name'' product instead of allowing 
``an equal'' product to be offered and describing the performance of 
other relevant requirements of the procurement, and
    (vii) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will conduct procurements in a manner 
that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-
State or local geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or 
proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes 
expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing in this 
section preempts State licensing laws. When contracting for 
architectural and engineering (A/E) services, geographic location may be 
a selection criteria provided its application leaves an appropriate 
number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to 
compete for the contract.
    (3) Grantees will have written selection procedures for procurement 
transactions. These procedures will ensure that all solicitations:
    (i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical 
requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such 
description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features 
which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a 
statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service 
to be procured, and when necessary, shall set forth those minimum 
essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it 
is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should 
be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to 
make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a 
``brand name

[[Page 404]]

or equal'' description may be used as a means to define the performance 
or other salient requirements of a procurement. The specific features of 
the named brand which must be met by offerors shall be clearly stated; 
and
    (ii) Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and 
all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.
    (4) Grantees and subgrantees will ensure that all prequalified lists 
of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and 
services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure 
maximum open and free competition. Also, grantees and subgrantees will 
not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation 
period.
    (d) Methods of procurement to be followed--(1) Procurement by small 
purchase procedures. Small purchase procedures are those relatively 
simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, 
or other property that do not cost more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently set at $100,000). If 
small purchase procedures are used, price or rate quotations shall be 
obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.
    (2) Procurement by sealed bids (formal advertising). Bids are 
publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit 
price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with 
all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the 
lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for 
procuring construction, if the conditions in Sec. 1157.36(d)(2)(i) 
apply.
    (i) In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following 
conditions should be present:
    (A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase 
description is available;
    (B) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete 
effectively and for the business; and
    (C) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and 
the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the 
basis of price.
    (ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:
    (A) The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids 
shall be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing 
them sufficient time prior to the date set for opening the bids;
    (B) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications 
and pertinent attachments, shall define the items or services in order 
for the bidder to properly respond;
    (C) All bids will be publicly opened at the time and place 
prescribed in the invitation for bids;
    (D) A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing to the 
lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding 
documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life 
cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is lowest. 
Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior 
experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; 
and
    (E) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented 
reason.
    (3) Procurement by competitive proposals. The technique of 
competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source 
submitting an offer, and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type 
contract is awarded. It is generally used when conditions are not 
appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the 
following requirements apply:
    (i) Requests for proposals will be publicized and identify all 
evaluation factors and their relative importance. Any response to 
publicized requests for proposals shall be honored to the maximum extent 
practical;
    (ii) Proposals will be solicited from an adequate number of 
qualified sources;
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees will have a method for conducting 
technical evaluations of the proposals received and for selecting 
awardees;
    (iv) Awards will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is 
most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors 
considered; and
    (v) Grantees and subgrantees may use competitive proposal procedures 
for qualifications-based procurement of

[[Page 405]]

architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services whereby 
competitors' qualifications are evaluated and the most qualified 
competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of fair and reasonable 
compensation. The method, where price is not used as a selection factor, 
can only be used in procurement of A/E professional services. It cannot 
be used to purchase other types of services though A/E firms are a 
potential source to perform the proposed effort.
    (4) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals is procurement through 
solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or after solicitation 
of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.
    (i) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used only when 
the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase procedures, 
sealed bids or competitive proposals and one of the following 
circumstances applies:
    (A) The item is available only from a single source;
    (B) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not 
permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation;
    (C) The awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive proposals; or
    (D) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is 
determined inadequate.
    (ii) Cost analysis, i.e., verifying the proposed cost data, the 
projections of the data, and the evaluation of the specific elements of 
costs and profits, is required.
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees may be required to submit the 
proposed procurement to the awarding agency for pre-award review in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (e) Contracting with small and minority firms, women's business 
enterprise and labor surplus area firms. (1) The grantee and subgrantee 
will take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority firms, 
women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when 
possible.
    (2) Affirmative steps shall include:
    (i) Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women's 
business enterprises on solicitation lists;
    (ii) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women's 
business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources;
    (iii) Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into 
smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small and 
minority business, and women's business enterprises;
    (iv) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, 
which encourage participation by small and minority business, and 
women's business enterprises;
    (v) Using the services and assistance of the Small Business 
Administration, and the Minority Business Development Agency of the 
Department of Commerce; and
    (vi) Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, 
to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through 
(v) of this section.
    (f) Contract cost and price. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must 
perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement 
action including contract modifications. The method and degree of 
analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular 
procurement situation, but as a starting point, grantees must make 
independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. A cost 
analysis must be performed when the offeror is required to submit the 
elements of his estimated cost, e.g., under professional, consulting, 
and architectural engineering services contracts. A cost analysis will 
be necessary when adequate price competition is lacking, and for sole 
source procurements, including contract modifications or change orders, 
unless price resonableness can be established on the basis of a catalog 
or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities 
to the general public or based on prices set by law or regulation. A 
price analysis will be used in all other instances to determine the 
reasonableness of the proposed contract price.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will negotiate profit as a separate 
element of the price for each contract in which there is no price 
competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed.

[[Page 406]]

To establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration will be given 
to the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the 
contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, 
the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates 
in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.
    (3) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under 
grants will be allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost 
estimates included in negotiated prices are consistent with Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 1157.22). Grantees may reference their own cost 
principles that comply with the applicable Federal cost principles.
    (4) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of 
construction cost methods of contracting shall not be used.
    (g) Awarding agency review. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must make 
available, upon request of the awarding agency, technical specifications 
on proposed procurements where the awarding agency believes such review 
is needed to ensure that the item and/or service specified is the one 
being proposed for purchase. This review generally will take place prior 
to the time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation 
document. However, if the grantee or subgrantee desires to have the 
review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the 
awarding agency may still review the specifications, with such review 
usually limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees must on request make available for 
awarding agency pre-award review procurement documents, such as requests 
for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc. 
when:
    (i) A grantee's or subgrantee's procurement procedures or operation 
fails to comply with the procurement standards in this section; or
    (ii) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold and is to be awarded without competition or only 
one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation; or
    (iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product; or
    (iv) The proposed award is more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold and is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder 
under a sealed bid procurement; or
    (v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract 
or increases the contract amount by more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold.
    (3) A grantee or subgrantee will be exempt from the pre-award review 
in paragraph (g)(2) of this section if the awarding agency determines 
that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this section.
    (i) A grantee or subgrantee may request that its procurement system 
be reviewed by the awarding agency to determine whether its system meets 
these standards in order for its system to be certified. Generally, 
these reviews shall occur where there is a continuous high-dollar 
funding, and third-party contracts are awarded on a regular basis.
    (ii) A grantee or subgrantee may self-certify its procurement 
system. Such self-certification shall not limit the awarding agency's 
right to survey the system. Under a self-certification procedure, 
awarding agencies may wish to rely on written assurances from the 
grantee or subgrantee that it is complying with these standards. A 
grantee or subgrantee will cite specific procedures, regulations, 
standards, etc., as being in compliance with these requirements and have 
its system available for review.
    (h) Bonding requirements. For construction or facility improvement 
contracts or subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition 
threshold, the awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and 
requirements of the grantee or subgrantee provided the awarding agency 
has made a determination that the awarding agency's interest is 
adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the 
minimum requirements shall be as follows:
    (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of 
the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist of a firm commitment 
such as a bid bond,

[[Page 407]]

certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as 
assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such 
contractual documents as may be required within the time specified.
    (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent 
of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is one executed in 
connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's 
obligations under such contract.
    (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of 
the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed in connection 
with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons 
supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for 
in the contract.
    (i) Contract provisions. A grantee's and subgrantee's contracts must 
contain provisions in paragraph (i) of this section. Federal agencies 
are permitted to require changes, remedies, changed conditions, access 
and records retention, suspension of work, and other clauses approved by 
the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.
    (1) Administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances 
where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such 
sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate. (Contracts more than the 
simplified acquisition threshold)
    (2) Termination for cause and for convenience by the grantee or 
subgrantee including the manner by which it will be effected and the 
basis for settlement. (All contracts in excess of $10,000)
    (3) Compliance with Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, 
entitled ``Equal Employment Opportunity,'' as amended by Executive Order 
11375 of October 13, 1967, and as supplemented in Department of Labor 
regulations (41 CFR chapter 60). (All construction contracts awarded in 
excess of $10,000 by grantees and their contractors or subgrantees)

874) as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 3). 
(All contracts and subgrants for construction or repair)
    (5) Compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a to 276a-7) 
as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). 
(Construction contracts in excess of $2000 awarded by grantees and 
subgrantees when required by Federal grant program legislation)
    (6) Compliance with Sections 103 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours 
and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-330) as supplemented by 
Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). (Construction contracts 
awarded by grantees and subgrantees in excess of $2000, and in excess of 
$2500 for other contracts which involve the employment of mechanics or 
laborers)
    (7) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining to reporting.
    (8) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining to patent rights with respect to any discovery or invention 
which arises or is developed in the course of or under such contract.
    (9) Awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to

    (10) Access by the grantee, the subgrantee, the Federal grantor 
agency, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their 
duly authorized representatives to any books, documents, papers, and 
records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to that specific 
contract for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and 
transcriptions.
    (11) Retention of all required records for three years after 
grantees or subgrantees make final payments and all other pending 
matters are closed.
    (12) Compliance with all applicable standards, orders, or

Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations;
    (2) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon 
them by Federal statute and regulation;
    (3) Ensure that a provision for compliance with Sec. 1157.42 is 
placed in every cost reimbursement subgrant; and
    (4) Conform any advances of grant funds to subgrantees substantially 
to the same standards of timing and amount that apply to cash advances 
by Federal agencies.
    (b) All other grantees. All other grantees shall follow the 
provisions of this part which are applicable to awarding agencies when 
awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or 
fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal 
governments. Grantees shall:
    (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes a provision for compliance 
with this part;
    (2) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by 
Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations; 
and

    (4) Section 1157.50.

              Reports, Records, Retention, and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 1157.40  Monitoring and reporting program performance.

    (a) Monitoring by grantees. Grantees are responsible for managing 
the day-to-day operations of grant and subgrant supported activities. 
Grantees must monitor grant and subgrant supported activities to assure 
compliance with applicable Federal requirements and that performance 
goals are being achieved. Grantee monitoring must cover each program, 
function or activity.
    (b) Nonconstruction performance reports. The Federal agency may, if 
it decides that performance information available from subsequent 
applications contains sufficient information to meet its programmatic 
needs, require the grantee to submit a performance report only upon 
expiration or termination of grant support. Unless waived by the Federal 
agency this report will be due on the same date as the final Financial 
Status Report.
    (1) Grantees shall submit annual performance reports unless the 
awarding agency requires quarterly or semi-annual reports. However, 
performance reports will not be required more frequently than quarterly. 
Annual reports shall be due 90 days after the grant year, quarterly or 
semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The 
final performance report will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support. If a justified request is submitted by a 
grantee, the Federal agency may extend the due date for any performance 
report. Additionally, requirements for unnecessary performance reports 
may be waived by the Federal agency.
    (2) Performance reports will contain, for each grant, brief 
information on the following:
    (i) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives 
established for the period. Where the output of the project can be 
quantified, a computation of the cost per unit of output may be required 
if that information will be useful.
    (ii) The reasons for slippage if established objectives were not 
met.

[[Page 409]]

    (iii) Additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, 
analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
    (3) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of performance reports.
    (4) Grantees will adhere to the standards in this section in 
prescribing performance reporting requirements for subgrantees.
    (c) Construction performance reports. For the most part, on-site 
technical inspections and certified percentage-of-completion data are 
relied on heavily by Federal agencies to monitor progress under 
construction grants and subgrants. The Federal agency will require 
additional formal performance reports only when considered necessary, 
and never more frequently than quarterly.
    (d) Significant developments. Events may occur between the scheduled 
performance reporting dates which have significant impact upon the grant 
or subgrant supported activity. In such cases, the grantee must inform 
the Federal agency as soon as the following types of conditions become 
known:
    (1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially 
impair the ability to meet the objective of the award. This disclosure 
must include a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any 
assistance needed to resolve the situation.
    (2) Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and 
objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more 
beneficial results than originally planned.
    (e) Federal agencies may make site visits as warranted by program 
needs.
    (f) Waivers, extensions. (1) Federal agencies may waive any 
performance report required by this part if not needed.
    (2) The grantee may waive any performance report from a subgrantee 
when not needed. The grantee may extend the due date for any performance 
report from a subgrantee if the grantee will still be able to meet its 
performance reporting obligations to the Federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1157.41  Financial reporting.

    (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) (2) and (5) of 
this section, grantees will use only the forms specified in paragraphs 
(a) through (e) of this section, and such supplementary or other forms 
as may from time to time be authorized by OMB, for:
    (i) Submitting financial reports to Federal agencies, or
    (ii) Requesting advances or reimbursements when letters of credit 
are not used.
    (2) Grantees need not apply the forms prescribed in this section in 
dealing with their subgrantees. However, grantees shall not impose more 
burdensome requirements on subgrantees.
    (3) Grantees shall follow all applicable standard and supplemental 
Federal agency instructions approved by OMB to the extend required under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 for use in connection with forms 
specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. Federal 
agencies may issue substantive supplementary instructions only with the 
approval of OMB. Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the grantee 
to disregard any line item that the Federal agency finds unnecessary for 
its decisionmaking purposes.
    (4) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of forms required under this part.
    (5) Federal agencies may provide computer outputs to grantees to 
expedite or contribute to the accuracy of reporting. Federal agencies 
may accept the required information from grantees in machine usable 
format or computer printouts instead of prescribed forms.
    (6) Federal agencies may waive any report required by this section 
if not needed.
    (7) Federal agencies may extend the due date of any financial report 
upon receiving a justified request from a grantee.
    (b) Financial Status Report--(1) Form. Grantees will use Standard 
Form 269 or 269A, Financial Status Report, to report the status of funds 
for all nonconstruction grants and for construction grants when required 
in accordance with paragraph Sec. 1157.41(e)(2)(iii) of this section.

[[Page 410]]

    (2) Accounting basis. Each grantee will report program outlays and 
program income on a cash or accrual basis as prescribed by the awarding 
agency. If the Federal agency requires accrual information and the 
grantee's accounting records are not normally kept on the accural basis, 
the grantee shall not be required to convert its accounting system but 
shall develop such accrual information through and analysis of the 
documentation on hand.
    (3) Frequency. The Federal agency may prescribe the frequency of the 
report for each project or program. However, the report will not be 
required more frequently than quarterly. If the Federal agency does not 
specify the frequency of the report, it will be submitted annually. A 
final report will be required upon expiration or termination of grant 
support.
    (4) Due date. When reports are required on a quarterly or semiannual 
basis, they will be due 30 days after the reporting period. When 
required on an annual basis, they will be due 90 days after the grant 
year. Final reports will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support.
    (c) Federal Cash Transactions Report--(1) Form. (i) For grants paid 
by letter or credit, Treasury check advances or electronic transfer of 
funds, the grantee will submit the Standard Form 272, Federal Cash 
Transactions Report, and when necessary, its continuation sheet, 
Standard Form 272a, unless the terms of the award exempt the grantee 
from this requirement.
    (ii) These reports will be used by the Federal agency to monitor 
cash advanced to grantees and to obtain disbursement or outlay 
information for each grant from grantees. The format of the report may 
be adapted as appropriate when reporting is to be accomplished with the 
assistance of automatic data processing equipment provided that the 
information to be submitted is not changed in substance.
    (2) Forecasts of Federal cash requirements. Forecasts of Federal 
cash requirements may be required in the ``Remarks'' section of the 
report.
    (3) Cash in hands of subgrantees. When considered necessary and 
feasible by the Federal agency, grantees may be required to report the 
amount of cash advances in excess of three days' needs in the hands of 
their subgrantees or contractors and to provide short narrative 
explanations of actions taken by the grantee to reduce the excess 
balances.
    (4) Frequency and due date. Grantees must submit the report no later 
than 15 working days following the end of each quarter. However, where 
an advance either by letter of credit or electronic transfer of funds is 
authorized at an annualized rate of one million dollars or more, the 
Federal agency may require the report to be submitted within 15 working 
days following the end of each month.
    (d) Request for advance or reimbursement--(1) Advance payments. 
Requests for Treasury check advance payments will be submitted on 
Standard Form 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. (This form will 
not be used for drawdowns under a letter of credit, electronic funds 
transfer or when Treasury check advance payments are made to the grantee 
automatically on a predetermined basis.)
    (2) Reimbursements. Requests for reimbursement under nonconstruction 
grants will also be submitted on Standard Form 270. (For reimbursement 
requests under construction grants, see paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section.)
    (3) The frequency for submitting payment requests is treated in 
Sec. 1157.41(b)(3).
    (e) Outlay report and request for reimbursement for construction 
programs. (1) Grants that support construction activities paid by 
reimbursement method.
    (i) Requests for reimbursement under construction grants will be 
submitted on Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Federal agencies may, however, 
prescribe the Request for Advance or Reimbursement form, specified in 
Sec. 1157.41(d), instead of this form.
    (ii) The frequency for submitting reimbursement requests is treated 
in Sec. 1157.41(b)(3).
    (2) Grants that support construction activities paid by letter of 
credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advance.

[[Page 411]]

    (i) When a construction grant is paid by letter of credit, 
electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advances, the grantee will 
report its outlays to the Federal agency using Standard Form 271, Outlay 
Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The 
Federal agency will provide any necessary special instruction. However, 
frequency and due date shall be governed by Sec. 1157.41(b) (3) and (4).
    (ii) When a construction grant is paid by Treasury check advances 
based on periodic requests from the grantee, the advances will be 
requested on the form specified in Sec. 1157.41(d).
    (iii) The Federal agency may substitute the Financial Status Report 
specified in Sec. 1157.41(b) for the Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs.
    (3) Accounting basis. The accounting basis for the Outlay Report and 
Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs shall be governed by 
Sec. 1157.41(b)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 1157.42  Retention and access requirements for records.

    (a) Applicability. (1) This section applies to all financial and 
programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and 
other records of grantees or subgrantees which are:
    (i) Required to be maintained by the terms of this part, program 
regulations or the grant agreement, or
    (ii) Otherwise reasonably considered as pertinent to program 
regulations or the grant agreement.
    (2) This section does not apply to records maintained by contractors 
or subcontractors. For a requirement to place a provision concerning 
records in certain kinds of contracts, see Sec. 1157.36(i)(10).
    (b) Length of retention period. (1) Except as otherwise provided, 
records must be retained for three years from the starting date 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action 
involving the records has been started before the expiration of the 3-
year period, the records must be retained until completion of the action 
and resolution of all issues which arise from it, or until the end of 
the regular 3-year period, whichever is later.
    (3) To avoid duplicate recordkeeping, awarding agencies may make 
special arrangements with grantees and subgrantees to retain any records 
which are continuously needed for joint use. The awarding agency will 
request transfer of records to its custody when it determines that the 
records possess long-term retention value. When the records are 
transferred to or maintained by the Federal agency, the 3-year retention 
requirement is not applicable to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Starting date of retention period--(1) General. When grant 
support is continued or renewed at annual or other intervals, the 
retention period for the records of each funding period starts on the 
day the grantee or subgrantee submits to the awarding agency its single 
or last expenditure report for that period. However, if grant support is 
continued or renewed quarterly, the retention period for each year's 
records starts on the day the grantee submits its expenditure report for 
the last quarter of the Federal fiscal year. In all other cases, the 
retention period starts on the day the grantee submits its final 
expenditure report. If an expenditure report has been waived, the 
retention period starts on the day the report would have been due.
    (2) Real property and equipment records. The retention period for 
real property and equipment records starts from the date of the 
disposition or replacement or transfer at the direction of the awarding 
agency.
    (3) Records for income transactions after grant or subgrant support. 
In some cases grantees must report income after the period of grant 
support. Where there is such a requirement, the retention period for the 
records pertaining to the earning of the income starts from the end of 
the grantee's fiscal year in which the income is earned.
    (4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. This 
paragraph applies to the following types of documents, and their 
supporting records: Indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost 
allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at 
which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer

[[Page 412]]

usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).
    (i) If submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or other 
computation is required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to 
the grantee) to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-
year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of 
such submission.
    (ii) If not submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or 
other computation is not required to be submitted to the Federal 
Government (or to the grantee) for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year 
retention period for the proposal plan, or computation and its 
supporting records starts from end of the fiscal year (or other 
accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.
    (d) Substitution of microfilm. Copies made by microfilming, 
photocopying, or similar methods may be substituted for the original 
records.
    (e) Access to records--(1) Records of grantees and subgrantees. The 
awarding agency and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any 
of their authorized representatives, shall have the right of access to 
any pertinent books, documents, papers, or other records of grantees and 
subgrantees which are pertinent to the grant, in order to make audits, 
examinations, excerpts, and transcripts.
    (2) Expiration of right of access. The rights of access in this 
section must not be limited to the required retention period but shall 
last as long as the records are retained.
    (f) Restrictions on public access. The Federal Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) does not apply to records Unless required 
by Federal, State, or local law, grantees and subgrantees are not 
required to permit public access to their records.


<R05>
Sec. 1157.43  Enforcement.

    (a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a grantee or subgrantee 
materially fails to comply with any term of an award, whether stated in 
a Federal statute or regulation, an assurance, in a State plan or 
application, a notice of award, or elsewhere, the awarding agency may 
take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the 
circumstances:
    (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the 
deficiency by the grantee or subgrantee or more severe enforcement 
action by the awarding agency,
    (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and matching credit 
for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in 
compliance,
    (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award for the 
grantee's or subgrantee's program,
    (4) Withhold further awards for the program, or
    (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.
    (b) Hearings, appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the awarding 
agency will provide the grantee or subgrantee an opportunity for such 
hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the grantee 
or subgrantee is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to 
the action involved.
    (c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of grantee or 
subgrantee resulting from obligations incurred by the grantee or 
subgrantee during a suspension or after termination of an award are not 
allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the 
notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other grantee or 
subgrantee costs during suspension or after termination which are 
necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if:
    (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred 
by the grantee or subgrantee before the effective date of suspension or 
termination, are not in anticipation of it, and, in the case of a 
termination, are noncancellable, and,
    (2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or 
expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the 
termination takes effect.
    (d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement 
remedies identified in this section, including suspension and 
termination, do not preclude grantee or subgrantee from being subject to 
``Debarment and Suspension'' under E.O. 12549 (see Sec. 1157.35).

<R05>
Sec. 1157.44  Termination for convenience.

    Except as provided in Sec. 1157.43 awards may be terminated in whole 
or in part only as follows:
    (a) By the awarding agency with the consent of the grantee or 
subgrantee in which case the two parties shall agree upon the 
termination conditions, including the effective date and in the case of 
partial termination, the portion to be terminated, or
    (b) By the grantee or subgrantee upon written notification to the 
awarding agency, setting forth the reasons for such termination, the 
effective date, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to 
be terminated. However, if, in the case of a partial termination, the 
awarding agency determines that the remaining portion of the award will 
not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, the awarding 
agency may terminate the award in its entirety under either Sec. 1157.43 
or paragraph (a) of this section.

    (a) General. The Federal agency will close out the award when it 
determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required 
work of the grant has been completed.
    (b) Reports. Within 90 days after the expiration or termination of 
the grant, the grantee must submit all financial, performance, and other 
reports required as a condition of the grant. Upon request by the

In accordance with Sec. 1157.32(f), a grantee must submit an inventory 
of all federally owned property (as distinct from property acquired with 
grant funds) for which it is accountable and request disposition 
instructions from the Federal agency of property no longer needed.
    (c) Cost adjustment. The Federal agency will, within 90 days after 
receipt of reports in paragraph (b) of this section, make upward or 
downward adjustments to the allowable costs.
    (d) Cash adjustments. (1) The Federal agency will make prompt 
payment to the grantee for allowable reimbursable costs.
    (2) The grantee must immediately refund to the Federal agency any 
balance of unobligated (unencumbered) cash advanced that is not 
authorized to be retained for use on other grants.


<R05>
Sec. 1157.51  Later disallowances and adjustments.

    The closeout of a grant does not affect:
    (a) The Federal agency's right to disallow costs and recover funds 
on the basis of a later audit or other review;
    (b) The grantee's obligation to return any funds due as a result of 
later refunds, corrections, or other transactions;
    (c) Records retention as required in Sec. 1157.42;

Sec. 1157.52  Collection of amounts due.

    (a) Any funds paid to a grantee in excess of the amount to which the 
grantee is finally determined to be entitled under the terms of the 
award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a 
reasonable period after demand, the Federal agency may reduce the debt 
by:
    (1) Making an adminstrative offset against other requests for 
reimbursements,
    (2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the grantee, or
    (3) Other action permitted by law.
    (b) Except where otherwise provided by statutes or regulations, the 
Federal agency will charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance 
with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR Chapter II). The 
date from which interest is computed is not extended by

if required, with each submission that initiates agency consideration of 
such person for:
    (1) Award of a Federal contract, grant, or cooperative agreement 
exceeding $100,000; or

form, if required, under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Each person shall file a disclosure form at the end of each 
calendar quarter in which there occurs any event that requires 
disclosure or that materially affects the accuracy of the information

the accuracy of the information reported includes:
    (1) A cumulative increase of $25,000 or more in the amount paid or

Federal action; or
    (2) A change in the person(s) or individual(s) influencing or

(a) or (b) of this section. That person shall forward all disclosure 
forms to the agency.
    (f) Any certification or disclosure form filed under paragraph (e)

representation and shall not be shared by any tier to which the 
erroneous representation is forwarded. Submitting an erroneous 
certification or disclosure constitutes a failure to file the required 
certification or disclosure, respectively. If a person fails to file a 
required certification or disclosure, the United States may pursue all 
available remedies, including those authorized by section 1352, title

<R04>
                 Subpart B--Activities by Own Employees


<R05>
Sec. 1158.200  Agency and legislative liaison.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in 
Sec. 1158.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable 
compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if 
the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not 
directly related to a covered Federal action.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any 
information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable 
at any time.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following 
agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only 
where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered 
Federal action:
    (1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) 
the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, 
conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,
    (2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the 
application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an 
agency's use.
    (d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following 
agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where 
they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:
    (1) Providing any information not specifically requested but 
necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of 
a covered Federal action;
    (2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an 
unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,
    (3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an 
agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended 
by Pub. L. 95-507 and other subsequent amendments.
    (e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1158.205  Professional and technical services.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in 
Sec. 1158.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable 
compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or 
an extension, continuation, renewal,

[[Page 418]]

amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or 
cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical 
services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or 
negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal 
contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting 
requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving 
that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, professional and 
technical services shall be limited to advice and analysis directly 
applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting 
of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is 
allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the 
performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered 
directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, 
communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such 
as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed 
accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide 
advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical 
expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and 
solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered 
Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to 
influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis 
directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's 
proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not 
allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing 
professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent 
to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior 
to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable 
under this section since the engineer is providing technical services 
but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a 
covered Federal action.
    (c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for 
receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or 
regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, 
and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
    (d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1158.210  Reporting.

    No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable 
compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a 
person.


<R04>
            Subpart C--Activities by Other Than Own Employees


<R05>
Sec. 1158.300  Professional and technical services.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in 
Sec. 1158.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment 
to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional 
or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, 
or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal 
contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting 
requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving 
that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.
    (b) The reporting requirements in Sec. 1158.110 (a) and (b) 
regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall 
not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered 
directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any 
commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a 
loan.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, professional and 
technical services shall be limited to advice and analysis directly 
applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting 
or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is 
allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the 
performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered 
directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, 
communications with the intent to influence made by a

[[Page 419]]

professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as 
a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they 
provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or 
technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered 
directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a 
covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the 
intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or 
analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her 
client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are 
not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing 
professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent 
to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior 
to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable 
under this section since the engineer is providing technical services 
but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a 
covered Federal action.
    (d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for 
receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or 
regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, 
and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
    (e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting 
or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade 
associations.
    (f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.


<R04>
                  Subpart D--Penalties and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 1158.400  Penalties.

    (a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be 
subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than 
$100,000 for each such expenditure.
    (b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see 
Appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject 
to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 
for each such failure.
    (c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an 
administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced 
does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure 
occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with 
respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in 
writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.
    (d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount 
of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency 
shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the 
violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in 
business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability 
of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such 
other matters as may be appropriate.
    (e) First offenders under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall 
be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating 
circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be 
subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as 
determined by the agency head or his or her designee.
    (f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not 
prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply 
to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil 
penalty.


<R05>
Sec. 1158.405  Penalty procedures.

    Agencies shall impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the 
provisions of the Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. 
sections 3803 (except subsection (c)), 3804, 3805, 3806, 3807, 3808, and 
3812, insofar as these provisions are not inconsistent with the 
requirements herein.


<R05>
Sec. 1158.410  Enforcement.

    The head of each agency shall take such actions as are necessary to 
ensure that the provisions herein are vigorously implemented and

<R05>
Sec. 1160.2  Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities

    For the purposes of this part (45 CFR part 1160) the Federal Council 
on the Arts and the Humanities shall be composed of the Chairman of the 
National Endowment for the Arts, the Chairman of the National Endowment 
for the Humanities, the Secretary of Education, the Director of the 
National Science Foundation, the Librarian of Congress, the Chairman of 
the Commission of Fine Arts, the Archivist of the United States, the 
Commissioner, Public Buildings Service, General Services Administration, 
the Administrator of the General Services Administration, the Director 
of the United States Information Agency, the Secretary of the Interior, 
the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Transportation, the Chairman 
of the National Museum Services Board, the Director of the Institute of 
Museum Services, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the 
Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the 
Commissioner of the Administration on Aging.


<R05>
Sec. 1160.3  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this part:
    (a) Council means the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities 
as defined in Sec. 1160.2.
    (b) Letter of Intent means an agreement by the Council to provide an 
indemnity covering a future exhibition subject to compliance with all 
requirements at the date the indemnity is to be effective.
    (c) Lender means the owner of an object.
    (d) Eligible item means an object which qualifies for coverage under 
the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Act.
    (e) Exhibition means a public display of an indemnified items(s) at 
one or more locations, as approved by the Council, presented by any 
person, nonprofit agency or institution, or Government, in the United 
States or elsewhere.
    (f) On Exhibition means the period of time beginning on the date an 
indemnified item leaves the place designated by the lender and ending on 
the termination date.
    (g) Indemnity Agreement means the contract between the Council and 
the indemnitee covering loss or damage to indemnified items under the 
authority

[[Page 426]]

of the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Act.
    (h) Indemnitee means the party or parties to an indemnity agreement 
issued by the Council, to whom the promise of indemnification is made.
    (i) Participating institution(s) means the location(s) where an 
exhibition indemnified under this part will be displayed.
    (j) Termination date means the date thirty (30) calendar days after 
the date specified in the indemnity Certificate by which an indemnified 
item is to be returned to the place designated by the lender or the date 
on which the item is actually so returned, whichever date is earlier. 
(In museum terms this means wall-to-wall coverage.) After 11:59 p.m. on 
the termination date, the item is no longer covered by the indemnity 
agreement unless an extension has theretofore been requested by the 
indemnitee and granted in writing by the Council.


<R05>
Sec. 1160.4  Eligibility.

    An indemnity agreement made under these regulations shall cover:
    (a) Eligible items from outside the United States while on 
exhibition in the United States;
    (b) Eligible items from the United States while on exhibition 
outside this country, preferably when they are part of an exchange of 
exhibitions; and
    (c) Eligible items from the United States while on exhibition in the 
United States, in connection with other eligible items from outside the 
United States which are integral to the exhibition as a whole.

                                Example 1

    Museum A, an American art museum, is organizing a retrospective 
exhibition which will include more than 150 works of art by the 
Impressionist painter Auguste Renoir. The exhibition will present the 
full range of Renoir's production for the first time ever in an American 
museum. Museums B and C, large national museums in Paris and London, 
have agreed to lend 125 major works of art illustrating every aspect of 
Renoir's career. Museum A is also planning to include related works from 
other American public and private collections which have not been seen 
together since the artist's death in 1919. Museums D and E, major east 
coast American art museums, have agreed to lend 25 masterworks by 
Renoir. The exhibition will open in Chicago and travel to San Francisco 
and Washington.

                               Discussion

    Example 1 is a straightforward application of the amended indemnity 
regulations. Under the old regulations, only the works of art from 
Museums B and C, the foreign museums, would have been eligible for 
indemnification. Under the proposed Regulations, the works of art from 
American museums and other public and private collections also would be 
eligible for indemnification. In determining whether to indemnify the 
entire exhibition, the Federal Council will evaluate the exhibibition as 
a whole and whether the foreign loans are integral to the educational, 
cultural, historical or scientific significance of the exhibition. In 
this example, the Federal Council would likely approve indemnification 
of the entire exhibit.

                                Example 2

    Museum A in Massachusetts is organizing an exhibition celebrating 
250 Years of Decorative Arts in America, to be held in conjunction with 
the state's celebration of the millennium. Included among the objects to 
be borrowed from museums and historical societies in the United States 
are furniture, textiles, metalwork, ceramics, glass and jewelry, 
illustrating the best examples of American design from colonial times to 
the present. The curator traveled abroad recently and saw an exhibition 
of American quilts which have been acquired by a British decorative arts 
museums. He intends to borrow several of the quilts for the exhibition.

                               Discussion

    Example 2 raises the question as to whether the American museum 
organizing the exhibition has included the British-owned American quilts 
merely to obtain insurance relief. In determining whether to indemnify 
the entire exhibition, the Federal Council will evaluate the exhibition 
as a whole and whether the foreign loans are integral to achieving its 
educational, cultural and historical purposes. Here, it is likely that 
the Federal Council will conclude that the foreign work are not an 
essential component of the exhibition. The Federal Council also may seek 
additional information from the applicant to determine whether the 
objectives of the exhibition could have been accomplished as 
satisfactorily by borrowing American quilts from U.S. collections. On 
these facts, the Federal Council in all likelihood would deny 
indemnification for the entire exhibition.

                                Example 3

    Museum A, an American museum, is organizing an exhibition of the 
works of James Watkins, a nineteenth century American

[[Page 427]]

painter, focusing on his studies of human anatomy. Museum A has the 
foremost collection of preparatory drawings related to Watkins' major 
painting, ``The Surgeon and His Students.'' The painting is in the 
permanent collection of Museum B, located in the south of France, which 
has agreed to lend the painting for the exhibition. The exhibition will 
be shown at Museum B after the U.S. tour. American Universities, C and 
D, have also agreed to lend anatomical illustrations and drawings which 
show Watkins' development as a draughtsman. The exhibition and 
accompanying catalogue are expected to shed new light on Watkins 
contributions to art and scientific history.

                               Discussion

    Example 3 addresses the issue of whether the Federal Council will 
indemnify an exhibition even where the U.S. objects outnumber the 
foreign works. In determining whether to indemnify the entire 
exhibition, the Federal Council will evaluate the exhibition as a whole 
and the relationship of the foreign loans to the educational, cultural, 
historical and scientific significance of the exhibition. In this 
example, the exhibition promises to make important contributions not 
only to the history of art but also to the history of science. While 
there is only a single foreign work of art, it is clearly an essential 
component of the exhibition as a whole. The case for indemnification of 
the entire exhibition is further strengthened by the fact that a foreign 
masterpiece, which is closely related to the preparatory drawings and 
anatomical illustrations and drawings owned by American institutions, 
will be made available to the American public. Thus, the mere fact that 
the U.S. loans outnumber the foreign works will not in itself disqualify 
the entire exhibition for indemnification.

[60 FR 42466, Aug. 16, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1160.5  Application for indemnification.

    An applicant for an indemnity shall submit an Application for

<R04>
                 Subpart B--Activities by Own Employees


<R05>
Sec. 1168.200  Agency and legislative liaison.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in 
Sec. 1168.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable 
compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if 
the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not 
directly related to a covered Federal action.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any 
information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable 
at any time.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following 
agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only 
where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered 
Federal action:
    (1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) 
the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, 
conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,
    (2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the 
application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an 
agency's use.
    (d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following 
agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where 
they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:
    (1) Providing any information not specifically requested but 
necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of 
a covered Federal action;
    (2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an 
unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,
    (3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an 
agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended 
by Pub. L. 95-507 and other subsequent amendments.
    (e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1168.205  Professional and technical services.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in 
Sec. 1168.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable 
compensation made to an

[[Page 434]]

officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal 
contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, 
continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, 
grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or 
technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or 
negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal 
contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting 
requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving 
that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, ``professional 
and technical services'' shall be limited to advice and analysis 
directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, 
drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer 
is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the 
performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered 
directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, 
communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such 
as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed 
accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide 
advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical 
expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and 
solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered 
Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to 
influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis 
directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's 
proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not 
allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing 
professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent 
to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior 
to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable 
under this section since the engineer is providing technical services 
but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a 
covered Federal action.
    (c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for 
receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or 
regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, 
and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
    (d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1168.210  Reporting.

    No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable 
compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a 
person.


<R04>
            Subpart C--Activities by Other Than Own Employees


<R05>
Sec. 1168.300  Professional and technical services.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in 
Sec. 1168.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment 
to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional 
or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, 
or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal 
contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting 
requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving 
that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.
    (b) The reporting requirements in Sec. 1168.110 (a) and (b) 
regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall 
not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered 
directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any 
commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a 
loan.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, ``professional 
and technical services'' shall be limited to advice and analysis 
directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, 
drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer 
is allowable. Similarly,

[[Page 435]]

technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or 
operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the 
negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the 
intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) 
or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable 
under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly 
applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice 
or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, 
submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for 
example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer 
that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related 
to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally 
advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section 
because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. 
Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an 
engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or 
submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section 
since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in 
the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.
    (d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for 
receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or 
regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, 
and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
    (e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting 
or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade 
associations.
    (f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.


<R04>
                  Subpart D--Penalties and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 1168.400  Penalties.

    (a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be 
subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than 
$100,000 for each such expenditure.
    (b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see 
appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject 
to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 
for each such failure.
    (c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an 
administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced 
does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure 
occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with 
respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in 
writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.
    (d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount 
of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency 
shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the 
violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in 
business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability 
of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such 
other matters as may be appropriate.
    (e) First offenders under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall 
be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating 
circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be 
subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as 
determined by the agency head or his or her designee.
    (f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not 
prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply 
to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil 
penalty.


<R05>
Sec. 1168.405  Penalty procedures.

    Agencies shall impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the 
provisions of the Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. 
sections 3803 (except subsection (c)), 3804, 3805, 3806, 3807, 3808, and 
3812, insofar as these provisions are not inconsistent with the 
requirements herein.

    The head of each agency shall take such actions as are necessary to 
ensure that the provisions herein are vigorously implemented and 
enforced in that agency.

<R05>
Sec. 1168.500  Secretary of Defense.

    (a) The Secretary of Defense may exempt, on a case-by-case basis, a 
covered Federal action from the prohibition whenever the Secretary 
determines, in writing, that such an exemption is in the national 
interest. The Secretary shall transmit a copy of each such written 
exemption to Congress immediately after making such a determination.
    (b) The Department of Defense may issue supplemental regulations to

                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 1169.100  Purpose.

    (a) Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 provides that, to the extent 
permitted by law, Executive departments and agencies shall participate 
in a governmentwide system for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. 
A person who is debarred or suspended shall be excluded from Federal 
financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under Federal 
programs and activities. Debarment or suspension of a participant in a 
program by one agency shall have governmentwide effect.
    (b) These regulations implement section 3 of E.O. 12549 and the 
guidelines promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget under 
section 6 of the E.O. by:

[[Page 442]]

    (1) Prescribing the programs and activities that are covered by the 
governmentwide system;
    (2) Prescribing the governmentwide criteria and governmentwide 
minimum due process procedures that each agency shall use;
    (3) Providing for the listing of debarred and suspended 
participants, participants declared ineligible (see definition of 
``ineligible'' in Sec. 1169.105), and participants who have voluntarily 
excluded themselves from participation in covered transactions;
    (4) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, 
determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion; and
    (5) Offering such other guidance as necessary for the effective 
implementation and administration of the governmentwide system.
    (c) These regulations also implement Executive Order 12689 (3 CFR, 
1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Public Law 103-355, sec. 
2455, 108 Stat. 3327) by--
    (1) Providing for the inclusion in the List of Parties Excluded from 
Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs all persons proposed for 
debarment, debarred or suspended under the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation, 48 CFR Part 9, subpart 9.4; persons against which 
governmentwide exclusions have been entered under this part; and persons 
determined to be ineligible; and
    (2) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, 
determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion.
    (d) Although these regulations cover the listing of ineligible 
participants and the effect of such listing, they do not prescribe 
policies and procedures governing declarations of ineligibility.

<R05>
Sec. 1169.110  Coverage.

    (a) These regulations apply to all persons who have participated, 
are currently participating or may reasonably be expected to participate 
in transactions under Federal nonprocurement programs. For purposes of 
these regulations such transactions will be referred to as ``covered 
transactions.''
    (1) Covered transaction. For purposes of these regulations, a 
covered transaction is a primary covered transaction or a lower tier 
covered transaction. Covered transactions at any tier need not involve 
the transfer of Federal funds.
    (i) Primary covered transaction. Except as noted in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section, a primary covered transaction is any nonprocurement 
transaction between an agency and a person, regardless of type, 
including: grants, cooperative agreements, scholarships, fellowships, 
contracts of assistance, loans, loan guarantees, subsidies, insurance, 
payments for specified use, donation agreements and any other 
nonprocurement transactions between a Federal agency and a person. 
Primary covered transactions also include those transactions specially 
designated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in 
such agency's regulations governing debarment and suspension.
    (ii) Lower tier covered transaction. A lower tier covered 
transaction is:
    (A) Any transaction between a participant and a person other than a 
procurement contract for goods or services, regardless of type, under a 
primary covered transaction.
    (B) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a 
participant and a person, regardless of type, expected to equal or 
exceed the Federal procurement small purchase threshold fixed at 10 
U.S.C. 2304(g) and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) (currently $25,000) under a primary 
covered transaction.
    (C) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a 
participant and a person under a covered transaction, regardless of 
amount, under which that person will have a critical influence on or 
substantive control over that covered transaction. Such persons are:
    (1) Principal investigators.
    (2) Providers of federally-required audit services.
    (2) Exceptions. The following transactions are not covered:
    (i) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier 
awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including 
deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;
    (ii) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international 
organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign 
government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, entities 
consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities;
    (iii) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without 
regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received 
in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);
    (iv) Federal employment;
    (v) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized 
emergencies or disasters;
    (vi) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental 
operations; and
    (vii) Other transactions where the application of these regulations 
would be prohibited by law.
    (b) Relationship to other sections. This section describes the types 
of transactions to which a debarment or suspension under the regulations 
will apply. Subpart B, ``Effect of Action,'' Sec. 1169.200, ``Debarment 
or suspension,'' sets forth the consequences of a debarment or 
suspension. Those consequences would obtain only with respect to 
participants and principals in the covered transactions and activities 
described in Sec. 1169.110(a). Sections 1169.325, ``Scope of 
debarment,'' and 1169.420, ``Scope of suspension,'' govern

[[Page 445]]

the extent to which a specific participant or organizational elements of 
a participant would be automatically included within a debarment or 
suspension action, and the conditions under which affiliates or persons 
associated with a participant may also be brought within the scope of 
the action.
    (c) Relationship to Federal procurement activities. In accordance 
with E.O. 12689 and section 2455 of Public Law 103-355, any debarment, 
suspension, proposed debarment or other governmentwide exclusion 
initiated under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) on or after 
August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for Executive 
Branch agencies and participants as an exclusion under this regulation. 
Similarly, any debarment, suspension or other governmentwide exclusion 
initiated under this regulation on or after August 25, 1995 shall be 
recognized by and effective for those agencies as a debarment or 
suspension under the FAR.

[53 FR 19201, 19202, 19204, May 26, 1988, as amended at 60 FR 33041, 
33062, June 26, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1169.115  Policy.

    (a) In order to protect the public interest, it is the policy of the 
Federal Government to conduct business only with responsible persons. 
Debarment and suspension are discretionary actions that, taken in 
accordance with Executive Order 12549 and these regulations, are 
appropriate means to implement this policy.
    (b) Debarment and suspension are serious actions which shall be used 
only in the public interest and for the Federal Government's protection 
and not for purposes of punishment. Agencies may impose debarment or 
suspension for the causes and in accordance with the procedures set 
forth in these regulations.
    (c) When more than one agency has an interest in the proposed 
debarment or suspension of a person, consideration shall be given to 
designating one agency as the lead agency for making the decision. 
Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for 
coordinating their debarment or suspension actions.


<R04>
                       Subpart B--Effect of Action


<R05>
Sec. 1169.200  Debarment or suspension.

    (a) Primary covered transactions. Except to the extent prohibited by 
law, persons who are debarred or suspended shall be excluded from 
primary covered transactions as either participants or principals 
throughout the Executive Branch of the Federal Government for the period 
of their debarment, suspension, or the period they are proposed for 
debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4. Accordingly, no agency shall 
enter into primary covered transactions with such excluded persons 
during such period, except as permitted pursuant to Sec. 1169.215.
    (b) Lower tier covered transactions. Except to the extent prohibited 
by law, persons who have been proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 
9, subpart 9.4, debarred or suspended shall be excluded from 
participating as either participants or principals in all lower tier 
covered transactions (see Sec. 1169.110(a)(1)(ii)) for the period of 
their exclusion.
    (c) Exceptions. Debarment or suspension does not affect a person's 
eligibility for--
    (1) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier 
awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including 
deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;
    (2) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international 
organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign 
government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, and 
entities consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or 
foreign governmental entities;
    (3) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without 
regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received 
in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);
    (4) Federal employment;
    (5) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized 
emergencies or disasters;
    (6) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental 
operations; and

[[Page 446]]

    (7) Other transactions where the application of these regulations 
would be prohibited by law.

[60 FR 33041, 33062, June 26, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1169.205  Ineligible persons.

    Persons who are ineligible, as defined in Sec. 1169.105(i), are 
excluded in accordance with the applicable statutory, executive order, 
or regulatory authority.


<R05>
Sec. 1169.210  Voluntary exclusion.

    Persons who accept voluntary exclusions under Sec. 1169.315 are 
excluded in accordance with the terms of their settlements. NEH shall, 
and participants may, contact the original action agency to ascertain 
the extent of the exclusion.


<R05>
Sec. 1169.215  Exception provision.

    NEH may grant an exception permitting a debarred, suspended, or 
voluntarily excluded person, or a person proposed for debarment under 48 
CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, to participate in a particular covered 
transaction upon a written determination by the agency head or an 
authorized designee stating the reason(s) for deviating from the 
Presidential policy established by Executive Order 12549 and 
Sec. 1169.200. However, in accordance with the President's stated 
intention in the Executive Order, exceptions shall be granted only 
infrequently. Exceptions shall be reported in accordance with 
Sec. 1169.505(a).

[60 FR 33041, 33063, June 26, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1169.220  Continuation of covered transactions.

    (a) Notwithstanding the debarment, suspension, proposed debarment 
under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, determination of ineligibility, or 
voluntary exclusion of any person by an agency, agencies and 
participants may continue covered transactions in existence at the time 
the person was debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR 
part 9, subpart 9.4, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded. A 
decision as to the type of termination action, if any, to be taken 
should be made only after thorough review to ensure the propriety of the 
proposed action.
    (b) Agencies and participants shall not renew or extend covered 
transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any person who is 
debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 
9.4, ineligible or voluntary excluded, except as provided in 
Sec. 1169.215.

[60 FR 33041, 33062, June 26, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1169.225  Failure to adhere to restrictions.

    (a) Except as permitted under Sec. 1169.215 or Sec. 1169.220, a 
participant shall not knowingly do business under a covered transaction 
with a person who is--
    (1) Debarred or suspended;
    (2) Proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; or
    (3) Ineligible for or voluntarily excluded from the covered 
transaction.
    (b) Violation of the restriction under paragraph (a) of this section 
may result in disallowance of costs, annulment or termination of award, 
issuance of a stop work order, debarment or suspension, or other 
remedies as appropriate.
    (c) A participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective 
participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it and its 
principals are not debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 
CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the 
covered transaction (See Appendix B of these regulations), unless it 
knows that the certification is erroneous. An agency has the burden of 
proof that a participant did knowingly do business with a person that 
filed an erroneous certification.

<R05>
Sec. 1169.300  General.

    The debarring official may debar a person for any of the causes in 
Sec. 1169.305, using procedures established in Secs. 1169.310 through 
1169.314. The existence of a cause for debarment, however, does not 
necessarily require that the person be debarred; the seriousness of the 
person's acts or omissions and

[[Page 447]]

any mitigating factors shall be considered in making any debarment 
decision.


<R05>
Sec. 1169.305  Causes for debarment.

integrity or business honesty that seriously and directly affects the 
present responsibility of a person.
    (b) Violation of the terms of a public agreement or transaction so 
serious as to affect the integrity of an agency program, such as:
    (1) A willful failure to perform in accordance with the terms of one 
or more public agreements or transactions;
    (2) A history of failure to perform or of unsatisfactory performance 
of one or more public agreements or transactions; or

<R05>
Sec. 1169.310  Procedures.

    NEH shall process debarment actions as informally as practicable, 
consistent with the principles of fundamental fairness, using the 
procedures in Secs. 1169 .311 through 1169.314.


<R05>
Sec. 1169.311  Investigation and referral.

    Information concerning the existence of a cause for debarment from 
any source shall be promptly reported, investigated, and referred, when 
appropriate, to the debarring official for consideration. After 
consideration, the debarring official may issue a notice of proposed 
debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 1169 .312  Notice of proposed debarment.

    A debarment proceeding shall be initiated by notice to the 
respondent advising:
    (a) That debarment is being considered;
    (b) Of the reasons for the proposed debarment in terms sufficient to 
put the respondent on notice of the conduct or transaction(s) upon which 
it is based;
    (c) Of the cause(s) relied upon under Sec. 1169.305 for proposing 
debarment;
    (d) Of the provisions of Secs. 1169.311 through 1169.314, and any

[[Page 448]]

procedures, if applicable, governing debarment decisionmaking; and
    (e) Of the potential effect of a debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 1169.313  Opportunity to contest proposed debarment.

    (a) Submission in opposition. Within 30 days after receipt of the 
notice of proposed debarment, the respondent may submit, in person, in 
writing, or through a representative, information and argument in 
opposition to the proposed debarment.
    (b) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. (1) In 
actions not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, if the debarring 
official finds that the respondent's submission in opposition raises a 
genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment, 
respondent(s) shall be afforded an opportunity to appear with a 
representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and 
confront any witness the agency presents.
    (2) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be made 
available at cost to the respondent, upon request, unless the respondent 
and the agency, by mutual agreement, waive the requirement for a 
transcript.


<R05>
Sec. 1169.314  Debarring official's decision.

    (a) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions based upon a 
conviction or civil judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute 
over material facts, the debarring official shall make a decision on the 
basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any 
submission made by the respondent. The decision shall be made within 45 
days after receipt of any information and argument submitted by the 
respondent, unless the debarring official extends this period for good 
cause.
    (b) Additional proceedings necessary. (1) In actions in which 
additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material 
facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared. The debarring 
official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with 
any information and argument submitted by the respondent and any other 
information in the administrative record.
    (2) The debarring official may refer disputed material facts to 
another official for findings of fact. The debarring official may reject 
any such findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically 
determining them to be arbitrary and capricious or clearly erroneous.
    (3) The debarring official's decision shall be made after the 
conclusion of the proceedings with respect to disputed facts.
    (c)(1) Standard of proof. In any debarment action, the cause for 
debarment must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. Where 
the proposed debarment is based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the 
standard shall be deemed to have been met.
    (2) Burden of proof. The burden of proof is on the agency proposing 
debarment.
    (d) Notice of debarring official's decision. (1) If the debarring 
official decides to impose debarment, the respondent shall be given 
prompt notice:
    (i) Referring to the notice of proposed debarment;
    (ii) Specifying the reasons for debarment;
    (iii) Stating the period of debarment, including effective dates; 
and
    (iv) Advising that the debarment is effective for covered 
transactions throughout the executive branch of the Federal Government 
unless an agency head or an authorized designee makes the determination 
referred to in Sec. 1169.215.
    (2) If the debarring official decides not to impose debarment, the 
respondent shall be given prompt notice of that decision. A decision not 
to impose debarment shall be without prejudice to a subsequent 
imposition of debarment by any other agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1169.315  Settlement and voluntary exclusion.

    (a) When in the best interest of the Government, NEH may, at any 
time, settle a debarment or suspension action.
    (b) If a participant and the agency agree to a voluntary exclusion 
of the participant, such voluntary exclusion shall be entered on the 
Nonprocurement List (see subpart E).

[[Page 449]]


<R05>
Sec. 1169.320  Period of debarment.

    (a) Debarment shall be for a period commensurate with the 
seriousness of the cause(s). If a suspension precedes a debarment, the 
suspension period shall be considered in determining the debarment 
period.
    (1) Debarment for causes other than those related to a violation of 
the requirements of subpart F of this part generally should not exceed 
three years. Where circumstances warrant, a longer period of debarment 
may be imposed.
    (2) In the case of a debarment for a violation of the requirements 
of subpart F of this part (see Sec. 1169.305(c)(5)), the period of 
debarment shall not exceed five years.
    (b) The debarring official may extend an existing debarment for an 
additional period, if that official determines that an extension is 
necessary to protect the public interest. However, a debarment may not 
be extended solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon 
which the initial debarment action was based. If debarment for an 
additional period is determined to be necessary, the procedures of 
Secs. 1169.311 through 1169.314 shall be followed to extend the 
debarment.
    (c) The respondent may request the debarring official to reverse the 
debarment decision or to reduce the period or scope of debarment. Such a 
request shall be in writing and supported by documentation. The 
debarring official may grant such a request for reasons including, but 
not limited to:
    (1) Newly discovered material evidence;
    (2) Reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which the 
debarment was based;
    (3) Bona fide change in ownership or management;
    (4) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; 
or
    (5) Other reasons the debarring official deems appropriate.

1989]


<R05>
Sec. 1169.325  Scope of debarment.

    (a) Scope in general. (1) Debarment of a person under these 
regulations constitutes debarment of all its divisions and other 
organizational elements from all covered transactions, unless the 
debarment decision is limited by its terms to one or more specifically 
identified individuals, divisions or other organizational elements or to 
specific types of transactions.
    (2) The debarment action may include any affiliate of the 
participant that is specifically named and given notice of the proposed 
debarment and an opportunity to respond (see Secs. 1169.311 through 
1169.314).
    (b) Imputing conduct. For purposes of determining the scope of 
debarment, conduct may be imputed as follows:
    (1) Conduct imputed to participant. The fraudulent, criminal or 
other seriously improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, 
partner, employee, or other individual associated with a participant may 
be imputed to the participant when the conduct occurred in connection 
with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of the 
participant, or with the participant's knowledge, approval, or 
acquiescence. The participant's acceptance of the benefits derived from 
the conduct shall be evidence of such knowledge, approval, or 
acquiescence.
    (2) Conduct imputed to individuals associated with participant. The 
fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of a 
participant may be imputed to any officer, director, shareholder, 
partner, employee, or other individual associated with the participant 
who participated in, knew of, or had reason to know of the participant's 
conduct.
    (3) Conduct of one participant imputed to other participants in a 
joint venture. The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper 
conduct of one participant in a joint venture, grant pursuant to a joint 
application, or similar arrangement may be imputed to other participants 
if the conduct occurred for or on behalf of the joint venture, grant 
pursuant to a joint application, or similar arrangement may be imputed 
to other participants if the conduct occurred for or on behalf of the 
joint venture, grant pursuant to a joint application, or similar 
arrangement or with the knowledge, approval, or acquiescence of these 
participants. Acceptance

[[Page 450]]

of the benefits derived from the conduct shall be evidence of such 
knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.


<R04>
                          Subpart D--Suspension


<R05>
Sec. 1169.400  General.

    (a) The suspending official may suspend a person for any of the 
causes in Sec. 1169.405 using procedures established in Secs. 1169.410 
through 1169.413.
    (b) Suspension is a serious action to be imposed only when:
    (1) There exists adequate evidence of one or more of the causes set 
out in Sec. 1169.405, and
    (2) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.
    (c) In assessing the adequacy of the evidence, the agency should 
consider how much information is available, how credible it is given the 
circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, 
and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. This assessment 
should include an examination of basic documents such as grants, 
cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, and contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 1169.405  Causes for suspension.

    (a) Suspension may be imposed in accordance with the provisions of 
Secs. 1169.400 through 1169.413 upon adequate evidence:

Sec. 1169.305(a); or
    (2) That a cause for debarment under Sec. 1169.305 may exist.
    (b) Indictment shall constitute adequate evidence for purposes of 
suspension actions.


<R05>
Sec. 1169.410  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral. Information concerning the existence 
of a cause for suspension from any source shall be promptly reported, 
investigated, and referred, when appropriate, to the suspending official 
for consideration. After consideration, the suspending official may 
issue a notice of suspension.
    (b) Decisionmaking process. NEH shall process suspension actions as 
informally as practicable, consistent with principles of fundamental 
fairness, using the procedures in Sec. 1169.411 through Sec. 1169.413.

Sec. 1169.411  Notice of suspension.

    When a respondent is suspended, notice shall immediately be given:
    (a) That suspension has been imposed;
    (b) That the suspension is based on an indictment, conviction, or 
other adequate evidence that the respondent has committed irregularities 
seriously reflecting on the propriety of further Federal Government 
dealings with the respondent;
    (c) Describing any such irregularities in terms sufficient to put 
the respondent on notice without disclosing the Federal Government's 
evidence;
    (d) Of the cause(s) relied upon under Sec. 1169.405 for imposing 
suspension;
    (e) That the suspension is for a temporary period pending the

the suspension.
    (b) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. (1) If the 
suspending official finds that the respondent's submission in opposition 
raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension, 
respondent(s) shall be afforded an opportunity to appear with a 
representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and 
confront any witness the agency presents, unless:
    (i) The action is based on an indictment, conviction or civil 
judgment, or
    (ii) A determination is made, on the basis of Department of Justice 
advice, that the substantial interests of the Federal Government in 
pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on

[[Page 451]]

the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced.
    (2) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be 
prepared and made available at cost to the respondent, upon request, 
unless the respondent and the agency, by mutual agreement, waive the 
requirement for a transcript.


<R05>
Sec. 1169.413  Suspending official's decision.

    The suspending official may modify or terminate the suspension (for 
example, see Sec. 1169.320(c) for reasons for reducing the period or 
scope of debarment) or may leave it in force. However, a decision to 
modify or terminate the suspension shall be without prejudice to the 
subsequent imposition of suspension by any other agency or debarment by 
any agency. The decision shall be rendered in accordance with the 
following provisions:
    (a) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions: Based on an 
indictment, conviction, or civil judgment; in which there is no genuine 
dispute over material facts; or in which additional proceedings to 
determine disputed material facts have been denied on the basis of 
Department of Justice advice, the suspending official shall make a 
decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative 
record, including any submission made by the respondent. The decision 
shall be made within 45 days after receipt of any information and 
argument submitted by the respondent, unless the suspending official 
extends this period for good cause.
    (b) Additional proceedings necessary. (1) In actions in which 
additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material 
facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared. The suspending 
official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with 
any information and argument submitted by the respondent and any other 
information in the administrative record.
    (2) The suspending official may refer matters involving disputed 
material facts to another official for findings of fact. The suspending 
official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after 
specifically determining them to be arbitrary or capricious or clearly 
erroneous.
    (c) Notice of suspending official's decision. Prompt written notice 
of the suspending official's decision shall be sent to the respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 1169.415  Period of suspension.

    (a) Suspension shall be for a temporary period pending the 
completion of an investigation or ensuing legal, debarment, or Program 
Fraud Civil Remedies Act proceedings, unless terminated sooner by the 
suspending official or as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) If legal or administrative proceedings are not initiated within 
12 months after the date of the suspension notice, the suspension shall 
be terminated unless an Assistant Attorney General or United States 
Attorney requests its extension in writing, in which case it may be 
extended for an additional six months. In no event may a suspension 
extend beyond 18 months, unless such proceedings have been initiated 
within that period.
    (c) The suspending official shall notify the Department of Justice 
of an impending termination of a suspension, at least 30 days before the 
12-month period expires, to give that Department an opportunity to 
request an extension.


<R05>
Sec. 1169.420  Scope of suspension.

    The scope of a suspension is the same as the scope of a debarment 
(see Sec. 1169.325), except that the procedures of Secs. 1169.410 
through 1169.413 shall be used in imposing a suspension.

    (a) In accordance with the OMB guidelines, GSA shall compile, 
maintain, and distribute a list of all persons who have been debarred, 
suspended, or voluntarily excluded by agencies under Executive Order 
12549 and these regulations, and those who have been determined to be 
ineligible.
    (b) At a minimum, this list shall indicate:
    (1) The names and addresses of all debarred, suspended, ineligible, 
and voluntarily excluded persons, in alphabetical order, with cross-
references

[[Page 452]]

when more than one name is involved in a single action;
    (2) The type of action;

Sec. 1169.505  NEH responsibilities.

    (a) The agency shall provide GSA with current information concerning 
debarments, suspension, determinations of ineligibility, and voluntary 
exclusions it has taken. Until February 18, 1989, the agency shall also 
provide GSA and OMB with information concerning all transactions in 
which NEH has granted exceptions under Sec. 1169.215 permitting 
participation by debarred, suspended, or voluntarily excluded persons.
    (b) Unless an alternative schedule is agreed to by GSA, the agency 
shall advise GSA of the information set forth in Sec. 1169.500(b) and of 
the exceptions granted under Sec. 1169.215 within five working days 
after taking such actions.
    (c) The agency shall direct inquiries concerning listed persons to 
the agency that took the action.
    (d) NEH officials shall check the Nonprocurement List before 
entering covered transactions to determine whether a participant in a 
primary transaction is debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily 
excluded (Tel. ).
    (e) NEH officials shall check the Nonprocurement List before 
approving principals or lower tier participants where agency approval of 
the principal or lower tier participant is required under the terms of 
the transaction, to determine whether such principals or participants 
are debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded.


<R05>
Sec. 1169.510  Participants' responsibilities.

    (a) Certification by participants in primary covered transactions. 
Each participant shall submit the certification in appendix A to this 
part for it and its principals at the time the participant submits its 
proposal in connection with a primary covered transaction, except that 
States need only complete such certification as to their principals. 
Participants may decide the method and frequency by which they determine 
the eligibility of their principals. In addition, each participant may, 
but is not required to, check the Nonprocurement List for its principals 
(Tel. ). Adverse information on the certification will not necessarily 
result in denial of participation. However, the certification, and any 
additional information pertaining to the certification submitted by the 
participant, shall be considered in the administration of covered 
transactions.
    (b) Certification by participants in lower tier covered 
transactions. (1) Each participant shall require participants in lower 
tier covered transactions to include the certification in appendix B to 
this part for it and its principals in any proposal submitted in 
connection with such lower tier covered transactions.
    (2) A participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective 
participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it and its 
principals are not debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily 
excluded from the covered transaction by any Federal agency, unless it 
knows that the certification is erroneous. Participants may decide the 
method and frequency by which they determine the eligiblity of their 
principals. In addition, a participant may, but is not required to, 
check the Nonprocurement List for its principals and for participants 
(Tel. ).
    (c) Changed circumstances regarding certification. A participant 
shall provide immediate written notice to NEH if at any time the 
participant learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted 
or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. Participants 
in lower tier covered transactions shall provide the same updated notice 
to the participant to which it submitted its proposals.

Sec. 1169.630  Certification requirements and procedures.

    (a)(1) As a prior condition of being awarded a grant, each grantee 
shall make the appropriate certification to the Federal agency providing 
the grant, as provided in appendix C to this part.
    (2) Grantees are not required to make a certification in order to 
continue receiving funds under a grant awarded before March 18, 1989, or 
under a no-cost time extension of such a grant. However, the grantee 
shall make a one-time drug-free workplace certification for a non-
automatic continuation of

[[Page 455]]

such a grant made on or after March 18, 1989.
    (b) Except as provided in this section, all grantees shall make the 
required certification for each grant. For mandatory formula grants and 
entitlements that have no application process, grantees shall submit a 
one-time certification in order to continue receiving awards.
    (c) A grantee that is a State may elect to make one certification in 
each Federal fiscal year. States that previously submitted an annual 
certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 
1990 until June 30, 1990. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, this certification shall cover all grants to all State agencies 
from any Federal agency. The State shall retain the original of this 
statewide certification in its Governor's office and, prior to grant 
award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with respect 
to each grant, unless the Federal agency has designated a central 
location for submission.
    (d)(1) The Governor of a State may exclude certain State agencies 
from the statewide certification and authorize these agencies to submit 
their own certifications to Federal agencies. The statewide 
certification shall name any State agencies so excluded.
    (2) A State agency to which the statewide certification does not 
apply, or a State agency in a State that does not have a statewide 
certification, may elect to make one certification in each Federal 
fiscal year. State agencies that previously submitted a State agency 
certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 
1990 until June 30, 1990. The State agency shall retain the original of 
this State agency-wide certification in its central office and, prior to 
grant award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with 
respect to each grant, unless the Federal agency designates a central 
location for submission.
    (3) When the work of a grant is done by more than one State agency, 
the certification of the State agency directly receiving the grant shall 
be deemed to certify compliance for all workplaces, including those 
located in other State agencies.
    (e)(1) For a grant of less than 30 days performance duration, 
grantees shall have this policy statement and program in place as soon 
as possible, but in any case by a date prior to the date on which 
performance is expected to be completed.
    (2) For a grant of 30 days or more performance duration, grantees 
shall have this policy statement and program in place within 30 days 
after award.
    (3) Where extraordinary circumstances warrant for a specific grant, 
the grant officer may determine a different date on which the policy 
statement and program shall be in place.


<R05>
Sec. 1169.635  Reporting of and employee sanctions for convictions of criminal drug offenses.

    (a) When a grantee other than an individual is notified that an 
employee has been convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute 
occurring in the workplace, it shall take the following actions:
    (1) Within 10 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, 
the grantee shall provide written notice, including the convicted 
employee's position title, to every grant officer, or other designee on 
whose grant activity the convicted employee was working, unless a 
Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt of such 
notifications. Notification shall include the identification number(s) 
for each of the Federal agency's affected grants.
    (2) Within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, 
the grantee shall do the following with respect to the employee who was 
convicted.
    (i) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to 
and including termination, consistent with requirements of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; or
    (ii) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug 
abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by 
a Federal, State, or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate 
agency.
    (b) A grantee who is an individual who is convicted for a violation 
of a criminal drug statute occurring during the conduct of any grant 
activity shall

[[Page 456]]

report the conviction, in writing, within 10 calendar days, to his or 
her Federal agency grant officer, or other designee, unless the Federal 
agency has designated a central point for the receipt of such notices. 
Notification shall include the identification number(s) for each of the 
Federal agency's affected grants.

Appendix A to Part 1169--Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, 
     and Other Responsibility Matters--Primary Covered Transactions

                     Instructions for Certification

    1. By signing and submitting this proposal, the prospective primary 
participant is providing the certification set out below.
    2. The inability of a person to provide the certification required 
below will not necessarily result in denial of participation in this 
covered transaction. The prospective participant shall submit an 
explanation of why it cannot provide the certification set out below. 
The certification or explanation will be considered in connection with 
the department or agency's determination whether to enter into this 
transaction. However, failure of the prospective primary participant to 
furnish a certification or an explanation shall disqualify such person 
from participation in this transaction.
    3. The certification in this clause is a material representation of 
fact upon which reliance was placed when the department or agency 
determined to enter into this transaction. If it is later determined 
that the prospective primary participant knowingly rendered an erroneous 
certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal 
Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for 
cause or default.
    4. The prospective primary participant shall provide immediate 
written notice to the department or agency to which this proposal is 
submitted if at any time the prospective primary participant learns that 
its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous 
by reason of changed circumstances.
    5. The terms covered transaction, debarred, suspended, ineligible, 
lower tier covered transaction, participant, person, primary covered 
transaction, principal, proposal, and voluntarily excluded, as used in 
this clause, have the meanings set out in the Definitions and Coverage 
sections of the rules implementing Executive Order 12549. You may 
contact the department or agency to which this proposal is being 
submitted for assistance in obtaining a copy of those regulations.
    6. The prospective primary participant agrees by submitting this 
proposal that, should the proposed covered transaction be entered into, 
it shall not knowingly enter into any lower tier covered transaction 
with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 
9.4, debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded 
from participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized by the 
department or agency entering into this transaction.
    7. The prospective primary participant further agrees by submitting 
this proposal that it will include the clause titled ``Certification 
Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion-
Lower Tier Covered Transaction,'' provided by the department or agency 
entering into this covered transaction, without modification, in all 
lower tier covered transactions and in all solicitations for lower tier 
covered transactions.
    8. A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a 
certification of a prospective participant in a lower tier covered 
transaction that it is not proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, 
subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded 
from the covered transaction, unless it knows that the certification is 
erroneous. A participant may decide the method and frequency by which it 
determines the eligibility of its principals. Each participant may, but 
is not required to, check the List of Parties Excluded from Federal 
Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.
    9. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require 
establishment of a system of records in order to render in good faith 
the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and information 
of a participant is not required to exceed that which is normally 
possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business 
dealings.
    10. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 6 of these 
instructions, if a participant in a covered transaction knowingly enters 
into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for 
debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, suspended, debarred,

  Appendix C to Part 1169--Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace 
                              Requirements

                     Instructions for Certification

    1. By signing and/or submitting this application or grant agreement, 
the grantee is providing the certification set out below.
    2. The certification set out below is a material representation of 
fact upon which reliance is placed when the agency awards the grant. If 
it is later determined that the grantee knowingly rendered a false 
certification, or otherwise violates the requirements of the Drug-Free 
Workplace Act, the agency, in addition to any other remedies available 
to the Federal Government, may take action authorized under the Drug-
Free Workplace Act.
    3. For grantees other than individuals, Alternate I applies.
    4. For grantees who are individuals, Alternate II applies.
    5. Workplaces under grants, for grantees other than individuals, 
need not be identified on the certification. If known, they may be 
identified in the grant application. If the grantee does not identify 
the workplaces at the time of application, or upon award, if there is no 
application, the grantee must keep the identity of the workplace(s) on 
file in its office and make the information available for Federal 
inspection. Failure to identify all known workplaces constitutes a 
violation of the grantee's drug-free workplace requirements.
    6. Workplace identifications must include the actual address of 
buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the 
grant takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (e.g., all 
vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while 
in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, 
performers in concert halls or radio studios).
    7. If the workplace identified to the agency changes during the 
performance of the grant, the grantee shall inform the agency of the 
change(s), if it previously identified the workplaces in question (see 
paragraph five).
    8. Definitions of terms in the Nonprocurement Suspension and 
Debarment common rule and Drug-Free Workplace common rule apply to this 
certification. Grantees' attention is called, in particular, to the 
following definitions from these rules:
    Controlled substance means a controlled substance in Schedules I 
through V of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812) and as 
further defined by regulation (21 CFR 1308.11 through 1308.15);
    Conviction means a finding of guilt (including a plea of nolo 
contendere) or imposition of sentence, or both, by any judicial body 
charged with the responsibility to determine violations of the Federal 
or State criminal drug statutes;
    Criminal drug statute means a Federal or non-Federal criminal 
statute involving the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, use, or 
possession of any controlled substance;
    Employee means the employee of a grantee directly engaged in the 
performance of work under a grant, including: (i) All direct charge 
employees; (ii) All indirect charge employees unless their impact or 
involvement is insignificant to the performance of the grant; and, (iii) 
Temporary personnel and consultants who are directly engaged in the 
performance of work under the grant and who are on the grantee's 
payroll. This definition does not include workers not on the payroll of 
the grantee (e.g., volunteers, even if used to meet a matching 
requirement; consultants or independent contractors not on the grantee's 
payroll; or employees of subrecipients or subcontractors in covered 
workplaces).

        Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace Requirements

             Alternate I. (Grantees Other Than Individuals)

    A. The grantee certifies that it will or will continue to provide a 
drug-free workplace by:

performance of the grant be given a copy of the statement required by 
paragraph (a);
    (d) Notifying the employee in the statement required by paragraph 
(a) that, as a condition of employment under the grant, the employee 
will--
    (1) Abide by the terms of the statement; and
    (2) Notify the employer in writing of his or her conviction for a 
violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace no later 
than five calendar days after such conviction;
    (e) Notifying the agency in writing, within ten calendar days after 
receiving notice under paragraph (d)(2) from an employee or otherwise 
receiving actual notice of such conviction. Employers of convicted 
employees must provide notice, including position title, to every grant 
officer or other designee on whose grant activity the convicted employee 
was working, unless the Federal agency has designated a central point 
for the receipt of such notices. Notice shall include the identification 
number(s) of each affected grant;
    (f) Taking one of the following actions, within 30 calendar days of 
receiving notice under paragraph (d)(2), with respect to any employee

here.

              Alternate II. (Grantees Who Are Individuals)

    (a) The grantee certifies that, as a condition of the grant, he or 
she will not engage in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, 
dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance in conducting 
any activity with the grant;
    (b) If convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a 
violation occurring during the conduct of any grant activity, he or she 
will report the conviction, in writing, within 10 calendar days of the 
conviction, to every grant officer or other designee, unless the Federal 
agency designates a central point for the receipt of such notices. When

different programs or activities.
    (c) A recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other 
arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration.
    (1) that have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons

    (2) that have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially 
impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the program or 
activity with respect to handicapped persons.
    (e) The exclusion of nonhandicapped persons from the benefits of a 
program limited by Federal statute or executive

[[Page 463]]

<R05>
Sec. 1170.13  Illustrative examples.

    (a) The following examples will illustrate the application of the 
foregoing provisions to some of the activities funded by the National 
Endowment for the Humanities.
    (1) A publication or a museum catalogue supported by the Endowment 
may be made usable by the blind and the visually impaired through 
cassette tapes, records, discs, braille, readers and simultaneous 
publications.
    (2) A lecture, meeting or symposium supported by Federal funds may 
be made available to deaf and hearing impaired persons through the use 
of a sign language interpreter or by providing scripts in advance of the 
performance.
    (3) Specific programs supported by Federal funds may be offered in 
an inaccessible facility provided that the same program is also offered 
to the public at large in an accessible space.
    (4) A qualified handicapped person is one who is able to meet all of 
a program's requirements in spite of his handicap. An educational 
institution is not required to disregard the disabilities of handicapped 
individuals or to lower or to make substantial modifications of 
standards to accommodate a handicapped person.
    (b) State humanities committees are obligated to develop methods of 
administering Federal funds so as to ensure that handicapped persons are 
not subjected to discrimination on the basis of handicap either by sub-
grantees or by the manner in which the funds are distributed.
    (c) In the event Endowment funds are utilized to construct, expand, 
alter, lease or rent a facility, the benefits of the programs and 
activities provided in or through that facility must be conducted in 
accordance with these regulations, e.g., a museum receiving a grant to 
renovate an existing facility must assure that all museum programs and 
activities conducted in that facility are accessible to handicapped 
persons.
    (d) In carrying out the mandate of section 504 and these 
implementing regulations recipients should administer Endowment assisted 
programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate, 
e.g., tours made available to the hearing impaired should be open to the 
public at large and everyone should be permitted to enjoy the benefits 
of a tactile experience in a museum.

recipient, is shown to be job-related for the position in question; and
    (2) Alternative job-related tests or criteria are unavailable.
    (b) A recipient shall select and administer tests concerning 
employment so as best to ensure that, when administered to an applicant

skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's or 
employee's job skills, aptitude, or other factors relevant to adequate 
performance of the job in question.


<R05>
Sec. 1170.24  Preemployment inquiries.

    (a) A recipient may not, except as provided below, conduct a 
preemployment medical examination, make preemployment inquiry as to 
whether the applicant is a handicapped person, or inquire as to the 
nature or severity of a handicap. A recipient may, however, make 
preemployment inquiry into an applicant's ability to perform job-related 
functions.
    (b) If a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the effects 
of past discrimination, if a recipient is taking voluntary action to 
overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited 
participation in its federally assisted program or activity, or if a 
recipient is taking affirmative action under section 503 of the 
Rehabilitation Act, the recipient may invite applicants for employment 
to indicate

[[Page 465]]

whether and to what extent they are handicapped, provided, that:
    (1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used 
for this purpose or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is 
used that the information requested is intended for use solely in 
connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary or 
affirmative action efforts; and
    (2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being 
requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential as 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section, that refusal to provide it 
will not subject the applicant or employee to any adverse treatment, and 
that it will be used only in accordance with this part.
    (c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from 
conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical 
examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty, 
provided, that:
    (1) All entering employees are subjected to such an examination 
regardless of handicap; and
    (2) The results of such an examination are used only in accordance 
with the requirements of this part.
    (d) Information obtained in accordance with this section as to the 
medical condition or history of the applicant shall be collected and

                    Subpart D--Program Accessibility


<R05>
Sec. 1170.31  Discrimination prohibited.

    No qualified handicapped person shall, because recipient's 
facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be 
denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise 
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity to which 
this part applies.


<R05>
Sec. 1170.32  Existing facilities.

    (a) Program accessibility. A recipient shall operate each program or 
activity to which this part applies so that the program or activity, 
when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to handicapped 
persons. This paragraph does not necessarily require a recipient to make 
each of its existing facilities or every part of a facility accessible 
to and usable by handicapped persons.
    (b) Methods. A recipient may comply with the requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible 
buildings, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new 
facilities in conformance with the requirements of Sec. 1170.33, or any 
other methods that result in making its program or activity accessible 
to handicapped persons. A recipient is not required to make structural 
changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in 
achieving compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing 
among available methods for meeting the requirement of paragraph (a) of 
this section, a recipient shall give priority to those methods that 
offer program and activities to handicapped persons in the most 
integrated setting appropriate.
    (c) Time period. A recipient shall comply with the requirement of 
paragraph (a) of this section within sixty days of the effective date of 
this part except that where structural changes in facilities are 
necessary, such changes shall be made within three years of the 
effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities are necessary to meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of 
this section, a recipient shall develop, within one year of the 
effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps 
necessary to complete such changes. The

[[Page 466]]

plan shall be developed with the assistance of interested persons, 
including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped 
persons. A copy of the transition plan shall be made available upon 
request for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum:
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its program or activity to handicapped 
persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
full program accessibility and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify the steps that will be taken 
during each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the person responsible for implementation of the plan.
    (e) Notice. The recipient shall adopt and implement procedures to 
ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision 
or hearing can obtain information as to the existence and location of 
services, activities, and facilities that are accessible to and usable 
by handicapped persons.


<R05>
Sec. 1170.33  New construction.

    (a) Design, construction, and alteration. New facilities shall be 
designed and constructed to be readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. Alterations to existing facilities shall, to the 
maximum extent feasible, be designed and constructed to be readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.
    (b) Conformance with Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards. (1) 
Effective as of January 18, 1991, design, construction, or alteration of 
buildings in conformance with sections 3-8 of the Uniform Federal 
Accessibility Standards (USAF) (appendix A to 41 CFR subpart 101-19.6) 
shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with 
respect to those buildings. Departures from particular technical and 
scoping requirements of UFAS by the use of other methods are permitted 
where substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of the 
building is provided.
    (2) For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall 
be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical 
rooms and other spaces that, because of their intended use, will not 
require accessibility to the public or beneficiaries or result in the 
employment or residence therein of persons with physical handicaps.
    (3) This section does not require recipients to make building 
alterations that have little likelihood of being accomplished without 
removing or altering a load-bearing structural member.

Sec. 1170.42  Admissions and recruitment.

    (a) General. Qualified handicapped persons may not, on the basis of 
handicap, be denied admission or be subjected to discrimination in 
admission or recruitment by a recipient to which this subpart applies.
    (b) Admissions. In administering its admission policies, a recipient 
to which this subpart applies:
    (1) May not apply limitations upon the number or proportion of 
handicapped persons who may be admitted;
    (2) May not make use of any test or criterion for admission that has 
a disproportionate, adverse effect on handicapped persons or any class 
of handicapped persons unless

[[Page 467]]

    (i) The test or criterion, as used by the recipient, has been 
validated as a predictor of success in the education program or activity 
in question and
    (ii) Alternate tests or criteria that have a less disproportionate, 
adverse effect are not shown by the Chairman to be available.
    (3) Shall assure itself that:
    (i) Admissions tests are selected and administered so as best to 
ensure that, when a test is administered to an applicant who has a 
handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test 
results accurately reflect the applicant's aptitude or achievement level 
or whatever other factor the test purports to measure, rather than 
reflecting the applicant's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills 
(except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to 
measure);
    (ii) Admissions tests that are designed for persons with impaired 
sensory, manual, or speaking skills are offered as often and in as 
timely a manner as are other admissions tests; and
    (iii) Admissions tests are administered in facilities that, on the 
whole, are accessible to handicapped persons; and
    (4) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, may not 
make preadmission inquiry as to whether an applicant for admission is a 
handicapped person but, after admission, may make inquiries on a 
confidential basis as to handicaps that may require accommodation.
    (c) Preadmission inquiry exception. When a recipient is taking 
remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination pursuant 
to Sec. 1170.52(a) or when a recipient is taking voluntary action to 
overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited 
participation in its federally assisted program or activity pursuant to 
Sec. 1170.52(b), the recipient may invite applicants for admission to 
indicate whether and to what extent they are handicapped, provided, 
that:
    (1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used 
for this purpose or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is 
used that the information requested is intended for use solely in 
connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary action 
efforts; and
    (2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being 
requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential, that 
refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant to any adverse 
treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this part.
    (d) Validity studies. For the purpose of paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, a recipient may base prediction equations on first year grades, 
but shall conduct periodic validity studies against the criterion of 
overall success in the education program or activity in question in 
order to monitor the general validity of the test scores.


<R05>
Sec. 1170.43  Treatment of students; general.

    (a) No qualified handicapped student shall, on the basis of 
handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, 
or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any academic, 
research, occupational training, housing, health insurance, counseling, 
financial aid, physical education, athletics, recreation, 
transportation, or other postsecondary education program or activity to 
which this subpart applies.
    (b) A recipient to which this subpart applies that considers 
participation by students in education programs or activities not 
operated wholly by the recipient as part of, or equivalent to, an 
education program or activity operated by the recipient shall assure 
itself that the other education program or activity, as a whole, 
provides an equal opportunity for the participation of qualified 
handicapped persons.
    (c) A recipient to which this subpart applies may not, on the basis 
of handicap, exclude any qualified handicapped student from any course, 
course of study, or other part of its education program or activity.

programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 1170.44  Academic adjustments.

    (a) Academic requirements. A recipient to which this subpart applies 
shall

[[Page 468]]

make such modifications to its academic requirements as are necessary to 
ensure that such requirements do not discriminate or have the effect of 
discriminating, on the basis of handicap, against a qualified 
handicapped applicant or student. Academic requirements that the 
recipient can demonstrate are essential to the program of instruction 
being pursued by such student or to any directly related licensing 
requirement will not be regarded as discriminatory within the meaning of 
this section. Modifications may include changes in the length of time 
permitted for the completion of degree requirements, substitution of 
specific courses required for the completion of degree requirements, and 
adaptation of the manner in which specific courses are conducted.
    (b) Other rules. A recipient to which this subpart applies may not 
impose upon handicapped students other rules, such as the prohibitation 
of tape recorders in classrooms or of dog guides in campus buildings, 
that have the effect of limiting the participation of handicapped 
students in the recipient's education program or activity.
    (c) Course examinations. In its course examinations or other 
procedures for evaluating students' academic achievement in its program, 
a recipient to which this subpart applies shall provide such methods for 
evaluating the achievement of students who have a handicap that impairs 
sensory, manual, or speaking skills as will best ensure that the results 
of the evaluation represents the student's achievement in the course, 
rather than reflecting the student's impaired sensory, manual, or 
speaking skills (except where such skills are the factors that the test 
purports to measure).
    (d) Auxiliary aids. (1) A recipient to which this subpart applies 
shall take such steps as are necessary to ensure that no handicapped 
student is denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or 
otherwise subjected to discrimination under the education program or 
activity operated by the recipient because of the absence of educational 
auxiliary aids for students with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking 
skills.
    (2) Auxiliary aids may include taped texts, interpreters or other 
effective methods of making orally delivered materials available to 
students with hearing impairments, readers in libraries for students 
with visual impairments, classroom equipment adapted for use by students 
with manual impairments, and other similar services and actions. 
Recipients need not provide attendants, individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices or services of a 
personal nature.


<R05>
Sec. 1170.45  Housing.

    (a) Housing provided by the recipient. A recipient that provides 
housing to its nonhandicapped students shall provide comparable, 
convenient, and accessible housing to handicapped students at the same 
cost as to others. At the end of the transition period provided for in 
Subpart D, such housing shall be available in sufficient quantity and 
variety so that the scope of handicapped students' choice of living 
accommodations is, as a whole, comparable to that of nonhandicapped 
students.
    (b) Other housing. A recipient that assists any agency, 
organization, or person in making housing available to any of its 
students shall take such action as may be necessary to assure itself 
that such housing is, as a whole, made available in a manner that does 
not result in discrimination on the basis of handicap.


<R05>
Sec. 1170.46  Financial and employment assistance to students.

    (a) Provision of financial assistance. (1) In providing financial 
assistance to qualified handicapped persons, a recipient to which this 
subpart applies may not
    (i) On the basis of handicap, provide less assistance than is 
provided to nonhandicapped persons, limit eligibility for assistance, or 
otherwise discriminate or
    (ii) Assist any entity or person that provides assistance to any of 
the recipient's students in a manner that discriminates against 
qualified handicapped persons on the basis of handicap.

[[Page 469]]

    (2) A recipient may administer or assist in the administration of 
scholarships, fellowships, or other forms of financial assistance 
established under wills, trusts, bequests, or similar legal instruments 
that require awards to be made on the basis of factors that discriminate 
or have the effect of discriminating on the basis of handicap only if 
the overall effect of the award of scholarships, fellowships, and other 
forms of financial assistance is not discriminatory on the basis of 
handicap.
    (b) Assistance in making available outside employment. A recipient 
that assists any agency, organization, or person in providing employment 
opportunities to any of its students shall assure itself that such 
employment opportunities, as a whole, are made available in a manner 
that would not violate Subpart C if they were provided by the recipient.
    (c) Employment of students by recipients. A recipient that employs 
any of its students may not do so in a manner that violates Subpart C.


<R05>
Sec. 1170.47  Nonacademic services.

    (a) Physical education and athletics. (1) In providing physical 
education courses and athletics and similar programs and activities to 
any of its students, a recipient to which this subpart applies may not 
discriminate on the basis of handicap. A recipient that offers physical 
education courses or that operates or sponsors intercollegiate, club, or 
intramural athletics shall provide to qualified handicapped students an 
equal opportunity for participation in these activities.
    (2) A recipient may offer to handicapped students physical education 
and athletic activities that are separate or different only if 
separation or differentiation is consistent with the requirements of 
Sec. 1170.43(d) and only if no qualified handicapped student is denied 
the opportunity to compete for teams or to participate in courses that 
are not separate or different.
    (b) Counseling and placement services. A recipient to which this 
subpart applies that provides personal, academic, or vocational 
counseling, guidance, or placement services to its students shall 
provide these services without discrimination on the basis of handicap. 
The recipient shall ensure that qualified handicapped students are not 
counseled toward more restrictive career objectives than are 
nonhandicapped students with similar interests and abilities. This 
requirement does not preclude a recipient from providing factual 
information about licensing and certification requirements that may 
present obstacles to handicapped persons in their pursuit of particular 
careers.
    (c) Social organizations. A recipient that provides significant 
assistance to fraternities, sororities, or similar organizations shall

permit discrimination otherwise prohibited by this subpart.

                         Subpart F--Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 1170.51  Assurances required.

    (a) Assurances. An applicant for Federal financial assistance for a 
program or activity to which this part applies shall submit an 
assurance, on a form specified by the responsible Endowment official, 
that the program will be operated in compliance with this part. An 
applicant may incorporate these assurances by reference in subsequent 
applications to the Endowment.
    (b) Duration of obligation. (1) In the case of Federal financial 
assistance extended in the form of real property or to provide real 
property or structures on the property, the assurance will obligate the 
recipient or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for 
the period during which the real property or structures are used for the 
purpose for which Federal financial assistance is extended or for 
another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.
    (2) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide 
personal property, the assurance will obligate the recipient for the 
period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property.
    (3) In all other cases the assurance will obligate the recipient for 
the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.

[[Page 470]]

    (c) Covenants. (1) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in 
the form of real property or interest in the property from the 
Endowment, the instrument effecting or recording this transfer shall 
contain a covenant running with the land to assure nondiscrimination for 
the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for 
which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another 
purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.
    (2) Where no transfer of property is involved but property is 
purchased or improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient 
shall agree to include the covenant described in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section in the instrument effecting or recording any subsequent 
transfer of the property.
    (3) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of 
real property or interest in the property from the Endowment, the 
covenant shall also include a condition coupled with a right to be 
reserved by the Endowment to revert title to the property in the event 
of a breach of the covenant. If a transferee of real property proposes 
to mortgage or to otherwise encumber the real property as security for 
financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on 
the property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, 
the responsible Endowment official may, upon request of the transferee 
and if necessary to accomplish such financing and upon such conditions 
as he or she deems appropriate, agree to forbear the exercise of such 
right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other 
encumbrance remains effective.


<R05>
Sec. 1170.52  Remedial action, voluntary action, and self-evaluation.

    (a) Remedial action. (1) If the Chairman finds that a recipient has 
discriminated against persons on the basis of handicap in violation of 
section 504 or this part, the recipient shall take such remedial action 
as the Chairman deems necessary to overcome the effects of the 
discrimination.
    (2) Where a recipient is found to have discriminated against persons 
on the basis of handicap in violation of section 504 or this part and 
where another recipient exercises control over the recipient that has 
discriminated, the Chairman, where appropriate, may require either or 
both recipients to take remedial action.
    (3) The Chairman may, where necessary to overcome the effects of 
discrimination in violation of section 504 or this part, require a 
recipient to take remedial action:
    (i) With respect to handicapped persons who are no longer 
participants in the recipient's program but who were participants in the 
program when such discrimination occurred, or
    (ii) With respect to handicapped persons who would have been 
participants in the program had the discrimination not occurred.
    (b) Voluntary action. A recipient may take steps, in addition to any 
action that is required by this part, to overcome the effects of 
conditions that resulted in limited participation in the recipient's 
program or activity by qualified handicapped persons.
    (c) A recipient shall within one year of the effective date of this 
part:
    (1) Evaluate, with the assistance of interested persons, including 
handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, 
its current policies and practices and the effects thereof that do not 
or may not meet the requirements of this part;
    (2) Modify, after consultation with interested persons, including 
handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, 
any policies and practices that do not meet the requirements of this 
part;
    (3) Take, after consultation with interested persons, including 
handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, 
appropriate remedial steps to eliminate the effects of any 
discrimination that resulted from adherence to these policies and 
practices.
    (4) A recipient that employs fifteen or more persons shall maintain 
on file, make available for public inspection, and provide to the 
Endowment upon request, for at least three years following completion of 
the self-evaluation:
    (i) A list of the interested persons consulted;
    (ii) A description of areas examined and any problems identified; 
and

[[Page 471]]

    (iii) A description of any modifications made and of any remedial

fifteen or more persons shall designate at least one person to 
coordinate its efforts to comply with this part.
    (b) Adoption of grievance procedures. A recipient that employs 
fifteen or more persons shall adopt grievance procedures that 
incorporate appropriate due process standards and that provide for the 
prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action 
prohibited by this part. Such procedures need not be established with 
respect to complaints from applicants for employment or from applicants 
for admission to postsecondary educational institutions.


<R05>
Sec. 1170.54  Notice.

    (a) A recipient that employs fifteen or more persons shall take 
appropriate initial and continuing steps to notify participants,

it does not discriminate on the basis of handicap in violation of 
section 504 and this part. The notification shall state, where 
appropriate, that the recipient does not discriminate in admission or 
access to, or treatment or employment in, its programs and activities.

publication, and distribution of memoranda or other written 
communications.
    (b) If a recipient publishes or uses recruitment materials or 
publications containing general information that it makes available to 
participants, beneficiaries, applicants, or employees, it shall include 
in those materials or publications a statement of the policy described 
in paragraph (a) of this section. A recipient may meet the requirement 
of this paragraph either by including appropriate inserts in existing

Indian tribal governments.


<R05>
Sec. 1174.2  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart contains general rules pertaining to this part and 
procedures for control of exceptions from this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1174.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Accrued expenditures mean the charges incurred by the grantee during 
a given period requiring the provision of funds for: (1) Goods and other 
tangible property received; (2) services performed by employees, 
contractors, subgrantees, subcontractors, and other payees; and (3) 
other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current services 
or performance is required, such as annuities, insurance claims, and 
other benefit payments.
    Accrued income means the sum of: (1) Earnings during a given period 
from services performed by the grantee and goods and other tangible 
property delivered to purchasers, and (2) amounts becoming owed to the 
grantee for which no current services or performance is required by the 
grantee.
    Acquisition cost of an item of purchased equipment means the net 
invoice unit price of the property including the cost of modifications, 
attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the 
property usable for the purpose for which it was acquired. Other charges 
such as the cost of installation, transportation, taxes, duty or 
protective in-transit insurance, shall be included or excluded from the 
unit acquisition cost in accordance with the grantee's regular 
accounting practices.
    Administrative requirements mean those matters common to grants in 
general, such as financial management, kinds and frequency of reports, 
and retention of records. These are distinguished from programmatic 
requirements, which concern matters that can be treated only on a 
program-by-program or grant-by-grant basis, such as kinds of activities 
that can be supported by grants under a particular program.
    Awarding agency means (1) with respect to a grant, the Federal 
agency, and (2) with respect to a subgrant, the party that awarded the 
subgrant.
    Cash contributions means the grantee's cash outlay, including the 
outlay of money contributed to the grantee or subgrantee by other public 
agencies and institutions, and private organizations and individuals. 
When authorized by Federal legislation, Federal funds received from 
other assistance agreements may be considered as grantee or subgrantee 
cash contributions.
    Contract means (except as used in the definitions for grant and 
subgrant in this section and except where qualified by Federal) a 
procurement contract

[[Page 473]]

under a grant or subgrant, and means a procurement subcontract under a 
contract.
    Cost sharing or matching means the value of the third party in-kind 
contributions and the portion of the costs of a federally assisted 
project or program not borne by the Federal Government.
    Cost-type contract means a contract or subcontract under a grant in 
which the contractor or subcontractor is paid on the basis of the costs 
it incurs, with or without a fee.
    Equipment means tangible, nonexpendable, personal property having a 
useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or 
more per unit. A grantee may use its own definition of equipment 
provided that such definition would at least include all equipment 
defined above.
    Expenditure report means: (1) For nonconstruction grants, the SF-269 
``Financial Status Report'' (or other equivalent report); (2) for 
construction grants, the SF-271 ``Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement'' (or other equivalent report).
    Federally recognized Indian tribal government means the governing 
body or a governmental agency of any Indian tribe, band, nation, or 
other organized group or community (including any Native village as 
defined in section 3 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, 85 Stat 
688) certified by the Secretary of the Interior as eligible for the 
special programs and services provided by him through the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs.
    Government means a State or local government or a federally 
recognized Indian tribal government.
    Grant means an award of financial assistance, including cooperative 
agreements, in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, by the 
Federal Government to an eligible grantee. The term does not include 
technical assistance which provides services instead of money, or other 
assistance in the form of revenue sharing, loans, loan guarantees, 
interest subsidies, insurance, or direct appropriations. Also, the term 
does not include assistance, such as a fellowship or other lump sum 
award, which the grantee is not required to account for.
    Grantee means the government to which a grant is awarded and which 
is accountable for the use of the funds provided. The grantee is the 
entire legal entity even if only a particular component of the entity is 
designated in the grant award document.
    Local government means a county, municipality, city, town, township, 
local public authority (including any public and Indian housing agency 
under the United States Housing Act of 1937) school district, special 
district, intrastate district, council of governments (whether or not 
incorporated as a nonprofit corporation under state law), any other 
regional or interstate government entity, or any agency or 
instrumentality of a local government.
    Obligations means the amounts of orders placed, contracts and 
subgrants awarded, goods and services received, and similar transactions 
during a given period that will require payment by the grantee during 
the same or a future period.
    OMB means the United States Office of Management and Budget.
    Outlays (expenditures) mean charges made to the project or program. 
They may be reported on a cash or accrual basis. For reports prepared on 
a cash basis, outlays are the sum of actual cash disbursement for direct 
charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense incurred, 
the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the amount of cash 
advances and payments made to contractors and subgrantees. For reports 
prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, outlays are the sum of actual 
cash disbursements, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value 
of inkind contributions applied, and the new increase (or decrease) in 
the amounts owed by the grantee for goods and other property received, 
for services performed by employees, contractors, subgrantees, 
subcontractors, and other payees, and other amounts becoming owed under 
programs for which no current services or performance are required, such 
as annuities, insurance claims, and other benefit payments.
    Percentage of completion method refers to a system under which 
payments are made for construction work according to the percentage of 
completion of the

[[Page 474]]

work, rather than to the grantee's cost incurred.
    Prior approval means documentation evidencing consent prior to 
incurring specific cost.
    Real property means land, including land improvements, structures 
and appurtenances thereto, excluding movable machinery and equipment.
    Share, when referring to the awarding agency's portion of real 
property, equipment or supplies, means the same percentage as the 
awarding agency's portion of the acquiring party's total costs under the 
grant to which the acquisition costs under the grant to which the 
acquisition cost of the property was charged. Only costs are to be 
counted--not the value of third-party in-kind contributions.
    State means any of the several States of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or 
possession of the United States, or any agency or instrumentality of a 
State exclusive of local governments. The term does not include any 
public and Indian housing agency under United States Housing Act of 
1937.
    Subgrant means an award of financial assistance in the form of 
money, or property in lieu of money, made under a grant by a grantee to 
an eligible subgrantee. The term includes financial assistance when 
provided by contractual legal agreement, but does not include 
procurement purchases, nor does it include any form of assistance which 
is excluded from the definition of grant in this part.
    Subgrantee means the government or other legal entity to which a 
subgrant is awarded and which is accountable to the grantee for the use 
of the funds provided.
    Supplies means all tangible personal property other than equipment 
as defined in this part.
    Suspension means depending on the context, either (1) temporary 
withdrawal of the authority to obligate grant funds pending corrective 
action by the grantee or subgrantee or a decision to terminate the 
grant, or (2) an action taken by a suspending official in accordance 
with agency regulations implementing E.O. 12549 to immediately exclude a 
person from participating in grant transactions for a period, pending 
completion of an investigation and such legal or debarment proceedings 
as may ensue.
    Termination means permanent withdrawal of the authority to obligate 
previously-awarded grant funds before that authority would otherwise 
expire. It also means the voluntary relinquishment of that authority by 
the grantee or subgrantee. Termination does not include: (1) Withdrawal 
of funds awarded on the basis of the grantee's underestimate of the 
unobligated balance in a prior period; (2) withdrawal of the unobligated 
balance as of the expiration of a grant; (3) refusal to extend a grant 
or award additional funds, to make a competing or noncompeting 
continuation, renewal, extension, or supplemental award; or (4) voiding 
of a grant upon determination that the award was obtained fraudulently, 
or was otherwise illegal or invalid from inception.
    Terms of a grant or subgrant mean all requirements of the grant or 
subgrant, whether in statute, regulations, or the award document.
    Third party in-kind contributions mean property or services which 
benefit a federally assisted project or program and which are 
contributed by non-Federal third parties without charge to the grantee, 
or a cost-type contractor under the grant agreement.
    Unliquidated obligations for reports prepared on a cash basis mean 
the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee that has not been 
paid. For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, they 
represent the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee for which an 
outlay has not been recorded.
    Unobligated balance means the portion of the funds authorized by the 
Federal agency that has not been obligated by the grantee and is 
determined by deducting the cumulative obligations from the cumulative 
funds authorized.

<R04>
                    Subpart B--Pre-Award Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 1174.10  Forms for applying for grants.

    (a) Scope. (1) This section prescribes forms and instructions to be 
used by governmental organizations (except hospitals and institutions of 
higher education operated by a government) in applying for grants. This 
section is not applicable, however, to formula grant programs which do 
not require applicants to apply for funds on a project basis.
    (2) This section applies only to applications to Federal agencies 
for grants, and is not required to be applied by grantees in dealing 
with applicants for subgrants. However, grantees are encouraged to avoid 
more detailed or burdensome application requirements for subgrants.
    (b) Authorized forms and instructions for governmental 
organizations. (1) In applying for grants, applicants shall only use 
standard application forms or those prescribed by the granting agency 
with the approval of OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
    (2) Applicants are not required to submit more than the original and 
two copies of preapplications or applications.
    (3) Applicants must follow all applicable instructions that bear OMB 
clearance numbers. Federal agencies may specify and describe the 
programs, functions, or activities that will be used to plan, budget, 
and evaluate the work under a grant. Other supplementary instructions 
may be issued only with the approval of OMB to the extent required under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. For any standard form, except the 
SF-424 facesheet, Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the 
applicant to disregard any line item that is not needed.
    (4) When a grantee applies for additional funding (such as a 
continuation or supplemental award) or amends a previously submitted 
application, only the affected pages need be submitted. Previously 
submitted pages with information that is still current need not be 
resubmitted.


<R05>
Sec. 1174.11  State plans.

    (a) Scope. The statutes for some programs require States to submit 
plans before receiving grants. Under regulations implementing Executive 
Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' States 
are allowed to simplify, consolidate and substitute plans. This section 
contains additional provisions for plans that are subject to regulations 
implementing the Executive order.
    (b) Requirements. A State need meet only Federal administrative or 
programmatic requirements for a plan that are in statutes or codified 
regulations.
    (c) Assurances. In each plan the State will include an assurance 
that the State shall comply with all applicable Federal statutes and 
regulations in effect with respect to the periods for which it receives 
grant funding. For this assurance and other assurances required in the 
plan, the State may:
    (1) Cite by number the statutory or regulatory provisions requiring 
the assurances and affirm that it gives the assurances required by those 
provisions,
    (2) Repeat the assurance language in the statutes or regulations, or
    (3) Develop its own language to the extent permitted by law.
    (d) Amendments. A State will amend a plan whenever necessary to 
reflect: (1) New or revised Federal statutes or regulations or (2) a 
material change in any State law, organization, policy, or State agency 
operation. The State will obtain approval for the amendment and its 
effective date but need submit for approval only the amended portions of 
the plan.

Sec. 1174.12  Special grant or subgrant conditions for ``high-risk'' grantees.

    (a) A grantee or subgrantee may be considered ``high risk'' if an 
awarding agency determines that a grantee or subgrantee:
    (1) Has a history of unsatisfactory performance, or
    (2) Is not financially stable, or
    (3) Has a management system which does not meet the management 
standards set forth in this part, or
    (4) Has not conformed to terms and conditions of previous awards, or
    (5) Is otherwise not responsible; and if the awarding agency 
determines that an award will be made, special conditions and/or 
restrictions shall correspond to the high risk condition and shall be 
included in the award.
    (b) Special conditions or restrictions may include:
    (1) Payment on a reimbursement basis;
    (2) Withholding authority to proceed to the next phase until receipt 
of evidence of acceptable performance within a given funding period;
    (3) Requiring additional, more detailed financial reports;
    (4) Additional project monitoring;
    (5) Requiring the grante or subgrantee to obtain technical or 
management assistance; or
    (6) Establishing additional prior approvals.
    (c) If an awarding agency decides to impose such conditions, the 
awarding official will notify the grantee or subgrantee as early as 
possible, in writing, of:
    (1) The nature of the special conditions/restrictions;
    (2) The reason(s) for imposing them;
    (3) The corrective actions which must be taken before they will be 
removed and the time allowed for completing the corrective actions and
    (4) The method of requesting reconsideration of the conditions/
restrictions imposed.

                   Subpart C--Post-Award Requirements

                        Financial Administration


<R05>
Sec. 1174.20  Standards for financial management systems.

    (a) A State must expand and account for grant funds in accordance 
with State laws and procedures for expending and accounting for its own 
funds. Fiscal control and accounting procedures of the State, as well as 
its subgrantees and cost-type contractors, must be sufficient to--
    (1) Permit preparation of reports required by this part and the 
statutes authorizing the grant, and
    (2) Permit the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate 
to establish that such funds have not been used in violation of the 
restrictions and prohibitions of applicable statutes.
    (b) The financial management systems of other grantees and 
subgrantees must meet the following standards:
    (1) Financial reporting. Accurate, current, and complete disclosure 
of the financial results of financially assisted activities must be made 
in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the grant or 
subgrant.
    (2) Accounting records. Grantees and subgrantees must maintain 
records which adequately identify the source and application of funds 
provided for financially-assisted activities. These records must contain 
information pertaining to grant or subgrant awards and authorizations, 
obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays or 
expenditures, and income.
    (3) Internal control. Effective control and accountability must be 
maintained for all grant and subgrant cash, real and personal property, 
and other assets. Grantees and subgrantees must adequately safeguard all 
such property and must assure that it is used solely for authorized 
purposes.
    (4) Budget control. Actual expenditures or outlays must be compared 
with budgeted amounts for each grant or subgrant. Financial information

[[Page 478]]

must be related to performance or productivity data, including the 
development of unit cost information whenever appropriate or 
specifically required in the grant or subgrant agreement. If unit cost 
data are required, estimates based on available documentation will be 
accepted whenever possible.
    (5) Allowable cost. Applicable OMB cost principles, agency program 
regulations, and the terms of grant and subgrant agreements will be 
followed in determining the reasonableness, allowability, and 
allocability of costs.
    (6) Source documentation. Accounting records must be supported by 
such source documentation as cancelled checks, paid bills, payrolls, 
time and attendance records, contract and subgrant award documents, etc.
    (7) Cash management. Procedures for minimizing the time elapsing 
between the transfer of funds from the U.S. Treasury and disbursement by 
grantees and subgrantees must be followed whenever advance payment 
procedures are used. Grantees must establish reasonable procedures to 
ensure the receipt of reports on subgrantees' cash balances and cash 
disbursements in sufficient time to enable them to prepare complete and 
accurate cash transactions reports to the awarding agency. When advances 
are made by letter-of-credit or electronic transfer of funds methods, 
the grantee must make drawdowns as close as possible to the time of 
making disbursements. Grantees must monitor cash drawdowns by their 
subgrantees to assure that they conform substantially to the same 
standards of timing and amount as apply to advances to the grantees.
    (c) An awarding agency may review the adequacy of the financial 
management system of any applicant for financial assistance as part of a 
preaward review or at any time subsequent to award.


<R05>
Sec. 1174.21  Payment.

    (a) Scope. This section prescribes the basic standard and the 
methods under which a Federal agency will make payments to grantees, and 
grantees will make payments to subgrantees and contractors.
    (b) Basic standard. Methods and procedures for payment shall 
minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and 
disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee, in accordance with Treasury 
regulations at 31 CFR Part 205.
    (c) Advances. Grantees and subgrantees shall be paid in advance, 
provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness and ability to 
maintain procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer 
of the funds and their disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee.
    (d) Reimbursement. Reimbursement shall be the preferred method when 
the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section are not met. Grantees 
and subgrantees may also be paid by reimbursement for any construction 
grant. Except as otherwise specified in regulation, Federal agencies 
shall not use the percentage of completion method to pay construction 
grants. The grantee or subgrantee may use that method to pay its 
construction contractor, and if it does, the awarding agency's payments 
to the grantee or subgrantee will be based on the grantee's or 
subgrantee's actual rate of disbursement.
    (e) Working capital advances. If a grantee cannot meet the criteria 
for advance payments described in paragraph (c) of this section, and the 
Federal agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because 
the grantee lacks sufficient working capital, the awarding agency may 
provide cash or a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure 
the awarding agency shall advance cash to the grantee to cover its 
estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to 
the grantee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the awarding agency shall 
reimburse the grantee for its actual cash disbursements. The working 
capital advance method of payment shall not be used by grantees or 
subgrantees if the reason for using such method is the unwillingness or 
inability of the grantee to provide timely advances to the subgrantee to 
meet the subgrantee's actual cash disbursements.
    (f) Effect of program income, refunds, and audit recoveries on 
payment. (1)

[[Page 479]]

Grantees and subgrantees shall disburse repayments to and interest 
earned on a revolving fund before requesting additional cash payments 
for the same activity.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, grantees 
and subgrantees shall disburse program income, rebates, refunds, 
contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds 
before requesting additional cash payments.
    (g) Withholding payments. (1) Unless otherwise required by Federal 
statute, awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper 
charges incurred by grantees or subgrantees unless--
    (i) The grantee or subgrantee has failed to comply with grant award 
conditions or
    (ii) The grantee or subgrantee is indebted to the United States.
    (2) Cash withheld for failure to comply with grant award condition, 
but without suspension of the grant, shall be released to the grantee 
upon subsequent compliance. When a grant is suspended, payment 
adjustments will be made in accordance with Sec. 1174.43(c).
    (3) A Federal agency shall not make payment to grantees for amounts 
that are withheld by grantees or subgrantees from payment to contractors 
to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payments shall be made by the 
Federal agency when the grantees or subgrantees actually disburse the 
withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to 
assure satisfactory completion of work.
    (h) Cash depositories. (1) Consistent with the national goal of 
expanding the opportunities for minority business enterprises, grantees 
and subgrantees are encouraged to use minority banks (a bank which is 
owned at least 50 percent by minority group members). A list of minority 
owned banks can be obtained from the Minority Business Development 
Agency, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230.
    (2) A grantee or subgrantee shall maintain a separate bank account 
only when required by Federal-State agreement.
    (i) Interest earned on advances. Except for interest earned on 
advances of funds exempt under the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 
U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) and the Indian Self-Determination Act (23 U.S.C. 
450), grantees and subgrantees shall promptly, but at least quarterly, 
remit interest earned on advances to the Federal agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee may keep interest amounts up to $100 per year for 
administrative expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 1174.22  Allowable costs.

    (a) Limitation on use of funds. Grant funds may be used only for:
    (1) The allowable costs of the grantees, subgrantees and cost-type 
contractors, including allowable costs in the form of payments to fixed-
price contractors; and
    (2) Reasonable fees or profit to cost-type contractors but not any 
fee or profit (or other increment above allowable costs) to the grantee 
or subgrantee.
    (b) Applicable cost principles. For each kind of organization, there 
is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. 
Allowable costs will be determined in accordance with the cost 
principles applicable to the organization incurring the costs. The 
following chart lists the kinds of organizations and the applicable cost 
principles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 1174.23  Period of availability of funds.

    (a) General. Where a funding period is specified, a grantee may 
charge to the award only costs resulting from obligations of the funding 
period unless carryover of unobligated balances is permitted, in which 
case the carryover balances may be charged for costs resulting from 
obligations of the subsequent funding period.

[[Page 480]]

    (b) Liquidation of obligations. A grantee must liquidate all 
obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 days after the 
end of the funding period (or as specified in a program regulation) to 
coincide with the submission of the annual Financial Status Report (SF-
269). The Federal agency may extend this deadline at the request of the 
grantee.


<R05>
Sec. 1174.24  Matching or cost sharing.

    (a) Basic rule: Costs and contributions acceptable. With the 
qualifications and exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, a 
matching or cost sharing requirement may be satisfied by either or both 
of the following:
    (1) Allowable costs incurred by the grantee, subgrantee or a cost-
type contractor under the assistance agreement. This includes allowable 
costs borne by non-Federal grants or by others cash donations from non-
Federal third parties.
    (2) The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to the 
period to which the cost sharing or matching requirements applies.
    (b) Qualifications and exceptions--(1) Costs borne by other Federal 
grant agreements. Except as provided by Federal statute, a cost sharing 
or matching requirement may not be met by costs borne by another Federal 
grant. This prohibition does not apply to income earned by a grantee or 
subgrantee from a contract awarded under another Federal grant.
    (2) General revenue sharing. For the purpose of this section, 
general revenue sharing funds distributed under 31 U.S.C. 6702 are not 
considered Federal grant funds.
    (3) Cost or contributions counted towards other Federal costs-
sharing requirements. Neither costs nor the values of third party in-
kind contributions may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or 
matching requirement of a grant agreement if they have been or will be 
counted towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of 
another Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement contract, or any 
other award of Federal funds.
    (4) Costs financed by program income. Costs financed by program 
income, as defined in Sec. 1174.25, shall not count towards satisfying a 
cost sharing or matching requirement unless they are expressly permitted 
in the terms of the assistance agreement. (This use of general program 
income is described in Sec. 1174.25(g).)
    (5) Services or property financed by income earned by contractors. 
Contractors under a grant may earn income from the activities carried 
out under the contract in addition to the amounts earned from the party 
awarding the contract. No costs of services or property supported by 
this income may count toward satisfying a cost sharing or matching 
requirement unless other provisions of the grant agreement expressly 
permit this kind of income to be used to meet the requirement.
    (6) Records. Costs and third party in-kind contributions counting 
towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement must be 
verifiable from the records of grantees and subgrantee or cost-type 
contractors. These records must show how the value placed on third party 
in-kind contributions was derived. To the extent feasible, volunteer 
services will be supported by the same methods that the organization 
uses to support the allocability of regular personnel costs.
    (7) Special standards for third party in-kind contributions. (i) 
Third party in-kind contributions count towards satisfying a cost 
sharing or matching requirement only where, if the party receiving the 
contributions were to pay for them, the payments would be allowable 
costs.
    (ii) Some third party in-kind contributions are goods and services 
that, if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor receiving the 
contribution had to pay for them, the payments would have been an 
indirect costs. Costs sharing or matching credit for such contributions 
shall be given only if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor has 
established, along with its regular indirect cost rate, a special rate 
for allocating to individual projects or programs the value of the 
contributions.
    (iii) A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed-price contract 
may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only 
if it results in:

[[Page 481]]

    (A) An increase in the services or property provided under the 
contract (without additional cost to the grantee or subgrantee) or
    (B) A cost savings to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (iv) The values placed on third party in-kind contributions for cost 
sharing or matching purposes will conform to the rules in the succeeding 
sections of this part. If a third party in-kind contribution is a type 
not treated in those sections, the value placed upon it shall be fair 
and reasonable.
    (c) Valuation of donated services--(1) Volunteer services. Unpaid 
services provided to a grantee or subgrantee by individuals will be 
valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work 
in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. If the grantee or 
subgrantee does not have employees performing similar work, the rates 
will be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for 
similar work in the same labor market. In either case, a reasonable 
amount for fringe benefits may be included in the valuation.
    (2) Employees of other organizations. When an employer other than a 
grantee, subgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge 
the services of an employee in the employee's normal line of work, the 
services will be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive 
of the employee's fringe benefits and overhead costs. If the services 
are in a different line of work, paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
applies.
    (d) Valuation of third party donated supplies and loaned equipment 
or space. (1) If a third party donates supplies, the contribution will 
be valued at the market value of the supplies at the time of donation.
    (2) If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a 
building but retains title, the contribution will be valued at the fair 
rental rate of the equipment or space.
    (e) Valuation of third party donated equipment, buildings, and land. 
If a third party donates equipment, buildings, or land, and title passes 
to a grantee or subgrantee, the treatment of the donated property will 
depend upon the purpose of the grant or subgrant, as follows:
    (1) Awards for capital expenditures. If the purpose of the grant or 
subgrant is to assist the grantee or subgrantee in the acquisition of 
property, the market value of that property at the time of donation may 
be counted as cost sharing or matching,
    (2) Other awards. If assisting in the acquisition of property is not 
the purpose of the grant or subgrant, paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of 
this section apply:
    (i) If approval is obtained from the awarding agency, the market 
value at the time of donation of the donated equipment or buildings and 
the fair rental rate of the donated land may be counted as cost sharing 
or matching. In the case of a subgrant, the terms of the grant agreement 
may require that the approval be obtained from the Federal agency as 
well as the grantee. In all cases, the approval may be given only if a 
purchase of the equipment or rental of the land would be approved as an 
allowable direct cost. If any part of the donated property was acquired 
with Federal funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be 
counted as cost-sharing or matching.
    (ii) If approval is not obtained under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this 
section, no amount may be counted for donated land, and only 
depreciation or use allowances may be counted for donated equipment and 
buildings. The depreciation or use allowances for this property are not 
treated as third party in-kind contributions. Instead, they are treated 
as costs incurred by the grantee or subgrantee. They are computed and 
allocated (usually as indirect costs) in accordance with the cost 
principles specified in Sec. 1174.22, in the same way as depreciation or 
use allowances for purchased equipment and buildings. The amount of 
depreciation or use allowances for donated equipment and buildings is 
based on the property's market value at the time it was donated.
    (f) Valuation of grantee or subgrantee donated real property for 
construction/acquisition. If a grantee or subgrantee donates real 
property for a construction or facilities acquisition project, the 
current market value of that property may be counted as cost sharing or 
matching. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal

[[Page 482]]

funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be counted as cost 
sharing or matching.
    (g) Appraisal of real property. In some cases under paragraphs (d), 
(e) and (f) of this section, it will be necessary to establish the 
market value of land or a building or the fair rental rate of land or of 
space in a building. In these cases, the Federal agency may require the 
market value or fair rental value be set by an independent appraiser, 
and that the value or rate be certified by the grantee. This requirement 
will also be imposed by the grantee on subgrantees.


<R05>
Sec. 1174.25  Program income.

    (a) General. Grantees are encouraged to earn income to defray 
program costs. Program income includes income from fees for services 
performed, from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired 
with grant funds, from the sale of commodities or items fabricated under 
a grant agreement, and from payments of principal and interest on loans 
made with grant funds. Except as otherwise provided in regulations of 
the Federal agency, program income does not include interest on grant 
funds, rebates, credits, discounts, refunds, etc. and interest earned on 
any of them.
    (b) Definition of program income. Program income means gross income 
received by the grantee or subgrantee directly generated by a grant 
supported activity, or earned only as a result of the grant agreement 
during the grant period. ``During the grant period'' is the time between 
the effective date of the award and the ending date of the award 
reflected in the final financial report.
    (c) Cost of generating program income. If authorized by Federal 
regulations or the grant agreement, costs incident to the generation of 
program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program 
income.
    (d) Governmental revenues. Taxes, special assessments, levies, 
fines, and other such revenues raised by a grantee or subgrantee are not 
program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the 
grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income.
    (e) Royalties. Income from royalties and license fees for 
copyrighted material, patents, and inventions developed by a grantee or 
subgrantee is program income only if the revenues are specifically 
identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as 
program income. (See Sec. 1174.34.)
    (f) Property. Proceeds from the sale of real property or equipment 
will be handled in accordance with the requirements of Secs. 1174.31 and 
1174.32.
    (g) Use of program income. Program income shall be deducted from 
outlays which may be both Federal and non-Federal as described below, 
unless the Federal agency regulations or the grant agreement specify 
another alternative (or a combination of the alternatives). In 
specifying alternatives, the Federal agency may distinguish between 
income earned by the grantee and income earned by subgrantees and 
between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income. When Federal agencies 
authorize the alternatives in paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) of this 
section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall also be 
deducted from outlays.
    (1) Deduction. Ordinarily program income shall be deducted from 
total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program 
income shall be used for current costs unless the Federal agency 
authorizes otherwise. Program income which the grantee did not 
anticipate at the time of the award shall be used to reduce the Federal 
agency and grantee contributions rather than to increase the funds 
committed to the project.
    (2) Addition. When authorized, program income may be added to the 
funds committed to the grant agreement by the Federal agency and the 
grantee. The program income shall be used for the purposes and under the 
conditions of the grant agreement.
    (3) Cost sharing or matching. When authorized, program income may be 
used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the grant 
agreement. The amount of the Federal grant award remains the same.
    (h) Income after the award period. There are no Federal requirements 
governing the disposition of program income earned after the end of the 
award

[[Page 483]]

period (i.e., until the ending date of the final financial report, see 
paragraph (a) of this section), unless the terms of the agreement or the 
Federal agency regulations provide otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 1174.26  Non-Federal audit.

    (a) Basic rule. Grantees and subgrantees are responsible for 
obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 
1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits of 
States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.'' The audits 
shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance with generally 
accepted government auditing standards covering financial audits.
    (b) Subgrantees. State or local governments, as those terms are 
defined for purposes of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, that 
provide Federal awards to a subgrantee, which expends $300,000 or more 
(or other amount as specified by OMB) in Federal awards in a fiscal 
year, shall:
    (1) Determine whether State or local subgrantees have met the audit 
requirements of the Act and whether subgrantees covered by OMB Circular 
A-110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements 
with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit 
Organizations,'' have met the audit requirements of the Act. Commercial 
contractors (private for-profit and private and governmental 
organizations) providing goods and services to State and local 
governments are not required to have a single audit performed. State and 
local governments should use their own procedures to ensure that the 
contractor has complied with laws and regulations affecting the 
expenditure of Federal funds;
    (2) Determine whether the subgrantee spent Federal assistance funds 
provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be 
accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subgrantee made in accordance 
with the Act, Circular A-110, or through other means (e.g., program 
reviews) if the subgrantee has not had such an audit;
    (3) Ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken within six 
months after receipt of the audit report in instance of noncompliance 
with Federal laws and regulations;
    (4) Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate adjustment of the 
grantee's own records; and
    (5) Require each subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have 
access to the records and financial statements.
    (c) Auditor selection. In arranging for audit services, Sec. 1174.36 
shall be followed.

[53 FR 8082, 8087, Mar. 11, 1988, as amended at 62 FR 45939, 45946, Aug. 
29, 1997]

                    Changes, Property, and Subawards


<R05>
Sec. 1174.30  Changes.

    (a) General. Grantees and subgrantees are permitted to rebudget 
within the approved direct cost budget to meet unanticipated 
requirements and may make limited program changes to the approved 
project. However, unless waived by the awarding agency, certain types of 
post-award changes in budgets and projects shall require the prior 
written approval of the awarding agency.
    (b) Relation to cost principles. The applicable cost principles (see 
Sec. 1174.22) contain requirements for prior approval of certain types 
of costs. Except where waived, those requirements apply to all grants 
and subgrants even if paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section do not.
    (c) Budget changes--(1) Nonconstruction projects. Except as stated 
in other regulations or an award document, grantees or subgrantees shall 
obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the 
following changes is anticipated under a nonconstruction award:
    (i) Any revision which would result in the need for additional 
funding.
    (ii) Unless waived by the awarding agency, cumulative transfers 
among direct cost categories, or, if applicable, among separately 
budgeted programs, projects, functions, or activities which exceed or 
are expected to exceed ten percent of the current total approved budget, 
whenever the awarding agency's share exceeds $100,000.
    (iii) Transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (i.e., from 
direct

[[Page 484]]

payments to trainees to other expense categories).
    (2) Construction projects. Grantees and subgrantees shall obtain 
prior written approval for any budget revision which would result in the 
need for additional funds.
    (3) Combined construction and nonconstruction projects. When a grant 
or subgrant provides funding for both construction and nonconstruction 
activities, the grantee or subgrantee must obtain prior written approval 
from the awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfer from 
nonconstruction to construction or vice versa.
    (d) Programmatic changes. Grantees or subgrantees must obtain the 
prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following 
actions is anticipated:
    (1) Any revision of the scope or objectives of the project 
(regardless of whether there is an associated budget revision requiring 
prior approval).
    (2) Need to extend the period of availability of funds.
    (3) Changes in key persons in cases where specified in an 
application or a grant award. In research projects, a change in the 
project director or principal investigator shall always require approval 
unless waived by the awarding agency.
    (4) Under nonconstruction projects, contracting out, subgranting (if 
authorized by law) or otherwise obtaining the services of a third party 
to perform activities which are central to the purposes of the award. 
This approval requirement is in addition to the approval requirements of 
Sec. 1174.36 but does not apply to the procurement of equipment, 
supplies, and general support services.
    (e) Additional prior approval requirements. The awarding agency may 
not require prior approval for any budget revision which is not 
described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) Requesting prior approval. (1) A request for prior approval of 
any budget revision will be in the same budget formal the grantee used 
in its application and shall be accompanied by a narrative justification 
for the proposed revision.
    (2) A request for a prior approval under the applicable Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 1174.22) may be made by letter.
    (3) A request by a subgrantee for prior approval will be addressed 
in writing to the grantee. The grantee will promptly review such request 
and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing. A grantee will 
not approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent with 
the purpose or terms and conditions of the Federal grant to the grantee. 
If the revision, requested by the subgrantee would result in a change to 
the grantee's approved project which requires Federal prior approval, 
the grantee will obtain the Federal agency's approval before approving 
the subgrantee's request.

Sec. 1174.31  Real property.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to real property acquired under a grant or subgrant 
will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Use. Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes, real 
property will be used for the originally authorized purposes as long as 
needed for that purposes, and the grantee or subgrantee shall not 
dispose of or encumber its title or other interests.
    (c) Disposition. When real property is no longer needed for the 
originally authorized purpose, the grantee or subgrantee will request 
disposition instructions from the awarding agency. The instructions will 
provide for one of the following alternatives:
    (1) Retention of title. Retain title after compensating the awarding 
agency. The amount paid to the awarding agency will be computed by 
applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost 
of the original purchase to the fair market value of the property. 
However, in those situations where a grantee or subgrantee is disposing 
of real property acquired with grant funds and acquiring replacement 
real property under the same program, the net proceeds from the 
disposition may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement 
property.
    (2) Sale of property. Sell the property and compensate the awarding 
agency.

[[Page 485]]

The amount due to the awarding agency will be calculated by applying the 
awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the 
original purchase to the proceeds of the sale after deduction of any 
actual and reasonable selling and fixing-up expenses. If the grant is 
still active, the net proceeds from sale may be offset against the 
original cost of the property. When a grantee or subgrantee is directed 
to sell property, sales procedures shall be followed that provide for 
competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible 
return.
    (3) Transfer of title. Transfer title to the awarding agency or to a 
third-party designated/approved by the awarding agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the grantee or 
subgrantee's percentage of participation in the purchase of the real 
property to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 1174.32  Equipment.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) States. A State will use, manage, and dispose of equipment 
acquired under a grant by the State in accordance with State laws and 
procedures. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (c) 
through (e) of this section.
    (c) Use. (1) Equipment shall be used by the grantee or subgrantee in 
the program or project for which it was acquired as long as needed, 
whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by 
Federal funds. When no longer needed for the original program or 
project, the equipment may be used in other activities currently or 
previously supported by a Federal agency.
    (2) The grantee or subgrantee shall also make equipment available 
for use on other projects or programs currently or previously supported 
by the Federal Government, providing such use will not interfere with 
the work on the projects or program for which it was originally 
acquired. First preference for other use shall be given to other 
programs or projects supported by the awarding agency. User fees should 
be considered if appropriate.
    (3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in Sec. 1174.25(a) to earn 
program income, the grantee or subgrantee must not use equipment 
acquired with grant funds to provide services for a fee to compete 
unfairly with private companies that provide equivalent services, unless 
specifically permitted or contemplated by Federal statute.
    (4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the grantee or subgrantee 
may use the equipment to be replaced as a trade-in or sell the property 
and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement property, 
subject to the approval of the awarding agency.
    (d) Management requirements. Procedures for managing equipment 
(including replacement equipment), whether acquired in whole or in part 
with grant funds, until disposition takes place will, as a minimum, meet 
the following requirements:
    (1) Property records must be maintained that include a description 
of the property, a serial number or other identification number, the 
source of property, who holds title, the acquisition date, and cost of 
the property, percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the 
property, the location, use and condition of the property, and any 
ultimate disposition data including the date of disposal and sale price 
of the property.
    (2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken and the 
results reconciled with the property records at least once every two 
years.
    (3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards 
to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property. Any loss, damage, or 
theft shall be investigated.
    (4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the 
property in good condition.
    (5) If the grantee or subgrantee is authorized or required to sell 
the property, proper sales procedures must be established to ensure the 
highest possible return.
    (e) Disposition. When original or replacement equipment acquired 
under a grant or subgrant is no longer needed

[[Page 486]]

for the original project or program or for other activities currently or 
previously supported by a Federal agency, disposition of the equipment 
will be made as follows:
    (1) Items of equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of 
less than $5,000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no 
further obligation to the awarding agency.
    (2) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value in 
excess of $5,000 may be retained or sold and the awarding agency shall 
have a right to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market 
value or proceeds from sale by the awarding agency's share of the 
equipment.
    (3) In cases where a grantee or subgrantee fails to take appropriate 
disposition actions, the awarding agency may direct the grantee or 
subgrantee to take excess and disposition actions.
    (f) Federal equipment. In the event a grantee or subgrantee is 
provided federally-owned equipment:
    (1) Title will remain vested in the Federal Government.
    (2) Grantees or subgrantees will manage the equipment in accordance 
with Federal agency rules and procedures, and submit an annual inventory 
listing.
    (3) When the equipment is no longer needed, the grantee or 
subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the Federal 
agency.
    (g) Right to transfer title. The Federal awarding agency may reserve 
the right to transfer title to the Federal Government or a third part 
named by the awarding agency when such a third party is otherwise 
eligible under existing statutes. Such transfers shall be subject to the 
following standards:
    (1) The property shall be identified in the grant or otherwise made 
known to the grantee in writing.
    (2) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instruction 
within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the 
project for which it was acquired. If the Federal awarding agency fails 
to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar-day period the 
grantee shall follow Sec. 1174.32(e).
    (3) When title to equipment is transferred, the grantee shall be 
paid an amount calculated by applying the percentage of participation in 
the purchase to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 1174.33  Supplies.

    (a) Title. Title to supplies acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest, upon acquisition, in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Disposition. If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies 
exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate fair market value upon termination 
or completion of the award, and if the supplies are not needed for any 
other federally sponsored programs or projects, the grantee or 
subgrantee shall compensate the awarding agency for its share.


<R05>
Sec. 1174.34  Copyrights.

    The Federal awarding agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, 
and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish or otherwise use, and to 
authorize others to use, for Federal Government purposes:
    (a) The copyright in any work developed under a grant, subgrant, or 
contract under a grant or subgrant; and
    (b) Any rights of copyright to which a grantee, subgrantee or a 
contractor purchases ownership with grant support.


<R05>
Sec. 1174.35  Subawards to debarred and suspended parties.

    Grantees and subgrantees must not make any award or permit any award 
(subgrant or contract) at any tier to any party which is debarred or 
suspended or is otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation 
in Federal assistance programs under Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment 
and Suspension.''


<R05>
Sec. 1174.36  Procurement.

    (a) States. When procuring property and services under a grant, a 
State will follow the same policies and procedures it uses for 
procurements from its non-Federal funds. The State will ensure that 
every purchase order or other contract includes any clauses required by 
Federal statutes and executive orders and their implementing 
regulations. Other grantees and subgrantees will

[[Page 487]]

follow paragraphs (b) through (i) in this section.
    (b) Procurement standards. (1) Grantees and subgrantees will use 
their own procurement procedures which reflect applicable State and 
local laws and regulations, provided that the procurements conform to 
applicable Federal law and the standards identified in this section.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a contract administration 
system which ensures that contractors perform in accordance with the 
terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase 
orders.
    (3) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a written code of 
standards of conduct governing the performance of their employees 
engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, 
officer or agent of the grantee or subgrantee shall participate in 
selection, or in the award or administration of a contract supported by 
Federal funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be 
involved. Such a conflict would arise when:
    (i) The employee, officer or agent,
    (ii) Any member of his immediate family,
    (iii) His or her partner, or
    (iv) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of 
the above, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for 
award. The grantee's or subgrantee's officers, employees or agents will 
neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary 
value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to 
subagreements. Grantee and subgrantees may set minimum rules where the 
financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item 
of nominal intrinsic value. To the extent permitted by State or local 
law or regulations, such standards or conduct will provide for 
penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of 
such standards by the grantee's and subgrantee's officers, employees, or 
agents, or by contractors or their agents. The awarding agency may in 
regulation provide additional prohibitions relative to real, apparent, 
or potential conflicts of interest.
    (4) Grantee and subgrantee procedures will provide for a review of 
proposed procurements to avoid purchase of unnecessary or duplicative 
items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out 
procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an 
analysis will be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any 
other appropriate analysis to determine the most economical approach.
    (5) To foster greater economy and efficiency, grantees and 
subgrantees are encouraged to enter into State and local 
intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common goods and 
services.
    (6) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use Federal excess 
and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property 
whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs.
    (7) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use value engineering 
clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to 
offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is 
a systematic and creative anaylsis of each contract item or task to 
ensure that its essential function is provided at the overall lower 
cost.
    (8) Grantees and subgrantees will make awards only to responsible 
contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the 
terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be 
given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public 
policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical 
resources.
    (9) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain records sufficient to 
detail the significant history of a procurement. These records will 
include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: rationale for 
the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor 
selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.
    (10) Grantees and subgrantees will use time and material type 
contracts only--
    (i) After a determination that no other contract is suitable, and
    (ii) If the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor 
exceeds at its own risk.

[[Page 488]]

    (11) Grantees and subgrantees alone will be responsible, in 
accordance with good administrative practice and sound business 
judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative 
issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not 
limited to source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. These 
standards do not relieve the grantee or subgrantee of any contractual 
responsibilities under its contracts. Federal agencies will not 
substitute their judgment for that of the grantee or subgrantee unless 
the matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be 
referred to the local, State, or Federal authority having proper 
jurisdiction.
    (12) Grantees and subgrantees will have protest procedures to handle 
and resolve disputes relating to their procurements and shall in all 
instances disclose information regarding the protest to the awarding 
agency. A protestor must exhaust all administrative remedies with the 
grantee and subgrantee before pursuing a protest with the Federal 
agency. Reviews of protests by the Federal agency will be limited to:
    (i) Violations of Federal law or regulations and the standards of 
this section (violations of State or local law will be under the 
jurisdiction of State or local authorities) and
    (ii) Violations of the grantee's or subgrantee's protest procedures 
for failure to review a complaint or protest. Protests received by the 
Federal agency other than those specified above will be referred to the 
grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Competition. (1) All procurement transactions will be conducted 
in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with the 
standards of Sec. 1174.36. Some of the situations considered to be 
restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:
    (i) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to 
qualify to do business,
    (ii) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding,
    (iii) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between 
affiliated companies,
    (iv) Noncompetitive awards to consultants that are on retainer 
contracts,
    (v) Organizational conflicts of interest,
    (vi) Specifying only a ``brand name'' product instead of allowing 
``an equal'' product to be offered and describing the performance of 
other relevant requirements of the procurement, and
    (vii) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will conduct procurements in a manner 
that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-
State or local geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or 
proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes 
expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing in this 
section preempts State licensing laws. When contracting for 
architectural and engineering (A/E) services, geographic location may be 
a selection criteria provided its application leaves an appropriate 
number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to 
compete for the contract.
    (3) Grantees will have written selection procedures for procurement 
transactions. These procedures will ensure that all solicitations:
    (i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical 
requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such 
description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features 
which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a 
statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service 
to be procured, and when necessary, shall set forth those minimum 
essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it 
is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should 
be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to 
make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a 
``brand name or equal'' description may be used as a means to define the 
performance or other salient requirements of a procurement. The specific 
features of the named brand which must be met by offerors shall be 
clearly stated; and
    (ii) Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and 
all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

[[Page 489]]

    (4) Grantees and subgrantees will ensure that all prequalified lists 
of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and 
services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure 
maximum open and free competition. Also, grantees and subgrantees will 
not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation 
period.
    (d) Methods of procurement to be followed--(1) Procurement by small 
purchase procedures. Small purchase procedures are those relatively 
simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, 
or other property that do not cost more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently set at $100,000). If 
small purchase procedures are used, price or rate quotations shall be 
obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.
    (2) Procurement by sealed bids (formal advertising). Bids are 
publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit 
price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with 
all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the 
lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for 
procuring construction, if the conditions in Sec. 1174.36(d)(2)(i) 
apply.
    (i) In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following 
conditions should be present:
    (A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase 
description is available;
    (B) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete 
effectively and for the business; and
    (C) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and 
the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the 
basis of price.
    (ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:
    (A) The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids 
shall be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing 
them sufficient time prior to the date set for opening the bids;
    (B) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications 
and pertinent attachments, shall define the items or services in order 
for the bidder to properly respond;
    (C) All bids will be publicly opened at the time and place 
prescribed in the invitation for bids;
    (D) A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing to the 
lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding 
documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life 
cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is lowest. 
Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior 
experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; 
and
    (E) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented 
reason.
    (3) Procurement by competitive proposals. The technique of 
competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source 
submitting an offer, and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type 
contract is awarded. It is generally used when conditions are not 
appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the 
following requirements apply:
    (i) Requests for proposals will be publicized and identify all 
evaluation factors and their relative importance. Any response to 
publicized requests for proposals shall be honored to the maximum extent 
practical;
    (ii) Proposals will be solicited from an adequate number of 
qualified sources;
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees will have a method for conducting 
technical evaluations of the proposals received and for selecting 
awardees;
    (iv) Awards will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is 
most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors 
considered; and
    (v) Grantees and subgrantees may use competitive proposal procedures 
for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) 
professional services whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated 
and the most qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of 
fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as 
a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional 
services. It cannot be used to purchase other types

[[Page 490]]

of services though A/E firms are a potential source to perform the 
proposed effort.
    (4) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals is procurement through 
solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or after solicitation 
of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.
    (i) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used only when 
the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase procedures, 
sealed bids or competitive proposals and one of the following 
circumstances applies:
    (A) The item is available only from a single source;
    (B) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not 
permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation;
    (C) The awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive proposals; or
    (D) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is 
determined inadequate.
    (ii) Cost analysis, i.e., verifying the proposed cost data, the 
projections of the data, and the evaluation of the specific elements of 
costs and profits, is required.
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees may be required to submit the 
proposed procurement to the awarding agency for pre-award review in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (e) Contracting with small and minority firms, women's business 
enterprise and labor surplus area firms. (1) The grantee and subgrantee 
will take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority firms, 
women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when 
possible.
    (2) Affirmative steps shall include:
    (i) Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women's 
business enterprises on solicitation lists;
    (ii) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women's 
business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources;
    (iii) Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into 
smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small and 
minority business, and women's business enterprises;
    (iv) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, 
which encourage participation by small and minority business, and 
women's business enterprises;
    (v) Using the services and assistance of the Small Business 
Administration, and the Minority Business Development Agency of the 
Department of Commerce; and
    (vi) Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, 
to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through 
(v) of this section.
    (f) Contract cost and price. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must 
perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement 
action including contract modifications. The method and degree of 
analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular 
procurement situation, but as a starting point, grantees must make 
independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. A cost 
analysis must be performed when the offeror is required to submit the 
elements of his estimated cost, e.g., under professional, consulting, 
and architectural engineering services contracts. A cost analysis will 
be necessary when adequate price competition is lacking, and for sole 
source procurements, including contract modifications or change orders, 
unless price resonableness can be established on the basis of a catalog 
or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities 
to the general public or based on prices set by law or regulation. A 
price analysis will be used in all other instances to determine the 
reasonableness of the proposed contract price.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will negotiate profit as a separate 
element of the price for each contract in which there is no price 
competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To 
establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration will be given to 
the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the 
contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, 
the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates 
in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.

[[Page 491]]

    (3) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under 
grants will be allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost 
estimates included in negotiated prices are consistent with Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 1174.22). Grantees may reference their own cost 
principles that comply with the applicable Federal cost principles.
    (4) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of 
construction cost methods of contracting shall not be used.
    (g) Awarding agency review. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must make 
available, upon request of the awarding agency, technical specifications 
on proposed procurements where the awarding agency believes such review 
is needed to ensure that the item and/or service specified is the one 
being proposed for purchase. This review generally will take place prior 
to the time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation 
document. However, if the grantee or subgrantee desires to have the 
review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the 
awarding agency may still review the specifications, with such review 
usually limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees must on request make available for 
awarding agency pre-award review procurement documents, such as requests 
for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc. 
when:
    (i) A grantee's or subgrantee's procurement procedures or operation 
fails to comply with the procurement standards in this section; or
    (ii) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold and is to be awarded without competition or only 
one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation; or
    (iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product; or
    (iv) The proposed award is more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold and is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder 
under a sealed bid procurement; or
    (v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract 
or increases the contract amount by more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold.
    (3) A grantee or subgrantee will be exempt from the pre-award review 
in paragraph (g)(2) of this section if the awarding agency determines 
that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this section.
    (i) A grantee or subgrantee may request that its procurement system 
be reviewed by the awarding agency to determine whether its system meets 
these standards in order for its system to be certified. Generally, 
these reviews shall occur where there is a continuous high-dollar 
funding, and third-party contracts are awarded on a regular basis.
    (ii) A grantee or subgrantee may self-certify its procurement 
system. Such self-certification shall not limit the awarding agency's 
right to survey the system. Under a self-certification procedure, 
awarding agencies may wish to rely on written assurances from the 
grantee or subgrantee that it is complying with these standards. A 
grantee or subgrantee will cite specific procedures, regulations, 
standards, etc., as being in compliance with these requirements and have 
its system available for review.
    (h) Bonding requirements. For construction or facility improvement 
contracts or subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition 
threshold, the awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and 
requirements of the grantee or subgrantee provided the awarding agency 
has made a determination that the awarding agency's interest is 
adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the 
minimum requirements shall be as follows:
    (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of 
the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist of a firm commitment 
such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument 
accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of 
his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within 
the time specified.
    (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent 
of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is

[[Page 492]]

one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all 
the contractor's obligations under such contract.
    (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of 
the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed in connection 
with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons 
supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for 
in the contract.
    (i) Contract provisions. A grantee's and subgrantee's contracts must 
contain provisions in paragraph (i) of this section. Federal agencies 
are permitted to require changes, remedies, changed conditions, access 
and records retention, suspension of work, and other clauses approved by 
the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.
    (1) Administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances 
where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such 
sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate. (Contracts more than the 
simplified acquisition threshold)
    (2) Termination for cause and for convenience by the grantee or 
subgrantee including the manner by which it will be effected and the 
basis for settlement. (All contracts in excess of $10,000)
    (3) Compliance with Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, 
entitled ``Equal Employment Opportunity,'' as amended by Executive Order 
11375 of October 13, 1967, and as supplemented in Department of Labor 
regulations (41 CFR chapter 60). (All construction contracts awarded in 
excess of $10,000 by grantees and their contractors or subgrantees)

as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). 
(Construction contracts in excess of $2000 awarded by grantees and 
subgrantees when required by Federal grant program legislation)
    (6) Compliance with Sections 103 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours 
and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-330) as supplemented by 
Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). (Construction contracts 
awarded by grantees and subgrantees in excess of $2000, and in excess of 
$2500 for other contracts which involve the employment of mechanics or 
laborers)
    (7) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining to reporting.
    (8) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining to patent rights with respect to any discovery or invention 
which arises or is developed in the course of or under such contract.
    (9) Awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to 
copyrights and rights in data.
    (10) Access by the grantee, the subgrantee, the Federal grantor

Sec. 1174.37  Subgrants.

    (a) States. States shall follow state law and procedures when 
awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a

[[Page 493]]

cost reimbursement or fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to 
local and Indian tribal governments. States shall:
    (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by 
Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations;
    (2) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon 
them by Federal statute and regulation;
    (3) Ensure that a provision for compliance with Sec. 1174.42 is 
placed in every cost reimbursement subgrant; and
    (4) Conform any advances of grant funds to subgrantees substantially 
to the same standards of timing and amount that apply to cash advances 
by Federal agencies.
    (b) All other grantees. All other grantees shall follow the 
provisions of this part which are applicable to awarding agencies when 
awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or 
fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal 
governments. Grantees shall:
    (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes a provision for compliance 
with this part;
    (2) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by 
Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations; 
and
    (3) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon 
them by Federal statutes and regulations.
    (c) Exceptions. By their own terms, certain provisions of this part 
do not apply to the award and administration of subgrants:
    (1) Section 1174.10;
    (2) Section 1174.11;

              Reports, Records, Retention, and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 1174.40  Monitoring and reporting program performance.

    (a) Monitoring by grantees. Grantees are responsible for managing 
the day-to-day operations of grant and subgrant supported activities. 
Grantees must monitor grant and subgrant supported activities to assure 
compliance with applicable Federal requirements and that performance 
goals are being achieved. Grantee monitoring must cover each program, 
function or activity.
    (b) Nonconstruction performance reports. The Federal agency may, if 
it decides that performance information available from subsequent 
applications contains sufficient information to meet its programmatic 
needs, require the grantee to submit a performance report only upon 
expiration or termination of grant support. Unless waived by the Federal 
agency this report will be due on the same date as the final Financial 
Status Report.
    (1) Grantees shall submit annual performance reports unless the 
awarding agency requires quarterly or semi-annual reports. However, 
performance reports will not be required more frequently than quarterly. 
Annual reports shall be due 90 days after the grant year, quarterly or 
semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The 
final performance report will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support. If a justified request is submitted by a 
grantee, the Federal agency may extend the due date for any performance 
report. Additionally, requirements for unnecessary performance reports 
may be waived by the Federal agency.
    (2) Performance reports will contain, for each grant, brief 
information on the following:
    (i) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives 
established for the period. Where the output of the project can be 
quantified, a computation of the cost per unit of output may be required 
if that information will be useful.
    (ii) The reasons for slippage if established objectives were not 
met.
    (iii) Additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, 
analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
    (3) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of performance reports.

[[Page 494]]

    (4) Grantees will adhere to the standards in this section in 
prescribing performance reporting requirements for subgrantees.
    (c) Construction performance reports. For the most part, on-site 
technical inspections and certified percentage-of-completion data are 
relied on heavily by Federal agencies to monitor progress under 
construction grants and subgrants. The Federal agency will require 
additional formal performance reports only when considered necessary, 
and never more frequently than quarterly.
    (d) Significant developments. Events may occur between the scheduled 
performance reporting dates which have significant impact upon the grant 
or subgrant supported activity. In such cases, the grantee must inform 
the Federal agency as soon as the following types of conditions become 
known:
    (1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially 
impair the ability to meet the objective of the award. This disclosure 
must include a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any 
assistance needed to resolve the situation.
    (2) Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and 
objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more 
beneficial results than originally planned.
    (e) Federal agencies may make site visits as warranted by program 
needs.
    (f) Waivers, extensions. (1) Federal agencies may waive any 
performance report required by this part if not needed.
    (2) The grantee may waive any performance report from a subgrantee 
when not needed. The grantee may extend the due date for any performance 
report from a subgrantee if the grantee will still be able to meet its 
performance reporting obligations to the Federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1174.41  Financial reporting.

    (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) (2) and (5) of 
this section, grantees will use only the forms specified in paragraphs 
(a) through (e) of this section, and such supplementary or other forms 
as may from time to time be authorized by OMB, for:
    (i) Submitting financial reports to Federal agencies, or
    (ii) Requesting advances or reimbursements when letters of credit 
are not used.
    (2) Grantees need not apply the forms prescribed in this section in 
dealing with their subgrantees. However, grantees shall not impose more 
burdensome requirements on subgrantees.
    (3) Grantees shall follow all applicable standard and supplemental 
Federal agency instructions approved by OMB to the extend required under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 for use in connection with forms 
specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. Federal 
agencies may issue substantive supplementary instructions only with the 
approval of OMB. Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the grantee 
to disregard any line item that the Federal agency finds unnecessary for 
its decisionmaking purposes.
    (4) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of forms required under this part.
    (5) Federal agencies may provide computer outputs to grantees to 
expedite or contribute to the accuracy of reporting. Federal agencies 
may accept the required information from grantees in machine usable 
format or computer printouts instead of prescribed forms.
    (6) Federal agencies may waive any report required by this section 
if not needed.
    (7) Federal agencies may extend the due date of any financial report 
upon receiving a justified request from a grantee.
    (b) Financial Status Report--(1) Form. Grantees will use Standard 
Form 269 or 269A, Financial Status Report, to report the status of funds 
for all nonconstruction grants and for construction grants when required 
in accordance with paragraph Sec. 1174.41(e)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (2) Accounting basis. Each grantee will report program outlays and 
program income on a cash or accrual basis as prescribed by the awarding 
agency. If the Federal agency requires accrual information and the 
grantee's accounting records are not normally kept on the accural basis, 
the grantee shall not be

[[Page 495]]

required to convert its accounting system but shall develop such accrual 
information through and analysis of the documentation on hand.
    (3) Frequency. The Federal agency may prescribe the frequency of the 
report for each project or program. However, the report will not be 
required more frequently than quarterly. If the Federal agency does not 
specify the frequency of the report, it will be submitted annually. A 
final report will be required upon expiration or termination of grant 
support.
    (4) Due date. When reports are required on a quarterly or semiannual 
basis, they will be due 30 days after the reporting period. When 
required on an annual basis, they will be due 90 days after the grant 
year. Final reports will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support.
    (c) Federal Cash Transactions Report--(1) Form. (i) For grants paid 
by letter or credit, Treasury check advances or electronic transfer of 
funds, the grantee will submit the Standard Form 272, Federal Cash 
Transactions Report, and when necessary, its continuation sheet, 
Standard Form 272a, unless the terms of the award exempt the grantee 
from this requirement.
    (ii) These reports will be used by the Federal agency to monitor 
cash advanced to grantees and to obtain disbursement or outlay 
information for each grant from grantees. The format of the report may 
be adapted as appropriate when reporting is to be accomplished with the 
assistance of automatic data processing equipment provided that the 
information to be submitted is not changed in substance.
    (2) Forecasts of Federal cash requirements. Forecasts of Federal 
cash requirements may be required in the ``Remarks'' section of the 
report.
    (3) Cash in hands of subgrantees. When considered necessary and 
feasible by the Federal agency, grantees may be required to report the 
amount of cash advances in excess of three days' needs in the hands of 
their subgrantees or contractors and to provide short narrative 
explanations of actions taken by the grantee to reduce the excess 
balances.
    (4) Frequency and due date. Grantees must submit the report no later 
than 15 working days following the end of each quarter. However, where 
an advance either by letter of credit or electronic transfer of funds is 
authorized at an annualized rate of one million dollars or more, the 
Federal agency may require the report to be submitted within 15 working 
days following the end of each month.
    (d) Request for advance or reimbursement--(1) Advance payments. 
Requests for Treasury check advance payments will be submitted on 
Standard Form 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. (This form will 
not be used for drawdowns under a letter of credit, electronic funds 
transfer or when Treasury check advance payments are made to the grantee 
automatically on a predetermined basis.)
    (2) Reimbursements. Requests for reimbursement under nonconstruction 
grants will also be submitted on Standard Form 270. (For reimbursement 
requests under construction grants, see paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section.)
    (3) The frequency for submitting payment requests is treated in 
Sec. 1174.41(b)(3).
    (e) Outlay report and request for reimbursement for construction 
programs. (1) Grants that support construction activities paid by 
reimbursement method.
    (i) Requests for reimbursement under construction grants will be 
submitted on Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Federal agencies may, however, 
prescribe the Request for Advance or Reimbursement form, specified in 
Sec. 1174.41(d), instead of this form.
    (ii) The frequency for submitting reimbursement requests is treated 
in Sec. 1174.41(b)(3).
    (2) Grants that support construction activities paid by letter of 
credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advance.
    (i) When a construction grant is paid by letter of credit, 
electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advances, the grantee will 
report its outlays to the Federal agency using Standard Form 271, Outlay 
Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The 
Federal agency will provide any necessary special instruction.

[[Page 496]]

However, frequency and due date shall be governed by Sec. 1174.41(b) (3) 
and (4).
    (ii) When a construction grant is paid by Treasury check advances 
based on periodic requests from the grantee, the advances will be 
requested on the form specified in Sec. 1174.41(d).
    (iii) The Federal agency may substitute the Financial Status Report 
specified in Sec. 1174.41(b) for the Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs.
    (3) Accounting basis. The accounting basis for the Outlay Report and 
Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs shall be governed by 
Sec. 1174.41(b)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 1174.42  Retention and access requirements for records.

    (a) Applicability. (1) This section applies to all financial and 
programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and 
other records of grantees or subgrantees which are:
    (i) Required to be maintained by the terms of this part, program 
regulations or the grant agreement, or
    (ii) Otherwise reasonably considered as pertinent to program 
regulations or the grant agreement.
    (2) This section does not apply to records maintained by contractors 
or subcontractors. For a requirement to place a provision concerning 
records in certain kinds of contracts, see Sec. 1174.36(i)(10).
    (b) Length of retention period. (1) Except as otherwise provided, 
records must be retained for three years from the starting date 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action 
involving the records has been started before the expiration of the 3-
year period, the records must be retained until completion of the action 
and resolution of all issues which arise from it, or until the end of 
the regular 3-year period, whichever is later.
    (3) To avoid duplicate recordkeeping, awarding agencies may make 
special arrangements with grantees and subgrantees to retain any records 
which are continuously needed for joint use. The awarding agency will 
request transfer of records to its custody when it determines that the 
records possess long-term retention value. When the records are 
transferred to or maintained by the Federal agency, the 3-year retention 
requirement is not applicable to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Starting date of retention period--(1) General. When grant 
support is continued or renewed at annual or other intervals, the 
retention period for the records of each funding period starts on the 
day the grantee or subgrantee submits to the awarding agency its single 
or last expenditure report for that period. However, if grant support is 
continued or renewed quarterly, the retention period for each year's 
records starts on the day the grantee submits its expenditure report for 
the last quarter of the Federal fiscal year. In all other cases, the 
retention period starts on the day the grantee submits its final 
expenditure report. If an expenditure report has been waived, the 
retention period starts on the day the report would have been due.
    (2) Real property and equipment records. The retention period for 
real property and equipment records starts from the date of the 
disposition or replacement or transfer at the direction of the awarding 
agency.
    (3) Records for income transactions after grant or subgrant support. 
In some cases grantees must report income after the period of grant 
support. Where there is such a requirement, the retention period for the 
records pertaining to the earning of the income starts from the end of 
the grantee's fiscal year in which the income is earned.
    (4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. This 
paragraph applies to the following types of documents, and their 
supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost 
allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at 
which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage 
chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).
    (i) If submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or other 
computation is required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to 
the grantee) to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-
year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of 
such submission.

[[Page 497]]

    (ii) If not submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or 
other computation is not required to be submitted to the Federal 
Government (or to the grantee) for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year 
retention period for the proposal plan, or computation and its 
supporting records starts from end of the fiscal year (or other 
accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.
    (d) Substitution of microfilm. Copies made by microfilming, 
photocopying, or similar methods may be substituted for the original 
records.
    (e) Access to records--(1) Records of grantees and subgrantees. The 
awarding agency and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any 
of their authorized representatives, shall have the right of access to 
any pertinent books, documents, papers, or other records of grantees and 
subgrantees which are pertinent to the grant, in order to make audits, 
examinations, excerpts, and transcripts.
    (2) Expiration of right of access. The rights of access in this 
section must not be limited to the required retention period but shall 
last as long as the records are retained.
    (f) Restrictions on public access. The Federal Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) does not apply to records Unless required 
by Federal, State, or local law, grantees and subgrantees are not 
required to permit public access to their records.


<R05>
Sec. 1174.43  Enforcement.

    (a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a grantee or subgrantee 
materially fails to comply with any term of an award, whether stated in 
a Federal statute or regulation, an assurance, in a State plan or 
application, a notice of award, or elsewhere, the awarding agency may 
take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the 
circumstances:
    (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the 
deficiency by the grantee or subgrantee or more severe enforcement 
action by the awarding agency,
    (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and matching credit 
for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in 
compliance,
    (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award for the 
grantee's or subgrantee's program,
    (4) Withhold further awards for the program, or
    (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.
    (b) Hearings, appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the awarding 
agency will provide the grantee or subgrantee an opportunity for such 
hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the grantee 
or subgrantee is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to 
the action involved.
    (c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of grantee or 
subgrantee resulting from obligations incurred by the grantee or 
subgrantee during a suspension or after termination of an award are not 
allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the 
notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other grantee or 
subgrantee costs during suspension or after termination which are 
necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if:
    (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred 
by the grantee or subgrantee before the effective date of suspension or 
termination, are not in anticipation of it, and, in the case of a 
termination, are noncancellable, and,
    (2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or 
expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the 
termination takes effect.
    (d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement 
remedies identified in this section, including suspension and 
termination, do not preclude grantee or subgrantee from being subject to 
``Debarment and Suspension'' under Executive Order 12549 (see 
Sec. 1174.35).


<R05>
Sec. 1174.44  Termination for convenience.

    Except as provided in Sec. 1174.43 awards may be terminated in whole 
or in part only as follows:
    (a) By the awarding agency with the consent of the grantee or 
subgrantee in which case the two parties shall agree upon the 
termination conditions, including the effective date and in the

[[Page 498]]

case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated, or
    (b) By the grantee or subgrantee upon written notification to the 
awarding agency, setting forth the reasons for such termination, the 
effective date, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to 
be terminated. However, if, in the case of a partial termination, the 
awarding agency determines that the remaining portion of the award will 
not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, the awarding 
agency may terminate the award in its entirety under either Sec. 1174.43 
or paragraph (a) of this section.


<R04>
                 Subpart D--After-the-Grant Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 1174.50  Closeout.

    (a) General. The Federal agency will close out the award when it 
determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required 
work of the grant has been completed.
    (b) Reports. Within 90 days after the expiration or termination of 
the grant, the grantee must submit all financial, performance, and other 
reports required as a condition of the grant. Upon request by the 
grantee, Federal agencies may extend this timeframe. These may include 
but are not limited to:
    (1) Final performance or progress report.
    (2) Financial Status Report (SF 269) or Outlay Report and Request 
for Reimbursement for Construction Programs (SF-271) (as applicable).
    (3) Final request for payment (SF-270) (if applicable).
    (4) Invention disclosure (if applicable).
    (5) Federally-owned property report:

In accordance with Sec. 1174.32(f), a grantee must submit an inventory 
of all federally owned property (as distinct from property acquired with 
grant funds) for which it is accountable and request disposition 
instructions from the Federal agency of property no longer needed.
    (c) Cost adjustment. The Federal agency will, within 90 days after 
receipt of reports in paragraph (b) of this section, make upward or 
downward adjustments to the allowable costs.
    (d) Cash adjustments. (1) The Federal agency will make prompt 
payment to the grantee for allowable reimbursable costs.
    (2) The grantee must immediately refund to the Federal agency any 
balance of unobligated (unencumbered) cash advanced that is not 
authorized to be retained for use on other grants.


<R05>
Sec. 1174.51  Later disallowances and adjustments.

    The closeout of a grant does not affect:
    (a) The Federal agency's right to disallow costs and recover funds 
on the basis of a later audit or other review;
    (b) The grantee's obligation to return any funds due as a result of 
later refunds, corrections, or other transactions;
    (c) Records retention as required in Sec. 1174.42;
    (d) Property management requirements in Secs. 1174.31 and 1174.32; 
and
    (e) Audit requirements in Sec. 1174.26.


<R05>
Sec. 1174.52  Collection of amounts due.

    (a) Any funds paid to a grantee in excess of the amount to which the 
grantee is finally determined to be entitled under the terms of the 
award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a 
reasonable period after demand, the Federal agency may reduce the debt 
by:
    (1) Making an adminstrative offset against other requests for 
reimbursements,
    (2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the grantee, or
    (3) Other action permitted by law.
    (b) Except where otherwise provided by statutes or regulations, the 
Federal agency will charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance 
with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR Ch. II). The date 
from which interest is computed is not extended by litigation or the 
filing of any form of appeal.

<R05>
Sec. 1175.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1175.150, no qualified 
handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1175.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does 
not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or
    (2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 1175.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.
    (b) Methods. The agency may comply with the requirements of this 
section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of 
services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, 
home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, 
alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, 
use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in 
making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The agency is nor required to make structural 
changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in 
achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making 
alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements 
to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as 
amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), and any regulations implementing 
it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of 
this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer 
programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most 
integrated setting appropriate.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by June 6, 1986, except that 
where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by April 7, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by October 7, 1986, a transition plan setting 
forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall 
provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped 
persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped 
persons;

[[Page 503]]

    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.

Sec. 1175.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the 
Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
handicapped person.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 1175.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services 
of the program or activity.

for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed 
within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may 
extend this time period for good cause.
    (e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have 
jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government 
entity.
    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), or section 502 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), is not readily

<R05>
Sec. 1176.1  General.

    (a) Purpose. Many individuals in society possess great productive 
potential which goes unrealized because they cannot meet the 
requirements of a standard workweek. Permanent part-time employment also 
provides benefits to other individuals in a variety of ways, such as 
providing older individuals with a gradual transition into retirement, 
providing employment opportunities to handicapped individuals or others 
who require a reduced workweek, providing parents with opportunities to 
balance family responsibilities with the need for added income,

[[Page 505]]

and assisting students who must finance their own education or 
vocational training. In view of this, the National Endowment for the 
Humanities will operate a part-time career employment program, 
consistent with its responsibilities and in accordance with Public Law 
95-437, the Federal Employees' Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1978.
    (b) Program Coordinator. The Personnel Officer is responsible for 
program operation and coordination.


<R05>
Sec. 1176.2  Definitions.

    (a) Part-time employment means employment of 16 to 32 hours a week 
under a schedule consisting of an equal or varied number of hours per 
day, whether in a position which would be part-time without regard to 
the Act or one established to allow job-sharing or comparable 
arrangements, but does not include employment on a temporary or 
intermittent basis.
    (b) Career employment includes competitive and excepted service 
employees in tenure groups I and II.


<R05>
Sec. 1176.3  Criteria.

    Positions becoming vacant, unless excepted as provided by 
Sec. 1176.8, will be reviewed to determine the feasibility of converting 
them to part-time. Among the criteria which may be used when conducting 
this review are:
    (a) Mission requirements.
    (b) Workload.
    (c) Employment ceilings and budgetary considerations.
    (d) Availability of qualified applicants willing to work part-time.


<R05>
Sec. 1176.4  Establishing and converting part-time positions.

    Position management and other internal reviews may indicate that 
positions may be either converted from full-time or initially 
established as part-time positions. Criteria listed in Sec. 1176.3 may 
be used during these reviews. If a decision is made to convert to or to 
establish a part-time position, regular position management and 
classification procedures will be followed.


<R05>
Sec. 1176.5  Annual plan.

    (a) An agencywide plan for promoting part-time employment 
opportunities will be developed annually. This plan will establish 
annual goals and set interim and final deadlines for achieving these 
goals. This plan will be applicable throughout the agency, and will be 
transmitted to the Office of Personnel Management with the required 
report to OPM on the status of the program as of September 30 of each 
year.
    (b) Beginning in FY 1981 in administering personnel ceilings, part-
time career employees shall be counted against ceiling authorizations as 
a fraction. This will be determined by dividing 40 hours into the 
average number of hours of such employee's regularly scheduled workweek.


<R05>
Sec. 1176.6  Review and evaluation.

    Regular employment reports will be used to determine levels of part-
time employment. This program will also be designated an item of special 
interest to be reviewed during personnel management reviews.


<R05>
Sec. 1176.7  Publicizing vacancies.

    When applicants from outside the Federal service are desired, part-
time vacanies may be publicized through various recruiting means, such 
as:
    (a) Federal Job Information Centers.
    (b) State Employment Offices.
    (c) Veterans' Administration Recruiting Bulletins.


<R05>
Sec. 1176.8  Exceptions.

    (a) The Personnel Officer may except positions from inclusion in 
this program to provide fewer than 16 hours per week. This will normally 
be done in furtherance of special hiring programs such as the Stay-in-
School or Handicapped Employment Program.
    (b) On occasions when it becomes necessary to allow supervisors and 
managers to temporarily increase the hours of duty of employees above 32 
hours per week for limited and specific periods of time to meet heavy 
workloads, perform special assignments, permit employee training, etc., 
the Endowment policy is as follows:
    (1) Requests to work NEH employees on a 32 hour/week appointment 
more than 32 hours must be submitted in advance to the Personnel Office;
    (2) Justification should be concise but specific and must state the 
exact

[[Page 506]]

time frame for the increase in hours above 32 hours per week; and
    (3) The Program Coordinator will decide if the request meets the 
intent of the law and this agency's policy.

    Source:  51 FR 20484, June 5, 1986, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1177.1  Purpose and scope.

    This part prescribes standards and procedures for officers and 
employees of the National Endowment for the Humanities who are 
responsible for the collection and disposition of debts owed to the 
United States. The authority for this part is the Federal Claims 
Collection Act of 1966, as amended, 31 U.S.C. 3711 and 3716 through 
3719; the Federal Claims Collection Standards at 4 CFR parts 101 through 
105, as amended by 49 FR 8889, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and Office of Management 
and Budget Circular A-129. The activities covered include: collecting 
claims in any amount; compromising claims, or suspending or terminating 
the collection of claims that do not exceed $20,000 exclusive of 
interest and charges, and referring debts that cannot be disposed of by 
the Endowment to the Department of Justice or to the General Accounting 
Office for further administrative action or litigation.


<R05>
Sec. 1177.2  Definitions.

    For the purpose of this part the following definitions will apply:
    (a) Claim or debt means an amount of property owed to the United 
States. These include but are not limited to: Overpayments to program 
beneficiaries; overpayments to contractors and grantees, including 
overpayments arising from audit disallowances; excessive cash advances 
to grantees and contractors; and civil penalties and assessments. A debt 
is overdue or delinquent if it is not paid by the due date specified in 
the initial notice of the debt (see Sec. 1177.6 of this part) or if the 
debtor fails to satisfy his or her obligation under a repayment 
agreement.
    (b) Debtor means an individual, organization, group, association, 
partnership, or corporation indebted to the United States, or the person 
or entity with legal responsibility for assuming the debtor's 
obligation.
    (c) Endowment means the National Endowment for the Humanities.
    (d) Administrative offset means satisfying a debt by withholding 
money payable by the United States to or held by the United States for a 
debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 1177.3  Other remedies.

    The remedies and sanctions available to the National Endowment for 
the Humanities under this part are not intended to be exclusive. The 
Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities or his designee 
may impose other appropriate sanctions upon a debtor for prolonged or 
repeated failure to pay a debt. For example, the Chairperson or his 
designee may place the debtor's name on a list of debarred, suspended, 
or ineligible grantees and contractors, convert the method of payment 
under a grant from an advance to a reimbursement method, or revoke a 
grantee's letter of credit. In such cases the debtor will be advised of 
the Endowment's action.


<R05>
Sec. 1177.4  Claims involving criminal activity or misconduct.

    (a) A debtor whose indebtedness involves criminal activity such as 
fraud, embezzlement, theft, or misuse of government funds or property is 
subject to punishment by fine or imprisonment as well as to a civil 
claim by the United

[[Page 507]]

States for compensation for the misappropriated funds. The Endowment 
will refer these cases to the appropriate law enforcement agency for 
prosecution.
    (b) Debts involving fraud, false, claims, or misrepresentation shall 
not be compromised, terminated, suspended, or otherwise disposed of 
under this rule. Only the Department of Justice is authorized to 
compromise, terminate, suspend, or otherwise dispose of such debts.


<R05>
Sec. 1177.5  Collection.

    (a) The Endowment will take aggressive action to collect debts and 
reduce delinquencies. Collection efforts shall include sending to the 
debtor's last known address a total of three progressively stronger 
written demands for payment at not more than 30 day intervals. When 
necessary to protect the Government's interest, written demand may be 
preceded by other appropriate action, including immediate referral for 
litigation. Other contact with the debtor or his or her representative 
or guarantor by telephone, in person and/or in writing may be 
appropriate to demand prompt payment, to discuss the debtor's position 
regarding the existence, amount and repayment of the debt, and to inform 
the debtor of his or her rights and the effect of nonpayment or delayed 
payment. A debtor who disputes a debt must promptly provide available 
supporting evidence.
    (b) If a debtor is involved in insolvency proceedings, the debt will 
be referred to the appropriate United States Attorney to file a claim. 
The United States may have a priority over other creditors under 31 
U.S.C. 3713.


<R05>
Sec. 1177.6  Notice to debtor.

    The first written demand for payment must inform the debtor of the 
following:
    (a) The amount and nature of the debt:
    (b) The date payment is due, which will generally be 30 days from 
the date the notice was mailed;
    (c) The assessment of interest under Sec. 1177.7 from the date the 
notice was mailed if payment is not received within the 30 days;
    (d) The right to dispute the debt;
    (e) The office, address and telphone number that the debtor should 
contact to discuss repayment and reconsideration of the debt and;
    (f) The sanctions available to the National Endowment for the 
Humanities to collect a delinquent debt including, but not limited to, 
referral of the debt to a credit reporting agency, a private collection 
bureau, or the Department of Justice for litigation.


<R05>
Sec. 1177.7  Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.

    (a) Interest will accrue on all debts from the date when the first 
notice of the debt and the interest requirement is mailed to the last 
known address or hand-delivered to the debtor if the debt is not paid 
within 30 days from the date the first notice was mailed. The Endowment 
will charge an annual rate of interest that is equal to the average 
investment rate for the Treasury tax and loan accounts on September 30 
of each year, rounded to the nearest whole per centum. This rate, which 
represents the current value of funds to the United States Treasury, may 
be revised quarterly by the Secretary of the Treasury and is published 
by the Secretary of the Treasury annually or quarterly in the Federal 
Register and the Treasury Financial Manual Bulletins.
    (b) The rate of interest initially assessed will remain fixed for 
the duration of the indebtedness, except that if a debtor defaults on a 
repayment agreement interest may be set at the Treasury rate in effect 
on the date a new agreement is executed.
    (c) The Endowment shall charge debtors for administrative costs 
incurred in handling overdue debts.
    (d) Interest will not be charged on administrative costs.
    (e) The Endowment shall assess a penalty charge, not to exceed 6 per 
cent per year on debts which have been delinquent for more than 90 days. 
This charge shall accrue from the date that the debt became delinquent.
    (f) The Chairperson or his designee may waive in whole or in part 
the collection of interest and administrative and penalty charges if 
determined that collection would be against equity or not in the best 
interests of the United

[[Page 508]]

States. The Endowment shall waive the collection of interest on the debt 
or any part of the debt which is paid within 30 days after the date on 
which interest began to accrue.


<R05>
Sec. 1177.8  Administrative offset.

    (a) The Endowment may collect debts owed by administrative offset 
if:
    (1) The debt is certain in amount;
    (2) Efforts to obtain direct payment have been, or would most likely 
be unsuccessful, or the Endowment and the debtor agree to the offset;
    (3) Offset is cost effective or has significant deterrent value; and
    (4) Offset is best suited to further and protect the Government's 
interest.
    (b) The Endowment may offset a debt owed to another Federal agency 
from amounts due or payable by the Endowment to the debtor or request 
another Federal agency to offset a debt owed to the Endowment;
    (c) Prior to initiating administrative offset, the National 
Endowment for the Humanities will send the debtor written notice of the 
following:
    (1) The nature and amount of the debt and the agency's intention to 
collect the debt by offset 30 days from the date the notice was mailed 
if neither payment nor a satisfactory response is received by that date;
    (2) The debtor's right to an opportunity to submit a good faith 
alternative repayment schedule to inspect and copy agency records 
pertaining to the debt, to request a review of the determination of 
indebtedness; and to enter into a written agreement to repay the debt 
and;
    (3) The applicable interest.
    (d) The National Endowment for the Humanities may effect an 
administrative offset against a payment to be made to a debtor prior to 
the completion of the procedures required by paragraph (c) of this 
section if:
    (1) Failure to offset would substantially prejudice the Government's 
ability to collect the debt and
    (2) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably 
permit completion of those procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 1177.9  Use of credit reporting agencies.

    (a) The Endowment may report delinquent accounts to credit reporting 
agencies consistent with the notice requirements contained in the 
Sec. 1177.6 of this part. Individual debtors must be given at least 60 
days written notice that the debt is overdue and will be reported to a 
credit reporting agency.
    (b) Debts may be reported to consumer or commercial reporting 
agencies. Consumer reporting agencies are defined in 31 U.S.C. 
3701(a)(3) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(12) and 31 U.S.C. 3711(f). The 
Endowment may disclose only an individual's name, address, social 
security number, and the nature, amount, status and history of the debt 
and the program under which the claim arose.


<R05>
Sec. 1177.10  Collection services.

    (a) The Endowment may contract for collection services to recover 
outstanding debts. The Endowment may refer delinquent debts to private 
collection agencies listed on the schedule compiled by the General 
Services Administration. In such contracts, the National Endowment for 
the Humanities will retain the authority to resolve disputes, compromise 
claims, terminate or suspend collection, and refer the matter to the 
Department of Justice or the General Accounting Office.
    (b) The contractor shall be subject to the disclosure provisions of 
the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a(m)), and to 
applicable federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to debt 
collection practices, including the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 
15 U.S.C. 1692. The contractor shall be strictly accountable for all 
amounts collected.
    (c) The contractor shall be required to provide to the Endowment any 
data contained in its files relating to the debt account upon agency 
request or upon returning an account to the Endowment for referral to 
the Department of Justice for litigation.

    Debts over $600 but less than $100,000 which the Endowment 
determines can

[[Page 509]]

Division of the Department of Justice.


<R05>

pay intervals from an employee's current pay account unless alternative 
arrangements for repayment are made.

[[Page 513]]

    (c) Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater 
than the anticipated period of employment. The size of installment 
deductions must bear a reasonable relationship to the size of the debt

for any period must not exceed 15% of disposable pay unless the employee 
has agreed in writing to a deduction of a greater amount.

NEH to satisfy debts owed to the creditor agency when the debt is 
waived, found not owed, or when directed by an administrative or 
judicial order.
    (c) Unless required by law, refunds under this section shall not 
bear interest.


<R05>

discovery and collection of such debts.


<R05>
Sec. 1179.11  Non-waiver of rights.

    An employee's involuntary payment of all or any part of a debt

        Subpart A--General Operating Support; Conservation Grants


<R05>
Sec. 1180.1  Purpose of museum services program.

    The purpose of this program of Federal financial assistance is to 
ease the financial burden borne by museums as a result of their 
increasing use by the public and to encourage and assist them to carry 
out their educational and conservation roles as well as other functions 
and to modernize their methods and facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 1180.2  Scope of this document.

    This document establishes rules for the award of grants to museums 
from funds appropriated under the Museum Services Act including rules 
governing the eligibility of applicant institutions, the type of 
assistance which may be provided, requirements which applicants must 
meet and criteria to be used in judging applications.


<R05>
Sec. 1180.3  Definition of museum.

    For the purpose of this part:
    (a) Museum means a public or private nonprofit institution which is 
organized on a permanent basis for essentially educational or aesthetic 
purposes and which, using a professional staff:
    (1) Owns or uses tangible objects, either animate or inanimate;
    (2) Cares for these objects; and
    (3) Exhibits them to the general public on a regular basis.
    (i) An institution which exhibits objects to the general public for 
at least 120 days a year shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
    (ii) An institution which exhibits objects by appointment may meet 
this requirement if it can establish, in light of the facts under all 
the relevant circumstances, that this method of exhibition does not 
unreasonably restrict the accessibility of the institution's exhibits to 
the general public.
    (b) Museum includes (but is not limited to) the following 
institutions if they satisfy the provisions of this section:
    (1) Aquariums and zoological parks;
    (2) Botanical gardens and arboretums;
    (3) Nature Centers;
    (4) Museums relating to art, history (including historic buildings), 
natural history, science and technology; and
    (5) Planetariums.
    (c) For the purposes of this section, an institution uses a 
professional staff if it employs at least one staff member, or the 
fulltime equivalent, whether paid or unpaid primarily engaged in the 
acquisition, care, or exhibition to the public of objects owned or used 
by the institution.
    (d)(1) Except as set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an 
institution exhibits objects to the general public for the purposes of 
this section if such exhibition is a primary purpose of the institution.
    (2) An institution which does not have as a primary purpose the 
exhibition of objects to the general public but which can demonstrate 
that it exhibits objects to the general public on a regular basis as a 
significant, separate, distinct, and continuing portion of its 
activities, and that it otherwise meets the requirements of this 
section,

[[Page 516]]

may be determined to be a museum under this section. In order to 
establish its eligibility, such an institution must provide information 
regarding the following:
    (i) The number of staff members devoted to museum functions as 
described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (ii) The period of time that such museum functions have been carried 
out by the institution over the course of the institution's history.
    (iii) Appropriate financial information for such functions presented 
separately from the financial information of the institution as a whole.
    (iv) The percentage of the institution's total space devoted to such 
museum functions.
    (v) Such other information as the Director requests.
    (3) The Director uses the information furnished under paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section in making a determination regarding the 
eligibility of such an institution under this section.
    (e) For the purpose of this section, an institution exhibits objects 
to the public if it exhibits the objects through facilities which it 
owns or operates.

[50 FR 27588, July 5, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 63964, Dec. 13, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1180.6  Related institutions.

    (a) If two or more institutions are under the common control of one 
agency or institution or are otherwise organizationally related and 
apply for assistance under the Act, the Director determines under all 
the relevant circumstances whether they are separate museums for the 
purposes of establishing eligibility for assistance under these 
regulations. See Secs. 1180.5 and 1180.9.
    (b) IMS regards the following factors, among others, as showing that 
a related institution is a separate museum:

[[Page 517]]

    (1) The institution has its own governing body;
    (2) The institution has budgetary autonomy; and
    (3) The institution has administrative autonomy.


<R05>
Sec. 1180.7  General Operating Support.

    In order to maintain, increase or improve museum services, a museum 
may apply for a grant under the Act to meet administrative, staff and 
operating costs, except as otherwise provided in these regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 1180.8  Two-year grant period.

    (a) IMS makes General Operating Support grants for a period of 
twenty-four months beginning with the first month of the grant period.
    (b) A museum that receives a General Operating Support grant in a 
Federal fiscal year may not apply for an additional General Operating 
Support grant in the succeeding Federal fiscal year.

    Example. A museum applies for a General Operating Support grant in 
Federal fiscal year 1993. The museum receives a grant that it may use 
during the applicable 24-month grant period. The museum may not apply 
for an additional General Operating Support grant in Federal fiscal year 
1994.

[57 FR 36905, Aug. 17, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 1180.9  Limitation on amount of General Operating Support grants.

    (a) General rule. IMS makes General Operating Support grants in an 
amount not to exceed the lesser of:
    (1) the ceiling amount established under paragraph (b);
    (2)(i) 15 percent of the applicant museum's non-Federal operating 
income for its most recently completed fiscal year that is prior to the 
Federal fiscal year in which the application is filed; or
    (ii) $7,500, if larger.
    (b) Ceiling amount. The ceiling amount of a General Operating 
Support grant will be established through a notice published in the 
Federal Register. Beginning in FY 1993, the ceiling amount is $112,500.
    (c) Statutory requirement. Under section 206(c) of the Act, IMS may 
not make a grant in excess of 50 percent of the annual cost of the 
program for which the grant is made. If the application of the $7,500 
limitation in paragraph (a)(2) of this section causes a General 
Operating Support grant to exceed 50 percent of the museum's annual 
operating income for the grant period in question, IMS reduces the grant 
to that level in order to satisfy the statutory requirement.
    (d) Computation of non-Federal operating income. For the purposes of 
this section, a museum may include in non-Federal operating income an 
amount reflecting the reasonable and conservative value of non-cash 
contributions to the museum in the applicable fiscal year.

    Examples. The application of these rules is set forth in the 
following examples:
    (1) In fiscal year 1993, a museum with calendar year 1991 operating 
income of $5,000,000 applies to IMS for a General Operating Support 
grant. Its application is approved. It may receive a grant of no more 
than $112,500, the lesser of $112,500 and $750,000 which is 15 percent 
of the museum's non-Federal operating income.
    (2) In fiscal year 1993, a museum with calendar 1991 operating 
income of $700,000 applies to IMS for a General Operating Support grant. 
Its application is approved. It may receive a grant of no more than 
$105,000 the lesser of $112,500 and 15 percent of the operating income 
which is $105,000.
    (3) In fiscal year 1993, a museum with calendar 1991 operating 
income of $40,000 applies to IMS for a General Operating Support grant. 
Its application is approved. It may receive a grant of no more than 
$7,500, the larger of $7,500 or 15 percent of the museum's operating 
income which is $6,000. The grant satisfies the requirement of paragraph 
(c) (and the statute) that it not exceed 50 percent of the museum's 
operating income for that year.

[57 FR 36905, Aug. 17, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 1180.10  Allowable costs.

    (a) Determination of costs allowable under a grant is made in 
accordance with government-wide cost principles in applicable OMB 
circulars. (OMB circular A-21 (educational institutions) February 26, 
1979, published in 44 FR 12368 (March 6, 1979); OMB circular A-87 (State 
and local governments) January 15, 1981 published in 46 FR 9548 (January 
28, 1981); and OMB circular A-122 (Nonprofit organizations) June 27, 
1980, published in 45 FR 46022 (July 8, 1980)).

[[Page 518]]

    (b) No costs shall be allowed for the purchase of any object to be 
included in the collection of a museum, except library, literary, or 
archival material specifically required for a designated activity under 
a grant under the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 1180.11  Basic requirements which a museum must meet to be considered for funding.

    (a) Application. To apply for a grant, a museum must submit the 
designated application form containing the information requested in the 
form. Failure to submit the information required by the application at 
the time of filing can subject an applicant to rejection of the 
application without consideration on its merits.
    (b) IRS letter. A museum applying as a private, nonprofit 
institution must submit a copy of the letter from the Internal Revenue 
Service indicating the applicant's eligibility for nonprofit status 
under the applicable provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as 
amended.
    (c) Financial statements. (1) Each applicant museum must submit, 
with its application at the time of filing, its financial statements for 
the two fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year for which 
application is made or, if not available, for the second and third 
immediately preceding years. Each financial statement must include a 
statement of financial operations and if applicable, a balance sheet. 
Examples of a financial statement and a balance sheet may be found in 
the Museum Accounting Guidelines of the Association of Science-
Technology Centers (1976) or in the Museum Accounting Handbook of the 
American Association of Museums (1978).
    (2)(i) Every applicant which has previously received an IMS award 
must submit its audited financial statement for the last fiscal year 
immediately preceding the fiscal year in which application is made or 
the immediately preceding fiscal year, prepared by an individual or 
organization meeting the qualifications of the Comptroller General of 
the United States for individuals or organizations conducting Government 
audits. Reference is made to GAO, Standards for Audit of Governmental 
Organizations, Programs and Functions (1981 revision).
    (ii) In the case of a museum which does not use cash basis 
accounting, the individual or organization performing the audit must 
offer an opinion that the financial statement of the museum presents 
fairly the financial position and the results of financial operations in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In the case of 
a museum which uses cash basis accounting, the individual or 
organization performing the audit must offer an opinion that the 
statement presents fairly (A) revenues collected and expenditures made 
and (B), where a balance sheet is involved, the assets, liabilities, and 
fund balances of the museum arising from cash transactions.
    (3) If a museum is part of an organization such as a university, 
State or municipality and does not receive audits separate from those of 
the organization of which it is a part, it may submit its financial 
statement as drawn from and containing only audited figures of the 
organization of which the museum is a part. This financial statement, so 
prepared, must present fairly the financial position and the results of 
financial operations of the museum, and must clearly indicate that it 
has been so prepared and the Director may, upon written request filed at 
the time of the application, waive the requirement of a separate audit 
and proceed to process the application on its merits. Where the 
organization is not audited on an annual basis, the financial statement 
may be drawn from the most recent audited figures of the organization.
    (4) The Director is authorized to defer the audit requirement set 
forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section in the case of a museum with 
non-federal operating income of $250,000 or less, exclusive of the value 
of non-cash contributions (in the fiscal period preceding the fiscal 
period for which the deferral is requested) if the Director finds that 
circumstances justify a deferral and that the grant of the deferral will 
not be inequitable to other applicants. A deferral may be granted only 
upon those conditions and in light of those assurances which the 
Director deems appropriate in order to ensure that the

[[Page 519]]

purposes of this paragraph are achieved. If the museum receives an 
award, the museum must submit audited financial statements no later than 
the end of the grant period for which the deferral is requested.
    (d) Long-range plans. Each applicant museum must include long-range 
plans for program and financial development.

<R05>
Sec. 1180.12  How applications are judged.

    (a) To select grantees and determine the amount of their awards. IMS 
rates competitive applications under the applicable criteria stated in 
Sec. 1180.13. Normally, these applications are first evaluated by field 
reviewers, panels of experts, or both. Final determinations as to the 
award of grants are made by the Director after review by the Board.
    (b) To achieve diversity in the distribution of assistance, the 
Institute may consider the location, size and discipline of the 
applicant in addition to the criteria in Sec. 1180.13.

[50 FR 27588, July 5, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 1180.13  Criteria for evaluation of applications for General Operating Support.

    The following criteria apply to the evaluation of all applications 
for General Operating Support. In applying these criteria, the total 
operation of the applicant museum is assessed, including the museum's 
operation as it would be if the General Operating Support is granted. 
This assessment is based primarily on the information supplied in the 
museum's application.
    (a) Museum services. Are the applicant's museum services of high 
quality? IMS considers factors such as:
    (1) The quality of the museum's educational and interpretive 
services and their relevance to the collections and audience including 
the special constituencies which the museum serves;
    (2) The quality of the museum's physical facilities and the manner 
in which space is allocated to various museum activities; and
    (3) The qualifications of the professional staff (both full-time and 
part-time; paid and volunteer) and the quality of the opportunities for 
professional staff development and in-service training afforded by the 
museum.
    (b) Collections and exhibits. Are the museum's collections and 
exhibits of high quality and significance? IMS takes into account such 
factors as:
    (1) The intrinsic value of the collections and exhibits;
    (2) The significance of the museum's collections to the community; 
and
    (3) The quality of the care and conservation of the collections; the 
quality of exhibit designs.
    (c) Accessibility. How accessible to the general public are the 
museum's services, collections and exhibits? IMS considers such factors 
as:
    (1) The percentage of the museum's collections on view to the 
general public on a regular basis; the extent of the museum's regular 
program for outreach, loans, and other means of exhibiting its 
collections to the public;
    (2) The annual schedule of open hours for the museum; and
    (3) The appropriateness of this schedule to the museum's audience.
    (d) Population served. To what extent does the museum serve a 
general public which otherwise would have limited access to the type of 
museum services which it provides or to museum services of any type? To 
what extent does the public seek access to the museum's services? IMS 
considers such factors as:
    (1) The characteristics of the audience and the community which the 
museum serves;
    (2) The availability of other museums (or types of museums) which 
serve this audience and this community; and
    (3) The museum's annual attendance by calendar quarters.
    (e) Financial Management. What is the quality of the financial 
management of the museum? In how many of the last five years has the 
museum shown an excess of revenues over expenditures? IMS considers such 
factors as:
    (1) The financial condition of the museum as reflected in its 
financial statements;

[[Page 520]]

    (2) The quality of the museum's plans for remedying any financial 
weaknesses in the museum's operations; and
    (3) The qualifications of the museum staff assigned to financial 
management activities.
    (f) Long-range plans. What is the quality of the museum's long-range 
plans for financial and program development? What are the museum's plans 
for the expenditure of the grant funds? IMS considers such factors as:
    (1) The quality of the museum's long-range plans; how the museum 
proposes to implement them; how practical are the steps the museum plans 
to take to implement them?
    (2) The probability that the General Operating Support grant, if 
awarded, will assist the museum in carrying out its long-range plans;
    (3) In what manner will this grant, if awarded, contribute to 
maintaining, increasing or improving the museum's services?
    (g) Community commitment. How committed to the museum are its users 
and supporters? Does the museum have a substantial base of non-Federal 
support? Does it have a strong volunteer program? IMS considers such 
factors as:
    (1) The quality and extent of the financial support that the museum 
receives from the private sector and other non-Federal sources and the 
extent to which this support is stable, broad-based and indicative of 
continuing community commitment;
    (2) The quality of the museum's volunteer program and its program of 
in-kind contributions and their importance to the museum's annual 
operations; and
    (3) The commitment of its users to the museum as evidenced by such 
factors as participation in membership and docent programs, fund raising 
and other supportive activities.
    (h) Non-Federal support. To what extent, if any, will the General 
Operating Support requested enable the museum to increase its base of 
State, local and private funding in the year for which assistance is 
requested and beyond?
    (i) Past use of IMS funds (when applicable). Has the museum used its 
IMS funds effectively? How and in what amounts and in what manner have 
they been used?

<R05>
Sec. 1180.19  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1180.20  Guidelines and standards for conservation projects.

    (a) Scope. The guidelines and standards in this document apply to 
all aspects of the IMS conservation grant program including the 
submission of applications by museums for conservation grants, to the 
award, review and approval of such applications by IMS, and to the 
carrying out of conservation grants awarded by IMS.
    (b) Applicability of regulations. (1) Except as otherwise provided 
in these guidelines, subparts A-C of this part, part 1180 of Title 45 
CFR, (45 CFR 1180.1-1180.58) (IMS Grants Regulations), as amended, 
including Secs. 1180.35, 1180.41, 1180.45, 1180.48, and 1180.49, apply 
to the IMS conservation grant program.
    (2) Sections 1180.11(d) does not apply. A museum which applies for a 
conservation grant need not submit a long-range plan.
    (3) Section 1180.16(b), which provides for the maintenance of a 
restricted account, does apply to conservation grants.
    (4) Section 1180.18 (relating to maintenance of effort) does not 
apply.
    (5) In addition to submitting the final report required by 
Sec. 1180.17, a grantee must submit an interim report in accordance with 
a schedule set forth in the grant award document. An applicant that has 
received a prior conservation grant from IMS the performance of which 
has not been completed may be required to submit an additional 
performance report or submit an interim report early.
    (c) Definition. As used in these guidelines, the term conservation 
includes, but is not limited to, the following functions, as applied to 
art, history, natural history, science and technology, and living 
collections:
    (1) Technical examination of materials and surveys of environmental 
and collection conditions;
    (2) Provision, insofar as practicable, of optimum environmental 
conditions for housing, exhibition, monitoring, reformating, nurturing 
and transportation of objects;
    (3) Physical treatment of objects, specimens and organisms, for the 
purpose of stabilizing, conserving and preserving their condition, 
removal of inauthentic additions or accretions, and physical 
compensation for losses; species survival activities; and
    (4) Research and training in conservation.
    (d) Applicants. Under the Museum Services Act only a museum may 
receive a grant. (20 U.S.C. 965(a)). See Sec. 1180.3 of the IMS 
regulations for the definition of ``museum''. A museum may apply for and 
receive only one conservation grant under this program in a fiscal year.
    (e) Types of conservation projects funded. IMS considers 
applications to carry out conservation projects such as:
    (1) Projects to develop improved or less costly methods of 
conservation, or to maintain or improve conservation with respect to one 
or more collections, including--
    (i) Projects involving surveys of conservation needs and
    (ii) Projects to establish or maintain optimum environmental 
conditions.
    (2) Projects to conduct research in conservation (including 
developmental and basic research).
    (3) Projects to conduct or obtain training in conservation 
(including training of persons for careers as professional conservators; 
training or upgrading of practicing conservators and conservation 
technicians in the use of new materials and techniques; and training of 
persons to become conservation technicians).
    (4) Projects related to museum conservation needs not regularly 
addressed by other Federal funding agencies.
    (5) Projects to meet the conservation needs of museums which are 
unable to maintain their own individual conservation facilities. Because 
grants are made only to museums, organizations which operate regional 
conservation centers but which are not museums are ineligible for a 
direct grant. However, a museum or a group of museums may use a grant to 
obtain services from such a center.

[[Page 522]]

    (6) Projects to conserve particular objects in a museum's collection 
(including plants and animals) or to meet the conservation needs of a 
particular museum (through such activities as the employment of 
conservators and the procurement of conservation services or equipment).
    (f) Limits for Federal funding. (1) The normal amount of a 
Conservation Project Support grant will be established through a notice 
published in the Federal Register. Beginning in FY 1996, the normal 
maximum amount is $50,000. Unless otherwise provided by law, if the 
Director determines that exceptional circumstance warrant, the Director, 
consistent with the policy direction of the Board, may award a 
conservation grant which obligates an amount in Federal funds in excess 
of the normal maximum award. IMS may establish a maximum award level for 
exceptional project grants for a particular fiscal year through 
information made available in guidelines or other material distributed 
to all applicants.
    (2) A conservation grant is not included in the maximum amount which 
a museum may expect to receive from IMS for a fiscal year, as set forth 
pursuant to Sec. 1180.9 of the regulations. Therefore, a museum may 
receive, for example, a General Operating Support grant for the amount 
specified pursuant to that section and an additional amount for a 
conservation grant in a fiscal year.
    (3) IMS makes conservation grants only on a matching basis. This 
means that at least 50 per cent of the costs of a conservation project 
must be met from non-federal funds. Principles in applicable OMB 
circulars regarding costs sharing or matching apply. See, e.g., OMB 
Circular A-102, Attachment F.
    (g) Application requirements; priorities; survey required in certain 
cases. (1) Application requirements in Sec. 1180.11 (a), (b), and (c) 
apply. An application shall describe when, during the term of the grant, 
the applicant plans to complete each objective or phase of the project. 
Where appropriate, IMS may require an applicant to submit a 
dissemination plan.
    (2) The Board, by notice published in the Federal Register, may 
establish priorities with respect to all or part of the funds available 
to IMS for conservation for a fiscal year among the types of projects 
specified in paragraph (e) of this section. If the Board establishes one 
or more types of projects as a priority for a fiscal year, applications 
proposing projects of that type (or types) are evaluated, ranked and (if 
recommended for funding) approved before applications proposing other 
types of projects.
    (3) The Director may, to the extent appropriate, require (by 
instructions in the application materials) that an applicant which 
proposes a project to conserve particular objects must show that, prior 
to the submission of the application, it has carried out a general 
survey of its conservation needs and priorities and that the project in 
question is consistent with such survey. In exceptional circumstances, 
the Director may adjust this requirement, consistent with the policy 
direction of the Board. The Director may also (through such 
instructions) require an applicant for a conservation project to submit 
additional information, material, or undertakings to carry out the 
purposes of this part.
    (h) Procedures for review of applications. (1) IMS uses the 
procedures stated in this paragraph to review applications for 
conservation projects.
    (2) IMS evaluates all eligible applications for conservation 
projects in accordance with applicable criteria. (See paragraph (i) of 
this section.) The Director expects to use panels of experts to review 
at least a portion of the applications for conservation grants. 
Depending upon the number of applications received as well as other 
factors, the Director may also use field reviewers to evaluate 
applications before submission of applications to the panels. In 
addition, the Director may use technical experts to provide technical 
advice regarding certain applications. See generally Sec. 1180.12 of the 
IMS regulations.
    (3) IMS evaluates applications for conservation projects separately 
from applications for general operating support.

[[Page 523]]

    (i) Criteria. This paragraph sets forth the criteria which IMS uses 
in evaluating and reviewing applications for conservation grants. 
Panelists and field reviewers are instructed to use only these criteria 
in the evaluation and review of these applications.
    (1) The following programmatic criteria apply to the evaluation and 
review of conservation grants:
    (i) What is the importance of the object or objects to be conserved? 
What is the significance of the object or objects to the museum's 
collection and/or audience?
    (ii) What is the need for the project, including the relationship of 
the project to the conservation needs and priorities of the applicant 
museum as reflected in a survey of conservation needs or similar needs 
assessment?
    (iii) What are the applicant's plans to use and maintain the 
anticipated results or benefits of the project after the expiration of 
Federal support?
    (iv) Does the applicant plan to devote adequate financial and other 
resources to the project without inhibiting its ongoing activities?
    (2) The following technical criteria apply to the evaluation and 
review of applications for conservation grants:
    (i) What is the nature of the proposed project with respect to 
project design and management plan?
    (ii) To what extent does the application exhibit knowledge of the 
technical area to which the conservation project relates and employ the 
most promising or appropriate methods or techniques of conservation? To 
what extent is the conservation project likely to use, develop or 
demonstrate improved, more efficient, or more economic methods of 
conservation?
    (iii) Does the project have an adequate budget to achieve its 
purpose? Is the budget reasonable and adequate in relation to the 
objectives of the project?
    (iv) What are the qualifications of the personnel the applicant 
plans to use on the project and the proposed time that each such person 
is obligated to commit to the project?
    (j) Duration of grant. IMS makes a conservation grant under this 
section for a period of not to exceed two years.
    (k) Grant condition. An applicant which has received a grant in a 
prior fiscal year under the IMS conservation grant program may not 
receive a grant in a subsequent fiscal year under this section until 
required reports have been submitted regarding the performance of the 
previous grant.
    (l) Allowable and unallowable costs. (1) Section 1180.10 of the IMS 
regulations, which applies to conservation grants, sets forth the rules 
applicable to determining the allowability of costs under IMS grants and 
refers readers to the OMB circulars containing applicable cost 
principles which govern Federal grants generally.
    (2) In general such costs as compensation for personal services, 
costs of materials and supplies, rental costs, and other administrative 
costs specifically related to a conservation project are allowable under 
a conservation grant in accordance with applicable cost principles.
    (3) Costs of alterations, repairs and restoration to an existing 
facility are allowable when they are related to a conservation project 
under a conservation grant in accordance with applicable cost 
principles.
    (4) Costs of equipment are generally allowable if related to a 
conservation project but do require the specific approval of the 
Director as indicated in the grant award document.
    (5) A grantee may award a stipend to an individual for training in 
connection with a conservation project. Stipends and allowances may be 
paid at rates and under conditions established by the Director 
consistent with policies of other agencies in the Foundation or other 
agencies or instrumentalities of the United States providing comparable 
assistance with respect to conservation.
    (6) Costs of new construction are unallowable. For example, a museum 
may not a use a conservation grant to construct a new building or an 
addition to an existing building to improve the environment in which its 
collections are housed.

    (5) Preference for funding will be given to a museum that has not 
received any grants from the Institute

[[Page 531]]

within two years of the deadline to which it applies over funding for a 
museum that has received a grant from the Institute within two years of 
application.
    (c) Applicability of other regulations. The following sections in 
part 1180 do apply to grants for training and implementation under this 
subpart: Sections 1180.3(d), 1180.4, 1180.5(c)-(e), 1180.6, 1180.10, 
1180.11(a)-(b), 1180.16(b), 1180.30-34, 1180.36-37, 1180.39, 1180.42-44, 
1180.47-48, 1180.51-57, part 1183, part 1185.
    (d) Application requirements. (1) An applicant under this subpart 
must submit an application in such time and such manner, and containing 
such information, as requested by the Institute.
    (2) An applicant must submit with its application financial

    (e) Procedures and criteria for review of applications. (1) To 
evaluate applications and determine the amount of their awards, the 
Institute rates competitive applications under the criteria stated in 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Normally, these applications are 
evaluated by field reviewers, panels of experts, or both. The director 
may also use technical experts in the review of applications.
    (2) This paragraph sets forth the criteria the Institute uses in 
evaluating and reviewing applications for technical training and 
implementation grants under this subpart. Evaluators are instructed to 
use only these criteria in the evaluation of these applications.
    (i) Does the museum demonstrate its importance to the community it 
serves?
    (ii) Is the type of training requested appropriate to the purpose or 
mission of the museum?
    (iii) Are the costs requested to obtain the training reasonable and 
necessary?
    (iv) Is the training needed at the museum?
    (v) Is the staff member(s) (paid or volunteer) identified to receive 
the training the appropriate person(s) within the museum's 
organizational structure?
    (vi) Does the individual(s) identified for training demonstrate at 
least a two-year commitment to the museum field?
    (vii) Does the museum demonstrate a commitment to implement the 
training?
    (f) Allowable costs. (1) A museum may use a grant under this subpart 
for expenses to obtain training in areas of museum operations and for 
activities to implement the training.
    (2) Funds may be used to pay for registration or tuition fees for 
training courses or workshops. Individual(s) may use the grant funds to 
pay for a course that is part of a degree-granting program only for non-
credit such as to audit the course.) Funds are generally not intended to 
support attendance at association annual meetings unless a specific 
training session or workshop is part of the meeting (or as a pre or post 
conference activity). A course of study that is identified by clearly 
and specifically named sessions that are part of an annual meeting 
program and that clearly and specifically address the area of training 
need will be considered.
    (3) Funds may be used for travel to and from training activities and 
expenses incurred during travel, such as housing and meals.
    (4) Funds may be used to purchase instructional materials.
    (5) Funds may not be used to pay the salary of the person(s) 
receiving the training. The time the staff member(s) expends to obtain 
the training and to implement the training is considered a matching, in-
kind contribution to the grant activities.
    (6) Funds may not be used for consulting fees. (In special cases 
where training is not available otherwise, the Institute may consider an 
individually designed training agenda that includes the use of a 
consultant clearly serving as a trainer to the applicant in specific 
areas of museum operations.)
    (7) Funds may be used to purchase supplies, materials, and equipment 
for areas of museum operations for which training was received.
    (8) Funds may support additional travel as needed to implement 
training (eg. travel to libraries, archives, etc. to document 
collections).

[[Page 532]]

    (g) Conditions of participation. Following the completion of the 
training activity the museum must submit an implementation plan to the 
Institute for review before implementation funds are released. The 
implementation plan must indicate the time frame for implementation 
activities, the personnel involved, the activities to be completed, 
where the activities will take place, and the costs for implementing the 
plan.
    (h) Form of assistance: Limitation of amount. (1) The Director makes 
payments to a museum under this subpart in advance.
    (2) The amount of the grant to a museum will be determined by the 
Director, in accordance with the policy direction of the Board, 
regarding the maximum amount available for each part of the grant. The 
amount of the grant will be subject to the availability of funds.
    (i) Reporting requirements. The museum receiving a grant for 
training and implementation under this subpart must submit a final 
financial and narrative report that evaluates the success of the 
applicant in meeting the stated goals and any plans to continue 
activities in the area of training.
    (j) Limitation on number of applications. A museum may submit only 
one application for each deadline.
    (k) Duration of grant. (1) Grants made under this subpart generally 
permit the grantee to use the funds for a period of up to 24 months from 
the start of the grant period. The grantee may use grant funds during 
the period specified in the grant document unless the grant is suspended 
or terminated.
    (2) If the grantee needs additional time to complete the grant, the 
grantee may apply for an extension of the grant period without 
additional funds. The Director may approve this extension at his or her 
discretion.

    (1) It carries by a majority of all those holding offices as NMSB 
members at the time of the vote;
    (2) No proxies are counted toward the necessary majority; and
    (3) The individual vote of each member voting is recorded.
    (b) Within one day of a record vote to close, or withhold 
information about a meeting, or any record vote for this purpose that 
does not achieve the necessary majority, the NMSB makes available to the 
public a written record showing the vote of each member.
    (c) The NMSB may take a vote with respect to matters governed by 
this part (without convening) by means of circulation of a written 
ballot, tally sheet, or other notation procedures.

                        Announcement of Meetings


<R05>
Sec. 1180.84  Public announcement of meetings.

    (a) Except as stated in paragraphs (b) and (c) this section, the 
NMSB makes a public announcement of each meeting at least one week 
before the meeting. The announcement covers:
    (1) The time, place, and subject matter of the meeting;
    (2) What portions of the meeting, if any, are to be closed to the 
public; and
    (3) The name and phone number of the official designated to respond 
to requests for information on the meeting.
    (b) The announcement may be made less than a week before the meeting 
it announces or after the meeting only if--
    (1) The NMSB by record vote determines that agency business requires 
the meeting to be called on such short or after-the-fact notice and (2) 
a public announcement is made at the earliest practicable time.
    (c) All or any portion of the announcement of any meeting may be 
omitted if the NMSB by record vote determines that the announcement 
would disclose information which should be withheld under the same 
standards as apply for closing meetings under Sec. 1180.88.


<R05>
Sec. 1180.85  Changes in time or place of meeting.

    The time or place of a meeting of the NMSB that has been publicly 
announced as provided in Sec. 1180.84 may subsequently be changed. 
However, the change must be publicly announced at the earliest 
practicable time.


<R05>
Sec. 1180.86  Changes in subject matter of meeting.

    The subject matter of any portion of any meeting of the NMSB that 
has been publicly announced as provided in Sec. 1180.84 (or the 
determination whether any portion of any meeting so publicly announced 
will be open or closed) may subsequently be changed if--
    (a) The NMSB determines by record vote that agency business so 
requires and that no earlier announcement of change was possible; and
    (b) The NMSB publicly announces the change and the vote of each 
member on the change at the earliest practicable time. (Deletion or 
postponement of agenda items are not subject to the requirements of this 
section.)


<R05>
Sec. 1180.87  Publication of announcements.

    Promptly following a public announcement required by these 
regulations, the NMSB submits, for publication in the Federal Register, 
a notice containing information regarding the announcement as required 
by section 552b.

                             Closed Meetings


<R05>
Sec. 1180.88  Reasons and procedures for closing meetings.

    (a) The NMSB may, by record vote in accordance with section 552b, 
close any portion of a meeting if it determines that the portion falls 
within one of the exceptions stated in 5 U.S.C. section 552(c). (These 
exceptions are listed in Appendix A.)
    (b) In making a determination under paragraph (a) of this section, 
the NMSB considers whether the public interest merits keeping the 
meeting open although an exception applies.

[[Page 534]]

    (c) The Board addresses requests for the certification required by 
section 552b to the individual responsible for providing legal services 
to the Institute with respect to section 552b.
    (d) Within one day of a record vote closing a portion of a NMSB 
meeting, the NMSB makes available a full written explanation of the 
NMSB's action and a list of all persons it expects to attend the meeting 
and their affiliations.


<R05>
Sec. 1180.89  Requests to close meetings.

    A person who believes his or her interests may be directly affected 
by a meeting or a portion of a meeting may request the NMSB to close it 
to the public for a reason cited in paragraphs (5), (6), or (7) of 
Appendix A. Such requests are handled under procedures established by 
the NMSB in accordance with section 552b. This information collection 
has been assigned OMB No. 3137-0005.


<R05>
Sec. 1180.90  Materials related to closed portions of meetings.

    If a portion or portions of any meeting of the NMSB are closed to 
the public--
    (a) The presiding officer of the meeting (usually the Chairman of 
the NMSB) furnishes a statement setting forth the time and place of the 
meeting and the persons present (including staff).
    (b) Except where the Act authorizes minutes to be kept, the NMSB 
makes a complete transcript or electronic recording adequate to record 
fully the proceedings of each portion of the meeting that is closed to 
the public.
    (c) The NMSB maintains the presiding officer's statement, the 
certificate described in Sec. 1180.88(c) as required by section 552b, 
and the transcript, recording, or minutes of the meeting for at least 
two years after the meeting and at least one year after the NMSB

Sec. 1180.91  Opening of transcript or recording of closed meeting.

    (a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this section, the NMSB 
makes available for inspection the transcript, electronic recording or 
minutes of every portion of a very closed meeting on request tm any 
member of the public. The transcript or recording is made available in 
an easily accessible place. The NMSB furnishes to any member of the 
public on request copies of the transcript (or of a transcription of the 
recording) disclosing the identity of each speaker. The NMSB charges for 
the copies or transcriptions no more than the actual cost of duplication 
or transcription.
    (b) The NMSB withholds the transcripts or recording of the 
discussion of any agenda item if the Chairman of the NMSB (or a NMSB 
member designated by the Chairman) determines that the discussion 
contains information which should be withheld under the same standards 
which apply for closing meetings under Sec. 1180.88. The NMSB releases 
the transcript or recording so withheld when the Chairman (or the 
Chairman's designee) determines that the grounds for withholding no 
longer apply.

                         Appendix A to Part 1180

proposed action or is required by law to make such disclosure on its own 
initiative before taking final action; or
    (10) Is likely to specifically concern the IMS participation in a 
civil action or proceeding, or action in a foreign court or 
international tribunal, or an arbitration.

Sec. 1181.140  Employment.

    No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, be

<R05>
Sec. 1181.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1181.150, no qualified 
handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1181.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does 
not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or
    (2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 1181.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.
    (b) Methods. The agency may comply with the requirements of this 
section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of 
services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, 
home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, 
alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, 
use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in 
making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The agency is nor required to make structural 
changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in 
achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making 
alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements 
to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as 
amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In 
choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this 
section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer 
programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most 
integrated setting appropriate.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by June 6, 1986, except that 
where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by April 7, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be

[[Page 539]]

undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, 
by October 7, 1986, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary 
to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to 
interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations 
representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of 
the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A 
copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public 
inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped 
persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.

Sec. 1181.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the 
Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 
CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.

Sec. 1181.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
handicapped person.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 1181.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action

[[Page 540]]

that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would 
nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped 
persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), or section 502 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), is not readily

from the complainant, he or she shall have 60 days from the date of 
receipt of the additional information to make his or her determination 
on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.

<R05>
Sec. 1183.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Accrued expenditures mean the charges incurred by the grantee during 
a given period requiring the provision of funds for: (1) Goods and other 
tangible property received; (2) services performed by employees, 
contractors, subgrantees, subcontractors, and other payees; and (3) 
other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current services 
or performance is required, such as annuities, insurance claims, and 
other benefit payments.
    Accrued income means the sum of: (1) Earnings during a given period 
from services performed by the grantee and goods and other tangible 
property delivered to purchasers, and (2) amounts becoming owed to the 
grantee for which no current services or performance is required by the 
grantee.
    Acquisition cost of an item of purchased equipment means the net 
invoice unit price of the property including the cost of modifications, 
attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the 
property usable for the purpose for which it was acquired. Other charges 
such as the cost of installation, transportation, taxes, duty or 
protective in-transit insurance, shall be included or excluded from the 
unit acquisition cost in accordance with the grantee's regular 
accounting practices.
    Administrative requirements mean those matters common to grants in 
general, such as financial management, kinds and frequency of reports, 
and retention of records. These are distinguished from programmatic 
requirements, which concern matters that can be treated only on a 
program-by-program or grant-by-grant basis, such as kinds of activities 
that can be supported by grants under a particular program.
    Awarding agency means (1) with respect to a grant, the Federal 
agency, and (2) with respect to a subgrant, the party that awarded the 
subgrant.
    Cash contributions means the grantee's cash outlay, including the 
outlay of money contributed to the grantee or subgrantee by other public 
agencies

[[Page 542]]

and institutions, and private organizations and individuals. When 
authorized by Federal legislation, Federal funds received from other 
assistance agreements may be considered as grantee or subgrantee cash 
contributions.
    Contract means (except as used in the definitions for grant and 
subgrant in this section and except where qualified by Federal) a 
procurement contract under a grant or subgrant, and means a procurement 
subcontract under a contract.
    Cost sharing or matching means the value of the third party in-kind 
contributions and the portion of the costs of a federally assisted 
project or program not borne by the Federal Government.
    Cost-type contract means a contract or subcontract under a grant in 
which the contractor or subcontractor is paid on the basis of the costs 
it incurs, with or without a fee.
    Equipment means tangible, nonexpendable, personal property having a 
useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or 
more per unit. A grantee may use its own definition of equipment 
provided that such definition would at least include all equipment 
defined above.
    Expenditure report means: (1) For nonconstruction grants, the SF-269 
``Financial Status Report'' (or other equivalent report); (2) for 
construction grants, the SF-271 ``Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement'' (or other equivalent report).
    Federally recognized Indian tribal government means the governing 
body or a governmental agency of any Indian tribe, band, nation, or 
other organized group or community (including any Native village as 
defined in section 3 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, 85 Stat 
688) certified by the Secretary of the Interior as eligible for the 
special programs and services provided by him through the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs.
    Government means a State or local government or a federally 
recognized Indian tribal government.
    Grant means an award of financial assistance, including cooperative 
agreements, in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, by the 
Federal Government to an eligible grantee. The term does not include 
technical assistance which provides services instead of money, or other 
assistance in the form of revenue sharing, loans, loan guarantees, 
interest subsidies, insurance, or direct appropriations. Also, the term 
does not include assistance, such as a fellowship or other lump sum 
award, which the grantee is not required to account for.
    Grantee means the government to which a grant is awarded and which 
is accountable for the use of the funds provided. The grantee is the 
entire legal entity even if only a particular component of the entity is 
designated in the grant award document.
    Local government means a county, municipality, city, town, township, 
local public authority (including any public and Indian housing agency 
under the United States Housing Act of 1937) school district, special 
district, intrastate district, council of governments (whether or not 
incorporated as a nonprofit corporation under state law), any other 
regional or interstate government entity, or any agency or 
instrumentality of a local government.
    Obligations means the amounts of orders placed, contracts and 
subgrants awarded, goods and services received, and similar transactions 
during a given period that will require payment by the grantee during 
the same or a future period.
    OMB means the United States Office of Management and Budget.
    Outlays (expenditures) mean charges made to the project or program. 
They may be reported on a cash or accrual basis. For reports prepared on 
a cash basis, outlays are the sum of actual cash disbursement for direct 
charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense incurred, 
the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the amount of cash 
advances and payments made to contractors and subgrantees. For reports 
prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, outlays are the sum of actual 
cash disbursements, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value 
of inkind contributions applied, and the new increase (or decrease) in 
the amounts owed by the grantee for goods and other property received, 
for services performed by employees, contractors, subgrantees, 
subcontractors, and

[[Page 543]]

other payees, and other amounts becoming owed under programs for which 
no current services or performance are required, such as annuities, 
insurance claims, and other benefit payments.
    Percentage of completion method refers to a system under which 
payments are made for construction work according to the percentage of 
completion of the work, rather than to the grantee's cost incurred.
    Prior approval means documentation evidencing consent prior to 
incurring specific cost.
    Real property means land, including land improvements, structures 
and appurtenances thereto, excluding movable machinery and equipment.
    Share, when referring to the awarding agency's portion of real 
property, equipment or supplies, means the same percentage as the 
awarding agency's portion of the acquiring party's total costs under the 
grant to which the acquisition costs under the grant to which the 
acquisition cost of the property was charged. Only costs are to be 
counted--not the value of third-party in-kind contributions.
    State means any of the several States of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or 
possession of the United States, or any agency or instrumentality of a 
State exclusive of local governments. The term does not include any 
public and Indian housing agency under United States Housing Act of 
1937.
    Subgrant means an award of financial assistance in the form of 
money, or property in lieu of money, made under a grant by a grantee to 
an eligible subgrantee. The term includes financial assistance when 
provided by contractual legal agreement, but does not include 
procurement purchases, nor does it include any form of assistance which 
is excluded from the definition of grant in this part.
    Subgrantee means the government or other legal entity to which a 
subgrant is awarded and which is accountable to the grantee for the use 
of the funds provided.
    Supplies means all tangible personal property other than equipment 
as defined in this part.
    Suspension means depending on the context, either (1) temporary 
withdrawal of the authority to obligate grant funds pending corrective 
action by the grantee or subgrantee or a decision to terminate the 
grant, or (2) an action taken by a suspending official in accordance 
with agency regulations implementing E.O. 12549 to immediately exclude a 
person from participating in grant transactions for a period, pending 
completion of an investigation and such legal or debarment proceedings 
as may ensue.
    Termination means permanent withdrawal of the authority to obligate 
previously-awarded grant funds before that authority would otherwise 
expire. It also means the voluntary relinquishment of that authority by 
the grantee or subgrantee. Termination does not include: (1) Withdrawal 
of funds awarded on the basis of the grantee's underestimate of the 
unobligated balance in a prior period; (2) Withdrawal of the unobligated 
balance as of the expiration of a grant; (3) Refusal to extend a grant 
or award additional funds, to make a competing or noncompeting 
continuation, renewal, extension, or supplemental award; or (4) voiding 
of a grant upon determination that the award was obtained fraudulently, 
or was otherwise illegal or invalid from inception.
    Terms of a grant or subgrant mean all requirements of the grant or 
subgrant, whether in statute, regulations, or the award document.
    Third party in-kind contributions mean property or services which 
benefit a federally assisted project or program and which are 
contributed by non-Federal third parties without charge to the grantee, 
or a cost-type contractor under the grant agreement.
    Unliquidated obligations for reports prepared on a cash basis mean 
the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee that has not been 
paid. For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, they 
represent the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee for which an 
outlay has not been recorded.
    Unobligated balance means the portion of the funds authorized by the 
Federal agency that has not been obligated by the grantee and is 
determined

[[Page 544]]

by deducting the cumulative obligations from the cumulative funds 
authorized.

<R04>
                    Subpart B--Pre-Award Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 1183.10  Forms for applying for grants.

    (a) Scope. (1) This section prescribes forms and instructions to be 
used by governmental organizations (except hospitals and institutions of 
higher education operated by a government) in applying for grants. This 
section is not applicable, however, to formula grant programs which do 
not require applicants to apply for funds on a project basis.
    (2) This section applies only to applications to Federal agencies 
for grants, and is not required to be applied by grantees in dealing 
with applicants for subgrants. However, grantees are encouraged to avoid 
more detailed or burdensome application requirements for subgrants.
    (b) Authorized forms and instructions for governmental 
organizations. (1) In applying for grants, applicants shall only use 
standard application forms or those prescribed by the granting agency 
with the approval of OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
    (2) Applicants are not required to submit more than the original and 
two copies of preapplications or applications.
    (3) Applicants must follow all applicable instructions that bear OMB 
clearance numbers. Federal agencies may specify and describe the 
programs, functions, or activities that will be used to plan, budget, 
and evaluate the work under a grant. Other supplementary instructions 
may be issued only with the approval of OMB to the extent required under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. For any standard form, except the 
SF-424 facesheet, Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the 
applicant to disregard any line item that is not needed.
    (4) When a grantee applies for additional funding (such as a 
continuation or supplemental award) or amends a previously submitted 
application, only the affected pages need be submitted. Previously 
submitted pages with information that is still current need not be 
resubmitted.


<R05>
Sec. 1183.11  State plans.

    (a) Scope. The statutes for some programs require States to submit 
plans before receiving grants. Under regulations implementing Executive 
Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' States 
are allowed to simplify, consolidate and substitute plans. This section 
contains additional provisions for plans that are subject to regulations 
implementing the Executive order.
    (b) Requirements. A State need meet only Federal administrative or 
programmatic requirements for a plan that are in statutes or codified 
regulations.
    (c) Assurances. In each plan the State will include an assurance 
that the State shall comply with all applicable Federal statutes and 
regulations in effect with respect to the periods for which it receives 
grant funding. For this assurance and other assurances required in the 
plan, the State may:
    (1) Cite by number the statutory or regulatory provisions requiring 
the assurances and affirm that it gives the assurances required by those 
provisions,
    (2) Repeat the assurance language in the statutes or regulations, or
    (3) Develop its own language to the extent permitted by law.
    (d) Amendments. A State will amend a plan whenever necessary to 
reflect: (1) New or revised Federal statutes or regulations or (2) a 
material change in any State law, organization, policy, or State agency 
operation. The State will obtain approval for the amendment and

[[Page 546]]

its effective date but need submit for approval only the amended 
portions of the plan.


<R05>
Sec. 1183.12  Special grant or subgrant conditions for ``high-risk'' grantees.

    (a) A grantee or subgrantee may be considered ``high risk'' if an 
awarding agency determines that a grantee or subgrantee:
    (1) Has a history of unsatisfactory performance, or
    (2) Is not financially stable, or
    (3) Has a management system which does not meet the management 
standards set forth in this part, or
    (4) Has not conformed to terms and conditions of previous awards, or
    (5) Is otherwise not responsible; and if the awarding agency 
determines that an award will be made, special conditions and/or 
restrictions shall correspond to the high risk condition and shall be 
included in the award.
    (b) Special conditions or restrictions may include:
    (1) Payment on a reimbursement basis;
    (2) Withholding authority to proceed to the next phase until receipt 
of evidence of acceptable performance within a given funding period;
    (3) Requiring additional, more detailed financial reports;
    (4) Additional project monitoring;
    (5) Requiring the grante or subgrantee to obtain technical or 
management assistance; or
    (6) Establishing additional prior approvals.
    (c) If an awarding agency decides to impose such conditions, the 
awarding official will notify the grantee or subgrantee as early as 
possible, in writing, of:
    (1) The nature of the special conditions/restrictions;
    (2) The reason(s) for imposing them;
    (3) The corrective actions which must be taken before they will be 
removed and the time allowed for completing the corrective actions and
    (4) The method of requesting reconsideration of the conditions/
restrictions imposed.


<R04>
                   Subpart C--Post-Award Requirements

                        Financial Administration


<R05>
Sec. 1183.20  Standards for financial management systems.

    (a) A State must expand and account for grant funds in accordance 
with State laws and procedures for expending and accounting for its own 
funds. Fiscal control and accounting procedures of the State, as well as 
its subgrantees and cost-type contractors, must be sufficient to--
    (1) Permit preparation of reports required by this part and the 
statutes authorizing the grant, and
    (2) Permit the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate 
to establish that such funds have not been used in violation of the 
restrictions and prohibitions of applicable statutes.
    (b) The financial management systems of other grantees and 
subgrantees must meet the following standards:
    (1) Financial reporting. Accurate, current, and complete disclosure 
of the financial results of financially assisted activities must be made 
in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the grant or 
subgrant.
    (2) Accounting records. Grantees and subgrantees must maintain 
records which adequately identify the source and application of funds 
provided for financially-assisted activities. These records must contain 
information pertaining to grant or subgrant awards and authorizations, 
obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays or 
expenditures, and income.
    (3) Internal control. Effective control and accountability must be 
maintained for all grant and subgrant cash, real and personal property, 
and other assets. Grantees and subgrantees must adequately safeguard all 
such property and must assure that it is used solely for authorized 
purposes.
    (4) Budget control. Actual expenditures or outlays must be compared 
with budgeted amounts for each grant or subgrant. Financial information

[[Page 547]]

must be related to performance or productivity data, including the 
development of unit cost information whenever appropriate or 
specifically required in the grant or subgrant agreement. If unit cost 
data are required, estimates based on available documentation will be 
accepted whenever possible.
    (5) Allowable cost. Applicable OMB cost principles, agency program 
regulations, and the terms of grant and subgrant agreements will be 
followed in determining the reasonableness, allowability, and 
allocability of costs.
    (6) Source documentation. Accounting records must be supported by 
such source documentation as cancelled checks, paid bills, payrolls, 
time and attendance records, contract and subgrant award documents, etc.
    (7) Cash management. Procedures for minimizing the time elapsing 
between the transfer of funds from the U.S. Treasury and disbursement by 
grantees and subgrantees must be followed whenever advance payment 
procedures are used. Grantees must establish reasonable procedures to 
ensure the receipt of reports on subgrantees' cash balances and cash 
disbursements in sufficient time to enable them to prepare complete and 
accurate cash transactions reports to the awarding agency. When advances 
are made by letter-of-credit or electronic transfer of funds methods, 
the grantee must make drawdowns as close as possible to the time of 
making disbursements. Grantees must monitor cash drawdowns by their 
subgrantees to assure that they conform substantially to the same 
standards of timing and amount as apply to advances to the grantees.
    (c) An awarding agency may review the adequacy of the financial 
management system of any applicant for financial assistance as part of a 
preaward review or at any time subsequent to award.


<R05>
Sec. 1183.21  Payment.

    (a) Scope. This section prescribes the basic standard and the 
methods under which a Federal agency will make payments to grantees, and 
grantees will make payments to subgrantees and contractors.
    (b) Basic standard. Methods and procedures for payment shall 
minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and 
disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee, in accordance with Treasury 
regulations at 31 CFR part 205.
    (c) Advances. Grantees and subgrantees shall be paid in advance, 
provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness and ability to 
maintain procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer 
of the funds and their disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee.
    (d) Reimbursement. Reimbursement shall be the preferred method when 
the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section are not met. Grantees 
and subgrantees may also be paid by reimbursement for any construction 
grant. Except as otherwise specified in regulation, Federal agencies 
shall not use the percentage of completion method to pay construction 
grants. The grantee or subgrantee may use that method to pay its 
construction contractor, and if it does, the awarding agency's payments 
to the grantee or subgrantee will be based on the grantee's or 
subgrantee's actual rate of disbursement.
    (e) Working capital advances. If a grantee cannot meet the criteria 
for advance payments described in paragraph (c) of this section, and the 
Federal agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because 
the grantee lacks sufficient working capital, the awarding agency may 
provide cash or a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure 
the awarding agency shall advance cash to the grantee to cover its 
estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to 
the grantee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the awarding agency shall 
reimburse the grantee for its actual cash disbursements. The working 
capital advance method of payment shall not be used by grantees or 
subgrantees if the reason for using such method is the unwillingness or 
inability of the grantee to provide timely advances to the subgrantee to 
meet the subgrantee's actual cash disbursements.
    (f) Effect of program income, refunds, and audit recoveries on 
payment. (1)

[[Page 548]]

Grantees and subgrantees shall disburse repayments to and interest 
earned on a revolving fund before requesting additional cash payments 
for the same activity.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, grantees 
and subgrantees shall disburse program income, rebates, refunds, 
contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds 
before requesting additional cash payments.
    (g) Withholding payments. (1) Unless otherwise required by Federal 
statute, awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper 
charges incurred by grantees or subgrantees unless--
    (i) The grantee or subgrantee has failed to comply with grant award 
conditions or
    (ii) The grantee or subgrantee is indebted to the United States.
    (2) Cash withheld for failure to comply with grant award condition, 
but without suspension of the grant, shall be released to the grantee 
upon subsequent compliance. When a grant is suspended, payment 
adjustments will be made in accordance with Sec. 1183.43(c).
    (3) A Federal agency shall not make payment to grantees for amounts 
that are withheld by grantees or subgrantees from payment to contractors 
to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payments shall be made by the 
Federal agency when the grantees or subgrantees actually disburse the 
withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to 
assure satisfactory completion of work.
    (h) Cash depositories. (1) Consistent with the national goal of 
expanding the opportunities for minority business enterprises, grantees 
and subgrantees are encouraged to use minority banks (a bank which is 
owned at least 50 percent by minority group members). A list of minority 
owned banks can be obtained from the Minority Business Development 
Agency, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230.
    (2) A grantee or subgrantee shall maintain a separate bank account 
only when required by Federal-State agreement.
    (i) Interest earned on advances. Except for interest earned on 
advances of funds exempt under the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 
U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) and the Indian Self-Determination Act (23 U.S.C. 
450), grantees and subgrantees shall promptly, but at least quarterly, 
remit interest earned on advances to the Federal agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee may keep interest amounts up to $100 per year for 
administrative expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 1183.22  Allowable costs.

    (a) Limitation on use of funds. Grant funds may be used only for:
    (1) The allowable costs of the grantees, subgrantees and cost-type 
contractors, including allowable costs in the form of payments to fixed-
price contractors; and
    (2) Reasonable fees or profit to cost-type contractors but not any 
fee or profit (or other increment above allowable costs) to the grantee 
or subgrantee.
    (b) Applicable cost principles. For each kind of organization, there 
is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. 
Allowable costs will be determined in accordance with the cost 
principles applicable to the organization incurring the costs. The 
following chart lists the kinds of organizations and the applicable cost 
principles.

<R05>
Sec. 1183.23  Period of availability of funds.

    (a) General. Where a funding period is specified, a grantee may 
charge to the award only costs resulting from obligations of the funding 
period unless carryover of unobligated balances is permitted, in which 
case the carryover balances may be charged for costs resulting from 
obligations of the subsequent funding period.

[[Page 549]]

    (b) Liquidation of obligations. A grantee must liquidate all 
obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 days after the 
end of the funding period (or as specified in a program regulation) to 
coincide with the submission of the annual Financial Status Report (SF-
269). The Federal agency may extend this deadline at the request of the 
grantee.


<R05>
Sec. 1183.24  Matching or cost sharing.

    (a) Basic rule: Costs and contributions acceptable. With the 
qualifications and exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, a 
matching or cost sharing requirement may be satisfied by either or both 
of the following:
    (1) Allowable costs incurred by the grantee, subgrantee or a cost-
type contractor under the assistance agreement. This includes allowable 
costs borne by non-Federal grants or by others cash donations from non-
Federal third parties.
    (2) The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to the 
period to which the cost sharing or matching requirements applies.
    (b) Qualifications and exceptions--(1) Costs borne by other Federal 
grant agreements. Except as provided by Federal statute, a cost sharing 
or matching requirement may not be met by costs borne by another Federal 
grant. This prohibition does not apply to income earned by a grantee or 
subgrantee from a contract awarded under another Federal grant.
    (2) General revenue sharing. For the purpose of this section, 
general revenue sharing funds distributed under 31 U.S.C. 6702 are not 
considered Federal grant funds.
    (3) Cost or contributions counted towards other Federal costs-
sharing requirements. Neither costs nor the values of third party in-
kind contributions may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or 
matching requirement of a grant agreement if they have been or will be 
counted towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of 
another Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement contract, or any 
other award of Federal funds.
    (4) Costs financed by program income. Costs financed by program 
income, as defined in Sec. 1183.25, shall not count towards satisfying a 
cost sharing or matching requirement unless they are expressly permitted 
in the terms of the assistance agreement. (This use of general program 
income is described in Sec. 1183.25(g).)
    (5) Services or property financed by income earned by contractors. 
Contractors under a grant may earn income from the activities carried 
out under the contract in addition to the amounts earned from the party 
awarding the contract. No costs of services or property supported by 
this income may count toward satisfying a cost sharing or matching 
requirement unless other provisions of the grant agreement expressly 
permit this kind of income to be used to meet the requirement.
    (6) Records. Costs and third party in-kind contributions counting 
towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement must be 
verifiable from the records of grantees and subgrantee or cost-type 
contractors. These records must show how the value placed on third party 
in-kind contributions was derived. To the extent feasible, volunteer 
services will be supported by the same methods that the organization 
uses to support the allocability of regular personnel costs.
    (7) Special standards for third party in-kind contributions. (i) 
Third party in-kind contributions count towards satisfying a cost 
sharing or matching requirement only where, if the party receiving the 
contributions were to pay for them, the payments would be allowable 
costs.
    (ii) Some third party in-kind contributions are goods and services 
that, if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor receiving the 
contribution had to pay for them, the payments would have been an 
indirect costs. Costs sharing or matching credit for such contributions 
shall be given only if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor has 
established, along with its regular indirect cost rate, a special rate 
for allocating to individual projects or programs the value of the 
contributions.
    (iii) A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed-price contract 
may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only 
if it results in:

[[Page 550]]

    (A) An increase in the services or property provided under the 
contract (without additional cost to the grantee or subgrantee) or
    (B) A cost savings to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (iv) The values placed on third party in-kind contributions for cost 
sharing or matching purposes will conform to the rules in the succeeding 
sections of this part. If a third party in-kind contribution is a type 
not treated in those sections, the value placed upon it shall be fair 
and reasonable.
    (c) Valuation of donated services--(1) Volunteer services. Unpaid 
services provided to a grantee or subgrantee by individuals will be 
valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work 
in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. If the grantee or 
subgrantee does not have employees performing similar work, the rates 
will be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for 
similar work in the same labor market. In either case, a reasonable 
amount for fringe benefits may be included in the valuation.
    (2) Employees of other organizations. When an employer other than a 
grantee, subgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge 
the services of an employee in the employee's normal line of work, the 
services will be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive 
of the employee's fringe benefits and overhead costs. If the services 
are in a different line of work, paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
applies.
    (d) Valuation of third party donated supplies and loaned equipment 
or space. (1) If a third party donates supplies, the contribution will 
be valued at the market value of the supplies at the time of donation.
    (2) If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a 
building but retains title, the contribution will be valued at the fair 
rental rate of the equipment or space.
    (e) Valuation of third party donated equipment, buildings, and land. 
If a third party donates equipment, buildings, or land, and title passes 
to a grantee or subgrantee, the treatment of the donated property will 
depend upon the purpose of the grant or subgrant, as follows:
    (1) Awards for capital expenditures. If the purpose of the grant or 
subgrant is to assist the grantee or subgrantee in the acquisition of 
property, the market value of that property at the time of donation may 
be counted as cost sharing or matching,
    (2) Other awards. If assisting in the acquisition of property is not 
the purpose of the grant or subgrant, paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of 
this section apply:
    (i) If approval is obtained from the awarding agency, the market 
value at the time of donation of the donated equipment or buildings and 
the fair rental rate of the donated land may be counted as cost sharing 
or matching. In the case of a subgrant, the terms of the grant agreement 
may require that the approval be obtained from the Federal agency as 
well as the grantee. In all cases, the approval may be given only if a 
purchase of the equipment or rental of the land would be approved as an 
allowable direct cost. If any part of the donated property was acquired 
with Federal funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be 
counted as cost-sharing or matching.
    (ii) If approval is not obtained under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this 
section, no amount may be counted for donated land, and only 
depreciation or use allowances may be counted for donated equipment and 
buildings. The depreciation or use allowances for this property are not 
treated as third party in-kind contributions. Instead, they are treated 
as costs incurred by the grantee or subgrantee. They are computed and 
allocated (usually as indirect costs) in accordance with the cost 
principles specified in Sec. 1183.22, in the same way as depreciation or 
use allowances for purchased equipment and buildings. The amount of 
depreciation or use allowances for donated equipment and buildings is 
based on the property's market value at the time it was donated.
    (f) Valuation of grantee or subgrantee donated real property for 
construction/acquisition. If a grantee or subgrantee donates real 
property for a construction or facilities acquisition project, the 
current market value of that property may be counted as cost sharing or 
matching. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal

[[Page 551]]

funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be counted as cost 
sharing or matching.
    (g) Appraisal of real property. In some cases under paragraphs (d), 
(e) and (f) of this section, it will be necessary to establish the 
market value of land or a building or the fair rental rate of land or of 
space in a building. In these cases, the Federal agency may require the 
market value or fair rental value be set by an independent appraiser, 
and that the value or rate be certified by the grantee. This requirement 
will also be imposed by the grantee on subgrantees.


<R05>
Sec. 1183.25  Program income.

    (a) General. Grantees are encouraged to earn income to defray 
program costs. Program income includes income from fees for services 
performed, from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired 
with grant funds, from the sale of commodities or items fabricated under 
a grant agreement, and from payments of principal and interest on loans 
made with grant funds. Except as otherwise provided in regulations of 
the Federal agency, program income does not include interest on grant 
funds, rebates, credits, discounts, refunds, etc. and interest earned on 
any of them.
    (b) Definition of program income. Program income means gross income 
received by the grantee or subgrantee directly generated by a grant 
supported activity, or earned only as a result of the grant agreement 
during the grant period. ``During the grant period'' is the time between 
the effective date of the award and the ending date of the award 
reflected in the final financial report.
    (c) Cost of generating program income. If authorized by Federal 
regulations or the grant agreement, costs incident to the generation of 
program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program 
income.
    (d) Governmental revenues. Taxes, special assessments, levies, 
fines, and other such revenues raised by a grantee or subgrantee are not 
program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the 
grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income.
    (e) Royalties. Income from royalties and license fees for 
copyrighted material, patents, and inventions developed by a grantee or 
subgrantee is program income only if the revenues are specifically 
identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as 
program income. (See Sec. 1183.34.)
    (f) Property. Proceeds from the sale of real property or equipment 
will be handled in accordance with the requirements of Secs. 1183.31 and 
1183.32.
    (g) Use of program income. Program income shall be deducted from 
outlays which may be both Federal and non-Federal as described below, 
unless the Federal agency regulations or the grant agreement specify 
another alternative (or a combination of the alternatives). In 
specifying alternatives, the Federal agency may distinguish between 
income earned by the grantee and income earned by subgrantees and 
between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income. When Federal agencies 
authorize the alternatives in paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) of this 
section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall also be 
deducted from outlays.
    (1) Deduction. Ordinarily program income shall be deducted from 
total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program 
income shall be used for current costs unless the Federal agency 
authorizes otherwise. Program income which the grantee did not 
anticipate at the time of the award shall be used to reduce the Federal 
agency and grantee contributions rather than to increase the funds 
committed to the project.
    (2) Addition. When authorized, program income may be added to the 
funds committed to the grant agreement by the Federal agency and the 
grantee. The program income shall be used for the purposes and under the 
conditions of the grant agreement.
    (3) Cost sharing or matching. When authorized, program income may be 
used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the grant 
agreement. The amount of the Federal grant award remains the same.
    (h) Income after the award period. There are no Federal requirements 
governing the disposition of program income earned after the end of the 
award

[[Page 552]]

period (i.e., until the ending date of the final financial report, see 
paragraph (a) of this section), unless the terms of the agreement or the 
Federal agency regulations provide otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 1183.26  Non-Federal audit.

    (a) Basic rule. Grantees and subgrantees are responsible for 
obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 
1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits of 
States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.'' The audits 
shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance with generally 
accepted government auditing standards covering financial audits.
    (b) Subgrantees. State or local governments, as those terms are 
defined for purposes of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, that 
provide Federal awards to a subgrantee, which expends $300,000 or more 
(or other amount as specified by OMB) in Federal awards in a fiscal 
year, shall:
    (1) Determine whether State or local subgrantees have met the audit 
requirements of the Act and whether subgrantees covered by OMB Circular 
A-110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements 
with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit 
Organizations,'' have met the audit requirements of the Act. Commercial 
contractors (private for-profit and private and governmental 
organizations) providing goods and services to State and local 
governments are not required to have a single audit performed. State and 
local governments should use their own procedures to ensure that the 
contractor has complied with laws and regulations affecting the 
expenditure of Federal funds;
    (2) Determine whether the subgrantee spent Federal assistance funds 
provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be 
accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subgrantee made in accordance 
with the Act, Circular A-110, or through other means (e.g., program 
reviews) if the subgrantee has not had such an audit;
    (3) Ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken within six 
months after receipt of the audit report in instance of noncompliance 
with Federal laws and regulations;
    (4) Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate adjustment of the 
grantee's own records; and
    (5) Require each subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have 
access to the records and financial statements.
    (c) Auditor selection. In arranging for audit services, Sec. 1183.36 
shall be followed.

[53 FR 8083, 8087, Mar. 11, 1988, as amended at 62 FR 45939, 45946, Aug. 
29, 1997]

                    Changes, Property, and Subawards


<R05>
Sec. 1183.30  Changes.

    (a) General. Grantees and subgrantees are permitted to rebudget 
within the approved direct cost budget to meet unanticipated 
requirements and may make limited program changes to the approved 
project. However, unless waived by the awarding agency, certain types of 
post-award changes in budgets and projects shall require the prior 
written approval of the awarding agency.
    (b) Relation to cost principles. The applicable cost principles (see 
Sec. 1183.22) contain requirements for prior approval of certain types 
of costs. Except where waived, those requirements apply to all grants 
and subgrants even if paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section do not.
    (c) Budget changes--(1) Nonconstruction projects. Except as stated 
in other regulations or an award document, grantees or subgrantees shall 
obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the 
following changes is anticipated under a nonconstruction award:
    (i) Any revision which would result in the need for additional 
funding.
    (ii) Unless waived by the awarding agency, cumulative transfers 
among direct cost categories, or, if applicable, among separately 
budgeted programs, projects, functions, or activities which exceed or 
are expected to exceed ten percent of the current total approved budget, 
whenever the awarding agency's share exceeds $100,000.
    (iii) Transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (i.e., from 
direct

[[Page 553]]

payments to trainees to other expense categories).
    (2) Construction projects. Grantees and subgrantees shall obtain 
prior written approval for any budget revision which would result in the 
need for additional funds.
    (3) Combined construction and nonconstruction projects. When a grant 
or subgrant provides funding for both construction and nonconstruction 
activities, the grantee or subgrantee must obtain prior written approval 
from the awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfer from 
nonconstruction to construction or vice versa.
    (d) Programmatic changes. Grantees or subgrantees must obtain the 
prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following 
actions is anticipated:
    (1) Any revision of the scope or objectives of the project 
(regardless of whether there is an associated budget revision requiring 
prior approval).
    (2) Need to extend the period of availability of funds.
    (3) Changes in key persons in cases where specified in an 
application or a grant award. In research projects, a change in the 
project director or principal investigator shall always require approval 
unless waived by the awarding agency.
    (4) Under nonconstruction projects, contracting out, subgranting (if 
authorized by law) or otherwise obtaining the services of a third party 
to perform activities which are central to the purposes of the award. 
This approval requirement is in addition to the approval requirements of 
Sec. 1183.36 but does not apply to the procurement of equipment, 
supplies, and general support services.
    (e) Additional prior approval requirements. The awarding agency may 
not require prior approval for any budget revision which is not 
described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) Requesting prior approval. (1) A request for prior approval of 
any budget revision will be in the same budget formal the grantee used 
in its application and shall be accompanied by a narrative justification 
for the proposed revision.
    (2) A request for a prior approval under the applicable Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 1183.22) may be made by letter.
    (3) A request by a subgrantee for prior approval will be addressed 
in writing to the grantee. The grantee will promptly review such request 
and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing. A grantee will 
not approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent with 
the purpose or terms and conditions of the Federal grant to the grantee. 
If the revision, requested by the subgrantee would result in a change to 
the grantee's approved project which requires Federal prior approval, 
the grantee will obtain the Federal agency's approval before approving 
the subgrantee's request.


<R05>
Sec. 1183.31  Real property.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to real property acquired under a grant or subgrant 
will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Use. Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes, real 
property will be used for the originally authorized purposes as long as 
needed for that purposes, and the grantee or subgrantee shall not 
dispose of or encumber its title or other interests.
    (c) Disposition. When real property is no longer needed for the 
originally authorized purpose, the grantee or subgrantee will request 
disposition instructions from the awarding agency. The instructions will 
provide for one of the following alternatives:
    (1) Retention of title. Retain title after compensating the awarding 
agency. The amount paid to the awarding agency will be computed by 
applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost 
of the original purchase to the fair market value of the property. 
However, in those situations where a grantee or subgrantee is disposing 
of real property acquired with grant funds and acquiring replacement 
real property under the same program, the net proceeds from the 
disposition may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement 
property.
    (2) Sale of property. Sell the property and compensate the awarding 
agency.

[[Page 554]]

The amount due to the awarding agency will be calculated by applying the 
awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the 
original purchase to the proceeds of the sale after deduction of any 
actual and reasonable selling and fixing-up expenses. If the grant is 
still active, the net proceeds from sale may be offset against the 
original cost of the property. When a grantee or subgrantee is directed 
to sell property, sales procedures shall be followed that provide for 
competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible 
return.
    (3) Transfer of title. Transfer title to the awarding agency or to a 
third-party designated/approved by the awarding agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the grantee or 
subgrantee's percentage of participation in the purchase of the real 
property to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 1183.32  Equipment.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) States. A State will use, manage, and dispose of equipment 
acquired under a grant by the State in accordance with State laws and 
procedures. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (c) 
through (e) of this section.
    (c) Use. (1) Equipment shall be used by the grantee or subgrantee in 
the program or project for which it was acquired as long as needed, 
whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by 
Federal funds. When no longer needed for the original program or 
project, the equipment may be used in other activities currently or 
previously supported by a Federal agency.
    (2) The grantee or subgrantee shall also make equipment available 
for use on other projects or programs currently or previously supported 
by the Federal Government, providing such use will not interfere with 
the work on the projects or program for which it was originally 
acquired. First preference for other use shall be given to other 
programs or projects supported by the awarding agency. User fees should 
be considered if appropriate.
    (3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in Sec. 1183.25(a) to earn 
program income, the grantee or subgrantee must not use equipment 
acquired with grant funds to provide services for a fee to compete 
unfairly with private companies that provide equivalent services, unless 
specifically permitted or contemplated by Federal statute.
    (4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the grantee or subgrantee 
may use the equipment to be replaced as a trade-in or sell the property 
and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement property, 
subject to the approval of the awarding agency.
    (d) Management requirements. Procedures for managing equipment 
(including replacement equipment), whether acquired in whole or in part 
with grant funds, until disposition takes place will, as a minimum, meet 
the following requirements:
    (1) Property records must be maintained that include a description 
of the property, a serial number or other identification number, the 
source of property, who holds title, the acquisition date, and cost of 
the property, percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the 
property, the location, use and condition of the property, and any 
ultimate disposition data including the date of disposal and sale price 
of the property.
    (2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken and the 
results reconciled with the property records at least once every two 
years.
    (3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards 
to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property. Any loss, damage, or 
theft shall be investigated.
    (4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the 
property in good condition.
    (5) If the grantee or subgrantee is authorized or required to sell 
the property, proper sales procedures must be established to ensure the 
highest possible return.
    (e) Disposition. When original or replacement equipment acquired 
under a grant or subgrant is no longer needed

[[Page 555]]

for the original project or program or for other activities currently or 
previously supported by a Federal agency, disposition of the equipment 
will be made as follows:
    (1) Items of equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of 
less than $5,000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no 
further obligation to the awarding agency.
    (2) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value in 
excess of $5,000 may be retained or sold and the awarding agency shall 
have a right to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market 
value or proceeds from sale by the awarding agency's share of the 
equipment.
    (3) In cases where a grantee or subgrantee fails to take appropriate 
disposition actions, the awarding agency may direct the grantee or 
subgrantee to take excess and disposition actions.
    (f) Federal equipment. In the event a grantee or subgrantee is 
provided federally-owned equipment:
    (1) Title will remain vested in the Federal Government.
    (2) Grantees or subgrantees will manage the equipment in accordance 
with Federal agency rules and procedures, and submit an annual inventory 
listing.
    (3) When the equipment is no longer needed, the grantee or 
subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the Federal 
agency.
    (g) Right to transfer title. The Federal awarding agency may reserve 
the right to transfer title to the Federal Government or a third part 
named by the awarding agency when such a third party is otherwise 
eligible under existing statutes. Such transfers shall be subject to the 
following standards:
    (1) The property shall be identified in the grant or otherwise made 
known to the grantee in writing.
    (2) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instruction 
within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the 
project for which it was acquired. If the Federal awarding agency fails 
to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar-day period the 
grantee shall follow Sec. 1183.32(e).
    (3) When title to equipment is transferred, the grantee shall be 
paid an amount calculated by applying the percentage of participation in 
the purchase to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 1183.33  Supplies.

    (a) Title. Title to supplies acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest, upon acquisition, in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Disposition. If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies 
exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate fair market value upon termination 
or completion of the award, and if the supplies are not needed for any 
other federally sponsored programs or projects, the grantee or 
subgrantee shall compensate the awarding agency for its share.


<R05>
Sec. 1183.34  Copyrights.

    The Federal awarding agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, 
and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish or otherwise use, and to 
authorize others to use, for Federal Government purposes:
    (a) The copyright in any work developed under a grant, subgrant, or 
contract under a grant or subgrant; and
    (b) Any rights of copyright to which a grantee, subgrantee or a 
contractor purchases ownership with grant support.

Sec. 1183.35  Subawards to debarred and suspended parties.

    Grantees and subgrantees must not make any award or permit any award 
(subgrant or contract) at any tier to any party which is debarred or 
suspended or is otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation 
in Federal assistance programs under Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment 
and Suspension.''


<R05>
Sec. 1183.36  Procurement.

    (a) States. When procuring property and services under a grant, a 
State will follow the same policies and procedures it uses for 
procurements from its non-Federal funds. The State will ensure that 
every purchase order or other contract includes any clauses required by 
Federal statutes and executive orders and their implementing 
regulations. Other grantees and subgrantees will

[[Page 556]]

follow paragraphs (b) through (i) in this section.
    (b) Procurement standards. (1) Grantees and subgrantees will use 
their own procurement procedures which reflect applicable State and 
local laws and regulations, provided that the procurements conform to 
applicable Federal law and the standards identified in this section.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a contract administration 
system which ensures that contractors perform in accordance with the 
terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase 
orders.
    (3) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a written code of 
standards of conduct governing the performance of their employees 
engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, 
officer or agent of the grantee or subgrantee shall participate in 
selection, or in the award or administration of a contract supported by 
Federal funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be 
involved. Such a conflict would arise when:
    (i) The employee, officer or agent,
    (ii) Any member of his immediate family,
    (iii) His or her partner, or
    (iv) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of 
the above, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for 
award. The grantee's or subgrantee's officers, employees or agents will 
neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary 
value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to 
subagreements. Grantee and subgrantees may set minimum rules where the 
financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item 
of nominal intrinsic value. To the extent permitted by State or local 
law or regulations, such standards or conduct will provide for 
penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of 
such standards by the grantee's and subgrantee's officers, employees, or 
agents, or by contractors or their agents. The awarding agency may in 
regulation provide additional prohibitions relative to real, apparent, 
or potential conflicts of interest.
    (4) Grantee and subgrantee procedures will provide for a review of 
proposed procurements to avoid purchase of unnecessary or duplicative 
items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out 
procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an 
analysis will be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any 
other appropriate analysis to determine the most economical approach.
    (5) To foster greater economy and efficiency, grantees and 
subgrantees are encouraged to enter into State and local 
intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common goods and 
services.
    (6) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use Federal excess 
and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property 
whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs.
    (7) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use value engineering 
clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to 
offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is 
a systematic and creative anaylsis of each contract item or task to 
ensure that its essential function is provided at the overall lower 
cost.
    (8) Grantees and subgrantees will make awards only to responsible 
contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the 
terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be 
given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public 
policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical 
resources.
    (9) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain records sufficient to 
detail the significant history of a procurement. These records will 
include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: rationale for 
the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor 
selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.
    (10) Grantees and subgrantees will use time and material type 
contracts only--
    (i) After a determination that no other contract is suitable, and
    (ii) If the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor 
exceeds at its own risk.

[[Page 557]]

    (11) Grantees and subgrantees alone will be responsible, in 
accordance with good administrative practice and sound business 
judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative 
issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not 
limited to source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. These 
standards do not relieve the grantee or subgrantee of any contractual 
responsibilities under its contracts. Federal agencies will not 
substitute their judgment for that of the grantee or subgrantee unless 
the matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be 
referred to the local, State, or Federal authority having proper 
jurisdiction.
    (12) Grantees and subgrantees will have protest procedures to handle 
and resolve disputes relating to their procurements and shall in all 
instances disclose information regarding the protest to the awarding 
agency. A protestor must exhaust all administrative remedies with the 
grantee and subgrantee before pursuing a protest with the Federal 
agency. Reviews of protests by the Federal agency will be limited to:
    (i) Violations of Federal law or regulations and the standards of 
this section (violations of State or local law will be under the 
jurisdiction of State or local authorities) and
    (ii) Violations of the grantee's or subgrantee's protest procedures 
for failure to review a complaint or protest. Protests received by the 
Federal agency other than those specified above will be referred to the 
grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Competition. (1) All procurement transactions will be conducted 
in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with the 
standards of Sec. 1183.36. Some of the situations considered to be 
restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:
    (i) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to 
qualify to do business,
    (ii) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding,
    (iii) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between 
affiliated companies,
    (iv) Noncompetitive awards to consultants that are on retainer 
contracts,
    (v) Organizational conflicts of interest,
    (vi) Specifying only a ``brand name'' product instead of allowing 
``an equal'' product to be offered and describing the performance of 
other relevant requirements of the procurement, and
    (vii) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will conduct procurements in a manner 
that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-
State or local geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or 
proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes 
expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing in this 
section preempts State licensing laws. When contracting for 
architectural and engineering (A/E) services, geographic location may be 
a selection criteria provided its application leaves an appropriate 
number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to 
compete for the contract.
    (3) Grantees will have written selection procedures for procurement 
transactions. These procedures will ensure that all solicitations:
    (i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical 
requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such 
description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features 
which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a 
statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service 
to be procured, and when necessary, shall set forth those minimum 
essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it 
is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should 
be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to 
make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a 
``brand name or equal'' description may be used as a means to define the 
performance or other salient requirements of a procurement. The specific 
features of the named brand which must be met by offerors shall be 
clearly stated; and
    (ii) Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and 
all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

[[Page 558]]

    (4) Grantees and subgrantees will ensure that all prequalified lists 
of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and 
services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure 
maximum open and free competition. Also, grantees and subgrantees will 
not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation 
period.
    (d) Methods of procurement to be followed--(1) Procurement by small 
purchase procedures. Small purchase procedures are those relatively 
simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, 
or other property that do not cost more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently set at $100,000). If 
small purchase procedures are used, price or rate quotations shall be 
obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.
    (2) Procurement by sealed bids (formal advertising). Bids are 
publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit 
price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with 
all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the 
lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for 
procuring construction, if the conditions in Sec. 1183.36(d)(2)(i) 
apply.
    (i) In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following 
conditions should be present:
    (A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase 
description is available;
    (B) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete 
effectively and for the business; and
    (C) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and 
the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the 
basis of price.
    (ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:
    (A) The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids 
shall be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing 
them sufficient time prior to the date set for opening the bids;
    (B) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications 
and pertinent attachments, shall define the items or services in order 
for the bidder to properly respond;
    (C) All bids will be publicly opened at the time and place 
prescribed in the invitation for bids;
    (D) A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing to the 
lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding 
documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life 
cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is lowest. 
Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior 
experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; 
and
    (E) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented 
reason.
    (3) Procurement by competitive proposals. The technique of 
competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source 
submitting an offer, and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type 
contract is awarded. It is generally used when conditions are not 
appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the 
following requirements apply:
    (i) Requests for proposals will be publicized and identify all 
evaluation factors and their relative importance. Any response to 
publicized requests for proposals shall be honored to the maximum extent 
practical;
    (ii) Proposals will be solicited from an adequate number of 
qualified sources;
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees will have a method for conducting 
technical evaluations of the proposals received and for selecting 
awardees;
    (iv) Awards will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is 
most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors 
considered; and
    (v) Grantees and subgrantees may use competitive proposal procedures 
for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) 
professional services whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated 
and the most qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of 
fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as 
a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional 
services. It cannot be used to purchase other types

[[Page 559]]

of services though A/E firms are a potential source to perform the 
proposed effort.
    (4) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals is procurement through 
solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or after solicitation 
of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.
    (i) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used only when 
the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase procedures, 
sealed bids or competitive proposals and one of the following 
circumstances applies:
    (A) The item is available only from a single source;
    (B) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not 
permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation;
    (C) The awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive proposals; or
    (D) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is 
determined inadequate.
    (ii) Cost analysis, i.e., verifying the proposed cost data, the 
projections of the data, and the evaluation of the specific elements of 
costs and profits, is required.
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees may be required to submit the 
proposed procurement to the awarding agency for pre-award review in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (e) Contracting with small and minority firms, women's business 
enterprise and labor surplus area firms. (1) The grantee and subgrantee 
will take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority firms, 
women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when 
possible.
    (2) Affirmative steps shall include:
    (i) Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women's 
business enterprises on solicitation lists;
    (ii) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women's 
business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources;
    (iii) Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into 
smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small and 
minority business, and women's business enterprises;
    (iv) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, 
which encourage participation by small and minority business, and 
women's business enterprises;
    (v) Using the services and assistance of the Small Business 
Administration, and the Minority Business Development Agency of the 
Department of Commerce; and
    (vi) Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, 
to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through 
(v) of this section.
    (f) Contract cost and price. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must 
perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement 
action including contract modifications. The method and degree of 
analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular 
procurement situation, but as a starting point, grantees must make 
independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. A cost 
analysis must be performed when the offeror is required to submit the 
elements of his estimated cost, e.g., under professional, consulting, 
and architectural engineering services contracts. A cost analysis will 
be necessary when adequate price competition is lacking, and for sole 
source procurements, including contract modifications or change orders, 
unless price resonableness can be established on the basis of a catalog 
or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities 
to the general public or based on prices set by law or regulation. A 
price analysis will be used in all other instances to determine the 
reasonableness of the proposed contract price.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will negotiate profit as a separate 
element of the price for each contract in which there is no price 
competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To 
establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration will be given to 
the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the 
contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, 
the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates 
in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.

[[Page 560]]

    (3) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under 
grants will be allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost 
estimates included in negotiated prices are consistent with Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 1183.22). Grantees may reference their own cost 
principles that comply with the applicable Federal cost principles.
    (4) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of 
construction cost methods of contracting shall not be used.
    (g) Awarding agency review. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must make 
available, upon request of the awarding agency, technical specifications 
on proposed procurements where the awarding agency believes such review 
is needed to ensure that the item and/or service specified is the one 
being proposed for purchase. This review generally will take place prior 
to the time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation 
document. However, if the grantee or subgrantee desires to have the 
review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the 
awarding agency may still review the specifications, with such review 
usually limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees must on request make available for 
awarding agency pre-award review procurement documents, such as requests 
for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc. 
when:
    (i) A grantee's or subgrantee's procurement procedures or operation 
fails to comply with the procurement standards in this section; or
    (ii) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold and is to be awarded without competition or only 
one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation; or
    (iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product; or
    (iv) The proposed award is more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold and is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder 
under a sealed bid procurement; or
    (v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract 
or increases the contract amount by more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold.
    (3) A grantee or subgrantee will be exempt from the pre-award review 
in paragraph (g)(2) of this section if the awarding agency determines 
that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this section.
    (i) A grantee or subgrantee may request that its procurement system 
be reviewed by the awarding agency to determine whether its system meets 
these standards in order for its system to be certified. Generally, 
these reviews shall occur where there is a continuous high-dollar 
funding, and third-party contracts are awarded on a regular basis.
    (ii) A grantee or subgrantee may self-certify its procurement 
system. Such self-certification shall not limit the awarding agency's 
right to survey the system. Under a self-certification procedure, 
awarding agencies may wish to rely on written assurances from the 
grantee or subgrantee that it is complying with these standards. A 
grantee or subgrantee will cite specific procedures, regulations, 
standards, etc., as being in compliance with these requirements and have 
its system available for review.
    (h) Bonding requirements. For construction or facility improvement 
contracts or subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition 
threshold, the awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and 
requirements of the grantee or subgrantee provided the awarding agency 
has made a determination that the awarding agency's interest is 
adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the 
minimum requirements shall be as follows:
    (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of 
the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist of a firm commitment 
such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument 
accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of 
his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within 
the time specified.
    (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent 
of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is

[[Page 561]]

one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all 
the contractor's obligations under such contract.
    (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of 
the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed in connection 
with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons 
supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for 
in the contract.
    (i) Contract provisions. A grantee's and subgrantee's contracts must 
contain provisions in paragraph (i) of this section. Federal agencies 
are permitted to require changes, remedies, changed conditions, access 
and records retention, suspension of work, and other clauses approved by 
the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.
    (1) Administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances 
where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such 
sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate. (Contracts more than the 
simplified acquisition threshold)
    (2) Termination for cause and for convenience by the grantee or 
subgrantee including the manner by which it will be effected and the 
basis for settlement. (All contracts in excess of $10,000)
    (3) Compliance with Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, 
entitled ``Equal Employment Opportunity,'' as amended by Executive Order 
11375 of October 13, 1967, and as supplemented in Department of Labor 
regulations (41 CFR chapter 60). (All construction contracts awarded in 
excess of $10,000 by grantees and their contractors or subgrantees)
    (4) Compliance with the Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 U.S.C. 
874) as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 3). 
(All contracts and subgrants for construction or repair)
    (5) Compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a to 276a-7) 
as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). 
(Construction contracts in excess of $2000 awarded by grantees and 
subgrantees when required by Federal grant program legislation)
    (6) Compliance with Sections 103 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours 
and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-330) as supplemented by 
Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). (Construction contracts 
awarded by grantees and subgrantees in excess of $2000, and in excess of 
$2500 for other contracts which involve the employment of mechanics or 
laborers)
    (7) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining to reporting.
    (8) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining to patent rights with respect to any discovery or invention 
which arises or is developed in the course of or under such contract.
    (9) Awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to 
copyrights and rights in data.
    (10) Access by the grantee, the subgrantee, the Federal grantor 
agency, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their 
duly authorized representatives to any books, documents, papers, and 
records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to that specific 
contract for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and 
transcriptions.
    (11) Retention of all required records for three years after 
grantees or subgrantees make final payments and all other pending 
matters are closed.
    (12) Compliance with all applicable standards, orders, or 
requirements issued under section 306 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 
1857(h)), section 508 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1368), Executive 
Order 11738, and Environmental Protection Agency regulations (40 CFR 
part 15). (Contracts, subcontracts, and subgrants of amounts in excess 
of $100,000)
    (13) Mandatory standards and policies relating to energy efficiency 
which are contained in the state energy conservation plan issued in 
compliance with the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (Pub. L. 94-163, 
89 Stat. 871).

<R05>
Sec. 1183.37  Subgrants.

    (a) States. States shall follow state law and procedures when 
awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a

[[Page 562]]

cost reimbursement or fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to 
local and Indian tribal governments. States shall:
    (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by 
Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations;
    (2) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon 
them by Federal statute and regulation;
    (3) Ensure that a provision for compliance with Sec. 1183.42 is 
placed in every cost reimbursement subgrant; and
    (4) Conform any advances of grant funds to subgrantees substantially 
to the same standards of timing and amount that apply to cash advances 
by Federal agencies.
    (b) All other grantees. All other grantees shall follow the 
provisions of this part which are applicable to awarding agencies when 
awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or 
fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal 
governments. Grantees shall:
    (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes a provision for compliance 
with this part;
    (2) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by 
Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations; 
and
    (3) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon 
them by Federal statutes and regulations.
    (c) Exceptions. By their own terms, certain provisions of this part

    (4) Section 1183.50.

              Reports, Records, Retention, and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 1183.40  Monitoring and reporting program performance.

    (a) Monitoring by grantees. Grantees are responsible for managing 
the day-to-day operations of grant and subgrant supported activities. 
Grantees must monitor grant and subgrant supported activities to assure 
compliance with applicable Federal requirements and that performance 
goals are being achieved. Grantee monitoring must cover each program, 
function or activity.
    (b) Nonconstruction performance reports. The Federal agency may, if 
it decides that performance information available from subsequent 
applications contains sufficient information to meet its programmatic 
needs, require the grantee to submit a performance report only upon 
expiration or termination of grant support. Unless waived by the Federal 
agency this report will be due on the same date as the final Financial 
Status Report.
    (1) Grantees shall submit annual performance reports unless the 
awarding agency requires quarterly or semi-annual reports. However, 
performance reports will not be required more frequently than quarterly. 
Annual reports shall be due 90 days after the grant year, quarterly or 
semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The 
final performance report will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support. If a justified request is submitted by a 
grantee, the Federal agency may extend the due date for any performance 
report. Additionally, requirements for unnecessary performance reports 
may be waived by the Federal agency.
    (2) Performance reports will contain, for each grant, brief 
information on the following:
    (i) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives 
established for the period. Where the output of the project can be 
quantified, a computation of the cost per unit of output may be required 
if that information will be useful.
    (ii) The reasons for slippage if established objectives were not 
met.
    (iii) Additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, 
analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
    (3) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of performance reports.

[[Page 563]]

    (4) Grantees will adhere to the standards in this section in 
prescribing performance reporting requirements for subgrantees.
    (c) Construction performance reports. For the most part, on-site 
technical inspections and certified percentage-of-completion data are 
relied on heavily by Federal agencies to monitor progress under 
construction grants and subgrants. The Federal agency will require 
additional formal performance reports only when considered necessary, 
and never more frequently than quarterly.
    (d) Significant developments. Events may occur between the scheduled 
performance reporting dates which have significant impact upon the grant 
or subgrant supported activity. In such cases, the grantee must inform 
the Federal agency as soon as the following types of conditions become 
known:
    (1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially 
impair the ability to meet the objective of the award. This disclosure 
must include a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any 
assistance needed to resolve the situation.
    (2) Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and 
objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more 
beneficial results than originally planned.
    (e) Federal agencies may make site visits as warranted by program 
needs.
    (f) Waivers, extensions. (1) Federal agencies may waive any 
performance report required by this part if not needed.
    (2) The grantee may waive any performance report from a subgrantee 
when not needed. The grantee may extend the due date for any performance 
report from a subgrantee if the grantee will still be able to meet its 
performance reporting obligations to the Federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1183.41  Financial reporting.

    (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (5) of 
this section, grantees will use only the forms specified in paragraphs 
(a) through (e) of this section, and such supplementary or other forms 
as may from time to time be authorized by OMB, for:
    (i) Submitting financial reports to Federal agencies, or
    (ii) Requesting advances or reimbursements when letters of credit 
are not used.
    (2) Grantees need not apply the forms prescribed in this section in 
dealing with their subgrantees. However, grantees shall not impose more 
burdensome requirements on subgrantees.
    (3) Grantees shall follow all applicable standard and supplemental 
Federal agency instructions approved by OMB to the extend required under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 for use in connection with forms 
specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. Federal 
agencies may issue substantive supplementary instructions only with the 
approval of OMB. Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the grantee 
to disregard any line item that the Federal agency finds unnecessary for 
its decisionmaking purposes.
    (4) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of forms required under this part.
    (5) Federal agencies may provide computer outputs to grantees to 
expedite or contribute to the accuracy of reporting. Federal agencies 
may accept the required information from grantees in machine usable 
format or computer printouts instead of prescribed forms.
    (6) Federal agencies may waive any report required by this section 
if not needed.
    (7) Federal agencies may extend the due date of any financial report 
upon receiving a justified request from a grantee.
    (b) Financial Status Report--(1) Form. Grantees will use Standard 
Form 269 or 269A, Financial Status Report, to report the status of funds 
for all nonconstruction grants and for construction grants when required 
in accordance with paragraph Sec. 1183.41(e)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (2) Accounting basis. Each grantee will report program outlays and 
program income on a cash or accrual basis as prescribed by the awarding 
agency. If the Federal agency requires accrual information and the 
grantee's accounting records are not normally kept on the accural basis, 
the grantee shall not be

[[Page 564]]

required to convert its accounting system but shall develop such accrual 
information through and analysis of the documentation on hand.
    (3) Frequency. The Federal agency may prescribe the frequency of the 
report for each project or program. However, the report will not be 
required more frequently than quarterly. If the Federal agency does not 
specify the frequency of the report, it will be submitted annually. A 
final report will be required upon expiration or termination of grant 
support.
    (4) Due date. When reports are required on a quarterly or semiannual 
basis, they will be due 30 days after the reporting period. When 
required on an annual basis, they will be due 90 days after the grant 
year. Final reports will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support.
    (c) Federal Cash Transactions Report--(1) Form. (i) For grants paid 
by letter or credit, Treasury check advances or electronic transfer of 
funds, the grantee will submit the Standard Form 272, Federal Cash 
Transactions Report, and when necessary, its continuation sheet, 
Standard Form 272a, unless the terms of the award exempt the grantee 
from this requirement.
    (ii) These reports will be used by the Federal agency to monitor 
cash advanced to grantees and to obtain disbursement or outlay 
information for each grant from grantees. The format of the report may 
be adapted as appropriate when reporting is to be accomplished with the 
assistance of automatic data processing equipment provided that the 
information to be submitted is not changed in substance.
    (2) Forecasts of Federal cash requirements. Forecasts of Federal 
cash requirements may be required in the ``Remarks'' section of the 
report.
    (3) Cash in hands of subgrantees. When considered necessary and 
feasible by the Federal agency, grantees may be required to report the 
amount of cash advances in excess of three days' needs in the hands of 
their subgrantees or contractors and to provide short narrative 
explanations of actions taken by the grantee to reduce the excess 
balances.
    (4) Frequency and due date. Grantees must submit the report no later 
than 15 working days following the end of each quarter. However, where 
an advance either by letter of credit or electronic transfer of funds is 
authorized at an annualized rate of one million dollars or more, the 
Federal agency may require the report to be submitted within 15 working 
days following the end of each month.
    (d) Request for advance or reimbursement--(1) Advance payments. 
Requests for Treasury check advance payments will be submitted on 
Standard Form 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. (This form will 
not be used for drawdowns under a letter of credit, electronic funds 
transfer or when Treasury check advance payments are made to the grantee 
automatically on a predetermined basis.)
    (2) Reimbursements. Requests for reimbursement under nonconstruction 
grants will also be submitted on Standard Form 270. (For reimbursement 
requests under construction grants, see paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section.)
    (3) The frequency for submitting payment requests is treated in 
Sec. 1183.41(b)(3).
    (e) Outlay report and request for reimbursement for construction 
programs. (1) Grants that support construction activities paid by 
reimbursement method.
    (i) Requests for reimbursement under construction grants will be 
submitted on Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Federal agencies may, however, 
prescribe the Request for Advance or Reimbursement form, specified in 
Sec. 1183.41(d), instead of this form.
    (ii) The frequency for submitting reimbursement requests is treated 
in Sec. 1183.41(b)(3).
    (2) Grants that support construction activities paid by letter of 
credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advance.
    (i) When a construction grant is paid by letter of credit, 
electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advances, the grantee will 
report its outlays to the Federal agency using Standard Form 271, Outlay 
Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The 
Federal agency will provide any necessary special instruction.

[[Page 565]]

However, frequency and due date shall be governed by Sec. 1183.41(b) (3) 
and (4).
    (ii) When a construction grant is paid by Treasury check advances 
based on periodic requests from the grantee, the advances will be 
requested on the form specified in Sec. 1183.41(d).
    (iii) The Federal agency may substitute the Financial Status Report 
specified in Sec. 1183.41(b) for the Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs.
    (3) Accounting basis. The accounting basis for the Outlay Report and 
Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs shall be governed by 
Sec. 1183.41(b)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 1183.42  Retention and access requirements for records.

    (a) Applicability. (1) This section applies to all financial and 
programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and 
other records of grantees or subgrantees which are:
    (i) Required to be maintained by the terms of this part, program 
regulations or the grant agreement, or
    (ii) Otherwise reasonably considered as pertinent to program 
regulations or the grant agreement.
    (2) This section does not apply to records maintained by contractors 
or subcontractors. For a requirement to place a provision concerning 
records in certain kinds of contracts, see Sec. 1183.36(i)(10).
    (b) Length of retention period. (1) Except as otherwise provided, 
records must be retained for three years from the starting date 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action 
involving the records has been started before the expiration of the 3-
year period, the records must be retained until completion of the action 
and resolution of all issues which arise from it, or until the end of 
the regular 3-year period, whichever is later.
    (3) To avoid duplicate recordkeeping, awarding agencies may make 
special arrangements with grantees and subgrantees to retain any records 
which are continuously needed for joint use. The awarding agency will 
request transfer of records to its custody when it determines that the 
records possess long-term retention value. When the records are 
transferred to or maintained by the Federal agency, the 3-year retention 
requirement is not applicable to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Starting date of retention period--(1) General. When grant 
support is continued or renewed at annual or other intervals, the 
retention period for the records of each funding period starts on the 
day the grantee or subgrantee submits to the awarding agency its single 
or last expenditure report for that period. However, if grant support is 
continued or renewed quarterly, the retention period for each year's 
records starts on the day the grantee submits its expenditure report for 
the last quarter of the Federal fiscal year. In all other cases, the 
retention period starts on the day the grantee submits its final 
expenditure report. If an expenditure report has been waived, the 
retention period starts on the day the report would have been due.
    (2) Real property and equipment records. The retention period for 
real property and equipment records starts from the date of the 
disposition or replacement or transfer at the direction of the awarding 
agency.
    (3) Records for income transactions after grant or subgrant support. 
In some cases grantees must report income after the period of grant 
support. Where there is such a requirement, the retention period for the 
records pertaining to the earning of the income starts from the end of 
the grantee's fiscal year in which the income is earned.
    (4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. This 
paragraph applies to the following types of documents, and their 
supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost 
allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at 
which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage 
chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).
    (i) If submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or other 
computation is required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to 
the grantee) to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-
year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of 
such submission.

[[Page 566]]

    (ii) If not submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or 
other computation is not required to be submitted to the Federal 
Government (or to the grantee) for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year 
retention period for the proposal plan, or computation and its 
supporting records starts from end of the fiscal year (or other 
accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.
    (d) Substitution of microfilm. Copies made by microfilming, 
photocopying, or similar methods may be substituted for the original 
records.
    (e) Access to records--(1) Records of grantees and subgrantees. The 
awarding agency and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any 
of their authorized representatives, shall have the right of access to 
any pertinent books, documents, papers, or other records of grantees and 
subgrantees which are pertinent to the grant, in order to make audits, 
examinations, excerpts, and transcripts.
    (2) Expiration of right of access. The rights of access in this 
section must not be limited to the required retention period but shall 
last as long as the records are retained.
    (f) Restrictions on public access. The Federal Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) does not apply to records Unless required 
by Federal, State, or local law, grantees and subgrantees are not 
required to permit public access to their records.


<R05>
Sec. 1183.43  Enforcement.

    (a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a grantee or subgrantee 
materially fails to comply with any term of an award, whether stated in 
a Federal statute or regulation, an assurance, in a State plan or 
application, a notice of award, or elsewhere, the awarding agency may 
take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the 
circumstances:
    (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the 
deficiency by the grantee or subgrantee or more severe enforcement 
action by the awarding agency,
    (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and matching credit 
for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in 
compliance,
    (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award for the 
grantee's or subgrantee's program,
    (4) Withhold further awards for the program, or
    (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.
    (b) Hearings, appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the awarding 
agency will provide the grantee or subgrantee an opportunity for such 
hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the grantee 
or subgrantee is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to 
the action involved.
    (c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of grantee or 
subgrantee resulting from obligations incurred by the grantee or 
subgrantee during a suspension or after termination of an award are not 
allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the 
notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other grantee or 
subgrantee costs during suspension or after termination which are 
necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if:
    (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred 
by the grantee or subgrantee before the effective date of suspension or 
termination, are not in anticipation of it, and, in the case of a 
termination, are noncancellable, and,
    (2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or 
expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the 
termination takes effect.
    (d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement 
remedies identified in this section, including suspension and 
termination, do not preclude grantee or subgrantee from being subject to 
``Debarment and Suspension'' under E.O. 12549 (see Sec. 1183.35).


<R05>
Sec. 1183.44  Termination for convenience.

    Except as provided in Sec. 1183.43 awards may be terminated in whole 
or in part only as follows:
    (a) By the awarding agency with the consent of the grantee or 
subgrantee in which case the two parties shall agree upon the 
termination conditions, including the effective date and in the case of 
partial termination, the portion to be terminated, or

[[Page 567]]

    (b) By the grantee or subgrantee upon written notification to the 
awarding agency, setting forth the reasons for such termination, the 
effective date, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to 
be terminated. However, if, in the case of a partial termination, the 
awarding agency determines that the remaining portion of the award will 
not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, the awarding 
agency may terminate the award in its entirety under either Sec. 1183.43 
or paragraph (a) of this section.


<R04>
                 Subpart D--After-the-Grant Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 1183.50  Closeout.

    (a) General. The Federal agency will close out the award when it 
determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required 
work of the grant has been completed.
    (b) Reports. Within 90 days after the expiration or termination of 
the grant, the grantee must submit all financial, performance, and other 
reports required as a condition of the grant. Upon request by the 
grantee, Federal agencies may extend this timeframe. These may include 
but are not limited to:
    (1) Final performance or progress report.
    (2) Financial Status Report (SF 269) or Outlay Report and Request 
for Reimbursement for Construction Programs (SF-271) (as applicable).
    (3) Final request for payment (SF-270) (if applicable).
    (4) Invention disclosure (if applicable).
    (5) Federally-owned property report:

In accordance with Sec. 1183.32(f), a grantee must submit an inventory 
of all federally owned property (as distinct from property acquired with 
grant funds) for which it is accountable and request disposition 
instructions from the Federal agency of property no longer needed.
    (c) Cost adjustment. The Federal agency will, within 90 days after 
receipt of reports in paragraph (b) of this section, make upward or 
downward adjustments to the allowable costs.
    (d) Cash adjustments. (1) The Federal agency will make prompt 
payment to the grantee for allowable reimbursable costs.
    (2) The grantee must immediately refund to the Federal agency any 
balance of unobligated (unencumbered) cash advanced that is not 
authorized to be retained for use on other grants.


<R05>
Sec. 1183.51  Later disallowances and adjustments.

    The closeout of a grant does not affect:
    (a) The Federal agency's right to disallow costs and recover funds 
on the basis of a later audit or other review;
    (b) The grantee's obligation to return any funds due as a result of 
later refunds, corrections, or other transactions;
    (c) Records retention as required in Sec. 1183.42;
    (d) Property management requirements in Secs. 1183.31 and 1183.32; 
and
    (e) Audit requirements in Sec. 1183.26.


<R05>
Sec. 1183.52  Collection of amounts due.

    (a) Any funds paid to a grantee in excess of the amount to which the 
grantee is finally determined to be entitled under the terms of the 
award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a 
reasonable period after demand, the Federal agency may reduce the debt 
by:
    (1) Making an adminstrative offset against other requests for 
reimbursements,
    (2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the grantee, or
    (3) Other action permitted by law.
    (b) Except where otherwise provided by statutes or regulations, the 
Federal agency will charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance 
with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR Ch. II). The date 
from which interest is computed is not extended by litigation or the 
filing of any form of appeal.

<R05>
Sec. 1185.100  Purpose.

    (a) Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 provides that, to the extent 
permitted by law, Executive departments and agencies shall participate 
in a governmentwide system for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. 
A person who is debarred or suspended shall be excluded from Federal 
financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under Federal 
programs and activities. Debarment or suspension of a participant in a 
program by one agency shall have governmentwide effect.
    (b) These regulations implement section 3 of E.O. 12549 and the 
guidelines promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget under 
section 6 of the E.O. by:

[[Page 569]]

    (1) Prescribing the programs and activities that are covered by the 
governmentwide system;
    (2) Prescribing the governmentwide criteria and governmentwide 
minimum due process procedures that each agency shall use;
    (3) Providing for the listing of debarred and suspended 
participants, participants declared ineligible (see definition of 
``ineligible'' in Sec. 1185.105), and participants who have voluntarily 
excluded themselves from participation in covered transactions;
    (4) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, 
determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion; and
    (5) Offering such other guidance as necessary for the effective 
implementation and administration of the governmentwide system.
    (c) These regulations also implement Executive Order 12689 (3 CFR, 
1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Public Law 103-355, sec. 
2455, 108 Stat. 3327) by--
    (1) Providing for the inclusion in the List of Parties Excluded from 
Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs all persons proposed for 
debarment, debarred or suspended under the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation, 48 CFR Part 9, subpart 9.4; persons against which 
governmentwide exclusions have been entered under this part; and persons 
determined to be ineligible; and
    (2) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, 
determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion.
    (d) Although these regulations cover the listing of ineligible 
participants and the effect of such listing, they do not prescribe 
policies and procedures governing declarations of ineligibility.

<R05>
Sec. 1185.110  Coverage.

    (a) These regulations apply to all persons who have participated, 
are currently participating or may reasonably be expected to participate 
in transactions under Federal nonprocurement programs. For purposes of 
these regulations such transactions will be referred to as ``covered 
transactions.''
    (1) Covered transaction. For purposes of these regulations, a 
covered transaction is a primary covered transaction or a lower tier 
covered transaction. Covered transactions at any tier need not involve 
the transfer of Federal funds.
    (i) Primary covered transaction. Except as noted in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section, a primary covered transaction is any nonprocurement 
transaction between an agency and a person, regardless of type, 
including: grants, cooperative agreements, scholarships, fellowships, 
contracts of assistance, loans, loan guarantees, subsidies, insurance, 
payments for specified use, donation agreements and any other 
nonprocurement transactions between a Federal agency and a person. 
Primary covered transactions also include those transactions specially 
designated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in 
such agency's regulations governing debarment and suspension.
    (ii) Lower tier covered transaction. A lower tier covered 
transaction is:
    (A) Any transaction between a participant and a person other than a 
procurement contract for goods or services, regardless of type, under a 
primary covered transaction.
    (B) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a 
participant and a person, regardless of type, expected to equal or 
exceed the Federal procurement small purchase threshold fixed at 10 
U.S.C. 2304(g) and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) (currently $25,000) under a primary 
covered transaction.
    (C) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a 
participant and a person under a covered transaction, regardless of 
amount, under which that person will have a critical influence on or 
substantive control over that covered transaction. Such persons are:
    (1) Principal investigators.
    (2) Providers of federally required audit services.
    (2) Exceptions. The following transactions are not covered:
    (i) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier 
awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including 
deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;
    (ii) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international 
organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign 
government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, entities 
consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities;
    (iii) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without 
regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received 
in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);
    (iv) Federal employment;
    (v) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized 
emergencies or disasters;
    (vi) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental 
operations; and
    (vii) Other transactions where the application of these regulations 
would be prohibited by law.
    (b) Relationship to other sections. This section describes the types 
of transactions to which a debarment or suspension under the regulations 
will apply. Subpart B, ``Effect of Action,'' Sec. 1185.200, ``Debarment 
or suspension,'' sets forth the consequences of a debarment or 
suspension. Those consequences would obtain only with respect to 
participants and principals in the covered transactions and activities 
described in Sec. 1185.110(a). Sections 1185.325, ``Scope of 
debarment,'' and 1185.420, ``Scope of suspension,'' govern the extent to 
which a specific participant or organizational elements of a

[[Page 572]]

participant would be automatically included within a debarment or 
suspension action, and the conditions under which affiliates or persons 
associated with a participant may also be brought within the scope of 
the action.
    (c) Relationship to Federal procurement activities. In accordance 
with E.O. 12689 and section 2455 of Public Law 103-355, any debarment, 
suspension, proposed debarment or other governmentwide exclusion 
initiated under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) on or after 
August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for Executive 
Branch agencies and participants as an exclusion under this regulation. 
Similarly, any debarment, suspension or other governmentwide exclusion 
initiated under this regulation on or after August 25, 1995 shall be 
recognized by and effective for those agencies as a debarment or 
suspension under the FAR.

<R05>
Sec. 1185.115  Policy.

    (a) In order to protect the public interest, it is the policy of the 
Federal Government to conduct business only with responsible persons. 
Debarment and suspension are discretionary actions that, taken in 
accordance with Executive Order 12549 and these regulations, are 
appropriate means to implement this policy.
    (b) Debarment and suspension are serious actions which shall be used 
only in the public interest and for the Federal Government's protection 
and not for purposes of punishment. Agencies may impose debarment or 
suspension for the causes and in accordance with the procedures set 
forth in these regulations.
    (c) When more than one agency has an interest in the proposed 
debarment or suspension of a person, consideration shall be given to 
designating one agency as the lead agency for making the decision. 
Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for 
coordinating their debarment or suspension actions.

throughout the Executive Branch of the Federal Government for the period 
of their debarment, suspension, or the period they are proposed for 
debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4. Accordingly, no agency shall 
enter into primary covered transactions with such excluded persons 
during such period, except as permitted pursuant to Sec. 1185.215.
    (b) Lower tier covered transactions. Except to the extent prohibited 
by law, persons who have been proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 
9, subpart 9.4, debarred or suspended shall be excluded from 
participating as either participants or principals in all lower tier 
covered transactions (see Sec. 1185.110(a)(1)(ii)) for the period of 
their exclusion.
    (c) Exceptions. Debarment or suspension does not affect a person's 
eligibility for--
    (1) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier 
awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including 
deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;
    (2) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international 
organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign 
government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, and 
entities consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or 
foreign governmental entities;
    (3) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without 
regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received 
in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);
    (4) Federal employment;
    (5) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized 
emergencies or disasters;
    (6) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental 
operations; and

Sec. 1185.205  Ineligible persons.

    Persons who are ineligible, as defined in Sec. 1185.105(i), are 
excluded in accordance with the applicable statutory, executive order, 
or regulatory authority.


<R05>
Sec. 1185.210  Voluntary exclusion.

    Persons who accept voluntary exclusions under Sec. 1185.315 are 
excluded in accordance with the terms of their settlements. IMS shall, 
and participants may, contact the original action agency to ascertain 
the extent of the exclusion.


<R05>
Sec. 1185.215  Exception provision.

    IMS may grant an exception permitting a debarred, suspended, or 
voluntarily excluded person, or a person proposed for debarment under 48 
CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, to participate in a particular covered 
transaction upon a written determination by the agency head or an 
authorized designee stating the reason(s) for deviating from the 
Presidential policy established by Executive Order 12549 and 
Sec. 1185.200. However, in accordance with the President's stated 
intention in the Executive Order, exceptions shall be granted only 
infrequently. Exceptions shall be reported in accordance with 
Sec. 1185.505(a).

<R05>
Sec. 1185.220  Continuation of covered transactions.

    (a) Notwithstanding the debarment, suspension, proposed debarment 
under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, determination of ineligibility, or 
voluntary exclusion of any person by an agency, agencies and 
participants may continue covered transactions in existence at the time 
the person was debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR 
part 9, subpart 9.4, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded. A 
decision as to the type of termination action, if any, to be taken 
should be made only after thorough review to ensure the propriety of the 
proposed action.
    (b) Agencies and participants shall not renew or extend covered 
transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any person who is 
debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 
9.4, ineligible or voluntary excluded, except as provided in 
Sec. 1185.215.

<R05>
Sec. 1185.225  Failure to adhere to restrictions.

    (a) Except as permitted under Sec. 1185.215 or Sec. 1185.220, a 
participant shall not knowingly do business under a covered transaction 
with a person who is--
    (1) Debarred or suspended;
    (2) Proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; or
    (3) Ineligible for or voluntarily excluded from the covered 
transaction.
    (b) Violation of the restriction under paragraph (a) of this section 
may result in disallowance of costs, annulment or termination of award, 
issuance of a stop work order, debarment or suspension, or other 
remedies as appropriate.
    (c) A participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective 
participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it and its 
principals are not debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 
CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the 
covered transaction (See Appendix B of these regulations), unless it 
knows that the certification is erroneous. An agency has the burden of 
proof that a participant did knowingly do business with a person that 
filed an erroneous certification.

                          Subpart C--Debarment


<R05>
Sec. 1185.300  General.

    The debarring official may debar a person for any of the causes in 
Sec. 1185.305, using procedures established in Secs. 1185.310 through 
1185.314. The existence of a cause for debarment, however, does not 
necessarily require that the person be debarred; the seriousness of the 
person's acts or omissions and

[[Page 574]]

any mitigating factors shall be considered in making any debarment 
decision.


<R05>
Sec. 1185.305  Causes for debarment.

    Debarment may be imposed in accordance with the provisions of 
Secs. 1185.300 through 1185.314 for:

    (c) Any of the following causes:
    (1) A nonprocurement debarment by any Federal agency taken before 
October 1, 1988, the effective date of these regulations, or a

subpart 9.4;
    (2) Knowingly doing business with a debarred, suspended, ineligible,

<R05>
Sec. 1185.310  Procedures.

    IMS shall process debarment actions as informally as practicable, 
consistent with the principles of fundamental fairness, using the 
procedures in Secs. 1185.311 through 1185.314.


<R05>
Sec. 1185.311  Investigation and referral.

    Information concerning the existence of a cause for debarment from 
any source shall be promptly reported, investigated, and referred, when 
appropriate, to the debarring official for consideration. After 
consideration, the debarring official may issue a notice of proposed 
debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 1185.312  Notice of proposed debarment.

    A debarment proceeding shall be initiated by notice to the 
respondent advising:
    (a) That debarment is being considered;
    (b) Of the reasons for the proposed debarment in terms sufficient to 
put the respondent on notice of the conduct or transaction(s) upon which 
it is based;
    (c) Of the cause(s) relied upon under Sec. 1185.305 for proposing 
debarment;
    (d) Of the provisions of Sec. 1185.311 through Sec. 1185.314, and 
any other IMS

[[Page 575]]

procedures, if applicable, governing debarment decisionmaking; and
    (e) Of the potential effect of a debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 1185.313  Opportunity to contest proposed debarment.

    (a) Submission in opposition. Within 30 days after receipt of the 
notice of proposed debarment, the respondent may submit, in person, in 
writing, or through a representative, information and argument in 
opposition to the proposed debarment.
    (b) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. (1) In 
actions not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, if the debarring 
official finds that the respondent's submission in opposition raises a 
genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment, 
respondent(s) shall be afforded an opportunity to appear with a 
representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and 
confront any witness the agency presents.
    (2) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be made 
available at cost to the respondent, upon request, unless the respondent 
and the agency, by mutual agreement, waive the requirement for a 
transcript.


<R05>
Sec. 1185.314  Debarring official's decision.

    (a) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions based upon a 
conviction or civil judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute 
over material facts, the debarring official shall make a decision on the 
basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any 
submission made by the respondent. The decision shall be made within 45 
days after receipt of any information and argument submitted by the 
respondent, unless the debarring official extends this period for good 
cause.
    (b) Additional proceedings necessary. (1) In actions in which 
additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material 
facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared. The debarring 
official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with 
any information and argument submitted by the respondent and any other 
information in the administrative record.
    (2) The debarring official may refer disputed material facts to 
another official for findings of fact. The debarring official may reject 
any such findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically 
determining them to be arbitrary and capricious or clearly erroneous.
    (3) The debarring official's decision shall be made after the 
conclusion of the proceedings with respect to disputed facts.
    (c)(1) Standard of proof. In any debarment action, the cause for 
debarment must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. Where 
the proposed debarment is based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the 
standard shall be deemed to have been met.
    (2) Burden of proof. The burden of proof is on the agency proposing 
debarment.
    (d) Notice of debarring official's decision. (1) If the debarring 
official decides to impose debarment, the respondent shall be given 
prompt notice:
    (i) Referring to the notice of proposed debarment;
    (ii) Specifying the reasons for debarment;
    (iii) Stating the period of debarment, including effective dates; 
and
    (iv) Advising that the debarment is effective for covered 
transactions throughout the executive branch of the Federal Government 
unless an agency head or an authorized designee makes the determination 
referred to in Sec. 1185.215.
    (2) If the debarring official decides not to impose debarment, the 
respondent shall be given prompt notice of that decision. A decision not 
to impose debarment shall be without prejudice to a subsequent 
imposition of debarment by any other agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1185.315  Settlement and voluntary exclusion.

    (a) When in the best interest of the Government, IMS may, at any 
time, settle a debarment or suspension action.
    (b) If a participant and the agency agree to a voluntary exclusion 
of the participant, such voluntary exclusion shall be entered on the 
Nonprocurement List (see subpart E).

[[Page 576]]


<R05>
Sec. 1185.320  Period of debarment.

    (a) Debarment shall be for a period commensurate with the 
seriousness of the cause(s). If a suspension precedes a debarment, the 
suspension period shall be considered in determining the debarment 
period.
    (1) Debarment for causes other than those related to a violation of 
the requirements of subpart F of this part generally should not exceed 
three years. Where circumstances warrant, a longer period of debarment 
may be imposed.
    (2) In the case of a debarment for a violation of the requirements 
of subpart F of this part (see 1185.305(c)(5)), the period of debarment 
shall not exceed five years.
    (b) The debarring official may extend an existing debarment for an 
additional period, if that official determines that an extension is 
necessary to protect the public interest. However, a debarment may not 
be extended solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon 
which the initial debarment action was based. If debarment for an 
additional period is determined to be necessary, the procedures of 
Secs. 1185.311 through 1185.314 shall be followed to extend the 
debarment.
    (c) The respondent may request the debarring official to reverse the 
debarment decision or to reduce the period or scope of debarment. Such a 
request shall be in writing and supported by documentation. The 
debarring official may grant such a request for reasons including, but 
not limited to:
    (1) Newly discovered material evidence;
    (2) Reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which the 
debarment was based;
    (3) Bona fide change in ownership or management;
    (4) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; 
or
    (5) Other reasons the debarring official deems appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 1185.325  Scope of debarment.

    (a) Scope in general. (1) Debarment of a person under these 
regulations constitutes debarment of all its divisions and other 
organizational elements from all covered transactions, unless the 
debarment decision is limited by its terms to one or more specifically 
identified individuals, divisions or other organizational elements or to 
specific types of transactions.
    (2) The debarment action may include any affiliate of the 
participant that is specifically named and given notice of the proposed 
debarment and an opportunity to respond (see Secs. 1185.311 through 
1185.314).
    (b) Imputing conduct. For purposes of determining the scope of 
debarment, conduct may be imputed as follows:
    (1) Conduct imputed to participant. The fraudulent, criminal or 
other seriously improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, 
partner, employee, or other individual associated with a participant may 
be imputed to the participant when the conduct occurred in connection 
with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of the 
participant, or with the participant's knowledge, approval, or 
acquiescence. The participant's acceptance of the benefits derived from 
the conduct shall be evidence of such knowledge, approval, or 
acquiescence.
    (2) Conduct imputed to individuals associated with participant. The 
fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of a 
participant may be imputed to any officer, director, shareholder, 
partner, employee, or other individual associated with the participant 
who participated in, knew of, or had reason to know of the participant's 
conduct.
    (3) Conduct of one participant imputed to other participants in a 
joint venture. The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper 
conduct of one participant in a joint venture, grant pursuant to a joint 
application, or similar arrangement may be imputed to other participants 
if the conduct occurred for or on behalf of the joint venture, grant 
pursuant to a joint application, or similar arrangement may be imputed 
to other participants if the conduct occurred for or on behalf of the 
joint venture, grant pursuant to a joint application, or similar 
arrangement or with the knowledge, approval, or acquiescence of these 
participants. Acceptance

[[Page 577]]

of the benefits derived from the conduct shall be evidence of such 
knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.

                          Subpart D--Suspension


<R05>
Sec. 1185.400  General.

    (a) The suspending official may suspend a person for any of the 
causes in Sec. 1185.405 using procedures established in Secs. 1185.410 
through 1185.413.
    (b) Suspension is a serious action to be imposed only when:
    (1) There exists adequate evidence of one or more of the causes set 
out in Sec. 1185.405, and
    (2) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.
    (c) In assessing the adequacy of the evidence, the agency should 
consider how much information is available, how credible it is given the 
circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, 
and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. This assessment 
should include an examination of basic documents such as grants, 
cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, and contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 1185.405  Causes for suspension.

    (a) Suspension may be imposed in accordance with the provisions of 
Secs. 1185.400 through 1185.413 upon adequate evidence:
    (1) To suspect the commission of an offense listed in 
Sec. 1185.305(a); or
    (2) That a cause for debarment under Sec. 1185.305 may exist.
    (b) Indictment shall constitute adequate evidence for purposes of 
suspension actions.


<R05>
Sec. 1185.410  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral. Information concerning the existence 
of a cause for suspension from any source shall be promptly reported, 
investigated, and referred, when appropriate, to the suspending official 
for consideration. After consideration, the suspending official may 
issue a notice of suspension.
    (b) Decisionmaking process. IMS shall process suspension actions as 
informally as practicable, consistent with principles of fundamental 
fairness, using the procedures in Sec. 1185.411 through Sec. 1185.413.

    When a respondent is suspended, notice shall immediately be given:
    (a) That suspension has been imposed;
    (b) That the suspension is based on an indictment, conviction, or 
other adequate evidence that the respondent has committed irregularities 
seriously reflecting on the propriety of further Federal Government 
dealings with the respondent;
    (c) Describing any such irregularities in terms sufficient to put 
the respondent on notice without disclosing the Federal Government's 
evidence;
    (d) Of the cause(s) relied upon under Sec. 1185.405 for imposing 
suspension;
    (e) That the suspension is for a temporary period pending the 
completion of an investigation or ensuing legal, debarment, or Program 
Fraud Civil Remedies Act proceedings;
    (f) Of the provisions of Secs. 1185.411 through 1185.413 and any

    (a) Submission in opposition. Within 30 days after receipt of the 
notice of suspension, the respondent may submit, in person, in writing, 
or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to 
the suspension.
    (b) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. (1) If the 
suspending official finds that the respondent's submission in opposition 
raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension, 
respondent(s) shall be afforded an opportunity to appear with a 
representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and 
confront any witness the agency presents, unless:
    (i) The action is based on an indictment, conviction or civil 
judgment, or
    (ii) A determination is made, on the basis of Department of Justice 
advice, that the substantial interests of the Federal Government in 
pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on

[[Page 578]]

the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced.

requirement for a transcript.


<R05>
Sec. 1185.413  Suspending official's decision.

    The suspending official may modify or terminate the suspension (for 
example, see Sec. 1185.320(c) for reasons for reducing the period or 
scope of debarment) or may leave it in force. However, a decision to 
modify or terminate the suspension shall be without prejudice to the 
subsequent imposition of suspension by any other agency or debarment by 
any agency. The decision shall be rendered in accordance with the 
following provisions:
    (a) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions: based on an 
indictment, conviction, or civil judgment; in which there is no genuine 
dispute over material facts; or in which additional proceedings to 
determine disputed material facts have been denied on the basis of 
Department of Justice advice, the suspending official shall make a 
decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative 
record, including any submission made by the respondent. The decision 
shall be made within 45 days after receipt of any information and 
argument submitted by the respondent, unless the suspending official 
extends this period for good cause.
    (b) Additional proceedings necessary. (1) In actions in which 
additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material 
facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared. The suspending 
official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with 
any information and argument submitted by the respondent and any other 
information in the administrative record.
    (2) The suspending official may refer matters involving disputed 
material facts to another official for findings of fact. The suspending 
official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after 
specifically determining them to be arbitrary or capricious or clearly 
erroneous.
    (c) Notice of suspending official's decision. Prompt written notice 
of the suspending official's decision shall be sent to the respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 1185.415  Period of suspension.

    (a) Suspension shall be for a temporary period pending the 
completion of an investigation or ensuing legal, debarment, or Program 
Fraud Civil Remedies Act proceedings, unless terminated sooner by the 
suspending official or as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) If legal or administrative proceedings are not initiated within 
12 months after the date of the suspension notice, the suspension shall 
be terminated unless an Assistant Attorney General or United States 
Attorney requests its extension in writing, in which case it may be 
extended for an additional six months. In no event may a suspension 
extend beyond 18 months, unless such proceedings have been initiated 
within that period.
    (c) The suspending official shall notify the Department of Justice 
of an impending termination of a suspension, at least 30 days before the 
12-month period expires, to give that Department an opportunity to 
request an extension.


<R05>
Sec. 1185.420  Scope of suspension.

    The scope of a suspension is the same as the scope of a debarment 
(see Sec. 1185.325), except that the procedures of Secs. 1185.410 
through 1185.413 shall be used in imposing a suspension.

suspended, or voluntarily excluded by agencies under Executive Order 
12549 and these regulations, and those who have been determined to be 
ineligible.
    (b) At a minimum, this list shall indicate:
    (1) The names and addresses of all debarred, suspended, ineligible, 
and voluntarily excluded persons, in alphabetical order, with cross-

    (a) The agency shall provide GSA with current information concerning 
debarments, suspension, determinations of ineligibility, and voluntary 
exclusions it has taken. Until February 18, 1989, the agency shall also 
provide GSA and OMB with information concerning all transactions in 
which IMS has granted exceptions under Sec. 1185.215 permitting 
participation by debarred, suspended, or voluntarily excluded persons.
    (b) Unless an alternative schedule is agreed to by GSA, the agency 
shall advise GSA of the information set forth in Sec. 1185.500(b) and of 
the exceptions granted under Sec. 1185.215 within five working days 
after taking such actions.
    (c) The agency shall direct inquiries concerning listed persons to 
the agency that took the action.
    (d) IMS officials shall check the Nonprocurement List before 
entering covered transactions to determine whether a participant in a 
primary transaction is debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily 
excluded (Tel. ).
    (e) IMS officials shall check the Nonprocurement List before 
approving principals or lower tier participants where agency approval of 
the principal or lower tier participant is required under the terms of 
the transaction, to determine whether such principals or participants 
are debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded.


<R05>
Sec. 1185.510  Participants' responsibilities.

    (a) Certification by participants in primary covered transactions. 
Each participant shall submit the certification in Appendix A to this 
part for it and its principals at the time the participant submits its 
proposal in connection with a primary covered transaction, except that 
States need only complete such certification as to their principals. 
Participants may decide the method and frequency by which they determine 
the eligibility of their principals. In addition, each participant may, 
but is not required to, check the Nonprocurement List for its principals 
(Tel. ). Adverse information on the certification will not necessarily 
result in denial of participation. However, the certification, and any 
additional information pertaining to the certification submitted by the 
participant, shall be considered in the administration of covered 
transactions.
    (b) Certification by participants in lower tier covered 
transactions. (1) Each participant shall require participants in lower 
tier covered transactions to include the certification in Appendix B to 
this part for it and its principals in any proposal submitted in 
connection with such lower tier covered transactions.
    (2) A participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective 
participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it and its 
principals are not debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily 
excluded from the covered transaction by any Federal agency, unless it 
knows that the certification is erroneous. Participants may decide the 
method and frequency by which they determine the eligiblity of their 
principals. In addition, a participant may, but is not required to, 
check the Nonprocurement List for its principals and for participants 
(Tel. ).
    (c) Changed circumstances regarding certification. A participant 
shall provide immediate written notice to IMS if at any time the 
participant learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted 
or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. Participants 
in lower tier covered transactions shall provide the same updated notice 
to the participant to which it submitted its proposals.

shall make a one-time drug-free workplace certification for a non-
automatic continuation of

[[Page 582]]

such a grant made on or after March 18, 1989.

one-time certification in order to continue receiving awards.
    (c) A grantee that is a State may elect to make one certification in 
each Federal fiscal year. States that previously submitted an annual 
certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 
1990 until June 30, 1990. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, this certification shall cover all grants to all State agencies 
from any Federal agency. The State shall retain the original of this

award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with respect 
to each grant, unless the Federal agency has designated a central 
location for submission.
    (d)(1) The Governor of a State may exclude certain State agencies 
from the statewide certification and authorize these agencies to submit 
their own certifications to Federal agencies. The statewide 
certification shall name any State agencies so excluded.
    (2) A State agency to which the statewide certification does not 
apply, or a State agency in a State that does not have a statewide 
certification, may elect to make one certification in each Federal 
fiscal year. State agencies that previously submitted a State agency 
certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 
1990 until June 30, 1990. The State agency shall retain the original of 
this State agency-wide certification in its central office and, prior to 
grant award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with 
respect to each grant, unless the Federal agency designates a central 
location for submission.
    (3) When the work of a grant is done by more than one State agency, 
the certification of the State agency directly receiving the grant shall 
be deemed to certify compliance for all workplaces, including those 
located in other State agencies.
    (e)(1) For a grant of less than 30 days performance duration, 
grantees shall have this policy statement and program in place as soon 
as possible, but in any case by a date prior to the date on which 
performance is expected to be completed.
    (2) For a grant of 30 days or more performance duration, grantees 
shall have this policy statement and program in place within 30 days 
after award.
    (3) Where extraordinary circumstances warrant for a specific grant, 
the grant officer may determine a different date on which the policy 
statement and program shall be in place.


<R05>
Sec. 1185.635  Reporting of and employee sanctions for convictions of criminal drug offenses.

    (a) When a grantee other than an individual is notified that an

occurring in the workplace, it shall take the following actions:
    (1) Within 10 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, 
the grantee shall provide written notice, including the convicted 
employee's position title, to every grant officer, or other designee on 
whose grant activity the convicted employee was working, unless a 
Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt of such 
notifications. Notification shall include the identification number(s) 
for each of the Federal agency's affected grants.
    (2) Within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, 
the grantee shall do the following with respect to the employee who was 
convicted.
    (i) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to 
and including termination, consistent with requirements of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; or
    (ii) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug 
abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by 
a Federal, State, or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate 
agency.
    (b) A grantee who is an individual who is convicted for a violation 
of a criminal drug statute occurring during the conduct of any grant 
activity shall

[[Page 583]]

report the conviction, in writing, within 10 calendar days, to his or 
her Federal agency grant officer, or other designee, unless the Federal 
agency has designated a central point for the receipt of such notices. 
Notification shall include the identification number(s) for each of the 
Federal agency's affected grants.

Appendix A to Part 1185--Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, 
     and Other Responsibility Matters--Primary Covered Transactions

                     Instructions for Certification

    1. By signing and submitting this proposal, the prospective primary 
participant is providing the certification set out below.
    2. The inability of a person to provide the certification required 
below will not necessarily result in denial of participation in this 
covered transaction. The prospective participant shall submit an 
explanation of why it cannot provide the certification set out below. 
The certification or explanation will be considered in connection with 
the department or agency's determination whether to enter into this 
transaction. However, failure of the prospective primary participant to 
furnish a certification or an explanation shall disqualify such person 
from participation in this transaction.
    3. The certification in this clause is a material representation of 
fact upon which reliance was placed when the department or agency 
determined to enter into this transaction. If it is later determined 
that the prospective primary participant knowingly rendered an erroneous 
certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal 
Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for 
cause or default.
    4. The prospective primary participant shall provide immediate 
written notice to the department or agency to which this proposal is 
submitted if at any time the prospective primary participant learns that 
its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous 
by reason of changed circumstances.
    5. The terms covered transaction, debarred, suspended, ineligible, 
lower tier covered transaction, participant, person, primary covered 
transaction, principal, proposal, and voluntarily excluded, as used in 
this clause, have the meanings set out in the Definitions and Coverage 
sections of the rules implementing Executive Order 12549. You may 
contact the department or agency to which this proposal is being 
submitted for assistance in obtaining a copy of those regulations.
    6. The prospective primary participant agrees by submitting this 
proposal that, should the proposed covered transaction be entered into, 
it shall not knowingly enter into any lower tier covered transaction 
with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 
9.4, debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded 
from participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized by the 
department or agency entering into this transaction.
    7. The prospective primary participant further agrees by submitting 
this proposal that it will include the clause titled ``Certification 
Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion-
Lower Tier Covered Transaction,'' provided by the department or agency 
entering into this covered transaction, without modification, in all 
lower tier covered transactions and in all solicitations for lower tier 
covered transactions.

certification of a prospective participant in a lower tier covered 
transaction that it is not proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, 
subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded 
from the covered transaction, unless it knows that the certification is 
erroneous. A participant may decide the method and frequency by which it 
determines the eligibility of its principals. Each participant may, but 
is not required to, check the List of Parties Excluded from Federal 
Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.
    9. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require 
establishment of a system of records in order to render in good faith 
the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and information 
of a participant is not required to exceed that which is normally 
possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business 
dealings.
    10. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 6 of these 
instructions, if a participant in a covered transaction knowingly enters 
into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for 
debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, suspended, debarred, 
ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this 
transaction, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal 
Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for 
cause or default.

is not required to, check the List of Parties Excluded from Federal 
Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.
    8. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require 
establishment of a system of records in order to render in good faith 
the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and information 
of a participant is not required to exceed that which is normally 
possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business 
dealings.
    9. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 5 of these 
instructions, if a participant in a covered transaction knowingly enters 
into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for 
debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, suspended, debarred, 
ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this 
transaction, in addition to other remedies available to the

[[Page 585]]

Federal Government, the department or agency with which this transaction 
originated may pursue available remedies, including suspension and/or 
debarment.

    Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility an 
          Voluntary Exclusion--Lower Tier Covered Transactions

    (1) The prospective lower tier participant certifies, by submission 
of this proposal, that neither it nor its principals is presently 
debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or 
voluntarily excluded from participation in this transaction by any 
Federal department or agency.
    (2) Where the prospective lower tier participant is unable to 
certify to any of the statements in this certification, such prospective 
participant shall attach an explanation to this proposal.

  Appendix C to Part 1185--Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace 
                              Requirements

                     Instructions for Certification

    1. By signing and/or submitting this application or grant agreement, 
the grantee is providing the certification set out below.
    2. The certification set out below is a material representation of 
fact upon which reliance is placed when the agency awards the grant. If 
it is later determined that the grantee knowingly rendered a false 
certification, or otherwise violates the requirements of the Drug-Free 
Workplace Act, the agency, in addition to any other remedies available 
to the Federal Government, may take action authorized under the Drug-
Free Workplace Act.
    3. For grantees other than individuals, Alternate I applies.
    4. For grantees who are individuals, Alternate II applies.
    5. Workplaces under grants, for grantees other than individuals, 
need not be identified on the certification. If known, they may be 
identified in the grant application. If the grantee does not identify 
the workplaces at the time of application, or upon award, if there is no 
application, the grantee must keep the identity of the workplace(s) on 
file in its office and make the information available for Federal 
inspection. Failure to identify all known workplaces constitutes a 
violation of the grantee's drug-free workplace requirements.
    6. Workplace identifications must include the actual address of 
buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the 
grant takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (e.g., all 
vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while 
in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, 
performers in concert halls or radio studios).
    7. If the workplace identified to the agency changes during the 
performance of the grant, the grantee shall inform the agency of the 
change(s), if it previously identified the workplaces in question (see 
paragraph five).
    8. Definitions of terms in the Nonprocurement Suspension and 
Debarment common rule and Drug-Free Workplace common rule apply to this 
certification. Grantees' attention is called, in particular, to the 
following definitions from these rules:
    Controlled substance means a controlled substance in Schedules I 
through V of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812) and as 
further defined by regulation (21 CFR 1308.11 through 1308.15);
    Conviction means a finding of guilt (including a plea of nolo 
contendere) or imposition of sentence, or both, by any judicial body 
charged with the responsibility to determine violations of the Federal 
or State criminal drug statutes;
    Criminal drug statute means a Federal or non-Federal criminal 
statute involving the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, use, or 
possession of any controlled substance;
    Employee means the employee of a grantee directly engaged in the 
performance of work under a grant, including: (i) All direct charge 
employees; (ii) All indirect charge employees unless their impact or 
involvement is insignificant to the performance of the grant; and, (iii) 
Temporary personnel and consultants who are directly engaged in the 
performance of work under the grant and who are on the grantee's 
payroll. This definition does not include workers not on the payroll of 
the grantee (e.g., volunteers, even if used to meet a matching 
requirement; consultants or independent contractors not on the grantee's 
payroll; or employees of subrecipients or subcontractors in covered 
workplaces).

        Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace Requirements

             Alternate I. (Grantees Other Than Individuals)

    A. The grantee certifies that it will or will continue to provide a 
drug-free workplace by:
    (a) Publishing a statement notifying employees that the unlawful 
manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a 
controlled substance is prohibited in the grantee's workplace and 
specifying the actions that will be taken against employees for 
violation of such prohibition;
    (b) Establishing an ongoing drug-free awareness program to inform 
employees about--
    (1) The dangers of drug abuse in the workplace;

[[Page 586]]

    (2) The grantee's policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace;
    (3) Any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee 
assistance programs; and
    (4) The penalties that may be imposed upon employees for drug abuse 
violations occurring in the workplace;
    (c) Making it a requirement that each employee to be engaged in the 
performance of the grant be given a copy of the statement required by 
paragraph (a);
    (d) Notifying the employee in the statement required by paragraph 
(a) that, as a condition of employment under the grant, the employee 
will--
    (1) Abide by the terms of the statement; and
    (2) Notify the employer in writing of his or her conviction for a 
violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace no later 
than five calendar days after such conviction;
    (e) Notifying the agency in writing, within ten calendar days after 
receiving notice under paragraph (d)(2) from an employee or otherwise 
receiving actual notice of such conviction. Employers of convicted 
employees must provide notice, including position title, to every grant 
officer or other designee on whose grant activity the convicted employee 
was working, unless the Federal agency has designated a central point 
for the receipt of such notices. Notice shall include the identification 
number(s) of each affected grant;
    (f) Taking one of the following actions, within 30 calendar days of 
receiving notice under paragraph (d)(2), with respect to any employee 
who is so convicted--
    (1) Taking appropriate personnel action against such an employee, up 
to and including termination, consistent with the requirements of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; or
    (2) Requiring such employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug 
abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by 
a Federal, State, or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate 
agency;
    (g) Making a good faith effort to continue to maintain a drug-free 
workplace through implementation of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) 
and (f).
    B. The grantee may insert in the space provided below the site(s) 
for the performance of work done in connection with the specific grant:

Place of Performance (Street address, city, county, state, zip code)
 _______________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________

Check {time}  if there are workplaces on file that are not identified 
here.

              Alternate II. (Grantees Who Are Individuals)

    (a) The grantee certifies that, as a condition of the grant, he or 
she will not engage in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, 
dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance in conducting 
any activity with the grant;
    (b) If convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a 
violation occurring during the conduct of any grant activity, he or she 
will report the conviction, in writing, within 10 calendar days of the 
conviction, to every grant officer or other designee, unless the Federal 
agency designates a central point for the receipt of such notices. When 
notice is made to such a central point, it shall include the 
identification number(s) of each affected grant.
