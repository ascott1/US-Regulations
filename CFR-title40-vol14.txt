S8092

I11The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas. 
I11Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows: 
Q02
I37Title 1 through Title 16 Las of January 1 

I37Title 17 through Title 27 Las of April 1 

I37Title 28 through Title 41 Las of July 1 

I37Title 42 through Title 50 Las of October 1 

I11The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume. 
Q02

I10LEGAL STATUS 
Q02

I11The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510). 

Q02

S8092


I10HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS 
Q02

I11The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule. 

I11To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 1996), consult the ``List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule. 
Q02

I10EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES 
Q02

I11Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
Q02

I10OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
Q02

I11The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96�09511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. �vi�Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements. 
Q02

I10OBSOLETE PROVISIONS 
Q02

I11Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949�091963, 1964�091972, or 1973�091985, published in seven separate volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. 
Q02

I10INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE 
Q02

I11T3What is incorporation by reference? T1Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law. 

I11T3What is a proper incorporation by reference? T1The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are: 

I11(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register. 

I11(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process. 

I11(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51. 

I11Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume. 

I11T3What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? T1If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 20408, or call (202) 523�094534. 
Q02

I10CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES 
Q02

I11A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR T4Index and Finding Aids. T1This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume. 

I11An index to the text of ``Title 3_The President'' is carried within that volume.

I11The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in the daily Federal Register. 

�vii�I11A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles. 
Q02

I10REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
Q02

I11There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.
Q02

I10INQUIRIES  
Q02

I11For a legal interpretation or explanation of any regulation in this volume, contact the issuing agency. The issuing agency's name appears at the top of odd�09numbered pages.

I11For inquiries concerning CFR reference assistance, call 202�09523�095227 or write to the Director, Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, DC 20408.

<R05>
Sec. 300.1  Purpose and objectives.

    The purpose of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution 
Contingency Plan (NCP) is to provide the organizational structure and 
procedures for preparing for and responding to discharges of oil and 
releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants.


<R05>
Sec. 300.2  Authority and applicability.

    The NCP is required by section 105 of the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, 42 
U.S.C. 9605, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization 
Act of 1986 (SARA), Pub. L. 99-499, (hereinafter CERCLA), and by section 
311(d) of the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. 1321(d), as amended by 
the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), Pub. L. 101-380. In Executive Order 
(E.O.) 12777 (56 FR 54757, October 22, 1991), the President delegated to 
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the responsibility for the 
amendment of the NCP. Amendments to the NCP are coordinated with members 
of the National Response Team (NRT) prior to publication for notice and 
comment. This includes coordination with the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in order 
to avoid inconsistent or duplicative requirements in the emergency 
planning responsibilities of those agencies. The NCP is applicable to 
response actions taken pursuant to the authorities under CERCLA and 
section 311 of the CWA, as amended.


<R05>
Sec. 300.3  Scope.

    (a) The NCP applies to and is in effect for:
    (1) Discharges of oil into or on the navigable waters of the United 
States, on the adjoining shorelines, the waters of the contiguous zone, 
into waters of the exclusive economic zone, or that may affect natural 
resources belonging to, appertaining to, or under the exclusive 
management authority of the United States (See sections 311(c)(1) and 
502(7) of the CWA).
    (2) Releases into the environment of hazardous substances, and 
pollutants or contaminants which may present an imminent and substantial 
danger to public health or welfare of the United States.
    (b) The NCP provides for efficient, coordinated, and effective 
response to discharges of oil and releases of hazardous substances, 
pollutants, and contaminants in accordance with the authorities of 
CERCLA and the CWA. It provides for:

[[Page 7]]

    (1) The national response organization that may be activated in 
response actions. It specifies responsibilities among the federal, 
state, and local governments and describes resources that are available 
for response.
    (2) The establishment of requirements for federal, regional, and 
area contingency plans. It also summarizes state and local emergency 
planning requirements under SARA Title III.
    (3) Procedures for undertaking removal actions pursuant to section 
311 of the CWA.
    (4) Procedures for undertaking response actions pursuant to CERCLA.
    (5) Procedures for involving state governments in the initiation, 
development, selection, and implementation of response actions, pursuant 
to CERCLA.
    (6) Listing of federal trustees for natural resources for purposes 
of CERCLA and the CWA.
    (7) Procedures for the participation of other persons in response 
actions.
    (8) Procedures for compiling and making available an administrative 
record for response actions.
    (9) National procedures for the use of dispersants and other 
chemicals in removals under the CWA and response actions under CERCLA.
    (c) In implementing the NCP, consideration shall be given to 
international assistance plans and agreements, security regulations and 
responsibilities based on international agreements, federal statutes, 
and executive orders. Actions taken pursuant to the provisions of any 
applicable international joint contingency plans shall be consistent 
with the NCP, to the greatest extent possible. The Department of State 
shall be consulted, as appropriate, prior to taking any action which may 
affect its activities.
    (d) Additionally, the NCP applies to and is in effect when the 
Federal Response Plan and some or all its Emergency Support Functions 
(ESFs) are activated.

Sec. 300.5  Definitions.

    Terms not defined in this section have the meaning given by CERCLA, 
the OPA, or the CWA.
    Activation means notification by telephone or other expeditious 
manner or, when required, the assembly of some or all appropriate 
members of the RRT or NRT.
    Alternative water supplies as defined by section 101(34) of CERCLA, 
includes, but is not limited to, drinking water and household water 
supplies.
    Applicable requirements means those cleanup standards, standards of 
control, and other substantive requirements, criteria, or limitations 
promulgated under federal environmental or state environmental or 
facility siting laws that specifically address a hazardous substance, 
pollutant, contaminant, remedial action, location, or other circumstance 
found at a CERCLA site. Only those state standards that are identified 
by a state in a timely manner and that are more stringent than federal 
requirements may be applicable.
    Area Committee (AC) as provided for by CWA sections 311(a)(18) and 
(j)(4), means the entity appointed by the President consisting of 
members from qualified personnel of federal, state, and local agencies 
with responsibilities that include preparing an area contingency plan 
for an area designated by the President.
    Area contingency plan (ACP) as provided for by CWA sections 
311(a)(19) and (j)(4), means the plan prepared by an Area Committee that 
is developed to be implemented in conjunction with the NCP and RCP, in 
part to address removal of a worst case discharge and to mitigate or 
prevent a substantial threat of such a discharge from a vessel, offshore 
facility, or onshore facility operating in or near an area designated by 
the President.
    Bioremediation agents means microbiological cultures, enzyme 
additives, or nutrient additives that are deliberately introduced into 
an oil discharge and that will significantly increase the rate of 
biodegradation to mitigate the effects of the discharge.
    Burning agents means those additives that, through physical or 
chemical means, improve the combustibility of the materials to which 
they are applied.
    CERCLA is the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, 
and Liability Act of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and 
Reauthorization Act of 1986.
    CERCLIS is the abbreviation of the CERCLA Information System, EPA's 
comprehensive data base and data management system that inventories and 
tracks releases addressed or needing to be addressed by the Superfund 
program. CERCLIS contains the official inventory of CERCLA sites and 
supports EPA's site planning and tracking functions. Sites that EPA 
decides do not warrant moving further in the site evaluation process are 
given a ``No Further Response Action Planned'' (NFRAP) designation. This 
means that no additional federal steps under CERCLA will be taken at the 
site unless future information so warrants. Sites given a NFRAP 
designation are placed in a separate archival data base. Inclusion of a 
specific site or area in the CERCLIS data base does not represent a 
determination of any party's liability, nor does it represent a finding 
that any response action is necessary.
    Chemical agents means those elements, compounds, or mixtures that 
coagulate, disperse, dissolve, emulsify, foam, neutralize, precipitate, 
reduce, solubilize, oxidize, concentrate, congeal, entrap, fix, make the 
pollutant

[[Page 9]]

mass more rigid or viscous, or otherwise facilitate the mitigation of 
deleterious effects or the removal of the pollutant from the water. 
Chemical agents include biological additives, dispersants, sinking 
agents, miscellaneous oil spill control agents, and burning agents, but 
do not include sorbents.
    Claim for purposes of a release under CERCLA, means a demand in 
writing for a sum certain; for purposes of a discharge under CWA, it 
means a request, made in writing for a sum certain, for compensation for 
damages or removal costs resulting from an incident.
    Claimant as defined by section 1001 of the OPA means any person or 
government who presents a claim for compensation under Title I of the

States waters subject to the tide, United States waters of the Great 
Lakes, specified ports and harbors on inland rivers, waters of the 
contiguous zone, other waters of the high seas subject to the NCP, and 
the land surface or land substrata, ground waters, and ambient air 
proximal to those waters. The term coastal zone delineates an area of 
federal responsibility for response action. Precise boundaries are 
determined by EPA/USCG agreements and identified in federal regional 
contingency plans.
    Coast Guard District Response Group (DRG) as provided for by CWA 
sections 311(a)(20) and (j)(3), means the entity established by the 
Secretary of the department in which the USCG is operating, within each

community concerns. The term ``public'' includes citizens directly 
affected by the site, other interested citizens or parties, organized 
groups, elected officials, and potentially responsible parties (PRPs).
    Community relations coordinator means lead agency staff who work 
with the OSC/RPM to involve and inform the public about the Superfund 
process and response actions in accordance with the interactive 
community relations requirements set forth in the NCP.

to develop and evaluate options for remedial action. The FS emphasizes 
data analysis and is generally performed concurrently and in an 
interactive fashion with the remedial investigation (RI), using data 
gathered during the RI. The RI data are used to define the objectives of 
the response action, to develop remedial action alternatives, and to 
undertake an initial screening and detailed analysis of the 
alternatives. The term also refers to a report that describes the 
results of the study.
    Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan (FRERP) means the 
inter-agency agreement for coordinating the response of various 
agencies, under a variety of statutes, to a large radiological accident. 
The Lead Federal Agency (LFA), defined by the FRERP, activates the FRERP 
for any peacetime radiological emergency which, based upon its 
professional judgment, is expected to have a significant radiological 
effect within the United States, its territories, possessions, or 
territorial waters and that could require a response by several federal 
agencies.
    Federal Response Plan (FRP) means the agreement signed by 27 federal 
departments and agencies in April 1987 and developed under the 
authorities of the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 (42 U.S.C.

including any Alaska Native village but not including any Alaska Native 
regional or village corporation, which is recognized as eligible for the 
special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians 
because of their status as Indians. ``Indian tribe,'' as defined by OPA 
section 1001, means any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized 
group or community, but not including any Alaska Native regional or 
village corporation, which is recognized as eligible for the special 
programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because

discharges, means those waters of the United States in the inland zone, 
waters of the Great Lakes, and specified ports and harbors on inland 
rivers.
    Inland zone means the environment inland of the coastal zone 
excluding the Great Lakes and specified ports and harbors on inland

responsibility for response action. Precise boundaries are determined by 
EPA/USCG agreements and identified in federal regional contingency 
plans.
    Lead administrative trustee means a natural resource trustee who is 
designated on an incident-by-incident basis for the purpose of 
preassessment and damage assessment and chosen by the other trustees 
whose natural resources are affected by the incident. The lead 
administrative trustee facilitates effective and efficient communication 
during response operations between the OSC and the other natural 
resource trustees conducting activities associated with damage 
assessment, and is responsible for applying to the OSC for access to 
response operations resources on behalf of all trustees for initiation 
of a damage assessment.
    Lead agency means the agency that provides the OSC/RPM to plan and 
implement response actions under the NCP. EPA, the USCG, another federal 
agency, or a state (or political subdivision of a state) operating 
pursuant to a contract or cooperative agreement executed pursuant to 
section 104(d)(1) of CERCLA, or designated pursuant to a Superfund 
Memorandum of Agreement (SMOA) entered into pursuant to subpart F of the 
NCP or other agreements may be the lead agency for a response action. In 
the case of a release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or 
contaminant, where the release is on, orthe sole source of the release 
is from, any facility or vessel under the jurisdiction, custody, or 
control of Department of Defense (DOD) or Department of Energy (DOE), 
then DOD or DOE will be the lead agency. Where the release is on, or the 
sole source of the release is from, any facility or vessel

[[Page 12]]

under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of a federal agency other 
than EPA, the USCG, DOD, or DOE, then that agency will be the lead 
agency for remedial actions and removal actions other than emergencies. 
The federal agency maintains its lead agency responsibilities whether 
the remedy is selected by the federal agency for non-NPL sites or by EPA 
and the federal agency or by EPA alone under CERCLA section 120. The 
lead agency will consult with the support agency, if one exists, 
throughout the response process.
    Management of migration means actions that are taken to minimize and

environmental or facility siting laws that, while not ``applicable'' to 
a hazardous substance, pollutant, contaminant, remedial action, 
location, or other circumstance at a CERCLA site, address problems or 
situations sufficiently similar to those encountered at the CERCLA site 
that their use is well suited to the particular site. Only those state 
standards that are identified in a timely manner and are more stringent 
than federal requirements may be relevant and appropriate.
    Remedial design (RD) means the technical analysis and procedures 
which follow the selection of remedy for a site and result in a detailed 
set of plans and specifications for implementation of the remedial 
action.
    Remedial investigation (RI) is a process undertaken by the lead 
agency to determine the nature and extent of the problem presented by 
the release. The RI emphasizes data collection and site 
characterization, and is generally performed concurrently and in an 
interactive fashion with the feasibility study. The RI includes sampling 
and monitoring, as necessary, and includes the gathering of sufficient 
information to determine the necessity for remedial action and to 
support the evaluation of remedial alternatives.
    Remedial project manager (RPM) means the official designated by the 
lead agency to coordinate, monitor, or direct remedial or other response 
actions under subpart E of the NCP.
    Remedy or remedial action (RA) means those actions consistent with 
permanent remedy taken instead of, or in addition to, removal action in 
the event of a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance 
into the environment, to prevent or minimize the release of hazardous 
substances so that they do not migrate to cause substantial danger to 
present or future public health or welfare or the environment. The term 
includes, but is not limited to, such actions at the location of the 
release as storage, confinement, perimeter protection using dikes, 
trenches, or ditches, clay cover, neutralization, cleanup of released 
hazardous substances and associated contaminated materials, recycling or 
reuse, diversion, destruction, segregation of reactive wastes, dredging 
or excavations, repair or replacement of leaking containers, collection 
of leachate and runoff, on-site treatment or incineration, provision of 
alternative water supplies, any monitoring reasonably required to assure 
that such actions protect the public health and welfare and the 
environment and, where appropriate, post-removal site control 
activities. The term includes the costs of permanent relocation of 
residents and businesses and community facilities (including the cost of 
providing ``alternative land of equivalent value'' to an Indian tribe 
pursuant to CERCLA section 126(b)) where EPA determines that, alone or 
in combination with other measures, such relocation is more cost-
effective than, and environmentally preferable to, the transportation, 
storage, treatment, destruction, or secure disposition off-site of such 
hazardous substances, or may otherwise be necessary to protect the 
public health or welfare; the term includes off-site transport and off-
site storage, treatment, destruction, or secure disposition of hazardous 
substances and associated contaminated materials. For the purpose of the 
NCP, the term also includes enforcement activities related thereto.
    Remove or removal as defined by section 311(a)(8) of the CWA, refers 
to containment and removal of oil or hazardous substances from the water 
and shorelines or the taking of such other actions as may be necessary 
to minimize or mitigate damage to the public health or welfare of the 
United States (including, but not limited to, fish, shellfish, wildlife, 
public and private property, and shorelines and beaches) or to the 
environment. For the purpose of the NCP, the term also includes

[[Page 16]]

monitoring of action to remove a discharge. As defined by section 
101(23) of CERCLA, remove or removal means the cleanup or removal of 
released hazardous substances from the environment; such actions as may 
be necessary taken in the event of the threat of release of hazardous 
substances into the environment; such actions as may be necessary to 
monitor, assess, and evaluate the release or threat of release of 
hazardous substances; the disposal of removed material; or the taking of 
such other actions as may be necessary to prevent, minimize, or mitigate 
damage to the public health or welfare of the United States or to the 
environment, which may otherwise result from a release or threat of 
release. The term includes, in addition, without being limited to, 
security fencing or other measures to limit access, provision of 
alternative water supplies, temporary evacuation and housing of 
threatened individuals not otherwise provided for, action taken under 
section 104(b) of CERCLA, post-removal site control, where appropriate, 
and any emergency assistance which may be provided under the Disaster 
Relief Act of 1974. For the purpose of the NCP, the term also includes 
enforcement activities related thereto.
    Removal costs as defined by section 1001 of the OPA means the costs 
of removal that are incurred after a discharge of oil has occurred, or 
in any case in which there is a substantial threat of a discharge of 
oil, the costs to prevent, minimize, or mitigate oil pollution from such 
an incident.
    Respond or response as defined by section 101(25) of CERCLA, means 
remove, removal, remedy, or remedial action, including enforcement 
activities related thereto.
    Responsible party as defined by section 1001 of the OPA, means the 
following:
    (1) Vessels--In the case of a vessel, any person owning, operating, 
or demise chartering the vessel.
    (2) Onshore Facilities--In the case of an onshore facility (other 
than a pipeline), any person owning or operating the facility, except a 
federal agency, state, municipality, commission, or political 
subdivision of a state, or any interstate body, that as the owner 
transfers possession and right to use the property to another person by 
lease, assignment, or permit.
    (3) Offshore Facilities--In the case of an offshore facility (other 
than a pipeline or a deepwater port licensed under the Deepwater Port 
Act of 1974 (33 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.)), the lessee or permittee of the 
area in which the facility is located or the holder of a right of use 
and easement granted under applicable state law or the Outer Continental 
Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301-1356) for the area in which the facility 
is located (if the holder is a different person than the lessee or 
permittee), except a federal agency, state, municipality, commission, or 
political subdivision of a state, or any interstate body, that as owner 
transfers possession and right to use the property to another person by 
lease, assignment, or permit.
    (4) Deepwater Ports--In the case of a deepwater port licensed under 
the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (33 U.S.C. 1501-1524), the licensee.

    SARA is the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986. In 
addition to certain free-standing provisions of law, it includes 
amendments to CERCLA, the Solid Waste Disposal Act, and the Internal 
Revenue Code. Among the free-standing provisions of law is Title III of 
SARA, also known as the ``Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know 
Act of 1986'' and Title IV of SARA, also known as the ``Radon Gas and 
Indoor Air Quality Research Act of 1986.'' Title V of SARA amending the 
Internal Revenue Code is also known as the ``Superfund Revenue Act of 
1986.''
    Sinking agents means those additives applied to oil discharges to 
sink floating pollutants below the water surface.
    Site inspection (SI) means an on-site investigation to determine 
whether there is a release or potential release and the nature of the 
associated

[[Page 17]]

threats. The purpose is to augment the data collected in the preliminary 
assessment and to generate, if necessary, sampling and other field data 
to determine if further action or investigation is appropriate.
    Size classes of discharges refers to the following size classes of 
oil discharges which are provided as guidance to the OSC and serve as 
the criteria for the actions delineated in subpart D. They are not meant 
to imply associated degrees of hazard to public health or welfare of the 
United States, nor are they a measure of environmental injury. Any oil 
discharge that poses a substantial threat to public health or welfare of 
the United States or the environment or results in significant public 
concern shall be classified as a major discharge regardless of the 
following quantitative measures:
    (1) Minor discharge means a discharge to the inland waters of less 
than 1,000 gallons of oil or a discharge to the coastal waters of less 
than 10,000 gallons of oil.
    (2) Medium discharge means a discharge of 1,000 to 10,000 gallons of 
oil to the inland waters or a discharge of 10,000 to 100,000 gallons of 
oil to the coastal waters.
    (3) Major discharge means a discharge of more than 10,000 gallons of 
oil to the inland waters or more than 100,000 gallons of oil to the 
coastal waters.
    Size classes of releases refers to the following size 
classifications which are provided as guidance to the OSC for meeting 
pollution reporting requirements in subpart B. The final determination 
of the appropriate classification of a release will be made by the OSC 
based on consideration of the particular release (e.g., size, location, 
impact, etc.):
    (1) Minor release means a release of a quantity of hazardous 
substance(s), pollutant(s), or contaminant(s) that poses minimal threat 
to public health or welfare of the United States or the environment.
    (2) Medium release means a release not meeting the criteria for 
classification as a minor or major release.
    (3) Major release means a release of any quantity of hazardous 
substance(s), pollutant(s), or contaminant(s) that poses a substantial 
threat to public health or welfare of the United States or the 
environment or results in significant public concern.
    Sorbents means essentially inert and insoluble materials that are 
used to remove oil and hazardous substances from water through 
adsorption, in which the oil or hazardous substance is attracted to the 
sorbent surface and then adheres to it; absorption, in which the oil or 
hazardous substance penetrates the pores of the sorbent material; or a 
combination of the two. Sorbents are generally manufactured in 
particulate form for spreading over an oil slick or as sheets, rolls, 
pillows, or booms. The sorbent material may consist of, but is not 
limited to, the following materials:
    (1) Organic products--
    (i) Peat moss or straw;
    (ii) Cellulose fibers or cork;
    (iii) Corn cobs;
    (iv) Chicken, duck, or other bird feathers.
    (2) Mineral compounds--
    (i) Volcanic ash or perlite;
    (ii) Vermiculite or zeolite.
    (3) Synthetic products--
    (i) Polypropylene;
    (ii) Polyethylene;
    (iii) Polyurethane;
    (iv) Polyester.
    Source control action is the construction or installation and start-
up of those actions necessary to prevent the continued release of 
hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants (primarily from a 
source on top of or within the ground, or in buildings or other 
structures) into the environment.
    Source control maintenance measures are those measures intended to 
maintain the effectiveness of source control actions once such actions 
are operating and functioning properly, such as the maintenance of 
landfill caps and leachate collection systems.
    Specified ports and harbors means those ports and harbor areas on 
inland rivers, and land areas immediately adjacent to those waters, 
where the USCG acts as predesignated on-scene

[[Page 18]]

coordinator. Precise locations are determined by EPA/USCG regional 
agreements and identified in federal Regional Contingency Plans and Area 
Contingency Plans.
    Spill of national significance (SONS) means a spill that due to its 
severity, size, location, actual or potential impact on the public 
health and welfare or the environment, or the necessary response effort, 
is so complex that it requires extraordinary coordination of federal, 
state, local, and responsible party resources to contain and clean up 
the discharge.
    State means the several states of the United States, the District of 
Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the 
U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, and any 
other territory or possession over which the United States has 
jurisdiction. For purposes of the NCP, the term includes Indian tribes 
as defined in the NCP except where specifically noted. Section 126 of 
CERCLA provides that the governing body of an Indian tribe shall be 
afforded substantially the same treatment as a state with respect to 
certain provisions of CERCLA. Section 300.515(b) of the NCP describes 
the requirements pertaining to Indian tribes that wish to be treated as 
states under CERCLA.
    Superfund Memorandum of Agreement (SMOA) means a nonbinding, written 
document executed by an EPA Regional Administrator and the head of a 
state agency that may establish the nature and extent of EPA and state 
interaction during the removal, pre-remedial, remedial, and/or 
enforcement response process. The SMOA is not a site-specific document 
although attachments may address specific sites. The SMOA generally 
defines the role and responsibilities of both the lead and the support 
agencies.
    Superfund state contract is a joint, legally binding agreement 
between EPA and a state to obtain the necessary assurances before a 
federal-lead remedial action can begin at a site. In the case of a 
political subdivision-lead remedial response, a three-party Superfund 
state contract among EPA, the state, and political subdivision thereof, 
is required before a political subdivision takes the lead for any phase 
of remedial response to ensure state involvement pursuant to section 
121(f)(1) of CERCLA. The Superfund state contract may be amended to 
provide the state's CERCLA section 104 assurances before a political 
subdivision can take the lead for remedial action.
    Support agency means the agency or agencies that provide the support 
agency coordinator to furnish necessary data to the lead agency, review 
response data and documents, and provide other assistance as requested 
by the OSC or RPM. EPA, the USCG, another federal agency, or a state may 
be support agencies for a response action if operating pursuant to a 
contract executed under section 104(d)(1) of CERCLA or designated 
pursuant to a Superfund Memorandum of Agreement entered into pursuant to 
subpart F of the NCP or other agreement. The support agency may also 
concur on decision documents.
    Support agency coordinator (SAC) means the official designated by 
the support agency, as appropriate, to interact and coordinate with the 
lead agency in response actions under subpart E of this part.
    Surface collecting agents means those chemical agents that form a 
surface film to control the layer thickness of oil.
    Surface washing agent is any product that removes oil from solid 
surfaces, such as beaches and rocks, through a detergency mechanism and 
does not involve dispersing or solubilizing the oil into the water 
column.
    Tank vessel as defined by section 1001 of the OPA means a vessel 
that is constructed or adapted to carry, or that carries oil or 
hazardous material in bulk as cargo or cargo residue, and that:
    (1) is a vessel of the United States;
    (2) operates on the navigable waters; or
    (3) transfers oil or hazardous material in a place subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States.
    Threat of discharge or release, see definitions for discharge and 
release.
    Threat of release, see definition for release.
    Treatment technology means any unit operation or series of unit 
operations

[[Page 19]]

that alters the composition of a hazardous substance or pollutant or 
contaminant through chemical, biological, or physical means so as to 
reduce toxicity, mobility, or volume of the contaminated materials being 
treated. Treatment technologies are an alternative to land disposal of 
hazardous wastes without treatment.
    Trustee means an official of a federal natural resources management 
agency designated in subpart G of the NCP or a designated state official 
or Indian tribe or, in the case of discharges covered by the OPA, a 
foreign government official, who may pursue claims for damages under 
section 107(f) of CERCLA or section 1006 of the OPA.
    United States when used in relation to section 311(a)(5) of the CWA, 
means the states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the United 
States Virgin Islands, and the Pacific Island Governments. United 
States, when used in relation to section 101(27) of CERCLA and section 
1001(36) of the OPA, includes the several states of the United States, 
the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, 
American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of 
the Northern Marianas, and any other territory or possession over which 
the United States has jurisdiction.
    Vessel as defined by section 101(28) of CERCLA, means every 
description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or 
capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water; and, as 
defined by section 311(a)(3) of the CWA, means every description of 
watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being 
used, as a means of transportation on water other than a public vessel.
    Volunteer means any individual accepted to perform services by the 
lead agency which has authority to accept volunteer services (examples: 
See 16 U.S.C. 742f(c)). A volunteer is subject to the provisions of the 
authorizing statute and the NCP.
    Worst case discharge as defined by section 311(a)(24) of the CWA, 
means, in the case of a vessel, a discharge in adverse weather 
conditions of its entire cargo, and, in the case of an offshore facility 
or onshore facility, the largest foreseeable discharge in adverse 
weather conditions.

Sec. 300.100  Duties of President delegated to federal agencies.

    In Executive Orders 12580 and 12777, the President delegated certain 
functions and responsibilities vested in him by the CWA, CERCLA, and the 
OPA.


<R05>
Sec. 300.105  General organization concepts.

    (a) Federal agencies should:
    (1) Plan for emergencies and develop procedures for addressing oil 
discharges and releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or 
contaminants;
    (2) Coordinate their planning, preparedness, and response activities 
with one another;
    (3) Coordinate their planning, preparedness, and response activities 
with affected states, local governments, and private entities; and
    (4) Make available those facilities or resources that may be useful 
in a response situation, consistent with agency authorities and 
capabilities.

[[Page 20]]

    (b) Three fundamental kinds of activities are performed pursuant to 
the NCP:
    (1) Preparedness planning and coordination for response to a 
discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or 
contaminant;
    (2) Notification and communications; and
    (3) Response operations at the scene of a discharge or release.
     (c) The organizational elements created to perform these activities 
are:
    (1) The NRT, responsible for national response and preparedness 
planning, for coordinating regional planning, and for providing policy 
guidance and support to the Regional Response Teams (RRTs). NRT 
membership consists of representatives from the agencies specified in 
Sec. 300.175(b).
    (2) RRTs, responsible for regional planning and preparedness 
activities before response actions, and for providing advice and support 
to the OSC or RPM when activated during a response. RRT membership 
consists of designated representatives from each federal agency 
participating in the NRT together with state and (as agreed upon by the 
states) local government representatives.
    (3) The OSC and the RPM, primarily responsible for directing 
response efforts and coordinating all other efforts at the scene of a 
discharge or release. The other responsibilities of OSCs and RPMs are 
described in Sec. 300.135.
    (4) Area Committees, responsible for developing, under direction of 
the OSC, ACPs for each area designated by the President. 
Responsibilities of Area Committees are described in Sec. 300.205(c).
    (d) The basic framework for the response management structure is a 
system (e.g., a unified command system) that brings together the 
functions of the Federal Government, the state government, and the 
responsible party to achieve an effective and efficient response, where 
the OSC maintains authority.
    (e)(1) The organizational concepts of the national response system 
are depicted in the following Figures 1a and 1b:

<R05>
Sec. 300.110  National Response Team.

    National planning and coordination is accomplished through the NRT.
    (a) The NRT consists of representatives from the agencies named in 
Sec. 300.175(b). Each agency shall designate a member to the team and 
sufficient alternates to ensure representation, as agency resources 
permit. The NRT will consider requests for membership on the NRT from 
other agencies. Other agencies may request membership by forwarding such 
requests to the chair of the NRT.
    (b) The chair of the NRT shall be the representative of EPA and the 
vice chair shall be the representative of the USCG, with the exception 
of periods of activation because of response action. During activation, 
the chair shall be the member agency providing the OSC/RPM. The vice 
chair shall maintain records of NRT activities along with national, 
regional, and area plans for response actions.
    (c) While the NRT desires to achieve a consensus on all matters 
brought before it, certain matters may prove unresolvable by this means. 
In such cases, each agency serving as a participating agency on the NRT 
may be accorded one vote in NRT proceedings.
    (d) The NRT may establish such bylaws and committees as it deems 
appropriate to further the purposes for which it is established.
    (e) The NRT shall evaluate methods of responding to discharges or 
releases; shall recommend any changes needed in the response 
organization; and shall recommend to the Administrator of EPA changes to 
the NCP designed to improve the effectiveness of the national response 
system, including drafting of regulatory language.
    (f) The NRT shall provide policy and program direction to the RRTs.
    (g) The NRT may consider and make recommendations to appropriate 
agencies on the training, equipping, and protection of response teams 
and necessary research, development, demonstration, and evaluation to 
improve response capabilities.
    (h) Direct planning and preparedness responsibilities of the NRT 
include:
    (1) Maintaining national preparedness to respond to a major 
discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or 
contaminant that is beyond regional capabilities;
    (2) Publishing guidance documents for preparation and implementation 
of SARA Title III local emergency response plans;
    (3) Monitoring incoming reports from all RRTs and activating for a 
response action, when necessary;
    (4) Coordinating a national program to assist member agencies in 
preparedness planning and response, and enhancing coordination of member 
agency preparedness programs;
    (5) Developing procedures, in coordination with the NSFCC, as 
appropriate, to ensure the coordination of federal, state, and local 
governments, and private response to oil discharges and releases of 
hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants;
    (6) Monitoring response-related research and development, testing, 
and evaluation activities of NRT agencies to enhance coordination, avoid 
duplication of effort, and facilitate research in support of response 
activities;
    (7) Developing recommendations for response training and for 
enhancing the coordination of available resources among agencies with 
training responsibilities under the NCP;
    (8) Reviewing regional responses to oil discharges and hazardous 
substance, pollutant, or contaminant releases, including an evaluation 
of equipment readiness and coordination among responsible public 
agencies and private organizations; and
    (9) Assisting in developing a national exercise program, in 
coordination with the NSFCC, to ensure preparedness and coordination 
nationwide.
    (i) The NRT will consider matters referred to it for advice or 
resolution by an RRT.
    (j) The NRT should be activated as an emergency response team:
    (1) When an oil discharge or hazardous substance release:
    (i) Exceeds the response capability of the region in which it 
occurs;
    (ii) Transects regional boundaries; or
    (iii) Involves a substantial threat to the public health or welfare 
of the United States or the environment, substantial amounts of 
property, or substantial threats to natural resources;
    (2) If requested by any NRT member.

[[Page 27]]

    (k) When activated for a response action, the NRT shall meet at the 
call of the chair and may:
    (1) Monitor and evaluate reports from the OSC/RPM and recommend to 
the OSC/RPM, through the RRT, actions to combat the discharge or 
release;
    (2) Request other federal, state, and local governments, or private 
agencies, to provide resources under their existing authorities to 
combat a discharge or release, or to monitor response operations; and
    (3) Coordinate the supply of equipment, personnel, or technical 
advice to the affected region from other regions or districts.


<R05>
Sec. 300.115  Regional Response Teams.

    (a) Regional planning and coordination of preparedness and response 
actions is accomplished through the RRT. In the case of a discharge of 
oil, preparedness activities will be carried out in conjunction with 
Area Committees, as appropriate. The RRT agency membership parallels 
that of the NRT, as described in Sec. 300.110, but also includes state 
and local representation. The RRT provides:
    (1) The appropriate regional mechanism for development and 
coordination of preparedness activities before a response action is 
taken and for coordination of assistance and advice to the OSC/RPM 
during such response actions; and
    (2) Guidance to Area Committees, as appropriate, to ensure inter-
area consistency and consistency of individual ACPs with the RCP and 
NCP.
    (b) The two principal components of the RRT mechanism are a standing 
team, which consists of designated representatives from each 
participating federal agency, state governments, and local governments 
(as agreed upon by the states); and incident-specific teams formed from 
the standing team when the RRT is activated for a response. On incident-
specific teams, participation by the RRT member agencies will relate to 
the technical nature of the incident and its geographic location.
    (1) The standing team's jurisdiction corresponds to the standard 
federal regions, except for Alaska, Oceania in the Pacific, and the 
Caribbean area, each of which has a separate standing RRT. The role of 
the standing RRT includes communications systems and procedures, 
planning, coordination, training, evaluation, preparedness, and related 
matters on a regionwide basis. It also includes coordination of Area 
Committees for these functions in areas within their respective regions, 
as appropriate.
    (2) The role of the incident-specific team is determined by the 
operational requirements of the response to a specific discharge or 
release. Appropriate levels of activation and/or notification of the 
incident-specific RRT, including participation by state and local 
governments, shall be determined by the designated RRT chair for the 
incident, based on the RCP. The incident-specific RRT supports the 
designated OSC/RPM. The designated OSC/RPM directs response efforts and 
coordinates all other efforts at the scene of a discharge or release.
    (c) The representatives of EPA and the USCG shall act as co-chairs 
of RRTs except when the RRT is activated. When the RRT is activated for 
response actions, the chair shall be the member agency providing the 
OSC/RPM.
    (d) Each participating agency should designate one member and at 
least one alternate member to the RRT. Agencies whose regional 
subdivisions do not correspond to the standard federal regions may 
designate additional representatives to the standing RRT to ensure 
appropriate coverage of the standard federal region. Participating 
states may also designate one member and at least one alternate member 
to the RRT. Indian tribal governments may arrange for representation 
with the RRT appropriate to their geographical location. All agencies 
and states may also provide additional representatives as observers to 
meetings of the RRT.
    (e) RRT members should designate representatives and alternates from 
their agencies as resource personnel for RRT activities, including RRT 
work planning, and membership on incident-specific teams in support of 
the OSCs/RPMs.
    (f) Federal RRT members or their representatives should provide 
OSCs/ 

[[Page 28]]

RPMs with assistance from their respective federal agencies commensurate 
with agency responsibilities, resources, and capabilities within the 
region. During a response action, the members of the RRT should seek to 
make available the resources of their agencies to the OSC/RPM as 
specified in the RCP and ACP.
    (g) RRT members should nominate appropriately qualified 
representatives from their agencies to work with OSCs in developing and 
maintaining ACPs.
    (h) Affected states are encouraged to participate actively in all 
RRT activities. Each state governor is requested to assign an office or 
agency to represent the state on the appropriate RRT; to designate 
representatives to work with the RRT in developing RCPs; to plan for, 
make available, and coordinate state resources; and to serve as the 
contact point for coordination of response with local government 
agencies, whether or not represented on the RRT. The state's RRT 
representative should keep the State Emergency Response Commission 
(SERC), described in Sec. 300.205(d), apprised of RRT activities and 
coordinate RRT activities with the SERC. Local governments are invited 
to participate in activities on the appropriate RRT as provided by state 
law or as arranged by the state's representative. Indian tribes are also 
invited to participate in such activities.
    (i) The standing RRT shall recommend changes in the regional 
response organization as needed, revise the RCP as needed, evaluate the 
preparedness of the participating agencies and the effectiveness of ACPs 
for the federal response to discharges and releases, and provide 
technical assistance for preparedness to the response community. The RRT 
should:
    (1) Review and comment, to the extent practicable, on local 
emergency response plans or other issues related to the preparation, 
implementation, or exercise of such plans upon request of a local 
emergency planning committee;
    (2) Evaluate regional and local responses to discharges or releases 
on a continuing basis, considering available legal remedies, equipment 
readiness, and coordination among responsible public agencies and 
private organizations, and recommend improvements;
    (3) Recommend revisions of the NCP to the NRT, based on observations 
of response operations;
    (4) Review OSC actions to ensure that RCPs and ACPs are effective;
    (5) Encourage the state and local response community to improve its 
preparedness for response;
    (6) In coordination with Area Committees and in accordance with any 
applicable laws, regulations, or requirements, conduct advance planning 
for use of dispersants, surface washing agents, surface collecting 
agents, burning agents, bioremediation agents, or other chemical agents 
in accordance with subpart J of this part;
    (7) Be prepared to provide response resources to major discharges or 
releases outside the region;
    (8) Conduct or participate in training and exercises as necessary to 
encourage preparedness activities of the response community within the 
region;
    (9) Meet at least semiannually to review response actions carried 
out during the preceding period, consider changes in RCPs, and recommend 
changes in ACPs;
    (10) Provide letter reports on RRT activities to the NRT twice a 
year, no later than January 31 and July 31. At a minimum, reports should 
summarize recent activities, organizational changes, operational 
concerns, and efforts to improve state and local coordination; and
    (11) Ensure maximum participation in the national exercise program 
for announced and unannounced exercises.
    (j)(1) The RRT may be activated by the chair as an incident-specific 
response team when a discharge or release:
    (i) Exceeds the response capability available to the OSC/RPM in the 
place where it occurs;
    (ii) Transects state boundaries;
    (iii) May pose a substantial threat to the public health or welfare 
of the United States or the environment, or to regionally significant 
amounts of property; or
    (iv) Is a worst case discharge, as described in Sec. 300.324. RCPs 
shall specify detailed criteria for activation of RRTs.

[[Page 29]]

    (2) The RRT will be activated during any discharge or release upon a 
request from the OSC/RPM, or from any RRT representative, to the chair 
of the RRT. Requests for RRT activation shall later be confirmed in 
writing. Each representative, or an appropriate alternate, should be 
notified immediately when the RRT is activated.
    (3) During prolonged removal or remedial action, the RRT may not 
need to be activated or may need to be activated only in a limited 
sense, or may need to have available only those member agencies of the 
RRT who are directly affected or who can provide direct response 
assistance.
    (4) When the RRT is activated for a discharge or release, agency 
representatives shall meet at the call of the chair and may:
    (i) Monitor and evaluate reports from the OSC/RPM, advise the OSC/
RPM on the duration and extent of response, and recommend to the OSC/RPM 
specific actions to respond to the discharge or release;
    (ii) Request other federal, state, or local governments, or private 
agencies, to provide resources under their existing authorities to 
respond to a discharge or release or to monitor response operations;
    (iii) Help the OSC/RPM prepare information releases for the public 
and for communication with the NRT;
    (iv) If the circumstances warrant, make recommendations to the 
regional or district head of the agency providing the OSC/RPM that a 
different OSC/RPM should be designated; and
    (v) Submit pollution reports to the NRC as significant developments 
occur.
    (5) At the regional level, a Regional Response Center (RRC) may 
provide facilities and personnel for communications, information 
storage, and other requirements for coordinating response. The location 
of each RRC should be provided in the RCP.
    (6) When the RRT is activated, affected states may participate in 
all RRT deliberations. State government representatives participating in 
the RRT have the same status as any federal member of the RRT.
    (7) The RRT can be deactivated when the incident-specific RRT chair 
determines that the OSC/RPM no longer requires RRT assistance.
    (8) Notification of the RRT may be appropriate when full activation 
is not necessary, with systematic communication of pollution reports or 
other means to keep RRT members informed as to actions of potential 
concern to a particular agency, or to assist in later RRT evaluation of 
regionwide response effectiveness.
    (k) Whenever there is insufficient national policy guidance on a 
matter before the RRT, a technical matter requiring solution, a question 
concerning interpretation of the NCP, or a disagreement on discretionary 
actions among RRT members that cannot be resolved at the regional level, 
it may be referred to the NRT, described in Sec. 300.110, for advice.


<R05>
Sec. 300.120  On-scene coordinators and remedial project managers: general responsibilities.

    (a) The OSC/RPM directs response efforts and coordinates all other 
efforts at the scene of a discharge or release. As part of the planning 
and preparedness for response, OSCs shall be predesignated by the 
regional or district head of the lead agency. EPA and the USCG shall 
predesignate OSCs for all areas in each region, except as provided in 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. RPMs shall be assigned by the 
lead agency to manage remedial or other response actions at NPL sites, 
except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
    (1) The USCG shall provide OSCs for oil discharges, including 
discharges from facilities and vessels under the jurisdiction of another 
federal agency, within or threatening the coastal zone. The USCG shall 
also provide OSCs for the removal of releases of hazardous substances, 
pollutants, or contaminants into or threatening the coastal zone, except 
as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. The USCG shall not provide 
predesignated OSCs for discharges or releases from hazardous waste 
management facilities or in similarly chronic incidents. The USCG shall 
provide an initial response to discharges or releases from hazardous 
waste management facilities within

[[Page 30]]

the coastal zone in accordance with Department of Transportation (DOT)/
EPA Instrument of Redelegation (May 27, 1988) except as provided by 
paragraph (b) of this section. The USCG OSC shall contact the cognizant 
RPM as soon as it is evident that a removal may require a follow-up 
remedial action, to ensure that the required planning can be initiated 
and an orderly transition to an EPA or state lead can occur.
    (2) EPA shall provide OSCs for discharges or releases into or 
threatening the inland zone and shall provide RPMs for federally funded 
remedial actions, except in the case of state-lead federally funded 
response and as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. EPA will also 
assume all remedial actions at NPL sites in the coastal zone, even where 
removals are initiated by the USCG, except as provided in paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (b) In general, USCG Captains of the Port (COTP) shall serve as the 
designated OSCs for areas in the coastal zone for which an ACP is 
required under CWA section 311(j) and EPA Regional Administrators shall 
designate OSCs for areas in the inland zone for which an ACP is required 
under CWA section 311(j).
    (c) For releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or 
contaminants, when the release is on, or the sole source of the release 
is from, any facility or vessel, including vessels bareboat-chartered 
and operated, under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of DOD, DOE, 
or other federal agency:
    (1) In the case of DOD or DOE, DOD or DOE shall provide OSCs/RPMs 
responsible for taking all response actions; and
    (2) In the case of a federal agency other than EPA, DOD, or DOE, 
such agency shall provide OSCs for all removal actions that are not 
emergencies and shall provide RPMs for all remedial actions.
    (d) DOD will be the removal response authority with respect to 
incidents involving DOD military weapons and munitions or weapons and 
munitions under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of DOD.
    (e) The OSC is responsible for overseeing development of the ACP in 
the area of the OSC's responsibility. ACPs shall, as appropriate, be 
accomplished in cooperation with the RRT, and designated state and local 
representatives. In contingency planning and removal, the OSC 
coordinates, directs, and reviews the work of other agencies, Area 
Committees, responsible parties, and contractors to assure compliance 
with the NCP, decision document, consent decree, administrative order, 
and lead agency-approved plans applicable to the response.
    (f) The RPM is the prime contact for remedial or other response 
actions being taken (or needed) at sites on the proposed or promulgated 
NPL, and for sites not on the NPL but under the jurisdiction, custody, 
or control of a federal agency. The RPM's responsibilities include:
    (1) Fund-financed response: The RPM coordinates, directs, and 
reviews the work of EPA, states and local governments, the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers, and all other agencies and contractors to assure 
compliance with the NCP. Based upon the reports of these parties, the 
RPM recommends action for decisions by lead agency officials. The RPM's 
period of responsibility begins prior to initiation of the remedial 
investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS), described in Sec. 300.430, and 
continues through design, remedial action, deletion of the site from the 
NPL, and the CERCLA cost recovery activity. When a removal and remedial 
action occur at the same site, the OSC and RPM should coordinate to 
ensure an orderly transition of responsibility.
    (2) Federal-lead non-Fund-financed response: The RPM coordinates, 
directs, and reviews the work of other agencies, responsible parties, 
and contractors to assure compliance with the NCP, Record of Decision 
(ROD), consent decree, administrative order, and lead agency-approved 
plans applicable to the response. Based upon the reports of these 
parties, the RPM shall recommend action for decisions by lead agency 
officials. The RPM's period of responsibility begins prior to initiation 
of the RI/FS, described in Sec. 300.430, and continues through design 
and remedial action and the CERCLA cost recovery activity. The OSC and 
RPM shall ensure orderly transition of responsibilities from one to the 
other.

[[Page 31]]

    (3) The RPM shall participate in all decision-making processes 
necessary to ensure compliance with the NCP, including, as appropriate, 
agreements between EPA or other federal agencies and the state. The RPM 
may also review responses where EPA has preauthorized a person to file a 
claim for reimbursement to determine that the response was consistent 
with the terms of such preauthorization in cases where claims are filed 
for reimbursement.
    (g)(1) Where a support agency has been identified through a 
cooperative agreement, Superfund Memorandum of Agreement (SMOA), or 
other agreement, that agency may designate a support agency coordinator 
(SAC) to provide assistance, as requested, by the OSC/RPM. The SAC is 
the prime representative of the support agency for response actions.
    (2) The SAC's responsibilities may include:
    (i) Providing and reviewing data and documents as requested by the 
OSC/RPM during the planning, design, and cleanup activities of the 
response action; and
    (ii) Providing other assistance as requested.
    (h)(1) The lead agency should provide appropriate training for its 
OSCs, RPMs, and other response personnel to carry out their 
responsibilities under the NCP.
    (2) OSCs/RPMs should ensure that persons designated to act as their 
on-scene representatives are adequately trained and prepared to carry 
out actions under the NCP, to the extent practicable.


<R05>
Sec. 300.125  Notification and communications.

    (a) The National Response Center (NRC), located at USCG 
Headquarters, is the national communications center, continuously manned 
for handling activities related to response actions. The NRC acts as the 
single point of contact for all pollution incident reporting, and as the 
NRT communications center. Notice of discharges and releases must be 
made telephonically through a toll free number or a special local number 
(Telecommunication Device for the Deaf (TDD) and collect calls 
accepted). (Notification details appear in Secs. 300.300 and 300.405.) 
The NRC receives and immediately relays telephone notices of discharges 
or releases to the appropriate predesignated federal OSC. The telephone 
report is distributed to any interested NRT member agency or federal 
entity that has established a written agreement or understanding with 
the NRC. The NRC evaluates incoming information and immediately advises 
FEMA of a potential major disaster situation.
    (b) The Commandant, USCG, in conjunction with other NRT agencies, 
shall provide the necessary personnel, communications, plotting 
facilities, and equipment for the NRC.
    (c) Notice of an oil discharge or release of a hazardous substance 
in an amount equal to or greater than the reportable quantity must be 
made immediately in accordance with 33 CFR part 153, subpart B, and 40 
CFR part 302, respectively. Notification shall be made to the NRC Duty 
Officer, HQ USCG, Washington, DC, telephone (800) 424-8802 or (202) 267-
2675. All notices of discharges or releases received at the NRC will be 
relayed immediately by telephone to the OSC.


<R05>
Sec. 300.130  Determinations to initiate response and special conditions.

    (a) In accordance with CWA and CERCLA, the Administrator of EPA or 
the Secretary of the department in which the USCG is operating, as 
appropriate, is authorized to act for the United States to take response 
measures deemed necessary to protect the public health or welfare or 
environment from discharges of oil or releases of hazardous substances, 
pollutants, or contaminants except with respect to such releases on or 
from vessels or facilities under the jurisdiction, custody, or control 
of other federal agencies.
    (b) The Administrator of EPA or the Secretary of the department in 
which the USCG is operating, as appropriate, is authorized to initiate 
and, in the case of a discharge posing a substantial threat to public 
health or welfare of the United States is required to initiate and 
direct, appropriate response activities when the Administrator or 
Secretary determines that any oil or CWA hazardous substance is 
discharged or

[[Page 32]]

there is a substantial threat of such discharge from any vessel or 
offshore or onshore facility into or on the navigable waters of the 
United States, on the adjoining shorelines to the navigable waters, into 
or on the waters of the exclusive economic zone, or that may affect 
natural resources belonging to, appertaining to, or under exclusive 
management authority of the United States; or
    (c) The Administrator of EPA or the Secretary of the department in 
which the USCG is operating, as appropriate, is authorized to initiate 
appropriate response activities when the Administrator or Secretary 
determines that any hazardous substance is released or there is a threat 
of such a release into the environment, or there is a release or threat 
of release into the environment of any pollutant or contaminant which 
may present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or 
welfare of the United States.
    (d) In addition to any actions taken by a state or local government, 
the Administrator of EPA or the Secretary of the department in which the 
USCG is operating may request the U.S. Attorney General to secure the 
relief from any person, including the owner or operator of the vessel or 
facility necessary to abate a threat or, after notice to the affected 
state, take any other action authorized by section 311 of the CWA or 
section 106 of CERCLA as appropriate, including issuing administrative 
orders, that may be necessary to protect the public health or welfare, 
if the Administrator or Secretary determines:
    (1) That there may be an imminent and substantial threat to the 
public health or welfare of the United States or the environment of the 
United States, including fish, shellfish, and wildlife, public and 
private property, shorelines, beaches, habitats, and other living and 
nonliving natural resources under the jurisdiction or control of the 
United States, because of an actual or threatened discharge of oil or a 
CWA hazardous substance from any vessel or offshore or onshore facility 
into or upon the navigable waters of the United States; or
    (2) That there may be an imminent and substantial endangerment to 
the public health or welfare of the United States or the environment 
because of a release of a CERCLA hazardous substance from a facility.
    (e) Response actions to remove discharges originating from 
operations conducted subject to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act 
shall be in accordance with the NCP.
    (f) Where appropriate, when a discharge or release involves 
radioactive materials, the lead or support federal agency shall act 
consistent with the notification and assistance procedures described in 
the appropriate Federal Radiological Plan. For the purpose of the NCP, 
the FRERP (24 CFR part 2401) is the appropriate plan. Most radiological 
discharges and releases do not result in FRERP activation and should be 
handled in accordance with the NCP. However, releases from nuclear 
incidents subject to requirements for financial protection established 
by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission under the Price-Anderson amendments 
(section 170) of the Atomic Energy Act are specifically excluded from 
CERCLA and NCP requirements.
    (g) Removal actions involving nuclear weapons should be conducted in 
accordance with the joint Department of Defense, Department of Energy, 
and FEMA Agreement for Response to Nuclear Incidents and Nuclear Weapons 
Significant Incidents (January 8, 1981).
    (h) If the situation is beyond the capability of state and local 
governments and the statutory authority of federal agencies, the 
President may, under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, act upon a request 
by the governor and declare a major disaster or emergency and appoint a 
Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) to coordinate all federal disaster 
assistance activities. In such cases, the OSC/RPM would continue to 
carry out OSC/RPM responsibilities under the NCP, but would coordinate 
those activities with the FCO to ensure consistency with other federal 
disaster assistance activities.
    (i) In the event of a declaration of a major disaster by the 
President, the FEMA may activate the Federal Response Plan (FRP). A FCO, 
designated by the President, may implement the FRP and coordinate and 
direct emergency assistance and disaster relief of

[[Page 33]]

impacted individuals, business, and public services under the Robert T. 
Stafford Disaster Relief Act. Delivery of federal assistance is 
facilitated through twelve functional annexes to the FRP known as 
Emergency Support Functions (ESFs). EPA coordinates activities under ESF 
#10--Hazardous Materials, which addresses preparedness and response to 
hazardous materials and oil incidents caused by a natural disaster or 
other catastrophic event. In such cases, the OSC/RPM should coordinate 
response activities with the FCO, through the incident-specific ESF #10 
Chair, to ensure consistency with federal disaster assistance 
activities.


<R05>
Sec. 300.135  Response operations.

    (a) The OSC/RPM, consistent with Secs. 300.120 and 300.125, shall 
direct response efforts and coordinate all other efforts at the scene of 
a discharge or release. As part of the planning and preparation for 
response, the OSCs/RPMs shall be predesignated by the regional or 
district head of the lead agency.
    (b) The first federal official affiliated with an NRT member agency 
to arrive at the scene of a discharge or release should coordinate 
activities under the NCP and is authorized to initiate, in consultation 
with the OSC, any necessary actions normally carried out by the OSC 
until the arrival of the predesignated OSC. This official may initiate 
federal fund-financed actions only as authorized by the OSC or, if the 
OSC is unavailable, the authorized representative of the lead agency.
    (c) The OSC/RPM shall, to the extent practicable, collect pertinent 
facts about the discharge or release, such as its source and cause; the 
identification of potentially responsible parties; the nature, amount, 
and location of discharged or released materials; the probable direction 
and time of travel of discharged or released materials; whether the 
discharge is a worst case discharge as discussed in Sec. 300.324; the 
pathways to human and environmental exposure; the potential impact on 
human health, welfare, and safety and the environment; whether the 
discharge or release poses a substantial threat to the public health or 
welfare of the United States as discussed in Sec. 300.322; the potential 
impact on natural resources and property which may be affected; 
priorities for protecting human health and welfare and the environment; 
and appropriate cost documentation.
    (d) The OSC's/RPM's efforts shall be coordinated with other 
appropriate federal, state, local, and private response agencies. OSCs/
RPMs may designate capable persons from federal, state, or local 
agencies to act as their on-scene representatives. State and local 
governments, however, are not authorized to take actions under subparts 
D and E of the NCP that involve expenditures of the Oil Spill Liability 
Trust Fund or CERCLA funds unless an appropriate contract or cooperative 
agreement has been established. The basic framework for the response 
management structure is a system (e.g., a unified command system), that 
brings together the functions of the federal government, the state 
government, and the responsible party to achieve an effective and 
efficient response, where the OSC maintains authority.
    (e) The OSC/RPM should consult regularly with the RRT and NSFCC, as 
appropriate, in carrying out the NCP and keep the RRT and NSFCC, as 
appropriate, informed of activities under the NCP.
    (f) The OSC/RPM shall advise the support agency as promptly as 
possible of reported releases.
    (g) The OSC/RPM should evaluate incoming information and immediately 
advise FEMA of potential major disaster situations.
    (h) In those instances where a possible public health emergency 
exists, the OSC/RPM should notify the Department of Health and Human 
Services (HHS) representative to the RRT. Throughout response actions, 
the OSC/RPM may call upon the HHS representative for assistance in 
determining public health threats and call upon the Occupational Safety 
and Health Administration (OSHA) and HHS for assistance on worker health 
and safety issues.
    (i) All federal agencies should plan for emergencies and develop 
procedures for dealing with oil discharges and releases of hazardous 
substances, pollutants, or contaminants from vessels and

[[Page 34]]

facilities under their jurisdiction. All federal agencies, therefore, 
are responsible for designating the office that coordinates response to 
such incidents in accordance with the NCP and applicable federal 
regulations and guidelines.
    (j)(1) The OSC/RPM shall ensure that the trustees for natural 
resources are promptly notified of discharges or releases.
    (2) The OSC or RPM shall coordinate all response activities with the 
affected natural resource trustees and, for discharges of oil, the OSC 
shall consult with the affected trustees on the appropriate removal 
action to be taken.
    (k) Where the OSC/RPM becomes aware that a discharge or release may 
affect any endangered or threatened species or their habitat, the OSC/
RPM shall consult with the Department of Interior (DOI), or the 
Department of Commerce (DOC) (NOAA) and, if appropriate, the cognizant 
federal land managing agency.
    (l) The OSC/RPM is responsible for addressing worker health and 
safety concerns at a response scene, in accordance with Sec. 300.150.
    (m) The OSC shall submit pollution reports to the RRT and other 
appropriate agencies as significant developments occur during response 
actions, through communications networks or procedures agreed to by the 
RRT and covered in the RCP.
    (n) OSCs/RPMs should ensure that all appropriate public and private 
interests are kept informed and that their concerns are considered 
throughout a response, to the extent practicable, consistent with the 
requirements of Sec. 300.155 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 300.140  Multi-regional responses.

    (a) If a discharge or release moves from the area covered by one ACP 
or RCP into another area, the authority for response actions should 
likewise shift. If a discharge or release affects areas covered by two 
or more ACPs or RCPs, the response mechanisms of each applicable plan 
may be activated. In this case, response actions of all regions 
concerned shall be fully coordinated as detailed in the RCPs and ACPs.
    (b) There shall be only one OSC and/or RPM at any time during the 
course of a response operation. Should a discharge or release affect two 
or more areas, EPA, the USCG, DOD, DOE, or other lead agency, as 
appropriate, shall give prime consideration to the area vulnerable to 
the greatest threat, in determining which agency should provide the OSC 
and/or RPM. The RRT shall designate the OSC and/or RPM if the RRT member 
agencies who have response authority within the affected areas are 
unable to agree on the designation. The NRT shall designate the OSC and/
or RPM if members of one RRT or two adjacent RRTs are unable to agree on 
the designation.
    (c) Where the USCG has initially provided the OSC for response to a 
release from hazardous waste management facilities located in the 
coastal zone, responsibility for response action shall shift to EPA or 
another federal agency, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 300.145  Special teams and other assistance available to OSCs/RPMs.

    (a) The NSF is a special team established by the USCG, including the 
three USCG Strike Teams, the Public Information Assist Team (PIAT), and 
the NSFCC. The NSF is available to assist OSCs/RPMs in their 
preparedness and response duties.
    (1) The three Strike Teams (Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific) provide 
trained personnel and specialized equipment to assist the OSC in 
training for spill response, stabilizing and containing the spill, and 
in monitoring or directing the response actions of the responsible 
parties and/or contractors. The OSC has a specific team designated for 
initial contact and may contact that team directly for any assistance.
    (2) The NSFCC can provide the following support to the OSC:
    (i) Technical assistance, equipment and other resources to augment 
the OSC staff during spill response.
    (ii) Assistance in coordinating the use of private and public 
resources in support of the OSC during a response to or a threat of a 
worst case discharge of oil.
    (iii) Review of the area contingency plan, including an evaluation 
of equipment readiness and coordination among responsible public 
agencies and private organizations.

[[Page 35]]

    (iv) Assistance in locating spill response resources for both 
response and planning, using the NSFCC's national and international 
computerized inventory of spill response resources.
    (v) Coordination and evaluation of pollution response exercises.
    (vi) Inspection of district prepositioned pollution response 
equipment.
    (3) PIAT is an element of the NSFCC staff which is available to 
assist OSCs to meet the demands for public information during a response 
or exercise. Its use is encouraged any time the OSC requires outside 
public affairs support. Requests for PIAT assistance may be made through 
the NSFCC or NRC.
    (b)(1) The Environmental Response Team (ERT) is established by EPA 
in accordance with its disaster and emergency responsibilities. The ERT 
has expertise in treatment technology, biology, chemistry, hydrology, 
geology, and engineering.
    (2) The ERT can provide access to special decontamination equipment 
for chemical releases and advice to the OSC/RPM in hazard evaluation; 
risk assessment; multimedia sampling and analysis program; on-site 
safety, including development and implementation plans; cleanup 
techniques and priorities; water supply decontamination and protection; 
application of dispersants; environmental assessment; degree of cleanup 
required; and disposal of contaminated material.
    (3) The ERT also provides both introductory and intermediate level 
training courses to prepare response personnel.
    (4) OSC/RPM or RRT requests for ERT support should be made to the 
EPA representative on the RRT; EPA Headquarters, Director, Emergency 
Response Division; or the appropriate EPA regional emergency 
coordinator.
    (c) Scientific Support Coordinators (SSCs) may be designated by the 
OSC (and RPM in the case of EPA SSCs) as the principal advisors for 
scientific issues, communication with the scientific community, and 
coordination of requests for assistance from state and federal agencies 
regarding scientific studies. The SSC strives for a consensus on 
scientific issues affecting the response, but ensures that differing 
opinions within the community are communicated to the OSC/RPM.
    (1) Generally, SSCs are provided by NOAA in the coastal zones, and 
by EPA in the inland zone. OSC/RPM requests for SSC support can be made 
directly to the SSC assigned to the area or to the agency member of the 
RRT. NOAA SSCs can also be requested through NOAA's SSC program office 
in Seattle, WA. NOAA SSCs are assigned to USCG Districts and are 
supported by a scientific support team that includes expertise in 
environmental chemistry, oil slick tracking, pollutant transport 
modeling, natural resources at risk, environmental tradeoffs of 
countermeasures and cleanup, and information management.
    (2) During a response, the SSC serves on the federal OSC's/RPM's 
staff and may, at the request of the OSC/RPM, lead the scientific team 
and be responsible for providing scientific support for operational 
decisions and for coordinating on-scene scientific activity. Depending 
on the nature and location of the incident, the SSC integrates expertise 
from governmental agencies, universities, community representatives, and 
industry to assist the OSC/RPM in evaluating the hazards and potential 
effects of releases and in developing response strategies.
    (3) At the request of the OSC, the SSC may facilitate the OSC's work 
with the lead administrative trustee for natural resources to ensure 
coordination between damage assessment data collection efforts and data 
collected in support of response operations.
    (4) SSCs support the Regional Response Teams and the Area Committees 
in preparing regional and area contingency plans and in conducting spill 
training and exercises. For area plans, the SSC provides leadership for 
the synthesis and integration of environmental information required for 
spill response decisions in support of the OSC.
    (d)(1) SUPSALV has an extensive salvage/search and recovery 
equipment inventory with the requisite knowledge and expertise to 
support these operations, including specialized salvage, firefighting, 
and petroleum, oil and lubricants offloading capability.

[[Page 36]]

    (2) When possible, SUPSALV will provide equipment for training 
exercises in support of national and regional contingency planning 
objectives.
    (3) The OSC/RPM may request assistance directly from SUPSALV. Formal 
requests are routed through the Chief of Naval Operations (N312).
    (e) For marine salvage operations, OSCs/RPMs with responsibility for 
monitoring, evaluating, or supervising these activities should request 
technical assistance from DOD, the Strike Teams, or commercial salvors 
as necessary to ensure that proper actions are taken. Marine salvage 
operations generally fall into five categories: afloat salvage; offshore 
salvage; river and harbor clearance; cargo salvage; and rescue towing. 
Each category requires different knowledge and specialized types of 
equipment. The complexity of such operations may be further compounded 
by local environmental and geographic conditions. The nature of marine 
salvage and the conditions under which it occurs combine to make such 
operations imprecise, difficult, hazardous, and expensive. Thus, 
responsible parties or other persons attempting to perform such 
operations without adequate knowledge, equipment, and experience could 
aggravate, rather than relieve, the situation.
    (f) Radiological Emergency Response Teams (RERTs) have been 
established by EPA's Office of Radiation Programs (ORP) to provide 
response and support for incidents or sites containing radiological 
hazards. Expertise is available in radiation monitoring, radionuclide 
analysis, radiation health physics, and risk assessment. RERTs can 
provide on-site support including mobile monitoring laboratories for 
field analyses of samples and fixed laboratories for radiochemical 
sampling and analyses. Requests for support may be made 24 hours a day 
via the NRC or directly to the EPA Radiological Response Coordinator in 
the Office of Radiation Programs. Assistance is also available from DOE 
and other federal agencies.
    (g)(1) DRGs assist the OSC by providing technical assistance, 
personnel, and equipment, including pre-positioned equipment. Each DRG 
consists of all Coast Guard personnel and equipment, including marine 
firefighting equipment, in its district, additional pre-positioned 
equipment, and a District Response Advisory Team (DRAT) that is 
available to provide support to the OSC in the event that a spill 
exceeds local response capabilities. Each DRG:
    (i) Shall provide technical assistance, equipment, and other 
resources, as available, when requested by an OSC through the USCG 
representative to the RRT;
    (ii) Shall ensure maintenance of all USCG response equipment within 
its district;
    (iii) May provide technical assistance in the preparation of the 
ACP; and
    (iv) Shall review each of those plans that affect its area of 
geographic responsibility.
    (2) In deciding where to locate personnel and pre-positioned 
equipment, the USCG shall give priority emphasis to:
    (i) The availability of facilities for loading and unloading heavy 
or bulky equipment by barge;
    (ii) The proximity to an airport capable of supporting large 
military transport aircraft;
    (iii) The flight time to provide response to oil spills in all areas 
of the Coast Guard district with the potential for marine casualties;
    (iv) The availability of trained local personnel capable of 
responding in an oil spill emergency; and
    (v) Areas where large quantities of petroleum products are 
transported.
    (h) The NPFC is responsible for implementing those portions of Title 
I of the OPA that have been delegated to the Secretary of the department 
in which the Coast Guard is operating. The NPFC is responsible for 
addressing funding issues arising from discharges and threats of 
discharges of oil. The NPFC:
    (1) Issues Certificates of Financial Responsibility to owners and 
operators of vessels to pay for costs and damages that are incurred by 
their vessels as a result of oil discharges;
    (2) Provides funding for various response organizations for timely 
abatement and removal actions related to oil discharges;
    (3) Provides equitable compensation to claimants who sustain costs 
and

[[Page 37]]

damages from oil discharges when the responsible party fails to do so;
    (4) Recovers monies from persons liable for costs and damages 
resulting from oil discharges to the full extent of liability under the 
law; and
    (5) Provides funds to initiate natural resource damage assessments.


<R05>
Sec. 300.150  Worker health and safety.

    (a) Response actions under the NCP will comply with the provisions 
for response action worker safety and health in 29 CFR 1910.120. The NRS 
meets the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120 concerning use of an incident 
command system.
    (b) In a response action taken by a responsible party, the 
responsible party must assure that an occupational safety and health 
program consistent with 29 CFR 1910.120 is made available for the 
protection of workers at the response site.
    (c) In a response taken under the NCP by a lead agency, an 
occupational safety and health program should be made available for the 
protection of workers at the response site, consistent with, and to the 
extent required by, 29 CFR 1910.120. Contracts relating to a response 
action under the NCP should contain assurances that the contractor at 
the response site will comply with this program and with any applicable 
provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 
651 et seq.) (OSH Act) and state laws with plans approved under section 
18 of the OSH Act.
    (d) When a state, or political subdivision of a state, without an 
OSHA-approved state plan is the lead agency for response, the state or 
political subdivision must comply with standards in 40 CFR part 311, 
promulgated by EPA pursuant to section 126(f) of SARA.
    (e) Requirements, standards, and regulations of the OSH Act and of 
state OSH laws not directly referenced in paragraphs (a) through (d) of 
this section, must be complied with where applicable. Federal OSH Act 
requirements include, among other things, Construction Standards (29 CFR 
part 1926), General Industry Standards (29 CFR part 1910), and the 
general duty requirement of section 5(a)(1) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 
654(a)(1)). No action by the lead agency with respect to response 
activities under the NCP constitutes an exercise of statutory authority 
within the meaning of section 4(b)(1) of the OSH Act. All governmental 
agencies and private employers are directly responsible for the health 
and safety of their own employees.


<R05>
Sec. 300.155  Public information and community relations.

    (a) When an incident occurs, it is imperative to give the public 
prompt, accurate information on the nature of the incident and the 
actions underway to mitigate the damage. OSCs/RPMs and community 
relations personnel should ensure that all appropriate public and 
private interests are kept informed and that their concerns are 
considered throughout a response. They should coordinate with available 
public affairs/community relations resources to carry out this 
responsibility by establishing, as appropriate, a Joint Information 
Center bringing together resources from federal and state agencies and 
the responsible party.
    (b) An on-scene news office may be established to coordinate media 
relations and to issue official federal information on an incident. 
Whenever possible, it will be headed by a representative of the lead 
agency. The OSC/RPM determines the location of the on-scene news office, 
but every effort should be made to locate it near the scene of the 
incident. If a participating agency believes public interest warrants 
the issuance of statements and an on-scene news office has not been 
established, the affected agency should recommend its establishment. All 
federal news releases or statements by participating agencies should be 
cleared through the OSC/RPM. Information dissemination relating to 
natural resource damage assessment activities shall be coordinated 
through the lead administrative trustee. The designated lead 
administrative trustee may assist the OSC/RPM by disseminating 
information on issues relating to damage assessment activities. 
Following termination of removal activity, information dissemination on 
damage assessment activities shall be through the lead administrative 
trustee.

[[Page 38]]

    (c) The community relations requirements specified in Secs. 300.415, 
300.430, and 300.435 apply to removal, remedial, and enforcement actions 
and are intended to promote active communication between communities 
affected by discharges or releases and the lead agency responsible for 
response actions. Community Relations Plans (CRPs) are required by EPA 
for certain response actions. The OSC/RPM should ensure coordination 
with such plans which may be in effect at the scene of a discharge or 
release or which may need to be developed during follow-up activities.


<R05>
Sec. 300.160  Documentation and cost recovery.

    (a) For releases of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or 
contaminant, the following provisions apply:
    (1) During all phases of response, the lead agency shall complete 
and maintain documentation to support all actions taken under the NCP 
and to form the basis for cost recovery. In general, documentation shall 
be sufficient to provide the source and circumstances of the release, 
the identity of responsible parties, the response action taken, accurate 
accounting of federal, state, or private party costs incurred for 
response actions, and impacts and potential impacts to the public health 
and welfare and the environment. Where applicable, documentation shall 
state when the NRC received notification of a release of a reportable 
quantity.
    (2) The information and reports obtained by the lead agency for 
Fund-financed response actions shall, as appropriate, be transmitted to 
the chair of the RRT. Copies can then be forwarded to the NRT, members 
of the RRT, and others as appropriate.
    (3) The lead agency shall make available to the trustees of affected 
natural resources information and documentation that can assist the 
trustees in the determination of actual or potential natural resource 
injuries.
    (b) For discharges of oil, documentation and cost recovery 
provisions are described in Sec. 300.315.
    (c) Response actions undertaken by the participating agencies shall 
be carried out under existing programs and authorities when available. 
Federal agencies are to make resources available, expend funds, or 
participate in response to discharges and releases under their existing 
authority. Interagency agreements may be signed when necessary to ensure 
that the federal resources will be available for a timely response to a 
discharge or release. The ultimate decision as to the appropriateness of 
expending funds rests with the agency that is held accountable for such 
expenditures. Further funding provisions for discharges of oil are 
described in Sec. 300.335.
    (d) The Administrator of EPA and the Administrator of the Agency for 
Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) shall assure that the 
costs of health assessment or health effect studies conducted under the 
authority of CERCLA section 104(i) are documented in accordance with 
standard EPA procedures for cost recovery. Documentation shall include 
information on the nature of the hazardous substances addressed by the 
research, information concerning the locations where these substances 
have been found, and any available information on response actions taken 
concerning these substances at the location.


<R05>
Sec. 300.165  OSC reports.

    (a) As requested by the NRT or RRT, the OSC/RPM shall submit to the 
NRT or RRT a complete report on the removal operation and the actions 
taken. The RRT shall review the OSC report and send to the NRT a copy of 
the OSC report with its comments or recommendations within 30 days after 
the RRT has received the OSC report.
    (b) The OSC report shall record the situation as it developed, the 
actions taken, the resources committed, and the problems encountered.


<R05>
Sec. 300.170  Federal agency participation.

    Federal agencies listed in Sec. 300.175 have duties established by 
statute, executive order, or Presidential directive which may apply to 
federal response actions following, or in prevention of, the discharge 
of oil or release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. 
Some of these agencies also have duties relating to the restoration,

[[Page 39]]

rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of equivalent natural 
resources injured or lost as a result of such discharge or release as 
described in subpart G of this part. The NRT, RRT, and Area Committee 
organizational structure, and the NCP, RCPs and ACPs, described in 
Sec. 300.210, provide for agencies to coordinate with each other in 
carrying out these duties.
    (a) Federal agencies may be called upon by an OSC/RPM during 
response planning and implementation to provide assistance in their 
respective areas of expertise, as described in Sec. 300.175, consistent 
with the agencies' capabilities and authorities.
    (b) In addition to their general responsibilities, federal agencies 
should:
    (1) Make necessary information available to the Secretary of the 
NRT, RRTs, Area Committees, and OSCs/RPMs.
    (2) Provide representatives to the NRT and RRTs and otherwise assist 
RRTs and OSCs, as necessary, in formulating RCPs and ACPs.
    (3) Inform the NRT, RRTs, and Area Committees, consistent with 
national security considerations, of changes in the availability of 
resources that would affect the operations implemented under the NCP.
    (c) All federal agencies are responsible for reporting releases of 
hazardous substances from facilities or vessels under their jurisdiction 
or control in accordance with section 103 of CERCLA.
    (d) All federal agencies are encouraged to report releases of 
pollutants or contaminants and must report discharges of oil, as 
required in 40 CFR part 110, from facilities or vessels under their 
jurisdiction or control to the NRC.


<R05>
Sec. 300.175  Federal agencies: additional responsibilities and assistance.

    (a) During preparedness planning or in an actual response, various 
federal agencies may be called upon to provide assistance in their 
respective areas of expertise, as indicated in paragraph (b) of this 
section, consistent with agency legal authorities and capabilities.
    (b) The federal agencies include:
    (1) USCG, as provided in 14 U.S.C. 1-3, is an agency in DOT, except 
when operating as an agency in the United States Navy (USN) in time of 
war. The USCG provides the NRT vice chair, co-chairs for the standing 
RRTs, and predesignated OSCs for the coastal zone, as described in 
Sec. 300.120(a)(1). The USCG maintains continuously manned facilities 
which can be used for command, control, and surveillance of oil 
discharges and hazardous substance releases occurring in the coastal 
zone. The USCG also offers expertise in domestic and international 
fields of port safety and security, maritime law enforcement, ship 
navigation and construction, and the manning, operation, and safety of 
vessels and marine facilities. The USCG may enter into a contract or 
cooperative agreement with the appropriate state in order to implement a 
response action.
    (2) EPA chairs the NRT and co-chairs, with the USCG, the standing 
RRTs; provides predesignated OSCs for all inland areas for which an ACP 
is required under CWA section 311(j) and for discharges and releases 
occurring in the inland zone and RPMs for remedial actions except as 
otherwise provided; and generally provides the SSC for responses in the 
inland zone. EPA provides expertise on human health and ecological 
effects of oil discharges or releases of hazardous substances, 
pollutants, or contaminants; ecological and human health risk assessment 
methods; and environmental pollution control techniques. Access to EPA's 
scientific expertise can be facilitated through the EPA representative 
to the Research and Development Committee of the National Response Team; 
the EPA Office of Research and Development's Superfund Technical 
Liaisons or Regional Scientists located in EPA Regional offices; or 
through EPA's Office of Science Planning and Regulatory Evaluation. EPA 
also provides legal expertise on the interpretation of CERCLA and other 
environmental statutes. EPA may enter into a contract or cooperative 
agreement with the appropriate state in order to implement a response 
action.

[[Page 40]]

    (3) FEMA provides guidance, policy and program advice, and technical 
assistance in hazardous materials, chemical, and radiological emergency 
preparedness activities (including planning, training, and exercising). 
FEMA's primary point of contact for administering financial and 
technical assistance to state and local governments to support their 
efforts to develop and maintain an effective emergency management and 
response capability is the Preparedness, Training, and Exercises 
Directorate.
    (4) DOD has responsibility to take all action necessary with respect 
to releases where either the release is on, or the sole source of the 
release is from, any facility or vessel under the jurisdiction, custody, 
or control of DOD. In addition to those capabilities provided by 
SUPSALV, DOD may also, consistent with its operational requirements and 
upon request of the OSC, provide locally deployed USN oil spill 
equipment and provide assistance to other federal agencies on request. 
The following two branches of DOD have particularly relevant expertise:
    (i) The United States Army Corps of Engineers has specialized 
equipment and personnel for maintaining navigation channels, for 
removing navigation obstructions, for accomplishing structural repairs, 
and for performing maintenance to hydropower electric generating 
equipment. The Corps can also provide design services, perform 
construction, and provide contract writing and contract administrative 
services for other federal agencies.
    (ii) The U.S. Navy Supervisor of Salvage (SUPSALV) is the branch of 
service within DOD most knowledgeable and experienced in ship salvage, 
shipboard damage control, and diving. The USN has an extensive array of 
specialized equipment and personnel available for use in these areas as 
well as specialized containment, collection, and removal equipment 
specifically designed for salvage-related and open-sea pollution 
incidents.
    (5) DOE generally provides designated OSCs/RPMs that are responsible 
for taking all response actions with respect to releases where either 
the release is on, or the sole source of the release is from, any 
facility or vessel under its jurisdiction, custody, or control, 
including vessels bareboat-chartered and operated. In addition, under 
the FRERP, DOE provides advice and assistance to other OSCs/RPMs for 
emergency actions essential for the control of immediate radiological 
hazards. Incidents that qualify for DOE radiological advice and 
assistance are those believed to involve source, by-product, or special 
nuclear material or other ionizing radiation sources, including radium, 
and other naturally occurring radionuclides, as well as particle 
accelerators. Assistance is available through direct contact with the 
appropriate DOE Radiological Assistance Program Regional Office.
    (6) The Department of Agriculture (USDA) has scientific and 
technical capability to measure, evaluate, and monitor, either on the 
ground or by use of aircraft, situations where natural resources 
including soil, water, wildlife, and vegetation have been impacted by 
fire, insects and diseases, floods, hazardous substances, and other 
natural or man-caused emergencies. The USDA may be contacted through 
Forest Service emergency staff officers who are the designated members 
of the RRT. Agencies within USDA have relevant capabilities and 
expertise as follows:
    (i) The Forest Service has responsibility for protection and 
management of national forests and national grasslands. The Forest 
Service has personnel, laboratory, and field capability to measure, 
evaluate, monitor, and control as needed, releases of pesticides and 
other hazardous substances on lands under its jurisdiction.
    (ii) The Agriculture Research Service (ARS) administers an applied 
and developmental research program in animal and plant protection and 
production; the use and improvement of soil, water, and air; the 
processing, storage, and distribution of farm products; and human 
nutrition. The ARS has the capabilities to provide regulation of, and 
evaluation and training for, employees exposed to biological, chemical, 
radiological, and industrial hazards. In emergency situations, the ARS 
can identify, control, and abate pollution in the areas of air, soil, 
wastes, pesticides, radiation, and toxic substances for ARS facilities.

[[Page 41]]

    (iii) The Soil Conservation Service (SCS) has personnel in nearly 
every county in the nation who are knowledgeable in soil, agronomy, 
engineering, and biology. These personnel can help to predict the 
effects of pollutants on soil and their movements over and through 
soils. Technical specialists can assist in identifying potential 
hazardous waste sites and provide review and advice on plans for 
remedial measures.
    (iv) The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) can 
respond in an emergency to regulate movement of diseased or infected 
organisms to prevent the spread and contamination of nonaffected areas.
    (v) The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has responsibility 
to prevent meat and poultry products contaminated with harmful 
substances from entering human food channels. In emergencies, the FSIS 
works with other federal and state agencies to establish acceptability 
for slaughter of exposed or potentially exposed animals and their 
products. In addition they are charged with managing the Federal 
Radiological Emergency Response Program for the USDA.
    (7) DOC, through NOAA, provides scientific support for response and 
contingency planning in coastal and marine areas, including assessments 
of the hazards that may be involved, predictions of movement and 
dispersion of oil and hazardous substances through trajectory modeling, 
and information on the sensitivity of coastal environments to oil and 
hazardous substances and associated clean-up and mitigation methods; 
provides expertise on living marine resources and their habitats, 
including endangered species, marine mammals and National Marine 
Sanctuary ecosystems; provides information on actual and predicted 
meteorological, hydrological, ice, and oceanographic conditions for 
marine, coastal, and inland waters, and tide and circulation data for 
coastal and territorial waters and for the Great Lakes.
    (8) HHS assists with the assessment, preservation, and protection of 
human health and helps ensure the availability of essential human 
services. HHS provides technical and nontechnical assistance in the form 
of advice, guidance, and resources to other federal agencies as well as 
state and local governments.
    (i) The principal HHS response comes from the U.S. Public Health 
Service and is coordinated from the Office of the Assistant Secretary 
for Health, and various Public Health Service regional offices. Within 
the Public Health Service, the primary response to a hazardous materials 
emergency comes from Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry 
(ATSDR) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Both ATSDR and CDC 
have a 24-hour emergency response capability wherein scientific and 
technical personnel are available to provide technical assistance to the 
lead federal agency and state and local response agencies on human 
health threat assessment and analysis, and exposure prevention and 
mitigation. Such assistance is used for situations requiring evacuation 
of affected areas, human exposure to hazardous materials, and technical 
advice on mitigation and prevention. CDC takes the lead during petroleum 
releases regulated under the CWA and OPA while ATSDR takes the lead 
during chemical releases under CERCLA. Both agencies are mutually 
supportive.
    (ii) Other Public Health Service agencies involved in support during 
hazardous materials incidents either directly or through ATSDR/CDC 
include the Food and Drug Administration, the Health Resources and 
Services Administration, the Indian Health Service, and the National 
Institutes of Health.
    (iii) Statutory authority for HHS/National Institutes for 
Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) involvement in hazardous materials 
accident prevention is non-regulatory in nature and focused on two 
primary areas for preventing community and worker exposure to hazardous 
materials releases: Worker safety training and basic research 
activities. Under section 126 of SARA, NIEHS is given statutory 
authority for supporting development of curricula and model training 
programs for waste workers and chemical emergency responders.
    Under section 118(b) of the Hazardous Materials Transportation and 
Uniform Safety Act (HMTUSA) (49 U.S.C. 1802 et seq.), NIEHS also 
administers the

[[Page 42]]

Hazmat Employee Training Program to prepare curricula and training for 
hazardous materials transportation workers. In the basic research arena, 
NIEHS is authorized under section 311 of SARA to conduct a hazardous 
substance basic research and training program to evaluate toxic effects 
and assess human health risks from accidental releases of hazardous 
materials. Under Title IX, section 901(h) of the Clean Air Act 
Amendments, NIEHS also is authorized to conduct basic research on air 
pollutants, as well as train physicians in environmental health. Federal 
research and training in hazardous materials release prevention 
represents an important non-regulatory activity and supplements ongoing 
private sector programs.
    (9) DOI may be contacted through Regional Environmental Officers 
(REOs), who are the designated members of RRTs. Department land managers 
have jurisdiction over the national park system, national wildlife 
refuges and fish hatcheries, the public lands, and certain water 
projects in western states. In addition, bureaus and offices have 
relevant expertise as follows:
    (i) United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and other 
Bureaus: Anadromous and certain other fishes and wildlife, including 
endangered and threatened species, migratory birds, and certain marine 
mammals; waters and wetlands; and effects on natural resources.
    (ii) The National Biological Survey performs research in support of 
biological resource management; inventories, monitors, and reports on 
the status and trends in the Nation's biotic resources; and transfers 
the information gained in research and monitoring to resource managers 
and others concerned with the care, use, and conservation of the 
Nation's natural resources. The National Biological Survey has 
laboratory/research facilities.
    (iii) Geological Survey: Geology, hydrology (ground water and 
surface water), and natural hazards.
    (iv) Bureau of Land Management: Minerals, soils, vegetation, 
wildlife, habitat, archaeology, and wilderness; and hazardous materials.
    (v) Minerals Management Service: Oversight of offshore oil and gas 
exploration and production facilities and associated pipelines and 
pipeline facilities under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and the 
CWA; oil spill response technology research; and establishing oil 
discharge contingency planning requirements for offshore facilities.

hazardous substances and technical expertise in metals and metallurgy 
relevant to site cleanup.
    (vii) Office of Surface Mining: Coal mine wastes and land 
reclamation.
    (viii) National Park Service: General biological, natural, and 
cultural resource managers to evaluate, measure, monitor, and contain 
threats to park system lands and resources; archaeological and 
historical expertise in protection, preservation, evaluation, impact 
mitigation, and restoration of cultural resources; emergency personnel.
    (ix) Bureau of Reclamation: Operation and maintenance of water 
projects in the West; engineering and hydrology; and reservoirs.
    (x) Bureau of Indian Affairs: Coordination of activities affecting 
Indian lands; assistance in identifying Indian tribal government 
officials.
    (xi) Office of Territorial Affairs: Assistance in implementing the 
NCP in American Samoa, Guam, the Pacific Island Governments, the 
Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands.
    (10) The Department of Justice (DOJ) can provide expert advice on 
complicated legal questions arising from discharges or releases, and 
federal agency responses. In addition, the DOJ represents the federal 
government, including its agencies, in litigation relating to such 
discharges or releases. Other legal issues or questions shall be 
directed to the federal agency counsel for the agency providing the OSC/
RPM for the response.
    (11) The Department of Labor (DOL), through OSHA and the states 
operating plans approved under section 18 of the OSH Act, has authority 
to conduct

[[Page 43]]

safety and health inspections of hazardous waste sites to assure that 
employees are being protected and to determine if the site is in 
compliance with:
    (i) Safety and health standards and regulations promulgated by OSHA 
(or the states) in accordance with section 126 of SARA and all other 
applicable standards; and
    (ii) Regulations promulgated under the OSH Act and its general duty 
clause. OSHA inspections may be self-generated, consistent with its 
program operations and objectives, or may be conducted in response to 
requests from EPA or another lead agency, or in response to accidents or 
employee complaints. OSHA may also conduct inspections at hazardous 
waste sites in those states with approved plans that choose not to 
exercise their jurisdiction to inspect such sites. On request, OSHA will 
provide advice and consultation to EPA and other NRT/RRT agencies as 
well as to the OSC/RPM regarding hazards to persons engaged in response 
activities. OSHA may also take any other action necessary to assure that 
employees are properly protected at such response activities. Any 
questions about occupational safety and health at these sites may be 
referred to the OSHA Regional Office.
    (12) DOT provides response expertise pertaining to transportation of 
oil or hazardous substances by all modes of transportation. Through the 
Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), DOT offers 
expertise in the requirements for packaging, handling, and transporting 
regulated hazardous materials. DOT, through RSPA, establishes oil 
discharge contingency planning requirements for pipelines, transport by 
rail and containers or bulk transport of oil.
    (13) The Department of State (DOS) will lead in the development of 
international joint contingency plans. It will also help to coordinate 
an international response when discharges or releases cross 
international boundaries or involve foreign flag vessels. Additionally, 
DOS will coordinate requests for assistance from foreign governments and 
U.S. proposals for conducting research at incidents that occur in waters 
of other countries.
    (14) The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will respond, as appropriate, 
to releases of radioactive materials by its licensees, in accordance 
with the NRC Incident Response Plan (NUREG-0728) to monitor the actions 
of those licensees and assure that the public health and environment are 
protected and adequate recovery operations are instituted. The Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission will keep EPA informed of any significant actual 
or potential releases in accordance with procedural agreements. In 
addition, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will provide advice to the 
OSC/RPM when assistance is required in identifying the source and 
character of other hazardous substance releases where the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission has licensing authority for activities utilizing 
radioactive materials.
    (15) The General Services Administration (GSA) provides logistic and 
telecommunications support to federal agencies. During an emergency 
situation, GSA quickly responds to aid state and local governments as 
directed by other federal agencies. The type of support provided might 
include leasing and furnishing office space, setting up 
telecommunications and transportation services, and advisory assistance.

Sec. 300.180  State and local participation in response.

    (a) Each state governor is requested to designate one state office/
representative to represent the state on the appropriate RRT. The 
state's office/representative may participate fully in all activities of 
the appropriate RRT. Each state governor is also requested to designate 
a lead state agency that will direct state-lead response operations. 
This agency is responsible for designating the lead state response 
official for federal and/or state-lead response actions, and 
coordinating/communicating with any other state agencies, as 
appropriate. Local governments are invited to participate in activities 
on the appropriate RRT as may be provided by state law or arranged by 
the state's representative. Indian tribes wishing to participate should 
assign one person or office to represent the tribal government on the 
appropriate RRT.

[[Page 44]]

    (b) Appropriate local and state officials (including Indian tribes) 
will participate as part of the response structure as provided in the 
ACP.
    (c) In addition to meeting the requirements for local emergency 
plans under SARA section 303, state and local government agencies are 
encouraged to include contingency planning for responses, consistent 
with the NCP, RCP, and ACP in all emergency and disaster planning.
    (d) For facilities not addressed under CERCLA or the CWA, states are 
encouraged to undertake response actions themselves or to use their 
authorities to compel potentially responsible parties to undertake 
response actions.
    (e) States are encouraged to enter into cooperative agreements 
pursuant to sections 104 (c)(3) and (d) of CERCLA to enable them to 
undertake actions authorized under subpart E of the NCP. Requirements 
for entering into these agreements are included in subpart F of the NCP. 
A state agency that acts pursuant to such agreements is referred to as 
the lead agency. In the event there is no cooperative agreement, the 
lead agency can be designated in a SMOA or other agreement.
    (f) Because state and local public safety organizations would 
normally be the first government representatives at the scene of a 
discharge or release, they are expected to initiate public safety 
measures that are necessary to protect public health and welfare and 
that are consistent with containment and cleanup requirements in the 
NCP, and are responsible for directing evacuations pursuant to existing 
state or local procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 300.185  Nongovernmental participation.

    (a) Industry groups, academic organizations, and others are 
encouraged to commit resources for response operations. Specific 
commitments should be listed in the RCP and ACP. Those entities required 
to develop tank vessel and facility response plans under CWA section 
311(j) must be able to respond to a worst case discharge to the maximum 
extent practicable, and shall commit sufficient resources to implement 
other aspects of those plans in accordance with the requirements of 30 
CFR part 254, 33 CFR parts 150, 154, and 155; 40 CFR part 112; and 49 
CFR parts 171 and 194.
    (b) The technical and scientific information generated by the local 
community, along with information from federal, state, and local 
governments, should be used to assist the OSC/RPM in devising response 
strategies where effective standard techniques are unavailable. Such 
information and strategies will be incorporated into the ACP, as 
appropriate. The SSC may act as liaison between the OSC/RPM and such 
interested organizations.
    (c) ACPs shall establish procedures to allow for well organized, 
worthwhile, and safe use of volunteers, including compliance with 
Sec. 300.150 regarding worker health and safety. ACPs should provide for 
the direction of volunteers by the OSC/RPM or by other federal, state, 
or local officials knowledgeable in contingency operations and capable 
of providing leadership. ACPs also should identify specific areas in 
which volunteers can be used, such as beach surveillance, logistical 
support, and bird and wildlife treatment. Unless specifically requested 
by the OSC/RPM, volunteers generally should not be used for physical 
removal or remedial activities. If, in the judgment of the OSC/RPM, 
dangerous conditions exist, volunteers shall be restricted from on-scene 
operations.
    (d) Nongovernmental participation must be in compliance with the 
requirements of subpart H of this part if any recovery of costs will be 
sought.

    This subpart summarizes emergency preparedness activities relating 
to discharges of oil and releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, 
or contaminants; describes the three levels of contingency planning 
under the national response system; and cross-references state and local 
emergency preparedness activities under SARA Title III, also known as 
the ``Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know

[[Page 45]]

Act of 1986'' but referred to herein as ``Title III.'' Regulations 
implementing Title III are codified at 40 CFR Subchapter J.


<R05>
Sec. 300.205  Planning and coordination structure.

    (a) National. As described in Sec. 300.110, the NRT is responsible 
for national planning and coordination.
    (b) Regional. As described in Sec. 300.115, the RRTs are responsible 
for regional planning and coordination.
    (c) Area. As required by section 311(j) of the CWA, under the 
direction of the federal OSC for its area, Area Committees comprising 
qualified personnel of federal, state, and local agencies shall be 
responsible for:
    (1) Preparing an ACP for their areas (as described in 
Sec. 300.210(c));
    (2) Working with appropriate federal, state, and local officials to 
enhance the contingency planning of those officials and to assure pre-
planning of joint response efforts, including appropriate procedures for 
mechanical recovery, dispersal, shoreline cleanup, protection of 
sensitive environmental areas, and protection, rescue, and 
rehabilitation of fisheries and wildlife; and
    (3) Working with appropriate federal, state, and local officials to 
expedite decisions for the use of dispersants and other mitigating 
substances and devices.
    (d) State. As provided by sections 301 and 303 of Title III, the 
SERC of each state, appointed by the Governor, is to designate emergency 
planning districts, appoint Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs), 
supervise and coordinate their activities, and review local emergency 
response plans, which are described in Sec. 300.215. The SERC also is to 
establish procedures for receiving and processing requests from the 
public for information generated by Title III reporting requirements and 
to designate an official to serve as coordinator for information.
    (e) Local. As provided by sections 301 and 303 of Title III, 
emergency planning districts are designated by the SERC in order to 
facilitate the preparation and implementation of emergency plans. Each 
LEPC is to prepare a local emergency response plan for the emergency 
planning district and establish procedures for receiving and processing 
requests from the public for information generated by Title III 
reporting requirements. The LEPC is to appoint a chair and establish 
rules for the LEPC. The LEPC is to designate an official to serve as 
coordinator for information and designate in its plan a community 
emergency coordinator.
    (f) As required by section 311(j)(5) of the CWA, a tank vessel, as 
defined under section 2101 of title 46, U.S. Code, an offshore facility, 
and an onshore facility that, because of its location, could reasonably 
be expected to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging 
into or on the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or exclusive 
economic zone must prepare and submit a plan for responding, to the 
maximum extent practicable, to a worst case discharge, and to a 
substantial threat of such a discharge, of oil or a hazardous substance.
    (g) The relationship of these plans is described in Figure 4.

<R05>
Sec. 300.210  Federal contingency plans.

    There are three levels of contingency plans under the national 
response system: The National Contingency Plan, RCPs, and ACPs. These 
plans are available for inspection at EPA regional offices or USCG 
district offices. Addresses and telephone numbers for these offices may 
be found in the United States Government Manual, issued annually, or in 
local telephone directories.
    (a) The National Contingency Plan. The purpose and objectives, 
authority, and scope of the NCP are described in Secs. 300.1 through 
300.3.
    (b) Regional Contingency Plans. The RRTs, working with the states, 
shall develop federal RCPs for each standard federal region, Alaska, 
Oceania in the Pacific, and the Caribbean to coordinate timely, 
effective response by various federal agencies and other organizations 
to discharges of oil or releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or 
contaminants. RCPs shall, as appropriate, include information on all 
useful facilities and resources in the region, from government, 
commercial, academic, and other sources. To the greatest extent 
possible, RCPs shall follow the format of the NCP and be coordinated 
with state emergency response plans, ACPs, which are described in 
Sec. 300.210(c), and Title III local emergency response plans, which are 
described in Sec. 300.215. Such coordination should be accomplished by 
working with the SERCs in the region covered by the RCP. RCPs shall 
contain lines of demarcation between the inland and coastal zones, as 
mutually agreed upon by USCG and EPA.
    (c) Area Contingency Plans. (1) Under the direction of an OSC and 
subject to approval by the lead agency, each Area Committee, in 
consultation with the appropriate RRTs, Coast Guard DRGs, the NSFCC, 
SSCs, LEPCs, and SERCs, shall develop an ACP for its designated area. 
This plan, when implemented in conjunction with other provisions of the 
NCP, shall be adequate to remove a worst case discharge under 
Sec. 300.324, and to mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of such a 
discharge, from a vessel, offshore facility, or onshore facility 
operating in or near the area.
    (2) The areas of responsibility may include several Title III local 
planning districts, or parts of such districts. In developing the ACP, 
the OSC shall coordinate with affected SERCs and LEPCs. The ACP shall 
provide for a well coordinated response that is integrated and 
compatible, to the greatest extent possible, with all appropriate 
response plans of state, local, and non-federal entities, and especially 
with Title III local emergency response plans.
    (3) The ACP shall include the following:
    (i) A description of the area covered by the plan, including the 
areas of special economic or environmental importance that might be 
damaged by a discharge;
    (ii) A description in detail of the responsibilities of an owner or 
operator and of federal, state, and local agencies in removing a 
discharge, and in mitigating or preventing a substantial threat of a 
discharge;
    (iii) A list of equipment (including firefighting equipment), 
dispersants, or other mitigating substances and devices, and personnel 
available to an owner or operator and federal, state, and local 
agencies, to ensure an effective and immediate removal of a discharge, 
and to ensure mitigation or prevention of a substantial threat of a 
discharge (this may be provided in an appendix or by reference to other 
relevant emergency plans (e.g., state or LEPC plans), which may include 
such equipment lists);
    (iv) A description of procedures to be followed for obtaining an 
expedited decision regarding the use of dispersants; and
    (v) A detailed description of how the plan is integrated into other 
ACPs and tank vessel, offshore facility, and onshore facility response 
plans approved by the President, and into operating procedures of the 
NSFCC.
    (4)(i) In order to provide for coordinated, immediate and effective 
protection, rescue, and rehabilitation of, and minimization of risk of 
injury to, fish and wildlife resources and habitat, Area Committees 
shall incorporate into each ACP a detailed annex containing a Fish and 
Wildlife and Sensitive Environments Plan that is consistent with the RCP 
and NCP. The annex shall be prepared in consultation

[[Page 48]]

with the USFWS and NOAA and other interested natural resource management 
agencies and parties. It shall address fish and wildlife resources and 
their habitat, and shall include other areas considered sensitive 
environments in a separate section of the annex, based upon Area 
Committee recommendations. The annex will provide the necessary 
information and procedures to immediately and effectively respond to 
discharges that may adversely affect fish and wildlife and their habitat 
and sensitive environments, including provisions for a response to a 
worst case discharge. Such information shall include the identification 
of appropriate agencies and their responsibilities, procedures to notify 
these agencies following a discharge or threat of a discharge, protocols 
for obtaining required fish and wildlife permits and other necessary 
permits, and provisions to ensure compatibility of annex-related 
activities with removal operations.
    (ii) The annex shall:
    (A) Identify and establish priorities for fish and wildlife 
resources and their habitats and other important sensitive areas 
requiring protection from any direct or indirect effects from discharges 
that may occur. These effects include, but are not limited to, any 
seasonal or historical use, as well as all critical, special, 
significant, or otherwise designated protected areas.
    (B) Provide a mechanism to be used during a spill response for 
timely identification of protection priorities of those fish and 
wildlife resources and habitats and sensitive environmental areas that 
may be threatened or injured by a discharge. These include as 
appropriate, not only marine and freshwater species, habitats, and their 
food sources, but also terrestrial wildlife and their habitats that may 
be affected directly by onshore oil or indirectly by oil-related 
factors, such as loss or contamination of forage. The mechanism shall 
also provide for expeditious evaluation and appropriate consultations on 
the effects to fish and wildlife, their habitat, and other sensitive 
environments from the application of chemical countermeasures or other 
countermeasures not addressed under paragraph (e)(4)(iii).
    (C) Identify potential environmental effects on fish and wildlife, 
their habitat, and other sensitive environments resulting from removal 
actions or countermeasures, including the option of no removal. Based on 
this evaluation of potential environmental effects, the annex should 
establish priorities for application of countermeasure and removal 
actions to habitats within the geographic region of the ACP. The annex 
should establish methods to minimize the identified effects on fish and 
wildlife because of response activities, including, but not limited to: 
Disturbance of sensitive areas and habitats; illegal or inadvertent 
taking or disturbance of fish and wildlife or specimens by response 
personnel; and fish and wildlife, their habitat, and environmentally 
sensitive areas coming in contact with various cleaning or 
bioremediation agents. Furthermore, the annex should identify the areas 
where the movement of oiled debris may pose a risk to resident, 
transient, or migratory fish and wildlife, and other sensitive 
environments and should discuss measures to be considered for removing 
such oiled debris in a timely fashion to reduce such risk.
    (D) Provide for pre-approval of application of specific 
countermeasures or removal actions that, if expeditiously applied, will 
minimize adverse spill-induced impacts to fish and wildlife resources, 
their habitat, and other sensitive environments. Such pre-approval plans 
must be consistent with paragraphs (c)(4)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section 
and subpart J requirements, and must have the concurrence of the natural 
resource trustees.
    (E) Provide monitoring plan(s) to evaluate the effectiveness of 
different countermeasures or removal actions in protecting the 
environment. Monitoring should include ``set-aside'' or ``control'' 
areas, where no mitigative actions are taken.
    (F) Identify and plan for the acquisition and utilization of 
necessary response capabilities for protection, rescue, and 
rehabilitation of fish and wildlife resources and habitat. This may 
include appropriately permitted private organizations and individuals 
with appropriate expertise and experience. The

[[Page 49]]

suitable organizations should be identified in cooperation with natural 
resource law enforcement agencies. Such capabilities shall include, but 
not be limited to, identification of facilities and equipment necessary 
for deterring sensitive fish and wildlife from entering oiled areas, and 
for capturing, holding, cleaning, and releasing injured wildlife. Plans 
for the provision of such capabilities shall ensure that there is no 
interference with other OSC removal operations.
    (G) Identify appropriate federal and state agency contacts and 
alternates responsible for coordination of fish and wildlife rescue and 
rehabilitation and protection of sensitive environments; identify and 
provide for required fish and wildlife handling and rehabilitation 
permits necessary under federal and state laws; and provide guidance on 
the implementation of law enforcement requirements included under 
current federal and state laws and corresponding regulations. 
Requirements include, but are not limited to procedures regarding the 
capture, transport, rehabilitation, and release of wildlife exposed to 
or threatened by oil, and disposal of contaminated carcasses of 
wildlife.
    (H) Identify and secure the means for providing, if needed, the 
minimum required OSHA and EPA training for volunteers, including those 
who assist with injured wildlife.
    (I) Define the requirements for evaluating the compatibility between 
this annex and non-federal response plans (including those of vessels, 
facilities, and pipelines) on issues affecting fish and wildlife, their 
habitat, and sensitive environments.


<R05>
Sec. 300.211  OPA facility and vessel response plans.

    This section describes and cross-references the regulations that 
implement section 311(j)(5) of the CWA. A tank vessel, as defined under 
section 2101 of title 46, U.S. Code, an offshore facility, and an 
onshore facility that, because of its location, could reasonably expect 
to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging into or on 
the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or exclusive economic zone 
must prepare and submit a plan for responding, to the maximum extent 
practicable, to a worst case discharge, and to a substantial threat of 
such a discharge, of oil or a hazardous substance. These response plans 
are required to be consistent with applicable Area Contingency Plans. 
These regulations are codified as follows:
    (a) For tank vessels, these regulations are codified in 33 CFR part 
155;
    (b) For offshore facilities, these regulations are codified in 30 
CFR part 254;
    (c) For non-transportation related onshore facilities, these 
regulations are codified in 40 CFR 112.20;
    (d) For transportation-related onshore facilities, these regulations 
are codified in 33 CFR part 154;
    (e) For pipeline facilities, these regulations are codified in 49 
CFR part 194; and
    (f) For rolling stock, these regulations are codified in 49 CFR part 
106 et al.


<R05>
Sec. 300.212  Area response drills.

    The OSC periodically shall conduct drills of removal capability 
(including fish and wildlife response capability), without prior notice, 
in areas for which ACPs are required by Sec. 300.210(c) and under 
relevant tank vessel and facility response plans.


<R05>
Sec. 300.215  Title III local emergency response plans.

    This section describes and cross-references the regulations that 
implement Title III. These regulations are codified at 40 CFR part 355.
    (a) Each LEPC is to prepare an emergency response plan in accordance 
with section 303 of Title III and review the plan once a year, or more 
frequently as changed circumstances in the community or at any facility 
may require. Such Title III local emergency response plans should be 
closely coordinated with applicable federal ACPs and state emergency 
response plans.

         Subpart D--Operational Response Phases for Oil Removal

    Source: 59 FR 47444, Sept. 15, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 300.300  Phase I--Discovery or notification.

    (a) A discharge of oil may be discovered through:
    (1) A report submitted by the person in charge of a vessel or 
facility, in accordance with statutory requirements;
    (2) Deliberate search by patrols;
    (3) Random or incidental observation by government agencies or the 
public; or
    (4) Other sources.
    (b) Any person in charge of a vessel or a facility shall, as soon as 
he or she has knowledge of any discharge from such vessel or facility in 
violation of section 311(b)(3) of the CWA, immediately notify the NRC. 
If direct reporting to the NRC is not practicable, reports may be made 
to the USCG or EPA predesignated OSC for the geographic area where the 
discharge occurs. The EPA predesignated OSC may also be contacted 
through the regional 24-hour emergency response telephone number. All 
such reports shall be promptly relayed to the NRC. If it is not possible 
to notify the NRC or predesignated OSC immediately, reports may be made 
immediately to the nearest Coast Guard unit. In any event such person in 
charge of the vessel or facility shall notify the NRC as soon as 
possible.
    (c) Any other person shall, as appropriate, notify the NRC of a 
discharge of oil.
    (d) Upon receipt of a notification of discharge, the NRC shall 
promptly notify the OSC. The OSC shall ensure notification of the 
appropriate state agency of any state which is, or may reasonably be 
expected to be, affected by the discharge. The OSC shall then proceed 
with the following phases as outlined in the RCP and ACP.


<R05>
Sec. 300.305  Phase II--Preliminary assessment and initiation of action.

    (a) The OSC is responsible for promptly initiating a preliminary 
assessment.
    (b) The preliminary assessment shall be conducted using available 
information, supplemented where necessary and possible by an on-scene 
inspection. The OSC shall undertake actions to:
    (1) Evaluate the magnitude and severity of the discharge or threat 
to public health or welfare of the United States or the environment;
    (2) Assess the feasibility of removal; and
    (3) To the extent practicable, identify potentially responsible 
parties.
    (c) Where practicable, the framework for the response management 
structure is a system (e.g., a unified command system), that brings 
together the functions of the federal government, the state government, 
and the responsible party to achieve an effective and efficient 
response, where the OSC maintains authority.
    (d) Except in a case when the OSC is required to direct the response 
to a discharge that may pose a substantial threat to the public health 
or welfare of the United States (including but not limited to fish, 
shellfish, wildlife, other natural resources, and the public and private 
beaches and shorelines of the United States), the OSC may allow the 
responsible party to voluntarily and promptly perform removal actions, 
provided the OSC determines such actions will ensure an effective and 
immediate removal of the discharge or mitigation or prevention of a 
substantial threat of a discharge. If the responsible party does conduct 
the removal, the OSC shall ensure adequate surveillance over whatever 
actions are initiated. If effective actions are not being taken to 
eliminate the threat, or if removal is not being properly done, the OSC 
should, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, so advise the 
responsible party. If the responsible party does not respond properly 
the OSC shall take appropriate response actions and should notify the 
responsible party of the potential liability for federal response costs 
incurred by the OSC pursuant to the OPA and CWA. Where practicable, 
continuing efforts should be made to encourage response by responsible 
parties.
    (1) In carrying out a response under this section, the OSC may:

[[Page 51]]

    (i) Remove or arrange for the removal of a discharge, and mitigate 
or prevent a substantial threat of a discharge, at any time;
    (ii) Direct or monitor all federal, state, and private actions to 
remove a discharge; and
    (iii) Remove and, if necessary, destroy a vessel discharging, or 
threatening to discharge, by whatever means are available.
    (2) If the discharge results in a substantial threat to the public 
health or welfare of the United States (including, but not limited to 
fish, shellfish, wildlife, other natural resources, and the public and 
private beaches and shorelines of the United States), the OSC must 
direct all response efforts, as provided in Sec. 300.322(b) of this 
part. The OSC should declare as expeditiously as practicable to spill 
response participants that the federal government will direct the 
response. The OSC may act without regard to any other provision of the 
law governing contracting procedures or employment of personnel by the 
federal government in removing or arranging for the removal of such a 
discharge.
    (e) The OSC shall ensure that the natural resource trustees are 
promptly notified in the event of any discharge of oil, to the maximum 
extent practicable as provided in the Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive 
Environments Plan annex to the ACP for the area in which the discharge 
occurs. The OSC and the trustees shall coordinate assessments, 
evaluations, investigations, and planning with respect to appropriate 
removal actions. The OSC shall consult with the affected trustees on the 
appropriate removal action to be taken. The trustees will provide timely 
advice concerning recommended actions with regard to trustee resources 
potentially affected. The trustees also will assure that the OSC is 
informed of their activities in natural resource damage assessment that 
may affect response operations. The trustees shall assure, through the 
lead administrative trustee, that all data from the natural resource 
damage assessment activities that may support more effective operational 
decisions are provided in a timely manner to the OSC. When circumstances 
permit, the OSC shall share the use of non-monetary response resources 
(i.e., personnel and equipment) with the trustees, provided trustee 
activities do not interfere with response actions. The lead 
administrative trustee facilitates effective and efficient communication 
between the OSC and the other trustees during response operations and is 
responsible for applying to the OSC for non-monetary federal response 
resources on behalf of all trustees. The lead administrative trustee is 
also responsible for applying to the NPFC for funding for initiation of 
damage assessment for injuries to natural resources.


<R05>
Sec. 300.310  Phase III--Containment, countermeasures, cleanup, and disposal.

    (a) Defensive actions shall begin as soon as possible to prevent, 
minimize, or mitigate threat(s) to the public health or welfare of the 
United States or the environment. Actions may include but are not 
limited to: Analyzing water samples to determine the source and spread 
of the oil; controlling the source of discharge; measuring and sampling; 
source and spread control or salvage operations; placement of physical 
barriers to deter the spread of the oil and to protect natural resources 
and sensitive ecosystems; control of the water discharged from upstream 
impoundment; and the use of chemicals and other materials in accordance 
with subpart J of this part to restrain the spread of the oil and 
mitigate its effects. The ACP prepared under Sec. 300.210(c) should be 
consulted for procedures to be followed for obtaining an expedited 
decision regarding the use of dispersants and other products listed on 
the NCP Product Schedule.
    (b) As appropriate, actions shall be taken to recover the oil or 
mitigate its effects. Of the numerous chemical or physical methods that 
may be used, the chosen methods shall be the most consistent with 
protecting public health and welfare and the environment. Sinking agents 
shall not be used.
    (c) Oil and contaminated materials recovered in cleanup operations 
shall be disposed of in accordance with the RCP, ACP, and any applicable 
laws, regulations, or requirements. RRT and

[[Page 52]]

Area Committee guidelines may identify the disposal options available 
during an oil spill response and may describe what disposal requirements 
are mandatory or may not be waived by the OSC. ACP guidelines should 
address: the sampling, testing, and classifying of recovered oil and 
oiled debris; the segregation, temporary storage, and stockpiling of 
recovered oil and oiled debris; prior state disposal approvals and 
permits; and the routes; methods (e.g. recycle/reuse, on-site burning, 
incineration, landfilling, etc.); and sites for the disposal of 
collected oil, oiled debris, and animal carcasses; and procedures for 
obtaining waivers, exemptions, or authorizations associated with 
handling or transporting waste materials. The ACPs may identify a 
hierarchy of preferences for disposal alternatives, with recycling 
(reprocessing) being the most preferred, and other alternatives 
preferred based on priorities for health or the environment.


<R05>
Sec. 300.315  Phase IV--Documentation and cost recovery.

    (a) All OSLTF users need to collect and maintain documentation to 
support all actions taken under the CWA. In general, documentation shall 
be sufficient to support full cost recovery for resources utilized and 
shall identify the source and circumstances of the incident, the 
responsible party or parties, and impacts and potential impacts to 
public health and welfare and the environment. Documentation procedures 
are contained in 33 CFR part 136.
    (b) When appropriate, documentation shall also be collected for 
scientific understanding of the environment and for research and 
development of improved response methods and technology. Funding for 
these actions is restricted by section 6002 of the OPA.
    (c) OSCs shall submit OSC reports to the NRT or RRT, only if 
requested, as provided by Sec. 300.165.
    (d) OSCs shall ensure the necessary collection and safeguarding of 
information, samples, and reports. Samples and information shall be 
gathered expeditiously during the response to ensure an accurate record 
of the impacts incurred. Documentation materials shall be made available 
to the trustees of affected natural resources. The OSC shall make 
available to trustees of the affected natural resources information and 
documentation in the OSC's possession that can assist the trustees in 
the determination of actual or potential natural resource injuries.
    (e) Information and reports obtained by the EPA or USCG OSC shall be 
transmitted to the appropriate offices responsible for follow-up 
actions.


<R05>
Sec. 300.317  National response priorities.

    (a) Safety of human life must be given the top priority during every 
response action. This includes any search and rescue efforts in the 
general proximity of the discharge and the insurance of safety of 
response personnel.
    (b) Stabilizing the situation to preclude the event from worsening 
is the next priority. All efforts must be focused on saving a vessel 
that has been involved in a grounding, collision, fire, or explosion, so 
that it does not compound the problem. Comparable measures should be 
taken to stabilize a situation involving a facility, pipeline, or other 
source of pollution. Stabilizing the situation includes securing the 
source of the spill and/or removing the remaining oil from the container 
(vessel, tank, or pipeline) to prevent additional oil spillage, to 
reduce the need for follow-up response action, and to minimize adverse 
impact to the environment.
    (c) The response must use all necessary containment and removal 
tactics in a coordinated manner to ensure a timely, effective response 
that minimizes adverse impact to the environment.
    (d) All parts of this national response strategy should be addressed 
concurrently, but safety and stabilization are the highest priorities. 
The OSC should not delay containment and removal decisions unnecessarily 
and should take actions to minimize adverse impact to the environment 
that begins as soon as a discharge occurs, as well as actions to 
minimize further adverse environmental impact from additional 
discharges.
    (e) The priorities set forth in this section are broad in nature, 
and should

[[Page 53]]

not be interpreted to preclude the consideration of other priorities 
that may arise on a site-specific basis.


<R05>
Sec. 300.320  General pattern of response.

    (a) When the OSC receives a report of a discharge, actions normally 
should be taken in the following sequence:
    (1) Investigate the report to determine pertinent information such 
as the threat posed to public health or welfare of the United States or 
the environment, the type and quantity of polluting material, and the 
source of the discharge.
    (2) Officially classify the size (i.e., minor, medium, major) and 
type (i.e., substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the 
United States, worst case discharge) of the discharge and determine the 
course of action to be followed to ensure effective and immediate 
removal, mitigation, or prevention of the discharge. Some discharges 
that are classified as a substantial threat to the public health or 
welfare of the United States may be further classified as a spill of 
national significance by the Administrator of EPA or the Commandant of 
the USCG. The appropriate course of action may be prescribed in 
Secs. 300.322, 300.323, and 300.324.
    (i) When the reported discharge is an actual or potential major 
discharge, the OSC shall immediately notify the RRT and the NRC.
    (ii) When the investigation shows that an actual or potential medium 
discharge exists, the OSC shall recommend activation of the RRT, if 
appropriate.
    (iii) When the investigation shows that an actual or potential minor 
discharge exists, the OSC shall monitor the situation to ensure that 
proper removal action is being taken.
    (3) If the OSC determines that effective and immediate removal, 
mitigation, or prevention of a discharge can be achieved by private 
party efforts, and where the discharge does not pose a substantial 
threat to the public health or welfare of the United States, determine 
whether the responsible party or other person is properly carrying out 
removal. Removal is being done properly when:
    (i) The responsible party is applying the resources called for in 
its response plan to effectively and immediately remove, minimize, or 
mitigate threat(s) to public health and welfare and the environment; and
    (ii) The removal efforts are in accordance with applicable 
regulations, including the NCP. Even if the OSC supplements responsible 
party resources with government resources, the spill response will not 
be considered improper, unless specifically determined by the OSC.
    (4) Where appropriate, determine whether a state or political 
subdivision thereof has the capability to carry out any or all removal 
actions. If so, the OSC may arrange funding to support these actions.
    (5) Ensure prompt notification of the trustees of affected natural 
resources in accordance with the applicable RCP and ACP.
    (b) Removal shall be considered complete when so determined by the 
OSC in consultation with the Governor or Governors of the affected 
states. When the OSC considers removal complete, OSLTF removal funding 
shall end. This determination shall not preclude additional removal 
actions under applicable state law.*COM008*


<R05>
Sec. 300.322  Response to substantial threats to public health or welfare of the United States.

    (a) As part of the investigation described in Sec. 300.320, the OSC 
shall determine whether a discharge results in a substantial threat to 
public health or welfare of the United States (including, but not 
limited to, fish, shellfish, wildlife, other natural resources, and the 
public and private beaches and shorelines of the United States). Factors 
to be considered by the OSC in making this determination include, but 
are not limited to, the size of the discharge, the character of the 
discharge, and the nature of the threat to public health or welfare of 
the United States. Upon obtaining such information, the OSC shall 
conduct an evaluation of the threat posed, based on the OSC's experience 
in assessing other discharges, and consultation with senior lead agency 
officials and readily available authorities on issues outside the OSC's 
technical expertise.

[[Page 54]]

    (b) If the investigation by the OSC shows that the discharge poses 
or may present a substantial threat to public health or welfare of the 
United States, the OSC shall direct all federal, state, or private 
actions to remove the discharge or to mitigate or prevent the threat of 
such a discharge, as appropriate. In directing the response in such 
cases, the OSC may act without regard to any other provision of law 
governing contracting procedures or employment of personnel by the 
federal government to:
    (1) Remove or arrange for the removal of the discharge;
    (2) Mitigate or prevent the substantial threat of the discharge; and
    (3) Remove and, if necessary, destroy a vessel discharging, or 
threatening to discharge, by whatever means are available.
    (c) In the case of a substantial threat to public health or welfare 
of the United States, the OSC shall:
    (1) Assess opportunities for the use of various special teams and 
other assistance described in Sec. 300.145, including the use of the 
services of the NSFCC, as appropriate;
    (2) Request immediate activation of the RRT; and
    (3) Take whatever additional response actions are deemed 
appropriate, including, but not limited to, implementation of the ACP as 
required by section 311(j)(4) of the CWA or relevant tank vessel or 
facility response plan required by section 311(j)(5) of the CWA. When 
requested by the OSC, the lead agency or RRT shall dispatch appropriate 
personnel to the scene of the discharge to assist the OSC. This 
assistance may include technical support in the agency's areas of 
expertise and disseminating information to the public. The lead agency 
shall ensure that a contracting officer is available on scene, at the 
request of the OSC.


<R05>
Sec. 300.323  Spills of national significance

    (a) A discharge may be classified as a spill of national 
significance (SONS) by the Administrator of EPA for discharges occurring 
in the inland zone and the Commandant of the USCG for discharges 
occurring in the coastal zone.
    (b) For a SONS in the inland zone, the EPA Administrator may name a 
senior Agency official to assist the OSC in communicating with affected 
parties and the public and coordinating federal, state, local, and 
international resources at the national level. This strategic 
coordination will involve, as appropriate, the NRT, RRT(s), the 
Governor(s) of affected state(s), and the mayor(s) or other chief 
executive(s) of local government(s).
    (c) For a SONS in the coastal zone, the USCG Commandant may name a 
National Incident Commander (NIC) who will assume the role of the OSC in 
communicating with affected parties and the public, and coordinating 
federal, state, local, and international resources at the national 
level. This strategic coordination will involve, as appropriate, the 
NRT, RRT(s), the Governor(s) of affected state(s), and the mayor(s) or 
other chief executive(s) of local government(s).


<R05>
Sec. 300.324  Response to worst case discharges.

    (a) If the investigation by the OSC shows that a discharge is a 
worst case discharge as defined in the ACP, or there is a substantial 
threat of such a discharge, the OSC shall:
    (1) Notify the NSFCC;
    (2) Require, where applicable, implementation of the worst case 
portion of an approved tank vessel or facility response plan required by 
section 311(j)(5) of the CWA;
    (3) Implement the worst case portion of the ACP required by section 
311(j)(4) of the CWA; and
    (4) Take whatever additional response actions are deemed 
appropriate.
    (b) Under the direction of the OSC, the NSFCC shall coordinate use 
of private and public personnel and equipment, including strike teams, 
to remove a worst case discharge and mitigate or prevent a substantial 
threat of such a discharge.


<R05>
Sec. 300.335  Funding.

    (a) The OSLTF is available under certain circumstances to fund 
removal of oil performed under section 311 of the CWA. Those 
circumstances and the procedures for accessing the OSLTF are described 
in 33 CFR part 136. The

[[Page 55]]

responsible party is liable for costs of federal removal and damages in 
accordance with section 311(f) of the CWA, section 1002 of the OPA, and 
other federal laws.
    (b) Where the OSC requests assistance from a federal agency, that 
agency may be reimbursed in accordance with the provisions of 33 CFR 
part 136. Specific interagency reimbursement agreements may be used when 
necessary to ensure that the federal resources will be available for a 
timely response to a discharge of oil.
    (c) Procedures for funding the initiation of natural resource damage 
assessment are covered in 33 CFR part 136.
    (d) Response actions other than removal, such as scientific 
investigations not in support of removal actions or law enforcement, 
shall be provided by the agency with legal responsibility for those 
specific actions.
    (e) The funding of a response to a discharge from a federally owned, 
operated, or supervised facility or vessel is the responsibility of the 
owning, operating, or supervising agency if it is a responsible party.
    (f) The following agencies have funds available for certain 
discharge removal actions:
    (1) DOD has two specific sources of funds that may be applicable to 
an oil discharge under appropriate circumstances. This does not consider 
military resources that might be made available under specific 
conditions.
    (i) Funds required for removal of a sunken vessel or similar 
obstruction of navigation are available to the Corps of Engineers 
through Civil Works Appropriations, Operations and Maintenance, General.
    (ii) USN may conduct salvage operations contingent on defense 
operational commitments, when funded by the requesting agency. Such 
funding may be requested on a direct cite basis.
    (2) Pursuant to Title I of the OPA, the state or states affected by 
a discharge of oil may act where necessary to remove such discharge. 
Pursuant to 33 CFR part 136 states may be reimbursed from the OSLTF for 
the reasonable costs incurred in such a removal.

                 Subpart E--Hazardous Substance Response

    Source: 55 FR 8839, Mar. 8, 1990, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 300.400  General.

    (a) This subpart establishes methods and criteria for determining 
the appropriate extent of response authorized by CERCLA and CWA section 
311(c):
    (1) When there is a release of a hazardous substance into the 
environment; or
    (2) When there is a release into the environment of any pollutant or 
contaminant that may present an imminent and substantial danger to the 
public health or welfare of the United States.
    (b) Limitations on response. Unless the lead agency determines that 
a release constitutes a public health or environmental emergency and no 
other person with the authority and capability to respond will do so in 
a timely manner, a removal or remedial action under section 104 of 
CERCLA shall not be undertaken in response to a release:
    (1) Of a naturally occurring substance in its unaltered form, or 
altered solely through naturally occurring processes or phenomena, from 
a location where it is naturally found;
    (2) From products that are part of the structure of, and result in 
exposure within, residential buildings or business or community 
structures; or
    (3) Into public or private drinking water supplies due to 
deterioration of the system through ordinary use.
    (c) Fund-financed action. In determining the need for and in 
planning or undertaking Fund-financed action, the lead agency shall, to 
the extent practicable:
    (1) Engage in prompt response;
    (2) Provide for state participation in response actions, as 
described in subpart F of this part;
    (3) Conserve Fund monies by encouraging private party response;
    (4) Be sensitive to local community concerns;
    (5) Consider using treatment technologies;

[[Page 56]]

    (6) Involve the Regional Response Team (RRT) in both removal and 
remedial response actions at appropriate decision-making stages;
    (7) Encourage the involvement and sharing of technology by industry 
and other experts; and
    (8) Encourage the involvement of organizations to coordinate 
responsible party actions, foster site response, and provide technical 
advice to the public, federal and state governments, and industry.
    (d) Entry and access. (1) For purposes of determining the need for 
response, or choosing or taking a response action, or otherwise 
enforcing the provisions of CERCLA, EPA, or the appropriate federal 
agency, and a state or political subdivision operating pursuant to a 
contract or cooperative agreement under CERCLA section 104(d)(1), has 
the authority to enter any vessel, facility, establishment or other 
place, property, or location described in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section and conduct, complete, operate, and maintain any response 
actions authorized by CERCLA or these regulations.
    (2)(i) Under the authorities described in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, EPA, or the appropriate federal agency, and a state or 
political subdivision operating pursuant to a contract or cooperative 
agreement under CERCLA section 104(d)(1), may enter:
    (A) Any vessel, facility, establishment, or other place or property 
where any hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant may be or has 
been generated, stored, treated, disposed of, or transported from;
    (B) Any vessel, facility, establishment, or other place or property 
from which, or to which, a hazardous substance or pollutant or 
contaminant has been, or may have been, released or where such release 
is or may be threatened;
    (C) Any vessel, facility, establishment, or other place or property 
where entry is necessary to determine the need for response or the 
appropriate response or to effectuate a response action; or
    (D) Any vessel, facility, establishment, or other place, property, 
or location adjacent to those vessels, facilities, establishments, 
places, or properties described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A), (B), or (C) 
of this section.
    (ii) Once a determination has been made that there is a reasonable 
basis to believe that there has been or may be a release, EPA, or the 
appropriate federal agency, and a state or political subdivision 
operating pursuant to a contract or cooperative agreement under CERCLA 
section 104(d)(1), is authorized to enter all vessels, facilities, 
establishments, places, properties, or locations specified in paragraph 
(d)(2)(i) of this section, at which the release is believed to be, and 
all other vessels, facilities, establishments, places, properties, or 
locations identified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section that are 
related to the response or are necessary to enter in responding to that 
release.
    (3) The lead agency may designate as its representative solely for 
the purpose of access, among others, one or more potentially responsible 
parties, including representatives, employees, agents, and contractors 
of such parties. EPA, or the appropriate federal agency, may exercise 
the authority contained in section 104(e) of CERCLA to obtain access for 
its designated representative. A potentially responsible party may only 
be designated as a representative of the lead agency where that 
potentially responsible party has agreed to conduct response activities 
pursuant to an administrative order or consent decree.
    (4)(i) If consent is not granted under the authorities described in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, or if consent is conditioned in any 
manner, EPA, or the appropriate federal agency, may issue an order 
pursuant to section 104(e)(5) of CERCLA directing compliance with the 
request for access made under Sec. 300.400(d)(1). EPA or the appropriate 
federal agency may ask the Attorney General to commence a civil action 
to compel compliance with either a request for access or an order 
directing compliance.
    (ii) EPA reserves the right to proceed, where appropriate, under 
applicable authority other than CERCLA section 104(e).
    (iii) The administrative order may direct compliance with a request 
to

[[Page 57]]

enter or inspect any vessel, facility, establishment, place, property, 
or location described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (iv) Each order shall contain:
    (A) A determination by EPA, or the appropriate federal agency, that 
it is reasonable to believe that there may be or has been a release or 
threat of a release of a hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant 
and a statement of the facts upon which the determination is based;
    (B) A description, in light of CERCLA response authorities, of the 
purpose and estimated scope and duration of the entry, including a 
description of the specific anticipated activities to be conducted 
pursuant to the order;
    (C) A provision advising the person who failed to consent that an 
officer or employee of the agency that issued the order will be 
available to confer with respondent prior to effective date of the 
order; and
    (D) A provision advising the person who failed to consent that a 
court may impose a penalty of up to $25,000 per day for unreasonable 
failure to comply with the order.
    (v) Orders shall be served upon the person or responsible party who 
failed to consent prior to their effective date. Force shall not be used 
to compel compliance with an order.
    (vi) Orders may not be issued for any criminal investigations.
    (e) Permit requirements. (1) No federal, state, or local permits are 
required for on-site response actions conducted pursuant to CERCLA 
sections 104, 106, 120, 121, or 122. The term on-site means the areal 
extent of contamination and all suitable areas in very close proximity 
to the contamination necessary for implementation of the response 
action.
    (2) Permits, if required, shall be obtained for all response 
activities conducted off-site.
    (f) Health assessments. Health assessments shall be performed by 
ATSDR at facilities on or proposed to be listed on the NPL and may be 
performed at other releases or facilities in response to petitions made 
to ATSDR. Where available, these health assessments may be used by the 
lead agency to assist in determining whether response actions should be 
taken and/or to identify the need for additional studies to assist in 
the assessment of potential human health effects associated with 
releases or potential releases of hazardous substances.
    (g) Identification of applicable or relevant and appropriate 
requirements. (1) The lead and support agencies shall identify 
requirements applicable to the release or remedial action contemplated 
based upon an objective determination of whether the requirement 
specifically addresses a hazardous substance, pollutant, contaminant, 
remedial action, location, or other circumstance found at a CERCLA site.
    (2) If, based upon paragraph (g)(1) of this section, it is 
determined that a requirement is not applicable to a specific release, 
the requirement may still be relevant and appropriate to the 
circumstances of the release. In evaluating relevance and 
appropriateness, the factors in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (viii) of 
this section shall be examined, where pertinent, to determine whether a 
requirement addresses problems or situations sufficiently similar to the 
circumstances of the release or remedial action contemplated, and 
whether the requirement is well-suited to the site, and therefore is 
both relevant and appropriate. The pertinence of each of the following 
factors will depend, in part, on whether a requirement addresses a 
chemical, location, or action. The following comparisons shall be made, 
where pertinent, to determine relevance and appropriateness:
    (i) The purpose of the requirement and the purpose of the CERCLA 
action;
    (ii) The medium regulated or affected by the requirement and the 
medium contaminated or affected at the CERCLA site;
    (iii) The substances regulated by the requirement and the substances 
found at the CERCLA site;
    (iv) The actions or activities regulated by the requirement and the 
remedial action contemplated at the CERCLA site;
    (v) Any variances, waivers, or exemptions of the requirement and 
their availability for the circumstances at the CERCLA site;
    (vi) The type of place regulated and the type of place affected by 
the release or CERCLA action;

[[Page 58]]

    (vii) The type and size of structure or facility regulated and the 
type and size of structure or facility affected by the release or 
contemplated by the CERCLA action;
    (viii) Any consideration of use or potential use of affected 
resources in the requirement and the use or potential use of the 
affected resource at the CERCLA site.
    (3) In addition to applicable or relevant and appropriate 
requirements, the lead and support agencies may, as appropriate, 
identify other advisories, criteria, or guidance to be considered for a 
particular release. The ``to be considered'' (TBC) category consists of 
advisories, criteria, or guidance that were developed by EPA, other 
federal agencies, or states that may be useful in developing CERCLA 
remedies.
    (4) Only those state standards that are promulgated, are identified 
by the state in a timely manner, and are more stringent than federal 
requirements may be applicable or relevant and appropriate. For purposes 
of identification and notification of promulgated state standards, the 
term promulgated means that the standards are of general applicability 
and are legally enforceable.
    (5) The lead agency and support agency shall identify their specific 
requirements that are applicable or relevant and appropriate for a 
particular site. These agencies shall notify each other, in a timely 
manner as described in Sec. 300.515(d), of the requirements they have 
determined to be applicable or relevant and appropriate. When 
identifying a requirement as an ARAR, the lead agency and support agency 
shall include a citation to the statute or regulation from which the 
requirement is derived.
    (6) Notification of ARARs shall be according to procedures and 
timeframes specified in Sec. 300.515 (d)(2) and (h)(2).
    (h) Oversight. The lead agency may provide oversight for actions 
taken by potentially responsible parties to ensure that a response is 
conducted consistent with this part. The lead agency may also monitor 
the actions of third parties preauthorized under subpart H of this part. 
EPA will provide oversight when the response is pursuant to an EPA order 
or federal consent decree.
    (i) Other. (1) This subpart does not establish any preconditions to 
enforcement action by either the federal or state governments to compel 
response actions by potentially responsible parties.
    (2) While much of this subpart is oriented toward federally funded 
response actions, this subpart may be used as guidance concerning 
methods and criteria for response actions by other parties under other 
funding mechanisms. Except as provided in subpart H of this part, 
nothing in this part is intended to limit the rights of any person to 
seek recovery of response costs from responsible parties pursuant to 
CERCLA section 107.
    (3) Activities by the federal and state governments in implementing 
this subpart are discretionary governmental functions. This subpart does 
not create in any private party a right to federal response or 
enforcement action. This subpart does not create any duty of the federal 
government to take any response action at any particular time.

<R05>
Sec. 300.405  Discovery or notification.

    (a) A release may be discovered through:
    (1) A report submitted in accordance with section 103(a) of CERCLA, 
i.e., reportable quantities codified at 40 CFR part 302;
    (2) A report submitted to EPA in accordance with section 103(c) of 
CERCLA;
    (3) Investigation by government authorities conducted in accordance 
with section 104(e) of CERCLA or other statutory authority;
    (4) Notification of a release by a federal or state permit holder 
when required by its permit;
    (5) Inventory or survey efforts or random or incidental observation 
reported by government agencies or the public;
    (6) Submission of a citizen petition to EPA or the appropriate 
federal facility requesting a preliminary assessment, in accordance with 
section 105(d) of CERCLA;
    (7) A report submitted in accordance with section 311(b)(5) of the 
CWA; and
    (8) Other sources.

[[Page 59]]

    (b) Any person in charge of a vessel or a facility shall report 
releases as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to the 
National Response Center (NRC). If direct reporting to the NRC is not 
practicable, reports may be made to the United States Coast Guard (USCG) 
on-scene coordinator (OSC) for the geographic area where the release 
occurs. The EPA predesignated OSC may also be contacted through the 
regional 24-hour emergency response telephone number. All such reports 
shall be promptly relayed to the NRC. If it is not possible to notify 
the NRC or predesignated OSC immediately, reports may be made 
immediately to the nearest USCG unit. In any event, such person in 
charge of the vessel or facility shall notify the NRC as soon as 
possible.
    (c) All other reports of releases described under paragraph (a) of 
this section, except releases reported under paragraphs (a)(2) and (6) 
of this section, shall, as appropriate, be made to the NRC.
    (d) The NRC will generally need information that will help to 
characterize the release. This will include, but not be limited to: 
Location of the release; type(s) of material(s) released; an estimate of 
the quantity of material released; possible source of the release; and 
date and time of the release. Reporting under paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section shall not be delayed due to incomplete notification 
information.
    (e) Upon receipt of a notification of a release, the NRC shall 
promptly notify the appropriate OSC. The OSC shall notify the Governor, 
or designee, of the state affected by the release.
    (f)(1) When the OSC is notified of a release that may require 
response pursuant to Sec. 300.415(b), a removal site evaluation shall, 
as appropriate, be promptly undertaken pursuant to Sec. 300.410.
    (2) When notification indicates that removal action pursuant to 
Sec. 300.415(b) is not required, a remedial site evaluation shall, if 
appropriate, be undertaken by the lead agency pursuant to Sec. 300.420, 
if one has not already been performed.
    (3) If radioactive substances are present in a release, the EPA 
Radiological Response Coordinator should be notified for evaluation and 
assistance either directly or via the NRC, consistent with 
Secs. 300.130(e) and 300.145(f).
    (g) Release notification made to the NRC under this section does not 
relieve the owner/operator of a facility from any obligations to which 
it is subject under SARA Title III or state law. In particular, it does 
not relieve the owner/operator from the requirements of section 304 of 
SARA Title III and 40 CFR part 355 and Sec. 300.215(f) of this part for 
notifying the community emergency coordinator for the appropriate local 
emergency planning committee of all affected areas and the state 
emergency response commission of any state affected that there has been 
a release. Federal agencies are not legally obligated to comply with the 
requirements of Title III of SARA.

<R05>
Sec. 300.410  Removal site evaluation.

    (a) A removal site evaluation includes a removal preliminary 
assessment and, if warranted, a removal site inspection.
    (b) A removal site evaluation of a release identified for possible 
CERCLA response pursuant to Sec. 300.415 shall, as appropriate, be 
undertaken by the lead agency as promptly as possible. The lead agency 
may perform a removal preliminary assessment in response to petitions 
submitted by a person who is, or may be, affected by a release of a 
hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant pursuant to 
Sec. 300.420(b)(5).
    (c)(1) The lead agency shall, as appropriate, base the removal 
preliminary assessment on readily available information. A removal 
preliminary assessment may include, but is not limited to:
    (i) Identification of the source and nature of the release or threat 
of release;
    (ii) Evaluation by ATSDR or by other sources, for example, state 
public health agencies, of the threat to public health;
    (iii) Evaluation of the magnitude of the threat;
    (iv) Evaluation of factors necessary to make the determination of 
whether a removal is necessary; and

[[Page 60]]

    (v) Determination of whether a nonfederal party is undertaking 
proper response.
    (2) A removal preliminary assessment of releases from hazardous 
waste management facilities may include collection or review of data 
such as site management practices, information from generators, 
photographs, analysis of historical photographs, literature searches, 
and personal interviews conducted, as appropriate.
    (d) A removal site inspection may be performed if more information 
is needed. Such inspection may include a perimeter (i.e., off-site) or 
on-site inspection, taking into consideration whether such inspection 
can be performed safely.
    (e)(1) As part of the evaluation under this section, the OSC shall 
determine whether a release governed by CWA section 311(c)(1), as 
amended by OPA section 4201(a), has occurred.
    (2) If such a release of a CWA hazardous substance has occurred, the 
OSC shall determine whether the release results in a substantial threat 
to the public health or welfare of the United States. Factors to be 
considered by the OSC in making this determination include, but are not 
limited to, the size of the release, the character of the release, and 
the nature of the threat to public health or welfare of the United 
States. Upon obtaining relevant elements of such information, the OSC 
shall conduct an evaluation of the threat posed, based on the OSC's 
experience in assessing other releases, and consultation with senior 
lead agency officials and readily available authorities on issues 
outside the OSC's technical expertise.
    (f) A removal site evaluation shall be terminated when the OSC or 
lead agency determines:
    (1) There is no release;
    (2) The source is neither a vessel nor a facility as defined in 
Sec. 300.5 of the NCP;
    (3) The release involves neither a hazardous substance, nor a 
pollutant or contaminant that may present an imminent and substantial 
danger to public health or welfare of the United States;
    (4) The release consists of a situation specified in 
Sec. 300.400(b)(1) through (3) subject to limitations on response;
    (5) The amount, quantity, or concentration released does not warrant 
federal response;
    (6) A party responsible for the release, or any other person, is 
providing appropriate response, and on-scene monitoring by the 
government is not required; or
    (7) The removal site evaluation is completed.
    (g) The results of the removal site evaluation shall be documented.
    (h) The OSC or lead agency shall ensure that natural resource 
trustees are promptly notified in order that they may initiate 
appropriate actions, including those identified in Subpart G of this 
part. The OSC or lead agency shall coordinate all response activities 
with such affected trustees.
    (i) If the removal site evaluation indicates that removal action 
under Sec. 300.415 is not required, but that remedial action under 
Sec. 300.430 may be necessary, the lead agency shall, as appropriate, 
initiate a remedial site evaluation pursuant to Sec. 300.420.

<R05>
Sec. 300.415  Removal action.

    (a)(1) In determining the appropriate extent of action to be taken 
in response to a given release, the lead agency shall first review the 
removal site evaluation, any information produced through a remedial 
site evaluation, if any has been done previously, and the current site 
conditions, to determine if removal action is appropriate.
    (2) Where the responsible parties are known, an effort initially 
shall be made, to the extent practicable, to determine whether they can 
and will perform the necessary removal action promptly and properly.
    (3) This section does not apply to removal actions taken pursuant to 
section 104(b) of CERCLA. The criteria for such actions are set forth in 
section 104(b) of CERCLA.
    (b)(1) At any release, regardless of whether the site is included on 
the National Priorities List (NPL), where the lead agency makes the 
determination, based on the factors in paragraph (b)(2)

[[Page 61]]

of this section, that there is a threat to public health or welfare of 
the United States or the environment, the lead agency may take any 
appropriate removal action to abate, prevent, minimize, stabilize, 
mitigate, or eliminate the release or the threat of release.
    (2) The following factors shall be considered in determining the 
appropriateness of a removal action pursuant to this section:
    (i) Actual or potential exposure to nearby human populations, 
animals, or the food chain from hazardous substances or pollutants or 
contaminants;
    (ii) Actual or potential contamination of drinking water supplies or 
sensitive ecosystems;
    (iii) Hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants in drums, 
barrels, tanks, or other bulk storage containers, that may pose a threat 
of release;
    (iv) High levels of hazardous substances or pollutants or 
contaminants in soils largely at or near the surface, that may migrate;
    (v) Weather conditions that may cause hazardous substances or 
pollutants or contaminants to migrate or be released;
    (vi) Threat of fire or explosion;
    (vii) The availability of other appropriate federal or state 
response mechanisms to respond to the release; and
    (viii) Other situations or factors that may pose threats to public 
health or welfare of the United States or the environment.
    (3) If the lead agency determines that a removal action is 
appropriate, actions shall, as appropriate, begin as soon as possible to 
abate, prevent, minimize, stabilize, mitigate, or eliminate the threat 
to public health or welfare of the United States or the environment. The 
lead agency shall, at the earliest possible time, also make any 
necessary determinations pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (4) Whenever a planning period of at least six months exists before 
on-site activities must be initiated, and the lead agency determines, 
based on a site evaluation, that a removal action is appropriate:
    (i) The lead agency shall conduct an engineering evaluation/cost 
analysis (EE/CA) or its equivalent. The EE/CA is an analysis of removal 
alternatives for a site.
    (ii) If environmental samples are to be collected, the lead agency 
shall develop sampling and analysis plans that shall provide a process 
for obtaining data of sufficient quality and quantity to satisfy data 
needs. Sampling and analysis plans shall be reviewed and approved by 
EPA. The sampling and analysis plans shall consist of two parts:
    (A) The field sampling plan, which describes the number, type, and 
location of samples and the type of analyses; and
    (B) The quality assurance project plan, which describes policy, 
organization, and functional activities and the data quality objectives 
and measures necessary to achieve adequate data for use in planning and 
documenting the removal action.
    (5) CERCLA fund-financed removal actions, other than those 
authorized under section 104(b) of CERCLA, shall be terminated after $2 
million has been obligated for the action or 12 months have elapsed from 
the date that removal activities begin on-site, unless the lead agency 
determines that:
    (i) There is an immediate risk to public health or welfare of the 
United States or the environment; continued response actions are 
immediately required to prevent, limit, or mitigate an emergency; and 
such assistance will not otherwise be provided on a timely basis; or
    (ii) Continued response action is otherwise appropriate and 
consistent with the remedial action to be taken.
    (c)(1) In carrying out a response to a release of a CWA hazardous 
substance, as described in CWA section 311(c)(1), as amended by OPA 
section 4201(a), the OSC may:
    (i) Remove or arrange for the removal of a release, and mitigate or 
prevent a substantial threat of a release, at any time;
    (ii) Direct or monitor all federal, state, and private actions to 
remove a release; and
    (iii) Remove and, if necessary, destroy a vessel releasing or 
threatening to release CWA hazardous substances, by whatever means are 
available.

[[Page 62]]

    (2) If the investigation by the OSC under Sec. 300.410 shows that 
the release of a CWA hazardous substance results in a substantial threat 
to public health or welfare of the United States, the OSC shall direct 
all federal, state, or private actions to remove the release or to 
mitigate or prevent the threat of such a release, as appropriate. In 
directing the response, the OSC may act without regard to any other 
provision of law governing contracting procedures or employment of 
personnel by the federal government to:
    (i) Remove or arrange for the removal of the release;
    (ii) Mitigate or prevent the substantial threat of the release; and
    (iii) Remove and, if necessary, destroy a vessel releasing, or 
threatening to release, by whatever means are available.
    (3) In the case of a release of a CWA hazardous substance posing a 
substantial threat to public health or welfare of the United States, the 
OSC shall:
    (i) Assess opportunities for the use of various special teams and 
other assistance described in Sec. 300.145, as appropriate;
    (ii) Request immediate activation of the RRT; and
    (iii) Take whatever additional response actions are deemed 
appropriate. When requested by the OSC, the lead agency or RRT shall 
dispatch appropriate personnel to the scene of the release to assist the 
OSC. This assistance may include technical support in the agency's areas 
of expertise and disseminating information to the public in accordance 
with Sec. 300.155. The lead agency shall ensure that a contracting 
officer is available on-scene, at the request of the OSC.
    (d) Removal actions shall, to the extent practicable, contribute to 
the efficient performance of any anticipated long-term remedial action 
with respect to the release concerned.
    (e) The following removal actions are, as a general rule, 
appropriate in the types of situations shown; however, this list is not 
exhaustive and is not intended to prevent the lead agency from taking 
any other actions deemed necessary under CERCLA, CWA section 311, or 
other appropriate federal or state enforcement or response authorities, 
and the list does not create a duty on the lead agency to take action at 
any particular time:
    (1) Fences, warning signs, or other security or site control 
precautions--where humans or animals have access to the release;
    (2) Drainage controls, for example, run-off or run-on diversion--
where needed to reduce migration of hazardous substances or pollutants 
or contaminants off-site or to prevent precipitation or run-off from 
other sources, for example, flooding, from entering the release area 
from other areas;
    (3) Stabilization of berms, dikes, or impoundments or drainage or 
closing of lagoons--where needed to maintain the integrity of the 
structures;
    (4) Capping of contaminated soils or sludges--where needed to reduce 
migration of hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants into 
soil, ground or surface water, or air;
    (5) Using chemicals and other materials to retard the spread of the 
release or to mitigate its effects--where the use of such chemicals will 
reduce the spread of the release;
    (6) Excavation, consolidation, or removal of highly contaminated 
soils from drainage or other areas--where such actions will reduce the 
spread of, or direct contact with, the contamination;
    (7) Removal of drums, barrels, tanks, or other bulk containers that 
contain or may contain hazardous substances or pollutants or 
contaminants--where it will reduce the likelihood of spillage; leakage; 
exposure to humans, animals, or food chain; or fire or explosion;
    (8) Containment, treatment, disposal, or incineration of hazardous 
materials--where needed to reduce the likelihood of human, animal, or 
food chain exposure; or
    (9) Provision of alternative water supply--where necessary 
immediately to reduce exposure to contaminated household water and 
continuing until such time as local authorities can satisfy the need for 
a permanent remedy.
    (f) Where necessary to protect public health or welfare, the lead 
agency shall request that FEMA conduct a temporary relocation or that 
state/local officials conduct an evacuation.

[[Page 63]]

    (g) If the lead agency determines that the removal action will not 
fully address the threat posed by the release and the release may 
require remedial action, the lead agency shall ensure an orderly 
transition from removal to remedial response activities.
    (h) CERCLA removal actions conducted by states under cooperative 
agreements, described in subpart F of this part, shall comply with all 
requirements of this section.
    (i) Facilities operated by a state or political subdivision at the 
time of disposal require a state cost share of at least 50 percent of 
Fund-financed response costs if a Fund-financed remedial action is 
conducted.
    (j) Fund-financed removal actions under CERCLA section 104 and 
removal actions pursuant to CERCLA section 106 shall, to the extent 
practicable considering the exigencies of the situation, attain 
applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements (ARARs) under 
federal environmental or state environmental or facility siting laws. 
Waivers described in Sec. 300.430(f)(1)(ii)(C) may be used for removal 
actions. Other federal and state advisories, criteria, or guidance may, 
as appropriate, be considered in formulating the removal action (see 
Sec. 300.400(g)(3)). In determining whether compliance with ARARs is 
practicable, the lead agency may consider appropriate factors, 
including:
    (1) The urgency of the situation; and
    (2) The scope of the removal action to be conducted.
    (k) Removal actions pursuant to section 106 or 122 of CERCLA are not 
subject to the following requirements of this section:
    (1) Section 300.415(a)(2) requirement to locate responsible parties 
and have them undertake the response;
    (2) Section 300.415(b)(2)(vii) requirement to consider the 
availability of other appropriate federal or state response and 
enforcement mechanisms to respond to the release;
    (3) Section 300.415(b)(5) requirement to terminate response after $2 
million has been obligated or 12 months have elapsed from the date of 
the initial response; and
    (4) Section 300.415(g) requirement to assure an orderly transition 
from removal to remedial action.
    (l) To the extent practicable, provision for post-removal site 
control following a CERCLA Fund-financed removal action at both NPL and 
non-NPL sites is encouraged to be made prior to the initiation of the 
removal action. Such post-removal site control includes actions 
necessary to ensure the effectiveness and integrity of the removal 
action after the completion of the on-site removal action or after the 
$2 million or 12-month statutory limits are reached for sites that do 
not meet the exemption criteria in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. 
Post-removal site control may be conducted by:
    (1) The affected state or political subdivision thereof or local 
units of government for any removal;
    (2) Potentially responsible parties; or
    (3) EPA's remedial program for some federal-lead Fund-financed 
responses at NPL sites.
    (m) OSCs/RPMs conducting removal actions shall submit OSC reports to 
the RRT as required by Sec. 300.165.
    (n) Community relations in removal actions. (1) In the case of all 
CERCLA removal actions taken pursuant to Sec. 300.415 or CERCLA 
enforcement actions to compel removal response, a spokesperson shall be 
designated by the lead agency. The spokesperson shall inform the 
community of actions taken, respond to inquiries, and provide 
information concerning the release. All news releases or statements made 
by participating agencies shall be coordinated with the OSC/RPM. The 
spokesperson shall notify, at a minimum, immediately affected citizens, 
state and local officials, and, when appropriate, civil defense or 
emergency management agencies.
    (2) For CERCLA actions where, based on the site evaluation, the lead 
agency determines that a removal is appropriate, and that less than six 
months exists before on-site removal activity must begin, the lead 
agency shall:
    (i) Publish a notice of availability of the administrative record 
file established pursuant to Sec. 300.820 in a major local newspaper of 
general circulation within 60 days of initiation of on-site removal 
activity;
    (ii) Provide a public comment period, as appropriate, of not less 
than 30 days from the time the administrative

[[Page 64]]

record file is made available for public inspection, pursuant to 
Sec. 300.820(b)(2); and
    (iii) Prepare a written response to significant comments pursuant to 
Sec. 300.820(b)(3).
    (3) For CERCLA removal actions where on-site action is expected to 
extend beyond 120 days from the initiation of on-site removal 
activities, the lead agency shall by the end of the 120-day period:
    (i) Conduct interviews with local officials, community residents, 
public interest groups, or other interested or affected parties, as 
appropriate, to solicit their concerns, information needs, and how or 
when citizens would like to be involved in the Superfund process;
    (ii) Prepare a formal community relations plan (CRP) based on the 
community interviews and other relevant information, specifying the 
community relations activities that the lead agency expects to undertake 
during the response; and
    (iii) Establish at least one local information repository at or near 
the location of the response action. The information repository should 
contain items made available for public information. Further, an 
administrative record file established pursuant to subpart I for all 
removal actions shall be available for public inspection in at least one 
of the repositories. The lead agency shall inform the public of the 
establishment of the information repository and provide notice of 
availability of the administrative record file for public review. All 
items in the repository shall be available for public inspection and 
copying.
    (4) Where, based on the site evaluation, the lead agency determines 
that a CERCLA removal action is appropriate and that a planning period 
of at least six months exists prior to initiation of the on-site removal 
activities, the lead agency shall at a minimum:
    (i) Comply with the requirements set forth in paragraphs (n)(3)(i), 
(ii), and (iii) of this section, prior to the completion of the EE/CA, 
or its equivalent, except that the information repository and the 
administrative record file will be established no later than when the 
EE/CA approval memorandum is signed;
    (ii) Publish a notice of availability and brief description of the 
EE/CA in a major local newspaper of general circulation pursuant to 
Sec. 300.820;
    (iii) Provide a reasonable opportunity, not less than 30 calendar 
days, for submission of written and oral comments after completion of 
the EE/CA pursuant to Sec. 300.820(a). Upon timely request, the lead 
agency will extend the public comment period by a minimum of 15 days; 
and
    (iv) Prepare a written response to significant comments pursuant to 
Sec. 300.820(a).

<R05>
Sec. 300.420  Remedial site evaluation.

    (a) General. The purpose of this section is to describe the methods, 
procedures, and criteria the lead agency shall use to collect data, as 
required, and evaluate releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or 
contaminants. The evaluation may consist of two steps: a remedial 
preliminary assessment (PA) and a remedial site inspection (SI).
    (b) Remedial preliminary assessment. (1) The lead agency shall 
perform a remedial PA on all sites in CERCLIS as defined in Sec. 300.5 
to:
    (i) Eliminate from further consideration those sites that pose no 
threat to public health or the environment;
    (ii) Determine if there is any potential need for removal action;
    (iii) Set priorities for site inspections; and
    (iv) Gather existing data to facilitate later evaluation of the 
release pursuant to the Hazard Ranking System (HRS) if warranted.
    (2) A remedial PA shall consist of a review of existing information 
about a release such as information on the pathways of exposure, 
exposure targets, and source and nature of release. A remedial PA shall 
also include an off-site reconnaissance as appropriate. A remedial PA 
may include an on-site reconnaissance where appropriate.
    (3) If the remedial PA indicates that a removal action may be 
warranted, the lead agency shall initiate removal evaluation pursuant to 
Sec. 300.410.
    (4) In performing a remedial PA, the lead agency may complete the 
EPA

[[Page 65]]

Preliminary Assessment form, available from EPA regional offices, or its 
equivalent, and shall prepare a PA report, which shall include:
    (i) A description of the release;
    (ii) A description of the probable nature of the release; and
    (iii) A recommendation on whether further action is warranted, which 
lead agency should conduct further action, and whether an SI or removal 
action or both should be undertaken.
    (5) Any person may petition the lead federal agency (EPA or the 
appropriate federal agency in the case of a release or suspected release 
from a federal facility), to perform a PA of a release when such person 
is, or may be, affected by a release of a hazardous substance, 
pollutant, or contaminant. Such petitions shall be addressed to the EPA 
Regional Administrator for the region in which the release is located, 
except that petitions for PAs involving federal facilities should be 
addressed to the head of the appropriate federal agency.
    (i) Petitions shall be signed by the petitioner and shall contain 
the following:
    (A) The full name, address, and phone number of petitioner;
    (B) A description, as precisely as possible, of the location of the 
release; and
    (C) How the petitioner is or may be affected by the release.
    (ii) Petitions should also contain the following information to the 
extent available:
    (A) What type of substances were or may be released;
    (B) The nature of activities that have occurred where the release is 
located; and
    (C) Whether local and state authorities have been contacted about 
the release.
    (iii) The lead federal agency shall complete a remedial or removal 
PA within one year of the date of receipt of a complete petition 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section, if one has not been 
performed previously, unless the lead federal agency determines that a 
PA is not appropriate. Where such a determination is made, the lead 
federal agency shall notify the petitioner and will provide a reason for 
the determination.
    (iv) When determining if performance of a PA is appropriate, the 
lead federal agency shall take into consideration:
    (A) Whether there is information indicating that a release has 
occurred or there is a threat of a release of a hazardous substance, 
pollutant, or contaminant; and
    (B) Whether the release is eligible for response under CERCLA.
    (c) Remedial site inspection. (1) The lead agency shall perform a 
remedial SI as appropriate to:
    (i) Eliminate from further consideration those releases that pose no 
significant threat to public health or the environment;
    (ii) Determine the potential need for removal action;
    (iii) Collect or develop additional data, as appropriate, to 
evaluate the release pursuant to the HRS; and
    (iv) Collect data in addition to that required to score the release 
pursuant to the HRS, as appropriate, to better characterize the release 
for more effective and rapid initiation of the RI/FS or response under 
other authorities.
    (2) The remedial SI shall build upon the information collected in 
the remedial PA. The remedial SI shall involve, as appropriate, both on- 
and off-site field investigatory efforts, and sampling.
    (3) If the remedial SI indicates that removal action may be 
appropriate, the lead agency shall initiate removal site evaluation 
pursuant to Sec. 300.410.
    (4) Prior to conducting field sampling as part of site inspections, 
the lead agency shall develop sampling and analysis plans that shall 
provide a process for obtaining data of sufficient quality and quantity 
to satisfy data needs. The sampling and analysis plans shall consist of 
two parts:
    (i) The field sampling plan, which describes the number, type, and 
location of samples, and the type of analyses, and
    (ii) The quality assurance project plan (QAPP), which describes 
policy, organization, and functional activities, and the data quality 
objectives and measures necessary to achieve adequate data for use in 
site evaluation and hazard ranking system activities.

[[Page 66]]

    (5) Upon completion of a remedial SI, the lead agency shall prepare 
a report that includes the following:
    (i) A description/history/nature of waste handling;
    (ii) A description of known contaminants;
    (iii) A description of pathways of migration of contaminants;
    (iv) An identification and description of human and environmental 
targets; and
    (v) A recommendation on whether further action is warranted.


<R05>
Sec. 300.425  Establishing remedial priorities.

    (a) General. The purpose of this section is to identify the criteria 
as well as the methods and procedures EPA uses to establish its 
priorities for remedial actions.
    (b) National Priorities List. The NPL is the list of priority 
releases for long-term remedial evaluation and response.
    (1) Only those releases included on the NPL shall be considered 
eligible for Fund-financed remedial action. Removal actions (including 
remedial planning activities, RI/FSs, and other actions taken pursuant 
to CERCLA section 104(b)) are not limited to NPL sites.
    (2) Inclusion of a release on the NPL does not imply that monies 
will be expended, nor does the rank of a release on the NPL establish 
the precise priorities for the allocation of Fund resources. EPA may 
also pursue other appropriate authorities to remedy the release, 
including enforcement actions under CERCLA and other laws. A site's rank 
on the NPL serves, along with other factors, including enforcement 
actions, as a basis to guide the allocation of Fund resources among 
releases.
    (3) Federal facilities that meet the criteria identified in 
paragraph (c) of this section are eligible for inclusion on the NPL. 
Except as provided by CERCLA sections 111(e)(3) and 111(c), federal 
facilities are not eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions.
    (4) Inclusion on the NPL is not a precondition to action by the lead 
agency under CERCLA sections 106 or 122 or to action under CERCLA 
section 107 for recovery of non-Fund-financed costs or Fund-financed 
costs other than Fund-financed remedial construction costs.
    (c) Methods for determining eligibility for NPL. A release may be 
included on the NPL if the release meets one of the following criteria:
    (1) The release scores sufficiently high pursuant to the Hazard 
Ranking System described in appendix A to this part.
    (2) A state (not including Indian tribes) has designated a release 
as its highest priority. States may make only one such designation; or
    (3) The release satisfies all of the following criteria:
    (i) The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry has issued 
a health advisory that recommends dissociation of individuals from the 
release;
    (ii) EPA determines that the release poses a significant threat to 
public health; and
    (iii) EPA anticipates that it will be more cost-effective to use its 
remedial authority than to use removal authority to respond to the 
release.
    (d) Procedures for placing sites on the NPL. Lead agencies may 
submit candidates to EPA by scoring the release using the HRS and 
providing the appropriate backup documentation.
    (1) Lead agencies may submit HRS scoring packages to EPA anytime 
throughout the year.
    (2) EPA shall review lead agencies' HRS scoring packages and revise 
them as appropriate. EPA shall develop any additional HRS scoring 
packages on releases known to EPA.
    (3) EPA shall compile the NPL based on the methods identified in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (4) EPA shall update the NPL at least once a year.
    (5) To ensure public involvement during the proposal to add a 
release to the NPL, EPA shall:
    (i) Publish the proposed rule in the Federal Register and solicit 
comments through a public comment period; and
    (ii) Publish the final rule in the Federal Register, and make 
available a response to each significant comment and any significant new 
data submitted during the comment period.

[[Page 67]]

    (6) Releases may be categorized on the NPL when deemed appropriate 
by EPA.
    (e) Deletion from the NPL. Releases may be deleted from or 
recategorized on the NPL where no further response is appropriate.
    (1) EPA shall consult with the state on proposed deletions from the 
NPL prior to developing the notice of intent to delete. In making a 
determination to delete a release from the NPL, EPA shall consider, in 
consultation with the state, whether any of the following criteria has 
been met:
    (i) Responsible parties or other persons have implemented all 
appropriate response actions required;
    (ii) All appropriate Fund-financed response under CERCLA has been 
implemented, and no further response action by responsible parties is 
appropriate; or
    (iii) The remedial investigation has shown that the release poses no 
significant threat to public health or the environment and, therefore, 
taking of remedial measures is not appropriate.
    (2) Releases shall not be deleted from the NPL until the state in 
which the release was located has concurred on the proposed deletion. 
EPA shall provide the state 30 working days for review of the deletion 
notice prior to its publication in the Federal Register.
    (3) All releases deleted from the NPL are eligible for further Fund-
financed remedial actions should future conditions warrant such action. 
Whenever there is a significant release from a site deleted from the 
NPL, the site shall be restored to the NPL without application of the 
HRS.
    (4) To ensure public involvement during the proposal to delete a 
release from the NPL, EPA shall:
    (i) Publish a notice of intent to delete in the Federal Register and 
solicit comment through a public comment period of a minimum of 30 
calendar days;
    (ii) In a major local newspaper of general circulation at or near 
the release that is proposed for deletion, publish a notice of 
availability of the notice of intent to delete;
    (iii) Place copies of information supporting the proposed deletion 
in the information repository, described in Sec. 300.430(c)(2)(iii), at 
or near the release proposed for deletion. These items shall be 
available for public inspection and copying; and
    (iv) Respond to each significant comment and any significant new 
data submitted during the comment period and include this response 
document in the final deletion package.
    (5) EPA shall place the final deletion package in the local 
information repository once the notice of final deletion has been 
published in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 300.430  Remedial investigation/feasibility study and selection of remedy.

    (a) General--(1) Introduction. The purpose of the remedy selection 
process is to implement remedies that eliminate, reduce, or control 
risks to human health and the environment. Remedial actions are to be 
implemented as soon as site data and information make it possible to do 
so. Accordingly, EPA has established the following program goal, 
expectations, and program management principles to assist in the 
identification and implementation of appropriate remedial actions.
    (i) Program goal. The national goal of the remedy selection process 
is to select remedies that are protective of human health and the 
environment, that maintain protection over time, and that minimize 
untreated waste.
    (ii) Program management principles. EPA generally shall consider the 
following general principles of program management during the remedial 
process:
    (A) Sites should generally be remediated in operable units when 
early actions are necessary or appropriate to achieve significant risk 
reduction quickly, when phased analysis and response is necessary or 
appropriate given the size or complexity of the site, or to expedite the 
completion of total site cleanup.
    (B) Operable units, including interim action operable units, should 
not be inconsistent with nor preclude implementation of the expected 
final remedy.
    (C) Site-specific data needs, the evaluation of alternatives, and 
the documentation of the selected remedy

[[Page 68]]

should reflect the scope and complexity of the site problems being 
addressed.
    (iii) Expectations. EPA generally shall consider the following 
expectations in developing appropriate remedial alternatives:
    (A) EPA expects to use treatment to address the principal threats 
posed by a site, wherever practicable. Principal threats for which 
treatment is most likely to be appropriate include liquids, areas 
contaminated with high concentrations of toxic compounds, and highly 
mobile materials.
    (B) EPA expects to use engineering controls, such as containment, 
for waste that poses a relatively low long-term threat or where 
treatment is impracticable.
    (C) EPA expects to use a combination of methods, as appropriate, to 
achieve protection of human health and the environment. In appropriate 
site situations, treatment of the principal threats posed by a site, 
with priority placed on treating waste that is liquid, highly toxic or 
highly mobile, will be combined with engineering controls (such as 
containment) and institutional controls, as appropriate, for treatment 
residuals and untreated waste.
    (D) EPA expects to use institutional controls such as water use and 
deed restrictions to supplement engineering controls as appropriate for 
short- and long-term management to prevent or limit exposure to 
hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. Institutional 
controls may be used during the conduct of the remedial investigation/
feasibility study (RI/FS) and implementation of the remedial action and, 
where necessary, as a component of the completed remedy. The use of 
institutional controls shall not substitute for active response measures 
(e.g., treatment and/or containment of source material, restoration of 
ground waters to their beneficial uses) as the sole remedy unless such 
active measures are determined not to be practicable, based on the 
balancing of trade-offs among alternatives that is conducted during the 
selection of remedy.
    (E) EPA expects to consider using innovative technology when such 
technology offers the potential for comparable or superior treatment 
performance or implementability, fewer or lesser adverse impacts than 
other available approaches, or lower costs for similar levels of 
performance than demonstrated technologies.
    (F) EPA expects to return usable ground waters to their beneficial 
uses wherever practicable, within a timeframe that is reasonable given 
the particular circumstances of the site. When restoration of ground 
water to beneficial uses is not practicable, EPA expects to prevent 
further migration of the plume, prevent exposure to the contaminated 
ground water, and evaluate further risk reduction.
    (2) Remedial investigation/feasibility study. The purpose of the 
remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) is to assess site 
conditions and evaluate alternatives to the extent necessary to select a 
remedy. Developing and conducting an RI/FS generally includes the 
following activities: project scoping, data collection, risk assessment, 
treatability studies, and analysis of alternatives. The scope and timing 
of these activities should be tailored to the nature and complexity of 
the problem and the response alternatives being considered.
    (b) Scoping. In implementing this section, the lead agency should 
consider the program goal, program management principles, and 
expectations contained in this rule. The investigative and analytical 
studies should be tailored to site circumstances so that the scope and 
detail of the analysis is appropriate to the complexity of site problems 
being addressed. During scoping, the lead and support agencies shall 
confer to identify the optimal set and sequence of actions necessary to 
address site problems. Specifically, the lead agency shall:
    (1) Assemble and evaluate existing data on the site, including the 
results of any removal actions, remedial preliminary assessment and site 
inspections, and the NPL listing process.
    (2) Develop a conceptual understanding of the site based on the 
evaluation of existing data described in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section.
    (3) Identify likely response scenarios and potentially applicable 
technologies

[[Page 69]]

and operable units that may address site problems.
    (4) Undertake limited data collection efforts or studies where this 
information will assist in scoping the RI/FS or accelerate response 
actions, and begin to identify the need for treatability studies, as 
appropriate.
    (5) Identify the type, quality, and quantity of the data that will 
be collected during the RI/FS to support decisions regarding remedial 
response activities.
    (6) Prepare site-specific health and safety plans that shall 
specify, at a minimum, employee training and protective equipment, 
medical surveillance requirements, standard operating procedures, and a 
contingency plan that conforms with 29 CFR 1910.120 (l)(1) and (l)(2).
    (7) If natural resources are or may be injured by the release, 
ensure that state and federal trustees of the affected natural resources 
have been notified in order that the trustees may initiate appropriate 
actions, including those identified in subpart G of this part. The lead 
agency shall seek to coordinate necessary assessments, evaluations, 
investigations, and planning with such state and federal trustees.
    (8) Develop sampling and analysis plans that shall provide a process 
for obtaining data of sufficient quality and quantity to satisfy data 
needs. Sampling and analysis plans shall be reviewed and approved by 
EPA. The sampling and analysis plans shall consist of two parts:
    (i) The field sampling plan, which describes the number, type, and 
location of samples and the type of analyses; and
    (ii) The quality assurance project plan, which describes policy, 
organization, and functional activities and the data quality objectives 
and measures necessary to achieve adequate data for use in selecting the 
appropriate remedy.
    (9) Initiate the identification of potential federal and state ARARs 
and, as appropriate, other criteria, advisories, or guidance to be 
considered.
    (c) Community relations. (1) The community relations requirements 
described in this section apply to all remedial activities undertaken 
pursuant to CERCLA section 104 and to section 106 or section 122 consent 
orders or decrees, or section 106 administrative orders.
    (2) The lead agency shall provide for the conduct of the following 
community relations activities, to the extent practicable, prior to 
commencing field work for the remedial investigation:
    (i) Conducting interviews with local officials, community residents, 
public interest groups, or other interested or affected parties, as 
appropriate, to solicit their concerns and information needs, and to 
learn how and when citizens would like to be involved in the Superfund 
process.
    (ii) Preparing a formal community relations plan (CRP), based on the 
community interviews and other relevant information, specifying the 
community relations activities that the lead agency expects to undertake 
during the remedial response. The purpose of the CRP is to:
    (A) Ensure the public appropriate opportunities for involvement in a 
wide variety of site-related decisions, including site analysis and 
characterization, alternatives analysis, and selection of remedy;
    (B) Determine, based on community interviews, appropriate activities 
to ensure such public involvement, and
    (C) Provide appropriate opportunities for the community to learn 
about the site.
    (iii) Establishing at least one local information repository at or 
near the location of the response action. Each information repository 
should contain a copy of items made available to the public, including 
information that describes the technical assistance grants application 
process. The lead agency shall inform interested parties of the 
establishment of the information repository.
    (iv) Informing the community of the availability of technical 
assistance grants.
    (3) For PRP actions, the lead agency shall plan and implement the 
community relations program at a site. PRPs may participate in aspects 
of the community relations program at the discretion of and with 
oversight by the lead agency.

[[Page 70]]

    (4) The lead agency may conduct technical discussions involving PRPs 
and the public. These technical discussions may be held separately from, 
but contemporaneously with, the negotiations/settlement discussions.
    (5) In addition, the following provisions specifically apply to 
enforcement actions:
    (i) Lead agencies entering into an enforcement agreement with de 
minimis parties under CERCLA section 122(g) or cost recovery settlements 
under section 122(h) shall publish a notice of the proposed agreement in 
the Federal Register at least 30 days before the agreement becomes 
final, as required by section 122(i). The notice must identify the name 
of the facility and the parties to the proposed agreement and must allow 
an opportunity for comment and consideration of comments; and
    (ii) Where the enforcement agreement is embodied in a consent 
decree, public notice and opportunity for public comment shall be 
provided in accordance with 28 CFR 50.7.
    (d) Remedial investigation. (1) The purpose of the remedial 
investigation (RI) is to collect data necessary to adequately 
characterize the site for the purpose of developing and evaluating 
effective remedial alternatives. To characterize the site, the lead 
agency shall, as appropriate, conduct field investigations, including 
treatability studies, and conduct a baseline risk assessment. The RI 
provides information to assess the risks to human health and the 
environment and to support the development, evaluation, and selection of 
appropriate response alternatives. Site characterization may be 
conducted in one or more phases to focus sampling efforts and increase 
the efficiency of the investigation. Because estimates of actual or 
potential exposures and associated impacts on human and environmental 
receptors may be refined throughout the phases of the RI as new 
information is obtained, site characterization activities should be 
fully integrated with the development and evaluation of alternatives in 
the feasibility study. Bench- or pilot-scale treatability studies shall 
be conducted, when appropriate and practicable, to provide additional 
data for the detailed analysis and to support engineering design of 
remedial alternatives.
    (2) The lead agency shall characterize the nature of and threat 
posed by the hazardous substances and hazardous materials and gather 
data necessary to assess the extent to which the release poses a threat 
to human health or the environment or to support the analysis and design 
of potential response actions by conducting, as appropriate, field 
investigations to assess the following factors:
    (i) Physical characteristics of the site, including important 
surface features, soils, geology, hydrogeology, meteorology, and 
ecology;
    (ii) Characteristics or classifications of air, surface water, and 
ground water;
    (iii) The general characteristics of the waste, including 
quantities, state, concentration, toxicity, propensity to bioaccumulate, 
persistence, and mobility;
    (iv) The extent to which the source can be adequately identified and 
characterized;
    (v) Actual and potential exposure pathways through environmental 
media;
    (vi) Actual and potential exposure routes, for example, inhalation 
and ingestion; and
    (vii) Other factors, such as sensitive populations, that pertain to 
the characterization of the site or support the analysis of potential 
remedial action alternatives.
    (3) The lead and support agency shall identify their respective 
potential ARARs related to the location of and contaminants at the site 
in a timely manner. The lead and support agencies may also, as 
appropriate, identify other pertinent advisories, criteria, or guidance 
in a timely manner (see Sec. 300.400(g)(3)).
    (4) Using the data developed under paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this 
section, the lead agency shall conduct a site-specific baseline risk 
assessment to characterize the current and potential threats to human 
health and the environment that may be posed by contaminants migrating 
to ground water or surface water, releasing to air, leaching through 
soil, remaining in the soil, and bioaccumulating in the food chain. The 
results of the baseline risk

[[Page 71]]

assessment will help establish acceptable exposure levels for use in 
developing remedial alternatives in the FS, as described in paragraph 
(e) of this section.
    (e) Feasibility study. (1) The primary objective of the feasibility 
study (FS) is to ensure that appropriate remedial alternatives are 
developed and evaluated such that relevant information concerning the 
remedial action options can be presented to a decision-maker and an 
appropriate remedy selected. The lead agency may develop a feasibility 
study to address a specific site problem or the entire site. The 
development and evaluation of alternatives shall reflect the scope and 
complexity of the remedial action under consideration and the site 
problems being addressed. Development of alternatives shall be fully 
integrated with the site characterization activities of the remedial 
investigation described in paragraph (d) of this section. The lead 
agency shall include an alternatives screening step, when needed, to 
select a reasonable number of alternatives for detailed analysis.
    (2) Alternatives shall be developed that protect human health and 
the environment by recycling waste or by eliminating, reducing, and/or 
controlling risks posed through each pathway by a site. The number and 
type of alternatives to be analyzed shall be determined at each site, 
taking into account the scope, characteristics, and complexity of the 
site problem that is being addressed. In developing and, as appropriate, 
screening the alternatives, the lead agency shall:
    (i) Establish remedial action objectives specifying contaminants and 
media of concern, potential exposure pathways, and remediation goals. 
Initially, preliminary remediation goals are developed based on readily 
available information, such as chemical-specific ARARs or other reliable 
information. Preliminary remediation goals should be modified, as 
necessary, as more information becomes available during the RI/FS. Final 
remediation goals will be determined when the remedy is selected. 
Remediation goals shall establish acceptable exposure levels that are 
protective of human health and the environment and shall be developed by 
considering the following:
    (A) Applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements under 
federal environmental or state environmental or facility siting laws, if 
available, and the following factors:
    (1) For systemic toxicants, acceptable exposure levels shall 
represent concentration levels to which the human population, including 
sensitive subgroups, may be exposed without adverse effect during a 
lifetime or part of a lifetime, incorporating an adequate margin of 
safety;
    (2) For known or suspected carcinogens, acceptable exposure levels 
are generally concentration levels that represent an excess upper bound 
lifetime cancer risk to an individual of between 10<SUP>-4 and 10<SUP>-6 
using information on the relationship between dose and response. The 
10<SUP>-6 risk level shall be used as the point of departure for 
determining remediation goals for alternatives when ARARs are not 
available or are not sufficiently protective because of the presence of 
multiple contaminants at a site or multiple pathways of exposure;
    (3) Factors related to technical limitations such as detection/
quantification limits for contaminants;
    (4) Factors related to uncertainty; and
    (5) Other pertinent information.
    (B) Maximum contaminant level goals (MCLGs), established under the 
Safe Drinking Water Act, that are set at levels above zero, shall be 
attained by remedial actions for ground or surface waters that are 
current or potential sources of drinking water, where the MCLGs are 
relevant and appropriate under the circumstances of the release based on 
the factors in Sec. 300.400(g)(2). If an MCLG is determined not to be 
relevant and appropriate, the corresponding maximum contaminant level 
(MCL) shall be attained where relevant and appropriate to the 
circumstances of the release.
    (C) Where the MCLG for a contaminant has been set at a level of 
zero, the MCL promulgated for that contaminant under the Safe Drinking 
Water Act shall be attained by remedial actions for ground or surface 
waters that are current or potential sources of

[[Page 72]]

drinking water, where the MCL is relevant and appropriate under the 
circumstances of the release based on the factors in Sec. 300.400(g)(2).
    (D) In cases involving multiple contaminants or pathways where 
attainment of chemical-specific ARARs will result in cumulative risk in 
excess of 10<SUP>-4, criteria in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section 
may also be considered when determining the cleanup level to be 
attained.
    (E) Water quality criteria established under sections 303 or 304 of 
the Clean Water Act shall be attained where relevant and appropriate 
under the circumstances of the release.
    (F) An alternate concentration limit (ACL) may be established in 
accordance with CERCLA section 121(d)(2)(B)(ii).
    (G) Environmental evaluations shall be performed to assess threats 
to the environment, especially sensitive habitats and critical habitats 
of species protected under the Endangered Species Act.
    (ii) Identify and evaluate potentially suitable technologies, 
including innovative technologies;
    (iii) Assemble suitable technologies into alternative remedial 
actions.
    (3) For source control actions, the lead agency shall develop, as 
appropriate:
    (i) A range of alternatives in which treatment that reduces the 
toxicity, mobility, or volume of the hazardous substances, pollutants, 
or contaminants is a principal element. As appropriate, this range shall 
include an alternative that removes or destroys hazardous substances, 
pollutants, or contaminants to the maximum extent feasible, eliminating 
or minimizing, to the degree possible, the need for long-term 
management. The lead agency also shall develop, as appropriate, other 
alternatives which, at a minimum, treat the principal threats posed by 
the site but vary in the degree of treatment employed and the quantities 
and characteristics of the treatment residuals and untreated waste that 
must be managed; and
    (ii) One or more alternatives that involve little or no treatment, 
but provide protection of human health and the environment primarily by 
preventing or controlling exposure to hazardous substances, pollutants, 
or contaminants, through engineering controls, for example, containment, 
and, as necessary, institutional controls to protect human health and 
the environment and to assure continued effectiveness of the response 
action.
    (4) For ground-water response actions, the lead agency shall develop 
a limited number of remedial alternatives that attain site-specific 
remediation levels within different restoration time periods utilizing 
one or more different technologies.
    (5) The lead agency shall develop one or more innovative treatment 
technologies for further consideration if those technologies offer the 
potential for comparable or superior performance or implementability; 
fewer or lesser adverse impacts than other available approaches; or 
lower costs for similar levels of performance than demonstrated 
treatment technologies.
    (6) The no-action alternative, which may be no further action if 
some removal or remedial action has already occurred at the site, shall 
be developed.
    (7) As appropriate, and to the extent sufficient information is 
available, the short- and long-term aspects of the following three 
criteria shall be used to guide the development and screening of 
remedial alternatives:
    (i) Effectiveness. This criterion focuses on the degree to which an 
alternative reduces toxicity, mobility, or volume through treatment, 
minimizes residual risks and affords long-term protection, complies with 
ARARs, minimizes short-term impacts, and how quickly it achieves 
protection. Alternatives providing significantly less effectiveness than 
other, more promising alternatives may be eliminated. Alternatives that 
do not provide adequate protection of human health and the environment 
shall be eliminated from further consideration.
    (ii) Implementability. This criterion focuses on the technical 
feasibility and availability of the technologies each alternative would 
employ and the administrative feasibility of implementing the 
alternative. Alternatives that are technically or administratively 
infeasible or that would require equipment, specialists, or facilities 
that are

[[Page 73]]

not available within a reasonable period of time may be eliminated from 
further consideration.
    (iii) Cost. The costs of construction and any long-term costs to 
operate and maintain the alternatives shall be considered. Costs that 
are grossly excessive compared to the overall effectiveness of 
alternatives may be considered as one of several factors used to 
eliminate alternatives. Alternatives providing effectiveness and 
implementability similar to that of another alternative by employing a 
similar method of treatment or engineering control, but at greater cost, 
may be eliminated.
    (8) The lead agency shall notify the support agency of the 
alternatives that will be evaluated in detail to facilitate the 
identification of ARARs and, as appropriate, pertinent advisories, 
criteria, or guidance to be considered.
    (9) Detailed analysis of alternatives. (i) A detailed analysis shall 
be conducted on the limited number of alternatives that represent viable 
approaches to remedial action after evaluation in the screening stage. 
The lead and support agencies must identify their ARARs related to 
specific actions in a timely manner and no later than the early stages 
of the comparative analysis. The lead and support agencies may also, as 
appropriate, identify other pertinent advisories, criteria, or guidance 
in a timely manner.
    (ii) The detailed analysis consists of an assessment of individual 
alternatives against each of nine evaluation criteria and a comparative 
analysis that focuses upon the relative performance of each alternative 
against those criteria.
    (iii) Nine criteria for evaluation. The analysis of alternatives 
under review shall reflect the scope and complexity of site problems and 
alternatives being evaluated and consider the relative significance of 
the factors within each criteria. The nine evaluation criteria are as 
follows:
    (A) Overall protection of human health and the environment. 
Alternatives shall be assessed to determine whether they can adequately 
protect human health and the environment, in both the short- and long-
term, from unacceptable risks posed by hazardous substances, pollutants, 
or contaminants present at the site by eliminating, reducing, or 
controlling exposures to levels established during development of 
remediation goals consistent with Sec. 300.430(e)(2)(i). Overall 
protection of human health and the environment draws on the assessments 
of other evaluation criteria, especially long-term effectiveness and 
permanence, short-term effectiveness, and compliance with ARARs.
    (B) Compliance with ARARs. The alternatives shall be assessed to 
determine whether they attain applicable or relevant and appropriate 
requirements under federal environmental laws and state environmental or 
facility siting laws or provide grounds for invoking one of the waivers 
under paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(C) of this section.
    (C) Long-term effectiveness and permanence. Alternatives shall be 
assessed for the long-term effectiveness and permanence they afford, 
along with the degree of certainty that the alternative will prove 
successful. Factors that shall be considered, as appropriate, include 
the following:
    (1) Magnitude of residual risk remaining from untreated waste or 
treatment residuals remaining at the conclusion of the remedial 
activities. The characteristics of the residuals should be considered to 
the degree that they remain hazardous, taking into account their volume, 
toxicity, mobility, and propensity to bioaccumulate.
    (2) Adequacy and reliability of controls such as containment systems 
and institutional controls that are necessary to manage treatment 
residuals and untreated waste. This factor addresses in particular the 
uncertainties associated with land disposal for providing long-term 
protection from residuals; the assessment of the potential need to 
replace technical components of the alternative, such as a cap, a slurry 
wall, or a treatment system; and the potential exposure pathways and 
risks posed should the remedial action need replacement.
    (D) Reduction of toxicity, mobility, or volume through treatment. 
The degree to which alternatives employ recycling or treatment that 
reduces toxicity, mobility, or volume shall be assessed, including how 
treatment is used to address the principal threats posed by the site.

[[Page 74]]

Factors that shall be considered, as appropriate, include the following:
    (1) The treatment or recycling processes the alternatives employ and 
materials they will treat;
    (2) The amount of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants 
that will be destroyed, treated, or recycled;
    (3) The degree of expected reduction in toxicity, mobility, or 
volume of the waste due to treatment or recycling and the specification 
of which reduction(s) are occurring;
    (4) The degree to which the treatment is irreversible;
    (5) The type and quantity of residuals that will remain following 
treatment, considering the persistence, toxicity, mobility, and 
propensity to bioaccumulate of such hazardous substances and their 
constituents; and
    (6) The degree to which treatment reduces the inherent hazards posed 
by principal threats at the site.
    (E) Short-term effectiveness. The short-term impacts of alternatives 
shall be assessed considering the following:
    (1) Short-term risks that might be posed to the community during 
implementation of an alternative;
    (2) Potential impacts on workers during remedial action and the 
effectiveness and reliability of protective measures;
    (3) Potential environmental impacts of the remedial action and the 
effectiveness and reliability of mitigative measures during 
implementation; and
    (4) Time until protection is achieved.
    (F) Implementability. The ease or difficulty of implementing the 
alternatives shall be assessed by considering the following types of 
factors as appropriate:
    (1) Technical feasibility, including technical difficulties and 
unknowns associated with the construction and operation of a technology, 
the reliability of the technology, ease of undertaking additional 
remedial actions, and the ability to monitor the effectiveness of the 
remedy.
    (2) Administrative feasibility, including activities needed to 
coordinate with other offices and agencies and the ability and time 
required to obtain any necessary approvals and permits from other 
agencies (for off-site actions);
    (3) Availability of services and materials, including the 
availability of adequate off-site treatment, storage capacity, and 
disposal capacity and services; the availability of necessary equipment 
and specialists, and provisions to ensure any necessary additional 
resources; the availability of services and materials; and availability 
of prospective technologies.
    (G) Cost. The types of costs that shall be assessed include the 
following:
    (1) Capital costs, including both direct and indirect costs;
    (2) Annual operation and maintenance costs; and
    (3) Net present value of capital and O&M costs.
    (H) State acceptance. Assessment of state concerns may not be 
completed until comments on the RI/FS are received but may be discussed, 
to the extent possible, in the proposed plan issued for public comment. 
The state concerns that shall be assessed include the following:
    (1) The state's position and key concerns related to the preferred 
alternative and other alternatives; and
    (2) State comments on ARARs or the proposed use of waivers.
    (I) Community acceptance. This assessment includes determining which 
components of the alternatives interested persons in the community 
support, have reservations about, or oppose. This assessment may not be 
completed until comments on the proposed plan are received.
    (f) Selection of remedy--(1) Remedies selected shall reflect the 
scope and purpose of the actions being undertaken and how the action 
relates to long-term, comprehensive response at the site.
    (i) The criteria noted in paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this section are 
used to select a remedy. These criteria are categorized into three 
groups.
    (A) Threshold criteria. Overall protection of human health and the 
environment and compliance with ARARs (unless a specific ARAR is waived) 
are threshold requirements that each alternative must meet in order to 
be eligible for selection.
    (B) Primary balancing criteria. The five primary balancing criteria 
are long- 

[[Page 75]]

term effectiveness and permanence; reduction of toxicity, mobility, or 
volume through treatment; short-term effectiveness; implementability; 
and cost.
    (C) Modifying criteria. State and community acceptance are modifying 
criteria that shall be considered in remedy selection.
    (ii) The selection of a remedial action is a two-step process and 
shall proceed in accordance with Sec. 300.515(e). First, the lead 
agency, in conjunction with the support agency, identifies a preferred 
alternative and presents it to the public in a proposed plan, for review 
and comment. Second, the lead agency shall review the public comments 
and consult with the state (or support agency) in order to determine if 
the alternative remains the most appropriate remedial action for the 
site or site problem. The lead agency, as specified in Sec. 300.515(e), 
makes the final remedy selection decision, which shall be documented in 
the ROD. Each remedial alternative selected as a Superfund remedy will 
employ the criteria as indicated in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section 
to make the following determination:
    (A) Each remedial action selected shall be protective of human 
health and the environment.
    (B) On-site remedial actions selected in a ROD must attain those 
ARARs that are identified at the time of ROD signature or provide 
grounds for invoking a waiver under Sec. 300.430(f)(1)(ii)(C).
    (1) Requirements that are promulgated or modified after ROD 
signature must be attained (or waived) only when determined to be 
applicable or relevant and appropriate and necessary to ensure that the 
remedy is protective of human health and the environment.
    (2) Components of the remedy not described in the ROD must attain 
(or waive) requirements that are identified as applicable or relevant 
and appropriate at the time the amendment to the ROD or the explanation 
of significant difference describing the component is signed.
    (C) An alternative that does not meet an ARAR under federal 
environmental or state environmental or facility siting laws may be 
selected under the following circumstances:
    (1) The alternative is an interim measure and will become part of a 
total remedial action that will attain the applicable or relevant and 
appropriate federal or state requirement;
    (2) Compliance with the requirement will result in greater risk to 
human health and the environment than other alternatives;
    (3) Compliance with the requirement is technically impracticable 
from an engineering perspective;
    (4) The alternative will attain a standard of performance that is 
equivalent to that required under the otherwise applicable standard, 
requirement, or limitation through use of another method or approach;
    (5) With respect to a state requirement, the state has not 
consistently applied, or demonstrated the intention to consistently 
apply, the promulgated requirement in similar circumstances at other 
remedial actions within the state; or
    (6) For Fund-financed response actions only, an alternative that 
attains the ARAR will not provide a balance between the need for 
protection of human health and the environment at the site and the 
availability of Fund monies to respond to other sites that may present a 
threat to human health and the environment.
    (D) Each remedial action selected shall be cost-effective, provided 
that it first satisfies the threshold criteria set forth in 
Sec. 300.430(f)(1)(ii)(A) and (B). Cost-effectiveness is determined by 
evaluating the following three of the five balancing criteria noted in 
Sec. 300.430(f)(1)(i)(B) to determine overall effectiveness: long-term 
effectiveness and permanence, reduction of toxicity, mobility, or volume 
through treatment, and short-term effectiveness. Overall effectiveness 
is then compared to cost to ensure that the remedy is cost-effective. A 
remedy shall be cost-effective if its costs are proportional to its 
overall effectiveness.
    (E) Each remedial action shall utilize permanent solutions and 
alternative treatment technologies or resource recovery technologies to 
the maximum extent practicable. This requirement shall be fulfilled by 
selecting the alternative that satisfies paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) 
of this section and

[[Page 76]]

provides the best balance of trade-offs among alternatives in terms of 
the five primary balancing criteria noted in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(B) of 
this section. The balancing shall emphasize long-term effectiveness and 
reduction of toxicity, mobility, or volume through treatment. The 
balancing shall also consider the preference for treatment as a 
principal element and the bias against off-site land disposal of 
untreated waste. In making the determination under this paragraph, the 
modifying criteria of state acceptance and community acceptance 
described in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(C) of this section shall also be 
considered.
    (2) The proposed plan. In the first step in the remedy selection 
process, the lead agency shall identify the alternative that best meets 
the requirements in Sec. 300.430(f)(1), above, and shall present that 
alternative to the public in a proposed plan. The lead agency, in 
conjunction with the support agency and consistent with Sec. 300.515(e), 
shall prepare a proposed plan that briefly describes the remedial 
alternatives analyzed by the lead agency, proposes a preferred remedial 
action alternative, and summarizes the information relied upon to select 
the preferred alternative. The selection of remedy process for an 
operable unit may be initiated at any time during the remedial action 
process. The purpose of the proposed plan is to supplement the RI/FS and 
provide the public with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the 
preferred alternative for remedial action, as well as alternative plans 
under consideration, and to participate in the selection of remedial 
action at a site. At a minimum, the proposed plan shall:
    (i) Provide a brief summary description of the remedial alternatives 
evaluated in the detailed analysis established under paragraph (e)(9) of 
this section;
    (ii) Identify and provide a discussion of the rationale that 
supports the preferred alternative;
    (iii) Provide a summary of any formal comments received from the 
support agency; and
    (iv) Provide a summary explanation of any proposed waiver identified 
under paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(C) of this section from an ARAR.
    (3) Community relations to support the selection of remedy. (i) The 
lead agency, after preparation of the proposed plan and review by the 
support agency, shall conduct the following activities:
    (A) Publish a notice of availability and brief analysis of the 
proposed plan in a major local newspaper of general circulation;
    (B) Make the proposed plan and supporting analysis and information 
available in the administrative record required under subpart I of this 
part;
    (C) Provide a reasonable opportunity, not less than 30 calendar 
days, for submission of written and oral comments on the proposed plan 
and the supporting analysis and information located in the information 
repository, including the RI/FS. Upon timely request, the lead agency 
will extend the public comment period by a minimum of 30 additional 
days;
    (D) Provide the opportunity for a public meeting to be held during 
the public comment period at or near the site at issue regarding the 
proposed plan and the supporting analysis and information;
    (E) Keep a transcript of the public meeting held during the public 
comment period pursuant to CERCLA section 117(a) and make such 
transcript available to the public; and
    (F) Prepare a written summary of significant comments, criticisms, 
and new relevant information submitted during the public comment period 
and the lead agency response to each issue. This responsiveness summary 
shall be made available with the record of decision.
    (ii) After publication of the proposed plan and prior to adoption of 
the selected remedy in the record of decision, if new information is 
made available that significantly changes the basic features of the 
remedy with respect to scope, performance, or cost, such that the remedy 
significantly differs from the original proposal in the proposed plan 
and the supporting analysis and information, the lead agency shall:
    (A) Include a discussion in the record of decision of the 
significant changes and reasons for such changes, if the lead agency 
determines such changes could be reasonably anticipated by the public 
based on the alternatives and

[[Page 77]]

other information available in the proposed plan or the supporting 
analysis and information in the administrative record; or
    (B) Seek additional public comment on a revised proposed plan, when 
the lead agency determines the change could not have been reasonably 
anticipated by the public based on the information available in the 
proposed plan or the supporting analysis and information in the 
administrative record. The lead agency shall, prior to adoption of the 
selected remedy in the ROD, issue a revised proposed plan, which shall 
include a discussion of the significant changes and the reasons for such 
changes, in accordance with the public participation requirements 
described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section.
    (4) Final remedy selection. (i) In the second and final step in the 
remedy selection process, the lead agency shall reassess its initial 
determination that the preferred alternative provides the best balance 
of trade-offs, now factoring in any new information or points of view 
expressed by the state (or support agency) and community during the 
public comment period. The lead agency shall consider state (or support 
agency) and community comments regarding the lead agency's evaluation of 
alternatives with respect to the other criteria. These comments may 
prompt the lead agency to modify aspects of the preferred alternative or 
decide that another alternative provides a more appropriate balance. The 
lead agency, as specified in Sec. 300.515(e), shall make the final 
remedy selection decision and document that decision in the ROD.
    (ii) If a remedial action is selected that results in hazardous 
substances, pollutants, or contaminants remaining at the site above 
levels that allow for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure, the lead 
agency shall review such action no less often than every five years 
after initiation of the selected remedial action.
    (iii) The process for selection of a remedial action at a federal 
facility on the NPL, pursuant to CERCLA section 120, shall entail:
    (A) Joint selection of remedial action by the head of the relevant 
department, agency, or instrumentality and EPA; or
    (B) If mutual agreement on the remedy is not reached, selection of 
the remedy is made by EPA.
    (5) Documenting the decision. (i) To support the selection of a 
remedial action, all facts, analyses of facts, and site-specific policy 
determinations considered in the course of carrying out activities in 
this section shall be documented, as appropriate, in a record of 
decision, in a level of detail appropriate to the site situation, for 
inclusion in the administrative record required under subpart I of this 
part. Documentation shall explain how the evaluation criteria in 
paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this section were used to select the remedy.
    (ii) The ROD shall describe the following statutory requirements as 
they relate to the scope and objectives of the action:
    (A) How the selected remedy is protective of human health and the 
environment, explaining how the remedy eliminates, reduces, or controls 
exposures to human and environmental receptors;
    (B) The federal and state requirements that are applicable or 
relevant and appropriate to the site that the remedy will attain;
    (C) The applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements of other 
federal and state laws that the remedy will not meet, the waiver 
invoked, and the justification for invoking the waiver;
    (D) How the remedy is cost-effective, i.e., explaining how the 
remedy provides overall effectiveness proportional to its costs;
    (E) How the remedy utilizes permanent solutions and alternative 
treatment technologies or resource recovery technologies to the maximum 
extent practicable; and
    (F) Whether the preference for remedies employing treatment which 
permanently and significantly reduces the toxicity, mobility, or volume 
of the hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants as a principal 
element is or is not satisfied by the selected remedy. If this 
preference is not satisfied, the record of decision must explain why a 
remedial action involving such reductions in toxicity, mobility, or 
volume was not selected.
    (iii) The ROD also shall:

[[Page 78]]

    (A) Indicate, as appropriate, the remediation goals, discussed in 
paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, that the remedy is expected to 
achieve. Performance shall be measured at appropriate locations in the 
ground water, surface water, soils, air, and other affected 
environmental media. Measurement relating to the performance of the 
treatment processes and the engineering controls may also be identified, 
as appropriate;
    (B) Discuss significant changes and the response to comments 
described in paragraph (f)(3)(i)(F) of this section;
    (C) Describe whether hazardous substances, pollutants, or 
contaminants will remain at the site such that a review of the remedial 
action under paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section no less often than 
every five years shall be required; and
    (D) When appropriate, provide a commitment for further analysis and 
selection of long-term response measures within an appropriate time-
frame.
    (6) Community relations when the record of decision is signed. After 
the ROD is signed, the lead agency shall:
    (i) Publish a notice of the availability of the ROD in a major local 
newspaper of general circulation; and
    (ii) Make the record of decision available for public inspection and 
copying at or near the facility at issue prior to the commencement of 
any remedial action.


<R05>
Sec. 300.435  Remedial design/remedial action, operation and maintenance.

    (a) General. The remedial design/remedial action (RD/RA) stage 
includes the development of the actual design of the selected remedy and 
implementation of the remedy through construction. A period of operation 
and maintenance may follow the RA activities.
    (b) RD/RA activities. (1) All RD/RA activities shall be in 
conformance with the remedy selected and set forth in the ROD or other 
decision document for that site. Those portions of RD/RA sampling and 
analysis plans describing the QA/QC requirements for chemical and 
analytical testing and sampling procedures of samples taken for the 
purpose of determining whether cleanup action levels specified in the 
ROD are achieved, generally will be consistent with the requirements of 
Sec. 300.430(b)(8).
    (2) During the course of the RD/RA, the lead agency shall be 
responsible for ensuring that all federal and state requirements that 
are identified in the ROD as applicable or relevant and appropriate 
requirements for the action are met. If waivers from any ARARs are 
involved, the lead agency shall be responsible for ensuring that the 
conditions of the waivers are met.
    (c) Community relations. (1) Prior to the initiation of RD, the lead 
agency shall review the CRP to determine whether it should be revised to 
describe further public involvement activities during RD/RA that are not 
already addressed or provided for in the CRP.
    (2) After the adoption of the ROD, if the remedial action or 
enforcement action taken, or the settlement or consent decree entered 
into, differs significantly from the remedy selected in the ROD with 
respect to scope, performance, or cost, the lead agency shall consult 
with the support agency, as appropriate, and shall either:
    (i) Publish an explanation of significant differences when the 
differences in the remedial or enforcement action, settlement, or 
consent decree significantly change but do not fundamentally alter the 
remedy selected in the ROD with respect to scope, performance, or cost. 
To issue an explanation of significant differences, the lead agency 
shall:
    (A) Make the explanation of significant differences and supporting 
information available to the public in the administrative record 
established under Sec. 300.815 and the information repository; and
    (B) Publish a notice that briefly summarizes the explanation of 
significant differences, including the reasons for such differences, in 
a major local newspaper of general circulation; or
    (ii) Propose an amendment to the ROD if the differences in the 
remedial or enforcement action, settlement, or consent decree 
fundamentally alter the basic features of the selected remedy with 
respect to scope, performance, or cost. To amend the ROD, the lead 
agency, in conjunction with the support agency, as provided in 
Sec. 300.515(e), shall:

[[Page 79]]

    (A) Issue a notice of availability and brief description of the 
proposed amendment to the ROD in a major local newspaper of general 
circulation;
    (B) Make the proposed amendment to the ROD and information 
supporting the decision available for public comment;
    (C) Provide a reasonable opportunity, not less than 30 calendar 
days, for submission of written or oral comments on the amendment to the 
ROD. Upon timely request, the lead agency will extend the public comment 
period by a minimum of 30 additional days;
    (D) Provide the opportunity for a public meeting to be held during 
the public comment period at or near the facility at issue;
    (E) Keep a transcript of comments received at the public meeting 
held during the public comment period;
    (F) Include in the amended ROD a brief explanation of the amendment 
and the response to each of the significant comments, criticisms, and 
new relevant information submitted during the public comment period;
    (G) Publish a notice of the availability of the amended ROD in a 
major local newspaper of general circulation; and
    (H) Make the amended ROD and supporting information available to the 
public in the administrative record and information repository prior to 
the commencement of the remedial action affected by the amendment.
    (3) After the completion of the final engineering design, the lead 
agency shall issue a fact sheet and provide, as appropriate, a public 
briefing prior to the initiation of the remedial action.
    (d) Contractor conflict of interest. (1) For Fund-financed RD/RA and 
O&M activities, the lead agency shall:
    (i) Include appropriate language in the solicitation requiring 
potential prime contractors to submit information on their status, as 
well as the status of their subcontractors, parent companies, and 
affiliates, as potentially responsible parties at the site.
    (ii) Require potential prime contractors to certify that, to the 
best of their knowledge, they and their potential subcontractors, parent 
companies, and affiliates have disclosed all information described in 
Sec. 300.435(d)(1)(i) or that no such information exists, and that any 
such information discovered after submission of their bid or proposal or 
contract award will be disclosed immediately.
    (2) Prior to contract award, the lead agency shall evaluate the 
information provided by the potential prime contractors and:
    (i) Determine whether they have conflicts of interest that could 
significantly impact the performance of the contract or the liability of 
potential prime contractors or subcontractors.
    (ii) If a potential prime contractor or subcontractor has a conflict 
of interest that cannot be avoided or otherwise resolved, and using that 
potential prime contractor or subcontractor to conduct RD/RA or O&M work 
under a Fund-financed action would not be in the best interests of the 
state or federal government, an offeror or bidder contemplating use of 
that prime contractor or subcontractor may be declared nonresponsible or 
ineligible for award in accordance with appropriate acquisition 
regulations, and the contract may be awarded to the next eligible 
offeror or bidder.
    (e) Recontracting. (1) If a Fund-financed contract must be 
terminated because additional work outside the scope of the contract is 
needed, EPA is authorized to take appropriate steps to continue interim 
RAs as necessary to reduce risks to public health and the environment. 
Appropriate steps may include extending an existing contract for a 
federal-lead RA or amending a cooperative agreement for a state-lead RA. 
Until the lead agency can reopen the bidding process and recontract to 
complete the RA, EPA may take such appropriate steps as described above 
to cover interim work to reduce such risks, where:
    (i) Additional work is found to be needed as a result of such 
unforeseen situations as newly discovered sources, types, or quantities 
of hazardous substances at a facility; and
    (ii) Performance of the complete RA requires the lead agency to 
rebid the contract because the existing contract does not encompass this 
newly discovered work.
    (2) The cost of such interim actions shall not exceed $2 million.

[[Page 80]]

    (f) Operation and maintenance. (1) Operation and maintenance (O&M) 
measures are initiated after the remedy has achieved the remedial action 
objectives and remediation goals in the ROD, and is determined to be 
operational and functional, except for ground- or surface-water 
restoration actions covered under Sec. 300.435(f)(4). A state must 
provide its assurance to assume responsibility for O&M, including, where 
appropriate, requirements for maintaining institutional controls, under 
Sec. 300.510(c).
    (2) A remedy becomes ``operational and functional'' either one year 
after construction is complete, or when the remedy is determined 
concurrently by EPA and the state to be functioning properly and is 
performing as designed, whichever is earlier. EPA may grant extensions 
to the one-year period, as appropriate.
    (3) For Fund-financed remedial actions involving treatment or other 
measures to restore ground- or surface-water quality to a level that 
assures protection of human health and the environment, the operation of 
such treatment or other measures for a period of up to 10 years after 
the remedy becomes operational and functional will be considered part of 
the remedial action. Activities required to maintain the effectiveness 
of such treatment or measures following the 10-year period, or after 
remedial action is complete, whichever is earlier, shall be considered 
O&M. For the purposes of federal funding provided under CERCLA section 
104(c)(6), a restoration activity will be considered administratively 
``complete'' when:
    (i) Measures restore ground- or surface-water quality to a level 
that assures protection of human health and the environment;
    (ii) Measures restore ground or surface water to such a point that 
reductions in contaminant concentrations are no longer significant; or
    (iii) Ten years have elapsed, whichever is earliest.
    (4) The following shall not be deemed to constitute treatment or 
other measures to restore contaminated ground or surface water under 
Sec. 300.435(f)(3):
    (i) Source control maintenance measures; and
    (ii) Ground- or surface-water measures initiated for the primary 
purpose of providing a drinking-water supply, not for the purpose of 
restoring ground water.


<R05>
Sec. 300.440  Procedures for planning and implementing off-site response actions.

    (a) Applicability. (1) This section applies to any remedial or 
removal action involving the off-site transfer of any hazardous 
substance, pollutant, or contaminant as defined under CERCLA sections 
101 (14) and (33) (``CERCLA waste'') that is conducted by EPA, States, 
private parties, or other Federal agencies, that is Fund-financed and/or 
is taken pursuant to any CERCLA authority, including cleanups at Federal 
facilities under section 120 of CERCLA, and cleanups under section 311 
of the Clean Water Act (except for cleanup of petroleum exempt under 
CERCLA). Applicability extends to those actions taken jointly under 
CERCLA and another authority.
    (2) In cases of emergency removal actions under CERCLA, emergency 
actions taken during remedial actions, or response actions under section 
311 of the Clean Water Act where the release poses an immediate and 
significant threat to human health and the environment, the On-Scene 
Coordinator (OSC) may determine that it is necessary to transfer CERCLA 
waste off-site without following the requirements of this section.
    (3) This section applies to CERCLA wastes from cleanup actions based 
on CERCLA decision documents signed or consent decrees lodged after 
October 17, 1986 (``post-SARA CERCLA wastes'') as well as those based on 
CERCLA decision documents signed and consent decrees lodged prior to 
October 17, 1986 (``pre-SARA CERCLA wastes''). Pre-SARA and post-SARA 
CERCLA wastes are subject to the same acceptability criteria in 
Sec. 300.440(b)(1) and (2).
    (4) EPA (usually the EPA Regional Office) will determine the 
acceptability under this section of any facility selected for the 
treatment, storage, or disposal of CERCLA waste. EPA will determine if 
there are relevant releases or relevant violations at a facility prior 
to the facility's initial receipt of

[[Page 81]]

CERCLA waste. A facility which has previously been evaluated and found 
acceptable under this rule (or the preceding policy) is acceptable until 
the EPA Regional Office notifies the facility otherwise pursuant to 
Sec. 300.440(d).
    (5) Off-site transfers of those laboratory samples and treatability 
study CERCLA wastes from CERCLA sites set out in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) 
through (iii) of this section, are not subject to the requirements of 
this section. However, those CERCLA wastes may not be transferred back 
to the CERCLA site unless the Remedial Project Manager or OSC assures 
the proper management of the CERCLA waste samples or residues and gives 
permission to the laboratory or treatment facility for the samples and/
or residues to be returned to the site.
    (i) Samples of CERCLA wastes sent to a laboratory for 
characterization;
    (ii) RCRA hazardous wastes that are being transferred from a CERCLA 
site for treatability studies and that meet the requirements for an 
exemption for RCRA under 40 CFR 261.4(e); and
    (iii) Non-RCRA wastes that are being transferred from a CERCLA site 
for treatability studies and that are below the quantity threshold 
established at 40 CFR 261.4(e)(2).
    (b) Acceptability criteria. (1) Facility compliance. (i) A facility 
will be deemed in compliance for the purpose of this rule if there are 
no relevant violations at or affecting the unit or units receiving 
CERCLA waste:
    (A) For treatment to standards specified in 40 CFR part 268, subpart 
D, including any pre-treatment or storage units used prior to treatment;
    (B) For treatment to substantially reduce its mobility, toxicity or 
persistence in the absence of a defined treatment standard, including 
any pre-treatment or storage units used prior to treatment; or
    (C) For storage or ultimate disposal of CERCLA waste not treated to 
the previous criteria at the same facility.
    (ii) Relevant violations include significant deviations from 
regulations, compliance order provisions, or permit conditions designed 
to: ensure that CERCLA waste is destined for and delivered to authorized 
facilities; prevent releases of hazardous waste, hazardous constituents, 
or hazardous substances to the environment; ensure early detection of 
such releases; or compel corrective action for releases. Criminal 
violations which result in indictment are also relevant violations. In 
addition, violations of the following requirements may be considered 
relevant:
    (A) Applicable subsections of sections 3004 and 3005 of RCRA or, 
where applicable, other Federal laws (such as the Toxic Substances 
Control Act and subtitle D of RCRA);
    (B) Applicable sections of State environmental laws; and
    (C) In addition, land disposal units at RCRA subtitle C facilities 
receiving RCRA hazardous waste from response actions authorized or 
funded under CERCLA must be in compliance with RCRA section 3004(o) 
minimum technology requirements. Exceptions may be made only if the unit 
has been granted a waiver from these requirements under 40 CFR 264.301.
    (2) Releases. (i) Release is defined in Sec. 300.5 of this part. 
Releases under this section do not include:
    (A) De minimis releases;
    (B) Releases permitted under Federal programs or under Federal 
programs delegated to the States (Federally permitted releases are 
defined in Sec. 300.5), except to the extent that such releases are 
found to pose a threat to human health and the environment; or
    (C) Releases to the air that do not exceed standards promulgated 
pursuant to RCRA section 3004(n), or absent such standards, or where 
such standards do not apply, releases to the air that do not present a 
threat to human health or the environment.
    (ii) Releases from units at a facility designated for off-site 
transfer of CERCLA waste must be addressed as follows:
    (A) Receiving units at RCRA subtitle C facilities. CERCLA wastes may 
be transferred to an off-site unit regulated under subtitle C of RCRA, 
including a facility regulated under the permit-by-rule provisions of 40 
CFR 270.60 (a), (b) or (c), only if that unit is not releasing any 
hazardous waste, hazardous constituent, or hazardous substance into the 
ground water, surface water, soil or air.

[[Page 82]]

    (B) Other units at RCRA subtitle C land disposal facilities. CERCLA 
wastes may not be transferred to any unit at a RCRA subtitle C land 
disposal facility where a non-receiving unit is releasing any hazardous 
waste, hazardous constituent, or hazardous substance into the ground 
water, surface water, soil, or air, unless that release is controlled by 
an enforceable agreement for corrective action under subtitle C of RCRA 
or other applicable Federal or State authority. For purposes of this 
section, a RCRA ``land disposal facility'' is any RCRA facility at which 
a land disposal unit is located, regardless of whether a land disposal 
unit is the receiving unit.
    (C) Other units at RCRA subtitle C treatment, storage, and permit-
by-rule facilities. CERCLA wastes may not be transferred to any unit at 
a RCRA subtitle C treatment, storage or permit-by-rule facility, where a 
release of any hazardous waste, hazardous constituent, or hazardous 
substance from non-receiving units poses a significant threat to public 
health or the environment, unless that release is controlled by an 
enforceable agreement for corrective action under subtitle C of RCRA or 
other applicable Federal or State authority.
    (D) All other facilities. CERCLA wastes should not be transferred to 
any unit at an other-than-RCRA subtitle C facility if the EPA Regional 
Office has information indicating that an environmentally significant 
release of hazardous substances has occurred at that facility, unless 
the release is controlled by an enforceable agreement for corrective 
action under an applicable Federal or State authority.
    (iii) Releases are considered to be ``controlled'' for the purpose 
of this section as provided in Sec. 300.440 (f)(3)(iv) and (f)(3)(v). A 
release is not considered ``controlled'' for the purpose of this section 
during the pendency of administrative or judicial challenges to 
corrective action requirements, unless the facility has made the 
requisite showing under Sec. 300.440(e).
    (c) Basis for determining acceptability. (1) If a State finds that a 
facility within its jurisdiction is operating in non-compliance with 
state law requirements including the requirements of any Federal program 
for which the State has been authorized, EPA will determine, after 
consulting with the State as appropriate, if the violation is relevant 
under the rule and if so, issue an initial determination of 
unacceptability.
    (2) If a State finds that releases are occurring at a facility 
regulated under State law or a Federal program for which the State is 
authorized, EPA will determine, after consulting with the State as 
appropriate, if the release is relevant under the rule and if so, issue 
an initial determination of unacceptability.
    (3) EPA may also issue initial determinations of unacceptability 
based on its own findings. EPA can undertake any inspections, data 
collection and/or assessments necessary. EPA will then notify with the 
State about the results and issue a determination notice if a relevant 
violation or release is found.
    (d) Determination of unacceptability. (1) Upon initial determination 
by the EPA Regional Office that a facility being considered for the off-
site transfer of any CERCLA waste does not meet the criteria for 
acceptability stated in Sec. 300.440(b), the EPA Region shall notify the 
owner/operator of such facility, and the responsible agency in the State 
in which the facility is located, of the unacceptability finding. The 
notice will be sent by certified and first-class mail, return receipt 
requested. The certified notice, if not acknowledged by the return 
receipt card, should be considered to have been received by the 
addressee if properly sent by regular mail to the last address known to 
the EPA Regional Office.
    (2) The notice shall generally: state that based on available 
information from a RCRA Facility Assessment (RFA), inspection, or other 
data sources, the facility has been found not to meet the requirements 
of Sec. 300.440; cite the specific acts, omissions, or conditions which 
form the basis of these findings; and inform the owner/operator of the 
procedural recourse available under this regulation.
    (3) A facility which was previously evaluated and found acceptable 
under this rule (or the preceding policy) may continue to receive CERCLA 
waste for

[[Page 83]]

60 calendar days after the date of issuance of the notice, unless 
otherwise determined in accordance with paragraphs (d)(8) or (d)(9) of 
this section.
    (4) If the owner or operator of the facility in question submits a 
written request for an informal conference with the EPA Regional Office 
within 10 calendar days from the issuance of the notice, the EPA 
Regional Office shall provide the opportunity for such conference no 
later than 30 calendar days after the date of the notice, if possible, 
to discuss the basis for the underlying violation or release 
determination, and its relevance to the facility's acceptability to 
receive CERCLA cleanup wastes. State representatives may attend the 
informal conference, submit written comments prior to the informal 
conference, and/or request additional meetings with the EPA Region, 
relating to the unacceptability issue during the determination process. 
If no State representative is present, EPA shall notify the State of the 
outcome of the conference. An owner/operator may submit written comments 
by the 30th day after issuance of the notice, in addition to or instead 
of requesting an informal conference.
    (5) If the owner or operator neither requests an informal conference 
nor submits written comments, the facility becomes unacceptable to 
receive CERCLA waste on the 60th day after the notice is issued (or on 
such other date designated under paragraph (d)(9) of this section). The 
facility will remain unacceptable until such time as the EPA Regional 
Office notifies the owner or operator otherwise.
    (6) If an informal conference is held or written comments are 
received, the EPA Region shall decide whether or not the information 
provided is sufficient to show that the facility is operating in 
physical compliance with respect to the relevant violations cited in the 
initial notice of unacceptability, and that all relevant releases have 
been eliminated or controlled, as required in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, such that a determination of acceptability would be 
appropriate. EPA will notify the owner/operator in writing whether or 
not the information provided is sufficient to support a determination of 
acceptability. Unless EPA determines that information provided by the 
owner/operator and the State is sufficient to support a determination of 
acceptability, the facility becomes unacceptable on the 60th calendar 
day after issuance of the original notice of unacceptability (or other 
date established pursuant to paragraphs (d)(8) or (d)(9) of this 
section).
    (7) Within 10 days of hearing from the EPA Regional Office after the 
informal conference or the submittal of written comments, the owner/
operator or the State may request a reconsideration of the 
unacceptability determination by the EPA Regional Administrator (RA). 
Reconsideration may be by review of the record, by conference, or by 
other means deemed appropriate by the Regional Administrator; 
reconsideration does not automatically stay the determination beyond the 
60-day period. The owner/operator will receive notice in writing of the 
decision of the RA.
    (8) The EPA Regional Administrator may decide to extend the 60-day 
period if more time is required to review a submission. The facility 
owner/operator shall be notified in writing if the Regional 
Administrator extends the 60 days.
    (9) The EPA Regional Office may decide that a facility's 
unacceptability is immediately effective (or effective in less than 60 
days) in extraordinary situations such as, but not limited to, 
emergencies at the facility or egregious violations. The EPA Region 
shall notify the facility owner/operator of the date of unacceptability, 
and may modify timeframes for comments and other procedures accordingly.
    (e) Unacceptability during administrative and judicial challenges of 
corrective action decisions. For a facility with releases that are 
subject to a corrective action permit, order, or decree, an 
administrative or judicial challenge to the corrective action (or a 
challenge to a permit modification calling for additional corrective 
action) shall not be considered to be part of a corrective action 
``program'' controlling those releases and shall not act to stay a 
determination of unacceptability under this rule. However, such facility 
may remain acceptable to receive CERCLA waste during the pendency of the 
appeal or litigation if:

[[Page 84]]

    (1) It satisfies the EPA Regional Office that adequate interim 
corrective action measures will continue at the facility; or
    (2) It demonstrates to the EPA Regional Office the absence of a need 
to take corrective action during the short-term, interim period.

Either demonstration may be made during the 60-day review period in the 
context of the informal conference and RA reconsideration.
    (f) Re-evaluating unacceptability. If, after notification of 
unacceptability and the opportunity to confer as described in 
Sec. 300.440(d), the facility remains unacceptable, the facility can 
regain acceptability. A facility found to be unacceptable to receive 
CERCLA wastes based on relevant violations or releases may regain 
acceptability if the following conditions are met:
    (1) Judgment on the merits. The facility has prevailed on the merits 
in an administrative or judicial challenge to the finding of 
noncompliance or uncontrolled releases upon which the unacceptability 
determination was based.
    (2) Relevant violations. The facility has demonstrated to the EPA 
Region its return to physical compliance for the relevant violations 
cited in the notice.
    (3) Releases. The facility has demonstrated to the EPA Region that:
    (i) All releases from receiving units at RCRA subtitle C facilities 
have been eliminated and prior contamination from such releases is 
controlled by a corrective action program approved under subtitle C of 
RCRA;
    (ii) All releases from other units at RCRA subtitle C land disposal 
facilities are controlled by a corrective action program approved under 
subtitle C of RCRA;
    (iii) All releases from other units at RCRA subtitle C treatment and 
storage facilities do not pose a significant threat to human health or 
the environment, or are controlled by a corrective action program 
approved under subtitle C of RCRA.
    (iv) A RCRA subtitle C corrective action program may be incorporated 
into a permit, order, or decree, including the following: a corrective 
action order under RCRA section 3008(h), section 7003 or section 3013, a 
RCRA permit under 40 CFR 264.100 or 264.101, or a permit under an 
equivalent authority in a State authorized for corrective action under 
RCRA section 3004(u). Releases will be deemed controlled upon issuance 
of the order, permit, or decree which initiates and requires completion 
of one or more of the following: a RCRA Facility Investigation, a RCRA 
Corrective Measures Study, and/or Corrective Measures Implementation. 
The release remains controlled as long as the facility is in compliance 
with the order, permit, or decree, and enters into subsequent agreements 
for implementation of additional corrective action measures when 
necessary, except during periods of administrative or judicial 
challenges, when the facility must make a demonstration under 
Sec. 300.440(e) in order to remain acceptable.
    (v) Facilities with releases regulated under other applicable 
Federal laws, or State laws under a Federally-delegated program may 
regain acceptability under this section if the releases are deemed by 
the EPA Regional Office not to pose a threat to human health or the 
environment, or if the facility enters into an enforceable agreement 
under those laws to conduct corrective action activities to control 
releases. Releases will be deemed controlled upon the issuance of an 
order, permit, or decree which initiates and requires one or more of the 
following: a facility investigation, a corrective action study, and/or 
corrective measures implementation. The release remains controlled as 
long as the facility is in compliance with the order, permit, or decree, 
and enters into subsequent agreements for implementation of additional 
corrective measures when necessary, except during periods of 
administrative or judicial challenges, when the facility must make a 
demonstration under Sec. 300.440(e) in order to remain acceptable.
    (4) Prior to the issuance of a determination that a facility has 
returned to acceptability, the EPA Region shall notify the State in 
which the facility is located, and provide an opportunity for the State 
to discuss the facility's acceptability status with EPA.

[[Page 85]]

    (5) An unacceptable facility may be reconsidered for acceptability 
whenever the EPA Regional Office finds that the facility fulfills the 
criteria stated in Sec. 300.440(b). Upon such a finding, the EPA 
Regional Office shall notify the facility and the State in writing.

      Subpart F--State Involvement in Hazardous Substance Response

    Source: 55 FR 8853, Mar. 8, 1990, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 300.500  General.

    (a) EPA shall ensure meaningful and substantial state involvement in 
hazardous substance response as specified in this subpart. EPA shall 
provide an opportunity for state participation in removal, pre-remedial, 
remedial, and enforcement response activities. EPA shall encourage 
states to enter into an EPA/state Superfund Memorandum of Agreement 
(SMOA) under Sec. 300.505 to increase state involvement and strengthen 
the EPA/state partnership.
    (b) EPA shall encourage states to participate in Fund-financed 
response in two ways. Pursuant to Sec. 300.515(a), states may either 
assume the lead through a cooperative agreement for the response action 
or may be the support agency in EPA-lead remedial response. Section 
300.515 sets forth requirements for state involvement in EPA-lead 
remedial and enforcement response and also addresses comparable 
requirements for EPA involvement in state-lead remedial and enforcement 
response. Section 300.520 specifies requirements for state involvement 
in EPA-lead enforcement negotiations. Section 300.525 specifies 
requirements for state involvement in removal actions. In addition to 
the requirements set forth in this subpart, 40 CFR part 35, subpart O, 
``Cooperative Agreements and Superfund State Contracts for Superfund 
Response Actions,'' contains further requirements for state 
participation during response.


<R05>
Sec. 300.505  EPA/State Superfund Memorandum of Agreement (SMOA).

    (a) The SMOA may establish the nature and extent of EPA and state 
interaction during EPA-lead and state-lead response (Indian tribes 
meeting the requirements of Sec. 300.515(b) may be treated as states for 
purposes of this section). EPA shall enter into SMOA discussions if 
requested by a state. The following may be addressed in a SMOA:
    (1) The EPA/state or Indian tribe relationship for removal, pre-
remedial, remedial, and enforcement response, including a description of 
the roles and the responsibilities of each.
    (2) The general requirements for EPA oversight. Oversight 
requirements may be more specifically defined in cooperative agreements.
    (3) The general nature of lead and support agency interaction 
regarding the review of key documents and/or decision points in removal, 
pre-remedial, remedial, and enforcement response. The requirements for 
EPA and state review of each other's key documents when each is serving 
as the support agency shall be equivalent to the extent practicable. 
Review times agreed to in the SMOA must also be documented in site-
specific cooperative agreements or Superfund state contracts in order to 
be binding.
    (4) Procedures for modification of the SMOA (e.g., if EPA and a 
state agree that the lead and support agency roles and responsibilities 
have changed, or if modifications are required to achieve desired 
goals).
    (b) The SMOA and any modifications thereto shall be executed by the 
EPA Regional Administrator and the head of the state agency designated 
as lead agency for state implementation of CERCLA.
    (c) Site-specific agreements entered into pursuant to section 
104(d)(1) of CERCLA shall be developed in accordance with 40 CFR part 
35, subpart O. The SMOA shall not supersede such agreements.
    (d)(1) EPA and the state shall consult annually to determine 
priorities and make lead and support agency designations for removal, 
pre-remedial, remedial, and enforcement response to be conducted during 
the next fiscal year and to discuss future priorities and long-term 
requirements for response. These consultations shall include the 
exchange of information on both Fund-

[[Page 86]]

and non-Fund-financed response activities. The SMOA may describe the 
timeframe and process for the EPA/state consultation.
    (2) The following activities shall be discussed in the EPA/state 
consultations established in the SMOA, or otherwise initiated and 
documented in writing in the absence of a SMOA, on a site-specific basis 
with EPA and the state identifying the lead agency for each response 
action discussed:
    (i) Pre-remedial response actions, including preliminary assessments 
and site inspections;
    (ii) Hazard Ranking System scoring and NPL listing and deletion 
activities;
    (iii) Remedial phase activities, including remedial investigation/
feasibility study, identification of potential applicable or relevant 
and appropriate requirements (ARARs) under federal and state 
environmental laws and, as appropriate, other advisories, criteria, or 
guidance to be considered (TBCs), proposed plan, ROD, remedial design, 
remedial action, and operation and maintenance;
    (iv) Potentially responsible party (PRP) searches, notices to PRPs, 
response to information requests, PRP negotiations, oversight of PRPs, 
other enforcement actions pursuant to state law, and activities where 
the state provides support to EPA;
    (v) Compilation and maintenance of the administrative record for 
selection of a response action as required by subpart I of this part;
    (vi) Related site support activities;
    (vii) State ability to share in the cost and timing of payments; and
    (viii) General CERCLA implementation activities.
    (3) If a state is designated as the lead agency for a non-Fund-
financed action at an NPL site, the SMOA shall be supplemented by site-
specific enforcement agreements between EPA and the state which specify 
schedules and EPA involvement.
    (4) In the absence of a SMOA, EPA and the state shall comply with 
the requirements in Sec. 300.515(h). If the SMOA does not address all of 
the requirements specified in Sec. 300.515(h), EPA and the state shall 
comply with any unaddressed requirements in that section.


<R05>
Sec. 300.510  State assurances.

    (a) A Fund-financed remedial action undertaken pursuant to CERCLA 
section 104(a) cannot proceed unless a state provides its applicable 
required assurances. The assurances must be provided by the state prior 
to the initiation of remedial action pursuant to a Superfund state 
contract for EPA-lead (or political subdivision-lead) remedial action or 
pursuant to a cooperative agreement for a state-lead remedial action. 
The SMOA may not be used for this purpose. Federally recognized Indian 
tribes are not required to provide CERCLA section 104(c)(3) assurances 
for Fund-financed response actions. Further requirements pertaining to 
state, political subdivision, and federally recognized Indian tribe 
involvement in CERCLA response are found in 40 CFR part 35, subpart O.
    (b)(1) The state is not required to share in the cost of state- or 
EPA-lead Fund-financed removal actions (including remedial planning 
activities associated with remedial actions) conducted pursuant to 
CERCLA section 104 unless the facility was operated by the state or a 
political subdivision thereof at the time of disposal of hazardous 
substances therein and a remedial action is ultimately undertaken at the 
site. Such remedial planning activities include, but are not limited to, 
remedial investigations (RIs), feasibility studies (FSs), and remedial 
design (RD). States shall be required to share 50 percent, or greater, 
in the cost of all Fund-financed response actions if the facility was 
publicly operated at the time of the disposal of hazardous substances. 
For other facilities, except federal facilities, the state shall be 
required to share 10 percent of the cost of the remedial action.
    (2) CERCLA section 104(c)(5) provides that EPA shall grant a state 
credit for reasonable, documented, direct, out-of-pocket, non-federal 
expenditures subject to the limitations specified in CERCLA section 
104(c)(5). For a state to apply credit toward its cost share, it must 
enter into a cooperative agreement or Superfund state contract. The 
state must submit as soon as possible, but no later than at the time 
CERCLA section 104 assurances are provided for

[[Page 87]]

a remedial action, its accounting of eligible credit expenditures for 
EPA verification. Additional credit requirements are contained in 40 CFR 
part 35, subpart O.
    (3) Credit may be applied to a state's future cost share 
requirements at NPL sites for response expenditures or obligations 
incurred by the state or a political subdivision from January 1, 1978 to 
December 11, 1980, and for the remedial action expenditures incurred 
only by the state after October 17, 1986.
    (4) Credit that exceeds the required cost share at the site for 
which the credit is granted may be transferred to another site to offset 
a state's required remedial action cost share.
    (c)(1) Prior to a Fund-financed remedial action, the state must also 
provide its assurance in accordance with CERCLA section 104(c)(3)(A) to 
assume responsibility for operation and maintenance of implemented 
remedial actions for the expected life of such actions. In addition, 
when appropriate, as part of the O&M assurance, the state must assure 
that any institutional controls implemented as part of the remedial 
action at a site are in place, reliable, and will remain in place after 
the initiation of O&M. The state and EPA shall consult on a plan for 
operation and maintenance prior to the initiation of a remedial action.
    (2) After a joint EPA/State inspection of the implemented Fund-
financed remedial action under Sec. 300.515(g), EPA may share, for any 
extension period established in Sec. 300.435(f)(2), in the cost of the 
operation of the remedy to ensure that the remedy is operational and 
functional. In the case of restoration of ground or surface water, EPA 
shall share in the cost of the State's operation of ground- or surface-
water restoration remedial actions as specified in Sec. 300.435(f)(3).
    (d) In accordance with CERCLA sections 104 (c)(3)(B) and 121(d)(3), 
if the remedial action requires off-site storage, destruction, 
treatment, or disposal, the state must provide its assurance before the 
remedial action begins on the availability of a hazardous waste disposal 
facility that is in compliance with CERCLA section 121(d)(3) and is 
acceptable to EPA.
    (e)(1) In accordance with CERCLA section 104(c)(9), EPA shall not 
provide any remedial action pursuant to CERCLA section 104 until the 
state in which the release occurs enters into a cooperative agreement or 
Superfund state contract with EPA providing assurances deemed adequate 
by EPA that the state will assure the availability of hazardous waste 
treatment or disposal facilities which:
    (i) Have adequate capacity for the destruction, treatment, or secure 
disposition of all hazardous wastes that are reasonably expected to be 
generated within the state during the 20-year period following the date 
of such cooperative agreement or Superfund state contract and to be 
destroyed, treated, or disposed;
    (ii) Are within the state, or outside the state in accordance with 
an interstate agreement or regional agreement or authority;
    (iii) Are acceptable to EPA; and
    (iv) Are in compliance with the requirements of Subtitle C of the 
Solid Waste Disposal Act.
    (2) This rule does not address whether or not Indian tribes are 
states for purposes of this paragraph (e).
    (f) EPA may determine that an interest in real property must be 
acquired in order to conduct a response action. However, as provided in 
CERCLA section 104(j)(2), EPA may acquire an interest in real estate in 
order to conduct a remedial action only if the State in which the 
interest to be acquired is located provides assurances, through a 
contract, cooperative agreement or otherwise, that the State will accept 
transfer of the interest upon completion of the remedial action. For 
purposes of this paragraph, ``completion of the remedial action'' is the 
point at which operation and maintenance (O&M) measures would be 
initiated pursuant to Sec. 300.435(f). The State may accept a transfer 
of interest at an earlier point in time if agreed upon in writing by the 
State and EPA. Indian tribe assurances are to be provided as set out at 
40 CFR part 35, subpart O, Sec. 35.6110(b)(2).

<R05>
Sec. 300.515  Requirements for state involvement in remedial and enforcement response.

    (a) General. (1) States are encouraged to undertake actions 
authorized under subpart E. Section 104(d)(1) of CERCLA authorizes EPA 
to enter into cooperative agreements or contracts with a state, 
political subdivision, or a federally recognized Indian tribe to carry 
out Fund-financed response actions authorized under CERCLA, when EPA 
determines that the state, the political subdivision, or federally 
recognized Indian tribe has the capability to undertake such actions. 
EPA will use a cooperative agreement to transfer funds to those entities 
to undertake Fund-financed response activities. The requirements for 
states, political subdivisions, or Indian tribes to receive funds as a 
lead or support agency for response are addressed at 40 CFR part 35, 
subpart O.
    (2) For EPA-lead Fund-financed remedial planning activities, 
including, but not limited to, remedial investigations, feasibility 
studies, and remedial designs, the state agency acceptance of the 
support agency role during an EPA-lead response shall be documented in a 
letter, SMOA, or cooperative agreement. Superfund state contracts are 
unnecessary for this purpose.
    (3) Cooperative agreements and Superfund state contracts are only 
appropriate for non-Fund-financed response actions if a state intends to 
seek credit for remedial action expenses under Sec. 300.510.
    (b) Indian tribe involvement during response. To be afforded 
substantially the same treatment as states under section 104 of CERCLA, 
the governing body of the Indian tribe must:
    (1) Be federally recognized; and
    (2) Have a tribal governing body that is currently performing 
governmental functions to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the 
affected population or to protect the environment within a defined 
geographic area; and
    (3) Have jurisdiction over a site at which Fund-financed response, 
including pre-remedial activities, is contemplated.
    (c) State involvement in PA/SI and National Priorities List process. 
EPA shall ensure state involvement in the listing and deletion process 
by providing states opportunities for review, consultation, or 
concurrence specified in this section.
    (1) EPA shall consult with states as appropriate on the information 
to be used in developing HRS scores for releases.
    (2) EPA shall, to the extent feasible, provide the state 30 working 
days to review releases which were scored by EPA and which will be 
considered for placement on the National Priorities List (NPL).
    (3) EPA shall provide the state 30 working days to review and concur 
on the Notice of Intent to Delete a release from the NPL. Section 
300.425 describes the EPA/state consultation and concurrence process for 
deleting releases from the NPL.
    (d) State involvement in RI/FS process. A key component of the EPA/
state partnership shall be the communication of potential federal and 
state ARARs and, as appropriate, other pertinent advisories, criteria, 
or guidance to be considered (TBCs).
    (1) In accordance with Secs. 300.400(g) and 300.430, the lead and 
support agencies shall identify their respective potential ARARs and 
communicate them to each other in a timely manner, i.e., no later than 
the early stages of the comparative analysis described in 
Sec. 300.430(e)(9), such that sufficient time is available for the lead 
agency to consider and incorporate all potential ARARs without 
inordinate delays and duplication of effort. The lead and support 
agencies may also identify TBCs and communicate them in a timely manner.
    (2) When a state and EPA have entered into a SMOA, the SMOA may 
specify a consultation process which requires the lead agency to solicit 
potential ARARs at specified points in the remedial planning and remedy 
selection processes. At a minimum, the SMOA shall include the points 
specified in Sec. 300.515(h)(2). The SMOA shall specify timeframes for 
support agency response to lead agency requests to ensure that potential 
ARARs are identified and communicated in a timely manner. Such 
timeframes must also be documented in site-specific agreements. The SMOA 
may also discuss

[[Page 89]]

identification and communication of TBCs.
    (3) If EPA in its statement of a proposed plan intends to waive any 
state-identified ARARs, or does not agree with the state that a certain 
state standard is an ARAR, it shall formally notify the state when it 
submits the RI/FS report for state review or responds to the state's 
submission of the RI/FS report.
    (4) EPA shall respond to state comments on waivers from or 
disagreements about state ARARs, as well as the preferred alternative 
when making the RI/FS report and proposed plan available for public 
comment.
    (e) State involvement in selection of remedy. (1) Both EPA and the 
state shall be involved in preliminary discussions of the alternatives 
addressed in the FS prior to preparation of the proposed plan and ROD. 
At the conclusion of the RI/FS, the lead agency, in conjunction with the 
support agency, shall develop a proposed plan. The support agency shall 
have an opportunity to comment on the plan. The lead agency shall 
publish a notice of availability of the RI/FS report and a brief 
analysis of the proposed plan pursuant to Sec. 300.430(e) and (f). 
Included in the proposed plan shall be a statement that the lead and 
support agencies have reached agreement or, where this is not the case, 
a statement explaining the concerns of the support agency with the lead 
agency's proposed plan. The state may not publish a proposed plan that 
EPA has not approved. EPA may assume the lead from the state if 
agreement cannot be reached.
    (2)(i) EPA and the state shall identify, at least annually, sites 
for which RODs will be prepared during the next fiscal year, in 
accordance with Sec. 300.515(h)(1). For all EPA-lead sites, EPA shall 
prepare the ROD and provide the state an opportunity to concur with the 
recommended remedy. For Fund-financed state-lead sites, EPA and the 
state shall designate sites, in a site-specific agreement, for which the 
state shall prepare the ROD and seek EPA's concurrence and adoption of 
the remedy specified therein, and sites for which EPA shall prepare the 
ROD and seek the state's concurrence. EPA and the state may designate 
sites for which the state shall prepare the ROD for non-Fund-financed 
state-lead enforcement response actions (i.e., actions taken under state 
law) at an NPL site. The state may seek EPA's concurrence in the remedy 
specified therein. Either EPA or the state may choose not to designate a 
site as state-lead.
    (ii) State concurrence on a ROD is not a prerequisite to EPA's 
selecting a remedy, i.e., signing a ROD, nor is EPA's concurrence a 
prerequisite to a state's selecting a remedy at a non-Fund-financed 
state-lead enforcement site under state law. Unless EPA's Assistant 
Administrator for Solid Waste and Emergency Response or Regional 
Administrator concurs in writing with a state-prepared ROD, EPA shall 
not be deemed to have approved the state decision. A state may not 
proceed with a Fund-financed response action unless EPA has first 
concurred in and adopted the ROD. Section 300.510(a) specifies 
limitations on EPA's proceeding with a remedial action without state 
assurances.
    (iii) The lead agency shall provide the support agency with a copy 
of the signed ROD for remedial actions to be conducted pursuant to 
CERCLA.
    (iv) On state-lead sites identified for EPA concurrence, the state 
generally shall be expected to maintain its lead agency status through 
the completion of the remedial action.
    (f) Enhancement of remedy. (1) A state may ask EPA to make changes 
in or expansions of a remedial action selected under subpart E.
    (i) If EPA finds that the proposed change or expansion is necessary 
and appropriate to the EPA-selected remedial action, the remedy may be 
modified (consistent with Sec. 300.435(c)(2)) and any additional costs 
paid as part of the remedial action.
    (ii) If EPA finds that the proposed change or expansion is not 
necessary to the selected remedial action, but would not conflict or be 
inconsistent with the EPA-selected remedy, EPA may agree to integrate 
the proposed change or expansion into the planned CERCLA remedial work 
if:
    (A) The state agrees to fund the entire additional cost associated 
with the change or expansion; and

[[Page 90]]

    (B) The state agrees to assume the lead for supervising the state-
funded component of the remedy or, if EPA determines that the state-
funded component cannot be conducted as a separate phase or activity, 
for supervising the remedial design and construction of the entire 
remedy.
    (2) Where a state does not concur in a remedial action secured by 
EPA under CERCLA section 106, and the state desires to have the remedial 
action conform to an ARAR that has been waived under 
Sec. 300.430(f)(1)(ii)(C), a state may seek to have that remedial action 
so conform, in accordance with the procedures set out in CERCLA section 
121(f)(2) .
    (g) State involvement in remedial design/remedial action. The extent 
and nature of state involvement during remedial design and remedial 
action shall be specified in site-specific cooperative agreements or 
Superfund state contracts, consistent with 40 CFR part 35, subpart O. 
For Fund-financed remedial actions, the lead and support agencies shall 
conduct a joint inspection at the conclusion of construction of the 
remedial action to determine that the remedy has been constructed in 
accordance with the ROD and with the remedial design.
    (h) Requirements for state involvement in absence of SMOA. In the 
absence of a SMOA, EPA and the state shall comply with the requirements 
in Sec. 300.515(h). If the SMOA does not address all of the requirements 
specified in Sec. 300.515(h), EPA and the state shall comply with any 
unaddressed requirements in that section.
    (1) Annual consultations. EPA shall conduct consultations with 
states at least annually to establish priorities and identify and 
document in writing the lead for remedial and enforcement response for 
each NPL site within the state for the upcoming fiscal year. States 
shall be given the opportunity to participate in long-term planning 
efforts for remedial and enforcement response during these annual 
consultations.
    (2) Identification of ARARs and TBCs. The lead and support agencies 
shall discuss potential ARARs during the scoping of the RI/FS. The lead 
agency shall request potential ARARs from the support agency no later 
than the time that the site characterization data are available. The 
support agency shall communicate in writing those potential ARARs to the 
lead agency within 30 working days of receipt of the lead agency request 
for these ARARs. The lead and support agencies may also discuss and 
communicate other pertinent advisories, criteria, or guidance to be 
considered (TBCs). After the initial screening of alternatives has been 
completed but prior to initiation of the comparative analysis conducted 
during the detailed analysis phase of the FS, the lead agency shall 
request that the support agency communicate any additional requirements 
that are applicable or relevant and appropriate to the alternatives 
contemplated within 30 working days of receipt of this request. The lead 
agency shall thereafter consult the support agency to ensure that 
identified ARARs and TBCs are updated as appropriate.
    (3) Support agency review of lead agency documents. The lead agency 
shall provide the support agency an opportunity to review and comment on 
the RI/FS, proposed plan, ROD, and remedial design, and any proposed 
determinations on potential ARARs and TBCs. The support agency shall 
have a minimum of 10 working days and a maximum of 15 working days to 
provide comments to the lead agency on the RI/FS, ROD, ARAR/TBC 
determinations, and remedial design. The support agency shall have a 
minimum of five working days and a maximum of 10 working days to comment 
on the proposed plan.
    (i) Administrative record requirements. The state, where it is the 
lead agency for a Fund-financed site, shall compile and maintain the 
administrative record for selection of a response action under subpart I

                Subpart G--Trustees for Natural Resources

    Source: 59 FR 47450, Sept. 15, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 300.600  Designation of federal trustees.

    (a) The President is required to designate in the NCP those federal 
officials who are to act on behalf of the public as trustees for natural 
resources. Federal officials so designated will act pursuant to section 
107(f) of CERCLA, section 311(f)(5) of the CWA, and section 1006 of the 
OPA. Natural resources means land, fish, wildlife, biota, air, water, 
ground water, drinking water supplies, and other such resources 
belonging to, managed by, held in trust by, appertaining to, or 
otherwise controlled (hereinafter referred to as ``managed or 
controlled'') by the United States (including the resources of the 
exclusive economic zone).
    (b) The following individuals shall be the designated trustee(s) for 
general categories of natural resources, including their supporting 
ecosystems. They are authorized to act pursuant to section 107(f) of 
CERCLA, section 311(f)(5) of the CWA, or section 1006 of the OPA when 
there is injury to, destruction of, loss of, or threat to natural 
resources, including their supporting ecosystems, as a result of a 
release of a hazardous substance or a discharge of oil. Notwithstanding 
the other designations in this section, the Secretaries of Commerce and 
the Interior shall act as trustees of those resources subject to their 
respective management or control.
    (1) Secretary of Commerce. The Secretary of Commerce shall act as 
trustee for natural resources managed or controlled by DOC and for 
natural resources managed or controlled by other federal agencies and 
that are found in, under, or using waters navigable by deep draft 
vessels, tidally influenced waters, or waters of the contiguous zone, 
the exclusive economic zone, and the outer continental shelf. However, 
before the Secretary takes an action with respect to an affected 
resource under the management or control of another federal agency, he 
shall, whenever practicable, seek to obtain the concurrence of that 
other federal agency. Examples of the Secretary's trusteeship include 
the following natural resources and their supporting ecosystems: marine 
fishery resources; anadromous fish; endangered species and marine 
mammals; and the resources of National Marine Sanctuaries and National 
Estuarine Research Reserves.
    (2) Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary of the Interior shall 
act as

[[Page 92]]

trustee for natural resources managed or controlled by the DOI. Examples 
of the Secretary's trusteeship include the following natural resources 
and their supporting ecosystems: migratory birds; anadromous fish; 
endangered species and marine mammals; federally owned minerals; and 
certain federally managed water resources. The Secretary of the Interior 
shall also be trustee for those natural resources for which an Indian 
tribe would otherwise act as trustee in those cases where the United 
States acts on behalf of the Indian tribe.
    (3) Secretary for the land managing agency. For natural resources 
located on, over, or under land administered by the United States, the 
trustee shall be the head of the department in which the land managing 
agency is found. The trustees for the principal federal land managing 
agencies are the Secretaries of DOI, USDA, DOD, and DOE.
    (4) Head of authorized agencies. For natural resources located in 
the United States but not otherwise described in this section, the 
trustee shall be the head of the federal agency or agencies authorized 
to manage or control those resources.


<R05>
Sec. 300.605  State trustees.

    State trustees shall act on behalf of the public as trustees for 
natural resources, including their supporting ecosystems, within the 
boundary of a state or belonging to, managed by, controlled by, or 
appertaining to such state. For the purposes of subpart G of this part, 
the definition of the term ``state'' does not include Indian tribes. The 
governor of a state is encouraged to designate a state lead trustee to 
coordinate all state trustee responsibilities with other trustee 
agencies and with response activities of the RRT and OSC. The state's 
lead trustee would designate a representative to serve as contact with 
the OSC. This individual should have ready access to appropriate state 
officials with environmental protection, emergency response, and natural 
resource responsibilities. The EPA Administrator or USCG Commandant or 
their designees may appoint the state lead trustee as a member of the 
Area Committee. Response strategies should be coordinated between the 
state and other trustees and the OSC for specific natural resource 
locations in an inland or coastal zone and should be included in the 
Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments Plan annex of the ACP.


<R05>
Sec. 300.610  Indian tribes.

    The tribal chairmen (or heads of the governing bodies) of Indian 
tribes, as defined in Sec. 300.5, or a person designated by the tribal 
officials, shall act on behalf of the Indian tribes as trustees for the 
natural resources, including their supporting ecosystems, belonging to, 
managed by, controlled by, or appertaining to such Indian tribe, or held 
in trust for the benefit of such Indian tribe, or belonging to a member 
of such Indian tribe, if such resources are subject to a trust 
restriction on alienation. When the tribal chairman or head of the 
tribal governing body designates another person as trustee, the tribal 
chairman or head of the tribal governing body shall notify the President 
of such designation. Such officials are authorized to act when there is 
injury to, destruction of, loss of, or threat to natural resources, 
including their supporting ecosystems as a result of a release of a 
hazardous substance.


<R05>
Sec. 300.612  Foreign trustees.

    Pursuant to section 1006 of the OPA, foreign trustees shall act on 
behalf of the head of a foreign government as trustees for natural 
resources belonging to, managed by, controlled by, or appertaining to 
such foreign government.


<R05>
Sec. 300.615  Responsibilities of trustees.

    (a) Where there are multiple trustees, because of coexisting or 
contiguous natural resources or concurrent jurisdictions, they should 
coordinate and cooperate in carrying out these responsibilities.
    (b) Trustees are responsible for designating to the RRTs and the 
Area Committees, for inclusion in the RCP and the ACP, appropriate 
contacts to receive notifications from the OSCs/RPMs of discharges or 
releases.
    (c)(1) Upon notification or discovery of injury to, destruction of, 
loss of, or threat to natural resources, trustees may, pursuant to 
section 107(f) of

[[Page 93]]

CERCLA, or section 311(f)(5) of the CWA, take the following or other 
actions as appropriate:
    (i) Conduct a preliminary survey of the area affected by the 
discharge or release to determine if trust resources under their 
jurisdiction are, or potentially may be, affected;
    (ii) Cooperate with the OSC/RPM in coordinating assessments, 
investigations, and planning;
    (iii) Carry out damage assessments; or
    (iv) Devise and carry out a plan for restoration, rehabilitation, 
replacement, or acquisition of equivalent natural resources. In 
assessing damages to natural resources, the federal, state, and Indian 
tribe trustees have the option of following the procedures for natural 
resource damage assessments located at 43 CFR part 11.
    (2) Upon notification or discovery of injury to, destruction of, 
loss of, or loss of use of, natural resources, or the potential for 
such, resulting from a discharge of oil occurring after August 18, 1990, 
the trustees, pursuant to section 1006 of the OPA, are to take the 
following actions:
    (i) In accordance with OPA section 1006(c), determine the need for 
assessment of natural resource damages, collect data necessary for a 
potential damage assessment, and, where appropriate, assess damages to 
natural resources under their trusteeship; and
    (ii) As appropriate, and subject to the public participation 
requirements of OPA section 1006(c), develop and implement a plan for 
the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of the 
equivalent, of the natural resources under their trusteeship;
    (3)(i) The trustees, consistent with procedures specified in the 
Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments Plan Annex to the Area 
Contingency Plan, shall provide timely advice on recommended actions 
concerning trustee resources that are potentially affected by a 
discharge of oil. This may include providing assistance to the OSC in 
identifying/recommending pre-approved response techniques and in 
predesignating shoreline types and areas in ACPs.
    (ii) The trustees shall assure, through the lead administrative 
trustee, that the OSC is informed of their activities regarding natural 
resource damage assessment that may affect response operations in order 
to assure coordination and minimize any interference with such 
operations. The trustees shall assure, through the lead administrative 
trustee, that all data from the natural resource damage assessment 
activities that may support more effective operational decisions are 
provided in a timely manner to the OSC.
    (iii) When circumstances permit, the OSC shall share the use of 
federal response resources (including but not limited to aircraft, 
vessels, and booms to contain and remove discharged oil) with the 
trustees, providing trustee activities do not interfere with response 
actions. The lead administrative trustee facilitates effective and 
efficient communication between the OSC and the other trustees during 
response operations and is responsible for applying to the OSC for non-
monetary federal response resources on behalf of all trustees. The lead 
administrative trustee is also responsible for applying to the NPFC for 
funding for initiation of damage assessment for injuries to natural 
resources.
    (d) The authority of federal trustees includes, but is not limited 
to the following actions:
    (1) Requesting that the Attorney General seek compensation from the 
responsible parties for the damages assessed and for the costs of an 
assessment and of restoration planning; and
    (2) Participating in negotiations between the United States and 
potentially responsible parties to obtain PRP-financed or PRP-conducted 
assessments and restorations for injured resources or protection for 
threatened resources and to agree to covenants not to sue, where 
appropriate.
    (3) Requiring, in consultation with the lead agency, any person to 
comply with the requirements of CERCLA section 104(e) regarding 
information gathering and access.
    (4) Initiating damage assessments, as provided in OPA section 6002.
    (e) Actions which may be taken by any trustee pursuant to section 
107(f) of CERCLA, section 311(f)(5) of the

[[Page 94]]

CWA, or section 1006 of the OPA include, but are not limited to, any of 
the following:
    (1) Requesting that an authorized agency issue an administrative 
order or pursue injunctive relief against the parties responsible for 
the discharge or release; or
    (2) Requesting that the lead agency remove, or arrange for the 
removal of, or provide for remedial action with respect to, any oil or 
hazardous substances from a contaminated medium pursuant to section 104 
of CERCLA or section 311 of CWA.

<R05>
Sec. 300.700  Activities by other persons.

    (a) General. Except as provided (e.g., in CWA section 311(c)), any 
person may undertake a response action to reduce or eliminate a release 
of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant.
    (b) Summary of CERCLA authorities. The mechanisms available to 
recover the costs of response actions under CERCLA are, in summary:
    (1) Section 107(a), wherein any person may receive a court award of 
his or her response costs, plus interest, from the party or parties 
found to be liable;
    (2) Section 111(a)(2), wherein a private party, a PRP pursuant to a 
settlement agreement, or certain foreign entities may file a claim 
against the Fund for reimbursement of response costs;
    (3) Section 106(b), wherein any person who has complied with a 
section 106(a) order may petition the Fund for reimbursement of 
reasonable costs, plus interest; and
    (4) Section 123, wherein a general purpose unit of local government 
may apply to the Fund under 40 CFR part 310 for reimbursement of the 
costs of temporary emergency measures that are necessary to prevent or 
mitigate injury to human health or the environment associated with a 
release.
    (c) Section 107(a) cost recovery actions. (1) Responsible parties 
shall be liable for all response costs incurred by the United States 
government or a state or an Indian tribe not inconsistent with the NCP.
    (2) Responsible parties shall be liable for necessary costs of 
response actions to releases of hazardous substances incurred by any 
other person consistent with the NCP.
    (3) For the purpose of cost recovery under section 107(a)(4)(B) of 
CERCLA:
    (i) A private party response action will be considered ``consistent 
with the NCP'' if the action, when evaluated as a whole, is in 
substantial compliance with the applicable requirements in paragraphs 
(5) and (6) of this section, and results in a CERCLA-quality cleanup; 
and
    (ii) Any response action carried out in compliance with the terms of 
an order issued by EPA pursuant to section 106 of CERCLA, or a consent 
decree entered into pursuant to section 122 of CERCLA, will be 
considered ``consistent with the NCP.''
    (4) Actions under Sec. 300.700(c)(1) will not be considered 
``inconsistent with the NCP,'' and actions under Sec. 300.700(c)(2) will 
not be considered not ``consistent with the NCP,'' based on immaterial 
or insubstantial deviations from the provisions of 40 CFR part 300.
    (5) The following provisions of this Part are potentially applicable 
to private party response actions:
    (i) Section 300.150 (on worker health and safety);
    (ii) Section 300.160 (on documentation and cost recovery);
    (iii) Section 300.400(c)(1), (4), (5), and (7) (on determining the 
need for a Fund-financed action); (e) (on permit requirements) except 
that the permit waiver does not apply to private party response actions; 
and (g) (on identification of ARARs) except that applicable requirements 
of federal or state law may not be waived by a private party;
    (iv) Section 300.405(b), (c), and (d) (on reports of releases to the 
NRC);
    (v) Section 300.410 (on removal site evaluation) except paragraphs 
(f)(5) and (6);
    (vi) Section 300.415 (on removal actions) except paragraphs (a)(2), 
(b)(2)(vii), (b)(5), and (g); and including Sec. 300.415(j) with regard 
to meeting ARARs where practicable except that

[[Page 95]]

private party removal actions must always comply with the requirements 
of applicable law;
    (vii) Section 300.420 (on remedial site evaluation);
    (viii) Section 300.430 (on RI/FS and selection of remedy) except 
paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(C)(6) and that applicable requirements of federal 
or state law may not be waived by a private party; and
    (ix) Section 300.435 (on RD/RA and operation and maintenance).
    (6) Private parties undertaking response actions should provide an 
opportunity for public comment concerning the selection of the response 
action based on the provisions set out below, or based on substantially 
equivalent state and local requirements. The following provisions of 
this part regarding public participation are potentially applicable to 
private party response actions, with the exception of administrative 
record and information repository requirements stated therein:
    (i) Section 300.155 (on public information and community relations);
    (ii) Section 300.415(n) (on community relations during removal 
actions);

except paragraph (c)(5);
    (iv) Section 300.430(f)(2), (3), and (6) (on community relations 
during selection of remedy); and
    (v) Section 300.435(c) (on community relations during RD/RA and 
operation and maintenance).
    (7) When selecting the appropriate remedial action, the methods of 
remedying releases listed in appendix D of this part may also be 
appropriate to a private party response action.
    (8) Except for actions taken pursuant to CERCLA sections 104 or 106 
or response actions for which reimbursement from the Fund will be 
sought, any action to be taken by the lead agency listed in paragraphs 
(c)(5) through (c)(7) may be taken by the person carrying out the 
response action.
    (d) Section 111(a)(2) claims. (1) Persons, other than those listed 
in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, may be able to 
receive reimbursement of response costs by means of a claim against the 
Fund. The categories of persons excluded from pursuing this claims 
authority are:
    (i) Federal government;
    (ii) State governments, and their political subdivisions, unless 
they are potentially responsible parties covered by an order or consent 
decree pursuant to section 122 of CERCLA; and
    (iii) Persons operating under a procurement contract or an 
assistance agreement with the United States with respect to matters 
covered by that contract or assistance agreement, unless specifically 
provided therein.
    (2) In order to be reimbursed by the Fund, an eligible person must 
notify the Administrator of EPA or designee prior to taking a response 
action and receive prior approval, i.e., ``preauthorization,'' for such 
action.
    (3) Preauthorization is EPA's prior approval to submit a claim 
against the Fund for necessary response costs incurred as a result of 
carrying out the NCP. All applications for preauthorization will be 
reviewed to determine whether the request should receive priority for 
funding. EPA, in its discretion, may grant preauthorization of a claim. 
Preauthorization will be considered only for:
    (i) Removal actions pursuant to Sec. 300.415;
    (ii) CERCLA section 104(b) activities; and
    (iii) Remedial actions at National Priorities List sites pursuant to 
Sec. 300.435.
    (4) To receive EPA's prior approval, the eligible person must:
    (i) Demonstrate technical and other capabilities to respond safely 
and effectively to releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or 
contaminants; and
    (ii) Establish that the action will be consistent with the NCP in 
accordance with the elements set forth in paragraphs (c)(5) through (8) 
of this section.
    (5) EPA will grant preauthorization to a claim by a party it 
determines to be potentially liable under section 107 of CERCLA only in 
accordance with an order issued pursuant to section 106 of CERCLA, or a 
settlement with the federal government in accordance with section 122 of 
CERCLA.
    (6) Preauthorization does not establish an enforceable contractual 
relationship between EPA and the claimant.

[[Page 96]]

    (7) Preauthorization represents EPA's commitment that if funds are 
appropriated for response actions, the response action is conducted in 
accordance with the preauthorization decision document, and costs are 
reasonable and necessary, reimbursement will be made from the Superfund, 
up to the maximum amount provided in the preauthorization decision 
document.
    (8) For a claim to be awarded under section 111 of CERCLA, EPA must 
certify that the costs were necessary and consistent with the 
preauthorization decision document.
    (e) Section 106(b) petition. Subject to conditions specified in 
CERCLA section 106(b), any person who has complied with an order issued 
after October 16, 1986 pursuant to section 106(a) of CERCLA, may seek 
reimbursement for response costs incurred in complying with that order 
unless the person has waived that right.
    (f) Section 123 reimbursement to local governments. Any general 
purpose unit of local government for a political subdivision that is 
affected by a release may receive reimbursement for the costs of 
temporary emergency measures necessary to prevent or mitigate injury to 
human health or the environment subject to the conditions set forth in 
40 CFR part 310. Such reimbursement may not exceed $25,000 for a single 
response.
    (g) Release From Liability. Implementation of response measures by 
potentially responsible parties or by any other person does not release 
those parties from liability under section 107(a) of CERCLA, except as 
provided in a settlement under section 122 of CERCLA or a federal court 
judgment.
    (h) Oil Pollution Act Claims. Claims are authorized to be presented 
to the OSLTF under section 1013 of the OPA, for certain uncompensated 
removal costs or uncompensated damages resulting from the discharge, or 
substantial threat of discharge, of oil from a vessel or facility into 
or upon the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or exclusive 
economic zone of the United States. Anyone desiring to file a claim 
against the OSLTF may obtain general information on the procedure for 
filing a claim from the Director, National Pollution Funds Center, Suite 
1000, 4200 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, Virginia 22203-1804, (703) 235-

and other chemical or bioremediation products that may be authorized for 
use on oil discharges in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
Sec. 300.910. This schedule, called the NCP Product Schedule, may be 
obtained from the Emergency Response Division (5202-G), U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 
20460. The telephone number is 1-202-260-2342.
    (2) Products may be added to the NCP Product Schedule by the process 
specified in Sec. 300.920.
    (b) Hazardous Substance Releases. [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 300.910  Authorization of use.

    (a) RRTs and Area Committees shall address, as part of their 
planning activities, the desirability of using appropriate dispersants, 
surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, bioremediation 
agents, or miscellaneous oil spill control agents listed on the NCP 
Product Schedule, and the desirability of using appropriate burning 
agents. RCPs and ACPs shall, as appropriate, include applicable 
preauthorization plans and address the specific contexts in which such 
products should and should not be used. In meeting the provisions of 
this paragraph, preauthorization plans may address factors such as the 
potential sources and types of oil that might be spilled, the existence 
and location of environmentally sensitive resources that might be 
impacted by spilled oil, available product and storage locations, 
available equipment and adequately trained operators, and the available 
means to monitor product application and effectiveness. The RRT 
representatives from EPA and the states with jurisdiction over the 
waters of the area to which a preauthorization plan applies and the DOC 
and DOI natural resource trustees shall review and either approve, 
disapprove, or approve with modification the preauthorization plans 
developed by Area Committees, as appropriate. Approved preauthorization 
plans shall be included in the appropriate RCPs and ACPs. If the RRT 
representatives from EPA and the states with jurisdiction over the 
waters of the area to which a preauthorization plan applies and the DOC 
and DOI natural resource trustees approve in advance the use of certain 
products under specified circumstances as described in the 
preauthorization plan, the OSC may authorize the use of the products 
without obtaining the

[[Page 101]]

specific concurrences described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section.
    (b) For spill situations that are not addressed by the 
preauthorization plans developed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section, the OSC, with the concurrence of the EPA representative to the 
RRT and, as appropriate, the concurrence of the RRT representatives from 
the states with jurisdiction over the navigable waters threatened by the 
release or discharge, and in consultation with the DOC and DOI natural 
resource trustees, when practicable, may authorize the use of 
dispersants, surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, 
bioremediation agents, or miscellaneous oil spill control agents on the 
oil discharge, provided that the products are listed on the NCP Product 
Schedule.
    (c) The OSC, with the concurrence of the EPA representative to the 
RRT and, as appropriate, the concurrence of the RRT representatives from 
the states with jurisdiction over the navigable waters threatened by the 
release or discharge, and in consultation with the DOC and DOI natural 
resource trustees, when practicable, may authorize the use of burning 
agents on a case-by-case basis.
    (d) The OSC may authorize the use of any dispersant, surface washing 
agent, surface collecting agent, other chemical agent, burning agent, 
bioremediation agent, or miscellaneous oil spill control agent, 
including products not listed on the NCP Product Schedule, without 
obtaining the concurrence of the EPA representative to the RRT and, as 
appropriate, the RRT representatives from the states with jurisdiction 
over the navigable waters threatened by the release or discharge, when, 
in the judgment of the OSC, the use of the product is necessary to 
prevent or substantially reduce a hazard to human life. Whenever the OSC 
authorizes the use of a product pursuant to this paragraph, the OSC is 
to inform the EPA RRT representative and, as appropriate, the RRT 
representatives from the affected states and, when practicable, the DOC/
DOI natural resources trustees of the use of a product, including 
products not on the Schedule, as soon as possible. Once the threat to 
human life has subsided, the continued use of a product shall be in 
accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.
    (e) Sinking agents shall not be authorized for application to oil 
discharges.
    (f) When developing preauthorization plans, RRTs may require the 
performance of supplementary toxicity and effectiveness testing of 
products, in addition to the test methods specified in Sec. 300.915 and 
described in appendix C to part 300, due to existing site-specific or 
area-specific concerns.

60 days of the receipt of technical product data, of its decision on 
adding the product to the Schedule.
    (4) Certification. OSCs may request a written certification from 
manufacturers that produce sorbent materials that consist solely of the 
materials listed in paragraph (g)(1) of this section prior to making a 
decision on the use of a particular sorbent material. The certification 
at a minimum shall state that the sorbent consists solely of the 
materials listed in Sec. 300.915(g)(1) of the NCP. The following 
statement, when completed, dated, and signed by a sorbent manufacturer, 
is sufficient to meet the written certification requirement:

  [SORBENT NAME] is a sorbent material and consists solely of the 
materials listed in Sec. 300.915(g)(1) of the NCP.

    (h) Mixed products. Manufacturers of products that consist of 
materials that meet the definitions of two or more of the product 
categories contained on the NCP Product Schedule shall submit to EPA the 
technical product data specified in this section for each of those 
product categories. After review of the submitted technical product 
data, and the performance of required dispersant effectiveness and 
toxicity tests, if appropriate, EPA will make a determination on whether 
and under which category the mixed product should be listed on the 
Schedule.


<R05>
Sec. 300.920  Addition of products to Schedule.

    (a) Dispersants. (1) To add a dispersant to the NCP Product 
Schedule, submit the technical product data specified in Sec. 300.915(a) 
to the Emergency Response Division (5202-G), U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW, Washington, DC 20460. A dispersant 
must attain an effectiveness value of 45 percent or greater in order to 
be added to the Schedule.
    (2) EPA reserves the right to request further documentation of the 
manufacturers' test results. EPA also reserves the right to verify test 
results and consider the results of EPA's verification testing in 
determining whether the dispersant meets listing criteria. EPA will, 
within 60 days of receiving a complete application as specified in 
Sec. 300.915(a) of this part, notify the manufacturer of its decision to 
list the product on the Schedule, or request additional information and/
or a sample of the product in order to review and/or conduct validation 
sampling. If EPA requests additional information and/or a product 
sample, within 60 days of receiving such additional information or 
sample, EPA will then notify the manufacturer in writing of its decision 
to list or not list the product.
    (3) Request for review of decision. (i) A manufacturer whose product 
was determined to be ineligible for listing on the NCP Product Schedule 
may request EPA's Administrator to review the determination. The request 
must be made in writing within 30 days of receiving notification of 
EPA's decision to not list the dispersant on the Schedule. The request 
shall contain a clear and concise statement with supporting facts and 
technical analysis demonstrating that EPA's decision was incorrect.
    (ii) The Administrator or his designee may request additional 
information from the manufacturer, or from any other person, and may 
provide for a conference between EPA and the manufacturer, if 
appropriate. The Administrator or his designee shall render a decision 
within 60 days of receiving the request, or within 60 days of receiving 
requested additional information, if appropriate, and shall notify the 
manufacturer of his decision in writing.
    (b) Surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, 
bioremediation agents, and miscellaneous oil spill control agents. (1) 
To add a surface washing agent, surface collecting agent, bioremediation 
agent, or miscellaneous oil spill control agent to the NCP Product 
Schedule, the technical product data specified in Sec. 300.915 must be 
submitted to the Emergency Response Division (5202-G), U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 
20460. If EPA determines that the required data were submitted, EPA will 
add the product to the Schedule.
    (2) EPA will inform the submitter in writing, within 60 days of the 
receipt of technical product data, of its decision on adding the product 
to the Schedule.
    (c) The submitter may assert that certain information in the 
technical

[[Page 107]]

product data submissions, including technical product data submissions 
for sorbents pursuant to Sec. 300.915(g)(3), is confidential business 
information. EPA will handle such claims pursuant to the provisions in 
40 CFR part 2, subpart B. Such information must be submitted separately 
from non-confidential information, clearly identified, and clearly 
marked ``Confidential Business Information.'' If the submitter fails to 
make such a claim at the time of submittal, EPA may make the information 
available to the public without further notice.
    (d) The submitter must notify EPA of any changes in the composition, 
formulation, or application of the dispersant, surface washing agent, 
surface collecting agent, bioremediation agent, or miscellaneous oil 
spill control agent. On the basis of this data, EPA may require 
retesting of the product if the change is likely to affect the 
effectiveness or toxicity of the product.
    (e) The listing of a product on the NCP Product Schedule does not 
constitute approval of the product. To avoid possible misinterpretation 
or misrepresentation, any label, advertisement, or technical literature 
that refers to the placement of the product on the NCP Product Schedule 
must either reproduce in its entirety EPA's written statement that it 
will add the product to the NCP Product Schedule under 
Sec. 300.920(a)(2) or (b)(2), or include the disclaimer shown below. If 
the disclaimer is used, it must be conspicuous and must be fully 
reproduced. Failure to comply with these restrictions or any other 
improper attempt to demonstrate the approval of the product by any NRT 
or other U.S. Government agency shall constitute grounds for removing 
the product from the NCP Product Schedule.

                                DISCLAIMER

  [PRODUCT NAME] is on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's NCP 
Product Schedule. This listing does NOT mean that EPA approves, 
recommends, licenses, certifies, or authorizes the use of [PRODUCT NAME] 
on an oil discharge. This listing means only that data have been 
submitted to EPA as required by subpart J of the National Contingency 
Plan, Sec. 300.915.

                            1.0  Introduction

    The Hazard Ranking System (HRS) is the principal mechanism the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uses to place sites on the 
National Priorities List

[[Page 112]]

(NPL). The HRS serves as a screening device to evaluate the potential 
for releases of uncontrolled hazardous substances to cause human health 
or environmental damage. The HRS provides a measure of relative rather 
than absolute risk. It is designed so that it can be consistently 
applied to a wide variety of sites.

                            1.1  Definitions

    Acute toxicity: Measure of toxicological responses that result from 
a single exposure to a substance or from multiple exposures within a 
short period of time (typically several days or less). Specific measures 
of acute toxicity used within the HRS include lethal dose<INF>50 
(LD<INF>50) and lethal concentration<INF>50 (LC<INF>50), typically 
measured within a 24-hour to 96-hour period.
    Ambient Aquatic Life Advisory Concentrations (AALACs): EPA's 
advisory concentration limit for acute or chronic toxicity to aquatic 
organisms as established under section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act, 
as amended.
    Ambient Water Quality Criteria (AWQC): EPA's maximum acute or 
chronic toxicity concentrations for protection of aquatic life and its 
uses as established under section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act, as 
amended.
    Bioconcentration factor (BCF): Measure of the tendency for a 
substance to accumulate in the tissue of an aquatic organism. BCF is 
determined by the extent of partitioning of a substance, at equilibrium, 
between the tissue of an aquatic organism and water. As the ratio of 
concentration of a substance in the organism divided by the 
concentration in water, higher BCF values reflect a tendency for 
substances to accumulate in the tissue of aquatic organisms. [unitless].
    Biodegradation: Chemical reaction of a substance induced by 
enzymatic activity of microorganisms.
    CERCLA: Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and 
Liability Act of 1980, as amended (Pub. L. 96-510, as amended).
    Chronic toxicity: Measure of toxicological responses that result 
from repeated exposure to a substance over an extended period of time 
(typically 3 months or longer). Such responses may persist beyond the 
exposure or may not appear until much later in time than the exposure. 
HRS measures of chronic toxicity include Reference Dose (RfD) values.
    Contract Laboratory Program (CLP): Analytical program developed for 
CERCLA waste site samples to fill the need for legally defensible 
analytical results supported by a high level of quality assurance and 
documentation.
    Contract-Required Detection Limit (CRDL): Term equivalent to 
contract-required quantitation limit, but used primarily for inorganic 
substances.
    Contract-Required Quantitation Limit (CRQL): Substance-specific 
level that a CLP laboratory must be able to routinely and reliably 
detect in specific sample matrices. It is not the lowest detectable 
level achievable, but rather the level that a CLP laboratory should 
reasonably quantify. The CRQL may or may not be equal to the 
quantitation limit of a given substance in a given sample. For HRS 
purposes, the term CRQL refers to both the contract-required 
quantitation limit and the contract-required detection limit.
    Curie (Ci): Measure used to quantify the amount of radioactivity. 
One curie equals 37 billion nuclear transformations per second, and one 
picocurie (pCi) equals 10<SUP>-12 Ci.
    Decay product: Isotope formed by the radioactive decay of some other 
isotope. This newly formed isotope possesses physical and chemical 
properties that are different from those of its parent isotope, and may 
also be radioactive.
    Detection Limit (DL): Lowest amount that can be distinguished from 
the normal random ``noise'' of an analytical instrument or method. For 
HRS purposes, the detection limit used is the method detection limit 
(MDL) or, for real-time field instruments, the detection limit of the 
instrument as used in the field.
    Dilution weight: Parameter in the HRS surface water migration 
pathway that reduces the point value assigned to targets as the flow or 
depth of the relevant surface water body increases. [unitless].
    Distance weight: Parameter in the HRS air migration, ground water 
migration, and soil exposure pathways that reduces the point value 
assigned to targets as their distance increases from the site. 
[unitless].
    Distribution coefficient (K<INF>d): Measure of the extent of 
partitioning of a substance between geologic materials (for example, 
soil, sediment, rock) and water (also called partition coefficient). The 
distribution coefficient is used in the HRS in evaluating the mobility 
of a substance for the ground water migration pathway. [ml/g].
    ED<INF>10 (10 percent effective dose): Estimated dose associated 
with a 10 percent increase in response over control groups. For HRS 
purposes, the response considered is cancer. [milligrams toxicant per 
kilogram body weight per day (mg/kg-day)].
    Food and Drug Administration Action Level (FDAAL): Under section 408 
of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, concentration of 
a poisonous or deleterious substance in human food or animal feed at or 
above which FDA will take legal action to remove adulterated products 
from the market. Only FDAALs established for fish and shellfish apply in 
the HRS.
    Half-life: Length of time required for an initial concentration of a 
substance to be halved as a result of loss through decay. The

[[Page 113]]

HRS considers five decay processes: biodegradation, hydrolysis, 
photolysis, radioactive decay, and volatilization.

contaminants as defined in CERCLA sections 101(14) and 101(33), except 
where otherwise specifically noted in the HRS.

substances (as defined in CERCLA section 101[14]) that was deposited, 
stored, disposed, or placed in, or that otherwise migrated to, a source.

migration pathways.
    HRS ``pathway'': Set of HRS factor categories combined to produce a 
score to measure relative risks posed by a site in one of four 
environmental pathways (that is, ground water, surface water, soil, and 
air).
    HRS ``site score'': Composite of the four HRS pathway scores.
    Henry's law constant: Measure of the volatility of a substance in a 
dilute solution of water at equilibrium. It is the ratio of the vapor 
pressure exerted by a substance in the gas phase over a dilute aqueous 
solution of that substance to its concentration in the solution at a 
given temperature. For HRS purposes, use the value reported at or near 
25 deg. C. [atmosphere-cubic meters per mole (atm-m<SUP>3/mol)].
    Hydrolysis: Chemical reaction of a substance with water.
    Karst: Terrain with characteristics of relief and drainage arising 
from a high degree of rock solubility in natural waters. The majority of 
karst occurs in limestones, but karst may also form in dolomite, gypsum, 
and salt deposits. Features associated with karst terrains typically 
include irregular topography, sinkholes, vertical shafts, abrupt ridges, 
caverns, abundant springs, and/or disappearing streams. Karst aquifers 
are associated with karst terrain.
    LC<INF>50 (lethal concentration, 50 percent): Concentration of a 
substance in air [typically micrograms per cubic meter (<greek-m>g/
m<SUP>3)] or water [typically micrograms per liter (<greek-m>g/l)] that 
kills 50 percent of a group of exposed organisms. The LC<INF>50 is used 
in the HRS in assessing acute toxicity.
    LD<INF>50 (lethal dose, 50 percent): Dose of a substance that kills 
50 percent of a group of exposed organisms. The LD<INF>50 is used in the 
HRS in assessing acute toxicity [milligrams toxicant per kilogram body 
weight (mg/kg)].
    Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL): Under section 1412 of the Safe 
Drinking Water Act, as amended, the maximum permissible concentration of 
a substance in water that is delivered to any user of a public water 
supply.
    Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG): Under section 1412 of the 
Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended, a nonenforceable concentration for 
a substance in drinking water that is protective of adverse human health 
effects and allows an adequate margin of safety.
    Method Detection Limit (MDL): Lowest concentration of analyte that a 
method can detect reliably in either a sample or blank.
    Mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances: Material 
containing both radioactive hazardous substances and nonradioactive 
hazardous substances, regardless of whether these types of substances 
are physically separated, combined chemically, or simply mixed together.
    National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS): Primary standards 
for air quality established under sections 108 and 109 of the Clean Air 
Act, as amended.
    National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs): 
Standards established for substances listed under section 112 of the 
Clean Air Act, as amended. Only those NESHAPs promulgated in ambient 
concentration units apply in the HRS.
    Octanol-water partition coefficient (K<INF>ow [or P]): Measure of 
the extent of partitioning of a substance between water and octanol at 
equilibrium. The K<INF>ow is determined by the ratio between the 
concentration in octanol divided by the concentration in water at 
equilibrium. [unitless].
    Organic carbon partition coefficient (K<INF>oc): Measure of the 
extent of partitioning of a substance, at equilibrium, between organic 
carbon in geologic materials and water. The higher the K<INF>oc, the 
more likely a substance is to bind to geologic materials than to remain 
in water. [ml/g].
    Photolysis: Chemical reaction of a substance caused by direct 
absorption of solar energy (direct photolysis) or caused by other 
substances that absorb solar energy (indirect photolysis).
    Radiation: Particles (alpha, beta, neutrons) or photons (x- and 
gamma-rays) emitted by radionuclides.
    Radioactive decay: Process of spontaneous nuclear transformation, 
whereby an isotope of one element is transformed into an isotope of 
another element, releasing excess energy in the form of radiation.
    Radioactive half-life: Time required for one-half the atoms in a 
given quantity of a specific radionuclide to undergo radioactive decay.
    Radioactive substance: Solid, liquid, or gas containing atoms of a 
single radionuclide or multiple radionuclides.
    Radioactivity: Property of those isotopes of elements that exhibit 
radioactive decay and emit radiation.

[[Page 114]]

    Radionuclide/radioisotope: Isotope of an element exhibiting 
radioactivity. For HRS purposes, ``radionuclide'' and ``radioisotope'' 
are used synonymously.
    Reference dose (RfD): Estimate of a daily exposure level of a 
substance to a human population below which adverse noncancer health 
effects are not anticipated. [milligrams toxicant per kilogram body 
weight per day (mg/kg-day)].

site for proper disposal or destruction in a facility permitted under 
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act or the Toxic Substances 
Control Act or by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
    Roentgen (R): Measure of external exposures to ionizing radiation. 
One roentgen equals that amount of x-ray or gamma radiation required to 
produce ions carrying a charge of 1 electrostatic unit (esu) in 1 cubic 
centimeter of dry air under standard conditions. One microroentgen 
(<greek-m>R) equals 10<SUP>-6 R.
    Sample quantitation limit (SQL): Quantity of a substance that can be 
reasonably quantified given the limits of detection for the methods of 
analysis and sample characteristics that may affect quantitation (for 
example, dilution, concentration).
    Screening concentration: Media-specific benchmark concentration for 
a hazardous substance that is used in the HRS for comparison with the 
concentration of that hazardous substance in a sample from that media. 
The screening concentration for a specific hazardous substance 
corresponds to its reference dose for inhalation exposures or for oral 
exposures, as appropriate, and, if the substance is a human carcinogen 
with a weight-of-evidence classification of A, B, or C, to that 
concentration that corresponds to its 10<SUP>-6 individual lifetime 
excess cancer risk for inhalation exposures or for oral exposures, as 
appropriate.
    Site: Area(s) where a hazardous substance has been deposited, 
stored, disposed, or placed, or has otherwise come to be located. Such 
areas may include multiple sources and may include the area between 
sources.
    Slope factor (also referred to as cancer potency factor): Estimate 
of the probability of response (for example, cancer) per unit intake of 
a substance over a lifetime. The slope factor is typically used to 
estimate upper-bound probability of an individual developing cancer as a 
result of exposure to a particular level of a human carcinogen with a 
weight-of-evidence classification of A, B, or C. [(mg/kg-day)<SUP>-1 for 
non-radioactive substances and (pC<INF>i)<SUP>-1 for radioactive 
substances].
    Source: Any area where a hazardous substance has been deposited, 
stored, disposed, or placed, plus those soils that have become 
contaminated from migration of a hazardous substance. Sources do not 
include those volumes of air, ground water, surface water, or surface 
water sediments that have become contaminated by migration, except: in 
the case of either a ground water plume with no identified source or 
contaminated surface water sediments with no identified source, the 
plume or contaminated sediments may be considered a source.
    Target distance limit: Maximum distance over which targets for the 
site are evaluated. The target distance limit varies by HRS pathway.
    Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA) Standards: 
Standards for radionuclides established under sections 102, 104, and 108 
of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act, as amended.
    Vapor pressure: Pressure exerted by the vapor of a substance when it 
is in equilibrium with its solid or liquid form at a given temperature. 
For HRS purposes, use the value reported at or near 25 deg. C. 
[atmosphere or torr].
    Volatilization: Physical transfer process through which a substance 
undergoes a change of state from a solid or liquid to a gas.
    Water solubility: Maximum concentration of a substance in pure water 
at a given temperature. For HRS purposes, use the value reported at or 
near 25 deg. C. [milligrams per liter (mg/l)].
    Weight-of-evidence: EPA classification system for characterizing the 
evidence supporting the designation of a substance as a human 
carcinogen. EPA weight-of-evidence groupings include:

    Group A: Human carcinogen- -sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity 
          in humans.
    Group B1: Probable human carcinogen- -limited evidence of 
          carcinogenicity in humans.
    Group B2: Probable human carcinogen- -sufficient evidence of 
          carcinogenicity in animals.
    Group C: Possible human carcinogen- -limited evidence of 
          carcinogenicity in animals.
    Group D: Not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity- -applicable 
          when there is no animal evidence, or when human or animal 
          evidence is inadequate.
    Group E: Evidence of noncarcinogenicity for humans.

              2.0  Evaluations Common to Multiple Pathways

    2.1  Overview. The HRS site score (S) is the result of an evaluation 
of four pathways:
    <bullet> Ground Water Migration (S<INF>gw).
    <bullet> Surface Water Migration (S<INF>sw).
    <bullet> Soil Exposure (S<INF>s).
    <bullet> Air Migration (S<INF>a).
    The ground water and air migration pathways use single threat 
evaluations, while the surface water migration and soil exposure 
pathways use multiple threat evaluations.

[[Page 115]]

Three threats are evaluated for the surface water migration pathway: 
drinking water, human food chain, and environmental. These threats are 
evaluated for two separate migration components- -overland/flood 
migration and ground water to surface water migration. Two threats are 
evaluated for the soil exposure pathway: resident population and nearby 
population.
    The HRS is structured to provide a parallel evaluation for each of 
these pathways and threats. This section focuses on these parallel 
evaluations, starting with the calculation of the HRS site score and the 
individual pathway scores.
    2.1.1  Calculation of HRS site score. Scores are first calculated 
for the individual pathways as specified in sections 2 through 7 and 
then are combined for the site using the following root-mean-square 
equation to determine the overall HRS site score, which ranges from 0 to 
100:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR31AU93.056

    2.1.2  Calculation of pathway score. Table 2-1, which is based on 
the air migration pathway, illustrates the basic parameters used to 
calculate a pathway score. As Table 2-1 shows, each pathway (or threat) 
score is the product of three ``factor categories'': likelihood of 
release, waste characteristics, and targets. (The soil exposure pathway 
uses likelihood of exposure rather than likelihood of release.) Each of 
the three factor categories contains a set of factors that are assigned 
numerical values and combined as specified in sections 2 through 7. The 
factor values are rounded to the nearest integer, except where otherwise 
noted.
    2.1.3  Common evaluations. Evaluations common to all four HRS 
pathways include:
    <bullet> Characterizing sources.

-Identifying sources (and, for the soil exposure pathway, areas of 
observed contamination [see section 5.0.1]).
-Identifying hazardous substances associated with each source (or area 
of observed contamination).
-Identifying hazardous substances available to a pathway.

-Scoring potential to release when there is no observed release.

    <bullet> Scoring waste characteristics factor category.

-Evaluating toxicity.
-Combining toxicity with mobility, persistence, and/or bioaccumulation 
(or ecosystem bioaccumulation) potential, as appropriate to the pathway 
(or threat).

factors.

    These evaluations are essentially identical for the three migration 
pathways (ground water, surface water, and air). However, the 
evaluations differ in certain respects for the soil exposure pathway.
    Section 7 specifies modifications that apply to each pathway when 
evaluating sites containing radioactive substances.
    Section 2 focuses on evaluations common at the pathway and threat 
levels. Note that

[[Page 116]]

for the ground water and surface water migration pathways, separate 
scores are calculated for each aquifer (see section 3.0) and each 
watershed (see sections 4.1.1.3 and 4.2.1.5) when determining the 
pathway scores for a site. Although the evaluations in section 2 do not 
vary when different aquifers or watersheds are scored at a site, the 
specific factor values (for example, observed release, hazardous waste 
quantity, toxicity/mobility) that result from these evaluations can vary 
by aquifer and by watershed at the site. This can occur through 
differences both in the specific sources and targets eligible to be 
evaluated for each aquifer and watershed and in whether observed 
releases can be established for each aquifer and watershed. Such 
differences in scoring at the aquifer and watershed level are addressed 
in sections 3 and 4, not section 2.
    2.2  Characterize sources. Source characterization includes 
identification of the following:
    <bullet> Sources (and areas of observed contamination) at the site.
    <bullet> Hazardous substances associated with these sources (or 
areas of observed contamination).
    <bullet> Pathways potentially threatened by these hazardous 
substances.
    Table 2-2 presents a sample worksheet for source characterization.
    2.2.1  Identify sources. For the three migration pathways, identify 
the sources at the site that contain hazardous substances. Identify the 
migration pathway(s) to which each source applies. For the soil exposure 
pathway, identify areas of observed contamination at the site (see 
section 5.0.1).

    2.2.2  Identify hazardous substances associated with a source. For 
each of the three migration pathways, consider those hazardous 
substances documented in a source (for example, by sampling, labels, 
manifests, oral or written statements) to be associated with that source 
when evaluating each pathway. In some instances, a hazardous substance 
can be documented as being present at a site (for example, by labels, 
manifests, oral or written statements), but the specific source(s) 
containing that hazardous substance cannot be documented. For the three 
migration pathways, in those instances when the specific source(s) 
cannot be documented for a hazardous substance, consider the hazardous 
substance to be present in each source at the site, except sources for 
which definitive information indicates that the hazardous substance was 
not or could not be present.
    For an area of observed contamination in the soil exposure pathway, 
consider only those hazardous substances that meet the criteria for 
observed contamination for that area (see section 5.0.1) to be 
associated with that area when evaluating the pathway.
    2.2.3  Identify hazardous substances available to a pathway. In 
evaluating each migration pathway, consider the following hazardous 
substances available to migrate from the sources at the site to the 
pathway:
    <bullet> Ground water migration.

-Hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed release 
(see section 2.3) to ground water.

-All hazardous substances associated with a source with a ground water 
containment

[[Page 117]]

factor value greater than 0 (see section 3.1.2.1).

    <bullet> Surface water migration--overland/flood component.

-Hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed release to 
surface water in the watershed being evaluated.
-All hazardous substances associated with a source with a surface water 
containment factor value greater than 0 for the watershed (see sections 
4.1.2.1.2.1.1 and 4.1.2.1.2.2.1).

    <bullet> Surface water migration--ground water to surface water 
component.

-Hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed release to 
ground water.

-All hazardous substances associated with a source with a ground water 
containment factor value greater than 0 (see sections 4.2.2.1.2 and 
3.1.2.1).

    <bullet> Air migration.

-Hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed release to 
the atmosphere.
-All gaseous hazardous substances associated with a source with a gas 
containment factor value greater than 0 (see section 6.1.2.1.1).
-All particulate hazardous substances associated with a source with a 
particulate containment factor value greater than 0 (see section 
6.1.2.2.1).

    <bullet> For each migration pathway, in those instances when the 
specific source(s) containing the hazardous substance cannot be 
documented, consider that hazardous substance to be available to migrate 
to the pathway when it can be associated (see section 2.2.2) with at 
least one source having a containment factor value greater than 0 for 
that pathway.

    In evaluating the soil exposure pathway, consider the following 
hazardous substances available to the pathway:

    <bullet> Soil exposure--resident population threat.

-All hazardous substances that meet the criteria for observed 
contamination at the site (see section 5.0.1).

    <bullet> Soil exposure--nearby population threat.

-All hazardous substances that meet the criteria for observed 
contamination at areas with an attractiveness/accessibility factor value 
greater than 0 (see section 5.2.1.1).

    2.3  Likelihood of release. Likelihood of release is a measure of 
the likelihood that a waste has been or will be released to the 
environment. The likelihood of release factor category is assigned the 
maximum value of 550 for a migration pathway whenever the criteria for 
an observed release are met for that pathway. If the criteria for an 
observed release are met, do not evaluate potential to release for that 
pathway. When the criteria for an observed release are not met, evaluate 
potential to release for that pathway, with a maximum value of 500. The 
evaluation of potential to release varies by migration pathway (see 
sections 3, 4 and 6).
    Establish an observed release either by direct observation of the 
release of a hazardous substance into the media being evaluated (for 
example, surface water) or by chemical analysis of samples appropriate 
to the pathway being evaluated (see sections 3, 4, and 6). The minimum 
standard to establish an observed release by chemical analysis is 
analytical evidence of a hazardous substance in the media significantly 
above the background level. Further, some portion of the release must be 
attributable to the site. Use the criteria in Table 2-3 as the standard 
for determining analytical significance. (The criteria in Table 2-3 are 
also used in establishing observed contamination for the soil exposure 
pathway, see section 5.0.1.) Separate criteria apply to radionuclides 
(see section 7.1.1).


       Table 2-3--Observed Release Criteria for Chemical Analysis       
                                                                        
                                                                        
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sample Measurement  Sample Quantitation Limit <SUP>a                         
An observed release is established as follows:                          
  <bullet> If the background concentration is not detected (or is less  
   than the detection limit), an observed release is established when   
   the sample measurement equals or exceeds the sample quantitation     
   limit.<SUP>a                                                              
  <bullet> If the background concentration equals or exceeds the        
   detection limit, an observed release is established when the sample  
   measurement is 3 times or more above the background concentration.   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
<SUP>a If the sample quantitation limit (SQL) cannot be established,         
  determine if there is an observed release as follows:                 
  --If the sample analysis was performed under the EPA Contract         
  Laboratory Program, use the EPA contract-required quantitation limit  
  (CRQL) in place of the SQL.                                           
  --If the sample analysis is not performed under the EPA Contract      
  Laboratory Program, use the detection limit (DL) in place of the SQL. 


    2.4  Waste characteristics. The waste characteristics factor 
category includes the following factors: hazardous waste quantity, 
toxicity, and as appropriate to the pathway or threat being evaluated, 
mobility, persistence, and/or bioaccumulation (or ecosystem 
bioaccumulation) potential.
    2.4.1  Selection of substance potentially posing greatest hazard. 
For all pathways (and threats), select the hazardous substance 
potentially posing the greatest hazard for the pathway (or threat) and 
use that substance in evaluating the waste characteristics category of 
the pathway (or threat). For the three migration pathways (and threats), 
base the selection of this hazardous substance on the toxicity factor 
value for the substance, combined with its mobility, persistence, and/

[[Page 118]]

or bioaccumulation (or ecosystem bioaccumulation) potential factor 
values, as applicable to the migration pathway (or threat). For the soil 
exposure pathway, base the selection on the toxicity factor alone.
     Evaluation of the toxicity factor is specified in section 2.4.1.1. 
Use and evaluation of the mobility, persistence, and/or bioaccumulation 
(or ecosystem bioaccumulation) potential factors vary by pathway (or 
threat) and are specified under the appropriate pathway (or threat) 
section. Section 2.4.1.2 identifies the specific factors that are 
combined with toxicity in evaluating each pathway (or threat).
    2.4.1.1  Toxicity factor. Evaluate toxicity for those hazardous 
substances at the site that are available to the pathway being scored. 
For all pathways and threats, except the surface water environmental 
threat, evaluate human toxicity as specified below. For the surface 
water environmental threat, evaluate ecosystem toxicity as specified in 
section 4.1.4.2.1.1.
     Establish human toxicity factor values based on quantitative dose-
response parameters for the following three types of toxicity:
    <bullet> Cancer- -Use slope factors (also referred to as cancer 
potency factors) combined with weight-of-evidence ratings for 
carcinogenicity. If a slope factor is not available for a substance, use 
its ED<INF>10 value to estimate a slope factor as follows:

                                                                                                                
                                                                         1                                      
                                                  Slope factor   = ------------                                 
                                                                     6 (ED<INF>10)                                   
                                                                                                                

    <bullet> Noncancer toxicological responses of chronic exposure- -use 
reference dose (RfD) values.
    <bullet> Noncancer toxicological responses of acute exposure- -use 
acute toxicity parameters, such as the LD<INF>50.
    Assign human toxicity factor values to a hazardous substance using 
Table 2-4, as follows:
    <bullet> If RfD and slope factor values are both available for the 
hazardous substance, assign the substance a value from Table 2-4 for 
each. Select the higher of the two values assigned and use it as the 
overall toxicity factor value for the hazardous substance.
    <bullet> If either an RfD or slope factor value is available, but 
not both, assign the hazardous substance an overall toxicity factor 
value from Table 2-4 based solely on the available value (RfD or slope 
factor).
    <bullet> If neither an RfD nor slope factor value is available, 
assign the hazardous substance an overall toxicity factor value from 
Table 2-4 based solely on acute toxicity. That is, consider acute 
toxicity in Table 2-4 only when both RfD and slope factor values are not 
available.
    <bullet> If neither an RfD, nor slope factor, nor acute toxicity 
value is available, assign the hazardous substance an overall toxicity 
factor value of 0 and use other hazardous substances for which 
information is available in evaluating the pathway.

    If a toxicity factor value of 0 is assigned to all hazardous 
substances available to a particular pathway (that is, insufficient 
toxicity data are available for evaluating all the substances), use a 
default value of 100 as the overall human toxicity factor value for all 
hazardous substances available to the pathway. For hazardous substances 
having usable toxicity data for multiple exposure routes (for example, 
inhalation and ingestion), consider all exposure routes and use the 
highest assigned value, regardless of exposure route, as the toxicity 
factor value.
    For HRS purposes, assign both asbestos and lead (and its compounds) 
a human toxicity factor value of 10,000.
    Separate criteria apply for assigning factor values for human 
toxicity and ecosystem toxicity for radionuclides (see sections 7.2.1 
and 7.2.2).
    2.4.1.2  Hazardous substance selection. For each hazardous substance 
evaluated for a migration pathway (or threat), combine the human 
toxicity factor value (or ecosystem toxicity factor value) for the 
hazardous substance with a mobility, persistence, and/or bioaccumulation 
(or ecosystem bioaccumulation) potential factor value as follows:
    <bullet> Ground water migration.

-Determine a combined human toxicity/mobility factor value for the 
hazardous substance (see section 3.2.1).

    <bullet> Surface water migration-overland/flood migration component.

-Determine a combined human toxicity/persistence factor value for the 
hazardous substance for the drinking water threat (see section 
4.1.2.2.1).
-Determine a combined human toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor 
value for the hazardous substance for the human food chain threat (see 
section 4.1.3.2.1).
-Determine a combined ecosystem toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation 
factor value for the hazardous substance for the environmental threat 
(see section 4.1.4.2.1).

    <bullet> Surface water migration-ground water to surface water 
migration component.

-Determine a combined human toxicity/mobility/persistence factor value 
for the hazardous substance for the drinking water threat (see section 
4.2.2.2.1).
-Determine a combined human toxicity/mobility/persistence/
bioaccumulation factor value for the hazardous substance for the human 
food chain threat (see section 4.2.3.2.1).
-Determine a combined ecosystem toxicity/mobility/persistence/
bioaccumulation factor value for the hazardous substance for the 
environmental threat (see section 4.2.4.2.1).

    <bullet> Air migration.

-Determine a combined human toxicity/mobility factor value for the 
hazardous substance (see section 6.2.1).

    Determine each combined factor value for a hazardous substance by 
multiplying the individual factor values appropriate to the pathway (or 
threat). For each migration pathway (or threat) being evaluated, select 
the hazardous substance with the highest combined factor value and use 
that substance in evaluating the waste characteristics factor category 
of the pathway (or threat).
    For the soil exposure pathway, select the hazardous substance with 
the highest human toxicity factor value from among the substances that 
meet the criteria for observed contamination for the threat evaluated 
and use that substance in evaluating the waste characteristics factor 
category.
    2.4.2  Hazardous waste quantity. Evaluate the hazardous waste 
quantity factor by first assigning each source (or area of observed 
contamination) a source hazardous waste quantity value as specified 
below. Sum these values to obtain the hazardous waste quantity factor 
value for the pathway being evaluated.
    In evaluating the hazardous waste quantity factor for the three 
migration pathways, allocate hazardous substances and hazardous 
wastestreams to specific sources in the manner specified in section 
2.2.2, except: consider hazardous substances and hazardous wastestreams 
that cannot be allocated to any specific source to constitute a separate 
``unallocated source'' for purposes of evaluating only this factor for 
the three migration pathways. Do not, however, include a hazardous 
substance or hazardous wastestream in the unallocated source for a 
migration pathway if there is definitive information indicating that the 
substance or wastestream could only have been placed in sources with a 
containment factor value of 0 for that migration pathway.
    In evaluating the hazardous waste quantity factor for the soil 
exposure pathway, allocate to each area of observed contamination only 
those hazardous substances that meet the criteria for observed 
contamination for that area of observed contamination and only those 
hazardous wastestreams that contain hazardous substances that meet the 
criteria for observed contamination for that area of observed 
contamination. Do not consider other hazardous substances or hazardous 
wastestreams at the site in evaluating this factor for the soil exposure 
pathway.
    2.4.2.1  Source hazardous waste quantity. For each of the three 
migration pathways, assign a source hazardous waste quantity value to 
each source (including the unallocated source) having a containment 
factor value greater than 0 for the pathway being evaluated. Consider 
the unallocated

[[Page 120]]

source to have a containment factor value greater than 0 for each 
migration pathway.
    For the soil exposure pathway, assign a source hazardous waste 
quantity value to each area of observed contamination, as applicable to 
the threat being evaluated.
    For all pathways, evaluate source hazardous waste quantity using the 
following four measures in the following hierarchy:
    <bullet> Hazardous constituent quantity.
    <bullet> Hazardous wastestream quantity.
    <bullet> Volume.
    <bullet> Area.

    For the unallocated source, use only the first two measures.
    Separate criteria apply for assigning a source hazardous waste 
quantity value for radionuclides (see section 7.2.5).
    2.4.2.1.1  Hazardous constituent quantity. Evaluate hazardous 
constituent quantity for the source (or area of observed contamination) 
based solely on the mass of CERCLA hazardous substances (as defined in 
CERCLA section 101(14), as amended) allocated to the source (or area of 
observed contamination), except:
    <bullet> For a hazardous waste listed pursuant to section 3001 of 
the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation 
and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq., determine its 
mass for the evaluation of this measure as follows:

-If the hazardous waste is listed solely for Hazard Code T (toxic 
waste), include only the mass of constituents in the hazardous waste 
that are CERCLA hazardous substances and not the mass of the entire 
hazardous waste.
-If the hazardous waste is listed for any other Hazard Code (including T 
plus any other Hazard Code), include the mass of the entire hazardous 
waste.

    <bullet> For a RCRA hazardous waste that exhibits the 
characteristics identified under section 3001 of RCRA, as amended, 
determine its mass for the evaluation of this measure as follows:

-If the hazardous waste exhibits only the characteristic of toxicity (or 
only the characteristic of EP toxicity), include only the mass of 
constituents in the hazardous waste that are CERCLA hazardous substances 
and not the mass of the entire hazardous waste.
-If the hazardous waste exhibits any other characteristic identified 
under section 3001 (including any other characteristic plus the 
characteristic of toxicity [or the characteristic of EP toxicity]), 
include the mass of the entire hazardous waste.

    Based on this mass, designated as C, assign a value for hazardous 
constituent quantity as follows:
    <bullet> For the migration pathways, assign the source a value for 
hazardous constituent quantity using the Tier A equation of Table 2-5.
    <bullet> For the soil exposure pathway, assign the area of observed 
contamination a value using the Tier A equation of Table 5-2 (section 
5.1.2.2).

    If the hazardous constituent quantity for the source (or area of 
observed contamination) is adequately determined (that is, the total 
mass of all CERCLA hazardous substances in the source and releases from 
the source [or in the area of observed contamination] is known or is 
estimated with reasonable confidence), do not evaluate the other three 
measures discussed below. Instead assign these other three measures a 
value of 0 for the source (or area of observed contamination) and 
proceed to section 2.4.2.1.5.
    If the hazardous constituent quantity is not adequately determined, 
assign the source (or area of observed contamination) a value for 
hazardous constituent quantity based on the available data and proceed 
to section 2.4.2.1.2.

    2.4.2.1.2  Hazardous wastestream quantity. Evaluate hazardous

based on the mass of hazardous

[[Page 121]]

wastestreams plus the mass of any additional CERCLA pollutants and 
contaminants (as defined in CERCLA section 101[33], as amended) that are 
allocated to the source (or area of observed contamination). For a 
wastestream that consists solely of a hazardous waste listed pursuant to 
section 3001 of RCRA, as amended or that consists solely of a RCRA 
hazardous waste that exhibits the characteristics identified under 
section 3001 of RCRA, as amended, include the mass of that entire 
hazardous waste in the evaluation of this measure.
    Based on this mass, designated as W, assign a value for hazardous 
wastestream quantity as follows:
    <bullet> For the migration pathways, assign the source a value for 
hazardous wastestream quantity using the Tier B equation of Table 2-5.
    <bullet> For the soil exposure pathway, assign the area of observed 
contamination a value using the Tier B equation of Table 5-2 (section 
5.1.2.2).
    Do not evaluate the volume and area measures described below if the 
source is the unallocated source or if the following condition applies:
    <bullet> The hazardous wastestream quantity for the source (or area 
of observed contamination) is adequately determined--that is, total mass 
of all hazardous wastestreams and CERCLA pollutants and contaminants for 
the source and releases from the source (or for the area of observed 
contamination) is known or is estimated with reasonable confidence.

    If the source is the unallocated source or if this condition 
applies, assign the volume and area measures a value of 0 for the source 
(or area of observed contamination) and proceed to section 2.4.2.1.5. 
Otherwise, assign the source (or area of observed contamination) a value 
for hazardous wastestream quantity based on the available data and 
proceed to section 2.4.2.1.3.
    2.4.2.1.3  Volume. Evaluate the volume measure using the volume of 
the source (or the volume of the area of observed contamination). For 
the soil exposure pathway, restrict the use of the volume measure to 
those areas of observed contamination specified in section 5.1.2.2.
    Based on the volume, designated as V, assign a value to the volume 
measure as follows:
    <bullet> For the migration pathways, assign the source a value for 
volume using the appropriate Tier C equation of Table 2-5.
    <bullet> For the soil exposure pathway, assign the area of observed 
contamination a value for volume using the appropriate Tier C equation 
of Table 5-2 (section 5.1.2.2).

    If the volume of the source (or volume of the area of observed 
contamination, if applicable) can be determined, do not evaluate the 
area measure. Instead, assign the area measure a value of 0 and proceed 
to section 2.4.2.1.5. If the volume cannot be determined (or is not 
applicable for the soil exposure pathway), assign the source (or area of 
observed contamination) a value of 0 for the volume measure and proceed 
to section 2.4.2.1.4.
    2.4.2.1.4  Area. Evaluate the area measure using the area of the 
source (or the area of the area of observed contamination). Based on 
this area, designated as A, assign a value to the area measure as 
follows:
    <bullet> For the migration pathways, assign the source a value for 
area using the appropriate Tier D equation of Table 2-5.
    <bullet> For the soil exposure pathway, assign the area of observed 
contamination a value for area using the appropriate Tier D equation of 
Table 5-2 (section 5.1.2.2).
    2.4.2.1.5  Calculation of source hazardous waste quantity value. 
Select the highest of the values assigned to the source (or area of 
observed contamination) for the hazardous constituent quantity, 
hazardous wastestream quantity, volume, and area measures. Assign this 
value as the source hazardous waste quantity value. Do not round to the 
nearest integer.
    2.4.2.2  Calculation of hazardous waste quantity factor value. Sum 
the source hazardous waste quantity values assigned to all sources 
(including the unallocated source) or areas of observed contamination 
for the pathway being evaluated and round this sum to the nearest 
integer, except: if the sum is greater than 0, but less than 1, round it 
to 1. Based on this value, select a hazardous waste quantity factor 
value for the pathway from Table 2-6.

<SUP>b For the pathway, if hazardous constituent quantity is not adequately  
  determined, assign a value as specified in the text; do not assign the

    For a migration pathway, if the hazardous constituent quantity is 
adequately determined (see section 2.4.2.1.1) for all sources (or all 
portions of sources and releases remaining after a removal action), 
assign the value from Table 2-6 as the hazardous waste quantity factor 
value for the pathway. If the hazardous constituent quantity is not 
adequately determined for one or more sources

[[Page 122]]

(or one or more portions of sources or releases remaining after a 
removal action) assign a factor value as follows:
    <bullet> If any target for that migration pathway is subject to 
Level I or Level II concentrations (see section 2.5), assign either the 
value from Table 2-6 or a value of 100, whichever is greater, as the 
hazardous waste quantity factor value for that pathway.
    <bullet> If none of the targets for that pathway is subject to Level 
I or Level II concentrations, assign a factor value as follows:

-If there has been no removal action, assign either the value from Table 
2-6 or a value of 10, whichever is greater, as the hazardous waste 
quantity factor value for that pathway.

-If there has been a removal action:
      -Determine values from Table 2-6 with and without consideration of 
the removal action.
      -If the value that would be assigned from Table 2-6 without 
consideration of the removal action would be 100 or greater, assign 
either the value from Table 2-6 with consideration of the removal action 
or a value of 100, whichever is greater, as the hazardous waste quantity 
factor value for the pathway.
      -If the value that would be assigned from Table 2-6 without 
consideration of the removal action would be less than 100, assign a 
value of 10 as the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the 
pathway.

    For the soil exposure pathway, if the hazardous constituent quantity 
is adequately determined for all areas of observed contamination, assign 
the value from Table 2-6 as the hazardous waste quantity factor value. 
If the hazardous constituent quantity is not adequately determined for 
one or more areas of observed contamination, assign either the value 
from Table 2-6 or a value of 10, whichever is greater, as the hazardous 
waste quantity factor value.
    2.4.3  Waste characteristics factor category value. Determine the 
waste characteristics factor category value as specified in section 
2.4.3.1 for all pathways and threats, except the surface water-human 
food chain threat and the surface water-environmental threat. Determine 
the waste characteristics factor category value for these latter two 
threats as specified in section 2.4.3.2.
    2.4.3.1  Factor category value. For the pathway (or threat) being 
evaluated, multiply the toxicity or combined factor value, as 
appropriate, from section 2.4.1.2 and the hazardous waste quantity 
factor value from section 2.4.2.2, subject to a maximum product of 
1 x 10\8\. Based on this waste characteristics product, assign a waste 
characteristics factor category value to the pathway (or threat) from 
Table 2-7.

    2.4.3.2  Factor category value, considering bioaccumulation 
potential. For the surface water-human food chain threat and the surface 
water-environmental threat, multiply the toxicity or combined factor 
value, as appropriate, from section 2.4.1.2 and the hazardous waste 
quantity factor value from section 2.4.2.2, subject to:
    <bullet> A maximum product of 1 x 10\12\, and
    <bullet> A maximum product exclusive of the bioaccumulation (or 
ecosystem bioaccumulation) potential factor of 1 x 10\8\.
    Based on the total waste characteristics product, assign a waste 
characteristics factor category value to these threats from Table 2-7.
    2.5  Targets.
    The types of targets evaluated include the following:
    <bullet> Individual (factor name varies by pathway and threat).
    <bullet> Human population.
    <bullet> Resources (these vary by pathway and threat).
    <bullet> Sensitive environments (included for all pathways except 
ground water migration).
    The factor values that may be assigned to each type of target have 
the same range for each pathway for which that type of target is 
evaluated. The factor value for most types of targets depends on whether 
the target is subject to actual or potential contamination for the 
pathway and whether the actual contamination is Level I or Level II:
    <bullet> Actual contamination: Target is associated either with a 
sampling location that meets the criteria for an observed release (or 
observed contamination) for the pathway or with an observed release 
based on direct observation for the pathway (additional criteria apply 
for establishing actual contamination for the human food chain threat in 
the surface water migration pathway, see sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3). 
sections 3 through 6 specify how to determine the targets associated 
with a sampling location or with an observed release based on direct 
observation.

[[Page 123]]

Determine whether the actual contamination is Level I or Level II as 
follows:
-Level I:
      -Media-specific concentrations for the target meet the criteria 
for an observed release (or observed contamination) for the pathway and 
are at or above media-specific benchmark values. These benchmark values 
(see section 2.5.2) include both screening concentrations and 
concentrations specified in regulatory limits (such as Maximum 
Contaminant Level (MCL) values), or
      -For the human food chain threat in the surface water migration 
pathway, concentrations in tissue samples from aquatic human food chain 
organisms are at or above benchmark values. Such tissue samples may be 
used in addition to media-specific concentrations only as specified in 
sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3.
-Level II:
      -Media-specific concentrations for the target meet the criteria 
for an observed release (or observed contamination) for the pathway, but 
are less than media-specific benchmarks. If none of the hazardous 
substances eligible to be evaluated for the sampling location has an 
applicable benchmark, assign Level II to the actual contamination at the 
sampling location, or
      -For observed releases based on direct observation, assign Level 
II to targets as specified in sections 3, 4, and 6, or
      -For the human food chain threat in the surface water migration 
pathway, concentrations in tissue samples from aquatic human food chain 
organisms, when applicable, are below benchmark values.
-If a target is subject to both Level I and Level II concentrations for 
a pathway (or threat), evaluate the target using Level I concentrations 
for that pathway (or threat).

    <bullet> Potential contamination: Target is subject to a potential 
release (that is, target is not associated with actual contamination for 
that pathway or threat).
    Assign a factor value for individual risk as follows (select the 
highest value that applies to the pathway or threat):
    <bullet> 50 points if any individual is exposed to Level I 
concentrations.
    <bullet> 45 points if any individual is exposed to Level II 
concentrations.
    <bullet> Maximum of 20 points if any individual is subject to 
potential contamination. The value assigned is 20 multiplied by the 
distance or dilution weight appropriate to the pathway.
    Assign factor values for population and sensitive environments as 
follows:
    <bullet> Sum Level I targets and multiply by 10. (Level I is not 
used for sensitive environments in the soil exposure and air migration 
pathways.)
    <bullet> Sum Level II targets.
    <bullet> Multiply potential targets by distance or dilution weights 
appropriate to the pathway, sum, and divide by 10. Distance or dilution 
weighting accounts for diminishing exposure with increasing distance or 
dilution within the different pathways.
    <bullet> Sum the values for the three levels.
    In addition, resource value points are assigned within all pathways 
for welfare-related impacts (for example, impacts to agricultural land), 
but do not depend on whether there is actual or potential contamination.
    2.5.1  Determination of level of actual contamination at a sampling 
location. Determine whether Level I concentrations or Level II 
concentrations apply at a sampling location (and thus to the associated 
targets) as follows:
    <bullet> Select the benchmarks applicable to the pathway (or threat) 
being evaluated.
    <bullet> Compare the concentrations of hazardous substances in the 
sample (or comparable samples) to their benchmark concentrations for the 
pathway (or threat), as specified in section 2.5.2.
    <bullet> Determine which level applies based on this comparison.
    <bullet> If none of the hazardous substances eligible to be 
evaluated for the sampling location has an applicable benchmark, assign 
Level II to the actual contamination at that sampling location for the 
pathway (or threat).

    In making the comparison, consider only those samples, and only 
those hazardous substances in the sample, that meet the criteria for an 
observed release (or observed contamination) for the pathway, except: 
tissue samples from aquatic human food chain organisms may also be used 
as specified in sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3 of the surface water-human 
food chain threat. If any hazardous substance is present in more than 
one comparable sample for the sampling location, use the highest 
concentration of that hazardous substance from any of the comparable 
samples in making the comparisons.
    Treat sets of samples that are not comparable separately and make a 
separate comparison for each such set.
    2.5.2  Comparison to benchmarks. Use the following media-specific 
benchmarks for making the comparisons for the indicated pathway (or 
threat):
    <bullet> Maximum Contaminant Level Goals (MCLGs)--ground water 
migration pathway and drinking water threat in surface water migration 
pathway. Use only MCLG values greater than 0.
    <bullet> Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs)--ground water migration 
pathway and drinking water threat in surface water migration pathway.
    <bullet> Food and Drug Administration Action Level (FDAAL) for fish 
or shellfish--human

[[Page 124]]

food chain threat in surface water migration pathway.
    <bullet> EPA Ambient Water Quality Criteria (AWQC) for protection of 
aquatic life--environmental threat in surface water migration pathway.
    <bullet> EPA Ambient Aquatic Life Advisory Concentrations (AALAC)--
environmental threat in surface water migration pathway.
    <bullet> National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)--air 
migration pathway.
    <bullet> National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants 
(NESHAPs)--air migration pathway. Use only those NESHAPs promulgated in 
ambient concentration units.
    <bullet> Screening concentration for cancer corresponding to that 
concentration that corresponds to the 10<SUP>-6 individual cancer risk 
for inhalation exposures (air migration pathway) or for oral exposures 
(ground water migration pathway; drinking water and human food chain 
threats in surface water migration pathway; and soil exposure pathway).
    <bullet> Screening concentration for noncancer toxicological 
responses corresponding to the RfD for inhalation exposures (air 
migration pathway) or for oral exposures (ground water migration 
pathway; drinking water and human food chain threats in surface water 
migration pathway; and soil exposure pathway).

    Select the benchmark(s) applicable to the pathway (or threat) being 
evaluated as specified in sections 3 through 6. Compare the 
concentration of each hazardous substance from the sampling location to 
its benchmark concentration(s) for that pathway (or threat). Use only 
those samples and only those hazardous substances in the sample that 
meet the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination) 
for the pathway, except: tissue samples from aquatic human food chain 
organisms may be used as specified in sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3. If 
the concentration of any applicable hazardous substance from any sample 
equals or exceeds its benchmark concentration, consider the sampling 
location to be subject to Level I concentrations for that pathway (or 
threat). If more than one benchmark applies to the hazardous substance, 
assign Level I if the concentration of the hazardous substance equals or 
exceeds the lowest applicable benchmark concentration.
    If no hazardous substance individually equals or exceeds its 
benchmark concentration, but more than one hazardous substance either 
meets the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination) 
for the sample (or comparable samples) or is eligible to be evaluated 
for a tissue sample (see sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3), calculate the 
indices I and J specified below based on these hazardous substances.
    For those hazardous substances that are carcinogens (that is, those 
having a carcinogen weight-of-evidence classification of A, B, or C), 
calculate an index I for the sample location as follows:

  ...............   n                      C<INF>i                           
I =..............   <greek-S>             --                            
  ...............  i=1                    SC<INF>i                           
                                                                        

where:

C<INF>i=Concentration of hazardous substance i in sample (or highest 
          concentration of hazardous substance i from among comparable 
          samples).
 SC<INF>i=Screening concentration for cancer corresponding to that 
          concentration that corresponds to its 10<SUP>-6 individual 
          cancer risk for applicable exposure (inhalation or oral) for 
          hazardous substance i.
n=Number of applicable hazardous substances in sample (or comparable 
          samples) that are carcinogens and for which an SC<INF>i is 
          available.

    For those hazardous substances for which an RfD is available, 
calculate an index J for the sample location as follows:

  ...............   m                      C<INF>j                           
I =..............   <greek-S>             --                            
  ...............  j=1                    CR<INF>j                           
                                                                        

 where:
 C<INF>j=Concentration of hazardous substance j in sample (or highest 
          concentration of hazardous substance j from among comparable 
          samples).
 CR<INF>j=Screening concentration for noncancer toxicological responses 
          corresponding to RfD for applicable exposure (inhalation or 
          oral) for hazardous substance j.
 m=Number of applicable hazardous substances in sample (or comparable 
          samples) for which a CR<INF>j is available.

    If either I or J equals or exceeds 1, consider the sampling location 
to be subject to Level I concentrations for that pathway (or threat). If 
both I and J are less than 1, consider the sampling location to be 
subject to Level II concentrations for that pathway (or threat). If, for 
the sampling location, there are sets of samples that are not 
comparable, calculate I and J separately for each such set, and use the 
highest calculated values of I and J to assign Level I and Level II.
    See sections 7.3.1 and 7.3.2 for criteria for determining the level 
of contamination for radioactive substances.

                   3.0  Ground Water Migration Pathway

    Evaluate the ground water migration pathway based on three factor 
categories: likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets. 
Figure 3-1 indicates the factors included within each factor category.
    Determine the ground water migration pathway score (S<INF>gw) in 
terms of the factor category values as follows:

[[Page 125]]

                               S<INF>gw=  -------------------                
                                              SF                        
                                                                        

where:

LR=Likelihood of release factor category value.
WC=Waste characteristics factor category value.
T=Targets factor category value.
SF=Scaling factor.

    Table 3-1 outlines the specific calculation procedure.
    Calculate a separate ground water migration pathway score for each 
aquifer, using the factor category values for that aquifer for 
likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets. In doing so, 
include both the targets using water from that aquifer and the targets 
using water from all overlying aquifers through which the hazardous 
substances would migrate to reach the aquifer being evaluated. Assign 
the highest ground water migration pathway score that results for any 
aquifer as the ground water migration pathway score for the site.

    3.0.1  General considerations
    3.0.1.1  Ground water target distance limit. The target distance 
limit defines the maximum distance from the sources at the site over 
which targets are evaluated. Use a target distance limit of 4 miles for 
the ground water migration pathway, except when aquifer discontinuities 
apply (see section 3.0.1.2.2). Furthermore, consider any well with an 
observed release from a source at the site (see section 3.1.1) to lie 
within the target distance limit of the site, regardless of the well's 
distance from the sources at the site.
    For sites that consist solely of a contaminated ground water plume 
with no identified source, begin measuring the 4-mile target distance 
limit at the center of the area of observed ground water contamination. 
Determine the area of observed ground water contamination based on 
available samples that meet the criteria for an observed release.
    3.0.1.2  Aquifer boundaries. Combine multiple aquifers into a single 
hydrologic unit for scoring purposes if aquifer interconnections can be 
established for these aquifers. In contrast, restrict aquifer boundaries 
if aquifer discontinuities can be established.
    3.0.1.2.1  Aquifer interconnections. Evaluate whether aquifer 
interconnections occur within 2 miles of the sources at the site. If 
they occur within this 2-mile distance, combine the aquifers having 
interconnections in scoring the site. In addition, if observed ground 
water contamination attributable to the sources at the site extends 
beyond 2 miles from the sources, use any locations within the limits of 
this observed ground water contamination in evaluating aquifer 
interconnections. If data are not adequate to establish aquifer 
interconnections, evaluate the aquifers as separate aquifers.
     3.0.1.2.2  Aquifer discontinuities. Evaluate whether aquifer 
discontinuities occur within the 4-mile target distance limit. An 
aquifer discontinuity occurs for scoring purposes only when a geologic, 
topographic, or other structure or feature entirely transects an aquifer 
within the 4-mile target distance limit, thereby creating a continuous 
boundary to ground water flow within this limit. If two or more aquifers 
can be combined into a single hydrologic unit for scoring purposes, an 
aquifer discontinuity occurs only when the structure or feature entirely 
transects the boundaries of this single hydrologic unit.
    When an aquifer discontinuity is established within the 4-mile 
target distance limit, exclude that portion of the aquifer beyond the 
discontinuity in evaluating the ground water migration pathway. However, 
if hazardous substances have migrated across an apparent discontinuity 
within the 4-mile target distance limit, do not consider this to be a 
discontinuity in scoring the site.
    3.0.1.3   Karst aquifer. Give a karst aquifer that underlies any 
portion of the sources at

[[Page 128]]

the site special consideration in the evaluation of two potential to 
release factors (depth to aquifer in section 3.1.2.3 and travel time in 
section 3.1.2.4), one waste characteristics factor (mobility in section 
3.2.1.2), and two targets factors (nearest well in section 3.3.1 and 
potential contamination in section 3.3.2.4).
    3.1  Likelihood of release. For an aquifer, evaluate the likelihood 
of release factor category in terms of an observed release factor or a 
potential to release factor.
    3.1.1  Observed release. Establish an observed release to an aquifer 
by demonstrating that the site has released a hazardous substance to the 
aquifer. Base this demonstration on either:
    <bullet> Direct observation--a material that contains one or more 
hazardous substances has been deposited into or has been observed 
entering the aquifer.
    <bullet> Chemical analysis--an analysis of ground water samples from 
the aquifer indicates that the concentration of hazardous substance(s) 
has increased significantly above the background concentration for the 
site (see section 2.3). Some portion of the significant increase must be 
attributable to the site to establish the observed release, except: when 
the source itself consists of a ground water plume with no identified 
source, no separate attribution is required.

    If an observed release can be established for the aquifer, assign 
the aquifer an observed release factor value of 550, enter this value in 
Table 3-1, and proceed to section 3.1.3. If an observed release cannot 
be established for the aquifer, assign an observed release factor value 
of 0, enter this value in Table 3-1, and proceed to section 3.1.2.
    3.1.2  Potential to release. Evaluate potential to release only if 
an observed release cannot be established for the aquifer. Evaluate 
potential to release based on four factors: containment, net 
precipitation, depth to aquifer, and travel time. For sources overlying 
karst terrain, give any karst aquifer that underlies any portion of the 
sources at the site special consideration in evaluating depth to aquifer 
and travel time, as specified in sections 3.1.2.3 and 3.1.2.4.
    3.1.2.1  Containment. Assign a containment factor value from Table 
3-2 to each source at the site. Select the highest containment factor 
value assigned to those sources with a source hazardous waste quantity 
value of 0.5 or more (see section 2.4.2.1.5). (Do not include this 
minimum size requirement in evaluating any other factor of this 
pathway.) Assign this highest value as the containment factor value for 
the aquifer being evaluated. Enter this value in Table 3-1.
    If no source at the site meets the minimum size requirement, then 
select the highest value assigned to the sources at the site and assign 
it as the containment factor value for the aquifer being evaluated. 
Enter this value in Table 3-1.
    3.1.2.2  Net precipitation. Assign a net precipitation factor value 
to the site. Figure 3-2 provides computed net precipitation factor 
values, based on site location. Where necessary, determine the net 
precipitation factor value as follows:
    <bullet> Determine monthly precipitation and monthly 
evapotranspiration:
-Use local measured monthly averages.
-When local data are not available, use monthly averages from the 
nearest National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration weather 
station that is in a similar geographic setting.

    3.1.2.3   Depth to aquifer. Evaluate depth to aquifer by determining 
the depth from the lowest known point of hazardous substances at a site 
to the top of the aquifer being evaluated, considering all layers in 
that interval. Measure the depth to an aquifer as the distance from the 
surface to the top of the aquifer minus the distance from the surface to 
the lowest known point of hazardous substances eligible to be evaluated 
for that aquifer. In evaluating depth to aquifer in karst terrain, 
assign a thickness of 0 feet to a karst aquifer that underlies any 
portion of the sources at the site. Based on the calculated depth, 
assign a value from Table 3-5 to the depth to aquifer factor.
    Determine the depth to aquifer only at locations within 2 miles of 
the sources at the site, except: if observed ground water contamination 
attributable to sources at the site extends more than 2 miles beyond 
these sources, use any location within the limits of this observed 
ground water contamination when evaluating the depth to aquifer factor 
for any aquifer that does not have an observed release. If the necessary 
geologic information is available at multiple locations, calculate the 
depth to aquifer at each location. Use the location having the smallest 
depth to assign the factor value. Enter this value in Table 3-1.

    3.1.2.4  Travel time. Evaluate the travel time factor based on the 
geologic materials in the interval between the lowest known

point of hazardous substances at the site and the top of the aquifer 
being evaluated. Assign a value to the travel time factor as follows:
    <bullet> If the depth to aquifer (see section 3.1.2.3) is 10 feet or 
less, assign a value of 35.
    <bullet> If, for the interval being evaluated, all layers that 
underlie a portion of the sources at the site are karst, assign a value 
of 35.
    <bullet> Otherwise:

-Select the lowest hydraulic conductivity layer(s) from within the above 
interval. Consider only layers at least 3 feet thick. However, do not 
consider layers or portions of layers within the first 10 feet of the 
depth to the aquifer.
-Determine hydraulic conductivities for individual layers from Table 3-6 
or from in-situ or laboratory tests. Use representative, measured, 
hydraulic conductivity values whenever available.
-If more than one layer has the same lowest hydraulic conductivity, 
include all such layers and sum their thicknesses. Assign a thickness of 
0 feet to a karst layer that underlies any portion of the sources at the 
site.
-Assign a value from Table 3-7 to the travel time factor, based on the 
thickness and hydraulic conductivity of the lowest hydraulic 
conductivity layer(s).

these sources, use any location within the limits of this observed 
ground water contamination when evaluating the travel time factor for 
any aquifer that does not have an observed release. If the necessary 
subsurface geologic information is available at multiple locations, 
evaluate the travel time factor at each location. Use the location 
having the highest travel time factor value to assign the factor value 
for the aquifer. Enter this value in Table 3-1.
    3.1.2.5  Calculation of potential to release factor value. Sum the 
factor values for net precipitation, depth to aquifer, and travel time, 
and multiply this sum by the factor value for containment. Assign this 
product as the potential to release factor value for the aquifer. Enter 
this value in Table 3-1.
    3.1.3  Calculation of likelihood of release factor category value. 
If an observed release is established for an aquifer, assign the 
observed release factor value of 550 as the likelihood of release factor 
category value for that aquifer. Otherwise, assign the potential to 
release factor value for that aquifer as the likelihood of release 
value. Enter the value assigned in Table 3-1.

    3.2  Waste characteristics. Evaluate the waste characteristics 
factor category for an aquifer based on two factors: toxicity/mobility 
and hazardous waste quantity. Evaluate only those hazardous substances 
available to migrate from the sources at the site to ground water. Such 
hazardous substances include:
    <bullet> Hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed 
release to ground water.
    <bullet> All hazardous substances associated with a source that has 
a ground water containment factor value greater than 0 (see sections 
2.2.2, 2.2.3, and 3.1.2.1).
    3.2.1  Toxicity/mobility. For each hazardous substance, assign a 
toxicity factor value, a mobility factor value, and a combined toxicity/
mobility factor value as specified in the following sections. Select the 
toxicity/mobility factor value for the aquifer being evaluated as 
specified in section 3.2.1.3.
    3.2.1.1  Toxicity. Assign a toxicity factor value to each hazardous 
substance as specified in Section 2.4.1.1.
    3.2.1.2  Mobility. Assign a mobility factor value to each hazardous 
substance for the aquifer being evaluated as follows:
    <bullet> For any hazardous substance that meets the criteria for an 
observed release by chemical analysis to one or more aquifers underlying 
the sources at the site, regardless of the aquifer being evaluated, 
assign a mobility factor value of 1.
    <bullet> For any hazardous substance that does not meet the criteria 
for an observed release by chemical analysis to at least one of the 
aquifers, assign that hazardous substance a mobility factor value from 
Table 3-8 for the aquifer being evaluated, based on its water solubility 
and distribution coefficient (K<INF>d).
    <bullet> If the hazardous substance cannot be assigned a mobility 
factor value because data on its water solubility or distribution 
coefficient are not available, use other hazardous substances for which 
information is available in evaluating the pathway.

    <bullet> If none of the hazardous substances eligible to be 
evaluated can be assigned a mobility factor value, use a default value 
of 0.002 as the mobility factor value for all these hazardous 
substances.
    Determine the water solubility to be used in Table 3-8 for the 
hazardous substance as follows (use this same water solubility for all 
aquifers):
    <bullet> For any hazardous substance that does not meet the criteria 
for an observed release by chemical analysis, if the hazardous substance 
is present or deposited as a liquid, use the water solubility category 
``Present as Liquid'' in Table 3-8 to assign the mobility factor value 
to that hazardous substance.
    <bullet> Otherwise:
-For any hazardous substance that is a metal (or metalloid) and that 
does not meet the criteria for an observed release by chemical analysis, 
establish a water solubility for the hazardous substance as follows:
      -Determine the overall range of water solubilities for compounds 
of this hazardous substance (consider all compounds for which adequate 
water solubility information is available, not just compounds identified 
as present at the site).
      -Calculate the geometric mean of the highest and the lowest water 
solubility in this range.
      -Use this geometric mean as the water solubility in assigning the 
hazardous substance a mobility factor value from Table 3-8.
-For any other hazardous substance (either organic or inorganic) that 
does not meet the criteria for an observed release by chemical analysis, 
use the water solubility of that hazardous substance to assign a 
mobility factor value from Table 3-8 to the hazardous substance.

    For the aquifer being evaluated, determine the distribution 
coefficient to be used in Table 3-8 for the hazardous substance as 
follows:
    <bullet> For any hazardous substance that does not meet the criteria 
for an observed release by chemical analysis, if the entire interval 
from a source at the site to the aquifer being

[[Page 136]]

evaluated is karst, use the distribution coefficient category ``Karst'' 
in Table 3-8 in assigning the mobility factor value for that hazardous 
substance for that aquifer.
    <bullet> Otherwise:
-For any hazardous substance that is a metal (or metalloid) and that 
does not meet the criteria for an observed release by chemical analysis, 
use the distribution coefficient for the metal or (metalloid) to assign 
a mobility factor value from Table 3-8 for that hazardous substance.
-For any other inorganic hazardous substance that does not meet the 
criteria for an observed release by chemical analysis, use the 
distribution coefficient for that inorganic hazardous substance, if 
available, to assign a mobility factor value from Table 3-8. If the 
distribution coefficient is not available, use a default value of ``less 
than 10'' as the distribution coefficient, except: for asbestos use a 
default value of ``greater than 1,000'' as the distribution coefficient.
-For any hazardous substance that is organic and that does not meet the 
criteria for an observed release by chemical analysis, establish a 
distribution coefficient for that hazardous substance as follows:
      -Estimate the K<INF>d range for the hazardous substance using the 
following equation:

                K<INF>d=(K<INF>oc)(f<INF>s)

    where:

    K<INF>oc=Soil-water partition coefficient for organic carbon for the 
hazardous substance.
    f<INF>s=Sorbent content (fraction of clays plus organic carbon) in 
the subsurface.
      -Use f<INF>s values of 0.03 and 0.77 in the above equation to 
establish the upper and lower values of the K<INF>d range for the 
hazardous substance.
      -Calculate the geometric mean of the upper and lower K<INF>d range 
values. Use this geometric mean as the distribution coefficient in 
assigning the hazardous substance a mobility factor value from Table 3-
8.
    3.2.1.3  Calculation of toxicity/mobility factor value. Assign each 
hazardous substance a toxicity/mobility factor value from Table 3-9, 
based on the values assigned to the hazardous substance for the toxicity 
and mobility factors. Use the hazardous substance with the highest 
toxicity/mobility factor value for the aquifer being evaluated to assign 
the value to the toxicity/mobility factor for that aquifer. Enter this 
value in Table 3-1.

    3.2.2  Hazardous waste quantity. Assign a hazardous waste quantity 
factor value for the ground water pathway (or aquifer) as specified in 
section 2.4.2. Enter this value in Table 3-1.
    3.2.3  Calculation of waste characteristics factor category value. 
Multiply the toxicity/mobility and hazardous waste quantity factor 
values, subject to a maximum product of 1 x 10<SUP>8. Based on this 
product, assign a value from Table 2-7 (section 2.4.3.1) to the waste 
characteristics factor category. Enter this value in Table 3-1.
    3.3  Targets. Evaluate the targets factor category for an aquifer 
based on four factors: nearest well, population, resources, and Wellhead 
Protection Area. Evaluate these four factors based on targets within the 
target distance limit specified in section 3.0.1.1 and the aquifer 
boundaries specified in section 3.0.1.2. Determine the targets to be 
included in evaluating these factors for an aquifer as specified in 
section 3.0.
    3.3.1  Nearest well. In evaluating the nearest well factor, include 
both the drinking water wells drawing from the aquifer being evaluated 
and those drawing from overlying aquifers as specified in section 3.0. 
Include standby wells in evaluating this factor only if they are used 
for drinking water supply at least once every year.
    If there is an observed release by direct observation for a drinking 
water well within the target distance limit, assign Level II 
concentrations to that well. However, if one or more samples meet the 
criteria for an observed release for that well, determine if that well 
is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations as specified in 
sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. Use the health-based benchmarks

[[Page 137]]

from Table 3-10 in determining the level of contamination.
    Assign a value for the nearest well factor as follows:
    <bullet> If one or more drinking water wells is subject to Level I 
concentrations, assign a value of 50.
    <bullet> If not, but if one or more drinking water wells is subject 
to Level II concentrations, assign a value of 45.
    <bullet> If none of the drinking water wells is subject to Level I 
or Level II concentrations, assign a value as follows:
-If one of the target aquifers is a karst aquifer that underlies any 
portion of the sources at the site and any well draws drinking water 
from this karst aquifer within the target distance limit, assign a value 
of 20.
-If not, determine the shortest distance to any drinking water well, as 
measured from any source at the site with a ground water containment 
factor value greater than 0. Select a value from Table 3-11 based on 
this distance. Assign it as the value for the nearest well factor.
    Enter the value assigned to the nearest well factor in Table 3-1.

    3.3.2  Population. In evaluating the population factor, include 
those persons served by drinking water wells within the target distance 
limit specified in section 3.0.1.1. For the aquifer being evaluated, 
count those persons served by wells in that aquifer and those persons 
served by wells in overlying aquifers as specified in section 3.0. 
Include residents, students, and workers who regularly use the water. 
Exclude transient populations such as customers and travelers passing 
through the area. Evaluate the population based on the location of the 
water supply wells, not on the location of residences, work places, etc. 
When a standby well is maintained on a regular basis so that water can 
be withdrawn, include it in evaluating the population factor.
    In estimating residential population, when the estimate is based on 
the number of residences, multiply each residence by the average number 
of persons per residence for the county in which the residence is 
located.
    In determining the population served by a well, if the water from 
the well is blended with other water (for example, water from other 
ground water wells or surface water intakes), apportion the total 
population regularly served by the blended system to the well based on 
the well's relative contribution to the total blended system. In 
estimating the well's relative contribution, assume each well and intake 
contributes equally and apportion the population accordingly, except: if 
the relative contribution of any one well or intake exceeds 40 percent 
based on average annual pumpage or capacity, estimate the relative 
contribution of the wells and intakes considering the following data, if 
available:
    <bullet> Average annual pumpage from the ground water wells and 
surface water intakes in the blended system.
    <bullet> Capacities of the wells and intakes in the blended system.
     For systems with standby ground water wells or standby surface 
water intakes, apportion the total population regularly served by the 
blended system as described above, except:
    <bullet> Exclude standby surface water intakes in apportioning the 
population.
    <bullet> When using pumpage data for a standby ground water well, 
use average pumpage for the period during which the standby well is used 
rather than average annual pumpage.
    <bullet> For that portion of the total population that could be 
apportioned to a standby ground water well, assign that portion of the 
population either to that standby well or to the other ground water 
well(s) and surface water intake(s) that serve that population; do not 
assign that portion of the population both to the standby well and to 
the other well(s) and intake(s) in the blended system. Use the 
apportioning that results in the highest population factor value. 
(Either include all standby well(s) or exclude some or all of the 
standby well(s) as appropriate to obtain this highest value.) Note that 
the specific standby well(s) included or excluded and, thus, the 
specific apportioning may vary in evaluating different aquifers and in 
evaluating the surface water pathway.
    3.3.2.1  Level of contamination. Evaluate the population served by 
water from a point of

[[Page 138]]

withdrawal based on the level of contamination for that point of 
withdrawal. Use the applicable factor: Level I concentrations, Level II 
concentrations, or potential contamination.
    If no samples meet the criteria for an observed release for a point 
of withdrawal and there is no observed release by direct observation for 
that point of withdrawal, evaluate that point of withdrawal using the 
potential contamination factor in section 3.3.2.4. If there is an 
observed release by direct observation, use Level II concentrations for 
that point of withdrawal. However, if one or more samples meet the 
criteria for an observed release for the point of withdrawal, determine 
which factor (Level I or Level II concentrations) applies to that point 
of withdrawal as specified in sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. Use the health-
based benchmarks from Table 3-10 in determining the level of 
contamination. Evaluate the point of withdrawal using the Level I 
concentrations factor in section 3.3.2.2 or the Level II concentrations 
factor in section 3.3.2.3, as appropriate.
    For the potential contamination factor, use population ranges in 
evaluating the factor as specified in section 3.3.2.4. For the Level I 
and Level II concentrations factors, use the population estimate, not 
population ranges, in evaluating both factors.
    3.3.2.2  Level I concentrations. Sum the number of people served by 
drinking water from points of withdrawal subject to Level I 
concentrations. Multiply this sum by 10. Assign this product as the 
value for this factor. Enter this value in Table 3-1.
    3.3.2.3  Level II concentrations. Sum the number of people served by 
drinking water from points of withdrawal subject to Level II 
concentrations. Do not include those people already counted under the 
Level I concentrations factor. Assign this sum as the value for this 
factor. Enter this value in Table 3-1.
    3.3.2.4  Potential contamination. Determine the number of people 
served by drinking water from points of withdrawal subject to potential 
contamination. Do not include those people already counted under the 
Level I and Level II concentrations factors.
    Assign distance-weighted population values from Table 3-12 to this 
population as follows:
    <bullet> Use the ``Karst'' portion of Table 3-12 to assign values 
only for that portion of the population served by points of withdrawal 
that draw drinking water from a karst aquifer that underlies any portion 
of the sources at the site.
-For this portion of the population, determine the number of people 
included within each ``Karst'' distance category in Table 3-12.

[[Page 140]]

-Assign a distance-weighted population value for each distance category 
based on the number of people included within the distance category.

    <bullet> Use the ``Other Than Karst'' portion of Table 3-12 for the 
remainder of the population served by points of withdrawal subject to 
potential contamination.

-For this portion of the population, determine the number of people 
included within each ``Other Than Karst'' distance category in Table 3-
12.
-Assign a distance-weighted population value for each distance category 
based on the number of people included within the distance category.

    Calculate the value for the potential contamination factor (PC) as 
follows:

  .....................  1    n                                         
PC =...................  --   <greek-S>  (W<INF>i+K<INF>i)                        
  .....................  10  i=1                                        
                                                                        

where:
W<INF>i=Distance-weighted population from ``Other Than Karst'' portion 
          of Table 3-12 for distance category i.
K<INF>i=Distance-weighted population from ``Karst'' portion of Table 3-
          12 for distance category i.
n=Number of distance categories.

    If PC is less than 1, do not round it to the nearest integer; if PC 
is 1 or more, round to the nearest integer. Enter this value in Table 3-
1.
    3.3.2.5  Calculation of population factor value. Sum the factor 
values for Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, and 
potential contamination. Do not round this sum to the nearest integer. 
Assign this sum as the population factor value for the aquifer. Enter 
this value in Table 3-1.
    3.3.3  Resources. To evaluate the resources factor, select the 
highest value specified below that applies for the aquifer being 
evaluated. Assign this value as the resources factor value for the 
aquifer. Enter this value in Table 3-1.
    Assign a resources value of 5 if water drawn from any target well 
for the aquifer being evaluated or overlying aquifers (as specified in 
section 3.0) is used for one or more of the following purposes:
    <bullet> Irrigation (5-acre minimum) of commercial food crops or 
commercial forage crops.
    <bullet> Watering of commercial livestock.
    <bullet> Ingredient in commercial food preparation.
    <bullet> Supply for commercial aquaculture.
    <bullet> Supply for a major or designated water recreation area, 
excluding drinking water use.

    Assign a resources value of 5 if no drinking water wells are within 
the target distance limit, but the water in the aquifer being evaluated 
or any overlying aquifers (as specified in section 3.0) is usable for 
drinking water purposes.
    Assign a resources value of 0 if none of the above applies.
    3.3.4  Wellhead Protection Area. Evaluate the Wellhead Protection 
Area factor based on Wellhead Protection Areas designated according to 
section 1428 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended. Consider only 
those Wellhead Protection Areas applicable to the aquifer being 
evaluated or overlying aquifers (as specified in section 3.0). Select 
the highest value below that applies. Assign it as the value for the 
Wellhead Protection Area factor for the aquifer being evaluated. Enter 
this value in Table 3-1.
     Assign a value of 20 if either of the following criteria applies 
for the aquifer being evaluated or overlying aquifers:
    <bullet> A source with a ground water containment factor value 
greater than 0 lies, either partially or fully, within or above the 
designated Wellhead Protection Area.
    <bullet> Observed ground water contamination attributable to the 
sources at the site lies, either partially or fully, within the 
designated Wellhead Protection Area.

    If neither criterion applies, assign a value of 5, if, within the 
target distance limit, there is a designated Wellhead Protection Area 
applicable to the aquifer being evaluated or overlying aquifers.
    Assign a value of 0 if none of the above applies.
    3.3.5  Calculation of targets factor category value. Sum the factor 
values for nearest well, population, resources, and Wellhead Protection 
Area. Do not round this sum to the nearest integer. Use this sum as the 
targets factor category value for the aquifer. Enter this value in Table 
3-1.
    3.4  Ground water migration score for an aquifer. For the aquifer 
being evaluated, multiply the factor category values for likelihood of 
release, waste characteristics, and targets, and round the product to 
the nearest integer. Then divide by 82,500. Assign the resulting value, 
subject to a maximum value of 100, as the ground water migration pathway 
score for the aquifer. Enter this score in Table 3-1.
    3.5  Calculation of ground water migration pathway score. Calculate 
a ground water migration score for each aquifer underlying the sources 
at the site, as appropriate. Assign the highest ground water migration 
score for an aquifer as the ground water migration pathway score 
(S<INF>gw) for the site. Enter this score in Table 3-1.
4.0  Surface Water Migration Pathway.
    4.0.1  Migration components. Evaluate the surface water migration 
pathway based on two migration components:
    <bullet> Overland/flood migration to surface water (see section 
4.1).

[[Page 141]]

    <bullet> Ground water to surface water migration (see section 4.2).

Evaluate each component based on the same three threats: drinking water 
threat, human food chain threat, and environmental threat.
    Score one or both components, considering their relative importance. 
If only one component is scored, assign its score as the surface water 
migration pathway score. If both components are scored, select the 
higher of the two scores and assign it as the surface water migration 
pathway score.

    4.0.2  Surface water categories. For HRS purposes, classify surface 
water into four categories: rivers, lakes, oceans, and coastal tidal 
waters.
    Rivers include:
    <bullet> Perennially flowing waters from point of origin to the 
ocean or to coastal tidal waters, whichever comes first, and wetlands 
contiguous to these flowing waters.
    <bullet> Aboveground portions of disappearing rivers.
    <bullet> Man-made ditches only insofar as they perennially flow into 
other surface water.
    <bullet> Intermittently flowing waters and contiguous intermittently 
flowing ditches only in arid or semiarid areas with less than 20 inches 
of mean annual precipitation.
    Lakes include:
    <bullet> Natural and man-made lakes (including impoundments) that 
lie along rivers, but excluding the Great Lakes.
    <bullet> Isolated, but perennial, lakes, ponds, and wetlands.
    <bullet> Static water channels or oxbow lakes contiguous to rivers.
    <bullet> Small rivers, without diking, that merge into surrounding 
perennially inundated wetlands.
    <bullet> Wetlands contiguous to water bodies defined here as lakes.
    Ocean and ocean-like water bodies include:
    <bullet> Ocean areas seaward from the baseline of the Territorial 
Sea. (This baseline represents the generalized coastline of the United 
States. It is parallel to the seaward limit of the Territorial Sea and 
other maritime limits such as the inner boundary of Federal fisheries 
jurisdiction and the limit of States jurisdiction under the Submerged 
Lands Act, as amended.)
    <bullet> The Great Lakes.
    <bullet> Wetlands contiguous to the Great Lakes.
    Coastal tidal waters include:
    <bullet> Embayments, harbors, sounds, estuaries, back bays, lagoons, 
wetlands, etc. seaward from mouths of rivers and landward from the 
baseline of the Territorial Sea.

    4.1  Overland/flood migration component. Use the overland/flood 
migration component to evaluate surface water threats that result from 
overland migration of hazardous substances from a source at the site to 
surface water. Evaluate three types of threats for this component: 
drinking water threat, human food chain threat, and environmental 
threat.
    4.1.1  General considerations.
    4.1.1.1  Definition of hazardous substance migration path for 
overland/flood migration component. The hazardous substance migration 
path includes both the overland segment and the in-water segment that 
hazardous substances would take as they migrate away from sources at the 
site:
    <bullet> Begin the overland segment at a source and proceed 
downgradient to the probable point of entry to surface water.
    <bullet> Begin the in-water segment at this probable point of entry.

-For rivers, continue the in-water segment in the direction of flow 
(including any tidal flows) for the distance established by the target 
distance limit (see section 4.1.1.2).
-For lakes, oceans, coastal tidal waters, or Great Lakes, do not 
consider flow direction. Instead apply the target distance limit as an 
arc.
-If the in-water segment includes both rivers and lakes (or oceans, 
coastal tidal waters, or Great Lakes), apply the target distance limit 
to their combined in-water segments.

    For sites that consist of contaminated sediments with no identified 
source, the hazardous substance migration path consists solely of the 
in-water segment specified in section 4.1.1.2.
    Consider a site to be in two or more watersheds for this component 
if two or more hazardous substance migration paths from the sources at 
the site do not reach a common point within the target distance limit. 
If the site is in more than one watershed, define a separate hazardous 
substance migration path for each watershed. Evaluate the overland/flood 
migration component for each watershed separately as specified in 
section 4.1.1.3.
    4.1.1.2  Target distance limit. The target distance limit defines 
the maximum distance over which targets are considered in evaluating the 
site. Determine a separate target distance limit for each watershed as 
follows:
    <bullet> If there is no observed release to surface water in the 
watershed or if there is an observed release only by direct observation 
(see section 4.1.2.1.1), begin measuring the target distance limit for 
the watershed at the probable point of entry to surface water and extend 
it for 15 miles along the surface water from that point.
    <bullet> If there is an observed release from the site to the 
surface water in the watershed that is based on sampling, begin 
measuring the target distance limit for the watershed at the probable 
point of entry; extend the target distance limit either for 15 miles 
along the surface water or to the most distant sample point that meets 
the criteria for an observed release to that watershed, whichever is 
greater.

[[Page 142]]

    In evaluating the site, include only surface water targets (for 
example, intakes, fisheries, sensitive environments) that are within or 
contiguous to the hazardous substance migration path and located, 
partially or wholly, at or between the probable point of entry and the 
target distance limit applicable to the watershed:
    <bullet> If flow within the hazardous substance migration path is 
reversed by tides, evaluate upstream targets only if there is 
documentation that the tidal run could carry substances from the site as 
far as those upstream targets.
    <bullet> Determine whether targets within or contiguous to the 
hazardous substance migration path are subject to actual or potential 
contamination as follows:

-If a target is located, partially or wholly, either at or between the 
probable point of entry and any sampling point that meets the criteria 
for an observed release to the watershed or at a point that meets the 
criteria for an observed release by direct observation, evaluate that 
target as subject to actual contamination, except as otherwise specified 
for fisheries in section 4.1.3.3 and for wetlands in section 
4.1.4.3.1.1. If the actual contamination is based on direct observation, 
assign Level II to the actual contamination. However, if the actual 
contamination is based on samples, determine whether the actual 
contamination is at Level I or Level II concentrations as specified in 
sections 4.1.2.3, 4.1.3.3, and 4.1.4.3.1.
-If a target is located, partially or wholly, within the target distance 
limit for the watershed, but not at or between the probable point of 
entry and any sampling point that meets the criteria for an observed 
release to the watershed, nor at a point that meets the criteria for an 
observed release by direct observation, evaluate it as subject to 
potential contamination.

    For sites consisting solely of contaminated sediments with no 
identified source, determine the target distance limit as follows:
    <bullet> If there is a clearly defined direction of flow for the 
surface water body (or bodies) containing the contaminated sediments, 
begin measuring the target distance limit at the point of observed 
sediment contamination that is farthest upstream (that is, at the 
location of the farthest available upstream sediment sample that meets 
the criteria for an observed release); extend the target distance limit 
either for 15 miles along the surface water or to the most distant 
downstream sample point that meets the criteria for an observed release 
to that watershed, whichever is greater.
    <bullet> If there is no clearly defined direction of flow, begin 
measuring the target distance limit at the center of the area of 
observed sediment contamination. Extend the target distance limit as an 
arc either for 15 miles along the surface water or to the most distant 
sample point that meets the criteria for an observed release to that 
watershed, whichever is greater. Determine the area of observed sediment 
contamination based on available samples that meet the criteria for an 
observed release.

Note that the hazardous substance migration path for these contaminated 
sediment sites consists solely of the in-water segment defined by the 
target distance limit; there is no overland segment.
    For these contaminated sediment sites, include only those targets 
(for example, intakes, fisheries, sensitive environments) that are 
within or contiguous to the hazardous substance migration path and 
located, wholly or partially, within the target distance limit for the 
site. Determine whether these targets are subject to actual or potential 
contamination as follows:
    <bullet> If a target is located, partially or wholly, within the 
area of observed sediment contamination, evaluate it as subject to 
actual contamination, except as otherwise specified for fisheries in 
section 4.1.3.3 and wetlands in section 4.1.4.3.1.1.

-If a drinking water target is subject to actual contamination, evaluate 
it using Level II concentrations.
-If a human food chain target or environmental target is subject to 
actual contamination, evaluate it using Level I or Level II 
concentrations, as appropriate (see sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.1.4.3.1).

    <bullet> If a target is located, partially or wholly, within the 
target distance limit for the watershed, but not within the area of 
observed sediment contamination, evaluate it as subject to potential 
contamination.
    4.1.1.3 Evaluation of overland/flood migration component. Evaluate 
the drinking water threat, human food chain threat, and environmental 
threat for each watershed for this component based on three factor 
categories: likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets. 
Figure 4-1 indicates the factors included within each factor category 
for each type of threat.
    Determine the overland/flood migration component score (S<INF>of) 
for a watershed in terms of the factor category values as follows:

                                                                 3       (LR<INF>i)(WC<INF>i)(T<INF>i)                         
                                                  S<INF>of =  <greek-S>     ----------------                         
                                                                i=1          SF

where:
LR<INF>i=Likelihood of release factor category value for threat i (that 
          is, drinking water, human food chain, or environmental 
          threat).
WC<INF>i=Waste characteristics factor category value for threat i.
T<INF>i=Targets factor category value for threat i.
SF=Scaling factor.
Table 4-1 outlines the specific calculation procedure.
    If the site is in only one watershed, assign the overland/flood 
migration score for that watershed as the overland/flood migration 
component score for the site.

    If the site is in more than one watershed:
    <bullet> Calculate a separate overland/flood migration component 
score for each watershed, using likelihood of release, waste 
characteristics, and targets applicable to each watershed.
    <bullet> Select the highest overland/flood migration component score 
from the watersheds evaluated and assign it as the overland/flood 
migration component score for the site.

    4.1.2  Drinking water threat. Evaluate the drinking water threat for 
each watershed based on three factor categories: likelihood of release, 
waste characteristics, and targets.
    4.1.2.1  Drinking water threat--likelihood of release. Evaluate the 
likelihood of release factor category for each watershed in terms of an 
observed release factor or a potential to release factor.
    4.1.2.1.1  Observed release. Establish an observed release to 
surface water for a watershed by demonstrating that the site has 
released a hazardous substance to the surface water in the watershed. 
Base this demonstration on either:

    <bullet> Direct observation:

-A material that contains one or more hazardous substances has been seen 
entering surface water through migration or is known to have entered 
surface water through direct deposition, or
-A source area has been flooded at a time that hazardous substances were 
present, and one or more hazardous substances were in contact with the 
flood waters, or

-When evidence supports the inference of a release of a material that 
contains one or more hazardous substances by the site to surface water, 
demonstrated adverse effects associated with that release may also be 
used to establish an observed release.
    <bullet> Chemical analysis:

-Analysis of surface water, benthic, or sediment samples indicates that 
the concentration of hazardous substance(s) has increased significantly 
above the background concentration for the site for that type of sample 
(see section 2.3).
      -Limit comparisons to similar types of samples and background 
concentrations--for example, compare surface water samples to surface 
water background concentrations.
      -For benthic samples, limit comparisons to essentially sessile 
organisms.
-Some portion of the significant increase must be attributable to the 
site to establish the observed release, except: when the site itself 
consists of contaminated sediments with no identified source, no 
separate attribution is required.

    If an observed release can be established for a watershed, assign an 
observed release factor value of 550 to that watershed, enter this value 
in Table 4-1, and proceed to section 4.1.2.1.3. If no observed release 
can be established for the watershed, assign an observed release factor 
value of 0 to that watershed, enter this value in Table 4-1, and proceed 
to section 4.1.2.1.2.
    4.1.2.1.2  Potential to release. Evaluate potential to release only 
if an observed release cannot be established for the watershed. Evaluate 
potential to release based on two components: potential to release by 
overland flow (see section 4.1.2.1.2.1) and potential to release by 
flood (see section 4.1.2.1.2.2). Sum the values for these two components 
to obtain the potential to release factor value for the watershed, 
subject to a maximum value of 500.
    4.1.2.1.2.1  Potential to release by overland flow. Evaluate 
potential to release by overland flow for the watershed based on three 
factors: containment, runoff, and distance to surface water.
    Assign potential to release by overland flow a value of 0 for the 
watershed if:
    <bullet> No overland segment of the hazardous substance migration 
path can be defined for the watershed, or
    <bullet> The overland segment of the hazardous substance migration 
path for the watershed exceeds 2 miles before surface water is 
encountered.

If either condition applies, enter a value of 0 in Table 4-1 and proceed 
to section 4.1.2.1.2.2 to evaluate potential to release by flood. If 
neither applies, proceed to section 4.1.2.1.2.1.1 to evaluate potential 
to release by overland flow.
    4.1.2.1.2.1.1  Containment. Determine the containment factor value 
for the watershed as follows:
    <bullet> If one or more sources is located in surface water in the 
watershed (for example, intact sealed drums in surface water), assign

[[Page 147]]

the containment factor a value of 10 for the watershed. Enter this value 
in Table 4-1.
    <bullet> If none of the sources is located in surface water in the 
watershed, assign a containment factor value from Table 4-2 to each 
source at the site that can potentially release hazardous substances to 
the hazardous substance migration path for this watershed. Assign the 
containment factor value for the watershed as follows:

-Select the highest containment factor value assigned to those sources 
that meet the minimum size requirement described below. Assign this 
highest value as the containment factor value for the watershed. Enter 
this value in Table 4-1.
-If, for this watershed, no source at the site meets the minimum size 
requirement, then select the highest containment factor value assigned 
to the sources at the site eligible to be evaluated for this watershed 
and assign it as the containment factor value for the watershed. Enter 
this value in Table 4-1.

    A source meets the minimum size requirement if its source hazardous 
waste quantity value (see section 2.4.2.1.5) is 0.5 or more. Do not 
include the minimum size requirement in evaluating any other factor of 
this surface water migration component, except potential to release by 
flood as specified in section 4.1.2.1.2.2.3.
    4.1.2.1.2.1.2  Runoff. Evaluate runoff based on three components: 
rainfall, drainage area, and soil group.

    Rainfall. Determine the 2-year, 24-hour rainfall for the site. Use 
site-specific, 2-year, 24-hour rainfall data if records are available 
for at least 20 years. If such site-specific data

[[Page 149]]

are not available, estimate the 2-year, 24-hour rainfall for the site 
from a rainfall-frequency map. Do not round the rainfall value to the 
nearest integer.
    Drainage area. Determine the drainage area for the sources at the 
site. Include in this drainage area both the source areas and the area 
upgradient of the sources, but exclude any portion of this drainage area 
for which runoff is diverted from entering the sources by storm sewers 
or run-on control and/or runoff management systems. Assign a drainage 
area value for the watershed from Table 4-3.
    Soil group. Based on the predominant soil group within the drainage 
area described above, assign a soil group designation for the watershed 
from Table 4-4 as follows:
    <bullet> Select the predominant soil group as that type which 
comprises the largest total area within the applicable drainage area.
    <bullet> If a predominant soil group cannot be delineated, select 
that soil group in the drainage area that yields the highest value for 
the runoff factor.
    Calculation of runoff factor value. Assign a combined rainfall/
runoff value for the watershed from Table 4-5, based on the 2-year, 24-
hour rainfall and the soil group designation. Determine the runoff 
factor value for the watershed from Table 4-6, based on the rainfall/
runoff and drainage area values. Enter the runoff factor value in Table 
4-1.

    4.1.2.1.2.1.3  Distance to surface water. Evaluate the distance to 
surface water as the shortest distance, along the overland segment, from 
any source with a surface water containment factor value greater than 0 
to either the mean high water level for tidal waters or the mean water 
level for other surface waters. Based on this distance, assign a value 
from Table 4-7 to the distance to surface water factor for the 
watershed. Enter this value in Table 4-1.
    4.1.2.1.2.1.4  Calculation of factor value for potential to release 
by overland flow. Sum the factor values for runoff and distance to 
surface water for the watershed and multiply this sum by the factor 
value for containment. Assign the resulting product as the factor value 
for potential to release by overland flow for the watershed. Enter this 
value in Table 4-1.
    4.1.2.1.2.2  Potential to release by flood. Evaluate potential to 
release by flood for each watershed as the product of two factors: 
containment (flood) and flood frequency. Evaluate potential to release 
by flood separately for each source that is within the watershed. 
Furthermore, for each source, evaluate potential to release by flood 
separately for each category of floodplain in which the source lies. 
(See section 4.1.2.1.2.2.2 for the applicable floodplain categories.) 
Calculate the value for the potential to release by flood factor as 
specified in 4.1.2.1.2.2.3.
    4.1.2.1.2.2.1  Containment (flood). For each source within the 
watershed, separately evaluate the containment (flood) factor for each 
category of floodplain in which the source is partially or wholly 
located. Assign a containment (flood) factor value from Table 4-8 to 
each floodplain category applicable to that source. Assign a containment 
(flood) factor value of 0 to each floodplain category in which the 
source does not lie.

[[Page 150]]

    4.1.2.1.2.2.2  Flood frequency. For each source within the 
watershed, separately evaluate the flood frequency factor for each 
category of floodplain in which the source is partially or wholly 
located. Assign a flood frequency factor value from Table 4-9 to each 
floodplain category in which the source is located.
    4.1.2.1.2.2.3  Calculation of factor value for potential to release 
by flood. For each source within the watershed and for each category of 
floodplain in which the source is partially or wholly located, calculate 
a separate potential to release by flood factor value. Calculate this 
value as the product of the containment (flood) value and the flood 
frequency value applicable to the source for the floodplain category. 
Select the highest value calculated for those sources that meet the 
minimum size requirement specified in section 4.1.2.1.2.1.1 and assign 
it as the value for the potential to release by flood factor for the 
watershed. However, if, for this watershed, no source at the site meets 
the minimum size requirement, select the highest value calculated for 
the sources at the site eligible to be evaluated for this watershed and 
assign it as the value for this factor.

    Enter this highest potential to release by flood factor value for

(flood) and flood frequency that yield this highest value.
    4.1.2.1.2.3  Calculation of potential to release factor value. Sum 
the factor values assigned to the watershed for potential to release by 
overland flow and potential to release by flood. Assign this sum as the 
potential to release factor value for the watershed, subject to a 
maximum value of 500. Enter this value in Table 4-1.
    4.1.2.1.3  Calculation of drinking water threat-likelihood of 
release factor category value. If an observed release is established for 
the watershed, assign the observed release factor value of 550 as the 
likelihood of release factor category value for that watershed. 
Otherwise, assign the potential to release factor value for that 
watershed as the likelihood of release factor category value for that 
watershed. Enter the value assigned in Table 4-1.
    4.1.2.2   Drinking water threat-waste characteristics. Evaluate the 
waste characteristics factor category for each watershed based on two 
factors: toxicity/persistence and hazardous waste quantity. Evaluate 
only those hazardous substances that are available to migrate from the 
sources at the site to surface water in the watershed via the overland/
flood hazardous substance migration path for the watershed (see section 
4.1.1.1). Such hazardous substances include:
    <bullet> Hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed 
release to surface water in the watershed.
    <bullet> All hazardous substances associated with a source that has 
a surface water containment factor value greater than 0 for the 
watershed (see sections 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 4.1.2.1.2.1.1, and 4.1.2.1.2.2.1).
    4.1.2.2.1  Toxicity/persistence. For each hazardous substance, 
assign a toxicity factor value, a persistence factor value, and a 
combined toxicity/persistence factor value as specified in sections 
4.1.2.2.1.1 through 4.1.2.2.1.3. Select the toxicity/persistence factor 
value for the watershed as specified in section 4.1.2.2.1.3.
    4.1.2.2.1.1  Toxicity. Assign a toxicity factor value to each 
hazardous substance as specified in section 2.4.1.1.
    4.1.2.2.1.2  Persistence. Assign a persistence factor value to each 
hazardous substance. In assigning this value, evaluate persistence based 
primarily on the half-life of the hazardous substance in surface water 
and secondarily on the sorption of the hazardous substance to sediments. 
The half-life in surface water is defined for HRS purposes as the time 
required to reduce the initial concentration in surface water by one-
half as a result of the combined decay processes of biodegradation, 
hydrolysis, photolysis, and volatilization. Sorption to sediments is 
evaluated for the HRS based on the logarithm of the n-octanol-water 
partition coefficient (log K<INF>ow) of the hazardous substance.

[[Page 151]]

    Estimate the half-life (t<INF>1/2) of a hazardous substance as 
follows:

                                                                   1

                                                         1/h + 1/b + 1/p + 1/v                                  
                                                                                                                

where:

h=Hydrolysis half-life.
b=Biodegradation half-life.
p=Photolysis half-life.
v=Volatilization half-life.

    If one or more of these four component half-lives cannot be 
estimated for the hazardous substance from available data, delete that 
component half-life from the above equation. If none of these four 
component half-lives can be estimated for the hazardous substance from 
available data, use the default procedure indicated below. Estimate a 
half-life for the hazardous substance for lakes or for rivers, oceans, 
coastal tidal waters, and Great Lakes, as appropriate.
    If a half-life can be estimated for a hazardous substance:
    <bullet> Assign that hazardous substance a persistence factor value 
from the appropriate portion of Table 4-10 (that is lakes; or rivers, 
oceans, coastal tidal waters, and Great Lakes).
    <bullet> Select the appropriate portion of Table 4-10 as follows:

-If there is one or more drinking water intakes along the hazardous 
substance migration path for the watershed, select the nearest drinking 
water intake as measured from the probable point of entry. If the in-
water segment between the probable point of entry and this selected 
intake includes both lakes and other water bodies, use the lakes portion 
of Table 4-10 only if more than half the distance to this selected 
intake lies in lake(s). Otherwise, use the rivers, oceans, coastal tidal 
waters, and Great Lakes portion of Table 4-10. For contaminated 
sediments with no identified source, use the point where measurement 
begins (see section 4.1.1.2) rather than the probable point of entry.
-If there are no drinking water intakes but there are intakes or points 
of use for any of the resource types listed in section 4.1.2.3.3, select 
the nearest such intake or point of use. Select the portion of Table 4-
10 based on this intake or point of use in the manner specified for 
drinking water intakes.
-If there are no drinking water intakes and no specified resource 
intakes and points of use, but there is another type of resource listed 
in section 4.1.2.3.3 (for example, the water is usable for drinking 
water purposes even though not used), select the portion of Table 4-10 
based on the nearest point of this resource in the manner specified for 
drinking water intakes.

    If a half-life cannot be estimated for a hazardous substance from 
available data, use the following default procedure to assign a 
persistence factor value to that hazardous substance:
    <bullet> For those hazardous substances that are metals (or 
metalloids), assign a persistence factor value of 1 as a default for all 
surface water bodies.
    <bullet> For other hazardous substances (both organic and 
inorganic), assign a persistence factor value of 0.4 as a default for 
rivers, oceans, coastal tidal waters, and Great Lakes, and a persistence 
factor value of 0.07 as a default for lakes. Select the appropriate 
value in the same manner specified for using Table 4-10.

    Use the persistence factor value assigned based on half-life or the 
default procedure unless the hazardous substance can be assigned a 
higher factor value from Table 4-11, based on its Log K<INF>ow. If a 
higher value can be assigned from Table 4-11, assign this higher value 
as the persistence factor value for the hazardous substance.

    4.1.2.2.1.3  Calculation of toxicity/persistence factor value. 
Assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/persistence factor value from 
Table 4-12, based on the values assigned to the hazardous substance for 
the toxicity and persistence factors. Use the hazardous substance with 
the highest toxicity/persistence factor value for the watershed to 
assign the toxicity/persistence factor value for the drinking water 
threat for the watershed. Enter this value in Table 4-1.
    4.1.2.2.2  Hazardous waste quantity. Assign a hazardous waste 
quantity factor value for the watershed as specified in section 2.4.2. 
Enter this value in Table 4-1.

    4.1.2.3  Drinking water threat-targets. Evaluate the targets factor 
category for each watershed based on three factors: nearest intake, 
population, and resources.
    To evaluate the nearest intake and population factors, determine 
whether the target surface water intakes are subject to actual or 
potential contamination as specified in section 4.1.1.2. Use either an 
observed release based on direct observation at the intake or the 
exposure concentrations from samples (or comparable samples) taken at or 
beyond the intake to make this determination (see section 4.1.2.1.1). 
The exposure concentrations for a sample (that is, surface water, 
benthic, or sediment sample) consist of the concentrations of those 
hazardous substances present that are significantly above background 
levels and attributable at least in part to the site (that is, those 
hazardous substance concentrations that meet the criteria for an 
observed release).
    When an intake is subject to actual contamination, evaluate it using 
Level I concentrations or Level II concentrations. If the actual 
contamination is based on an observed release by direct observation, use 
Level II concentrations for that intake. However, if the actual 
contamination is based on an observed release from samples, determine 
which level applies for the intake by comparing the exposure 
concentrations from samples (or comparable samples) to health-based 
benchmarks as specified in sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. Use the health-
based benchmarks from Table 3-10 (section 3.3.1) in determining the 
level of contamination from samples. For contaminated sediments with no 
identified source, evaluate the actual contamination using Level II 
concentrations (see section 4.1.1.2).
    4.1.2.3.1  Nearest intake. Evaluate the nearest intake factor based 
on the drinking water intakes along the overland/flood hazardous 
substance migration path for the watershed. Include standby intakes in 
evaluating this factor only if they are used for supply at least once a 
year.
    Assign the nearest intake factor a value as follows and enter the 
value in Table 4-1:
    <bullet> If one or more of these drinking water intakes is subject 
to Level I concentrations as specified in section 4.1.2.3, assign a 
factor value of 50.
    <bullet> If not, but if one or more of these drinking water intakes 
is subject to Level II concentrations, assign a factor value of 45.
    <bullet> If none of these drinking water intakes is subject to Level 
I or Level II concentrations, determine the nearest of these drinking 
water intakes, as measured from the probable point of entry (or from the 
point where measurement begins for contaminated sediments with no 
identified source). Assign a dilution weight from Table 4-13 to this 
intake, based on the type of surface water body in which it is located. 
Multiply this dilution weight by 20, round the product to the nearest 
integer, and assign it as the factor value.

  amended.                                                                                                      

    <bullet> For a river (that is, surface water body types specified in 
Table 4-13 as minimal stream through very large river), assign a 
dilution weight based on the average annual flow in the river at the 
intake. If available, use the average annual discharge as defined in the 
U.S. Geological Survey Water Resources Data Annual Report. Otherwise, 
estimate the average annual flow.
    <bullet> For a lake, assign a dilution weight as follows:

-For a lake that has surface water flow entering the lake, assign a 
dilution weight based on the sum of the average annual flows for the 
surface water bodies entering the lake up to the point of the intake.
-For a lake that has no surface water flow entering, but that does have 
surface water flow leaving, assign a dilution weight based on the sum of 
the average annual flows for the surface water bodies leaving the lake.
-For a closed lake (that is, a lake without surface water flow entering 
or leaving), assign a dilution weight based on the average annual ground 
water flow into the lake, if available, using the dilution weight for 
the corresponding river flow rate in Table 4-13. If not available, 
assign a default dilution weight of 1.

    <bullet> For the ocean and the Great Lakes, assign a dilution weight 
based on depth.
    <bullet> For coastal tidal waters, assign a dilution weight of 
0.0001; do not consider depth or flow.
    <bullet> For a quiet-flowing river that has average annual flow of 
10 cubic feet per second (cfs) or greater and that contains the probable 
point of entry to surface water, apply a zone of mixing in assigning the 
dilution weight:

-Start the zone of mixing at the probable point of entry and extend it 
for 3 miles from the probable point of entry, except: if the surface 
water characteristics change to turbulent within this 3-mile distance, 
extend the zone of mixing only to the point at which the change occurs.
-Assign a dilution weight of 0.5 to any intake that lies within this 
zone of mixing.
-Beyond this zone of mixing, assign a dilution weight the same as for 
any other river (that is, assign the dilution weight based on average 
annual flow).
-Treat a quiet-flowing river with an average annual flow of less than 10 
cfs the same as any other river (that is, assign it a dilution weight of 
1).

In those cases where water flows from a surface water body with a lower 
assigned dilution weight (from Table 4-13) to a surface water body with 
a higher assigned dilution weight (that is, water flows from a surface 
water body with more dilution to one with less dilution), use the lower 
assigned dilution weight as the dilution weight for the latter surface 
water body.
    4.1.2.3.2  Population. In evaluating the population factor, include 
only persons served by drinking water drawn from intakes that are along 
the overland/flood hazardous substance migration path for the watershed 
and that are within the target distance limit specified in section 
4.1.1.2. Include residents, students, and workers who regularly use the 
water. Exclude transient populations such as customers and travelers 
passing through the area. When a standby intake is maintained

[[Page 154]]

on a regular basis so that water can be withdrawn, include it in 
evaluating the population factor.
    In estimating residential population, when the estimate is based on 
the number of residences, multiply each residence by the average number 
of persons per residence for the county in which the residence is 
located.
    In estimating the population served by an intake, if the water from 
the intake is blended with other water (for example, water from other 
surface water intakes or ground water wells), apportion the total 
population regularly served by the blended system to the intake based on 
the intake's relative contribution to the total blended system. In 
estimating the intake's relative contribution, assume each well or 
intake contributes equally and apportion the population accordingly, 
except: if the relative contribution of any one intake or well exceeds 
40 percent based on average annual pumpage or capacity, estimate the 
relative contribution of the wells and intakes considering the following 
data, if available:
    <bullet> Average annual pumpage from the ground water wells and 
surface water intakes in the blended system.
    <bullet> Capacities of the wells and intakes in the blended system.

    For systems with standby surface water intakes or standby ground 
water wells, apportion the total population regularly served by the 
blended system as described above, except:
    <bullet> Exclude standby ground water wells in apportioning the 
population.
    <bullet> When using pumpage data for a standby surface water intake, 
use average pumpage for the period during which the standby intake is 
used rather than average annual pumpage.
    <bullet> For that portion of the total population that could be 
apportioned to a standby surface water intake, assign that portion of 
the population either to that standby intake or to the other surface 
water intake(s) and ground water well(s) that serve that population; do 
not assign that portion of the population both to the standby intake and 
to the other intake(s) and well(s) in the blended system. Use the 
apportioning that results in the highest population factor value. 
(Either include all standby intake(s) or exclude some or all of the 
standby intake(s) as appropriate to obtain this highest value.) Note 
that the specific standby intake(s) included or excluded and, thus, the 
specific apportioning may vary in evaluating different watersheds and in 
evaluating the ground water pathway.
    4.1.2.3.2.1  Level of contamination. Evaluate the population factor 
based on three factors: Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, 
and potential contamination. Determine which factor applies for an 
intake as specified in section 4.1.2.3. Evaluate intakes subject to 
Level I concentration as specified in section 4.1.2.3.2.2, intakes 
subject to Level II concentration as specified in section 4.1.2.3.2.3, 
and intakes subject to potential contamination as specified in section 
4.1.2.3.2.4.
    For the potential contamination factor, use population ranges in 
evaluating the factor as specified in section 4.1.2.3.2.4. For the Level 
I and Level II concentrations factors, use the population estimate, not 
population ranges, in evaluating both factors.
    4.1.2.3.2.2  Level I concentrations. Sum the number of people served 
by drinking water from intakes subject to Level I concentrations. 
Multiply this sum by 10. Assign this product as the value for this 
factor. Enter this value in Table 4-1.
    4.1.2.3.2.3  Level II concentrations. Sum the number of people 
served by drinking water from intakes subject to Level II 
concentrations. Do not include people already counted under the Level I 
concentrations factor. Assign this sum as the value for this factor. 
Enter this value in Table 4-1.
    4.1.2.3.2.4  Potential contamination. For each applicable type of 
surface water body in Table 4-14, first determine the number of people 
served by drinking water from intakes subject to potential contamination 
in that type of surface water body. Do not include those people already 
counted under the Level I and Level II concentrations factors.

    For each type of surface water body, assign a dilution-weighted 
population value from Table 4-14, based on the number of people included 
for that type of surface water body. (Note that the dilution-weighted 
population values in Table 4-14 incorporate the dilution weights from

where:

W<INF>i=Dilution-weighted population from Table 4-14 for surface water 
          body type i.
n=Number of different surface water body types in the watershed.

is 1 or more, round to the nearest integer. Enter this value for the 
potential contamination factor in Table 4-1.

for one or more of the following purposes:
    <bullet> Irrigation (5 acre minimum) of commercial food crops or 
commercial forage crops.
    <bullet> Watering of commercial livestock.
    <bullet> Ingredient in commercial food preparation.
    <bullet> Major or designated water recreation area, excluding

used for drinking water, but either of the following applies:
    <bullet> Any portion of the surface water is designated by a State 
for drinking water use under section 305(a) of the Clean Water Act, as

subject to a maximum of 100, as the drinking water threat score for the 
watershed. Enter this value in Table 4-1.
    4.1.3  Human food chain threat. Evaluate the human food chain threat 
for each watershed based on three factor categories: likelihood of 
release, waste characteristics, and targets.
    4.1.3.1  Human food chain threat-likelihood of release. Assign the 
same likelihood of release factor category value for the human food 
chain threat for the watershed as would be assigned in section 4.1.2.1.3 
for the drinking water threat. Enter this value in Table 4-1.
    4.1.3.2  Human food chain threat-waste characteristics. Evaluate the 
waste characteristics factor category for each watershed based on two 
factors: toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation and hazardous waste 
quantity.
    4.1.3.2.1  Toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation. Evaluate all those 
hazardous substances eligible to be evaluated for toxicity/persistence 
in the drinking water threat for the watershed (see section 4.1.2.2).
    4.1.3.2.1.1  Toxicity. Assign a toxicity factor value to each 
hazardous substance as specified in section 2.4.1.1.
    4.1.3.2.1.2  Persistence. Assign a persistence factor value to each 
hazardous substance as specified for the drinking water threat (see 
section 4.1.2.2.1.2), except: use the predominant water category (that 
is, lakes; or rivers, oceans, coastal tidal waters, or Great Lakes) 
between the probable point of entry and the nearest fishery (not the 
nearest drinking water or resources intake) along the hazardous 
substance migration path for the watershed to determine which portion of 
Table 4-10 to use. Determine the predominant water category based on 
distance as specified in section 4.1.2.2.1.2. For contaminated sediments 
with no identified source, use the point where measurement begins rather 
than the probable point of entry.
    4.1.3.2.1.3  Bioaccumulation potential. Use the following data 
hierarchy to assign a bioaccumulation potential factor value to each 
hazardous substance:
    <bullet> Bioconcentration factor (BCF) data.
    <bullet> Logarithm of the n-octanol-water partition coefficient (log 
K<INF>ow) data.

[[Page 157]]

    <bullet> Water solubility data.

Assign a bioaccumulation potential factor value to each hazardous 
substance from Table 4-15.
    If BCF data are available for any aquatic human food chain organism 
for the substance being evaluated, assign the bioaccumulation potential 
factor value to the hazardous substance as follows:
    <bullet> If BCF data are available for both fresh water and salt 
water for the hazardous substance, use the BCF data that correspond to 
the type of water body (that is, fresh water or salt water) in which the 
fisheries are located to assign the bioaccumulation potential factor 
value to the hazardous substance.
    <bullet> If, however, some of the fisheries being evaluated are in 
fresh water and some are in salt water, or if any are in brackish water, 
use the BCF data that yield the higher factor value to assign the 
bioaccumulation potential factor value to the hazardous substance.
    <bullet> If BCF data are available for either fresh water or salt 
water, but not for both, use the available BCF data to assign the 
bioaccumulation potential factor value to the hazardous substance.
    If BCF data are not available for the hazardous substance, use log 
K<INF>ow data to assign a bioaccumulation potential factor value to 
organic substances, but not to inorganic substances. If BCF data are not 
available, and if either log K<INF>ow data are not available, the log 
K<INF>ow is available but exceeds 6.0, or the substance is an inorganic 
substance, use water solubility data to assign a bioaccumulation 
potential factor value.

If bioconcentration factor (BCF) data are available for any aquatic 
human food chain organism, assign a value as follows: <SUP>b

                             BCF                                 value

If BCF data are not available, and log K<INF>ow data are available and 
do not exceed 6.0, assign a value to an organic hazardous substance as

to the next):


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do not distinguish between fresh water and salt water in assigning the 
bioaccumulation potential factor value based on log K<INF>ow or water 
solubility data.
    If none of these data are available, assign the hazardous substance 
a bioaccumulation potential factor value of 0.5.
    4.1.3.2.1.4  Calculation of toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation 
factor value. Assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/persistence 
factor value from Table 4-12, based on the values assigned to the 
hazardous substance for the toxicity and persistence factors. Then 
assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation 
factor value from Table 4-16, based on the values assigned for the 
toxicity/persistence and bioaccumulation potential factors. Use the 
hazardous substance with the highest toxicity/persistence/
bioaccumulation factor value for the watershed to assign the value to 
this factor. Enter this value in Table 4-1.

    4.1.3.2.2  Hazardous waste quantity. Assign the same factor value 
for hazardous waste quantity for the watershed as would be assigned in 
section 4.1.2.2.2 for the drinking water threat. Enter this value in 
Table 4-1.
    4.1.3.2.3  Calculation of human food chain threat-waste 
characteristics factor category value. For the hazardous substance 
selected for the watershed in section 4.1.3.2.1.4, use its toxicity/
persistence factor value and bioaccumulation potential factor value as 
follows to assign a value to the waste characteristics factor category. 
First, multiply the toxicity/persistence factor value and the hazardous 
waste quantity factor value for the watershed, subject to a maximum 
product of 1 x 10 \8\. Then multiply this product by the bioaccumulation 
potential factor value for this hazardous substance, subject to a 
maximum product of 1 x 10 \12\. Based on this second product, assign a 
value from Table 2-7 (section 2.4.3.1) to the human food chain threat-
waste characteristics factor category for the watershed. Enter this 
value in Table 4-1.
    4.1.3.3  Human food chain threat-targets. Evaluate two target 
factors for each watershed: food chain individual and population. For 
both factors, determine whether the target fisheries are subject to 
actual or potential human food chain contamination.
    Consider a fishery (or portion of a fishery) within the target 
distance limit of the watershed to be subject to actual human food chain 
contamination if any of the following apply:
    <bullet> A hazardous substance having a bioaccumulation potential 
factor value of 500 or greater is present either in an observed release 
by direct observation to the watershed or in a surface water or sediment 
sample from the watershed at a level that meets the criteria for an 
observed release to the watershed from the site, and at least a portion 
of the fishery is within the boundaries of the observed release (that 
is, it is located either at the point of direct observation or at or 
between the probable point of entry and the most distant sampling point 
establishing the observed release).
    <bullet> The fishery is closed, and a hazardous substance for which 
the fishery has been closed has been documented in an observed release 
to the watershed from the site, and at least a portion of the fishery is 
within the boundaries of the observed release.
    <bullet> A hazardous substance is present in a tissue sample from an 
essentially sessile, benthic, human food chain organism from the 
watershed at a level that meets the criteria for an observed release to 
the watershed from the site, and at least a portion of the fishery is 
within the boundaries of the observed release.

    For a fishery that meets any of these three criteria, but that is 
not wholly within the boundaries of the observed release, consider only 
the portion of the fishery that is within the boundaries of the observed 
release to be subject to actual human food chain contamination. Consider 
the remainder of the fishery  within  the  target  distance  limit  to 
be subject  to  potential  food  chain  contamination.
    In addition, consider all other fisheries that are partially or 
wholly within the target distance limit for the watershed, including 
fisheries partially or wholly within the boundaries of an observed 
release for the watershed that do not meet any of the three criteria 
listed above, to be subject to potential human food chain contamination. 
If only a portion of the fishery is within the target distance limit for 
the watershed, include only that portion in evaluating the targets 
factor category.
    When a fishery (or portion of a fishery) is subject to actual food 
chain contamination, determine the part of the fishery subject to Level 
I concentrations and the part subject to Level II concentrations. If the 
actual food

[[Page 159]]

chain contamination is based on direct observation, evaluate it using 
Level II concentrations. However, if the actual food chain contamination 
is based on samples from the watershed, use these samples and, if 
available, additional tissue samples from aquatic human food chain 
organisms as specified below, to determine the part subject to Level I 
concentrations and the part subject to Level II concentrations:
    <bullet> Determine the level of actual contamination from samples 
(including tissue samples from essentially sessile, benthic organisms) 
that meet the criteria for actual food chain contamination by comparing 
the exposure concentrations (see section 4.1.2.3) from these samples (or 
comparable samples) to the health-based benchmarks from Table 4-17, as 
described in section 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. Use only the exposure 
concentrations for those hazardous substances in the sample (or 
comparable samples) that meet the criteria for actual contamination of 
the fishery.
    <bullet> In addition, determine the level of actual contamination 
from other tissue samples by comparing the concentrations of hazardous 
substances in the tissue samples (or comparable tissue samples) to the 
health-based benchmarks from Table 4-17, as described in sections 2.5.1 
and 2.5.2. Use only those additional tissue samples and only those 
hazardous substances in the tissue samples that meet all the following 
criteria:
-The tissue sample is from a location that is within the boundaries of 
the actual food chain contamination for the site (that is, either at the 
point of direct observation or at or between the probable point of entry 
and the most distant sample point meeting the criteria for actual food 
chain contamination).
-The tissue sample is from a species of aquatic human food chain 
organism that spends extended periods of time within the boundaries of 
the actual food chain contamination for the site and that is not an 
essentially sessile, benthic organism.
-The hazardous substance is a substance that is also present in a 
surface water, benthic, or sediment sample from within the target 
distance limit for the watershed and, for such a sample, meets the 
criteria for actual food chain contamination.

    <bullet> Concentration corresponding to Food and Drug Administration 
Action Level (FDAAL) for fish or shellfish.

    <bullet> Screening concentration for noncancer toxicological 
responses corresponding to the Reference Dose (RfD) for oral exposures.

    4.1.3.3.1  Food chain individual. Evaluate the food chain individual 
factor based on the fisheries (or portions of fisheries) within the 
target distance limit for the watershed. Assign this factor a value as 
follows:
    <bullet> If any fishery (or portion of a fishery) is subject to 
Level I concentrations, assign a value of 50.
    <bullet> If not, but if any fishery (or portion of a fishery) is 
subject to Level II concentrations, assign a value of 45.
    <bullet> If not, but if there is an observed release of a hazardous 
substance having a bioaccumulation potential factor value of 500 or 
greater to surface water in the watershed and there is a fishery (or 
portion of a fishery) present anywhere within the target distance limit, 
assign a value of 20.
    <bullet> If there is no observed release to surface water in the 
watershed or there is no observed release of a hazardous substance 
having a bioaccumulation potential factor value of 500 or greater, but 
there is a fishery (or portion of a fishery) present anywhere within the 
target distance limit, assign a value as follows:

-Using Table 4-13, determine the highest dilution weight (that is, 
lowest amount of dilution) applicable to the fisheries (or portions of 
fisheries) within the target distance limit. Multiply this dilution 
weight by 20 and round to the nearest integer.
-Assign this calculated value as the factor value.

    <bullet> If there are no fisheries (or portions of fisheries) within 
the target distance limit of the watershed, assign a value of 0.

    Enter the value assigned in Table 4-1.
    4.1.3.3.2  Population. Evaluate the population factor for the 
watershed based on three factors: Level I concentrations, Level II 
concentrations, and potential human food chain contamination. Determine 
which factor applies for a fishery (or portion of a fishery) as 
specified in section 4.1.3.3.
    4.1.3.3.2.1  Level I concentrations. Determine those fisheries (or 
portions of fisheries) within the watershed that are subject to Level I 
concentrations.
    Estimate the human food chain population value for each fishery (or 
portion of a fishery) as follows:
    <bullet> Estimate human food chain production for the fishery based 
on the estimated annual production (in pounds) of human food chain 
organisms (for example, fish, shellfish) for that fishery, except: if 
the fishery is closed and a hazardous substance for which the fishery 
has been closed has been documented in an observed release to the 
fishery from a source at the site, use the estimated

[[Page 160]]

annual production for the period prior to closure of the fishery or use 
the estimated annual production from comparable fisheries that are not 
closed.
    <bullet> Assign the fishery a value for human food chain population 
from Table 4-18, based on the estimated human food production for the 
fishery.
    <bullet> Set boundaries between fisheries at those points where 
human food chain production changes or where the surface water dilution 
weight changes.

    Sum the human food chain population value for each fishery (and

than 1, do not round it to the nearest integer; if 1 or more, round to 
the nearest integer. Assign the resulting value as the Level I 
concentrations factor value. Enter this value in Table 4-1.
    4.1.3.3.2.2  Level II concentrations. Determine those fisheries (or 
portions of fisheries) within the watershed that are subject to Level II 
concentrations. Do not include any fisheries (or portions of fisheries) 
already counted under the Level I concentrations factor.
    Assign each fishery (or portion of a fishery) a value for human food 
chain population from Table 4-18, based on the estimated human food 
production for the fishery. Estimate the human food chain production for 
the fishery as specified in section 4.1.3.3.2.1.
    Sum the human food chain population value for each fishery (and 
portion of a fishery). If this sum is less than 1, do not round it to 
the nearest integer; if 1 or more, round to the nearest integer. Assign 
the resulting value as the Level II concentrations factor value. Enter 
this value in Table 4-1.

    4.1.3.3.2.3  Potential human food chain contamination. Determine 
those fisheries (or portions of fisheries) within the watershed that are 
subject to potential human food chain contamination. Do not include 
those fisheries (or portion of fisheries) already counted under the 
Level I or Level II concentrations factors.
    Calculate the value for the potential human food chain contamination 
factor (PF) for the watershed as follows:

  .....................  1    n                                         
PF =...................  --   <greek-S>  P<INF>i D<INF>i                          
  .....................  10  i=1                                        
                                                                        

where:

P<INF>i=Human food chain population value for fishery i.
D<INF>i=Dilution weight from Table 4-13 for fishery i.
n=Number of fisheries subject to potential human food chain 
          contamination.
    In calculating PF:
    <bullet> Estimate the human food chain population value (P<INF>i) 
for a fishery (or portion of a fishery) as specified in section 
4.1.3.3.2.1.
    <bullet> Assign the fishery (or portion of a fishery) a dilution 
weight as indicated in Table 4-13 (section 4.1.2.3.1), except: do not 
assign a dilution weight of 0.5 for a ``3-mile mixing zone in quiet 
flowing river''; instead assign a dilution weight based on the average 
annual flow.

    If PF is less than 1, do not round it to the nearest integer; if PF 
is 1 or more, round to the nearest integer. Enter the value assigned in 
Table 4-1.
    4.1.3.3.2.4  Calculation of population factor value. Sum the values 
for the Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, and potential 
human food chain contamination factors for the watershed. Do not round 
this sum to the nearest integer. Assign it as the population factor 
value for the watershed. Enter this value in Table 4-1.
    4.1.3.3.3  Calculation of human food chain threat-targets factor 
category value. Sum the food chain individual and population factor 
values for the watershed. Do not round this sum to the nearest integer. 
Assign it as the human food chain threat-targets factor category value 
for the watershed. Enter this value in Table 4-1.
    4.1.3.4  Calculation of human food chain threat score for a 
watershed. Multiply the human food chain threat factor category values 
for likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets for the 
watershed, and round the product to the nearest integer. Then divide by 
82,500. Assign the resulting value, subject to a maximum of 100, as the 
human food chain threat score for the watershed. Enter this score in 
Table 4-1.
    4.1.4  Environmental threat. Evaluate the environmental threat for 
the watershed based on three factor categories: likelihood of release, 
waste characteristics, and targets.
    4.1.4.1  Environmental threat-likelihood of release. Assign the same 
likelihood of release factor category value for the environmental threat 
for the watershed as would be assigned in section 4.1.2.1.3 for the 
drinking water threat. Enter this value in Table 4-1.

[[Page 161]]

    4.1.4.2  Environmental threat-waste characteristics. Evaluate the 
waste characteristics factor category for each watershed based on two 
factors: ecosystem toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation and hazardous 
waste quantity.
    4.1.4.2.1  Ecosystem toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation. Evaluate 
all those hazardous substances eligible to be evaluated for toxicity/
persistence in the drinking water threat for the watershed (see
section 4.1.2.2).
    4.1.4.2.1.1  Ecosystem toxicity. Assign an ecosystem toxicity factor 
value from Table 4-19 to each hazardous substance on the basis of the 
following data hierarchy:
    <bullet> EPA chronic Ambient Water Quality Criterion (AWQC) for the 
substance.
    <bullet> EPA chronic Ambient Aquatic Life Advisory Concentrations 
(AALAC) for the substance.
    <bullet> EPA acute AWQC for the substance.
    <bullet> EPA acute AALAC for the substance.
    <bullet> Lowest LC<INF>50 value for the substance.
    In assigning the ecosystem toxicity factor value to the hazardous 
substance:
    <bullet> If either an EPA chronic AWQC or AALAC is available for the 
hazardous substance, use it to assign the ecosystem toxicity factor 
value. Use the chronic AWQC in preference to the chronic AALAC when both 
are available.
    <bullet> If neither is available, use the EPA acute AWQC or AALAC to 
assign the ecosystem toxicity factor value. Use the acute AWQC in 
preference to the acute AALAC.
    <bullet> If none of the chronic and acute AWQCs and AALACs is 
available, use the lowest LC<INF>50 value to assign the ecosystem 
toxicity factor value.
    <bullet> If an LC<INF>50 value is also not available, assign an 
ecosystem toxicity factor value of 0 to the hazardous substance and use 
other hazardous substances for which data are available in evaluating 
the pathway.

    If an ecosystem toxicity factor value of 0 is assigned to all 
hazardous substances eligible to be evaluated for the watershed (that 
is, insufficient data are available for evaluating all the substances), 
use a default value of 100 as the ecosystem toxicity factor value for 
all these hazardous substances.
    With regard to the AWQC, AALAC, or LC<INF>50 selected for assigning 
the ecosystem toxicity factor value to the hazardous substance:
    <bullet> If values for the selected AWQC, AALAC, or LC<INF>50 are 
available for both fresh water and marine water for the hazardous 
substance, use the value that corresponds to the type of water body 
(that is, fresh water or salt water) in which the sensitive environments 
are located to assign the ecosystem toxicity factor value to the 
hazardous substance.
    <bullet> If, however, some of the sensitive environments being 
evaluated are in fresh water and some are in salt water, or if any are 
in brackish water, use the value (fresh water or marine) that yields the 
higher factor value to assign the ecosystem toxicity factor value to the 
hazardous substance.
    <bullet> If a value for the selected AWQC, AALAC, or LC<INF>50 is 
available for either fresh water or marine water, but not for both, use 
the available one to assign an ecosystem toxicity factor value to the 
hazardous substance.

    4.1.4.2.1.2  Persistence. Assign a persistence factor value to each 
hazardous substance as specified in section 4.1.2.2.1.2, except: use the 
predominant water category (that is lakes; or rivers, oceans, coastal 
tidal waters, or Great Lakes) between the probable point of entry and 
the nearest sensitive environment (not the nearest drinking water or 
resources intake) along the hazardous substance migration path for the 
watershed to determine

[[Page 162]]

which portion of Table 4-10 to use. Determine the predominant water 
category based on distance as specified in section 4.1.2.2.1.2. For 
contaminated sediments with no identified source, use the point where 
measurement begins rather than the probable point of entry.
    4.1.4.2.1.3  Ecosystem bioaccumulation potential. Assign an 
ecosystem bioaccumulation potential factor value to each hazardous 
substance in the same manner specified for the bioaccumulation potential 
factor in section 4.1.3.2.1.3, except:
    <bullet> Use BCF data for all aquatic organisms, not just for 
aquatic human food chain organisms.
    <bullet> Use the BCF data that corresponds to the type of water body 
(that is, fresh water or salt water) in which the sensitive environments 
(not fisheries) are located.
    4.1.4.2.1.4  Calculation of ecosystem toxicity/persistence/
bioaccumulation factor value. Assign each hazardous substance an 
ecosystem toxicity/persistence factor value from Table 4-20, based on 
the values assigned to the hazardous substance for the ecosystem 
toxicity and persistence factors. Then assign each hazardous substance 
an ecosystem toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value from 
Table 4-21, based on the values assigned for the ecosystem toxicity/
persistence and ecosystem bioaccumulation potential factors. Select the 
hazardous substance with the highest ecosystem toxicity/persistence/
bioaccumulation factor value for the watershed and use it to assign the 
value to this factor. Enter this value in Table 4-1.

    4.1.4.3  Environmental threat-targets. Evaluate the environmental 
threat-targets factor category for a watershed using one factor: 
sensitive environments.
    4.1.4.3.1  Sensitive environments. Evaluate sensitive environments 
along the hazardous substance migration path for the watershed based on 
three factors: Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, and 
potential contamination.
    Determine which factor applies to each sensitive environment as 
specified in section 4.1.2.3, except: use ecological-based benchmarks 
(Table 4-22) rather than health-based benchmarks (Table 3-10) in 
determining the level of contamination from samples. In determining the 
level of actual contamination, use a point of direct observation 
anywhere within the sensitive environment or samples (that is, surface 
water, benthic, or sediment samples) taken anywhere within or beyond the 
sensitive environment (or anywhere adjacent to or beyond the sensitive 
environment if it is contiguous to the migration path).
    4.1.4.3.1.1  Level I concentrations. Assign value(s) from Table 4-23 
to each sensitive environment subject to Level I concentrations.
    For those sensitive environments that are wetlands, assign an 
additional value from Table 4-24. In assigning a value from Table 4-24, 
include only those portions of wetlands located along the hazardous 
substance migration path in the area of Level I concentrations. If a 
wetland is located partially along the area of Level I concentrations 
and partially along the area of Level II concentrations and/or potential 
contamination, then solely for purposes of Table 4-24, count the 
portion(s) along the areas of Level II concentrations or potential 
contamination under the Level II concentrations factor (section 
4.1.4.3.1.2) or potential contamination factor (section 4.1.4.3.1.3), as 
appropriate.
    Estimate the total length of wetlands along the hazardous substance 
migration path (that is, wetland frontage) in the area of Level I 
concentrations and assign a value from Table 4-24 based on this total 
length. Estimate this length as follows:
    <bullet> For an isolated wetland or for a wetland where the probable 
point of entry to surface water is in the wetland, use the perimeter of 
that portion of the wetland subject to Level I concentrations as the 
length.
    <bullet> For rivers, use the length of the wetlands contiguous to 
the in-water segment of the hazardous substance migration path (that is, 
wetland frontage).
    <bullet> For lakes, oceans, coastal tidal waters, and Great Lakes, 
use the length of the wetlands along the shoreline within the target 
distance limit (that is, wetland frontage along the shoreline).
    Calculate the Level I concentrations factor value (SH) for the 
watershed as follows:

  .....................   n                                             
SH = 10  ( WH +........   <greek-S>  S<INF>i )                               
  .....................  i=1                                            
                                                                        

where:

WH=Value assigned from Table 4-24 to wetlands along the area of Level I 
          concentrations.
S<INF>i=Value(s) assigned from Table 4-23 to sensitive environment i.
n=Number of sensitive environments from Table 4-23 subject to Level I 
          concentrations.

    Enter the value assigned in Table 4-1.
    4.1.4.3.1.2  Level II concentrations. Assign value(s) from Table 4-
23 to each sensitive environment subject to Level II concentrations. Do 
not include sensitive environments already counted for Table 4-23 under 
the Level I concentrations factor for this watershed.
    For those sensitive environments that are wetlands, assign an 
additional value from Table 4-24. In assigning a value from Table 4-24, 
include only those portions of wetlands located along the hazardous 
substance migration path in the area of Level II concentrations, as 
specified in section 4.1.4.3.1.1.
    Estimate the total length of wetlands along the hazardous substance 
migration path (that is, wetland frontage) in the area of Level II 
concentrations and assign a value from Table 4-24 based on this total 
length. Estimate this length as specified in section 4.1.4.3.1.1, 
except: for an isolated wetland or for a wetland where the probable 
point of entry to surface water is in the wetland, use the perimeter of 
that portion of the wetland subject to Level II (not Level I) 
concentrations as the length.
    Calculate the Level II concentrations value (SL) for the watershed 
as follows:

  .....................   n                                             
SL = WL +..............   <greek-S>  S<INF>i                                 
  .....................  i=1                                            
                                                                        

where:


[[Page 165]]


WL=Value assigned from Table 4-24 to wetlands along the area of Level II 
          concentrations.
S<INF>i=Value(s) assigned from Table 4-23 to sensitive environment i.
n=Number of sensitive environments from Table 4-23 subject to Level II 
          concentrations.

    Enter the value assigned in Table 4-1.
    4.1.4.3.1.3  Potential contamination. Assign value(s) from Table 4-
23 to each sensitive environment subject to potential contamination. Do 
not include sensitive environments already counted for Table 4-23 under 
the Level I or Level II concentrations factors.
    For each type of surface water body in Table 4-13 (section 
4.1.2.3.1), sum the value(s) assigned from Table 4-23 to the sensitive 
environments along that type of surface water body, except: do not use 
the surface water body type ``3-mile mixing zone in quiet flowing 
river.'' If a sensitive environment is along two or more types of 
surface water bodies (for example, Wildlife Refuge contiguous to both a 
moderate stream and a large river), assign the sensitive environment 
only to that surface water body type having the highest dilution weight 
value from Table 4-13.
    For those sensitive environments that are wetlands, assign an 
additional value from Table 4-24. In assigning a value from Table 4-24, 
include only those portions of wetlands located along the hazardous 
substance migration path in the area of potential contamination, as 
specified in section 4.1.4.3.1.1. Aggregate these wetlands by type of 
surface water body, except: do not use the surface water body type ``3-
mile mixing zone in quiet flowing river.'' Treat the wetlands aggregated 
within each type of surface water body as separate sensitive 
environments solely for purposes of applying Table 4-24. Estimate the 
total length of the wetlands within each surface water body type as 
specified in section 4.1.4.3.1.1, except: for an isolated wetland or for 
a wetland where the probable point of entry to surface water is in the 
wetland, use the perimeter of that portion of the wetland subject to 
potential contamination (or the portion of that perimeter that is within 
the target distance limit) as the length. Assign a separate value from 
Table 4-24 for each type of surface water body in the watershed.
    Calculate the potential contamination factor value (SP) for the 
watershed as follows:

  .....................  1    m                                         
SP =...................  --  <greek-S>( [W<INF>j+S<INF>j] D<INF>j )                    
  .....................  10  j=1                                        
                                                                        

where:

       n
S<INF>j =  <greek-S> S<INF>i j
      i=1
S<INF>ij=Value(s) assigned from Table 4-23 to sensitive environment i in 
          surface water body type j.
n=Number of sensitive environments from Table 4-23 subject to potential 
          contamination.
W<INF>j=Value assigned from Table 4-24 for wetlands along the area of 
          potential contamination in surface water body type j.
D<INF>j=Dilution weight from Table 4-13 for surface water body type j.
m=Number of different surface water body types from Table 4-13 in the 
          watershed.

    If SP is less than 1, do not round it to the nearest integer; if SP 
is 1 or more, round to the nearest integer. Enter this value for the 
potential contamination factor in Table 4-1.
    4.1.4.3.1.4  Calculation of environmental threat-targets factor 
category value. Sum the values for the Level I concentrations, Level II 
concentrations, and potential contamination factors for the watershed. 
Do not round this sum to the nearest integer. Assign this sum as the 
environmental threat-targets factor category value for the watershed. 
Enter this value in Table 4-1.
    4.1.4.4  Calculation of environmental threat score for a watershed. 
Multiply the environmental threat factor category values for likelihood 
of release, waste characteristics, and targets for the watershed, and 
round the product to the nearest integer. Then divide by 82,500. Assign 
the resulting value, subject to a maximum of 60, as the environmental 
threat score for the watershed. Enter this score in Table 4-1.
    4.1.5  Calculation of overland/flood migration component score for a 
watershed. Sum the scores for the three threats for the watershed (that 
is, drinking water, human food chain, and environmental threats). Assign 
the resulting score, subject to a maximum value of 100, as the surface 
water overland/flood migration component score for the watershed. Enter 
this score in Table 4-1.
    4.1.6  Calculation of overland/flood migration component score. 
Select the highest surface water overland/flood migration component 
score from the watersheds evaluated. Assign this score as the surface 
water overland/flood migration component score for the site, subject to 
a maximum score of 100. Enter this score in Table 4-1.
    4.2  Ground water to surface water migration component. Use the 
ground water to surface water migration component to evaluate surface 
water threats that result from migration of hazardous substances from a 
source at the site to surface water via ground water. Evaluate three 
types of threats for this component: drinking water threat, human food 
chain threat, and environmental threat.
    4.2.1  General considerations.
    4.2.1.1  Eligible surface waters. Calculate ground water to surface 
water migration component scores only for surface waters

[[Page 166]]

(see section 4.0.2) for which all the following conditions are met:
    <bullet> A portion of the surface water is within 1 mile of one or 
more sources at the site having a containment factor value greater than 
0 (see section 4.2.2.1.2).
    <bullet> No aquifer discontinuity is established between the source 
and the portion of the surface water within 1 mile of the source (see 
section 3.0.1.2.2). However, if hazardous substances have migrated 
across an apparent discontinuity within this 1 mile distance, do not 
consider a discontinuity present in scoring the site.
    <bullet> The top of the uppermost aquifer is at or above the bottom 
of the surface water.

    Do not evaluate this component for sites consisting solely of 
contaminated sediments with no identified source.
    4.2.1.2  Definition of hazardous substance migration path for ground 
water to surface water migration component. The hazardous substance 
migration path includes both the ground water segment and the surface 
water in-water segment that hazardous substances would take as they 
migrate away from sources at the site:
    <bullet> Restrict the ground water segment to migration via the 
uppermost aquifer between a source and the surface water.
    <bullet> Begin the surface water in-water segment at the probable 
point of entry from the uppermost aquifer to the surface water. Identify 
the probable point of entry as that point of the surface water that 
yields the shortest straight-line distance, within the aquifer boundary 
(see section 3.0.1.2), from the sources at the site with a containment 
factor value greater than 0 to the surface water.

-For rivers, continue the in-water segment in the direction of flow 
(including any tidal flows) for the distance established by the target 
distance limit (see section 4.2.1.4).
-For lakes, oceans, coastal tidal waters, or Great Lakes, do not 
consider flow direction. Instead apply the target distance limit as an 
arc.
-If the in-water segment includes both rivers and lakes (or oceans, 
coastal tidal waters, or Great Lakes), apply the target distance limit 
to their combined in-water segments.

    Consider a site to be in two or more watersheds for this component 
if two or more hazardous substance migration paths from the sources at 
the site do not reach a common point within the target distance limit. 
If the site is in more than one watershed, define a separate hazardous 
substance migration path for each watershed. Evaluate the ground water 
to surface water migration component for each watershed separately as 
specified in section 4.2.1.5.
    4.2.1.3  Observed release of a specific hazardous substance to 
surface water in-water segment. Section 4.2.2.1.1 specifies the criteria 
for assigning values to the observed release factor for the ground water 
to surface water migration component. With regard to an individual 
hazardous substance, consider an observed release of that hazardous 
substance to be established for the surface water in-water segment of 
the ground water to surface water migration component only when the 
hazardous substance meets the criteria both for an observed release both 
to ground water (see section 4.2.2.1.1) and for an observed release by 
chemical analysis to surface water (see section 4.1.2.1.1).
    If the hazardous substance meets the section 4.1.2.1.1 criteria for 
an observed release by chemical analysis to surface water but does not 
also meet the criteria for an observed release to ground water, do not 
use any samples of that hazardous substance from the surface water in-
water segment in evaluating the factors of this component (for example, 
do not use the hazardous substance in establishing targets subject to 
actual contamination or in determining the level of actual contamination 
for a target).
    4.2.1.4  Target distance limit. Determine the target distance limit 
for each watershed as specified in section 4.1.1.2, except: do not 
extend the target distance limit to a sample location beyond 15 miles 
unless at least one hazardous substance in a sample from that location 
meets the criteria in section 4.2.1.3 for an observed release to the 
surface water in-water segment.
    Determine the targets eligible to be evaluated for each watershed 
and establish whether these targets are subject to actual or potential 
contamination as specified in section 4.1.1.2, except: do not establish 
actual contamination based on a sample location unless at least one 
hazardous substance in a sample from that location meets the criteria in 
section 4.2.1.3 for an observed release to the surface water in-water 
segment.
    4.2.1.5  Evaluation of ground water to surface water migration 
component. Evaluate the drinking water threat, human food chain threat, 
and environmental threat for each watershed for this component based on 
three factor categories: likelihood of release, waste characteristics, 
and targets. Figure 4-2 indicates the factors included within each 
factor category for each type of threat.

    Determine the ground water to surface water migration component 
score (S<INF>gs) for a watershed in terms of the factor category values 
as follows:

                                                        3

                                                       i=1                                                      
                                                 S<INF>gs=  ----------------------                                   
                                                                       SF                                       
                                                                                                                

where:

LR<INF>i=Likelihood of release factor category value for threat i (that 
          is, drinking water, human food chain, or environmental 
          threat).
WC<INF>i=Waste characteristics factor category value for threat i.
T<INF>i=Targets factor category value for threat i.
SF=Scaling factor.

Table 4-25 outlines the specific calculation procedure.

    If the site is in only one watershed, assign the ground water to 
surface water migration component score for that watershed as the ground 
water to surface water migration component score for the site.
    If the site is in more than one watershed:

    <bullet> Calculate a separate ground water to surface water 
migration component score for each watershed, using likelihood of 
release, waste characteristics, and targets applicable to each 
watershed.
    <bullet> Select the highest ground water to surface water migration 
component score from the watersheds evaluated and assign it as the 
ground water to surface water migration component score for the site.

    4.2.2  Drinking water threat. Evaluate the drinking water threat for 
each watershed based on three factor categories: likelihood of release, 
waste characteristics, and targets.
    4.2.2.1  Drinking water threat-likelihood of release. Evaluate the 
likelihood of release factor category for each watershed in terms of an 
observed release factor or a potential to release factor.
    4.2.2.1.1  Observed release. Establish an observed release to the 
uppermost aquifer as specified in section 3.1.1. If an observed release 
can be established for the uppermost aquifer, assign an observed release 
factor value of 550 to that watershed, enter this value in Table 4-25, 
and proceed to section 4.2.2.1.3. If no observed release can be 
established, assign an observed release factor value of 0, enter this 
value in Table
4-25, and proceed to section 4.2.2.1.2.
    4.2.2.1.2  Potential to release. Evaluate potential to release only 
if an observed release cannot be established for the uppermost aquifer. 
Calculate a potential to release value for the uppermost aquifer as 
specified in section 3.1.2 and sections 3.1.2.1 through 3.1.2.5. Assign 
the potential to release value for the uppermost aquifer as the 
potential to release factor value for the watershed. Enter this value in 
Table 4-25.
    4.2.2.1.3  Calculation of drinking water threat-likelihood of 
release factor category value. If an observed release is established for 
the uppermost aquifer, assign the observed release factor value of 550 
as the likelihood of release factor category value for the watershed. 
Otherwise, assign the potential to release factor value as the 
likelihood of release factor category value for the watershed. Enter the 
value assigned in Table 4-25.
    4.2.2.2  Drinking water threat-waste characteristics. Evaluate the 
waste characteristics factor category for each watershed based on two 
factors: toxicity/mobility/persistence and hazardous waste quantity. 
Evaluate only those hazardous substances available to migrate from the 
sources at the site to the uppermost aquifer (see section 3.2). Such 
hazardous substances include:
    <bullet> Hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed 
release to ground water.
    <bullet> All hazardous substances associated with a source that has 
a ground water containment factor value greater than 0 (see sections 
2.2.2, 2.2.3, and 3.1.2.1).
    4.2.2.2.1  Toxicity/mobility/persistence. For each hazardous 
substance, assign a toxicity factor value, a mobility factor value, a 
persistence factor value, and a combined toxicity/mobility/persistence 
factor value as specified in sections 4.2.2.2.1.1 through 4.2.2.2.1.4.
    4.2.2.2.1.1  Toxicity. Assign a toxicity factor value to each 
hazardous substance as specified in section 2.4.1.1.
    4.2.2.2.1.2  Mobility. Assign a ground water mobility factor value 
to each hazardous substance as specified in section 3.2.1.2.
    4.2.2.2.1.3  Persistence. Assign a surface water persistence factor 
value to each hazardous substance as specified in section 4.1.2.2.1.2.

[[Page 170]]

    4.2.2.2.1.4  Calculation of toxicity/mobility/persistence factor 
value. First, assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/mobility factor 
value from Table 3-9 (section 3.2.1.3), based on the values assigned to 
the hazardous substance for the toxicity and mobility factors. Then 
assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/mobility/persistence factor 
value from Table 4-26, based on the values assigned for the toxicity/
mobility and persistence factors. Use the substance with the highest 
toxicity/mobility/ persistence factor value for the watershed to assign 
the value to this factor. Enter this value in Table 4-25.
    4.2.2.2.2  Hazardous waste quantity. Assign the same factor value 
for hazardous waste quantity for the watershed as would be assigned for 
the uppermost aquifer in section 3.2.2. Enter this value in Table 4-25.
    4.2.2.2.3  Calculation of drinking water threat-waste 
characteristics factor category value. Multiply the toxicity/mobility/
persistence and hazardous waste quantity factor values for the 
watershed, subject to a maximum product of 1 x 10<SUP>8. Based on this 
product, assign a value from Table 2-7 (section 2.4.3.1) to the drinking 
water threat-waste characteristics factor category for the watershed. 
Enter this value in Table 4-25.
    4.2.2.3  Drinking water threat-targets. Evaluate the targets factor 
category for each watershed based on three factors: nearest intake, 
population, and resources.

<SUP>aDo not round to nearest integer.                                                                               

    For the nearest intake and population factors, determine whether the 
target surface water intakes are subject to actual or potential 
contamination as specified in section 4.1.1.2, subject to the 
restrictions specified in sections 4.2.1.3 and 4.2.1.4.
    When the intake is subject to actual contamination, evaluate it 
using Level I concentrations or Level II concentrations. Determine which 
level applies for the intake by comparing the exposure concentrations 
from a sample (or comparable samples) to health-based benchmarks as 
specified in section 4.1.2.3, except use only those samples from the 
surface water in-water segment and only those hazardous substances in 
such samples that meet the conditions in sections 4.2.1.3 and 4.2.1.4.
    4.2.2.3.1  Nearest intake. Assign a value to the nearest intake 
factor as specified in section 4.1.2.3.1 with the following 
modification. For the intake being evaluated, multiply its dilution 
weight from Table 4-13 (section 4.1.2.3.1) by a value selected from 
Table 4-27. Use the resulting product, not the value from Table 4-13, as 
the dilution weight for the intake for the ground water to surface water 
component. Do not round this product to the nearest integer.
    Select the value from Table 4-27 based on the angle <greek-THC>, the 
angle defined by the sources at the site and either the two points at 
the intersection of the surface water body and the 1-mile distance ring 
of any two other points of the surface water body within the 1-mile 
distance ring, whichever results in the largest angle. (See Figure 4-3 
for an example of how to determine <greek-THC>.) If the surface water 
body does not extend to the 1-mile ring at one or both ends, define 
<greek-THC> using the surface

water endpoint(s) within the 1-mile ring or any two other points of the 
surface water body within the 1-mile distance ring, whichever results in 
the largest angle.

    4.2.4.2.2  Hazardous waste quantity. Assign the same factor value 
for hazardous waste quantity for the watershed as would be assigned in 
section 4.2.2.2.2 for the drinking water threat. Enter this value in 
Table 4-25.
    4.2.4.2.3  Calculation of environmental threat-waste characteristics 
factor category value. For the hazardous substance selected for the 
watershed in section 4.2.4.2.1.5, use its ecosystem toxicity/mobility/
persistence factor value and ecosystem bioaccumulation potential factor 
value as follows to assign a value to the waste characteristics factor 
category. First, multiply the ecosystem toxicity/mobility/persistence 
factor value and the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the 
watershed, subject to a maximum product of 1 x 10<SUP>8. Then multiply 
this product by the ecosystem bioaccumulation potential factor value for 
this hazardous substance, subject to a maximum product of 1 x 10<SUP>12. 
Based on this product, assign a value from Table 2-7 (section 2.4.3.1) 
to the environmental threat-waste characteristics category for the 
watershed. Enter the value in Table 4-25.
    4.2.4.3  Environmental threat-targets. Evaluate the environmental 
threat-targets factor category for a watershed using one factor: 
sensitive environments.
    4.2.4.3.1  Sensitive environments. Evaluate sensitive environments 
for the watershed based on three factors: Level I concentrations, Level 
II concentrations, and potential contamination. Determine which applies 
to each sensitive environment as specified in section 4.1.4.3.1, except: 
use only those samples from the surface water in-water segment and only 
those hazardous substances in such samples that meet the conditions in 
sections 4.2.1.3 and 4.2.1.4.
    4.2.4.3.1.1  Level I concentrations. Assign a value to this factor 
as specified in section 4.1.4.3.1.1. Enter this value in Table 4-25.
    4.2.4.3.1.2  Level II concentrations. Assign a value to this factor 
as specified in section 4.1.4.3.1.2. Enter this value in Table 4-25.
    4.2.4.3.1.3  Potential contamination. Assign a value to this factor 
as specified in section 4.1.4.3.1.3 with the following modification. 
Multiply the appropriate dilution weight from Table 4-13 for the 
sensitive environments in each type of surface water body by the 
adjustment value selected from Table 4-27, as specified in section 
4.2.2.3.1. Use the resulting product, not the value from Table 4-13, as 
the dilution weight for the sensitive environments in that type of 
surface water body. Do not round this product to the nearest integer. 
Enter the value assigned in Table 4-25.
    4.2.4.3.1.4  Calculation of environmental threat-targets factor 
category value. Sum the values for Level I concentrations, Level II 
concentrations, and potential contamination for the watershed. Do not 
round this sum to the nearest integer. Assign this sum as the 
environmental threat targets factor category value for the watershed. 
Enter this value in Table 4-25.
    4.2.4.4  Calculation of environmental threat score for a watershed. 
Multiply the environmental threat factor category values for likelihood 
of release, waste characteristics, and targets for the watershed, and 
round the product to the nearest integer. Then divide by 82,500. Assign 
the resulting value, subject to a maximum of 60, as the environmental 
threat score for the watershed. Enter this score in Table 4-25.
    4.2.5  Calculation of ground water to surface water migration 
component score for a watershed. Sum the scores for the three threats 
for the watershed (that is, drinking water, human food chain, and 
environmental threats). Assign the resulting score, subject to a maximum 
value of 100, as the ground water to surface water migration component 
score for the watershed. Enter this score in Table 4-25.
    4.2.6  Calculation of ground water to surface water migration 
component score. Select the highest ground water to surface water 
migration component score from the watersheds evaluated. Assign this 
score as the ground water to surface water migration component score for 
the site, subject to a maximum score of 100. Enter this score in Table 
4-25.
    4.3  Calculation of surface water migration pathway score. Determine 
the surface water migration pathway score as follows:
    <bullet> If only one of the two surface water migration components 
(overland/flood or ground water to surface water) is scored, assign the 
score of that component as the surface water migration pathway score.
    <bullet> If both components are scored, select the higher of the two 
component scores from sections 4.1.6 and 4.2.6. Assign that score as the 
surface water migration pathway score.

                       5.0  Soil Exposure Pathway

    Evaluate the soil exposure pathway based on two threats: Resident 
population threat and nearby population threat. Evaluate both threats 
based on three factor categories: Likelihood of exposure, waste 
characteristics, and targets. Figure 5-1 indicates the factors included 
within each factor category for each type of threat.
    Determine the soil exposure pathway score (S<INF>s)in terms of the 
factor category values as follows:

    5.0.1  General considerations. Evaluate the soil exposure pathway 
based on areas of observed contamination:
    <bullet> Consider observed contamination to be present at sampling 
locations where analytic evidence indicates that:

-A hazardous substance attributable to the site is present at a 
concentration significantly above background levels for the site (see 
Table 2-3 in section 2.3 for the criteria for determining analytical 
significance), and 
-This hazardous substance, if not present at the surface, is covered by 
2 feet or less of cover material (for example, soil).

    <bullet> Establish areas of observed contamination based on sampling 
locations at which there is observed contamination as follows:

-For all sources except contaminated soil, if observed contamination 
from the site is present at any sampling location within the source, 
consider that entire source to be an area of observed contamination.
-For contaminated soil, consider both the sampling location(s) with 
observed contamination from the site and the area lying between such 
locations to be an area of observed contamination, unless available 
information indicates otherwise.

    <bullet> If an area of observed contamination (or portion of such an 
area) is covered by a permanent, or otherwise maintained, essentially 
impenetrable material (for example, asphalt) that is not more than 2 
feet thick, exclude that area (or portion of the area) in evaluating the 
soil exposure pathway.
    <bullet> For an area of observed contamination, consider only those 
hazardous substances that meet the criteria for observed contamination 
for that area to be associated with that area in evaluating the soil 
exposure pathway (see section 2.2.2).

[[Page 182]]

    If there is observed contamination, assign scores for the resident 
population threat and the nearby population threat, as specified in 
sections 5.1 and 5.2. If there is no observed contamination, assign the 
soil exposure pathway a score of 0.
    5.1  Resident Population Threat. Evaluate the resident population 
threat only if there is an area of observed contamination in one or more 
of the following locations:
    <bullet> Within the property boundary of a residence, school, or day 
care center and within 200 feet of the respective residence, school, or 
day care center, or
    <bullet> Within a workplace property boundary and within 200 feet of 
a workplace area, or
    <bullet> Within the boundaries of a resource specified in section 
5.1.3.4, or
    <bullet> Within the boundaries of a terrestrial sensitive 
environment specified in section 5.1.3.5.

    If not, assign the resident population threat a value of 0, enter 
this value in Table 5-1, and proceed to the nearby population threat 
(section 5.2).
    5.1.1  Likelihood of exposure. Assign a value of 550 to the 
likelihood of exposure factor category for the resident population 
threat if there is an area of observed contamination in one or more 
locations listed in section 5.1. Enter this value in Table 5-1.
    5.1.2  Waste characteristics. Evaluate waste characteristics based 
on two factors: toxicity and hazardous waste quantity. Evaluate only 
those hazardous substances that meet the criteria for observed 
contamination at the site (see section 5.0.1).
    5.1.2.1  Toxicity. Assign a toxicity factor value to each hazardous 
substance as specified in section 2.4.1.1. Use the hazardous substance 
with the highest toxicity factor value to assign the value to the 
toxicity factor for the resident population threat. Enter this value in 
Table 5-1.
    5.1.2.2  Hazardous waste quantity. Assign a hazardous waste quantity 
factor value as specified in section 2.4.2. In estimating the hazardous 
waste quantity, use Table 5-2 and:
    <bullet> Consider only the first 2 feet of depth of an area of 
observed contamination, except as specified for the volume measure.
    <bullet> Use the volume measure (see section 2.4.2.1.3) only for 
those types of areas of observed contamination listed in Tier C of Table 
5-2. In evaluating the volume measure for these listed areas of observed 
contamination, use the full volume, not just the volume within the top 2 
feet.
    <bullet> Use the area measure (see section 2.4.2.1.4), not the 
volume measure, for all other types of areas of observed contamination, 
even if their volume is known.

    Enter the value assigned in Table 5-1.

    5.1.2.3  Calculation of waste characteristics factor category value. 
Multiply the toxicity and hazardous waste quantity factor values, 
subject to a maximum product of 1  x  10\8\. Based on this product, 
assign a value from Table 2-7 (section 2.4.3.1) to the waste 
characteristics factor category. Enter this value in Table 5-1.
    5.1.3  Targets. Evaluate the targets factor category for the 
resident population threat based on five factors: resident individual, 
resident population, workers, resources, and terrestrial sensitive 
environments.
    In evaluating the targets factor category for the resident 
population threat, count only the following as targets:
    <bullet> Resident individual--a person living or attending school or 
day care on a property with an area of observed contamination and whose 
residence, school, or day care center, respectively, is on or within 200 
feet of the area of observed contamination.
    <bullet> Worker--a person working on a property with an area of 
observed contamination and whose workplace area is on or within 200 feet 
of the area of observed contamination.
    <bullet> Resources located on an area of observed contamination, as 
specified in section 5.1.
    <bullet> Terrestrial sensitive environments located on an area of 
observed contamination, as specified in section 5.1.
    5.1.3.1 Resident individual. Evaluate this factor based on whether 
there is a resident individual, as specified in section 5.1.3, who is 
subject to Level I or Level II concentrations.

[[Page 183]]

    First, determine those areas of observed contamination subject to 
Level I concentrations and those subject to Level II concentrations as 
specified in sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. Use the health-based benchmarks 
from Table 5-3 in determining the level of contamination. Then assign a 
value to the resident individual factor as follows:
    <bullet> Assign a value of 50 if there is at least one resident 
individual for one or more areas subject to Level I concentrations.
    <bullet> Assign a value of 45 if there is no such resident 
individuals, but there is at least one resident individual for one or 
more areas subject to Level II concentrations.
    <bullet> Assign a value of 0 if there is no resident individual.

    Enter the value assigned in Table 5-1.
    5.1.3.2  Resident population. Evaluate resident population based on 
two factors: Level I concentrations and Level II concentrations. 
Determine which factor applies as specified in sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2, 
using the health-based benchmarks from Table 5-3. Evaluate populations 
subject to Level I concentrations as specified in section 5.1.3.2.1 and 
populations subject to Level II concentrations as specified in section 
5.1.3.2.2.

    <bullet> Screening concentration for noncancer toxicological 
responses corresponding to the Reference Dose (RfD) for oral exposures.
........................................................................
    Count only those persons meeting the criteria for resident 
individual as specified in section 5.1.3. In estimating the number of 
people living on property with an area of observed contamination, when 
the estimate in based on the number of residences, multiply each 
residence by the average number of persons per residence for the county 
in which the residence is located.
    5.1.3.2.1  Level I concentrations. Sum the number of resident 
individuals subject to Level I concentrations and multiply this sum by 
10. Assign the resulting product as the value for this factor. Enter 
this value in Table 5-1.
    5.1.3.2.2  Level II concentrations. Sum the number of resident 
individuals subject to Level II concentrations. Do not include those 
people already counted under the Level I concentrations factor. Assign 
this sum as the value for this factor. Enter this value in Table 5-1.
    5.1.3.2.3  Calculation of resident population factor value. Sum the 
factor values for Level I concentrations and Level II concentrations. 
Assign this sum as the resident population factor value. Enter this 
value in Table 5-1.
    5.1.3.3  Workers. Evaluate this factor based on the number of 
workers that meet the section 5.1.3 criteria. Assign a value for these 
workers using Table 5-4. Enter this value in Table 5-1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    5.1.3.4  Resources. Evaluate the resources factor as follows:
    <bullet> Assign a value of 5 to the resources factor if one or more 
of the following is present on an area of observed contamination at the 
site:

-Commercial agriculture.
-Commercial silviculture.
-Commercial livestock production or commercial livestock grazing.

    <bullet> Assign a value of 0 if none of the above are present.
    Enter the value assigned in Table 5-1.
    5.1.3.5  Terrestrial sensitive environments. Assign value(s) from 
Table 5-5 to each terrestrial sensitive environment that meets the 
eligibility criteria of section 5.1.3.
    Calculate a value (ES) for terrestrial sensitive environments as 
follows:

  .....................   n

where:

S<INF>i=Value(s) assigned from Table 5-5 to terrestrial sensitive 
          environment i.
n=Number of terrestrial sensitive environments meeting section 5.1.3 
          criteria.

    Because the pathway score based solely on terrestrial sensitive 
environments is limited to a maximum of 60, determine the value for the 
terrestrial sensitive environments factor as follows:

    5.2.2  Waste characteristics. Evaluate waste characteristics based 
on two factors: toxicity and hazardous waste quantity. Evaluate only 
those hazardous substances that meet the criteria for observed 
contamination (see section 5.0.1) at areas that can be assigned an 
attractiveness/accessibility factor value greater than 0.
    5.2.2.1  Toxicity. Assign a toxicity factor value as specified in 
section 2.4.1.1 to each hazardous substance meeting the criteria in 
section 5.2.2. Use the hazardous substance with the highest toxicity 
factor value to assign the value to the toxicity factor for the nearby 
population threat. Enter this value in Table 5-1.
    5.2.2.2  Hazardous waste quantity. Assign a value to the hazardous 
waste quantity factor as specified in section 5.1.2.2, except: consider 
only those areas of observed contamination that can be assigned an 
attractiveness/accessibility factor value greater than 0. Enter the 
value assigned in Table 5-1.
    5.2.2.3  Calculation of waste characteristics factor category value. 
Multiply the toxicity and hazardous waste quantity factor values, 
subject to a maximum product of 1 x 10 \8\. Based on this product, 
assign a value from Table 2-7 (section 2.4.3.1) to the waste 
characteristics factor category. Enter this value in Table 5-1.
    5.2.3  Targets. Evaluate the targets factory category for the nearby 
population threat based on two factors: nearby individual and population 
within a 1-mile travel distance from the site.
    5.2.3.1  Nearby individual. If one or more persons meet the section 
5.1.3 criteria for a resident individual, assign this factor a value of 
0. Enter this value in Table 5-1.
    If no person meets the criteria for a resident individual, determine 
the shortest travel distance from the site to any residence or school. 
In determining the travel distance, measure the shortest overland 
distance an individual would travel from a residence or school to the 
nearest area of observed contamination for the site with an 
attractiveness/accessibility factor value greater than 0. If there are 
no natural barriers to travel, measure the travel distance as the 
shortest straight-line distance from the residence or school to the area 
of observed contamination. If natural barriers exist (for example, a 
river), measure the travel distance as the shortest straight-line 
distance from the residence or school to the nearest crossing point and 
from there as the shortest straight-line distance to the area of 
observed contamination. Based on the shortest travel distance, assign a 
value from Table 5-9 to the nearest individual factor. Enter this value 
in Table 5-1.

<SUP>a Assign a value of 0 if one or more persons meet the section 5.1.3     
  criteria for resident individual.                                     

    5.2.3.2  Population within 1 mile. Determine the population within 
each travel distance category of Table 5-10. Count residents and 
students who attend school within this travel distance. Do not include 
those people already counted in the resident population threat. 
Determine travel distances as specified in section 5.2.3.1.
    In estimating residential population, when the estimate is based on 
the number of residences, multiply each residence by the average number 
of persons per residence for the county in which the residence is 
located.
    Based on the number of people included within a travel distance 
category, assign a distance-weighted population value for that travel 
distance from Table 5-10.
    Calculate the value for the population within 1 mile factor (PN) as 
follows:


  .....................  1    3                                         
PN =...................  --   <greek-S>  W<INF>i                             
  .....................  10  i=1                                        
                                                                        

where:

W<INF>i=Distance-weighted population value from Table 5-10 for travel 
          distance category i.
    If PN is less than 1, do not round it to the nearest integer; if PN 
is 1 or more, round to the nearest integer. Enter this value in Table 5-
1.
    5.2.3.3  Calculation of nearby population targets factor category 
value. Sum the values for the nearby individual factor and the 
population within 1 mile factor. Do not round this sum to the nearest 
integer. Assign this sum as the targets factor category value for the 
nearby population threat. Enter this value in Table 5-1.

Enter this score in Table 5-1.
    5.3  Calculation of soil exposure pathway score. Sum the resident 
population threat score and the nearby population threat score, and 
divide the sum by 82,500. Assign the resulting value, subject to a

score in Table 5-1.

                       6.0  Air Migration Pathway

    Evaluate the air migration pathway based on three factor categories: 
likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets. Figure 6-1 
indicates the factors included within each factor category.
    Determine the air migration pathway score (S<INF>a) in terms of the 
factor category values as follows:

    6.1 Likelihood of Release. Evaluate the likelihood of release factor 
category in terms of an observed release factor or a potential to 
release factor.
    6.1.1  Observed release. Establish an observed release to the 
atmosphere by demonstrating that the site has released a hazardous 
substance to the atmosphere. Base this demonstration on either:
    <bullet> Direct observation--a material (for example, particulate 
matter) that contains one or more hazardous substances has been seen 
entering the atmosphere directly. When evidence supports the inference 
of a release of a material that contains one or more hazardous 
substances by the site to the atmosphere, demonstrated adverse effects 
accumulated with that release may be used to establish an observed 
release.
    <bullet> Chemical analysis--an analysis of air samples indicates 
that the concentration of ambient hazardous substance(s) has increased 
significantly above the background concentration for the site (see 
section 2.3). Some portion of the significant increase must be 
attributable to the site to establish the observed release.
    If an observed release can be established, assign an observed 
release factor value of 550, enter this value in Table 6-1, and proceed 
to section 6.1.3. If an observed release cannot be established, assign 
an observed release factor value of 0, enter this value in Table 6-1, 
and proceed to section 6.1.2.
    6.1.2  Potential to release. Evaluate potential to release only if 
an observed release cannot be established. Determine the potential to 
release factor value for the site by separately evaluating the gas 
potential to release and the particulate potential to release for each 
source at the site. Select the highest potential to release value 
(either gas or particulate) calculated for the sources evaluated and 
assign that value as the site potential to release factor value as 
specified below.
    6.1.2.1  Gas potential to release. Evaluate gas potential to release 
for those sources that contain gaseous hazardous substances--that is, 
those hazardous substances with a vapor pressure greater than or equal 
to 10<SUP>-9 torr.
    Evaluate gas potential to release for each source based on three 
factors: gas containment, gas source type, and gas migration potential. 
Calculate the gas potential to release value as illustrated in Table 6-
2. Combine sources with similar characteristics into a single source in 
evaluating the gas potential to release factors.

    6.1.2.1.3  Gas migration potential. Evaluate this factor for each 
source as follows:
    <bullet> Assign a value for gas migration potential to each of the 
gaseous hazardous substances associated with the source (see section 
2.2.2) as follows:

-Assign values from Table 6-5 for vapor pressure and Henry's constant to 
each hazardous substance. If Henry's constant cannot be determined for a 
hazardous substance, assign that hazardous substance a value of 2 for 
the Henry's constant component.
-Sum the two values assigned to the hazardous substance.
-Based on this sum, assign the hazardous substance a value from Table 6-
6 for gas migration potential.

    <bullet> Assign a value for gas migration potential to each source 
as follows:

-Select three hazardous substances associated with the source:
      -If more than three gaseous hazardous substances can be associated 
with the source, select three that have the highest gas migration 
potential values.
      -If fewer than three gaseous hazardous substances can be 
associated with a source, select all of them.
-Average the gas migration potential values assigned to the selected 
hazardous substances.
-Based on this average value, assign the source a gas migration 
potential value from Table 6-7.

    6.1.2.1.4  Calculation of gas potential to release value. Determine 
the gas potential to release value for each source as illustrated in 
Table 6-2. For each source, sum the gas source type factor value and gas 
migration potential factor value and multiply this sum by the gas 
containment factor value. Select the highest product calculated for the 
sources evaluated and assign it as the gas potential to release value 
for the site. Enter this value in Table 6-1.

potential to release for

[[Page 191]]

those sources that contain particulate hazardous substances--that is, 
those hazardous substances with a vapor pressure less than or equal to 
10<SUP>-1 torr.
    Evaluate particulate potential to release for each source based on 
three factors: particulate containment, particulate source type, and 
particulate migration potential. Calculate the particulate potential to 
release value as illustrated in Table 6-8. Combine sources with similar 
characteristics into a single source in evaluating the particulate 
potential to release factors.
    6.1.2.2.1  Particulate containment. Assign each source a value from 
Table 6-9 for particulate containment. Use the lowest value from Table 
6-9 that applies to the source.
    6.1.2.2.2  Particulate source type. Assign a value for particulate 
source type to each source in the same manner as specified for gas 
sources in section 6.1.2.1.2.
    6.1.2.2.3  Particulate migration potential. Based on the site 
location, assign a value from Figure 6-2 for particulate migration 
potential. Assign this same value to each source at the site.

    For site locations not on Figure 6-2, and for site locations near 
the boundary points on Figure 6-2, assign a value as follows. First, 
calculate a Thornthwaite P-E index using the following equation:


                                            12                          
                                      PE=   <greek-S>  115 [P<INF>i/(T<INF>i-     
                                            10)]<SUP>10/9                    
                                           i=1                          
                                                                        


where:

PE=Thornthwaite P-E index.
P<INF>i=Mean monthly precipitation for month i, in inches.
T<INF>i=Mean monthly temperature for month i, in degrees Fahrenheit; for 
          any month having a mean monthly temperature less than 28.4 
          deg.F, use 28.4  deg.F.
Based on the calculated Thornthwaite P-E index, assign a source 
particulate migration potential value to the site from Table 6-10. 
Assign this same value to each source at the site.

            Table 6-10--Particulate Migration Potential Values          
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                Assigned
                    Thornthwaite P-E Index                       value

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.1.2.2.4  Calculation of particulate potential to release value. 
Determine the particulate potential to release value for each source as 
illustrated in Table 6-8. For each source, sum its particulate source 
type factor value and particulate migration potential factor value and 
multiply this sum by its particulate containment factor value. Select 
the highest product calculated for the sources evaluated and assign it 
as the particulate potential to release value for the site. Enter the 
value in Table 6-1.
    6.1.2.3  Calculation of potential to release factor value for the 
site. Select the higher of the gas potential to release value assigned 
in section 6.1.2.1.4 and the particulate potential to release value 
assigned in section 6.1.2.2.4. Assign the value selected as the site 
potential to release factor value. Enter this value in Table 6-1.
    6.1.3  Calculation of likelihood of release factor category value. 
If an observed release is established, assign the observed release 
factor value of 550 as the likelihood of release factor category value. 
Otherwise, assign the site potential to release factor value as the 
likelihood of release factor category value. Enter the value in Table 6-
1.
    6.2  Waste characteristics. Evaluate the waste characteristics 
factor category based on two factors: toxicity/mobility and hazardous 
waste quantity. Evaluate only those hazardous substances available to 
migrate from the sources at the site to the atmosphere. Such hazardous 
substances include:
    <bullet> Hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed 
release to the atmosphere.
    <bullet> All gaseous hazardous substances associated with a source 
that has a gas containment factor value greater than 0 (see section 
2.2.2, 2.2.3, and 6.1.2.1.1).
    <bullet> All particulate hazardous substances associated with a 
source that has a particulate

[[Page 194]]

containment factor value greater than 0 (see section 2.2.2, 2.2.3, and 
6.1.2.2.1).
    6.2.1  Toxicity/mobility. For each hazardous substance, assign a 
toxicity factor value, a mobility factor value, and a combined toxicity/
mobility factor value as specified below. Select the toxicity/mobility 
factor value for the air migration pathway as specified in section 
6.2.1.3.
    6.2.1.1  Toxicity. Assign a toxicity factor value to each hazardous 
substance as specified in section 2.4.1.1.
    6.2.1.2  Mobility. Assign a mobility factor value to each hazardous 
substance as follows:
    <bullet> Gaseous hazardous substance.

-Assign a mobility factor value of 1 to each gaseous hazardous substance 
that meets the criteria for an observed release to the atmosphere.
-Assign a mobility factor value from Table 6-11, based on vapor 
pressure, to each gaseous hazardous substance that does not meet the 
criteria for an observed release.

    <bullet> Particulate hazardous substance.

-Assign a mobility factor value of 0.02 to each particulate hazardous 
substance that meets the criteria for an observed release to the 
atmosphere.
-Assign a mobility factor value from Figure 6-3, based on the site's 
location, to each particulate hazardous substance that does not meet the 
criteria for an observed release. (Assign all such particulate hazardous 
substances this same value.)
-For site locations not on Figure 6-3 and for site locations near the 
boundary points on Figure 6-3, assign a mobility factor value to each 
particulate hazardous substance that does not meet the criteria for an 
observed release as follows:
      -Calculate a value M:

    M=0.0182 (U\3\/[PE]\2\)
    where:

    U=Mean average annual wind speed (meters per second).
    PE=Thornthwaite P-E index from section 6.1.2.2.3.

      -Based on the value M, assign a mobility factor value from Table 
6-12 to each particulate hazardous substance.

    <bullet> Gaseous and particulate hazardous substances.

-For a hazardous substance potentially present in both gaseous and 
particulate forms, select the higher of the factor values for gas 
mobility and particulate mobility for that substance and assign that 
value as the mobility factor value for the hazardous substance.

    6.2.1.3  Calculation of toxicity/mobility factor value. Assign each 
hazardous substance a toxicity/mobility factor value from Table 6-13, 
based on the values assigned to the hazardous substance for the toxicity 
and mobility factors. Use the hazardous substance with the highest 
toxicity/mobility factor value to assign the value to the toxicity/
mobility factor for the air migration pathway. Enter this value in Table 
6-1.

    6.2.2  Hazardous waste quantity. Assign a hazardous waste quantity 
factor value for the air migration pathway as specified in section 
2.4.2. Enter this value in Table 6-1.
    6.2.3  Calculation of waste characteristics factor category value. 
Multiply the toxicity/mobility factor value and the hazardous waste 
quantity factor value, subject to a maximum product of 1  x  10<SUP>8. 
Based on this product, assign a value from Table 2-7 (section 2.4.3.1) 
to the waste characteristics factor category. Enter this value in Table 
6-1.
    6.3  Targets. 
    Evaluate the targets factor category based on four factors: nearest 
individual, population, resources, and sensitive environments. Include 
only those targets (for example, individuals, sensitive environments) 
located within the 4-mile target distance limit, except: if an observed 
release is established beyond the 4-mile target distance limit, include 
those additional targets that are specified below in this section and in 
section 6.3.4.
    Evaluate the nearest individual and population factors based on 
whether the target populations are subject to Level I concentrations, 
Level II concentrations, or potential contamination. Determine which 
applies to a target population as follows.
    If no samples meet the criteria for an observed release to air and 
if there is no observed release by direct observation, consider the 
entire population within the 4-mile target distance limit to be subject 
to potential contamination.
    If one or more samples meet the criteria for an observed release to 
air or if there is an observed release by direct observation, evaluate 
the population as follows:
    <bullet> Determine the most distant sample location that meets the 
criteria for Level I concentrations as specified in sections 2.5.1 and 
2.5.2 and the most distant location (that is, sample location or direct 
observation location) that meets the criteria for Level II 
concentrations. Use the health-based benchmarks from Table 6-14 in 
determining the level of contamination for sample locations. If the most 
distant Level II location is closer to a source than the most distant 
Level I sample location, do not consider the Level II location.
    <bullet> Determine the single most distant location (sample location 
or direct observation

[[Page 199]]

location) that meets the criteria for Level I or Level II 
concentrations.
    <bullet> If this single most distant location is within the 4-mile 
target distance limit, identify the distance categories from Table 6-15 
in which the selected Level I concentrations sample and Level II 
concentrations sample (or direct observation location) are located:

-Consider the target population anywhere within this furthest Level I 
distance category, or anywhere within a distance category closer to a 
source at the site, as subject to Level I concentrations.
-Consider the target population located beyond any Level I distance 
categories, up to and including the population anywhere within the 
furthest Level II distance category, as subject to Level II 
concentrations.
-Consider the remainder of the target population within the 4-mile 
target distance limit as subject to potential contamination.

    <bullet> If the single most distant location is beyond the 4-mile 
target distance limit, identify the distance at which the selected Level 
I concentrations sample and Level II concentrations sample (or direct 
observation location) are located:

-If the Level I sample location is within the 4-mile target distance 
limit, identify the target population subject to Level I concentrations 
as specified above.
-If the Level I sample location is beyond the 4-mile target distance 
limit, consider the target population located anywhere within a distance 
from the sources at the site equal to the distance to this sample 
location to be subject to Level I concentrations and include them in the 
evaluation.
-Consider the target population located beyond the Level I target 
population, but located anywhere within a distance from the sources at 
the site equal to the distance to the selected Level II location, to be 
subject to Level II concentrations and include them in the evaluation.
-Do not include any target population as subject to potential 
contamination.

    6.3.2  Population. In evaluating the population factor, count 
residents, students, and workers regularly present within the target 
distance limit. Do not count transient populations such as customers and 
travelers passing through the area.
    In estimating residential population, when the estimate is based on 
the number of residences, multiply each residence by the average number 
of persons per residence for the county in which the residence is 
located.
    6.3.2.1  Level of contamination. Evaluate the population factor 
based on three factors: Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, 
and potential contamination.

[[Page 200]]

    Evaluate the population subject to Level I concentrations (see 
section 6.3) as specified in section 6.3.2.2, the population subject to 
Level II concentrations as specified in section 6.3.2.3, and the 
population subject to potential contamination as specified in section 
6.3.2.4.
    For the potential contamination factor, use population ranges in 
evaluating the factor as specified in section 6.3.2.4. For the Level I 
and Level II concentrations factors, use the population estimate, not 
population ranges, in evaluating both factors.
    6.3.2.2  Level I concentrations. Sum the number of people subject to 
Level I concentrations. Multiply this sum by 10. Assign the product as 
the value for this factor. Enter this value in Table 6-1.
    6.3.2.3  Level II concentrations. Sum the number of people subject 
to Level II concentrations. Do not include those people already counted 
under the Level I concentrations factor. Assign this sum as the value 
for this factor. Enter this value in Table 6-1.
    6.3.2.4  Potential contamination. Determine the number of people 
within each distance category of the target distance limit (see Table 6-
15) who are subject to potential contamination. Do not include those 
people already counted under the Level I and Level II concentrations 
factors.
    Based on the number of people present within a distance category, 
assign a distance-weighted population value for that distance category 
from Table 6-17. (Note that the distance-weighted population values in 
Table 6-17 incorporate the distance weights from Table 6-15. Do not 
multiply the values from Table 6-17 by these distance weights.)
    Calculate the potential contamination factor value (PI) as follows:

  .....................  1    n                                         
PI=....................  --   <greek-S>  W<INF>i

where:
W<INF>i=Distance-weighted population from Table 6-17 for distance 
          category i.
n=Number of distance categories.

    If PI is less than 1, do not round it to the nearest integer; if PI 
is 1 or more, round to the nearest integer. Enter this value in Table 6-
1.
    6.3.2.5  Calculation of population factor value. Sum the factor 
values for Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, and 
potential contamination. Do not round this sum to the nearest integer. 
Assign this sum as the population factor value. Enter this value in 
Table 6-1.

    6.3.3  Resources. Evaluate the resources factor as follows:
    <bullet> Assign a value of 5 if one or more of the following 
resources are present within one-half mile of a source at the site 
having an air migration containment factor value greater than 0:
-Commercial agriculture.
-Commercial silviculture.
-Major or designated recreation area.
    <bullet> Assign a value of 0 if none of these resources is present.
    Enter the value assigned in Table 6-1.
    6.3.4  Sensitive environments. Evaluate sensitive environments based 
on two factors: actual contamination and potential contamination. 
Determine which factor applies as follows.
    If no samples meet the criteria for an observed release to air and 
if there is no observed release by direct observation, consider all 
sensitive environments located, partially or wholly, within the target 
distance limit to be subject to potential contamination.
    If one or more samples meet the criteria for an observed release to 
air or if there is an observed release by direct observation, determine 
the most distant location (that is, sample location or direct 
observation location) that meets the criteria for an observed release:
    <bullet> If the most distant location meeting the criteria for an 
observed release is within the 4-mile target distance limit, identify 
the distance category from Table 6-15 in which it is located:
-Consider sensitive environments located, partially or wholly, anywhere 
within this distance category or anywhere within a distance category 
closer to a source at the site as subject to actual contamination.
-Consider all other sensitive environments located, partially or wholly, 
within the target distance limit as subject to potential contamination.
    <bullet> If the most distant location meeting the criteria for an 
observed release is beyond the 4-mile target distance limit, identify 
the distance at which it is located:
-Consider sensitive environments located, partially or wholly, anywhere 
within a distance from the sources at the site equal to the distance to 
this location to be subject to actual contamination and include all such 
sensitive environments in the evaluation.
-Do not include any sensitive environments as subject to potential 
contamination.

    6.3.4.1 Actual contamination. Determine those sensitive environments 
subject to actual contamination (i.e., those located partially or wholly 
within a distance category subject to actual contamination). Assign 
value(s) from Table 4-23 (section 4.1.4.3.1.1) to each sensitive 
environment subject to actual contamination.
    For those sensitive environments that are wetlands, assign an 
additional value from Table 6-18. In assigning a value from Table 6-18, 
include only those portions of wetlands located within distance 
categories subject to actual contamination. If a wetland is located 
partially in a distance category subject to actual contamination and 
partially in one subject to potential contamination, then solely for 
purposes of Table 6-18, count the portion in the distance category 
subject to potential contamination under the potential contamination 
factor in section 6.3.4.2. Determine the total acreage of wetlands 
within those distance categories subject to actual contamination and 
assign a value from Table 6-18 based on this total acreage.
    Calculate the actual contamination factor value (EA) as follows:

  .....................   n                                             
EA = WA +..............   <greek-S>  S<INF>i

where:

WA=Value assigned from Table 6-18 for wetlands in distance categories 
          subject to actual contamination.
S<INF>i=Value(s) assigned from Table 4-23 to sensitive environment i.
n=Number of sensitive environments subject to actual contamination.

    For each distance category subject to potential contamination, sum 
the value(s) assigned from Table 4-23 to the sensitive environments in 
that distance category. If a sensitive environment is located in more 
than one distance category, assign the sensitive

[[Page 203]]

environment only to that distance category having the highest distance 
weighting value from Table 6-15.
    For those sensitive environments that are wetlands, assign an 
additional value from Table 6-18. In assigning a value from Table 6-18, 
include only those portions of wetlands located within distance 
categories subject to potential contamination, as specified in section 
6.3.4.1. Treat the wetlands in each separate distance category as 
separate sensitive environments solely for purposes of applying Table 6-
18. Determine the total acreage of wetlands within each of these 
distance categories and assign a separate value from Table 6-18 for each 
distance category.
    Calculate the potential contamination factor value (EP) as follows:

S<INF>ij=Value(s) assigned from Table 4-23 to sensitive environment in 
          distance category j.
n=Number of sensitive environments subject to potential contamination.
W<INF>j=Value assigned from Table 6-18 for wetland area in distance 
          category j.
D<INF>j=Distance weight from Table 6-15 for distance category j.
m=Number of distance categories subject to potential contamination.
    If EP is less than 1, do not round it to the nearest integer; if EP 
is 1 or more, round to the nearest integer. Enter the value assigned in 
Table 6-1.
    6.3.4.3  Calculation of sensitive environments factor value. Sum the 
factor values for actual contamination and potential contamination. Do 
not round this sum, designated as EB, to the nearest integer.
    Because the pathway score based solely on sensitive environments is 
limited to a maximum of 60, use the value EB to determine the value for 
the sensitive environments factor as follows:
    <bullet> Multiply the values assigned to likelihood of release (LR), 
waste characteristics (WC), and EB. Divide the product by 82,500.

-If the result is 60 or less, assign the value EB as the sensitive 
environments factor value.
-If the result exceeds 60, calculate a value EC as follows:

                                                                        
                                        (60)(82,500)                    
                                EC  = ----------------                  
                                          (LR)(WC)                      
                                                                        

    Assign the value EC as the sensitive environments factor value. Do 
not round this value to the nearest integer.
    Enter the value assigned for the sensitive environments factor in 
Table 6-1.
    6.3.5  Calculation of targets factor category value. Sum the nearest 
individual, population, resources, and sensitive environments factor 
values. Do not round this sum to the nearest integer. Assign this sum as 
the targets factor category value. Enter this value in Table 6-1.
    6.4  Calculation of air migration pathway score. Multiply the values 
for likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets, and round 
the product to the nearest integer. Then divide by 82,500. Assign the 
resulting value, subject to a maximum value of 100, as the air migration 
pathway score (S<INF>a). Enter this score in Table 6-1.

              7.0  Sites Containing Radioactive Substances.

    In general, radioactive substances are hazardous substances under 
CERCLA and should be considered in HRS scoring. Releases of certain 
radioactive substances are, however, excluded from the definition of 
``release'' in section 101(22) of CERCLA, as amended, and should not be 
considered in HRS scoring.
    Evaluate sites containing radioactive substances using the 
instructions specified in sections 2 through 6, supplemented by the 
instructions in this section. Those factors denoted with a ``yes'' in 
Table 7-1 are evaluated differently for sites containing radioactive 
substances than for sites containing only nonradioactive hazardous 
substances, while those denoted with a ``no'' are not evaluated 
differently and are not addressed in this section.

    In general, sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous 
substances involve more evaluation than sites containing only 
radionuclides. For sites containing mixed radioactive and other 
hazardous substances, HRS factors are evaluated based on considerations 
of both the radioactive substances and the other hazardous substances in 
order to derive a single set of factor values for each factor category 
in each of the four pathways. Thus, the HRS score for these sites 
reflects the combined potential hazards posed by both the radioactive 
and other hazardous substances.
    Section 7 is organized by factor category, similar to sections 3 
through 6. Pathway-specific differences in evaluation criteria are 
specified under each factor category, as appropriate. These differences 
apply largely to the soil exposure pathway and to sites containing mixed 
radioactive and other hazardous substances. All evaluation criteria 
specified in sections 2 through 6 must be met, except where modified in 
section 7.
    7.1  Likelihood of release/likelihood of exposure. Evaluate 
likelihood of release for the three migration pathways and likelihood of 
exposure for the soil exposure pathway as specified in sections 2 
through 6, except: establish an observed release and observed 
contamination as specified in section 7.1.1. When an observed release 
cannot be established for a migration pathway, evaluate potential to 
release as specified in section 7.1.2. When observed contamination 
cannot be established, do not evaluate the soil exposure pathway.
    7.1.1  Observed release/observed contamination. For radioactive 
substances, establish an observed release for each migration pathway by 
demonstrating that the site has released a radioactive substance to the 
pathway (or watershed or aquifer, as appropriate); establish observed 
contamination for the soil exposure pathway as indicated below. Base 
these demonstrations on one or more of the following, as appropriate to 
the pathway being evaluated:
    <bullet> Direct observation:

-For each migration pathway, a material that contains one or more 
radionuclides has been seen entering the atmosphere, surface water, or 
ground water, as appropriate, or is known to have entered ground water 
or surface water through direct deposition, or
-For the surface water migration pathway, a source area containing 
radioactive substances has been flooded at a time that radioactive 
substances were present and one or more radioactive substances were in 
contact with the flood waters.

    <bullet> Analysis of radionuclide concentrations in samples 
appropriate to the pathway (that is, ground water, soil, air, surface 
water, benthic, or sediment samples):

-For radionuclides that occur naturally and for radionuclides that are 
ubiquitous in the environment:
      -Measured concentration (in units of activity, for example, pCi 
per kilogram [pCi/kg], pCi per liter [pCi/1], pCi per cubic meter [pCi/
m<SUP>3]) of a given radionuclide in the sample are at a level that:
      -Equals or exceeds a value 2 standard deviations above the mean 
site-specific background concentration for that radionuclide in that 
type of sample, or
      -Exceeds the upper-limit value of the range of regional background 
concentration values for that specific radionuclide in that type of 
sample.
      -Some portion of the increase must be attributable to the site to 
establish the observed release (or observed contamination), and
      -For the soil exposure pathway only, the radionuclide must also be 
present at the surface or covered by 2 feet or less of cover material 
(for example, soil) to establish observed contamination.
-For man-made radionuclides without ubiquitous background concentrations 
in the environment:
      -Measured concentration (in units of activity) of a given 
radionuclide in a sample equals or exceeds the sample quantitation limit 
for that specific radionuclide in that type of media and is attributable 
to the site.
      -However, if the radionuclide concentration equals or exceeds its 
sample quantitation limit, but its release can also be attributed to one 
or more neighboring sites, then the measured concentration of that 
radionuclide must also equal or exceed a value either 2 standard 
deviations above the mean concentration of that radionuclide contributed 
by those neighboring sites or 3 times its background concentration, 
whichever is lower.
      -If the sample quantitation limit cannot be established:
      -If the sample analysis was performed under the EPA Contract 
Laboratory Program, use the EPA contract-required quantitation limit 
(CRQL) in place of the sample quantitation limit in establishing an 
observed release (or observed contamination).
      -If the sample analysis is not performed under the EPA Contract 
Labatory Program, use the detection limit in place of the sample 
quantitation limit.
      -For the soil exposure pathway only, the radionuclide must also be 
present at the surface or covered by 2 feet or less of cover material 
(for example, soil) to establish observed contamination.

    <bullet> Gamma radiation measurements (applies only to observed 
contamination for the soil exposure pathway):


[[Page 206]]


-The gamma radiation exposure rate, as measured in microroentgens per 
hour (<greek-m>R/hr) using a survey instrument held 1 meter above the 
ground surface (or 1 meter away from an aboveground source), equals or 
exceeds 2 times the site-specific background gamma radiation exposure 
rate.
-Some portion of the increase must be attributable to the site to 
establish observed contamination. The gamma-emitting radionuclides do 
not have to be within 2 feet of the surface of the source.

    For the three migration pathways, if an observed release can be 
established for the pathway (or aquifer or watershed, as appropriate), 
assign the pathway (or aquifer or watershed) an observed release factor 
value of 550 and proceed to section 7.2. If an observed release cannot 
be established, assign an observed release factor value of 0 and proceed 
to section 7.1.2.
    For the soil exposure pathway, if observed contamination can be 
established, assign the likelihood of exposure factor for resident 
population a value of 550 if there is an area of observed contamination 
in one or more locations listed in section 5.1; evaluate the likelihood 
of exposure factor for nearby population as specified in section 5.2.1; 
and proceed to section 7.2. If observed contamination cannot be 
established, do not evaluate the soil exposure pathway.
    At sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous 
substances, evaluate observed release (or observed contamination) 
separately for radionuclides as described in this section and for other 
hazardous substances as described in sections 2 through 6.
    For the three migration pathways, if an observed release can be 
established based on either radionuclides or other hazardous substances, 
or both, assign the pathway (or aquifer or watershed) an observed 
release factor value of 550 and proceed to section 7.2. If an observed 
release cannot be established based on either radionuclides or other 
hazardous substances, assign an observed release factor value of 0 and 
proceed to section 7.1.2.
    For the soil exposure pathway, if observed contamination can be 
established based on either radionuclides or other hazardous substances, 
or both, assign the likelihood of exposure factor for resident 
population a value of 550 if there is an area of observed contamination 
in one or more locations listed in section 5.1; evaluate the likelihood 
of exposure factor for nearby population as specified in section 5.2.1; 
and proceed to section 7.2. If observed contamination cannot be 
established based on either radionuclides or other hazardous substances, 
do not evaluate the soil exposure pathway.
    7.1.2  Potential to release. For the three migration pathways, 
evaluate potential to release for sites containing radionuclides in the 
same manner as specified for sites containing other hazardous 
substances. Base the evaluation on the physical and chemical properties 
of the radionuclides, not on their level of radioactivity.
    For sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous 
substances, evaluate potential to release considering radionuclides and 
other hazardous substances together. Evaluate potential to release for 
each migration pathway as specified in sections 3, 4, or 6, as 
appropriate.
    7.2  Waste characteristics. For radioactive substances, evaluate the 
human toxicity factor, the ecosystem toxicity factor, the surface water 
persistence factor, and the hazardous waste quantity factor as specified 
in the following sections. Evaluate all other waste characteristic 
factors as specified in sections 2 through 6.
    7.2.1  Human toxicity. For radioactive substances, evaluate the 
human toxicity factor as specified below, not as specified in section 
2.4.1.1.
    Assign human toxicity factor values to those radionuclides available 
to the pathway based on quantitative dose-response parameters for cancer 
risks as follows:
    <bullet> Evaluate radionuclides only on the basis of carcinogenicity 
and assign all radionuclides to weight-of-evidence category A.
    <bullet> Assign a human toxicity factor value from Table 7-2 to each 
radionuclide based on its slope factor (also referred to as cancer 
potency factor).

-For each radionuclide, use the higher of the slope factors for 
inhalation and ingestion to assign the factor value.
-If only one slope factor is available for the radionuclide, use it to 
assign the toxicity factor value.
-If no slope factor is available for the radionuclide, assign that 
radionuclide a toxicity factor value of 0 and use other radionuclides 
for which a slope factor is available to evaluate the pathway.

    <bullet> If all radionuclides available to a particular pathway are 
assigned a human toxicity factor value of 0 (that is, no slope factor is 
available for all the radionuclides), use a default human toxicity 
factor value of 1,000 as the human toxicity factor value for all 
radionuclides available to the pathway.
    At sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous 
substances, evaluate the toxicity factor separately for the radioactive 
and other hazardous substances and assign each a separate toxicity 
factor value. This applies regardless of whether the radioactive and 
other hazardous substances are physically separated, combined 
chemically, or simply mixed together. Assign toxicity factor values to 
the radionuclides as specified above and to the other hazardous 
substances as specified in section 2.4.1.1.

[[Page 207]]

    At sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous 
substances, if all radionuclides available to a particular pathway are 
assigned a human toxicity factor value of 0, use a default human 
toxicity factor value of 1,000 for all those radionuclides even if 
nonradioactive hazardous substances available to the pathway are 
assigned human toxicity factor values greater than 0. Similarly, if all 
nonradioactive hazardous substances available to the pathway are 
assigned a human toxicity factor value of 0, use a default human 
toxicity factor value of 100 for all these nonradioactive hazardous 
substances even if radionuclides available to the pathway are assigned 
human toxicity factor values greater than 0.
    7.2.2  Ecosystem toxicity. For the surface water environmental 
threat (see sections 4.1.4 and 4.2.4). assign an ecosystem toxicity 
factor value to radionuclides (alone or combined chemically or mixed 
with other hazardous substances) using the same slope factors and 
procedures specified for the human toxicity factor in section 7.2.1, 
except: use a default of 100, not 1,000, if all radionuclides eligible 
to be evaluated for ecosystem toxicity receive an ecosystem toxicity 
factor value of 0.

           Table 7-2--Toxicity Factor Values for Radionuclides

                                                                Assigned
              Cancer slope factor <SUP>a (SF) (pCi)<SUP>-1                 value

          SF<3 x 10<SUP>-12.......................................        100

------------------------------------------------------------------------
<SUP>a Radionuclide slope factors are estimates of age-averaged, individual  
  lifetime total excess cancer risk per picocurie of radionuclide       
  inhaled or ingested.                                                  

    At sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous 
substances, evaluate the ecosystem toxicity factor separately for the 
radioactive and other hazardous substances and assign each a separate 
ecosystem toxicity factor value. This applies regardless of whether the 
radioactive and other hazardous substances are physically separated, 
combined chemically, or simply mixed together. Assign ecosystem toxicity 
factor values to the radionuclides as specified above and to the other 
hazardous substances as specified in sections 4.1.4.2.1.1 and 
4.2.4.2.1.1. If all radionuclides available to a particular pathway are 
assigned an ecosystem toxicity factor value of 0, use a default 
ecosystem toxicity factor value of 100 for all these radionuclides even 
if nonradioactive hazardous substances available to the pathway are 
assigned ecosystem toxicity factor values greater than 0. Similarly, if 
all nonradioactive hazardous substances available to the pathway are 
assigned an ecosystem toxicity factor value of 0, use a default 
ecosystem toxicity factor value of 100 for all these nonradioactive 
hazardous substances even if radionuclides available to the pathway are 
assigned ecosystem toxicity factor values greater than 0.
    7.2.3   Persistence. For radionuclides, evaluate the surface water 
persistence factor based solely on half-life; do not include sorption to 
sediments in the evaluation as is done for nonradioactive hazardous 
substances. Assign a persistence factor value from Table 4-10 (section 
4.1.2.2.1.2) to each radionuclide based on half-life (t<INF>1/2) 
calculated as follows:

                                               1                        
                                   t<INF>1/2=   ----------                   
                                            1/r + 1/v                   
                                                                        

where:

r=Radioactive half-life.
v=Volatilization half-life.

    If the volatilization half-life cannot be estimated for a 
radionuclide from available data, delete it from the equation. Select 
the portion of Table 4-10 to use in assigning the persistence factor 
value as specified in section 4.1.2.2.1.2.
    At sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous 
substances, evaluate the persistence factor separately for each 
radionuclide and for each nonradioactive hazardous substance, even if 
the available data indicate that they are combined chemically. Assign a 
persistence factor value to each radionuclide as specified in this 
section and to each nonradioactive hazardous substance as specified in 
section 4.1.2.2.1.2. When combined chemically, assign a single 
persistence factor value based on the higher of the two values assigned 
(individually) to the radioactive and nonradioactive components.
    7.2.4  Selection of substance potentially posing greatest hazard. 
For each migration pathway (threat, aquifer, or watershed, as 
appropriate), select the radioactive substance or nonradioactive 
hazardous substance that potentially poses the greatest hazard based on 
its toxicity factor value, combined with the applicable mobility, 
persistence, and/or bioaccumulation (or ecosystem bioaccumulation) 
potential factor values. Combine these factor values as specified in 
sections 2, 3, 4, and 6. For the soil exposure pathway, base the 
selection on the toxicity factor alone (see sections 2 and 5).
    7.2.5  Hazardous waste quantity. To calculate the hazardous waste 
quantity factor value for sites containing radioactive substances, 
evaluate source hazardous waste quantity (see section 2.4.2.1) using 
only the following two measures in the following hierarchy (these 
measures are consistent with Tiers A and B for nonradioactive hazardous 
substances in sections 2.4.2.1.1 and 2.4.2.1.2):
    <bullet> Radionuclide constituent quantity (Tier A).

[[Page 208]]

    <bullet> Radionuclide wastestream quantity (Tier B).
    7.2.5.1  Source hazardous waste quantity for radionuclides. For each 
migration pathway, assign a source hazardous waste quantity value to 
each source having a containment factor value greater than 0 for the 
pathway being evaluated. For the soil exposure pathway, assign a source 
hazardous waste quantity value to each area of observed contamination, 
as applicable to the threat being evaluated. Allocate hazardous 
substances and hazardous wastestreams to specific sources (or areas of 
observed contamination) as specified in section 2.4.2.
    7.2.5.1.1  Radionuclide constituent quantity (Tier A). Evaluate 
radionuclide constituent quantity for each source (or area of observed 
contamination) based on the activity content of the radionuclides 
allocated to the source (or area of observed contamination) as follows:
    <bullet> Estimate the net activity content (in curies) for the 
source (or area of observed contamination) based on:
-Manifests, or
-Either of the following equations, as applicable:

  .....................   n                                             
N = 9.1  x  10<SUP>-7 (V)...   <greek-S>  AC<INF>i                                
  .....................  i=1                                            
                                                                        

      where:

      N=Estimated net activity content (in curies) for the source (or 
area of observed contamination).
      V=Total volume of material (in cubic yards) in a source (or area 
of observed contamination) containing radionuclides.
      AC<INF>i=Activity concentration above the respective background 
concentration (in pCi/g) for each radionuclide i allocated to the source 
(or area of observed contamination).
      n=Number of radionuclides allocated to the source (or area of 
observed contamination) above the respective background concentrations.
or,

  .....................   n                                             
N = 3.8  x  10<SUP>-12 (V)..   <greek-S>  AC<INF>i                                
  .....................  i=1                                            
                                                                        

      where:
      N=Estimated net activity content (in curies) for the source (or 
area of observed contamination).
      V=Total volume of material (in gallons) in a source (or area of 
observed contamination) containing radionuclides.
      AC<INF>i=Activity concentration above the respective background 
concentration (in pCi/1) for each radionuclide i allocated to the source 
(or area of observed contamination).
      n=Number of radionuclides allocated to the source (or area of 
observed contamination) above the respective background concentrations.
      -Estimate volume for the source (or volume for the area of 
observed contamination) based on records or measurements.
      -For the soil exposure pathway, in estimating the volume for areas 
of observed contamination, do not include more than the first 2 feet of 
depth, except: for those types of areas of observed contamination listed 
in Tier C of Table 5-2 (section 5.1.2.2).
      Include the entire depth, not just that within 2 feet of the 
surface.
    <bullet>  Convert from curies of radionuclides to equivalent pounds 
of nonradioactive hazardous substances by multiplying the activity 
estimate for the source (or area of observed contamination) by 1,000.
    <bullet>  Assign this resulting product as the radionuclide 
constituent quantity value for the source (or area of observed 
contamination).

    If the radionuclide constituent quantity for the source (or area of 
observed contamination) is adequately determined (that is, the total 
activity of all radionuclides in the source and releases from the source 
[or in the area of observed contamination] is known or is estimated with 
reasonable confidence), do not evaluate the radionuclide wastestream 
quantity measure in section 7.2.5.1.2. Instead, assign radionuclide 
wastestream quantity a value of 0 and proceed to section 7.2.5.1.3. If 
the radionuclide constituent quantity is not adequately determined, 
assign the source (or area of observed contamination) a value for 
radionuclide constituent quantity based on the available data and 
proceed to section 7.2.5.1.2.
    7.2.5.1.2  Radionuclide wastestream quantity (Tier B). Evaluate 
radionuclide wastestream quantity for the source (or area of observed 
contamination) based on the activity content of radionuclide 
wastestreams allocated to the source (or area of observed contamination) 
as follows:
    <bullet>  Estimate the total volume (in cubic yards or in gallons) 
of wastestreams containing radionuclides allocated to the source (or 
area of observed contamination).
    <bullet>  Divide the volume in cubic yards by 0.55 (or the volume in 
gallons by 110) to convert to the activity content expressed in terms of 
equivalent pounds of nonradioactive hazardous substances.
    <bullet>  Assign the resulting value as the radionuclide wastestream 
quantity value for the source (or area of observed contamination).
    7.2.5.1.3  Calculation of source hazardous waste quantity value for 
radionuclides. Select the higher of the values assigned to the source 
(or area of observed contamination)

[[Page 209]]

for radionuclide constituent quantity and radionuclide wastestream 
quantity. Assign this value as the source hazardous waste quantity value 
for the source (or area of observed contamination). Do not round to the 
nearest integer.
    7.2.5.2  Calculation of hazardous waste quantity factor value for 
radionuclides. Sum the source hazardous waste quantity values assigned 
to all sources (or areas of observed contamination) for the pathway 
being evaluated and round this sum to the nearest integer, except: if 
the sum is greater than 0, but less than 1, round it to 1. Based on this 
value, select a hazardous waste quantity factor value for this pathway 
from Table 2-6 (section 2.4.2.2).
    For a migration pathway, if the radionuclide constituent quantity is 
adequately determined (see section 7.2.5.1.1) for all sources (or all 
portions of sources and releases remaining after a removal action), 
assign the value from Table 2-6 as the hazardous waste quantity factor 
value for the pathway. If the radionuclide constituent quantity is not 
adequately determined for one or more sources (or one or more portions 
of sources or releases remaining after a removal action), assign a 
factor value as follows:
    <bullet>  If any target for that migration pathway is subject to 
Level I or Level II concentrations (see section 7.3), assign either the 
value from Table 2-6 or a value of 100, whichever is greater, as the 
hazardous waste quantity factor value for that pathway.
    <bullet>  If none of the targets for that pathway is subject to 
Level I or Level II concentrations, assign a factor value as follows:

-If there has been no removal action, assign either the value from Table 
2-6 or a value of 10, whichever is greater, as the hazardous waste 
quantity factor value for that pathway.
-If there has been a removal action:
      -Determine values from Table 2-6 with and without consideration of 
the removal action.
      -If the value that would be assigned from Table 2-6 without 
consideration of the removal action would be 100 or greater, assign 
either the value from Table 2-6 with consideration of the removal action 
or a value of 100, whichever is greater, as the hazardous waste quantity 
factor value for the pathway.
      -If the value that would be assigned from Table 2-6 without 
consideration of the removal action would be less than 100, assign a 
value of 10 as the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the 
pathway.

    For the soil exposure pathway, if the radionuclide constituent 
quantity is adequately determined for all areas of observed 
contamination, assign the value from Table 2-6 as the hazardous waste 
quantity factor value. If the radionuclide constituent quantity is not 
adequately determined for one or more areas of observed contamination, 
assign either the value from Table 2-6 or a value of 10, whichever is 
greater, as the hazardous waste quantity factor value.
    7.2.5.3  Calculation of hazardous waste quantity factor value for 
sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances. For 
each source (or area of observed contamination) containing mixed 
radioactive and other hazardous substances, calculate two source 
hazardous waste quantity values--one based on radionuclides as specified 
in sections 7.2.5.1 through 7.2.5.1.3 and the other based on the 
nonradioactive hazardous substances as specified in sections 2.4.2.1 
through 2.4.2.1.5 (that is, determine each value as if the other type of 
substance was not present). Sum the two values to determine a combined 
source hazardous waste quantity value for the source (or area of 
observed contamination). Do not round this value to the nearest integer.
    Use this combined source hazardous waste quantity value to calculate 
the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the pathway as specified 
in section 2.4.2.2, except: if either the hazardous constituent quantity 
or the radionuclide constituent quantity, or both, are not adequately 
determined for one or more sources (or one or more portions of sources 
or releases remaining after a removal action) or for one or more areas 
of observed contamination, as applicable, assign the value from Table 2-
6 or the default value applicable for the pathway, whichever is greater, 
as the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the pathway.
    7.3  Targets. For radioactive substances, evaluate the targets 
factor category as specified in section 2.5 and sections 3 through 6, 
except: establish Level I and Level II concentrations at sampling 
locations as specified in sections 7.3.1 and 7.3.2.
    For all pathways (and threats), use the same target distance limits 
for sites containing radioactive substances as is specified in sections 
3 through 6 for sites containing nonradioactive hazardous substances. At 
sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances, 
include all sources (or areas of observed contamination) at the site in 
identifying the applicable targets for the pathway.
    7.3.1  Level of contamination at a sampling location. Determine 
whether Level I or Level II concentrations apply at a sampling location 
(and thus to the associated targets) as follows:
    <bullet> Select the benchmarks from section 7.3.2 applicable to the 
pathway (or threat) being evaluated.
    <bullet> Compare the concentrations of radionuclides in the sample 
(or comparable samples) to their benchmark concentrations for

[[Page 210]]

the pathway (or threat) as specified in section 7.3.2. Treat comparable 
samples as specified in section 2.5.1.
    <bullet> Determine which level applies based on this comparison.
    <bullet> If none of the radionuclides eligible to be evaluated for 
the sampling location have an applicable benchmark, assign Level II to 
the actual contamination at that sampling location for the pathway (or 
threat).
    <bullet> In making the comparison, consider only those samples, and 
only those radionuclides in the sample, that meet the criteria for an 
observed release (or observed contamination) for the pathway, except: 
tissue samples from aquatic human food chain organisms may also be used 
for the human food chain threat of the surface water pathway as 
specified in sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3.
    7.3.2  Comparison to benchmarks. Use the following media specific 
benchmarks (expressed in activity units, for example, pCi/l for water, 
pCi/kg for soil and for aquatic human food chain organisms, and pCi/
m<SUP>3 for air) for making the comparisons for the indicated pathway 
(or threat):
    <bullet> Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs)--ground water migration 
pathway and drinking water threat in surface water migration pathway.
    <bullet> Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA) 
standards--soil exposure pathway only.
    <bullet> Screening concentration for cancer corresponding to that 
concentration that corresponds to the 10<SUP>-6 individual cancer risk 
for inhalation exposures (air migration pathway) or for oral exposures 
(ground water migration pathway; drinking water or human food chain 
threats in surface water migration pathway; and soil exposure pathway).

-For the soil exposure pathway, include two screening concentrations for 
cancer--one for ingestion of surface materials and one for external 
radiation exposures from gamma-emitting radionuclides in surface 
materials.

    Select the benchmark(s) applicable to the pathway (or threat) being 
evaluated. Compare the concentration of each radionuclide from the 
sampling location to its benchmark concentration(s) for that pathway (or 
threat). Use only those samples and only those radionuclides in the 
sample that meet the criteria for an observed release (or observed 
contamination) for the pathway, except: tissue samples from aquatic 
human food chain organisms may be used as specified in sections 4.1.3.3 
and 4.2.3.3. If the concentration of any applicable radionuclide from 
any sample equals or exceeds its benchmark concentration, consider the 
sampling location to be subject to Level I concentrations for that 
pathway (or threat). If more than one benchmark applies to the 
radionuclide, assign Level I if the radionuclide concentration equals or 
exceeds the lowest applicable benchmark concentration. In addition, for 
the soil exposure pathway, assign Level I concentrations at the sampling 
location if measured gamma radiation exposure rates equal or exceed 2 
times the background level (see section 7.1.1).
    If no radionuclide individually equals or exceeds its benchmark 
concentration, but more than one radionuclide either meets the criteria 
for an observed release (or observed contamination) for the sample or is 
eligible to be evaluated for a tissue sample (see sections 4.1.3.3 and 
4.2.3.3), calculate a value for index I for these radionuclides as 
specified in section 2.5.2. If I equals or exceeds 1, assign Level I to 
the sampling location. If I is less than 1, assign Level II.
    At sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous 
substances, establish the level of contamination for each sampling 
location considering radioactive substances and nonradioactive hazardous 
substances separately. Compare the concentration of each radionuclide 
and each nonradioactive hazardous substance from the sampling location 
to its respective benchmark concentration(s). Use only those samples and 
only those substances in the sample that meet the criteria for an 
observed release (or observed contamination) for the pathway except: 
tissue samples from aquatic human food chain organisms may be used as 
specified in sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3. If the concentration of one 
or more applicable radionuclides or other hazardous substances from any 
sample equals or exceeds its benchmark concentration, consider the 
sampling location to be subject to Level I concentrations. If more than 
one benchmark applies to a radionuclide or other hazardous substance, 
assign Level I if the concentration of the radionuclide or other 
hazardous substance equals or exceeds its lowest applicable benchmark 
concentration.
    If no radionuclide or other hazardous substance individually exceed 
a benchmark concentration, but more than one radionuclide or other 
hazardous substance either meets the criteria for an observed release 
(or observed contamination) for the sample or is eligible to be 
evaluated for a tissue sample, calculate an index I for both types of 
substances as specified in section 2.5.2. Sum the index I values for the 
two types of substances. If the value, individually or combined, equals 
or exceeds 1, assign Level I to the sample location. If it is less than 
1, calculate an index J for the nonradioactive hazardous substances as 
specified in section 2.5.2. If J equals or exceeds 1, assign Level I to 
the sampling location. If J is less than 1, assign Level II.

    1.1  Scope and Application. The methods described below apply to 
``dispersants, surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, 
bioremediation agents, and miscellaneous oil spill control agents'' 
involving subpart J (Use of Dispersants and Other Chemicals) in

[[Page 246]]

40 CFR Part 300 (National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution 
Contingency Plan). They are revisions and additions to the EPA's 
Standard Dispersant Effectiveness and Toxicity Tests (1). The new 
Swirling Flask Dispersant Effectiveness Test is used only for testing 
dispersants. The Revised Standard Dispersant Toxicity Test is used for 
testing dispersants, as well as surface washing agents, surface 
collecting agents, and miscellaneous oil spill control agents. The 
bioremediation agent effectiveness test is used for testing 
bioremediation agents only.
    1.2  Definitions. The definitions of dispersants, surface washing 
agents, surface collecting agents, bioremediation agents, and 
miscellaneous oil spill control agents are provided in 40 CFR 300.5.

            2.0  Swirling Flask Dispersant Effectiveness Test

    2.1  Summary of Method. This protocol was developed by Environment 
Canada to provide a relatively rapid and simple testing procedure for 
evaluating dispersant effectiveness (2). It uses a modified Erlenmeyer 
flask to which a side spout has been added for removing subsurface 
samples of water near the bottom of the flask without disturbing a 
surface oil layer. Seawater and a surface layer of oil are added to the 
flask. Turbulent mixing is provided by placing the flask on a standard 
shaker table at 150 rpm for 20 minutes to induce a swirling motion to 
the liquid contents. Following shaking, the flask is immediately removed 
from the shaker table and maintained in a stationary position for 10 
minutes to allow the oil that will reform a slick to return to the 
water's surface. A sample of water for chemical analysis is then removed 
from the bottom of the flask through the side spout, extracted with 
methylene chloride (dichloromethane-DCM), and analyzed for oil content 
by UV-visible absorption spectrophotometry at wavelengths of 340, 370, 
and 400 nm (2).
    2.2  Apparatus.
    2.2.1  Modified Erlenmeyer Flask. Use 125-ml glass Erlenmeyer flasks 
that have been modified to include an attachment of a glass side spout 
that extends from the bottom of the flask upward to the neck region, as 
shown in Figure 1.
    2.2.2  Shaker Table. Use a shaker table with speed control unit with 
variable speed (40-400 rpm) and an orbital diameter of approximately 
0.75 inches (2 cm) to provide turbulence to solutions in test flasks.
    2.2.3  Spectrophotometer. Use a UV-visible spectrophotometer capable 
of measuring absorbance at 340, 370, and 400 nm. A Hitachi Model U-2000 
or equivalent is acceptable for this purpose.
    2.2.4  Glassware. Glassware should consist of 5-, 10-, 25-, 100-, 
and 500-ml graduated cylinders; 125-ml separatory funnels with Teflon 
stopcocks; and 10-, 100-, and 1,000-ml volumetric flasks and 
micropipettes.

    2.3 Reagents. 2.3.1 Synthetic seawater. The synthetic sea salt 
``Instant Ocean,'' manufactured by Aquarium Systems of Mentor, OH, can 
be used for this purpose. The synthetic seawater solution is prepared by 
dissolving 34 g of the salt mixture in 1 liter of distilled water (i.e., 
a salinity of 34 ppt). Table 1 provides a list of the ion composition of 
the seasalt mixture.

    2.3.2  Test oil. Two EPA/American Petroleum Institute (API) standard 
reference oils, Prudhoe Bay and South Louisiana crude, should be used 
for this test. These oils can be obtained from the Resource Technology 
Corporation, 2931 Soldier Springs Road, P.O. Box 1346, Laramie, WY 
82070, (307) 742-5452. These oils have been thoroughly homogenized, as 
well as characterized physically and chemically for previous EPA and API 
studies. Various selected parameters are presented in Table 2.

    2.3.3  Methylene Chloride (Dichloromethane-DCM), pesticide quality. 
For extraction of all sample water and oil-standard water samples.
    2.4  Pretest preparation. 2.4.1 Preparation and analysis of oil 
standards. 2.4.1.1 Standard solutions of oil for calibrating the UV-
visible spectrophotometer are prepared with the specific reference oils 
and dispersant used for a particular set of experimental test runs. For 
experiments with no dispersant, only oil is used to make the standard 
solution. For experiments with the oil plus dispersant, the standard is 
made with a 1:10 (v:v) mixture of the dispersant to the test oil (i.e., 
a dispersant-to-oil ratio of 1:10). This ratio is used in the test tank 
with dispersant added. The presence of water and certain dispersants in 
DCM extracts can affect absorbance readings in a spectrophotometer. All 
standard solutions of oil (and dispersant, if present) should be 
prepared in a stepwise manner that reflects the analytical protocol used 
for the experimental water samples.
    2.4.1.2  To prepare the standards, prepare a parent oil-DCM standard 
by mixing 1 part oil (plus 1/10 part premixed dispersant, if applicable) 
to 9 parts DCM (i.e., 1:10 dilution of the oil v:v). Add a specific 
volume of the parent oil-DCM standard to 30 ml of synthetic seawater in 
a separatory funnel. Extract the oil-water mixture with 5-ml volumes of 
DCM after 15 seconds of vigorous shaking followed by a 2 minute 
stationary period to allow for phase separation for each extraction. 
Repeat the extraction using a total of three 5-ml portions of DCM. 
Adjust the final DCM volume for the combined extracts to 20 ml with DCM 
in a 25-ml graduated cylinder.
    2.4.1.3  The quantities of oil used to achieve the desired 
concentrations in the final 20-ml DCM extracts for the standard oil-
solutions are summarized in Table 3. Specific masses for oil amounts in 
standards are determined as volumes of oil multiplied by the density of 
the oil.
    2.4.2  Linear stability calibration of UV-Visible spectrophotometer.
    2.4.2.1  Before DCM-extracts of dispersed oil-water samples can be 
analyzed for their oil content, the UV-visible spectrophotometer must 
meet an instrument stability calibration criterion. This criterion is 
determined with the six oil standards identified in Table 3. Determine 
the absorbance of standards at each of the three analytical wavelengths 
(i.e., 340, 370, and 400 nm). Determine the response factors (RFs) for 
the test

[[Page 249]]

oil at each of the three analytical wavelengths using the following 
equation:

  RF<INF>x=C/A<INF>x          (1)

where:
RF<INF>x=Response factor at wavelength x (x=340, 370, or 400 nm)
C=Oil concentration, in mg of oil/ml of DCM in standard solution
A<INF>x=Spectrophotometric absorbance of wavelength x

\1\ Assuming an oil density of 0.9 g/ml and an extraction efficiency of 
  100% for oil from the 30-ml of seawater.                              

    2.4.2.2  Instrument stability for the initial calibration is 
acceptable when the RFs for the five highest standard extracts of oil 
are <20% different from the overall mean value for the five standards. 
If this criterion is satisfied, analysis of sample extracts can begin. 
RFs for the lowest concentration (0.05 mg oil/ml DCM) are not included 
in the consideration because the absorbance is close to the detection 
limit of the spectrophotometer (with associated high variability in the 
value) for the 1-cm path-length cell used for measurements. Absorbances 
<gr-thn-eq>3.5 are not included because absorbance saturation occurs at 
and above this value.
    2.4.2.3  If one or more of the standard oil extracts do not meet 
this linear-stability criterion, then the ``offending'' standard(s) can 
be prepared a second time (i.e., extraction of the specified amount of 
oil from 30-ml or seawater for the ``offending'' standard according to 
the pretest preparation procedure). If replacement of the reanalyzed 
standard solution(s) in the standard curve meets the linear-stability 
criterion (i.e., no RF >20% different from the overall mean), then 
analysis of sample extracts can begin.
    2.4.2.4  If the initial-stability criterion is still not satisfied, 
analysis of sample extract cannot begin and the source of the problem 
(e.g., preparation protocol for the oil standards, spectrophotometer 
stability, etc.) must be corrected.
    2.4.2.5  The initial six-point calibration of the UV-visible 
spectrophotometer at the oil concentrations identified is required at 
least once per test day.
    2.5  Test procedure. 2.5.1 Preparation of premixed dispersant oil. 
Prepare a premixed dispersant oil by mixing 1 part dispersant to 10 
parts oil. Store this mixture in a glass container. The dispersant 
effectiveness test procedures are listed in steps 1-20:
    1. Prepare 4 replicates (same test oil and dispersant), one control 
(i.e., no dispersant), and one method blank and run at the same time on 
the shaker table.
    2. Add 120<plus-minus>2 ml of synthetic seawater to each of the 
modified 125-ml glass Erlenmeyer flasks. Measure and record the water 
temperature.
    3. Place the flasks securely into the attached slot on the shaker 
table.
    4. Carefully add 100 <greek-m>l of an oil-dispersant solution onto 
the center of the water's surface using a positive displacement pipette.
    5. Agitate the flasks for 20<plus-minus>1 minutes at 
150<plus-minus>10 rpm on the shaker table.
    6. After the 20<plus-minus>1 minutes shaking, remove the flasks from 
the shaker table and allow them to remain stationary for 10<plus-minus>1 
minutes for oil droplet ``settling.''
    7. At the conclusion of the 10-minute settling period, carefully 
decant a 30-ml sample through the side spout of the test flasks into a 
50-ml graduated cylinder.

    Note: Discard the first 1-2 ml of sample water to remove 
nonhomogeneous water-oil initially contained in the spout.

    8. Transfer the samples from the graduated cylinder into a 125- or 
250-ml glass separatory funnel fitted with a Teflon stopcock.
    9. Add 5 ml of pesticide-quality DCM to the separatory funnel and 
shake vigorously for 15 seconds. Release the pressure carefully from the 
separatory funnel through the stopcock into a fume hood.
    10. Allow the funnel to remain in a stationary position for 2 
minutes to allow phase-separation of the water and DCM.
    11. Drain the DCM layer from the separatory funnel into a glass-
stoppered, 25-ml graduated glass cylinder.
    12. Repeat the DCM-extraction process two additional times.
    13. Combine the three extracts in the graduated cylinder and adjust 
the final volume to 20-ml with additional DCM.
    14. Analyze the samples using a UV-spectrophotometer at 340, 370, 
and 400 nm-wavelengths and determine the quantity of oil as follows:

      C<INF>x=(A<INF>x)x(RF<INF>x)x(V<INF>DCM)x(V<INF>tw/V<INF>ew)    
(2)

where:
C<INF>x=Total mass of dispersed oil in swirling flask at wavelength x 
          (x=340, 370, or 400 nm)
A<INF>x=Spectrophotometric absorbance at wavelength x
RF<INF>x=Mean response factor at wavelength x (determined from equation 
          1)
V<INF>DCM=Final volume of DCM-extract of water sample (20 ml)
V<INF>tw=Total water volume in swirling flask vessel (120 ml)

[[Page 250]]

V<INF>ew=Volume of water extracted for dispersed oil content (30 ml)
    15. Obtain three concentration values for oil in each experimental 
water sample (340, 370, and 400 nm).
    16. Determine the mean of three values as follows:
  C<INF>mean=(C<INF>340+C<INF>370+C<INF>400)/3      (3)

    Note: Means will be used for all dispersion-performance 
calculations. Samples where one of the values for C<INF>340, C<INF>370, 
or C<INF>400 is more than 30% different from C<INF>mean will be flagged. 
Whenever oil measurements are flagged as having a concentration based on 
one wavelength as >30% different from C<INF>mean, raw data will be 
evaluated to establish that the measurements are valid. In addition, 
attempts will be made to correlate the difference to oil type, 
dispersant test, or dispersant used. If no errors or correlations are 
apparent and >10% of all oil measurements are flagged, the mean 
concentration data will be used in the calculation for dispersant 
performance and the subject data will be flagged.

    17. Determine the dispersant performance (i.e., percent of oil that 
is dispersed, or EFF) based on the ratio of oil dispersed in the test 
system to the total oil added to the system as follows:

  EFF (in %)=(C<INF>mean/C<INF>TOT)x100    (4)
where:
C<INF>mean=Mean value for total mass of dispersed oil in the swirling 
          flask determined by spectrophotometric analysis
C<INF>TOT=Total mass of oil initially added to the experimental swirling 
          flask
    18. Calculate EFF using equation 4 for coupled experiments with and 
without dispersant (EFF<INF>c and EFF<INF>d, respectively). EFF<INF>c is 
the effectiveness of the control and represents natural dispersion of 
the oil in the test apparatus. EFF<INF>d is the measured uncorrected 
value.
    19. Calculate the final dispersant performance of a chemical 
dispersant agent after correcting for natural dispersion using equation 
5.

  EFF<INF>D=EFF<INF>d--EFF<INF>c          (5)
where:
EFF<INF>D=% dispersed oil due to dispersant only
EFF<INF>d=% dispersed oil with dispersant added
EFF<INF>c= % dispersed oil with no dispersant added
    20. Calculate the average dispersant effectiveness value by summing 
the corrected values (EFF<INF>D) for each of the four replicates for 
each of the two test oils and dividing this sum by eight.
    2.6 Performance criterion. The dispersant product tested will remain 
in consideration for addition to the NCP Product Schedule if the average 
dispersant effectiveness, as calculated in section 2.5 above, is at 
least 45% (i.e., 50%<plus-minus>5%).
    2.7  Quality Control (QC) procedures for measurements of oil 
concentrations. 2.7.1 UV-visible spectrophotometric measurements. At 
least 5% of all UV-visible spectrophotometric measurements will be 
performed in duplicate as a QC check on the analytical measurement 
method. The absorbance values for the duplicates should agree within 
<plus-minus>5% of their mean value.
    2.7.2  Method blanks. Analytical method blanks involve an analysis 
of seawater blanks (i.e., seawater but no oil or dispersant in a 
swirling flask vessel) through testing and analytical procedures (3, pp 
79-80). Method blanks are analyzed with a frequency of at least 1 for 
every 12 experimental swirling flask samples. Oil concentrations in 
method blanks must be <5% of that occurring for 100% dispersion of oil 
in testing apparatus.

             3.0  Revised standard dispersant toxicity test

    3.1  Summary of method. The standard toxicity test for dispersants 
and other products involves exposing two species (Menidia beryllina 
(silversides) and Mysidopsis bahia (mysid shrimp)) to five 
concentrations of the test product and No. 2 fuel oil alone and in a 
1:10 mixture of product to oil. To aid in comparing results from assays 
performed by different workers, reference toxicity tests are conducted 
using dodecyl sodium sulfate (DSS) as a reference toxicant. The test 
length is 96 hours for Menidia and 48 hours for Mysidopsis. LC<INF>50s 
are calculated based on mortality data at the end of the exposure period 
(for method of calculation, see section 3.6 below).
    3.2  Selection and preparation of test materials.
    3.2.1  Test organisms.
    3.2.1.1  Menidia beryllina. Obtain fish (silversides) from a single 
source for each series of toxicity tests. In-house cultures are 
recommended wherever it is cost-effective; however, organisms are 
available from commercial suppliers. Information on the source of test 
organisms and any known unusual condition to which fish were exposed 
before use should be included in the data report. Use of animals 
previously treated with pesticides or chemotherapeutic agents should be 
avoided. Organisms should not be used if they appear to be unhealthy, 
discolored, or show signs of stress. Use 7-day old larval fish. Fish 
should be cultured in accordance with the methods outlined in Middaugh, 
et al. (5). There should be no need to acclimate organisms to the 
25<plus-minus>1 deg.C temperature recommended for the toxicity tests if 
laboratory stock cultures of Menidia are maintained at the recommended 
culture temperature of 25<plus-minus>1 deg.C. If test organisms must be 
obtained from a commercial source, it may become necessary to acclimate 
test fish to the test temperature of 25<plus-minus>1 deg.C, a pH of 
8.0<plus-minus>0.2, and 20<plus-minus>2 ppt salinity since changes in 
temperature may occur during shipping. Eliminate groups of fish having a 
mortality of

[[Page 251]]

more than 10% during the first 48 hours, and more than 5% thereafter. 
During acclimation, organisms should be maintained on a diet of freshly 
hatched Artemia (brine shrimp) nauplii. Feed the fish daily to satiation 
during the acclimation period, and once daily during the 96-hour test. 
Care should be taken daily to remove excess food and fecal material from 
beakers during the test. Use only those organisms that feed actively and 
that appear to be healthy. Organisms should be free of disease, external 
parasites, and any signs of physical damage or stress. Discard any fish 
injured or dropped while handling.
    3.2.1.2  Mysidopsis bahia. Several methods for culturing Mysidopsis 
bahia (mysid shrimp) may be used and are noted in appendix A of Methods 
for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of Effluents and Receiving Waters to 
Freshwater and Marine Organisms (6). To ensure uniformity of mysids, 
recently hatched mysids should be collected daily from stock cultures 
and identified by the date of hatch. Mysids used in 48-hour tests should 
be from a single day's collection, but may have an age range of 5-7 days 
old. In cases where in-house cultures of mysids are unavailable, 
organisms may be purchased from a commercial source. Information on the 
source of test organisms should be submitted in the data report.
    3.2.2  Preparation of experimental water. Filtered natural seawater 
is recommended for use since it represents a natural source of saltwater 
containing an inherent population of microorganisms. Synthetic seawater 
formulated according to the following method can serve as an acceptable 
alternative to filtered, natural seawater for toxicity tests performed 
in laboratories in which natural seawater is unavailable.
    3.2.3  Synthetic seawater formation. To prepare standard seawater, 
mix technical-grade salts with 900 liters of distilled or demineralized 
water in the order and quantities listed in Table 4. These ingredients 
must be added in the order listed and each ingredient must be dissolved 
before another is added. Stir constantly after each addition during 
preparation until dissolution is complete. Add distilled or 
demineralized water to make up to 1,000 liters. The pH should now be 
8.0<plus-minus>0.2. To attain the desired salinity of 20<plus-minus>1 
ppt, dilute again with distilled or demineralized water at time of use.
    3.3  Sampling and storage of test materials. Toxicity tests are 
performed with No. 2 fuel oil having the characteristics defined in 
Table 5. Store oil used for toxicity tests in sealed containers to 
prevent the loss of volatiles and other changes. For ease in handling 
and use, it is recommended that 1,000-ml glass containers be used. To 
ensure comparable results in the bioassay tests, use oils packaged and 
sealed at the source. Dispose of unused oil in each open container on 
completion of dosing to prevent its use at a later date when it may have 
lost some of its volatile components. Run all tests in a bioassay series 
with oil from the same container and with organisms from the same group 
collected or secured from the same source.

    3.4  General test conditions and procedures for toxicity tests.
    3.4.1 Temperature. For these toxicity tests, use test solutions with 
temperatures of 25<plus-minus>1 deg.C.
    3.4.2 Dissolved oxygen and aeration.
    3.4.2.1 Menidia. Because oils contain toxic, volatile materials, and 
because the toxicity of some water-soluble fractions of oil and 
degradation products are changed by oxidation, special care must be used 
in the oxygenation of test solutions. Aeration during the test is 
generally not recommended but should be used to maintain the required 
dissolved oxygen (DO) in cases where low DO is observed. The DO content 
of test solutions must not drop below 60% saturation during the first 48 
hours of a static acute (96-hour) test and must remain between 40-100% 
after the first 48 hours of the test. Aeration at a rate of 
100<plus-minus>15 bubbles per minute is supplied by a serological 
pipette as needed for maintenance of DO. If aeration is necessary, all 
test chambers should be aerated. At this rate, and with the proper 
weight of fish, DO concentration should remain slightly above 4 ppm over 
a 96-hour period. Take DO measurements daily.

    3.4.2.2 Mysidopsis. Achieve sufficient DO by ensuring that the 
surface area to volume ratio of the test solution exposed is large 
enough. Oxygen content should remain high throughout the test because of 
the low oxygen demand of the organisms. Aeration is not recommended 
during 48-hour acute toxicity tests unless the DO falls below 60% 
saturation.
    3.4.3 Controls. With each fish or mysid test or each series of 
simultaneous tests of different solutions, perform a concurrent control 
test in exactly the same manner as the other tests and under the 
conditions prescribed or selected for those tests. Use the diluent water 
alone as the medium in which the controls are held. There must be no 
more than 10% mortality among the controls during the course of any 
valid test.
    3.4.4 Reference toxicant. To aid in comparing results from tests 
performed by different workers and to detect changes in the condition of 
the test organisms that might lead to different results, perform 
reference toxicity tests with reagent grade DSS in addition to the usual 
control tests. Prepare a stock solution of DSS immediately before use by 
adding 1 gram of DSS per 500 ml of test water solution. Use exploratory 
tests before the full scale tests are begun to determine the amount of 
reference standard to be used in each of the five different 
concentrations.
    3.4.5 Number of organisms. At a minimum, 20 organisms of a given 
species are exposed for each test concentration. For the toxicity test 
procedures using Menidia, place 10 fish in each of two jars. For the 
toxicity tests using Mysidopsis, place 10 larvae in each of two 
containers.
    3.4.6 Transfer of organisms. Organisms should be handled as little 
as possible in order to minimize stress. Transfer Menidia and Mysidopsis 
from the acclimatization aquaria to the test chambers with a pipette or 
a wide-bore, smooth glass tube (4 to 8 mm internal diameter) fitted with 
a rubber bulb. Dip nets should be avoided when handling larval fish and 
mysids. Do not hold fish out of the water longer than necessary and 
discard any specimen accidentally dropped or otherwise mishandled during 
transfer.
    3.4.6.1 Mysidopsis. To have the mysids ready for study, mysids may 
be sorted 24 hours prior to initiation of the 48-hour test. Transfer the 
mysids to a beaker containing a small volume of water; this vessel 
serves as a holding chamber during randomized transfer of the organisms 
to test solutions. Mysids are randomly selected from the batch of mysids 
in the holding chamber, and transferred to 50-ml beakers containing a 
small volume of seawater. One mysid is added per beaker using a small 
piece of flexible 500-<greek-m>m screening until all of the beakers 
contain one mysid. The process of random selection and sorting is 
continued until the appropriate number of mysids has been delivered to 
each of the 50-ml beakers. The mysids are gently released from the 50-ml 
beakers into larger beakers filled with an appropriate volume of 20-ppt 
seawater (25  deg.C) to bring the total volume to 200 ml. The beakers 
are randomly placed into a temperature-controlled water bath to 
acclimate overnight at 25  deg.C. The mysids are transferred to larger 
beakers (1-liter) for the 48-hour test after the addition of 800 ml of 
the test solution. A total of 10 mysids per beaker are used for 48-hour 
acute toxicity tests. A minimum of two replicate chambers are used for 
each test concentration and control.
    3.4.6.2  Menidia and Mysidopsis are fed 50 brine shrimp nauplii/
organism daily during the 96-hour and 48-hour tests. Excess food should 
be removed daily by aspirating with a pipette.
    3.4.7  Test duration and observations. 3.4.7.1 Menidia. Observe the 
number of dead fish in each test container and record at the end of each 
24-hour period. Fish are considered dead upon cessation of respiratory 
and all other overt movements, whether spontaneous or in response to 
mild mechanical prodding. Remove dead fish as soon as observed. Also 
note and report when the behavior of test fish deviates from that of 
control fish. Such behavioral changes would include variations in 
opercular movement, coloration, body orientation, movement, depth in 
container, schooling tendencies, and others. Abnormal behavior of the 
test organisms (especially during the first 24 hours) is a desirable 
parameter to monitor in a toxicity test because changes in behavior and 
appearance may precede mortality. Toxicants can reduce an organism's 
ability to survive natural stresses. In these cases, the mortality is 
not directly attributed to the toxicant, but most certainly is an 
indirect effect. Reports on behavioral changes during a toxicity test 
can give insight into the non-acute effects of the tested material. At 
the end of the 96-hour period, terminate the fish tests and determine 
the LC<INF>50 values. The acute toxicity test is terminated after four 
days of exposure. The number of surviving fish are counted and recorded 
for each chamber in accordance with

[[Page 253]]

standard EPA methods (6). The LC<INF>50 is calculated using survival 
data from the test in accordance with the methods described in the 
guidelines (6).
    3.4.7.2   Mysidopsis. Terminate the mysid test after 48 hours of 
incubation. To count the dead animals accurately, place the exposure 
vessels on a light table such that light passes through the bottom of 
the vessel. Most of the dead mysids will be on the bottom of the beaker 
and can readily be seen against the background of the light table. Also 
search the top of the liquid for mysids trapped there by surface 
tension. Exercise caution when determining death of the animals. 
Occasionally, an animal appears dead, but closer observation shows 
slight movement of an appendage or a periodic spasm of its entire body. 
For these tests, animals exhibiting any movement when touched with a 
pipette tip are considered alive. Account for all test animals to ensure 
accuracy since Mysidopsis bahia may disintegrate or be cannibalized by 
other mysids. Consider individuals not accounted for as dead. At the end 
of 48 hours of exposure, terminate the mysid assay and determine the 
LC<INF>50 values in accordance with the methods described in the 
guidelines (6).
    3.4.8  Physical and chemical determinations. 3.4.8.1 Menidia. 
Determine the temperature, DO, and pH of the test solutions before the 
fish are added and at 24-, 48-, 72-, and 96-hour exposure intervals. It 
is necessary to take measurements from only one of the replicates of 
each of the toxicant series.
    3.4.8.2  Mysidopsis. Determine the temperature, DO, and pH of the 
test solutions before the nauplii are added and at the 24- and 48-hour 
exposure interval. Measure DO and pH in only one of the replicates of 
each of the toxicant series.
    3.4.9  Testing laboratory. An ordinary heated or air-conditioned 
laboratory room with thermostatic controls suitable for maintaining the 
prescribed test temperatures generally will suffice to conduct the 
toxicity tests. Where ambient temperatures cannot be controlled to 
25<plus-minus>1  deg.C, use water baths with the necessary temperature 
controls.
    3.4.10  Test containers. For tests with fish or mysids, use 1-liter 
glass beakers measuring approximately 10 cm in diameter. In conducting 
the test, add to each beaker 1 liter of the test solution or seawater 
formulation aerated to saturation with DO. To add the liter volume 
easily and accurately, use a large volume (1-liter) graduated cylinder. 
Process all required glassware before each test. Immerse in normal 
hexane for 10 minutes. Follow this with a thorough rinse with hot tap 
water; three hot detergent scrubs; an additional hot tap-water rinse; 
and three rinses with distilled water. Oven or air dry the glassware in 
a reasonably dust-free atmosphere.
    3.5  Preparation of test concentrations. 3.5.1  Menidia. Place test 
jars (approximately 22.5 cm in height, 15 cm in diameter, 11 cm in 
diameter at the mouth) containing 2 liters of synthetic seawater on a 
reciprocal shaker. The shaker platform should be adapted to hold firmly 
six of the toxicity test jars. Add the desired amount of the petroleum 
product (if applicable) under test directly to each test jar. Dispense 
the appropriate amount of toxicant (if applicable) into the jars with a 
pipette. Tightly cap the test jars and shake for 5 minutes at 
approximately 315 to 333 2-cm (0.75-inch) strokes per minute in a 
reciprocal shaker or at approximately 150 to 160 rpm on orbital shakers. 
At the completion of shaking, remove the jars from the shaker and 
dispense 1 liter of the mixture to each of the 1-liter glass beakers. 
Randomly place beakers in a constant-temperature water bath or room, 
take water quality measurements, add fish, and initiate aeration.
    3.5.2  Mysidopsis. 3.5.2.1  To prepare test solutions for products 
and oil/product mixtures, blend or mix the test solutions with an 
electric blender having: speeds of 10,000 rpm or less; a stainless-steel 
cutting assembly; and a 1-liter borosilicate jar. To minimize foaming, 
blend at speeds below 10,000 rpm.
    3.5.2.2  For the product test solution, add 550 ml of the synthetic 
seawater to the jar, then with the use of a gas-tight calibrated glass 
syringe with a Teflon-tipped plunger, add 0.55 ml of the product and mix 
for 5 seconds.
    3.5.2.3  For the oil test solution, add 550 ml of the synthetic 
seawater to the jar. Then with the use of a gas-tight calibrated glass 
syringe equipped with a Teflon-tipped plunger, add 0.55 ml of the oil 
and mix for 5 seconds.
    3.5.2.4  For the oil/product mixture, add 550 ml of the synthetic 
seawater to the mixing jar. While the blender is in operation, add 0.5 
ml of the oil under study with the use of a calibrated syringe with a 
Teflon-tipper plunger and then 0.05 ml of the product as indicated 
above. Blend for 5 seconds after addition of product. These additions 
provide test solutions of the product, oil, and the oil/product mixture 
at concentrations of 1,000 ppm.
    3.5.2.5  Immediately after the test solutions are prepared, draw up 
the necessary amount of test solution with a gas-tight Teflon-tipped 
glass syringe of appropriate size and dispense into each of the five 
containers in each series. If the series of five concentrations to be 
tested are 10, 18, 32, 56, and 100 ppm, the amount of the test solution 
in the order of the concentrations listed above would be as follows: 10, 
18, 32, 56, and 100 ml.
    3.5.2.6  Each time a syringe is to be filled for dispensing to the 
series of test containers, start the mixer and withdraw the desired 
amount in the appropriate syringe while the mixer is in operation. Turn 
off immediately

[[Page 254]]

after the sample is taken to limit the loss of volatiles.
    3.5.2.7  Use exploratory tests before the full-scale test is set up 
to determine the concentration of toxicant to be used in each of the 
five different concentrations. After adding the required amounts of 
liquid, bring the volume in each of the test containers up to 800 ml 
with the artificial seawater. To ensure keeping each of the series 
separate, designate on the lid of each container the date, the material 
under test, and its concentration.
    3.5.2.8  When the desired concentrations are prepared, gently 
release into each beaker the 10 test Mysidopsis (previously transferred 
into 200 ml of medium). This provides a volume of 1 liter in each test 
chamber. A pair of standard cover glass forceps with flat, bent ends is 
an ideal tool for handling and tipping the small beaker without risk of 
contaminating the medium.
    3.5.2.9  After adding the test animals, incubate the test beakers at 
25<plus-minus>1 deg.C for 48 hours. Recommended lighting is 2,000 
lumens/m\2\ (200 ft-c) of diffused, constant, fluorescent illumination.
    3.5.2.10  Wash the blender thoroughly after use and repeat the above 
procedures for each series of tests. Wash the blender as follows: rinse 
with normal hexane; pour a strong solution of laboratory detergent into 
the blender to cover the blades; fill the container to about half of its 
volume with hot tap water; operate the blender for about 30 seconds at 
high speed; remove and rinse twice with hot tap water, mixing each rinse 
for 5 seconds at high speed; and then rinse twice with distilled water, 
mixing each rinse for 5 seconds at high speed.
    3.6  Calculating and reporting. At the end of the test period, the 
toxicity tests are terminated and the LC<INF>50 values are determined.
    3.6.1  Calculations. The LC<INF>50 is the concentration lethal to 
50% of the test population. It can be calculated as an interpolated 
value based on percentages of organisms surviving at two or more 
concentrations, at which less than half and more than half survived. The 
LC<INF>50 can be estimated with the aid of computer programs or graphic 
techniques (log paper). The 95% confidence intervals for the LC<INF>50 
estimate should also be determined.
    3.6.2  Reporting. The test product and oil and their source and 
storage are described in the toxicity test report. Note any observed 
changes in the experimental water or the test solutions. Also include 
the species of fish used; the sources, size, and condition of the fish; 
data of any known treatment of the fish for disease or infestation with 
parasites before their use; and any observations on the fish behavior at 
regular intervals during the tests. In addition to the calculated 
LC<INF>50 values, other data necessary for interpretation (e.g., DO, pH, 
other physical parameters, and the percent survival at the end of each 
day of exposure at each concentration of toxicant) should be reported.
    3.7  Summary of procedures. 3.7.1  Menidia:
    1. Prepare adequate stocks of the appropriate standard dilution 
water.
    2. Add 2 liters of the standard dilution water to the test jars. 
Each test consists of 5 replicates of each of 5 concentrations of the 
test material, a control series of 5 beakers, and a standard reference 
series of 5 different concentrations for a total of 35 beakers. 
Simultaneous performance of toxicity tests on the oil, product, and oil/
product mixture requires a total of 105 beakers.
    3. Add the determined amount (quarter points on the log scale) of 
test material to the appropriate jars. Preliminary tests will be 
necessary to define the range of definitive test concentrations.
    4. Cap the jars tightly with the Teflon-lined screw caps and shake 
for 5 minutes at 315 to 333 2-cm (0.75-inch) strokes per minute on a 
reciprocal shaker.
    5. Remove the jars from the shaker, take water quality data, 
dispense 1 liter of solution to the 1-liter glass beaker, and add 10 
acclimated fish per beaker.
    6. Aerate with 100<plus-minus>15 bubbles per minute through a 1-ml 
serological pipette, as needed, to maintain DO above 4.0 mg/l.
    7. Observe and record mortalities, water quality, and behavioral 
changes every 24 hours.
    8. After 96 hours, terminate the test, and calculate LC<INF>50 
values and corresponding confidence limits.
    3.7.2  Mysidopsis:
    1. Initiate the procedure for hatching the Mysidopsis in sufficient 
time before the toxicity test is to be conducted so that 5-7 day old 
larvae are available.
    2. With the use of a small pipette, transfer 10 Mysidopsis into 
small beakers, each containing 200 ml of the proper synthetic seawater.
    3. To prepare the test stock product and oil solutions, add 550 ml 
of the artificial seawater to the prescribed blender jar. By means of a 
gas-tight glass syringe with a Teflon-tipped plunger, add 0.55 ml of the 
product (or oil) and mix at 10,000 rpm for 5 seconds. To prepare the 
test stock oil/product mixture, add 550 ml of the standard seawater to 
the blender jar. While the blender is in operation (10,000 rpm), add 0.5 
ml of the oil, then 0.05 ml of the product with the use of a calibrated 
syringe with a Teflon-tipped plunger. Blend for 5 seconds after adding 
the product. One ml of these stock solutions added to the 100 ml of 
standard seawater in the test containers yields a concentration of 10 
ppm product, oil, or oil/product combination (the test will be in a 
ratio of 1 part product to 10 parts of oil).
    4. Each test consists of 5 replications of each of 5 concentrations 
of the material

[[Page 255]]

under study, a control series of 5 beakers and a standard reference 
series of 5 different concentrations, for a total of 35 beakers. 
Simultaneous performance of toxicity tests on the oil, product, and oil/
product mixture requires a total of 105 beakers. Immediately after 
preparing the test solution of the product or oil/product solution, and 
using an appropriately sized syringe, draw up the necessary amount of 
test solution and dispense into each of the five containers in each 
series. Each time a syringe is to be filled for dispensing to the series 
of test containers, start the mixer and withdraw the desired amount in 
the appropriate syringe while the mixer is in operation. Turn mixer off 
immediately after the sample is taken to limit the loss of volatiles. 
After adding the required amount of the test oil/product or product 
mixture, bring the volume of liquid in each of the test containers up to 
800 ml with the artificial seawater. When the desired concentrations 
have been prepared, gently release into each beaker the 10 mysids 
previously transferred into 200 ml of medium. This provides a volume of 
1 liter in each test chamber.
    5. Wash the blender as prescribed for each series of tests.
    6. Incubate the test beakers at 25<plus-minus>1 deg.C for 48 hours 
with the prescribed lighting.
    7. Terminate the experiment after 48 hours, observe and record the 
mortalities, and determine the LC<INF>50s and corresponding confidence 
limits.

              4.0  Bioremediation agent effectiveness test

    4.1  Summary of method. The bioremediation agent effectiveness 
testing protocol is designed to determine a product's ability to 
biodegrade oil by quantifying changes in the oil composition resulting 
from biodegradation. The protocol tests for microbial activity and 
quantifies the disappearance of saturated hydrocarbons and polynuclear 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The sample preparation procedure extracts 
the oil phase into dichloromethane (DCM), with a subsequent solvent 
exchange into hexane. To effectively accomplish the goals of the testing 
protocol, it is necessary to normalize the concentration of the various 
analytes in oil to a non-biodegradable marker, either C<INF>2-or 
C<INF>3-phenanthrene, C<INF>2-chrysene, or hopane <SUP>1 (7). The test 
method targets the relatively easy to degrade normal alkanes and the 
more resistant and toxic PAHs. It normalizes their concentrations to 
C<INF>2-or C<INF>3-phenanthrene, C<INF>2-chrysene, or 
C<INF>3017<greek-a>(H), 21<greek-b> (H)-hopane on an oil weight basis 
(mg marker/kg oil, mg target analyte/kg oil). The analytical technique 
uses a high resolution gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) 
because of its high degree of chemical separation and spectral 
resolution. GC/MS has long been used to study the weathering and fate of 
oil spilled into the environment. For quantitative analyses, the 
instrument is operated in the selective ion detection (SIM) mode at a 
scan rate of greater than 1.5 scans per second to maximize the linear 
quantitative range and precision of the instrument. The sample 
preparation method does not exclude analysis of selected samples by GC/
MS in the full scanning mode of operation to qualitatively assess 
changes in the oil not accounted for by the SIM approach. Performed 
concurrently with the chemical analysis described above is a 
microbiological analysis. The microbiological analysis is performed to 
determine and monitor the viability of the microbial cultures being 
studied. Under this procedure, microbial enumerations of hydrocarbon 
degraders are performed at each sampling event using a microtiter Most 
Probable Number (MPN) determination.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Although any of these biomarkers can be used to conduct this 
test, it is recommended that hopane be used.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    4.2  Apparatus. The following materials and equipment are required 
for the protocol: Appropriate flasks and other glassware; sterile tubes; 
graduated cylinders (100-ml); deionized water; p-iodonitrotetrazolium 
violet dye; weighing pans or paper; 250-ml borosilicate glass Erlenmeyer 
flasks with screw tops; Pasteur pipettes; laboratory notebook; 
microtiter MPN plates (24-well) multi-channel pipetting device; dilution 
tube and caps; autoclave; environmental room or incubator; balance 
accurate to 0.1 mg (XD-400); GC/MS instrument equipped with a DB-5 
capillary column (30 m, 0.25-mm I.D., and 0.25-<greek-m>m film 
thickness) and a split/splitless injection port operating in the 
splitless mode, such as Hewlett-Packard 5890/5971 GC/MS (recommended for 
use); and an autosampler for testing multiple samples.
    4.3  Reagents and culture medium. 4.3.1  Preparation of seawater. 
All products are tested in clean natural seawater. Clean natural 
seawater means that the source of this seawater must not be heavily 
contaminated with industrial or other types of effluent. For example, 
seawater should not be obtained from a source near shipping channels or 
discharges of industrial or municipal wastewater, or with high 
turbidity. The seawater is used within seven days of collection. No 
microbial inoculum is added.
    4.3.2  Preparation of oil. A medium weight crude oil, Alaska North 
Slope (ANS), is artificially weathered by heating to 521 deg.F to remove 
the light end hydrocarbons prior to experimental start-up (ANS 521). The 
method is described in the Draft International Standard ISO/DIS 8708 
``Crude Petroleum Oil--Determination of Distillation Characteristics 
Using 15 Theoretical Plates Columns'' by the International Organization 
for Standardization (8). The ANS521 crude oil can be obtained from the 
National Environmental Technology Applications Center's (NETAC)

[[Page 256]]

Bioremediation Products Evaluation Center (BPEC), University of 
Pittsburgh Applied Research Center, 615 William Pitt Way, Pittsburgh, 
PA, 15238, (412) 826-5511. The crude oil is heated to 190 deg.C 
(374 deg.F) under atmospheric pressure. The system is then cooled and 
placed under vacuum (or under an atmospheric pressure of 20 mm Hg) for 
the final distillation to an atmospheric equivalent boiling point of 
272 deg.C (521 deg.F).
    4.3.3  Preparation of mineral nutrient solution. If a commercial 
product is strictly a microbial agent and does not contain its own 
nutrients, a mineral nutrient solution will be provided if requested by 
the product manufacturer or vendor. If a commercial product contains its 
own nutrients, no further nutrients will be added. The nutrient solution 
is a modified salt solution and is described below.
    4.3.3.1  Nutrient preparation:
    1. N&P Salts. The following salts are added to distilled water and 
made up to a 1,000-ml volume. Adjust final pH to 7.8. The solution is 
sterilized by autoclaving at 121 deg.C at 15 psig for 20 minutes or by 
filtering through a sterile 0.22 <greek-m>m membrane filter.

Na<INF>2HPO<INF>4.2H<INF>2--18.40 g
KNO<INF>3--76.30 g

    2. MgSO<INF>4.7H<INF>2O solution. Dissolve 22.50 g in 1,000 ml 
distilled water. The solution is sterilized by autoclaving at 121 deg.C 
at 15 psig for 20 minutes.
    3. CaCl<INF>2 solution. Dissolve 27.50 g in 1,000 ml of distilled 
water. The solution is sterilized by autoclaving at 121 deg.C at 15 psig 
for 20 minutes.
    4. FeCl<INF>3<bullet>6H<INF>2O solution. Dissolve 0.25 g in 1,000 ml 
of distilled water. The solution is sterilized by autoclaving at 
121 deg.C at 15 psig for 20 minutes.
    5. Trace Element Solution. The following salts are added to 
distilled water and made up to a 1,000-ml volume. The solution is 
sterilized by autoclaving at 121 deg.C at 15 psig for 20 minutes.

MnSO<INF>4.H<INF>2O--30.2 mg
H<INF>3BO<INF>3--57.2 mg
ZnSO<INF>4.7H<INF>2O--42.8 mg
(NH<INF>4)6Mo<INF>7(O<INF>2)<INF>4--34.7 mg

    The pH of the nutrient solution is adjusted with a pH meter 
calibrated at room temperature (approximately 25  deg.C) using 
commercial buffers of pH 4.0, 7.0, and 10.0 (Fisher Scientific), as 
appropriate, prior to use. The pH is adjusted with concentrated HCl or 
10 M NaOH, as appropriate.
    4.3.3.2  Final concentrations: Ten (10) ml of solution 1 and 2 ml of 
solutions 2-5 are added to non-sterile seawater and made up to a 1,000-
ml volume immediately prior to test start-up. This seawater/mineral 
nutrient solution is used for all flasks containing products requiring 
nutrient supplements and for the flasks containing no commercial 
additive. Seawater without the above nutrient solutions is used for 
products containing their own source of nutrients.
    4.4  Pretest preparation.
    4.4.1  Experimental setup.
    4.4.1.1  The procedure consists of an experimental shaker flask 
setup and the specific set of microbiological and chemical analyses that 
are performed on individual product samples. The following test flasks 
(labeled with unique identifiers) are prepared and set up on a gyratory 
shaker at day 0 to reflect the following treatment design:

    4.4.1.2  For each test, a sheet listing the number of flasks, types 
of controls, number of replicates, product to be tested, and other 
information is prepared. The following steps should be adhered to for 
the experimental setup:
    1. Borosilicate glass Erlenmeyer flasks (250-ml) are thoroughly 
cleaned and autoclaved for 20 minutes at 120  deg.C at 15 psi, then 
dried in the drying oven.
    2. Flasks are labeled with the appropriate code: product or control, 
sample day, and letter indicating replicate.
    3. 100 ml of seawater is added to each flask.
    4. For nutrient and product treatments that require the addition of 
nutrients, seawater containing the nutrient solution is prepared.
    5. Pasteur pipettes should be sterilized in advance. Break off the 
tip to provide a larger opening prior to sterilization.
    6. Pour the approximate amount of oil to be used from the large 
stock bottle into a sterile beaker. Keep the beaker covered when oil is 
not being removed.

[[Page 257]]

    7. The labeled flasks containing seawater and other additions, as 
necessary, are placed on the balance. The flask is tared. The 
appropriate amount of oil (0.5 g) is added drop by drop using a sterile 
Pasteur pipette with the tip broken off to provide a wider opening. Care 
is taken to avoid splashing the oil or getting it on the sides of 
flasks. Precautions are taken when handling and charging the flasks to 
minimize the likelihood of contamination by exogenous microbes. This 
includes using a new sterile pipette for each series of flasks.
    8. The weight of the oil is recorded in the laboratory notebook.
    9. The product is prepared and added to the appropriate flasks 
according to the manufacturer's or vendor's instructions.
    10. Flasks are carried upright and carefully placed in the holders 
on the shaker table to minimize the amount of oil that might adhere to 
the side of the flasks. Flasks in which a significant amount of oil is 
splashed on the sides are redone.
    11. The prepared flasks are shaken at 200 rpm at 20 deg.C until such 
time that they will be removed for sampling.
    4.4.2  Sampling. The control and treatments (nutrient and product 
flasks) are sampled three times over a 28-day period: day 0, day 7, and 
day 28. The entire flask is sacrificed for analysis; a 0.5-ml aliquot is 
removed from each flask for the microbiological analysis and the 
remainder of each flask is used for the chemical analysis. Specific 
procedures for both the microbiological and chemical analysis are 
described below. At the time of each sampling event, physical 
observations of each flask should be recorded.
    4.5  Microbiological analysis. To monitor the viability of the 
microbial cultures being studied, microbial enumerations of hydrocarbon 
degraders are performed at each sampling event using a microtiter MPN 
determination. This is used as an indicator of the relative change in 
biomass. This test design relies on using growth response as an 
indication of enhanced activity as compared to a ``no addition'' 
control.
    4.5.1  Media preparation. Media for microbial enumerations are 
carefully prepared according to manufacturer's or other instructions and 
sterilized using appropriate methods.
    4.5.1.1  General media treatment: Buy Bushnell-Haas (B-H) broth in 
quantities to last no longer than one year. Use media on a first-in, 
first-out basis. When practical, buy media in quarter-pound multiples, 
rather than one-pound multiples to keep supply sealed as long as 
possible. Keep an inventory of media, including kind, amount, lot 
number, expiration date, date received, and date opened. Check inventory 
before reordering media. Discard media that are caked, discolored, or 
show other deterioration.
    4.5.1.2  Sterile saline (pH adjusted):
    1. Weigh 30 g of NaCl.
    2. Dissolve in enough water to make 1,000 ml.
    3. Adjust pH to 8.0 with NaOH (10M and 0.5M).
    4. Sterilize by autoclaving for 15 minutes at 15 psig.
    4.5.1.3  Standard nutrient concentrate (add 1 ml to each 100 ml of 
Bushnell-Haas medium for MPNs):
    1. Weigh compounds listed below, dissolve in DIH<INF>2O, dilute to 1 
liter.

Potassium Phosphate, monobasic KH<INF>2PO<INF>4--0.633 g
Potassium Phosphate, dibasic K<INF>2HPO<INF>4--1.619 g
Sodium Phosphate, dibasic Na<INF>2HPO<INF>4--2.486 g
Ammonium Chloride NH<INF>4Cl--3.850 g
Magnesium Sulfate, heptahydrate MgSO<INF>4<bullet>7H<INF>2O--4.500 g
Calcium Chloride, dihydrate CaCl<INF>2<bullet>2H<INF>2O--7.290 g
Ferric Chloride, hexahydrate FeCl<INF>3<bullet>6H<INF>2O--0.250 g

Trace Elements

Manganese Sulfate, monohydrate MnSO<INF>2<bullet>H<INF>2O--6.04 mg
Boric Acid H<INF>3Bo<INF>3--11.44 mg
Zinc Sulfate, heptahydrate ZnSO<INF>4<bullet>7H<INF>2O--8.56 mg
Ammonium Moybdate, tetrahydrate 
          (NH<INF>4)6Mo<INF>7O<INF>24<bullet>4H<INF>2O--6.94 mg
    2. Adjust pH to 6.0.
    3. Stir solution for approximately 3 hours, then filter through a 
Buchner funnel using #1 paper, which will retain approximately 3.8 g of 
insolubles.
    4. Then filter through a 0.45 micron filter into sterile bottles.
    5. Cap bottles, label, and store in refrigerator until used.
    4.5.1.4   Quality assurance/Quality control (QA/QC):
    1. Periodically check the effectiveness of sterilization using 
commercially available tapes or Bacillus stearothermophilus spore 
suspensions, following the instructions with these products.
    2. Maintain a media log book that includes the dates, kinds and 
amounts of media made, pH, and any problems or observations.
    3. Before use, check plates and tubes for signs of contamination, 
drying, or other problems.
    4.5.1.5  Safety/Special precautions:
    1. Note any safety or other precautions for particular media.
    2. Note precautions to be followed when using the autoclave.
    3. Use gloves and other protective clothes when handling media.
    4. Use care in handling hot media.
    4.5.2  Microbial enumeration. Standardized techniques for performing 
Most Probable

[[Page 258]]

Number microbial enumerations are described below.
    4.5.2.1  Dilutions:
    1. Prior to sacrificing each flask, remove 0.5 ml of water from each 
flask and add it to a tube of 4.5 ml sterile phosphate buffer (1:10 
dilution) as prepared in the Standard Methods for the Examination of 
Water and Wastewater (9). Using sterile technique, mix and perform 
serial dilutions (0.5 ml of previous dilution to 4.5 ml of sterile 
phosphate buffer) to 10<SUP>-9 dilution.
4.5.2.2  Inoculating MPN plates (oil degrader):
    1. Prepare sufficient sterile 0.4 M NaCl (23.4 g NaCl/1,000 ml B-H) 
and B-H at pH 7.0 to fill the number of wells required for the test 
(1.75 ml/well).
    2. Using sterile technique, add 1.75 ml of B-H broth to each well.
    3. Label the top of the plate with the proper dilution for each row.
    4. Add 0.1 ml of fluid from each dilution tube to each well in the 
appropriate row, starting with the most dilute.
    5. After adding the fluid to all the wells, add 20 <greek-m>l of 
sterilized No. 2 fuel oil to the top of each well.
    6. Incubate each plate at 20 deg.C.
    7. After 14 days of incubation, add 100 <greek-m>l of p-
iodotetrazolium violet dye (50 mg/10 ml of D.I. water) to each well to 
determine growth.
    8. View plates against a white background to determine if color is 
present. Development of a purple or pink color upon standing for 45 
minutes constitutes a positive test.
    9. Record the number of positive wells and the dilutions at which 
they occur.
    10. Enter data into a computerized enumeration method using ``MPN 
Calculator'' software program (version 2.3 or higher) by Albert J. Klee, 
U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development, Risk Reduction Engineering 
Laboratory, Cincinnati, OH.
    4.5.2.3  Quality assurance/Quality control:
    1. Check pH of medium before preparing wells (pH should be 
approximately 8.0). Adjust pH, if necessary, with dilute NaOH.
    2. Keep prepared tetrazolium violet dye solution in the refrigerator 
in an amber bottle when not in use.
    3. Have all laboratory personnel periodically run MPNs on the same 
sample to test precision.
    4.5.2.4  Safety/Special precautions:
    1. Use sterile technique in preparing solutions, dilutions, plates, 
and MPN wells.
    2. Do not pipette potentially hazardous solutions by mouth.
    3. Autoclave all plates and wells before discarding.
    4.6  Chemical analysis of oil composition.
    4.6.1  Sample procedure. After 0, 7, and 28 days of incubation on a 
rotary shaker, the appropriate flasks are sacrificed and extracted with 
dichloromethane and spiked with a surrogate recovery standard. A 10-ml 
aliquot of the DCM layer is used for the gravimetric analysis. If 
significant biodegradation is evident in the results of the gravimetric 
analysis, then a solvent exchange into hexane takes place prior to the 
GC/MS analysis. Follow steps 1-19 below when preparing for the chemical 
analysis.
    1. After 0, 7, and 28 days of rotary shaking and incubating at 
20 deg.C, the reaction vessels are sacrificed. Prior to the chemical 
analysis, a 0.5-ml sample of the aqueous phase is removed for the 
microbiological analysis (see Microbial Enumeration above).
    2. A surrogate recovery standard is prepared in the following 
manner: 1,000 mg of d<INF>10-phenanthrene and 1,000 mg of 5<greek-a>-
androstane are measured into a 500-ml volumetric flask and DCM is added 
to the mark to produce a 2,000-ng/<greek-m>l stock solution.
    3. A 100-<greek-m>l aliquot of the surrogate solution is added to 
each test flask. The final concentration of surrogates in each flask is 
approximately 4 ng/<greek-m>l of solvent in the final extract. The 
aliphatics and marker data should be corrected for percent recovery of 
the 5<greek-a>-androstane surrogate and the aromatics for the d<INF>10-
phenanthrene surrogate.
    4. The contents of the flask are placed into a 250-ml separatory 
funnel.
    5. Measure a total volume of 50 ml DCM for use in the extraction. 
Use 3 10-ml fractions to rinse the flask into the funnel and transfer 
the remaining aliquot of DCM to the funnel.
    6. Stopper and mix vigorously by shaking (approximately 50 times) 
while ventilating properly.
    7. Each funnel is set aside to allow the DCM and water layers to 
partition. This may take 5-10 minutes for some products, or up to 3 
hours if the product has caused the formation of an emulsion.
    8. Drain the first 10 ml of the DCM (bottom) layer, collect, cap, 
uniquely label, and use for gravimetric analysis (see below). Drain the 
remaining 40 ml and dry it by passing it through a funnel packed with 
anhydrous sodium sulfate.
    9. Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (KD) concentrator by attaching a Snyder 
column to an evaporation flask with a graduated concentrator tube. Align 
vertically and partially immerse concentrator tube in a water bath (10). 
Set the water bath to the appropriate temperature to maintain proper 
distillation.
    10. Collect the de-watered extract into the KD concentrator.
    11. Evaporate DCM to approximately 10 ml, then add approximately 50 
ml of the exchange solvent (hexane) and concentrate the volume to 10 ml.
    12. Rinse the flask into the concentrator tube with 50 ml hexane and 
concentrate to 10 ml. Repeat one more time with 50 ml of hexane.
    13. Remove concentrator tube with the recovered 10 ml of sample 
volume. The heavier

[[Page 259]]

residual material should be present as a precipitate (bottom layer).
    14. Centrifuge to aid the separation of the hexane from the 
precipitant fraction.
    15. Place hexane-soluble fraction (top layer)--approximately 1.0 
ml--into a GC/MS vial for analysis (see GC/MS Analysis Procedure below). 
If column fouling and deterioration of separation characteristics occur, 
an alumina column sample cleanup method can be considered (see 
Alternative GC/MS Sample Cleanup Procedure below).
    16. Analyze by GC/MS using the conditions determined by the U.S. EPA 
Risk Reduction Engineering Laboratory, Water and Hazardous Waste 
Treatment Research Division, in Cincinnati, OH, which follows U.S. EPA 
Method 8270 (see GC/MS Analysis Procedure below).
    17. Calculate surrogate recovery. If surrogate recovery is less than 
85 percent for the marker relative to the surrogate recovery standard 
(d<INF>10-phenanthrene), then the water layer should be extracted again 
using three separate extractions with DCM. Pool the three extractions 
with original extract and concentrate to 10 ml, and reanalyze by GC/MS.
    18. Drain the seawater into a storage sample vial/container.
    19. Seal the vial with a Teflon-lined cap and store frozen. This 
water layer is kept in case additional extractions are necessary.
    4.6.2 Gravimetric analysis. The initial means to evaluate the 
effectiveness of a bioremediation agent for oil spill response is 
through gravimetric analysis. A statistically significant difference (p 
< 0.05) in analytical weight of the oil from the control system as 
compared to the analytical weight of the oil treated with a 
bioremediation agent indicates biodegradation has successfully occurred. 
Hence, the disappearance of oil should be accompanied by significant 
decreases in total oil residue weight of extractable materials versus a 
control. If no significant decrease in oil residue weight is observed, 
the need to perform further chemical analysis should be evaluated. 
Follow steps 1-3 to conduct the gravimetric analysis.
    1. The 10 ml of DCM extract (from Sample Procedure step 8 above) is 
placed in a small vial and concentrated to dryness by nitrogen blowdown 
techniques using a steady stream of nitrogen (pre-purified gas). If the 
oil is severely biodegraded, a larger volume of DCM (>10 ml) may be 
necessary for the gravimetric analysis.
    2. The residue is weighed 3 times for the gravimetric weight of oil. 
Record the weight of the oil.
    3. Compare statistically (p < 0.05) the weight of the product 
treatment versus the weight of the control from each respective time 
period. If a significant decrease is observed in the sampling (flask 
containing bioremediation agent) weight, then proceed with the remainder 
of the sample procedure.
    4.6.3  GC/MS analysis. Often, analysis of saturated and aromatic 
hydrocarbons by capillary gas chromatography of DCM extracts leads to 
column fouling and deterioration of separation characteristics. An 
alternative, simple ``one-step'' alumina sample cleanup procedure can be 
performed on oil before injection; this cleanup removes both asphaltenes 
and polar compounds and can be applied to DCM extracts as well. This 
procedure is described in steps 1-11 below.
    4.6.3.1  Alternative GC/MS sample cleanup procedure:
    1. Weigh 4.0 g alumina (neutral, 80-200 mesh) into scintillation 
vials covered loosely with aluminum foil caps. Prepare one scintillation 
vial per sample. Heat for 18 hours at 300 deg.C or longer. Place in a 
desiccator of silica until needed.
    2. Add 5.0 ml of DCM to a glass luerlok multi-fit syringe (e.g., BD 
#2471) with stopcock (e.g., Perfectum #6021) in closed position, 
stainless steel syringe needle (18 gauge), and PTFE frits. Clamp in a 
vertical position.
    3. Transfer 4.0 g of prepared alumina to a plastic weighing boat and 
fill syringe slowly while applying continuous vibration (e.g., Conair 
#HM 11FF1).
    4. Add a second PTFE frit and push into place on top of the alumina 
bed.
    5. Drain 5.0 ml DCM to the top level of the column frit to await 
sample addition and discard DCM.
    6. Weigh 50 mg <plus-minus> 0.1 mg ANS521 oil into a tared vial.
    7. Premeasure 10 ml of DCM into a graduated cylinder. Add 0.2 to 0.3 
ml of the DCM to the tared oil vial. Mix and transfer solvent to the 
column bed with a Pasteur pipette. Open stopcock and collect in a 10-ml 
volumetric flask. Repeat until approximately 1.0 ml (do not exceed 1.0 
ml) of DCM has rinsed the vial and inner walls of the syringe body into 
the 10-ml flask.
    8. Transfer balance of DCM from the graduated cylinder to the column 
and regulate the solvent flow rate to approximately 1 to 2 ml/minute. 
Collect all eluent in the 10-ml flask.
    9. Transfer a known volume of eluent to another scintillation vial 
and blow down to dryness (nitrogen).
    10. Determine and record weight.
    11. Dissolve in 1.0 ml hexane for the GC/MS analysis procedure (see 
below).
    4.6.3.2  GC/MS analysis procedure:
    Immediately prior to injection, an internal standard solution of 
four deuterated compounds is spiked into the sample extracts and 
injected. Samples are quantified using the internal standard technique 
(10) for both the aliphatic and aromatic fractions of the oil extracts 
in order to provide sufficient information that the oil is being 
degraded. To

[[Page 260]]

help ensure that the observed decline in target analytes is caused by 
biodegradation rather than by physical loss from mishandling or 
inefficient extraction, it is necessary to normalize the concentrations 
of the target analytes via a ``conserved internal marker.'' Conserved 
internal markers that have been found useful for quantification are 
C<INF>2- or C<INF>3-phenanthrene, C<INF>2-chrysene, and 
C<INF>3017<greek-a>(H),21<greek-b>(H)-hopane. Deuterated internal 
standards are used to calculate the relative response factor (RRF) for 
the target analyte(s). To compute the ``normalized concentrations,'' the 
target analyte concentration at a given sampling time is simply divided 
by the selected conserved analyte concentration at the same sampling 
time (11). Conduct the GC/MS analysis using the following procedure.
    1. One (1) ml of the hexane extract (from Sample Procedure step 15 
above) is placed into a 1.5-ml vial for use on the autosampler of the 
GC/MS instrument.
    2. To this solution, 20 <greek-m>l of a 500-ng/<greek-m>l solution 
of the internal standards is added and the vial is capped for injection. 
The final concentration of the internal standards in each sample is 10 
ng/<greek-m>l. This solution contains 4 deuterated compounds: d<INF>8-
naphthalene, d<INF>10-anthracene, d<INF>12-chrysene, and d<INF>12-
perylene.
    3. At the start of any analysis period, the mass spectrometer (MS) 
is tuned to PFTBA by an autotune program, such as the Hewlett-Packard 
quicktune routine, to reduce operator variability. Set the GC/MS in the 
SIM mode at a scan rate of 1.5 scans/second to maximize the linear 
quantitative range and precision of the instrument. Set all other 
conditions to those specified in Instrument Configuration and 
Calibration section below.
    4. An instrument blank and a daily standard are analyzed prior to 
analysis of unknowns. Internal standards are combined with the sample 
extracts and coinjected with each analysis to monitor the instrument's 
performance during each run.
    5. Information that should be included on the acquisition form 
include operator's name and signature, date of extraction, date and time 
of autotune, date of injection(s), instrument blank, daily standard mix 
injection, GC column number, and standards for the 5-point calibration 
curve.
    6. If the instrument is operated for a period of time greater than 
12 hours, the tune will be checked and another daily standard analyzed 
prior to continuing with analyses.

    7. The MS is calibrated using a modified version of EPA Method 8270 
(10). Specifically, the concentrations of internal standards are 10 ng/
<greek-m>l instead of 40 ng/<greek-m>l. A five-point calibration curve 
is obtained for each compound listed in Table 6 prior to sample analysis 
at 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 ng/<greek-m>l. A 5-point calibration must be 
conducted on a standard mix of compounds to determine RRFs for the 
analytes. The standard mix (excluding the marker) for this calibration 
curve may be obtained from Absolute Standards, Inc., 498 Russell St., 
New Haven, CT, 06513, (800) 368-1131. If 
C<INF>3017<greek-b>(H),21<greek-a>(H)-hopane is used, it may be obtained 
from Dr. Charles Kennicutt II, Geochemical and Environmental Research 
Group, Texas A&M University, 833 Graham Rd., College Station, TX, 77845, 
(409) 690-0095.
    8. Calculate each compound's relative response factor to its 
corresponding deuterated internal standard indicated above, using the 
following equation:

RRF=(A<INF>xC<INF>is)/(A<INF>isC<INF>x)(6)

where:

RRF=relative response factor
A<INF>x=peak area of the characteristic ion for the compound being 
          measured (analyte)
A<INF>is=peak area of the characteristic ion for the specific internal 
          standard
C<INF>x=concentration of the compound being measured (ng/<greek-m>l)

[[Page 261]]

C<INF>is=concentration of the specific internal standard (10 ng/
          <greek-m>l). (This concentration is a constant in this 
          equation for the calibration curve.)

    9. Identify each analyte based on the integrated abundance from the 
primary characteristic ion indicated in Table 7.
    10. Quantitate each analyte using the internal standard technique. 
The internal standard used shall be the one nearest the retention time 
of that of a given analyte (Table 8).

    11. Use equation 7 to calculate the concentration of analytes in ng/
mg (ppm) oil:

Concentration (ng/mg)=(A<INF>xI<INF>sV<INF>t x  1,000)/
          (A<INF>is(RRF)V<INF>iM<INF>o)(7)

where:

A<INF>x=peak area of characteristic ion for compound being measured
I<INF>s=amount of internal standard injected, in ng (i.e., 20 ng)
V<INF>t=volume of the total DCM extract (50 ml)
A<INF>is=peak area of the characteristic ion of the internal standard
RRF=relative response factor
V<INF>i=volume of the extract injected (2 <greek-m>l)
M<INF>o=total mass of the oil added to the flask, mg

    12. Compute the ``normalized concentrations'' for each target 
analyte concentration at a given sampling time (equation 7) by simply 
dividing by the conserved internal marker concentration at the same 
sampling time.
    4.6.4  Generally accepted laboratory procedures. Samples are 
immediately logged into the laboratory, where they will be given a 
unique sample identification based on Julian data and the number logged 
in. Prior to the analysis of any experimental samples, a five-point 
standard curve is prepared. One of the mid-range standard curve 
concentration levels is analyzed daily before sample analysis as a 
continuing standard. RRFs for all target analytes should be within 25% 
of the standard curve response values at day 0, and at any sampling 
event the check standard percent difference from the initial five-point 
calibration must not exceed 20% between the before and after daily 
standard mix (see below). The collected GC/MS data are initially 
processed by a macro routine, which performs extracted chromatographic 
plots of the target compounds, integrates the target compounds, and 
shows integration results to include tabular numbers. The integration 
values are then transferred to a spreadsheet format to be quantified. 
Because of the complexity of the analyte matrix (oil), a very high 
degree of manual verification and reintegration of the spectral data is 
required.
    4.6.5  QA/QC procedures. The reliability of this method is dependent 
on the QA/QC procedures followed. Before and after each analytical batch 
(approximately 10 samples), analyze one procedural blank, one duplicate, 
and one calibration verification standard (10 ng/<greek-m>l). Analyze 
one reference crude oil standard. The instrument's performance and 
reproducibility are validated routinely in this manner. Surrogate 
recoveries should be within 70 to 120%, and duplicate relative percent 
difference values should be <plus-minus>20%. A control chart of the 
standard oil should be prepared and monitored. Variations of analytes in 
the control chart should be no more than 25% from the historical 
averages. Injection port discrimination for n-C25 and greater alkanes 
must be carefully monitored; the ratio of RRF n-C32/RRF n-C21 alkanes 
should not be allowed to fall below 80%. The mass discrimination can be 
reduced by replacing the quartz liner in the injection port after every 
analytical batch. The instrument's performance and reproducibility are 
validated routinely by analyzing the reference crude oil standard. All 
analyses are recorded in instrument logs detailing operating conditions, 
date and time, file name, etc. After analysis, the sample extracts are 
archived at refrigeration temperatures. To document QA/QC, the following 
information is contained in the detailed quantitative reports: average 
RRF derived from the standard curve; RRF from the daily standard; 
percent relative standard deviation; area of target analyte; 
concentration determined both on a weight and volume basis; and values 
for any surrogates and internal standards.
    4.6.6  Instrument configuration and calibration. A 2-ml aliquot of 
the hexane extract prepared by the above procedure is injected into a 
GC/MS instrument, such as the Hewlett-Packard 5890/5971 GC/MS 
(recommended for use). This instrument should be equipped with a DB-5 
capillary column (30 m, 0.25-mm I.D., and 0.25-<greek-m>m film 
thickness) and a split/splitless injection port operating in the 
splitless mode. Table 9 summarizes the temperature program used for the 
analysis. This temperature program has been optimized to give the best 
separation and sensitivity for analysis of the desired compounds on the 
instrument. Prior to the sample analysis, a five-point calibration must 
be conducted on a standard mix of the compounds listed in Table 7 to 
determine RRFs for the analyses.

    4.7  Statistical analysis. The determination of a bioremediation 
agent's effectiveness will be partially based upon the results of a 
statistical analysis of the shaker flask experiment. The experimental 
design for this test is a two factorial design. This two-way analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) will be used to determine data trends. The statistical 
method is designed to test various types of bioremediation treatments 
including microbial, nutrient, enzyme, and combination products. The 
following is a summary of the statistical

[[Page 263]]

methods to be used to evaluate the analytical data obtained from all 
product tests. The experimental design, data analysis methodology, 
interpretation of results, required documentation, and a numeric example 
are outlined below.
    4.7.1  Experimental design. The experimental design for this test is 
known as a factorial experiment with two factors. The first factor is 
product/control group; the second factor is time (measured in days). For 
example, if two groups (product A and a non-nutrient control) are tested 
at each of three points in time (day 0, 7, and 28), the experiment is 
called a 2x3 factorial experiment. There will be three replications 
(replicated shaker flasks) of each group-time combination.
    4.7.2  Data analysis methods. For each analyte and each product 
used, a product is considered a success by the demonstration of a 
statistically significant difference between the mean analyte 
degradation by the product and the mean analyte degradation by the non-
nutrient control. Such a determination will be made by performing an 
ANOVA on the sample data. The technical aspects of this procedure are 
outlined in Snedecor and Cochran (12). Most statistical software 
packages support the use of two-way ANOVA. However, the format required 
for the input data differs among the various commercial packages. 
Whichever package is used, the following ANOVA table will be provided as 
part of the output. In the Degree of Freedom column of Table 10, p = the 
number of product/control groups, t = the number of days at which each 
group is analyzed, and n = the number of replications. For the example 
of the 2x3 factorial experiment discussed above, p=2, t=3, and n=3. The 
significance of the F-statistics (as indicated by their corresponding p-
values) are used to interpret the analysis.

    4.7.3  Interpretation. 4.7.3.1 If the F-statistic for the 
interaction is significant at the 0.05 level (i.e., p-value is less than 
0.05), the data indicate that the mean response of at least two groups 
being tested differ for at least one point in time. In order to find out 
which groups and at which points in time the difference occurs, pairwise 
comparisons between the group means should be conducted for all time 
points. These comparisons can be made using protected least squared 
difference (LSD) or Dunnett mean separation techniques. The protected 
LSD procedure is detailed in Snedecor and Cochran (12); the Dunnett 
procedure is outlined in Montgomery (13). For both methods, the mean 
square error (MSE) from the two-way ANOVA table should be used to 
compute the separation values.
    4.7.3.2  If the F-statistic for the interaction is not significant 
at the 0.05 level (i.e., p-value not less than 0.05), but the F-
statistic for the group is significant (i.e., p-value is less than 
0.05), the data indicate that any differences that exist among the group 
means are consistent across time. To find out which group means differ, 
a pairwise comparison of the group means should be carried out by 
pooling data across all points in time. Again, the MSE from the two-way 
ANOVA table should be used to compute the separation values.
    4.7.3.3  If the F-statistic corresponding to both interaction and 
group are not significant at the 0.05 level, the data indicate no 
difference between the group means at any point in time. In this case, 
no further analysis is necessary.
    4.7.3.4  Finally, Snedecor and Cochran (12) use caution concerning 
the use of multiple comparisons. If many such comparisons are being 
conducted, then about 5% of the tested differences will erroneously be 
concluded as significant. The researcher must guard against such 
differences causing undue attention.
    4.7.4  Required documentation. 4.7.4.1 The following documents 
should be included to summarize the findings from a product test.
    1. Data listings for each analyte that was analyzed. These should 
show all raw data.
    2. A table of summary statistics for each analyte. The table should 
include the mean, standard deviation, and sample size for each group at 
each day.
    3. An ANOVA table for each analyte. The table should be of the same 
format as Table 10.
    4. A clear summary of the mean separations (if mean separations were

    4.7.4.5  From Table 13, it can be seen that the F-statistic for 
interaction is significant (F=61.39, p=0.0001). This indicates that 
group differences exist for one or more days. Protected LSD mean 
separations were then conducted for each day to determine which group 
differences exist. The results are summarized in Table 14. Note that 
means with the same letter (T grouping) are not significantly different.

    4.7.4.6  The grouping letters indicate that the product mean values 
(group 3) at day 7 and day 28 are significantly different from those of 
both the nutrient control (group 2) and the non-nutrient control (group 
1) for those days. No other significant differences are shown. 
Therefore, in terms of total aromatic degradation, the test indicates 
the desired statistically significant difference between the mean of the 
product and the mean of the non-nutrient control.

            6.0  Summary technical product test data format.

    The purpose of this format is to summarize in a standard and 
convenient presentation the technical product test data required by the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency before a product may be added to 
EPA's NCP Product Schedule, which may be used in carrying out the 
National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan. This 
format, however, is not to preclude the submission of all the laboratory 
data used to develop the data summarized in this format. Sufficient data 
should be presented on both the effectiveness and toxicity tests to 
enable EPA to evaluate the adequacy of the summarized data. A summary of 
the technical product test data should be submitted in the following 
format. The numbered headings should be used in all submissions. The 
subheadings indicate the kinds of information to be supplied. The listed 
subheadings, however, are not exhaustive; additional relevant 
information should be reported where necessary. As noted, some 
subheadings may apply only to particular types of agents.
    I. Name, Brand, or Trademark
    II. Name, Address, and Telephone Number of Manufacturer
    III. Name, Address, and Telephone Numbers of Primary Distributors
    IV. Special Handling and Worker Precautions for Storage and Field 
Application
    1. Flammability.
    2. Ventilation.
    3. Skin and eye contact; protective clothing; treatment in case of 
contact.
    4. Maximum and minimum storage temperatures; optimum storage 
temperature range; temperatures of phase separations and chemical 
changes.
    V. Shelf Life
    VI. Recommended Application Procedure
    1. Application method.
    2. Concentration, application rate (e.g., gallons of dispersant per 
ton of oil).
    3. Conditions for use: water salinity, water temperature, types and 
ages of pollutants.

    VIII.(a). Effectiveness (bioremediation agents). Raw data must be 
reported according to the format shown below. The first column lists the 
names of the analytes measured by GC/MS (SIM), the surrogate standards, 
and various ratios and sums. In the next three columns, the 
concentration of the analytes (ng/mg oil), the concentration of the 
analytes corrected for the recovery of the surrogate standard 
(<greek-a>-androstane for alkanes, d<INF>10-phenanthrene for aromatics), 
and the concentration of corrected analytes normalized against the 
conserved internal marker, respectively, are reported for the first 
replicate from the first sampling event. These three columns are each 
repeated for the next two replicates, giving 9 total columns for the 
product of interest. The next 9 columns are the same as the product 
columns except they are for the non-nutrient control. The last nine 
columns are for the nutrient control. Thus, a total of 28 columns are 
needed in the spreadsheet. This spreadsheet is for the first sampling 
event (day 0). Two more identical spreadsheets will be needed for each 
of the next two sampling events (days 7 and 28). For the statistical 
analysis, a report showing the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
table created by the software used by the investigator must be shown in 
its entirety along with the name of the software package used. Another 
printout showing the mean separation table (protected LSD test results) 
generated by the software must be reported. The statistical analyses are 
conducted using the sum of the alkane concentrations and the sum of the 
aromatics concentrations from the raw data table. Thus, two ANOVAs are 
run for each sampling event, one for total alkanes and one for total 
aromatics, giving a total of 6 ANOVAs for a product test (2 ANOVAs  x  3 
sampling events). Only if significant differences are detected by a 
given ANOVA will it be necessary to run a protected LSD test.

    1.0  Introduction.
    1.1  Background. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) amends the 
Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), commonly referred to as the 
Clean Water Act (CWA), to require the revision of the National Oil and 
Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP). In revising the 
NCP, the need to separate the response requirements for oil discharges 
and release of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants became 
evident.
    1.2  Purpose/objective. This document compiles general oil discharge 
response requirements into one appendix to aid participants and 
responders under the national response system (NRS). This appendix 
provides the organizational structure and procedures to prepare for and 
respond to oil discharges. Nothing in this appendix alters the meaning 
or policy stated in other sections or subparts of the NCP.
    1.3  Scope.
    (a) This appendix applies to discharges of oil into or upon the 
navigable waters of the United States and adjoining shorelines, the 
waters of the contiguous zone, or waters of the exclusive economic zone, 
or which may affect the natural resources belonging to, appertaining to, 
or under the exclusive management authority of the United States.
    (b) This appendix is designed to facilitate efficient, coordinated, 
and effective response to discharges of oil in accordance with the 
authorities of the CWA. It addresses:
    (1) The national response organization that may be activated in 
response actions, the responsibilities among the federal, state, and 
local governments, and the resources that are available for response.
    (2) The establishment of regional and area contingency plans.
    (3) Procedures for undertaking removal actions pursuant to section 
311 of the CWA.
    (4) Listing of federal trustees for natural resources for purposes 
of the CWA.
    (5) Procedures for the participation of other persons in response 
actions.
    (6) Procedures for compiling and making available cost documentation 
for response actions.
    (7) National procedures for the use of dispersants and other 
chemicals in removals under the CWA.
    (c) In implementing the NCP provisions compiled in this appendix, 
consideration shall be given to international assistance plans and 
agreements, security regulations and responsibilities based on 
international agreements, federal statutes, and executive orders. 
Actions taken pursuant to the provisions of any applicable international 
joint contingency plans shall be consistent with the NCP to the greatest 
extent possible. The Department of State shall be consulted, as 
appropriate, prior to taking action that may affect its activities.

to minimize or mitigate damage to the public health or welfare 
(including, but not limited to, fish, shellfish, wildlife, public and 
private property, and shorelines and beaches) or to the environment. For 
the purpose of the NCP, the term also includes monitoring of action to 
remove a discharge.
    Removal costs as defined by section 1001 of the OPA means the costs 
of removal that are incurred after a discharge of oil has occurred, or 
in any case in which there is a substantial threat of a discharge of oil

sink floating pollutants below the water surface.
    Size classes of discharges refers to the following size classes of 
oil discharges which are provided as guidance to the OSC and serve as 
the criteria for the actions delineated in subpart D. They are not meant 
to imply associated degrees of hazard to public health or welfare, nor 
are they a measure of environmental injury. Any oil discharge that poses 
a substantial threat to public health or welfare or the environment or 
results in significant public concern shall be classified as a major 
discharge regardless of the following quantitative measures:
    (a) Minor discharge means a discharge in inland waters of less than 
1,000 gallons of oil or a discharge to the coastal waters of less than 
10,000 gallons of oil.

hazardous substance penetrates the pores of the sorbent material, or a 
combination of the two. Sorbents are generally manufactured in 
particulate form for spreading over an oil slick or as sheets, rolls, 
pillows, or booms. The sorbent material may consist of, but is not 
limited to, the following materials:
    (a) Organic products--

where the USCG acts as predesignated on-scene coordinator. Precise 
locations are determined by EPA/USCG regional agreements and identified 
in federal regional contingency plans and area contingency plans.
    Spill of national significance (SONS) means a spill which due to its 
severity, size, location, actual or potential impact on the public 
health and welfare or the environment, or the necessary response effort,

state, local, and responsible party resources to contain and cleanup the 
discharge.
    State means the several states of the United States, the District of 
Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the 
U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, and any 
other territory or possession over which the United States has 
jurisdiction. For purposes of the NCP, the term includes Indian tribes 
as defined in the NCP except where specifically noted.
    Surface collecting agents means those chemical agents that form a 
surface film to control the layer thickness of oil.
    Surface washing agent is any product that removes oil from solid 
surfaces, such as beaches and rocks, through a detergency mechanism and 
does not involve dispersing or solubilizing the oil into the water 
column.

[[Page 275]]

    Tank vessel as defined by section 1001 of OPA means a vessel that is 
constructed or adapted to carry, or that carries, oil or hazardous 
material in bulk as cargo or cargo residue, and that: (1) is a vessel of 
the United States; (2) operates on the navigable waters; or (3) 
transfers oil or hazardous material in a place subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States.
    Threat of discharge, see definition for discharge.
    Trustee means an official of a federal natural resources management 
agency designated in subpart G of the NCP or a designated state official

section 1006 of the OPA.
    United States when used in relation to section 311(a)(5) of the CWA, 
mean the states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, and the Pacific Island Governments.
    Vessel as defined by section 311(a)(3) of the CWA means every 
description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or 
capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water other than 
a public vessel.
    Volunteer means any individual accepted to perform services by the 
lead agency which has authority to accept volunteer services (for 
examples, see 16 U.S.C. 742f(c)). A volunteer is subject to the 
provisions of the authorizing statute and the NCP.
    Worst case discharge as defined by section 311(a)(24) of the CWA 
means, in the case of a vessel, a discharge in adverse weather 
conditions of its entire cargo, and in the case of an offshore facility 
or onshore facility, the largest foreseeable discharge in adverse 
weather conditions.

                     2.0  National response system.

    2.1  Overview. The national response system (NRS) is the mechanism 
for coordinating response actions by all levels of government in support 
of the OSC. The NRS is composed of the National Response Team (NRT), 
Regional Response Teams (RRTs), On-scene coordinator (OSC), Area 
Committees, and Special Teams and related support entities. The NRS 
functions as an incident command system (ICS) under the direction of the 
OSC. Typical of an ICS, the NRS is capable of expanding or contracting 
to accommodate the response effort required by the size or complexity of 
the discharge.
    2.2  Priorities. (a) Safety of human life must be given the highest 
priority during every response action. This includes any search and 
rescue efforts in the general proximity of the discharge and the 
insurance of safety of response personnel.
    (b) Stabilizing the situation to preclude the event from worsening 
is the next priority. All efforts must be focused on saving a vessel 
that has been involved in a grounding, collision, fire or explosion, so 
that it does not compound the problem. Comparable measures should be 
taken to stabilize a situation involving a facility, pipeline, or other 
source of pollution. Stabilizing the situation includes securing the 
source of the spill and/or removing the remaining oil from the container 
(vessel, tank, or pipeline) to prevent additional oil spillage, to 
reduce the need for follow-up response action, and to minimize adverse 
impact to the environment.
    (c) The response must use all necessary containment and removal 
tactics in a coordinated manner to ensure a timely, effective response 
that minimizes adverse impact to the environment.
    (d) All parts of this national response strategy should be addressed 
concurrently, but safety and stabilization are the highest priorities. 
The OSC should not delay containment and removal decisions unnecessarily 
and should take actions to minimize adverse impact to the environment 
that begins as soon as a discharge occurs, as well as actions to 
minimize further adverse environmental impact from additional 
discharges.
    (e) The priorities set forth in this section are broad in nature, 
and should not be interpreted to preclude the consideration of other 
priorities that may arise on a site-specific basis.
    2.3  Responsibility. (a) The predesignated OSC has the 
responsibility to direct response actions and coordinate all other 
response efforts at the scene of an oil discharge or threatened 
discharge. The OSC monitors or directs all federal, state, local, and 
private removal actions, or arranges for the removal of an actual or 
threatened oil discharge, removing and if necessary, requesting 
authority to destroy a vessel. Additionally, the CWA requires the OSC to 
direct all federal, state, local, and private removal actions to any 
incident that poses a substantial threat to the public health or 
welfare.
    (b) Cleanup responsibility for an oil discharge immediately falls on 
the responsible party, unless the discharge poses a substantial threat 
to public health or welfare. In a large percentage of oil discharges, 
the responsible party shall conduct the cleanup. If the responsible 
party does conduct the removal, the OSC shall ensure adequate 
surveillance over whatever actions are initiated.
    (1) If effective actions are not being taken to eliminate the 
threat, or if removal is not being properly done, the OSC should, to the 
extent practicable under the circumstances, so advise the responsible 
party. If the responsible party does not respond properly, the OSC shall 
take appropriate response actions and should notify the responsible 
party of the potential liability for federal response costs incurred by 
the OSC pursuant to the

[[Page 276]]

OPA and CWA. Where practicable, continuing efforts should be made to 
encourage response by responsible parties.
    (2) If the Administrator of EPA or the Secretary of the department 
in which the USCG is operating determines that there may be an imminent 
and substantial threat to the public health or welfare or the 
environment of the United States (including fish, shellfish, and 
wildlife, public and private property, shorelines, beaches, habitats, 
and other living and nonliving natural resources under the jurisdiction 
or control of the United States, because of an actual or threatened 
discharge of oil from any vessel or offshore or onshore facility into or 
upon the navigable waters of the United States), the Administrator or 
Secretary may request the U.S. Attorney General to secure the relief 
from any person, including the owner or operator of the vessel or 
facility necessary to abate a threat or, after notice to the affected 
state, take any other action authorized by section 311 of the CWA 
including administrative orders, that may be necessary to protect the 
public health or welfare.
    (3) The responsible party is liable for costs of federal removal and 
damages in accordance with section 311(f) of the CWA, section 1002 of 
the OPA, and other federal laws.
    (c) In those incidents where a discharge or threat of discharge 
poses a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United 
States, the OSC shall direct all federal, state, or private actions to 
remove the discharge or to mitigate or prevent the threat of such a 
discharge, as appropriate. The OSC shall also request immediate 
activation of the RRT.
    (d) During responses to any discharge the OSC may request advice or 
support from the Special Teams and any local support units identified by 
the Area Committee. Examples include scientific advice from the 
Scientific Support Coordinator (SSC), technical guidance or 
prepositioned equipment from the District Response Group (DRG), or 
public information assistance from the National Strike Force (NSF).
    (e) When an oil discharge exceeds the response capability of the 
region in which it occurs, transects regional boundaries, or involves a 
substantial threat to the public health or welfare, substantial amounts 
of property, or substantial threats to the natural resources, the NRT 
should be activated as an emergency response team. If appropriate the 
RRT Chairman may contact the NRT Chairman and request the NRT 
activation.

    3.0  Components of national response system and responsibilities.

    The NRS is the mechanism for coordinating response actions by all 
levels of government in support of the OSC. The NRS organization is 
divided into national, regional, and area levels. The national level 
comprises the NRT, the National Strike Force Coordination Center 
(NSFCC), and the National Response Center (NRC). The regional level is 
comprised of the RRT. The area level is made up of the OSC, Special 
Teams, and Area Committees. The basic framework for the response 
management structure is a system (e.g., a unified command system), that 
brings together the functions of the federal government, the state 
government, and the responsible party to achieve an effective and 
efficient response, where the OSC retains authority.

                             3.1  National.

    3.1.1 National response team. (a) National planning and coordination 
is accomplished through the NRT. The NRT consists of representatives 
from the USCG, EPA, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), 
Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Energy (DOE), Department of 
Agriculture (DOA), Department of Commerce (DOC), Department of Health 
and Human Services (HHS), Department of the Interior (DOI), Department 
of Justice (DOJ), Department of Labor (DOL), Department of 
Transportation (DOT), Department of State (DOS), Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, and General Services Administration (GSA). Each agency shall 
designate a member to the team and sufficient alternates to ensure 
representation, as agency resources permit. The NRT will consider 
requests for membership on the NRT from other agencies. Other agencies 
may request membership by forwarding such requests to the chair of the 
NRT (see Figure 1).
    (b) The chair of the NRT shall be the representative of the EPA and 
the vice chair shall be the representative of the USCG, with the 
exception of periods of activation because of response action. During 
activation, the chair shall be the member agency providing the OSC. The 
vice chair shall maintain records of NRT activities along with national, 
regional, and area plans for response actions.
    (c) While the NRT desires to achieve a consensus on all matters 
brought before it, certain matters may prove unresolvable by this means. 
In such cases, each agency serving as a participating agency on the NRT 
may be accorded one vote in NRT proceedings.
    (d) The NRT may establish such bylaws, procedures, and committees as 
it deems appropriate to further the purposes for which it is 
established.
    (e) The NRT shall evaluate methods of responding to discharges, 
shall recommend any changes needed in the response organization, and 
shall recommend to the Administrator of EPA changes to the NCP designed 
to improve the effectiveness of the national response system, including 
drafting of regulatory language.

[[Page 277]]

    (f) The NRT shall provide policy and program direction to the RRTs.
    (g) The NRT may consider and make recommendations to appropriate 
agencies on the training, equipping, and protection of response teams 
and necessary research, development, demonstration, and evaluation to 
improve response capabilities.

[[Page 279]]

    (h) Direct planning and preparedness responsibilities of the NRT 
include:
    (1) Maintaining national preparedness to respond to a major 
discharge of oil that is beyond regional capabilities;
    (2) Monitoring incoming reports from all RRTs and activating for a 
response action, when necessary;
    (3) Coordinating a national program to assist member agencies in 
preparedness planning and response, and enhancing coordination of member 
agency preparedness programs;
    (4) Developing procedures, in coordination with the NSFCC, as 
appropriate, to ensure the coordination of federal, state, and local 
governments, and private response to oil discharges;
    (5) Monitoring response-related research and development, testing, 
and evaluation activities of NRT agencies to enhance coordination, avoid 
duplication of effort, and facilitate research in support of response 
activities;
    (6) Developing recommendations for response training and for 
enhancing the coordination of available resources among agencies with 
training responsibilities under the NCP;
    (7) Reviewing regional responses to oil discharges, including an 
evaluation of equipment readiness and coordination among responsible 
public agencies and private organizations; and
    (8) Assisting in developing a national exercise program, in 
coordination with the NSFCC to ensure preparedness and coordination 
nationwide.
    (i) The NRT shall consider matters referred to it for advice or 
resolution by an RRT.
    (j) The NRT should be activated as an emergency response team:
    (1) When an oil discharge:
    (A) Exceeds the response capability of the region in which it 
occurs;
    (B) Transects regional boundaries; or
    (C) Involves a substantial threat to the public health or welfare, 
substantial amounts of property, or substantial threats to natural 
resources;
    (2) If requested by any NRT member.
    (k) When activated for a response action, the NRT will meet at the 
call of the chair and may:
    (1) Monitor and evaluate reports from the OSC and recommend to the 
OSC, through the RRT, actions to combat the discharge;
    (2) Request other federal, state and local governments, or private 
agencies, to provide resources under their existing authorities to 
combat a discharge, or to monitor response operations; and
    (3) Coordinate the supply of equipment, personnel, or technical 
advice to the affected region from other regions or districts.
    3.1.2  National response center. (a) The NRC, located at USCG 
Headquarters, is the national communications center, continuously manned 
for handling activities related to response actions, including those 
involving discharges of oil. The NRC acts as the single point of contact 
for all pollution incident reporting, and as the NRT communications 
center. Notice of discharges must be made by telephone through a toll 
free number or a special number (Telecommunication Device for the Deaf 
(TDD) and collect calls accepted). Upon receipt of a notification of 
discharge, the NRC shall promptly notify the OSC. The telephone report 
is distributed to any interested NRT member agency or federal entity 
that has established a written agreement or understanding with the NRC.
    (b) The Commandant, USCG, in conjunction with other NRT agencies, 
provides the necessary personnel, communications, plotting facilities, 
and equipment for the NRC.
    (c) Notice of an oil discharge in an amount equal to or greater than 
the reportable quantity must be made immediately in accordance with 33 
CFR part 153, subpart B. Notification will be made to the NRC Duty 
Officer, HQ USCG, Washington, DC, telephone (800) 424-8802 or (202) 267-
2675. All notices of discharges received at the NRC will be relayed 
immediately by telephone to the OSC.
    3.1.3  National strike force coordination center. NSFCC, located in 
Elizabeth City, North Carolina, may assist the OSC by providing 
information on available spill removal resources, personnel, and 
equipment. The NSFCC can provide the following support to the OSC:
    (a) Technical assistance, equipment, and other resources to augment 
the OSC staff during spill response;
    (b) Assistance in coordinating the use of private and public 
resources in support of the OSC during a response to or a threat of a 
worst case discharge of oil;
    (c) Review of the area contingency plan, including an evaluation of 
equipment readiness and coordination among responsible public agencies 
and private organizations;
    (d) Assistance in locating spill response resources for both 
response and planning, using the NSFCC's national and international 
computerized inventory of spill response resources;
    (e) Coordination and evaluation of pollution response exercises; and
    (f) Inspection of district prepositioned pollution response 
equipment.
    3.2  Regional. (a) Regional planning and coordination of 
preparedness and response actions is accomplished through the RRT. In 
the case of a discharge of oil, preparedness activities shall be carried 
out in conjunction with Area Committees as appropriate. The RRT agency 
membership parallels that of the NRT, but also includes state and local

[[Page 280]]

representation. The RRT provides: (1) the appropriate regional mechanism 
for development and coordination of preparedness activities before a 
response action is taken and for coordination of assistance and advice 
to the OSC during such response actions; and (2) guidance to Area 
Committees, as appropriate, to ensure inter-area consistency and 
consistency of individual ACPs with the RCP and NCP.
    (b) The two principal components of the RRT mechanism are a standing 
team, which consists of designated representatives from each 
participating federal agency, state governments, and local governments 
(as agreed upon by the states); and incident-specific teams formed from 
the standing team when the RRT is activated for a response. On incident-
specific teams, participation by the RRT member agencies will relate to 
the technical nature of the incident and its geographic location.
    (1) The standing team's jurisdiction corresponds to the standard 
federal regions, except for Alaska, Oceania in the Pacific, and the 
Caribbean area, each of which has a separate standing RRT. The role of 
the standing RRT includes communications systems and procedures, 
planning, coordination, training, evaluation, preparedness, and related 
matters on a regionwide basis. It also includes coordination of Area 
Committees for these functions in areas within their respective regions, 
as appropriate.
    (2) The role of the incident-specific team is determined by the 
operational requirements of the response to a specific discharge. 
Appropriate levels of activation and/or notification of the incident-
specific RRT, including participation by state and local governments, 
shall be determined by the designated RRT chair for the incident, based 
on the RCP. The incident-specific RRT supports the designated OSC. The 
designated OSC manages response efforts and coordinates all other 
efforts at the scene of a discharge.
    (c) The representatives of EPA and the USCG shall act as co-chairs 
of the RRTs except when the RRT is activated. When the RRT is activated 
for response actions, the chair is the member agency providing the OSC.
    (d) Each participating agency should designate one member and at 
least one alternate member to the RRT. Agencies whose regional 
subdivisions do not correspond to the standard federal regions may 
designate additional representatives to the standing RRT to ensure 
appropriate coverage of the standard federal region. Participating 
states may also designate one member and at least one alternate member 
to the RRT. Indian tribal governments may arrange with the RRT for 
representation appropriate to their geographical location. All agencies 
and states may also provide additional representatives as observers to 
meetings of the RRT.
    (e) RRT members should designate representatives and alternates from 
their agencies as resource personnel for RRT activities, including RRT 
work planning, and membership on incident-specific teams in support of 
the OSCs.
    (f) Federal RRT members or their representatives should provide OSCs 
with assistance from their respective federal agencies commensurate with 
agency responsibilities, resources, and capabilities within the region. 
During a response action, the members of the RRT should seek to make 
available the resources of their agencies to the OSC as specified in the 
RCP and ACP.
    (g) RRT members should nominate appropriately qualified 
representatives from their agencies to work with OSCs in developing and 
maintaining ACPs.
    (h) Affected states are encouraged to participate actively in all 
RRT activities. Each state Governor is requested to assign an office or 
agency to represent the state on the appropriate RRT; to designate 
representatives to work with the RRT in developing RCPs; to plan for, 
make available, and coordinate state resources for use in response 
actions; and to serve as the contact point for coordination of response 
with local government agencies, whether or not represented on the RRT. 
The state's RRT representative should keep the State Emergency Response 
Commission (SERC) apprised of RRT activities and coordinate RRT 
activities with the SERC. Local governments are invited to participate 
in activities on the appropriate RRT as provided by state law or as 
arranged by the state's representative. Indian tribes are also invited 
to participate in such activities.
    (i) The standing RRT shall recommend changes in the regional 
response organization as needed, revise the RCP as needed, evaluate the 
preparedness of the participating agencies and the effectiveness of ACPs 
for the federal response to discharges, and provide technical assistance 
for preparedness to the response community. The RRT should:
    (1) Review and comment, to the extent practicable, on local 
emergency response plans or other issues related to the preparation, 
implementation, or exercise of such plans upon request of a local 
emergency planning committee;
    (2) Evaluate regional and local responses to discharges on a 
continuing basis, considering available legal remedies, equipment 
readiness, and coordination among responsible public agencies and 
private organizations, and recommend improvements;
    (3) Recommend revisions of the NCP to the NRT, based on observations 
of response operations;
    (4) Review OSC actions to ensure that RCPs and ACPs are effective;

[[Page 281]]

    (5) Encourage the state and local response community to improve its 
preparedness for response;
    (6) In coordination with the Area Committee and in accordance with 
any applicable laws, regulations, or requirements, conduct advance 
planning for use of dispersants, surface washing agents, surface 
collecting agents, burning agents, bioremediation agents, or other 
chemical agents in accordance with subpart J of this part;
    (7) Be prepared to provide response resources to major discharges or 
releases outside the region;
    (8) Conduct or participate in training and exercises as necessary to 
encourage preparedness activities of the response community within the 
region;
    (9) Meet at least semiannually to review response actions carried 
out during the preceding period, consider changes in RCPs, and recommend 
changes in ACPs;
    (10) Provide letter reports on RRT activities to the NRT twice a 
year, no later than January 31 and July 31; and
    (11) Ensure maximum participation in the national exercise program 
for announced and unannounced exercises.
    (j)(1) The RRT may be activated by the chair as an incident-specific 
response team when a discharge:
    (A) Exceeds the response capability available to the OSC in the 
place where it occurs;
    (B) Transects state boundaries;
    (C) May pose a substantial threat to the public health or welfare, 
or to regionally significant amounts of property; or
    (D) Is a worst case discharge, as defined in section 1.5 of this 
appendix.
    (2) The RRT shall be activated during any discharge upon a request 
from the OSC, or from any RRT representative, to the chair of the RRT. 
Requests for RRT activation shall later be confirmed in writing. Each 
representative, or an appropriate alternate, should be notified 
immediately when the RRT is activated.
    (3) During prolonged removal or remedial action, the RRT may not 
need to be activated or may need to be activated only in a limited 
sense, or may need to have available only those member agencies of the 
RRT who are directly affected or who can provide direct response 
assistance.
    (4) When the RRT is activated for a discharge or release, agency 
representatives will meet at the call of the chair and may:
    (A) Monitor and evaluate reports from the OSC, advise the OSC on the 
duration and extent of response, and recommend to the OSC specific 
actions to respond to the discharge;
    (B) Request other federal, state, or local governments, or private 
agencies, to provide resources under their existing authorities to 
respond to a discharge or to monitor response operations;
    (C) Help the OSC prepare information releases for the public and for 
communication with the NRT;
    (D) If the circumstances warrant, make recommendations to the 
regional or district head of the agency providing the OSC that a 
different OSC should be designated; and
    (E) Submit pollution reports to the NRC as significant developments 
occur.
    (5) RCPs shall specify detailed criteria for activation of RRTs.
    (6) At the regional level, a Regional Response Center (RRC) may 
provide facilities and personnel for communications, information 
storage, and other requirements for coordinating response. The location 
of each RRC should be provided in the RCP.
    (7) When the RRT is activated, affected states may participate in 
all RRT deliberations. State government representatives participating in 
the RRT have the same status as any federal member of the RRT.
    (8) The RRT can be deactivated when the incident-specific RRT chair 
determines that the OSC no longer requires RRT assistance.
    (9) Notification of the RRT may be appropriate when full activation 
is not necessary, with systematic communication of pollution reports or 
other means to keep RRT members informed as to actions of potential 
concern to a particular agency, or to assist in later RRT evaluation of 
regionwide response effectiveness.
    (k) Whenever there is insufficient national policy guidance on a 
matter before the RRT, a technical matter requiring solution, a question 
concerning interpretation of the NCP, or a disagreement on discretionary 
actions among RRT members that cannot be resolved at the regional level, 
it may be referred to the NRT for advice.
    3.3  Area.
    3.3.1  On-scene coordinator. The OSC is the federal official 
predesignated by EPA or the USCG to coordinate and direct federal 
responses under subpart D of the NCP. The USCG shall provide OSCs for 
oil discharges, including discharges from facilities and vessels under 
the jurisdiction of another federal agency, within or threatening the 
coastal zone. EPA shall provide OSCs for discharges into or threatening 
the inland zone. In carrying out a response, the OSC may direct or 
monitor all federal, state, and private actions to remove a discharge. 
In contingency planning and removal, the OSC coordinates, directs, and 
reviews the work of other agencies, Area Committees, responsible 
parties, and contractors to assure compliance with the NCP, decision 
document, consent decree, administrative order, and lead agency-approved 
plans applicable to the response.
    3.3.2  Area committees. (a) Area Committees shall be responsible 
for: (1) preparing an ACP for their areas; (2) working with appropriate 
federal, state, and local officials to enhance the contingency planning 
of those officials

[[Page 282]]

and to assure pre-planning of joint response efforts, including 
appropriate procedures for mechanical recovery, dispersal, shoreline 
cleanup, protection of sensitive environmental areas, and protection, 
rescue, and rehabilitation of fisheries and wildlife; and (3) working 
with appropriate federal, state, and local officials to expedite 
decisions for the use of dispersants and other mitigating substances and 
devices.
    (b) The OSC is responsible for overseeing development of the ACP in 
the area of the OSC's responsibility. The ACP, when implemented in 
conjunction with other provisions of the NCP, shall be adequate to 
remove a worst case discharge, and to mitigate and prevent a substantial 
threat of such a discharge, from a vessel, offshore facility, or onshore 
facility operating in or near the area.
    3.3.3  Special teams. (a) Special teams include: NOAA/EPA's SSCs; 
EPA's Environmental Response Team (ERT); and USCG's NSF; DRGs; and NPFC 
(see Figure 2).
    (b) SSCs may be designated by the OSC as the principal advisors for 
scientific issues, communication with the scientific community, and 
coordination of requests for assistance from state and federal agencies 
regarding scientific studies. The SSC strives for a consensus on 
scientific issues affecting the response, but ensures that differing 
opinions within the community are communicated to the OSC.
    (1) Generally, SSCs are provided by NOAA in the coastal zones, and 
by EPA in the inland zone. OSC requests for SSC support may be made 
directly to the SSC assigned to the area or to the agency member of the 
RRT. NOAA SSCs may also be requested through NOAA's SSC program office 
in Seattle, WA. NOAA SSCs are assigned to USCG Districts and are 
supported by a scientific support team that includes expertise in 
environmental chemistry, oil slick tracking, pollutant transport 
modeling, natural resources at risk, environmental tradeoffs of 
countermeasures and cleanup, and information management.

[[Page 284]]

    (2) During a response, the SSC serves on the federal OSC's staff and 
may, at the request of the OSC, lead the scientific team and be 
responsible for providing scientific support for operational decisions 
and for coordinating on-scene scientific activity. Depending on the 
nature and location of the incident, the SSC integrates expertise from 
governmental agencies, universities, community representatives, and 
industry to assist the OSC in evaluating the hazards and potential 
effects of releases and in developing response strategies.
    (3) At the request of the OSC, the SSC may facilitate the OSC's work 
with the lead administrative trustee for natural resources to ensure 
coordination between damage assessment data collection efforts and data 
collected in support of response operations.
    (4) SSCs support the RRTs and the Area Committees in preparing 
regional and area contingency plans and in conducting spill training and 
exercises. For area plans, the SSC provides leadership for the synthesis 
and integration of environmental information required for spill response 
decisions in support of the OSC.
    (c)(1) SUPSALV has an extensive salvage/search and recovery 
equipment inventory with the requisite knowledge and expertise to 
support these operations, including specialized salvage, firefighting, 
and petroleum, oil and lubricants offloading capability.
    (2) When possible, SUPSALV will provide equipment for training 
exercises in support of national and regional contingency planning 
objectives.
    (3) The OSC/RPM may request assistance directly from SUPSALV. Formal 
requests are routed through the Chief of Naval Operations (N312).
    (d) The ERT is established by the EPA in accordance with its 
disaster and emergency responsibilities. The ERT has expertise in 
treatment technology, biology, chemistry, hydrology, geology and 
engineering.
    (1) The ERT can provide access to special decontamination equipment 
and advice to the OSC in hazard evaluation; risk assessment; multimedia 
sampling and analysis program; on-site safety, including development and 
implementation plans; cleanup techniques and priorities; water supply 
decontamination and protection; application of dispersants; 
environmental assessment; degree of cleanup required; and disposal of 
contaminated material. The ERT also provides both introductory and 
intermediate level training courses to prepare response personnel.
    (2) OSC or RRT requests for ERT support should be made to the EPA 
representative on the RRT; EPA Headquarters, Director, Emergency 
Response Division; or the appropriate EPA regional emergency 
coordinator.
    (e) The NSF is a special team established by the USCG, including the 
three USCG Strike Teams, the Public Information Assist Team (PIAT), and 
the NSFCC. The NSF is available to assist OSCs in their preparedness and 
response duties.
    (1) The three Strike Teams (Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific) provide 
trained personnel and specialized equipment to assist the OSC in 
training for spill response, stabilizing and containing the spill, and 
in monitoring or directing the response actions of the responsible 
parties and/or contractors. The OSC has a specific team designated for 
initial contact and may contact that team directly for any assistance.
    (2) The NSFCC can provide the following support to the OSC:
    --Technical assistance, equipment and other resources to augment the 
OSC staff during spill response;
    --Assistance in coordinating the use of private and public resources 
in support of the OSC during a response to or a threat of a worst case 
discharge of oil;
    --Review of the ACP, including an evaluation of equipment readiness 
and coordination among responsible public agencies and private 
organizations;
    --Assistance in locating spill response resources for both response 
and planning, using the NSFCC's national and international computerized 
inventory of spill response resources;
    --Coordination and evaluation of pollution response exercises; and
    --Inspection of district prepositioned pollution response equipment.
    (3) PIAT is an element of the NSFCC staff which is available to 
assist OSCs to meet the demands for public information during a response 
or exercise. Its use is encouraged any time the OSC requires outside 
public affairs support. Requests for PIAT assistance may be made through 
the NSFCC or NRC.
    (f)(1) The DRG assists the OSC by providing technical assistance, 
personnel, and equipment, including pre-positioned equipment. Each DRG 
consists of all Coast Guard personnel and equipment, including marine 
firefighting equipment, in its district, additional pre-positioned 
equipment, and a District Response Advisory Team (DRAT) that is 
available to provide support to the OSC in the event that a spill 
exceeds local response capabilities. Each DRG:
    (A) Shall provide technical assistance, equipment, and other 
resources as available when requested by an OSC through the USCG 
representative to the RRT;
    (B) Shall ensure maintenance of all USCG response equipment within 
its district;
    (C) May provide technical assistance in the preparation of the ACP; 
and
    (D) Shall review each of those plans that affect its area of 
geographic responsibility.
    (2) In deciding where to locate personnel and pre-positioned 
equipment, the USCG shall give priority emphasis to:

[[Page 285]]

    (A) The availability of facilities for loading and unloading heavy 
or bulky equipment by barge;
    (B) The proximity to an airport capable of supporting large military 
transport aircraft;
    (C) The flight time to provide response to oil spills in all areas 
of the Coast Guard district with the potential for marine casualties;
    (D) The availability of trained local personnel capable of 
responding in an oil spill emergency; and
    (E) Areas where large quantities of petroleum products are 
transported.
    (g) The NPFC is responsible for implementing those portions of Title 
I of the OPA that have been delegated to the Secretary of the department 
in which the Coast Guard is operating. The NPFC is responsible for 
addressing funding issues arising from discharges and threats of 
discharges of oil. The NPFC:
    (1) Issues Certificates of Financial Responsibility to owners and 
operators of vessels to pay for costs and damages that are incurred by 
their vessels as a result of oil discharges; (2) Provides funding for 
various response organizations for timely abatement and removal actions 
related to oil discharges;
    (3) Provides equitable compensation to claimants who sustain costs 
and damages from oil discharges when the responsible party fails to do 
so;
    (4) Recovers monies from persons liable for costs and damages 
resulting from oil discharges to the full extent of liability under the 
law; and
    (5) Provides funds to initiate natural resources damage assessment.
    (h) The organizational concepts of the national response system 
discussed above are depicted in Figure 3.

                      4.0  Preparedness activities.

    4.1  Federal contingency plans. This section summarizes emergency 
preparedness activities relating to discharges of oil and describes the 
three levels of contingency planning under the national response system.
    4.1.1  National contingency plan. (a) The NCP provides for 
efficient, coordinated, and effective response to discharges of oil in 
accordance with the authorities of the CWA. It provides for:
    (1) The national response organization that may be activated in 
response actions and specifies responsibilities among the federal, 
state, and local governments and describes resources that are available 
for response;
    (2) The establishment of requirements for federal, regional, and 
area contingency plans;
    (3) Procedures for undertaking removal actions pursuant to section 
311 of the CWA;

[[Page 286]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC02AU92.020



[[Page 287]]

    (4) Procedures for involving state governments in the initiation, 
development, selection, and implementation of response actions;
    (5) Listing of federal trustees for natural resources for purposes 
of the CWA;
    (6) Procedures for the participation of other persons in response 
actions; and
    (7) National procedures for the use of dispersants and other 
chemicals in removals under the CWA.
    (b) In implementing the NCP, consideration shall be given to 
international assistance plans and agreements, security regulations and 
responsibilities based on international agreements, federal statutes, 
and executive orders. Actions taken pursuant to the provisions of any 
applicable international joint contingency plans shall be consistent 
with the NCP, to the greatest extent possible. The Department of State 
shall be consulted, as appropriate, prior to taking action which may 
affect its activities.
    4.1.2  Regional contingency plans. The RRTs, working with the 
states, shall develop federal RCPs for each standard federal region, 
Alaska, Oceania in the Pacific, and the Caribbean to coordinate timely, 
effective response by various federal agencies and other organizations 
to discharges of oil. RCPs shall, as appropriate, include information on 
all useful facilities and resources in the region, from government, 
commercial, academic, and other sources. To the greatest extent 
possible, RCPs shall follow the format of the NCP and be coordinated 
with state emergency response plans, ACPs, and Title III local emergency 
response plans. Such coordination should be accomplished by working with 
the SERCs in the region covered by the RCP. RCPs shall contain lines of 
demarcation between the inland and coastal zones, as mutually agreed 
upon by the USCG and the EPA.
    4.1.3  Area contingency plans. (a) Under the direction of an OSC and 
subject to approval by the lead agency, each Area Committee, in 
consultation with the appropriate RRTs, DRGs, the NSFCC, SSCs, Local 
Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs), and SERCs, shall develop an ACP 
for its designated area. This plan, when implemented in conjunction with 
other provisions of the NCP, shall be adequate to remove a worst case 
discharge, and to mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of such a 
discharge, from a vessel, offshore facility, or onshore facility 
operating in or near the area.
    (b) The areas of responsibility may include several Title III local 
planning districts, or parts of such districts. In developing the ACP, 
the OSC shall coordinate with affected SERCs and LEPCs. The ACP shall 
provide for a well coordinated response that is integrated and 
compatible to the greatest extent possible with all appropriate response 
plans of state, local, and non-federal entities, and especially with 
Title III local emergency response plans.
    (c) The ACP shall include the following:
    (1) A description of the area covered by the plan, including the 
areas of special economic or environmental importance that might be 
impacted by a discharge;
    (2) A description in detail of the responsibilities of an owner or 
operator and of federal, state, and local agencies in removing a 
discharge, and in mitigating or preventing a substantial threat of a 
discharge;
    (3) A list of equipment (including firefighting equipment), 
dispersants, or other mitigating substances and devices, and personnel 
available to an owner or operator and federal, state, and local 
agencies, to ensure an effective and immediate removal of a discharge, 
and to ensure mitigation or prevention of a substantial threat of a 
discharge (this may be provided in an appendix or by reference to other 
relevant emergency plans (e.g., state or LEPC plans), which may include 
such equipment lists);
    (4) A description of procedures to be followed for obtaining an 
expedited decision regarding the use of dispersants; and
    (5) A detailed description of how the plan is integrated into other 
ACPs and tank vessel, offshore facility, and onshore facility response 
plans approved by the President, and into operating procedures of the 
NSFCC.
    4.1.4  Fish and Wildlife and sensitive environments plan annex. (a) 
In order to provide for coordinated, immediate and effective protection, 
rescue, and rehabilitation of, and minimization of risk of injury to, 
fish and wildlife resources and habitat, Area Committees shall 
incorporate into each ACP a detailed annex containing a Fish and 
Wildlife and Sensitive Environments Plan that is consistent with the RCP 
and NCP. The annex shall be prepared in consultation with the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service (FWS) and NOAA and other interested natural 
resource management agencies and parties. It shall address fish and 
wildlife resources and their habitat, and shall include other areas 
considered sensitive environments in a separate section of the annex, 
based upon Area Committee recommendations. The annex shall provide the 
necessary information and procedures to immediately and effectively 
respond to discharges that may adversely affect fish and wildlife and 
their habitat and sensitive environments, including provisions for a 
response to a worst case discharge. Such information shall include the 
identification of appropriate agencies and their responsibilities, 
procedures to notify these agencies following a discharge or threat of a 
discharge; protocols for obtaining required fish and wildlife permits 
and other necessary permits, and provisions to ensure compatibility of 
annex-related activities with removal operations.
    (b) The annex shall:

[[Page 288]]

    (1) Identify and establish priorities for fish and wildlife 
resources and their habitats and other important sensitive areas 
requiring protection from any direct or indirect effects from discharges 
that may occur. These effects include, but are not limited to, any 
seasonal or historical use, as well as all critical, special, 
significant or otherwise designated protected areas.
    (2) Provide a mechanism to be used during a spill response for 
timely identification of protection priorities of those fish and 
wildlife resources and habitats and sensitive environmental areas that 
may be threatened or injured by a discharge. These include as 
appropriate, not only marine and freshwater species, habitats, and their 
food sources, but also terrestrial wildlife and their habitats that may 
be affected directly by onshore oil or indirectly by oil-related 
factors, such as loss or contamination of forage. The mechanism shall 
also provide for expeditious evaluation and appropriate consultations on 
the effects to fish and wildlife, their habitat, and other sensitive 
environments from the application of chemical countermeasures or other 
countermeasures not addressed under paragraph (3) of this section.
    (3) Identify potential environmental effects on fish and wildlife, 
their habitat, and other sensitive environments resulting from removal 
actions or countermeasures, including the option of no removal. Based on 
this evaluation of potential environmental effects, the annex should 
establish priorities for application of countermeasure and removal 
actions to habitats within the geographic region of the ACP. The annex 
should establish methods to minimize the identified effects on fish and 
wildlife because of response activities, including, but not limited to, 
disturbance of sensitive areas and habitats; illegal or inadvertent 
taking or disturbance of fish and wildlife or specimens by response 
personnel; and fish and wildlife, their habitat, and environmentally 
sensitive areas coming in contact with various cleaning or 
bioremediation agents. Furthermore, the annex should identify the areas 
where the movement of oiled debris may pose a risk to resident, 
transient, or migratory fish and wildlife, and other sensitive 
environments and should discuss measures to be considered for removing 
such oiled debris in a timely fashion to reduce such risk.
    (4) Provide for pre-approval of application of specific 
countermeasures or removal actions that, if expeditiously applied, will 
minimize adverse spill-induced impacts to fish and wildlife resources, 
their habitat, and other sensitive environments. Such pre-approval plans 
must be consistent with paragraphs (2) and (3) of this section and 
subpart J requirements of the NCP, and must have the concurrence of the 
natural resource trustees.
    (5) Provide monitoring plan(s) to evaluate the effectiveness of 
different countermeasures or removal actions in protecting the 
environment. Monitoring should include ``set-aside'' or ``control'' 
areas, where no mitigative actions are taken.
    (6) Identify and plan for the acquisition and utilization of 
necessary response capabilities for protection, rescue, and 
rehabilitation of fish and wildlife resources and habitat. This may 
include appropriately permitted private organizations and individuals 
with appropriate expertise and experience. The suitable organizations 
should be identified in cooperation with natural resource law 
enforcement agencies. Such capabilities shall include, but not be 
limited to, identification of facilities and equipment necessary for 
deterring sensitive fish and wildlife from entering oiled areas, and for 
capturing, holding, cleaning, and releasing injured wildlife. Plans for 
the provision of such capabilities shall ensure that there is no 
interference with other OSC removal operations.
    (7) Identify appropriate federal and state agency contacts and 
alternates responsible for coordination of fish and wildlife rescue and 
rehabilitation and protection of sensitive environments; identify and 
provide for required fish and wildlife handling and rehabilitation 
permits necessary under federal and state laws; and provide guidance on 
the implementation of law enforcement requirements included under 
current federal and state laws and corresponding regulations. 
Requirements include, but are not limited to procedures regarding the 
capture, transport, rehabilitation, release of wildlife exposed to or 
threatened by oil, and disposal of contaminated carcasses of wildlife.
    (8) Identify and secure the means for providing, if needed, the 
minimum required Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
training for volunteers, including those who assist with injured 
wildlife.
    (9) Evaluate the compatibility between this annex and non-federal 
response plans (including those of vessels, facilities and pipelines) on 
issues affecting fish and wildlife, their habitat, and sensitive 
environments.

               4.2  OPA facility and vessel response plans

    This section describes and cross-references the regulations that 
implement section 311(j)(5) of the CWA. A tank vessel, as defined under 
section 2101 of title 46, U.S. Code, an offshore facility, and an 
onshore facility that, because of its location, could reasonably expect 
to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging into or on 
the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or exclusive economic zone 
must prepare and submit a plan for responding, to the maximum extent 
practicable, to a worst case discharge,

[[Page 289]]

and to a substantial threat of such a discharge, of oil or a hazardous 
substance. These response plans are required to be consistent with 
applicable Area Contingency Plans. These regulations are codified as 
follows:
    (a) For tank vessels, these regulations are codified in 33 CFR part 
155;
    (b) For offshore facilities, these regulations are codified in 30 
CFR part 254;
    (c) For non-transportation related onshore facilities, these 
regulations are codified in 40 CFR part 112.20;
    (d) For transportation-related onshore facilities, these regulations 
are cofidied in 33 CFR part 154;
    (e) For pipeline facilities, these regulations are codified in 49 
CFR part 194; and
    (f) For rolling stock, these regulations are codified in 49 CFR part 
106 et al.

                     4.3  Relation to others plans.

    4.3.1  Federal response plans. In the event of a declaration of a 
major disaster by the President, the FEMA may activate the Federal 
Response Plan (FRP). A Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO), designated by 
the President, may implement the FRP and coordinate and direct emergency 
assistance and disaster relief of impacted individuals, business, and 
public services under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act. 
Delivery of federal assistance is facilitated through twelve functional 
annexes to the FRP known as Emergency Support Functions (ESFs). EPA 
coordinates activities under ESF #10--Hazardous Materials, which 
addresses preparedness and response to hazardous materials and oil 
incidents caused by a natural disaster or other catastrophic event. In 
such cases, the OSC should coordinate response activities with the FCO, 
through the incident-specific ESF #10 Chair, to ensure consistency with 
federal disaster assistance activities.
    4.3.2  Tank Vessel and Facility Response Plans. (a) Under CWA 
section 311(j)(5), tank vessels, offshore facilities, and certain 
onshore facilities are required to prepare and submit response plans for 
review and approval by the President for the carriage, storage, and 
transportation of oil and hazardous substances. Separate regulations 
published by the appropriate federal agencies provide for required 
response plan development and/or approval.
    (b) These plans shall be developed to coordinate responsible party 
actions with the OSC and the ACP response strategies, for response to 
oil discharges within the inland and coastal zones of the United States.

                      4.4  Pre-approval authority.

    (a) RRTs and Area Committees shall address, as part of their 
planning activities, the desirability of using appropriate dispersants, 
surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, bioremediation 
agents, or miscellaneous oil spill control agents listed on the NCP 
Product Schedule, and the desirability of using appropriate burning 
agents. RCPs and ACPs shall, as appropriate, include applicable 
preauthorization plans and address the specific contexts in which such 
products should and should not be used. In meeting the provisions of 
this paragraph, preauthorization plans may address factors such as the 
potential sources and types of oil that might be spilled, the existence 
and location of environmentally sensitive resources that might be 
impacted by spilled oil, available product and storage locations, 
available equipment and adequately trained operators, and the available 
means to monitor product application and effectiveness. The RRT 
representatives from EPA and the states with jurisdiction over the 
waters of the area to which a preauthorization plan applies and the DOC 
and DOI natural resource trustees shall review and either approve, 
disapprove, or approve with modification the preauthorization plans 
developed by Area Committees, as appropriate. Approved preauthorization 
plans shall be included in the appropriate RCPs and ACPs. If the RRT 
representatives from EPA and the states with jurisdiction over the 
waters of the area to which a preauthorization plan applies and the DOC 
and DOI natural resource trustees approve in advance the use of certain 
products under specified circumstances as described in the 
preauthorization plan, the OSC may authorize the use of the products 
without obtaining the specific concurrences described in paragraphs (b) 
and (c) of this section.
    (b) For spill situations that are not addressed by the 
preauthorization plans developed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section, the OSC, with the concurrence of the EPA representative to the 
RRT and, as appropriate, the concurrence of the RRT representatives from 
the states with jurisdiction over the navigable waters threatened by the 
discharge, and in consultation with the DOC and DOI natural resource 
trustees, when practicable, may authorize the use of dispersants, 
surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, bioremediation 
agents, or miscellaneous oil spill control agents on the oil discharge, 
provided that the products are listed on the NCP Product Schedule.
    (c) The OSC, with the concurrence of the EPA representative to the 
RRT and, as appropriate, the concurrence of the RRT representatives from 
the states with jurisdiction over the navigable waters threatened by the 
discharge, and in consultation with the DOC and DOI natural resource 
trustees, when practicable, may authorize the use of burning agents on a 
case-by-case basis.
    (d) The OSC may authorize the use of any dispersant, surface washing 
agent, surface

[[Page 290]]

collecting agent, other chemical agent, burning agent, bioremediation 
agent, or miscellaneous oil spill control agent, including products not 
listed on the NCP Product Schedule, without obtaining the concurrence of 
the EPA representative to the RRT and, as appropriate, the RRT 
representatives from the states with jurisdiction over the navigable 
waters threatened by the discharge, when, in the judgment of the OSC, 
the use of the product is necessary to prevent or substantially reduce a 
hazard to human life. Whenever the OSC authorizes the use of a product 
pursuant to this paragraph, the OSC is to inform the EPA RRT 
representative and, as appropriate, the RRT representatives from the 
affected states and, when practicable, the DOC/DOI natural resource 
trustees of the use of a product, including products not on the 
Schedule, as soon as possible. Once the threat to human life has 
subsided, the continued use of a product shall be in accordance with 
paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.
    (e) Sinking agents shall not be authorized for application to oil 
discharges.
    (f) When developing preauthorization plans, RRTs may require the 
performance of supplementary toxicity and effectiveness testing of 
products, in addition to the test methods specified in Sec. 300.915 and 
described in appendix C to part 300, due to existing site-specific or 
area-specific concerns.
    4.5  Area response drills. The OSC periodically shall conduct drills 
of removal capability (including fish and wildlife response), without 
prior notice, in areas for which ACPs are required and under relevant 
tank vessel and facility response plans.

                        5.0  Response operations.

    (a) The OSC shall direct response efforts and coordinate all other 
efforts at the scene of a discharge. As part of the planning and 
preparation for response, OSCs shall be predesignated by the regional or 
district head of the lead agency.
    (b) The first federal official affiliated with an NRT member agency 
to arrive at the scene of a discharge should coordinate activities under 
the NCP and is authorized to initiate, in consultation with the OSC, any 
necessary actions normally carried out by the OSC until the arrival of 
the predesignated OSC. This official may initiate federal OSLTF-financed 
actions only as authorized by the OSC or, if the OSC is unavailable, the 
authorized representative of the lead agency.
    (c) The OSC shall, to the extent practicable, collect pertinent 
facts about the discharge, such as its source and cause; the 
identification of responsible parties; the nature, amount, and location 
of discharged materials; the probable direction and time of travel of 
discharged materials; whether the discharge is a worst case discharge; 
the pathways to human and environmental exposure; the potential impact 
on human health, welfare, and safety and the environment; whether the 
discharge poses a substantial threat to the public health or welfare; 
the potential impact on natural resources and property which may be 
affected; priorities for protecting human health and welfare and the 
environment; and appropriate cost documentation.
    (d) The OSC's efforts shall be coordinated with other appropriate 
federal, state, local, and private response agencies. OSCs may designate 
capable persons from federal, state, or local agencies to act as their 
on-scene representatives. State and local governments, however, are not 
authorized to take actions under subpart D of the NCP that involve 
expenditures of the OSLTF unless an appropriate contract or cooperative 
agreement has been established.
    (e) The OSC should consult regularly with the RRT and NSFCC, as 
appropriate, in carrying out the NCP and keep the RRT and NSFCC, as 
appropriate, informed of activities under the NCP.
    (f) The OSC should evaluate incoming information and immediately 
advise FEMA of potential major disaster situations.
    (g) The OSC is responsible for addressing worker health and safety 
concerns at a response scene.
    (h) In those instances where a possible public health emergency 
exists, the OSC should notify the HHS representative to the RRT. 
Throughout response actions, the OSC may call upon the OSHA and HHS 
representative for assistance on worker health and safety issues.
    (i) All federal agencies should plan for emergencies and develop 
procedures for dealing with oil discharges and releases of hazardous 
substances, pollutants, or contaminants from vessels and facilities 
under their jurisdiction. All federal agencies, therefore, are 
responsible for designating the office that coordinates response to such 
incidents in accordance with the NCP and applicable federal regulations 
and guidelines.
    (j)(1) The OSC shall ensure that the natural resource trustees are 
promptly notified of discharges.
    (2) The OSC shall coordinate all response activities with the 
affected natural resource trustees and shall consult with the affected 
trustees on the appropriate removal action to be taken.
    (3) Where the OSC becomes aware that a discharge may affect any 
endangered or threatened species, or their habitat, the OSC shall 
consult with DOI, DOC/NOAA, and, if appropriate, the cognizant federal 
land managing agency.
    (k) The OSC shall submit pollution reports (POLREPs) to the RRT and 
other appropriate agencies as significant developments

[[Page 291]]

occur during response actions, through communications networks or 
procedures agreed to by the RRT and covered in the RCP.
    (l) The OSC should ensure that all appropriate public and private 
interests are kept informed and that their concerns are considered 
throughout a response, to the extent practicable.
    5.1  Phase I--Discovery or notification. (a) A discharge of oil may 
be discovered through:
    (1) A report submitted by the person in charge of a vessel or 
facility, in accordance with statutory requirements;
    (2) Deliberate search by patrols;
    (3) Random or incidental observation by government agencies or the 
public; or
    (4) Other sources.
    (b) Any person in charge of a vessel or a facility shall, as soon as 
he or she has knowledge of any discharge from such vessel or facility in 
violation of section 311(b)(3) of the CWA, immediately notify the NRC. 
Notification shall be made to the NRC Duty Officer, HQ USCG, Washington, 
DC, telephone (800) 424-8802 or (202) 267-2675. If direct reporting to 
the NRC is not practicable, reports may be made to the USCG or EPA 
predesignated OSC for the geographic area where the discharge occurs. 
The EPA predesignated OSC may also be contacted through the regional 24-
hour emergency response telephone number. All such reports shall be 
promptly relayed to the NRC. If it is not possible to notify the NRC or 
predesignated OSC immediately, reports may be made immediately to the 
nearest Coast Guard unit. In any event, such person in charge of the 
vessel or facility shall notify the NRC as soon as possible.
    (c) Any other person shall, as appropriate, notify the NRC of a 
discharge of oil.
    (d) Upon receipt of a notification of discharge, the NRC shall 
promptly notify the OSC. The OSC shall ensure notification of the 
appropriate state agency of any state which is, or may reasonably be 
expected to be, affected by the discharge. The OSC shall then proceed 
with the following phases as outlined in the RCP and ACP.
    5.2  Phase II--Preliminary assessment and initiation of action
    (a) The OSC is responsible for promptly initiating a preliminary 
assessment.
    (b) The preliminary assessment shall be conducted using available 
information, supplemented where necessary and possible by an on-scene 
inspection. The OSC shall undertake actions to:
    (1) Evaluate the magnitude and severity of the discharge or threat 
to public health or welfare or the environment;
    (2) Assess the feasibility of removal; and
    (3) To the extent practicable, identify potentially responsible 
parties.
    (c) Where practicable, the framework for the response management 
structure is a system (e.g., a unified command system), that brings 
together the functions of the federal government, the state government, 
and the responsible party to achieve an effective and efficient 
response, where the OSC maintains authority.
    (d) Except in a case when the OSC is required to direct the response 
to a discharge that may pose a substantial threat to the public health 
or welfare (including, but not limited to fish, shellfish, wildlife, 
other natural resources, and the public and private beaches and 
shorelines of the United States), the OSC may allow the responsible 
party to voluntarily and promptly perform removal actions, provided the 
OSC determines such actions will ensure an effective and immediate 
removal of the discharge or mitigation or prevention of a substantial 
threat of a discharge. If the responsible party does conduct the 
removal, the OSC shall ensure adequate surveillance over whatever 
actions are initiated. If effective actions are not being taken to 
eliminate the threat, or if removal is not being properly done, the OSC 
should, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, so advise the 
responsible party. If the responsible party does not respond properly, 
the OSC shall take appropriate response actions and should notify the 
responsible party of the potential liability for federal response costs 
incurred by the OSC pursuant to the OPA and CWA. Where practicable, 
continuing efforts should be made to encourage response by responsible 
parties.
    (1) In carrying out a response under this section, the OSC may:
    (A) Remove or arrange for the removal of a discharge, and mitigate 
or prevent a substantial threat of a discharge, at any time;
    (B) Direct or monitor all federal, state, and private actions to 
remove a discharge; and
    (C) Remove and, if necessary, destroy a vessel discharging, or 
threatening to discharge, by whatever means are available.
    (2) If the discharge results in a substantial threat to the public 
health or welfare of the United States (including, but not limited to 
fish, shellfish, wildlife, other natural resources, and the public and 
private beaches and shorelines of the United States), the OSC must 
direct all response efforts, as provided in section 5.3.4 of this 
appendix. The OSC should declare as expeditiously as practicable to 
spill response participants that the federal government will direct the 
response. The OSC may act without regard to any other provision of the 
law governing contracting procedures or employment of personnel by the 
federal government in removing or arranging for the removal of such a 
discharge.
    (e) The OSC shall ensure that the natural resource trustees are 
promptly notified in the event of any discharge of oil, to the maximum 
extent practicable as provided in the Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive 
Environments Plan annex to the ACP for the area in which the discharge 
occurs. The OSC and the

[[Page 292]]

trustees shall coordinate assessments, evaluations, investigations, and 
planning with respect to appropriate removal actions. The OSC shall 
consult with the affected trustees on the appropriate removal action to 
be taken. The trustees will provide timely advice concerning recommended 
actions with regard to trustee resources potentially affected. The 
trustees also will assure that the OSC is informed of their activities 
in natural resource damage assessment that may affect response 
operations. The trustees shall assure, through the lead administrative 
trustee, that all data from the natural resource damage assessment 
activities that may support more effective operational decisions are 
provided in a timely manner to the OSC. When circumstances permit, the 
OSC shall share the use of non-monetary response resources (i.e., 
personnel and equipment) with the trustees, provided trustee activities 
do not interfere with response actions. The lead administrative trustee 
facilitates effective and efficient communication between the OSC and 
the other trustees during response operations and is responsible for 
applying to the OSC for non-monetary federal response resources on 
behalf of all trustees. The lead administrative trustee is also 
responsible for applying to the National Pollution Funds Center for 
funding for initiation of damage assessment for injuries to natural 
resources.
    5.3  Patterns of response.
    5.3.1  Determinations to initiate response and special conditions.
    (a) In accordance with the CWA, the Administrator of EPA or the 
Secretary of the department in which the USCG is operating, as 
appropriate, is authorized to act for the United States to take response 
measures deemed necessary to protect the public health or welfare or 
environment from discharges of oil.
    (b) The Administrator of EPA or the Secretary of the department in 
which the USCG is operating, as appropriate, is authorized to initiate 
and, in the case of a discharge posing a substantial threat to public 
health or welfare is required to initiate and direct, appropriate 
response activities when the Administrator or Secretary determines that 
any oil is discharged or there is a substantial threat of such discharge 
from any vessel or offshore or onshore facility into or on the navigable 
waters of the United States, on the adjoining shorelines to the 
navigable waters, into or on the waters of the exclusive economic zone, 
or that may affect natural resources belonging to, appertaining to, or 
under exclusive management authority of the United States.
    (c) In addition to any actions taken by a state or local government, 
the Administrator of EPA or the Secretary of the department in which the 
USCG is operating may request the U.S. Attorney General to secure the 
relief from any person, including the owner or operator of the vessel or 
facility necessary to abate a threat or, after notice to the affected 
state, take any other action authorized by section 311 of the CWA, 
including issuing administrative orders, that may be necessary to 
protect the public health or welfare, if the Administrator or Secretary 
determines that there may be an imminent and substantial threat to the 
public health or welfare or the environment of the United States, 
including fish, shellfish, and wildlife, public and private property, 
shorelines, beaches, habitats, and other living and nonliving natural 
resources under the jurisdiction or control of the United States, 
because of an actual or threatened discharge of oil from any vessel or 
offshore or onshore facility into or upon the navigable waters of the 
United States.
    (d) Response actions to remove discharges originating from 
operations conducted subject to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act 
shall be in accordance with the NCP.
    (e) Where appropriate, when a discharge involves radioactive 
materials, the lead or support federal agency shall act consistent with 
the notification and assistance procedures described in the appropriate 
Federal Radiological Plan. For the purpose of the NCP, the Federal 
Radiological Emergency Response Plan (FRERP) (50 FR 46542, November 8, 
1985) is the appropriate plan. Most radiological discharges and releases 
do not result in FRERP activation and should be handled in accordance 
with the NCP. However, releases from nuclear incidents subject to 
requirements for financial protection established by the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission under the Price-Anderson amendments (section 170) 
of the Atomic Energy Act are specifically excluded from CERCLA and NCP 
requirements.
    (f) Removal actions involving nuclear weapons should be conducted in 
accordance with the joint Department of Defense, Department of Energy, 
and FEMA Agreement for Response to Nuclear Incidents and Nuclear Weapons 
Significant Incidents (January 8, 1981).
    (g) If the situation is beyond the capability of state and local 
governments and the statutory authority of federal agencies, the 
President may, under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, act upon a request 
by the Governor and declare a major disaster or emergency and appoint a 
FCO to coordinate all federal disaster assistance activities. In such 
cases, the OSC would continue to carry out OSC responsibilities under 
the NCP, but would coordinate those activities with the FCO to ensure 
consistency with other federal disaster assistance activities.
    (h) In the event of a declaration of a major disaster by the 
President, FEMA may activate the FRP. An FCO, designated by the 
President, may implement the FRP and coordinate and direct emergency 
assistance

[[Page 293]]

and disaster relief of impacted individuals, business, and public 
services under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act. Delivery of 
federal assistance is facilitated through twelve functional annexes to 
the FRP known as ESFs. EPA coordinates activities under ESF #10--
Hazardous Materials, which addresses preparedness and response to 
hazardous materials and oil incidents caused by a natural disaster or 
other catastrophic event. In such cases, the OSC/RPM should coordinate 
response activities with the FCO, through the incident-specific ESF #10 
Chair, to ensure consistency with federal disaster assistance 
activities.
    5.3.2  General pattern of response. (a) When the OSC receives a 
report of a discharge, actions normally should be taken in the following 
sequence:
    (1) Investigate the report to determine pertinent information such 
as the threat posed to public health or welfare or the environment, the 
type and quantity of polluting material, and the source of the 
discharge.
    (2) Officially classify the size (i.e., minor, medium, major) and 
type (i.e., substantial threat to the public health or welfare, worst 
case discharge) of the discharge and determine the course of action to 
be followed to ensure effective and immediate removal, mitigation, or 
prevention of the discharge. Some discharges that are classified as a 
substantial threat to the public health or welfare may be further 
classified as a spill of national significance by the Administrator of 
EPA or the Commandant of the USCG. The appropriate course of action may 
be prescribed in 5.3.4, 5.3.5, and 5.3.6 of this appendix.
    (A) When the reported discharge is an actual or potential major 
discharge, the OSC shall immediately notify the RRT and the NRC.
    (B) When the investigation shows that an actual or potential medium 
discharge exists, the OSC shall recommend activation of the RRT, if 
appropriate.
    (C) When the investigation shows that an actual or potential minor 
discharge exists, the OSC shall monitor the situation to ensure that 
proper removal action is being taken.
    (3) If the OSC determines that effective and immediate removal, 
mitigation, or prevention of a discharge can be achieved by private 
party efforts, and where the discharge does not pose a substantial 
threat to the public health or welfare, determine whether the 
responsible party or other person is properly carrying out removal. 
Removal is being done properly when:
    (A) The responsible party is applying the resources called for in 
its response plan to effectively and immediately remove, minimize, or 
mitigate threat(s) to public health and welfare and the environment; and
    (B) The removal efforts are in accordance with applicable 
regulations, including the NCP. Even if the OSC supplements responsible 
party resources with government resources, the spill response will not 
be considered improper, unless specifically determined by the OSC.
    (4) Where appropriate, determine whether a state or political 
subdivision thereof has the capability to carry out any or all removal 
actions. If so, the OSC may arrange funding to support these actions.
    (5) Ensure prompt notification of the trustees of affected natural 
resources in accordance with the applicable RCP and ACP.
    (b) Removal shall be considered complete when so determined by the 
OSC in consultation with the Governor or Governors of the affected 
states. When the OSC considers removal complete, OSLTF removal funding 
shall end. This determination shall not preclude additional removal 
actions under applicable state law.
    5.3.3  Containment, countermeasures, and cleanup. (a) Defensive 
actions shall begin as soon as possible to prevent, minimize, or 
mitigate threat(s) to the public health or welfare or the environment. 
Actions may include but are not limited to: analyzing water samples to 
determine the source and spread of the oil; controlling the source of 
discharge; source and spread control or salvage operations; placement of 
physical barriers to deter the spread of the oil and to protect natural 
resources and sensitive ecosystems; measuring and sampling; control of 
the water discharged from upstream impoundment; and the use of chemicals 
and other materials in accordance with subpart J of Part 300 of the NCP 
to restrain the spread of the oil and mitigate its effects. The ACP 
should be consulted for procedures to be followed for obtaining an 
expedited decision regarding the use of dispersants and other products 
listed on the NCP Product Schedule.
    (b) As appropriate, actions shall be taken to recover the oil or 
mitigate its effects. Of the numerous chemical or physical methods that 
may be used, the chosen methods shall be the most consistent with 
protecting public health and welfare and the environment. Sinking agents 
shall not be used.
    (c) Oil and contaminated materials recovered in cleanup operations 
shall be disposed of in accordance with the RCP, ACP, and any applicable 
laws, regulations, or requirements. RRT and Area Committee guidelines 
may identify the disposal options available during an oil spill response 
and may describe what disposal requirements are mandatory or may not be 
waived by the OSC. ACP guidelines should address: the sampling, testing, 
and classifying of recovered oil and oiled debris; the segregation and 
stockpiling of recovered oil and oiled debris; prior state disposal 
approvals and permits; and the

[[Page 294]]

routes; methods (e.g. recycle/reuse, on-site burning, incineration, 
landfilling, etc.); and sites for the disposal of collected oil, oiled 
debris, and animal carcasses; procedures for obtaining waivers, 
exemptions, or authorizations associated with handling or transporting 
waste materials. The ACPs may identify a hierachy of preferences for 
disposal alternatives, with recycling (reprocessing) being the most 
preferred, and other alternatives preferred based on priorities for 
health or the environment.
    5.3.4  Response to a substantial threat to the public health or 
welfare. (a) The OSC shall determine whether a discharge results in a 
substantial threat to public health or welfare (including, but not 
limited to, fish, shellfish, wildlife, other natural resources, the 
public and private beaches, and shorelines of the United States). 
Factors to be considered by the OSC in making this determination 
include, but are not limited to, the size of the discharge, the 
character of the discharge, and the nature of the threat to public 
health or welfare. Upon obtaining such information, the OSC shall 
conduct an evaluation of the threat posed, based on the OSC's experience 
in assessing other discharges and consultation with senior lead agency 
officials and readily available authorities on issues outside the OSC's 
technical expertise.
    (b) If the investigation by the OSC shows that the discharge poses 
or may present a substantial threat to public health or welfare, the OSC 
shall direct all federal, state, or private actions to remove the 
discharge or to mitigate or prevent the threat of such a discharge, as 
appropriate. In directing the response in such cases, the OSC may act 
without regard to any other provision of law governing contracting 
procedures or employment of personnel by the federal government to:
    (1) Remove or arrange for the removal of the discharge;
    (2) Mitigate or prevent the substantial threat of the discharge; and
    (3) Remove and, if necessary, destroy a vessel discharging, or 
threatening to discharge, by whatever means are available.
    (c) In the case of a substantial threat to the public health or 
welfare, the OSC shall:
    (1) Assess opportunities for the use of various special teams and 
other assistance, including the use of the services of the NSFCC, as 
appropriate;
    (2) Request immediate activation of the RRT; and
    (3) Take whatever additional response actions are deemed 
appropriate, including but not limited to implementation of the ACP or 
relevant tank vessel or facility response plan.
    (d) When requested by the OSC, the lead agency or RRT shall dispatch 
appropriate personnel to the scene of the discharge to assist the OSC. 
This assistance may include technical support in the agency's areas of 
expertise and disseminating information to the public. The lead agency 
shall ensure that a contracting officer is available on scene, at the 
request of the OSC.
    5.3.5  Enhanced activities during a spill of national significance. 
(a) A discharge may be classified as an SONS by the Administrator of EPA 
for discharges occurring in the inland zone and the Commandant of the 
USCG for discharges occurring in the coastal zone.
    (b) For an SONS in the inland zone, the EPA Administrator may name a 
senior Agency official to assist the OSC in: (1) Communicating with 
affected parties and the public; and (2) coordinating federal, state, 
local, and international resources at the national level. This strategic 
coordination will involve, as appropriate, the NRT, RRT(s), the 
Governor(s) of affected state(s), and the mayor(s) or other chief 
executive(s) of local government(s).
    (c) For an SONS in the coastal zone, the USCG Commandant may name a 
National Incident Commander (NIC) who will assume the role of the OSC 
in: (1) Communicating with affected parties and the public; and (2) 
coordinating federal, state, local, and international resources at the 
national level. This strategic coordination shall involve, as 
appropriate, the NRT, RRT(s), the Governor(s) of affected state(s), and 
the mayor(s) or other chief executive(s) of local government(s).
    5.3.6  Response to worst case discharges. (a) If the investigation 
by the OSC shows that a discharge is a worst case discharge as defined 
in the ACP, or there is a substantial threat of such a discharge, the 
OSC shall:
    (1) Notify the NSFCC;
    (2) Require, where applicable, implementation of the worst case 
portion of an approved tank vessel or facility response plan;
    (3) Implement the worst case portion of the ACP, if appropriate; and
    (4) Take whatever additional response actions are deemed 
appropriate.
    (b) Under the direction of the OSC, the NSFCC shall coordinate use 
of private and public personnel and equipment, including strike teams, 
to remove a worst case discharge and mitigate or prevent a substantial 
threat of such a discharge.
    5.3.7  Multi-regional responses. (a) If a discharge moves from the 
area covered by one ACP or RCP into another area, the authority for 
response actions should likewise shift. If a discharge affects areas 
covered by two or more ACPs or RCPs, the response mechanisms of each 
applicable plan may be activated. In this case, response actions of all 
regions concerned shall be fully coordinated as detailed in the RCPs and 
ACPs.
    (b) There shall be only one OSC at any time during the course of a 
response operation. Should a discharge affect two or more areas, EPA, 
the USCG, DOD, DOE, or other

[[Page 295]]

lead agency, as appropriate, shall give prime consideration to the area 
vulnerable to the greatest threat, in determining which agency should 
provide the OSC. The RRT shall designate the OSC if the RRT member 
agencies who have response authority within the affected areas are 
unable to agree on the designation. The NRT shall designate the OSC if 
members of one RRT or two adjacent RRTs are unable to agree on the 
designation.
    5.3.8  Worker health and safety. (a) Response actions under the NCP 
shall comply with the provisions for response action worker safety and 
health in 29 CFR 1910.120. The national response system meets the 
requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120 concerning use of an incident command 
system.
    (b) In a response action taken by a responsible party, the 
responsible party must assure that an occupational safety and health 
program consistent with 29 CFR 1910.120 is made available for the 
protection of workers at the response site.
    (c) In a response taken under the NCP by a lead agency, an 
occupational safety and health program should be made available for the 
protection of workers at the response site, consistent with, and to the 
extent required by, 29 CFR 1910.120. Contracts relating to a response 
action under the NCP should contain assurances that the contractor at 
the response site will comply with this program and with any applicable 
provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act) 
and state laws with plans approved under section 18 of the OSH Act.
    (d) When a state, or political subdivision of a state, without an 
OSHA-approved state plan is the lead agency for response, the state or 
political subdivision must comply with standards in 40 CFR part 311, 
promulgated by the EPA pursuant to section 126(f) of the Superfund 
Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA).
    (e) Requirements, standards, and regulations of the OSH Act and of 
state OSH laws not directly referenced in paragraphs (a) through (d) of 
this section, must be complied with where applicable. Federal OSH Act 
requirements include, among other things, Construction Standards (29 CFR 
part 1926), General Industry Standards (29 CFR part 1910), and the 
general duty requirement of section 5(a)(1) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 
654(a)(1)). No action by the lead agency with respect to response 
activities under the NCP constitutes an exercise of statutory authority 
within the meaning of section 4(b)(1) of the OSH Act. All governmental 
agencies and private employers are directly responsible for the health 
and safety of their own employees.

                              5.4  Disposal

    Oil recovered in cleanup operations shall be disposed of in 
accordance with the RCP, ACP, and any applicable laws, regulations, or 
requirements. RRT and ACP guidelines may identify the disposal plans to 
be followed during an oil spill response and may address: the sampling, 
testing, and classifying of recovered oil and oiled debris; the 
segregation and stockpiling of recovered oil and oiled debris; prior 
state disposal approvals and permits; and the routes; methods (e.g., 
recycle/reuse, on-site burning, incineration, landfilling, etc.); and 
sites for the disposal of collected oil, oiled debris, and animal 
carcasses.

                     5.5  Natural Resource Trustees

    5.5.1  Damage assessment. (a) Upon notification or discovery of 
injury to, destruction of, loss of, or threat to natural resources, 
trustees may, pursuant to section 1006 of the OPA, take the following 
actions as appropriate:
    (1) Conduct a preliminary survey of the area affected by the 
discharge to determine if trust resources under their jurisdiction are, 
or potentially may be, affected;
    (2) Cooperate with the OSC in coordinating assessments, 
investigations, and planning;
    (3) Carry out damage assessments; or
    (4) Devise and carry out a plan for restoration, rehabilitation, 
replacement, or acquisition of equivalent natural resources. In 
assessing damages to natural resources, the federal, state, and Indian 
tribe trustees have the option of following the procedures for natural 
resource damage assessments located at 43 CFR part 11.
    (b) Upon notification or discovery of injury to, destruction of, 
loss of, or loss of use of, natural resources, or the potential for 
such, resulting from a discharge of oil occurring after August 18, 1990, 
the trustees, pursuant to section 1006 of the OPA, are to take the 
following actions:
    (1) In accordance with OPA section 1006(c), determine the need for 
assessment of natural resource damages, collect data necessary for a 
potential damage assessment, and, where appropriate, assess damages to 
natural resources under their trusteeship; and
    (2) As appropriate, and subject to the public participation 
requirements of OPA section 1006(c), develop and implement a plan for 
the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of the 
equivalent, of the natural resources under their trusteeship.
    (c)(1) The trustees, consistent with procedures specified in the 
Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments Annex to the Area 
Contingency Plan, shall provide timely advice on recommended actions 
concerning trustee resources that are potentially affected by a 
discharge of oil. This may include providing assistance to the OSC in 
identifying/recommending pre-approved response techniques and in 
predesignating shoreline types and areas in ACPs.
    (2) The trustees shall assure, through the lead administrative 
trustee, that the OSC is

[[Page 296]]

informed of their activities regarding natural resource damage 
assessment that may affect response operations in order to assure 
coordination and minimize any interference with such operations. The 
trustees shall assure, through the lead administrative trustee, that all 
data from the natural resource damage assessment activities that may 
support more effective operational decisions are provided in a timely 
manner to the OSC.
    (3) The OSC deploys federal response resources, including but not 
limited to aircraft, vessels, and booms to contain and remove discharged 
oil. When circumstances permit, the OSC shall share the use of federal 
response resources with the trustees, providing trustee activities do 
not interfere with response actions. The lead administrative trustee 
facilitates effective and efficient communication between the OSC and 
the other trustees during response operations and is responsible for 
applying to the OSC for non-monetary federal response resources on 
behalf of all trustees. The lead administrative trustee is also 
responsible for applying to the National Pollution Funds Center for 
funding for initiation of damage assessment for injuries to natural 
resources.
    (d) The authority of federal trustees includes, but is not limited 
to the following actions:
    (1) Requesting that the Attorney General seek compensation from the 
responsible parties for the damages assessed and for the costs of an 
assessment and of restoration planning;
    (2) Participating in negotiations between the United States and 
potentially responsible parties (PRPs) to obtain PRP-financed or PRP-
conducted assessments and restorations for injured resources or 
protection for threatened resources and to agree to covenants not to 
sue, where appropriate; and
    (3) Initiating damage assessments, as provided in OPA section 6002.
    (e) Actions which may be taken by any trustee pursuant to section 
311(f)(5) of the CWA or section 1006 of the OPA include, but are not 
limited to, any of the following:
    (1) Requesting that an authorized agency issue an administrative 
order or pursue injunctive relief against the parties responsible for 
the discharge; or
    (2) Requesting that the lead agency remove, or arrange for the 
removal of any oil from a contaminated medium pursuant to section 311 of 
the CWA.
    5.5.2  Lead administrative trustee. The lead administrative trustee 
is a natural resource trustee who is designated on an incident-by-
incident basis and chosen by the other trustees whose natural resources 
are affected by the incident. The lead administrative trustee 
facilitates effective and efficient communication between the OSC and 
the other trustees during response operations and is responsible for 
applying to the OSC for non-monetary federal response resources on 
behalf of all trustees. The lead administrative trustee is also 
responsible for applying to the National Pollution Funds Center for 
funding for initiation of damage assessment for injuries to natural 
resources.
    5.5.3  OSC coordination. (a) The OSC shall ensure that the natural 
resource trustees are promptly notified in the event of any discharge of 
oil, to the maximum extent practicable, as provided in the Fish and 
Wildlife and Sensitive Environments Plan annex to the ACP for the area 
in which the discharge occurs. The OSC and the trustees shall coordinate 
assessments, evaluations, investigations, and planning with respect to 
appropriate removal actions. The OSC shall consult with the affected 
trustees on the appropriate removal action to be taken.
    (b) The trustees will provide timely advice concerning recommended 
actions with regard to trustee resources that are potentially affected. 
This may include providing assistance to the OSC in identifying/
recommending pre-approved response techniques, and in predesignating 
shoreline types and areas in ACPs.
    (c) The trustees also will assure that the OSC is informed of their 
activities regarding natural resource damage assessment that may affect 
response operations.
    5.5.4  Dissemination of information. (a) When an incident occurs, it 
is imperative to give the public prompt, accurate information on the 
nature of the incident and the actions underway to mitigate the damage. 
OSCs and community relations personnel should ensure that all 
appropriate public and private interests are kept informed and that 
their concerns are considered throughout a response. They should 
coordinate with available public affairs/community relations resources 
to carry out this responsibility by establishing, as appropriate, a 
Joint Information Center bringing together resources from federal and 
state agencies and the responsible party.
    (b) An on-scene news office may be established to coordinate media 
relations and to issue official federal information on an incident. 
Whenever possible, it will be headed by a representative of the lead 
agency. The OSC determines the location of the on-scene news office, but 
every effort should be made to locate it near the scene of the incident. 
If a participating agency believes public interest warrants the issuance 
of statements and an on-scene news office has not been established, the 
affected agency should recommend its establishment. All federal news 
releases or statements by participating agencies should be cleared 
through the OSC. Information dissemination relating to natural resource 
damage assessment activities shall

[[Page 297]]

be coordinated through the lead administrative trustee. The designated 
lead administrative trustee may assist the OSC by disseminating 
information on issues relating to damage assessment activities. 
Following termination of the removal activity, information dissemination 
on damage assessment activities shall be through the lead administrative 
trustee.
    5.5.5  Responsibilities of trustees. (a) Where there are multiple 
trustees, because of coexisting or contiguous natural resources or 
concurrent jurisdictions, they should coordinate and cooperate in 
carrying out these responsibilities.
    (b) Trustees are responsible for designating to the RRTs and the 
Area Committees, for inclusion in the RCP and the ACP, appropriate 
contacts to receive notifications from the OSCs of discharges.
    (c)(1) Upon notification or discovery of injury to, destruction of, 
loss of, or threat to natural resources, trustees may, pursuant to 
section 311(f)(5) of the CWA, take the following or other actions as 
appropriate:
    (A) Conduct a preliminary survey of the area affected by the 
discharge or release to determine if trust resources under their 
jurisdiction are, or potentially may be, affected;
    (B) Cooperate with the OSC in coordinating assessments, 
investigations, and planning;
    (C) Carry out damage assessments; or
    (D) Devise and carry out a plan for restoration, rehabilitation, 
replacement, or acquisition of equivalent natural resources. In 
assessing damages to natural resources, the federal, state, and Indian 
tribe trustees have the option of following the procedures for natural 
resource damage assessments located at 43 CFR part 11.
    (2) Upon notification or discovery of injury to, destruction of, 
loss of, or loss of use of, natural resources, or the potential for 
such, resulting from a discharge of oil occurring after August 18, 1990, 
the trustees, pursuant to section 1006 of the OPA, are to take the 
following actions:
    (A) In accordance with OPA section 1006(c), determine the need for 
assessment of natural resource damages, collect data necessary for a 
potential damage assessment, and, where appropriate, assess damages to 
natural resources under their trusteeship; and
    (B) As appropriate, and subject to the public participation 
requirements of OPA section 1006(c), develop and implement a plan for 
the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of the 
equivalent, of the natural resources under their trusteeship;
    (3)(A) The trustees, consistent with procedures specified in the 
Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments Annex to the Area 
Contingency Plan, shall provide timely advice on recommended actions 
concerning trustee resources that are potentially affected by a 
discharge of oil. This may include providing assistance to the OSC in 
identifying/recommending pre-approved response techniques and in 
predesignating shoreline types and areas in ACPs.
    (B) The trustees shall assure, through the lead administrative 
trustee, that the OSC is informed of their activities regarding natural 
resource damage assessment that may affect response operations in order 
to assure coordination and minimize any interference with such 
operations. The trustees shall assure, through the lead administrative 
trustee, that all data from the natural resource damage assessment 
activities that may support more effective operational decisions are 
provided in a timely manner to the OSC.
    (C) When circumstances permit, the OSC shall share the use of 
federal response resources (including but not limited to aircraft, 
vessels, and booms to contain and remove discharged oil) with the 
trustees, providing trustee activities do not interfere with response 
actions. The lead administrative trustee facilitates effective and 
efficient communication between the OSC and the other trustees during 
response operations and is responsible for applying to the OSC for non-
monetary federal response resources on behalf of all trustees. The lead 
administrative trustee also is responsible for applying to the National 
Pollution Funds Center for funding for initiation of damage assessment 
for injuries to natural resources.
    (d) The authority of federal trustees includes, but is not limited 
to the following actions:
    (1) Requesting that the Attorney General seek compensation from the 
responsible parties for the damages assessed and for the costs of an 
assessment and of restoration planning; and
    (2) Initiating damage assessments, as provided in OPA section 6002.
    (e) Actions which may be taken by any trustee pursuant to section 
1006 of the OPA include, but are not limited to, any of the following:
    (1) Requesting that an authorized agency issue an administrative 
order or pursue injunctive relief against the parties responsible for 
the discharge or release; or
    (2) Requesting that the lead agency remove, or arrange for the 
removal of, or provide for remedial action with respect to, any oil from 
a contaminated medium pursuant to section 311 of CWA.

                  5.6  Oil spill liability trust fund.

    5.6.1  Funding. (a) The OSLTF is available under certain 
circumstances to fund removal of oil performed under section 311 of the 
CWA. Those circumstances and the procedures for accessing the OSLTF are 
described in 33 CFR Subchapter M. The responsible party is liable for 
costs of federal removal and damages in accordance with section

[[Page 298]]

311(f) of the CWA, section 1002 of the OPA, and other federal laws.
    (b) Response actions other than removal, such as scientific 
investigations not in support of removal actions or law enforcement, 
shall be provided by the agency with legal responsibility for those 
specific actions.
    (c) The funding of a response to a discharge from a federally owned, 
operated, or supervised facility or vessel is the responsibility of the 
owning, operating, or supervising agency if it is a responsible party.
    (d) The following agencies have funds available for certain 
discharge removal actions:
    (1) DOD has two specific sources of funds that may be applicable to 
an oil discharge under appropriate circumstances. This does not consider 
military resources that might be made available under specific 
conditions.
    (i) Funds required for removal of a sunken vessel or similar 
obstruction of navigation are available to the Corps of Engineers 
through Civil Works Appropriations, Operations and Maintenance, General.
    (ii) The U.S. Navy (USN) may conduct salvage operations contingent 
on defense operational commitments, when funded by the requesting 
agency. Such funding may be requested on a direct cite basis.
    (2) Pursuant to Title I of the OPA, the state or states affected by 
a discharge of oil may act where necessary to remove such discharge. 
Pursuant to 33 CFR subchapter M, states may be reimbursed from the OSLTF 
for the reasonable costs incurred in such a removal.
    5.6.2  Claims. (a) Claims are authorized to be presented to the 
OSLTF under section 1013 of the OPA of 1990, for certain uncompensated 
removal costs or uncompensated damages resulting from the discharge, or 
substantial threat of discharge, of oil from a vessel or facility into 
or upon the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or exclusive 
economic zone of the United States.
    (b) Anyone desiring to file a claim against the OSLTF may obtain 
general information on the procedure for filing a claim from the 
Director, National Pollution Funds Center, Suite 1000, 4200 Wilson 
Boulevard, Arlington, Virginia, 22203-1804, (703) 235-4756.

                  5.7  Documentation and Cost Recovery.

    (a) All OSLTF users need to collect and maintain documentation to 
support all actions taken under the CWA. In general, documentation shall 
be sufficient to support full cost recovery for resources utilized and 
shall identify the source and circumstances of the incident, the 
responsible party or parties, and impacts and potential impacts to 
public health and welfare and the environment. Documentation procedures 
are contained in 33 CFR subchapter M.
    (b) When appropriate, documentation shall also be collected for 
scientific understanding of the environment and for research and 
development of improved response methods and technology. Funding for 
these actions is restricted by section 6002 of the OPA.
    (c) As requested by the NRT or RRT, the OSC shall submit to the NRT 
or RRT a complete report on the removal operation and the actions taken. 
The OSC report shall record the situation as it developed, the actions 
taken, the resources committed, and the problems encountered. The RRT 
shall review the OSC report with its comments or recommendations within 
30 days after the RRT has received the OSC report.
    (d) OSCs shall ensure the necessary collection and safeguarding of 
information, samples, and reports. Samples and information shall be 
gathered expeditiously during the response to ensure an accurate record 
of the impacts incurred. Documentation materials shall be made available 
to the trustees of affected natural resources. The OSC shall make 
available to the trustees of affected natural resources information and 
documentation in the OSC's possession that can assist the trustees in 
the determination of actual or potential natural resource injuries.
    (e) Information and reports obtained by the EPA or USCG OSC shall be 
transmitted to the appropriate offices responsible for follow-up 
actions.

                    5.8  National response priorities

    (a) Safety of human life must be given the top priority during every 
response action. This includes any search and rescue efforts in the 
general proximity of the discharge and the insurance of safety of 
response personnel.
    (b) Stabilizing the situation to preclude the event from worsening 
is the next priority. All efforts must be focused on saving a vessel 
that has been involved in a grounding, collision, fire, or explosion, so 
that it does not compound the problem. Comparable measures should be 
taken to stabilize a situation involving a facility, pipeline, or other 
source of pollution. Stabilizing the situation includes securing the 
source of the spill and/or removing the remaining oil from the container 
(vessel, tank, or pipeline) to prevent additional oil spillage, to 
reduce the need for follow-up response action, and to minimize adverse 
impact to the environment.
    (c) The response must use all necessary containment and removal 
tactics in a coordinated manner to ensure a timely, effective response 
that minimizes adverse impact to the environment.
    (d) All parts of this national response strategy should be addressed 
concurrently, but safety and stabilization are the highest priorities. 
The OSC should not delay containment and removal decisions unnecessarily 
and should take actions to minimize adverse impact to the environment 
that begin as soon as a discharge occurs, as well

[[Page 299]]

as actions to minimize further adverse environmental impact from 
additional discharges.
    (e) The priorities set forth in this section are broad in nature, 
and should not be interpreted to preclude the consideration of other 
priorities that may arise on a site-specific basis.

                       6.0  Response coordination

    6.1  Nongovernmental participation. (a) Industry groups, academic 
organizations, and others are encouraged to commit resources for 
response operations. Specific commitments should be listed in the RCP 
and ACP. Those entities required to develop tank vessel and facility 
response plans under CWA section 311(j) must be able to respond to a 
worst case discharge to the maximum extent practicable, and should 
commit sufficient resources to implement other aspects of those plans.
    (b) The technical and scientific information generated by the local 
community, along with information from federal, state, and local 
governments, should be used to assist the OSC in devising response 
strategies where effective standard techniques are unavailable. Such 
information and strategies will be incorporated into the ACP, as 
appropriate. The SSC may act as liaison between the OSC and such 
interested organizations.
    (c) ACPs shall establish procedures to allow for well organized, 
worthwhile, and safe use of volunteers, including compliance with 
requirements regarding worker health and safety. ACPs should provide for 
the direction of volunteers by the OSC or by other federal, state, or 
local officials knowledgeable in contingency operations and capable of 
providing leadership. ACPs also should identify specific areas in which 
volunteers can be used, such as beach surveillance, logistical support, 
and bird and wildlife treatment. Unless specifically requested by the 
OSC, volunteers generally should not be used for physical removal or 
remedial activities. If, in the judgment of the OSC, dangerous 
conditions exist, volunteers shall be restricted from on-scene 
operations.
    (d) Nongovernmental participation must be in compliance with the 
requirements of subpart H of the NCP if any recovery of costs will be 
sought.

                     6.2  Natural resource trustees.

    6.2.1 Federal agencies. (a) The President is required to designate 
in the NCP those federal officials who are to act on behalf of the 
public as trustees for natural resources. These designated federal 
officials shall act pursuant to section 1006 of the OPA. ``Natural 
resources'' means land, fish, wildlife, biota, air, water, ground water, 
drinking water supplies, and other such resources belonging to, managed 
by, held in trust by, appertaining to, or otherwise controlled 
(hereinafter referred to as ``managed or controlled'') by the United 
States, including the resources of the exclusive economic zone.
    (b) The following individuals shall be the designated trustee(s) for 
general categories of natural resources, including their supporting 
ecosystems. They are authorized to act pursuant to section 1006 of the 
OPA when there is injury to, destruction of, loss of, or threat to 
natural resources, including their supporting ecosystems as a result of 
a discharge of oil. Notwithstanding the other designations in this 
section, the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior shall act as 
trustees of those resources subject to their respective management or 
control.
    (1) The Secretary of Commerce shall act as trustee for natural 
resources managed or controlled by DOC and for natural resources managed 
or controlled by other federal agencies and that are found in, under, or 
using waters navigable by deep draft vessels, tidally influenced waters 
or waters of the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone, and the 
outer continental shelf. However, before the Secretary takes an action 
with respect to an affected resource under the management or control of 
another federal agency, he shall, whenever practicable, seek to obtain 
concurrence of that other federal agency. Examples of the Secretary's 
trusteeship include the following natural resources and their supporting 
ecosystems: marine fishery resources; anadromous fish; endangered 
species and marine mammals; and the resources of National Marine 
Sanctuaries and National Estuarine Research Reserves.
    (2) The Secretary of the Interior shall act as trustee for natural 
resources managed or controlled by DOI. Examples of the Secretary's 
trusteeship include the following natural resources and their supporting 
ecosystems: migratory birds; anadromous fish; endangered species and 
marine mammals; federally owned minerals; and certain federally managed 
water resources. The Secretary of the Interior shall also be trustee for 
those natural resources for which an Indian tribe would otherwise act as 
trustee in those cases where the United States acts on behalf of the 
Indian tribe.
    (3) Secretary for the land managing agency. For natural resources 
located on, over, or under land administered by the United States, the 
trustee shall be the head of the department in which the land managing 
agency is found. The trustees for the principal federal land managing 
agencies are the Secretaries of DOI, USDA, DOD, and DOE.
    (4) Head of Authorized Agencies. For natural resources located 
within the United States but not otherwise described in this section, 
the trustee is the head of the federal agency or agencies authorized to 
manage or control those resources.

[[Page 300]]

    6.2.2  State. (a) State trustees shall act on behalf of the public 
as trustees for natural resources, including their supporting 
ecosystems, within the boundary of a state or belonging to, managed by, 
controlled by, or appertaining to such state. For the purposes of 
section 6.1, the definition of the term ``state'' does not include 
Indian tribes.
    (b) The Governor of a state is encouraged to designate a lead state 
trustee to coordinate all state trustee responsibilities with other 
trustee agencies and with response activities of the RRT and OSC. The 
state's lead trustee would designate a representative to serve as a 
contact with the OSC. This individual should have ready access to 
appropriate state officials with environmental protection, emergency 
response, and natural resource responsibilities. The EPA Administrator 
or USCG Commandant or their designees may appoint the lead state trustee 
as a member of the Area Committee. Response strategies should be 
coordinated between the state and other trustees and the OSC for 
specific natural resource locations in an inland or coastal zone, and 
should be included in the Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments 
Plan annex of the ACP.
    6.2.3  Indian tribes. The tribal chairmen (or heads of the governing 
bodies) of Indian tribes, as defined in section 1.5, or a person 
designated by the tribal officials, shall act on behalf of the Indian 
tribes as trustees for the natural resources, including their supporting 
ecosystems, belonging to, managed by, controlled by, or appertaining to 
such Indian tribe, or held in trust for the benefit of such Indian 
tribe, or belonging to a member of such Indian tribe, if such resources 
are subject to a trust restriction on alienation. When the tribal 
chairman or head of the tribal governing body designates another person 
as trustee, the tribal chairman or head of the tribal governing body 
shall notify the President of such designation.
    6.2.4  Foreign trustees. Pursuant to section 1006 of the OPA, 
foreign trustees shall act on behalf of the head of a foreign government 
as trustees for natural resources belonging to, managed by, controlled 
by, or appertaining to such foreign government.

                         6.3  Federal agencies.

    (a) Federal agencies listed in this appendix have duties established 
by statute, executive order, or Presidential directive which may apply 
to federal response actions following, or in prevention of, the 
discharge of oil. Some of these agencies also have duties relating to 
the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of 
equivalent natural resources injured or lost as a result of such 
discharge. The NRT, RRT, and Area Committee organizational structure, 
and the NCP, RCPs, and ACPs provide for agencies to coordinate with each 
other in carrying out these duties.
    (b) Federal agencies may be called upon by an OSC during response 
planning and implementation to provide assistance in their respective 
areas of expertise, consistent with the agencies' capabilities and 
authorities.
    (c) In addition to their general responsibilities, federal agencies 
should:
    (1) Make necessary information available to the Secretary of the 
NRT, RRTs, Area Committees, and OSCs;
    (2) Provide representatives to the NRT and RRTs and otherwise assist 
RRTs and OSCs, as necessary, in formulating RCPs and ACPs; and
    (3) Inform the NRT, RRTs, and Area Committees consistent with 
national security considerations, of changes in the availability of 
resources that would affect the operations implemented under the NCP.
    (d) All federal agencies must report discharges of oil, as required 
in 40 CFR part 110, from vessels or facilities under their jurisdiction 
or control to the NRC.

                      6.4  Other Federal agencies.

    6.4.1  Department of Commerce. (a) The DOC, through NOAA, provides 
scientific support for response and contingency planning in coastal and 
marine areas, including assessments of the hazards that may be involved, 
predictions of movement and dispersion of oil through trajectory 
modeling, and information on the sensitivity of coastal environments to 
oil and associated cleanup and mitigation methods; provides expertise on 
living marine resources and their habitats, including endangered 
species, marine mammals and National Marine Sanctuary ecosystems; and 
provides information on actual and predicted meteorological, 
hydrological, ice, and oceanographic conditions for marine, coastal, and 
inland waters, and tide and circulation data for coastal and territorial 
waters and for the Great Lakes. In addition to this expertise, NOAA 
provides SSCs in the coastal zone, as described under section 3.3.3 of 
this appendix, Special teams.
    6.4.2  Department of Justice. The DOJ can provide expert advice on 
complicated legal questions arising from discharges, and federal agency 
responses. In addition, the DOJ represents the federal government, 
including its agencies, in litigation relating to such discharges. Other 
legal issues or questions shall be directed to the federal agency 
counsel for the agency providing the OSC for the response.
    6.4.3  Department of Defense. The DOD has responsibility to take all 
action necessary with respect to discharges where either the discharge 
is on, or the sole source of a discharge is from, any facility or vessel 
under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of DOD. In addition to those 
capabilities provided by SUPSALV, DOD may also, consistent with its 
operational requirements and upon request of the OSC, provide locally 
deployed

[[Page 301]]

USN oil spill response equipment and provide assistance to other federal 
agencies upon request. The following two branches of DOD have 
particularly relevant expertise:
    (a) The United States Army Corps of Engineers has specialized 
equipment and personnel for maintaining navigation channels, for 
removing navigation obstructions, for accomplishing structural repairs, 
and for performing maintenance to hydropower electric generating 
equipment. The Corps can also provide design services, perform 
construction, and provide contract writing and contract administrative 
services for other federal agencies.
    (b) The U.S. Navy Supervisor of Salvage (SUPSLAV) is the branch of 
the service within DOD most knowledgeable and experienced in ship 
salvage, shipboard damage control, and diving. The USN has an extensive 
array of specialized equipment and personnel available for use in these 
areas as well as specialized containment, collection, and removal 
equipment specifically designed for salvage-related and open-sea 
pollution incidents.
    6.4.4  Department of Health and Human Services. (a) The HHS assists 
with the assessment, preservation, and protection of human health and 
helps ensure the availability of essential human services. HHS provides 
technical and nontechnical assistance in the form of advice, guidance, 
and resources to other federal agencies as well as state and local 
governments.
    (b) The principal HHS response comes from the U.S. Public Health 
Service and is coordinated from the Office of the Assistant Secretary 
for Health, and various Public Health Service regional offices. Within 
the Public Health Service, the primary response to a hazardous materials 
emergency comes from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease 
Registry (ATSDR) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Both ATSDR 
and CDC have a 24-hour emergency response capability wherein scientific 
and technical personnel are available to provide technical assistance to 
the lead federal agency and state and local response agencies on human 
health threat assessment and analysis, and exposure prevention and 
mitigation. Such assistance is used for situations requiring evacuation 
of affected areas, human exposure to hazardous materials, and technical 
advice on mitigation and prevention. CDC takes the lead during petroleum 
releases regulated under the CWA and OPA while ATSDR takes the lead 
during chemical releases under CERCLA. Both agencies are mutually 
supportive.
    (c) Other Public Health Service agencies involved in support during 
hazardous materials incidents either directly or through ATSDR/CDC 
include the Food and Drug Administration, the Health Resources and 
Services Administration, the Indian Health Service, and the National 
Institutes of Health.
    (d) Statutory authority for HHS/National Institutes for 
Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) involvement in hazardous materials 
accident prevention is non-regulatory in nature and focused on two 
primary areas for preventing community and worker exposure to hazardous 
materials releases: (1) worker safety training and (2) basic research 
activities. Under section 126 of the SARA, NIEHS is given statutory 
authority for supporting development of curricula and model training 
programs for waste workers and chemical emergency responders. Under 
section 118(b) of the Hazardous Materials Transportation and Uniform 
Safety Act, NIEHS also administers the Hazmat Employee Training Program 
to prepare curricula and training for hazardous materials transportation 
workers. In the basic research arena, NIEHS is authorized under section 
311 of SARA to conduct a hazardous substance basic research and training 
program to evaluate toxic effects and assess human health risks from 
accidental releases of hazardous materials. Under Title IX, section 
901(h) of the Clean Air Act Amendments, NIEHS also is authorized to 
conduct basic research on air pollutants, as well as train physicians in 
environmental health. Federal research and training in hazardous 
materials release prevention represents an important non-regulatory 
activity and supplements ongoing private sector programs.
    6.4.5  Department of the Interior. The DOI may be contacted through 
Regional Environmental Officers, who are the designated members of RRTs. 
Department land managers have jurisdiction over the national park 
system, national wildlife refuges and fish hatcheries, the public lands, 
and certain water projects in western states. In addition, bureaus and 
offices have relevant expertise as follows:
    (a) United States Fish and Wildlife Service and other Bureaus: 
Anadromous and certain other fishes and wildlife, including endangered 
and threatened species, migratory birds, and certain marine mammals; 
waters and wetlands; and effects on natural resources.
    (b) The National Biological Survey performs research in support of 
biological resource management; inventories, monitors, and reports on 
the status and trends in the Nation's biotic resources; and transfers 
the information gained in research and monitoring to resource managers 
and others concerned with the care, use, and conservation of the 
Nation's natural resources. The National Biological Survey has 
laboratory/research facilities.
    (c) Geological Survey: Geology, hydrology (ground water and surface 
water), and natural hazards.

[[Page 302]]

    (d) Bureau of Land Management: Minerals, soils, vegetation, 
wildlife, habitat, archaeology, and wilderness.
    (e) Minerals Management Service: Oversight of offshore oil and gas 
exploration and production facilities and associated pipeline facilities 
under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and the CWA; oil spill 
response technology research; and establishing oil discharge contingency 
planning requirements for offshore facilities.
    (f) Bureau of Mines: Analysis and identification of inorganic 
hazardous substances and technical expertise in metals and metallurgy 
relevant to site cleanup.
    (g) Office of Surface Mining: Coal mine wastes and land reclamation.
    (h) National Park Service: General biological, natural, and cultural 
resource managers to evaluate, measure, monitor, and contain threats to 
park system lands and resources; archaeological and historical expertise 
in protection, preservation, evaluation, impact mitigation, and 
restoration of cultural resources; emergency personnel.
    (i) Bureau of Reclamation: Operation and maintenance of water 
projects in the West; engineering and hydrology; and reservoirs.
    (j) Bureau of Indian Affairs: Coordination of activities affecting 
Indian lands; assistance in identifying Indian tribal government 
officials.
    (k) Office of Territorial Affairs: Assistance in implementing the 
NCP in American Somoa, Guam, the Pacific Island Governments, the 
Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands.
    6.4.6  Department of Justice. The DOJ can provide expert advice on 
complicated legal questions arising from discharges, and federal agency 
responses. In addition, the DOJ represents the federal government, 
including its agencies, in litigation relating to such discharges. Other 
legal issues or questions shall be directed to the federal agency 
counsel for the agency providing the OSC for the response.
    6.4.7  Department of Labor. The DOL, through OSHA and the states 
operating plans approved under section 18 of the OSH Act, has authority 
to conduct safety and health inspections of hazardous waste sites to 
assure that employees are being protected and to determine if the site 
is in compliance with:
    (a) Safety and health standards and regulations promulgated by OSHA 
(or the states) in accordance with section 126 of SARA and all other 
applicable standards; and
    (b) Regulations promulgated under the OSH Act and its general duty 
clause. OSHA inspections may be self-generated, consistent with its 
program operations and objectives, or may be conducted in response to 
requests from EPA or another lead agency, or in response to accidents or 
employee complaints. On request, OSHA shall provide advice and 
consultation to EPA and other NRT/RRT agencies as well as to the OSC 
regarding hazards to persons engaged in response activities. OSHA may 
also take any other action necessary to assure that employees are 
properly protected at such response activities. Any questions about 
occupational safety and health at these sites may be referred to the 
OSHA Regional Office.
    6.4.8  Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA provides guidance, 
policy and program advice, and technical assistance in hazardous 
materials, chemical, and radiological emergency preparedness activities 
(including planning, training, and exercising). FEMA's primary point of 
contact for administering financial and technical assistance to state 
and local governments to support their efforts to develop and maintain 
an effective emergency management and response capability is the 
Preparedness, Training, and Exercises Directorate.
    6.4.9  Department of Energy. The DOE generally provides designated 
OSCs that are responsible for taking all response actions with respect 
to releases where either the release is on, or the sole source of the 
release is from, any facility or vessel under its jurisdiction, custody, 
or control, including vessels bareboat-chartered and operated. In 
addition, under the FRERP, DOE provides advice and assistance to other 
OSCs/RPMs for emergency actions essential for the control of immediate 
radiological hazards. Incidents that qualify for DOE radiological advice 
and assistance are those believed to involve source, by-product, or 
special nuclear material or other ionizing radiation sources, including 
radium, and other naturally occurring radionuclides, as well as particle 
accelerators. Assistance is available through direct contact with the 
appropriate DOE Radiological Assistance Program Regional Office.
    6.4.10  Department of State. The DOS will lead in the development of 
international joint contingency plans. It will also help to coordinate 
an international response when discharges or releases cross 
international boundaries or involve foreign flag vessels. Additionally, 
DOS will coordinate requests for assistance from foreign governments and 
U.S. proposals for conducting research at incidents that occur in waters 
of other countries.
    6.4.11  General Services Administration. The GSA provides logistic 
and telecommunications support to federal agencies. During an emergency 
situation, GSA quickly responds to aid state and local governments as 
directed by other Federal Agencies. The type of support provided might 
include leasing and furnishing office space, setting up 
telecommunications and transportation services, and advisory assistance.
    6.4.12  Department of Transportation. DOT provides response 
expertise pertaining to

[[Page 303]]

transportation of oil by all modes of transportation. DOT, through RSPA, 
establishes oil discharge contingency planning requirements for 
pipelines, transport by rail and containers or bulk transport of oil.

             6.5  States and local participation in response.

    (a) Each state Governor is requested to designate one state office/
representative to represent the state on the appropriate RRT. The 
state's office/representative may participate fully in all activities of 
the appropriate RRT. Each state Governor is also requested to designate 
a lead state agency that shall direct state-lead response operations. 
This agency is responsible for designating the OSC for state-lead 
response actions, and coordinating/communicating with any other state 
agencies, as appropriate. Local governments are invited to participate 
in activities on the appropriate RRT as may be provided by state law or 
arranged by the state's representative. Indian tribes wishing to 
participate should assign one person or office to represent the tribal 
government on the appropriate RRT.
    (b) Appropriate state and local officials (including Indian tribes) 
shall participate as part of the response structure as provided in the 
ACP.
    (c) In addition to meeting the requirements for local emergency 
plans under SARA section 303, state and local government agencies are 
encouraged to include contingency planning for responses, consistent 
with the NCP, RCP, and ACP in all emergency and disaster planning.
    (d) For facilities not addressed under the CWA for oil discharges, 
states are encouraged to undertake response actions themselves or to use 
their authorities to compel potentially responsible parties to undertake 
response actions.
    (e) Because state and local public safety organizations would 
normally be the first government representatives at the scene of a 
discharge or release, they are expected to initiate public safety 
measures that are necessary to protect the public health and welfare and 
that are consistent with containment and cleanup requirements in the 
NCP, and are responsible for directing evacuations pursuant to existing 
state or local procedures.

  hazardous air pollutant and , thus, a CERCLA hazardous substance.                                                                                     
<SUP>bThe CAA Amendments of 1990 list DDE (3547-04-4) as a CAA hazardous air pollutant. The CAS number, 3547-04-4, is for the chemical, p,p'-                
  dichlorodiphenylethane. DDE or p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, CAS number 72-55-9, is already listed in Table 302.4 with a final RQ of 1 pound.
  The substance identified by the CAS number 3547-04-4 has been evaluated and listed as DDE to be consistent with the CAA section 112 listing, as       
  amended.

Ci--Curie. The curie represents a rate of radioactive decay. One curie  
  is the quantity of any radioactive nuclide which undergoes 3.7E 10    
  disintegrations per second.                                           
Bq--Becquerel. The becquerel represents a rate of radioactive decay. One
  becquerel is the quantity of any radioactive nuclide which undergoes  
  one disintegration per second. One curie is equal to 3.7E 10          
  becquerel.                                                            
<SUP>@--Final RQs for all radionuclides apply to chemical compounds          
  containing the radionuclides and elemental forms regardless of the    
  diameter of pieces of solid material.                                 
&--The adjusted RQ of one curie applies to all radionuclides not        
  otherwise listed. Whenever the RQs in Table 302.4 and this appendix to
  the table are in conflict, the lowest RQ shall apply. For example,    
  uranyl acetate and uranyl nitrate have adjusted RQs shown in Table    
  302.4 of 100 pounds, equivalent to about one-tenth the RQ level for   
  uranium-238 listed in this appendix.                                  
E--Exponent to the base 10. For example, 1.3E 2 is equal to 130 while   
  1.3E 3 is equal to 1300.                                              
m--Signifies a nuclear isomer which is a radionuclide in a higher energy
  metastable state relative to the parent isotope.                      
<greek-ph>--Notification requirements for releases of mixtures or       
  solutions of radionuclides can be found in Section 302.6(b) of this   
  rule. Final RQs for the following four common radionuclide mixtures   
  are provided: radium-226 in secular equilibrium with its daughters    
  (0.053 curie); natural uranium (0.1 curie); natural uranium in secular
  equilibrium with its daughters (0.052 curie); and natural thorium in  
  secular equilibrium with its daughters (0.011 curie).

Sec. 302.5  Determination of reportable quantities.

    (a) Listed hazardous substances. The quantity listed in the column 
``Final RQ'' for each substance in Table 302.4, or in appendix B to 
Table 302.4, is the reportable quantity (RQ) for that substance. The RQs 
in Table 302.4 are in units of pounds based on chemical toxicity, while 
the RQs in appendix B to Table 302.4 are in units of curies based on 
radiation hazard. Whenever the RQs in Table 302.4 and appendix B to the 
table are in conflict, the lowest RQ shall apply.
    (b) Unlisted hazardous substances. Unlisted hazardous substances 
designated by 40 CFR 302.4(b) have the reportable quantity of 100 
pounds, except for those unlisted hazardous wastes which exhibit 
extraction procedure (EP) toxicity identified in 40 CFR 261.24. Unlisted 
hazardous wastes which exhibit EP toxicity have the reportable 
quantities listed in Table 302.4 for the contaminant on which the 
characteristic of EP toxicity is based. The reportable quantity applies 
to the waste itself, not merely to the toxic contaminant. If an unlisted 
hazardous waste exhibits EP toxicity on the basis of more than one 
contaminant, the reportable quantity for that waste shall be the lowest 
of the reportable quantities listed in Table 302.4 for those 
contaminants. If an unlisted hazardous waste exhibits the characteristic 
of EP toxicity and one or more of the other characteristics referenced 
in 40 CFR 302.4(b), the reportable quantity for that waste shall be the 
lowest of the applicable reportable quantities.

Sec. 302.6  Notification requirements.

    (a) Any person in charge of a vessel or an offshore or an onshore 
facility shall, as soon as he has knowledge of any release (other than a 
federally permitted release or application of a pesticide) of a 
hazardous substance from such vessel or facility in a quantity equal to 
or exceeding the reportable quantity determined by this part in any 24-
hour period, immediately notify the National Response Center ((800) 424-
8802; in Washington, DC (202) 426-2675).
    (b) Releases of mixtures or solutions (including hazardous waste 
streams) of
    (1) Hazardous substances, except for radionuclides, are subject to 
the following notification requirements:
    (i) if the quantity of all of the hazardous constituent(s) of the 
mixture or solution is known, notification is required where an RQ or 
more of any hazardous constituent is released; or
    (ii) if the quantity of one or more of the hazardous constituent(s) 
of the mixture or solution is unknown, notification is required where 
the total amount of the mixture or solution released equals or exceeds 
the RQ for the

[[Page 379]]

hazardous constituent with the lowest RQ.
    (2) Radionuclides are subject to this section's notification 
requirements only in the following circumstances:
    (i) If the identity and quantity (in curies) of each radionuclide in 
a released mixture or solution is known, the ratio between the quantity 
released (in curies) and the RQ for the radionuclide must be determined 
for each radionuclide. The only such releases subject to this section's 
notification requirements are those in which the sum of the ratios for 
the radionuclides in the mixture or solution released is equal to or 
greater than one.
    (ii) If the identity of each radionuclide in a released mixture or 
solution is known but the quantity released (in curies) of one or more 
of the radionuclides is unknown, the only such releases subject to this 
section's notification requirements are those in which the total 
quantity (in curies) of the mixture or solution released is equal to or 
greater than the lowest RQ of any individual radionuclide in the mixture 
or solution.
    (iii) If the identity of one or more radionuclides in a released 
mixture or solution is unknown (or if the identity of a radionuclide 
released by itself is unknown), the only such releases subject to this 
section's notification requirements are those in which the total 
quantity (in curies) released is equal to or greater than either one 
curie or the lowest RQ of any known individual radionuclide in the 
mixture or solution, whichever is lower.
    (c) The following categories of releases are exempt from the 
notification requirements of this section: (1) Releases of those 
radionuclides that occur naturally in the soil from land holdings such 
as parks, golf courses, or other large tracts of land; (2) releases of 
radionuclides occurring naturally from the disturbance of land for 
purposes other than mining, such as for agricultural or construction 
activities; (3) releases of radionuclides from the dumping of coal and 
coal ash at utility and industrial facilities with coal-fired boilers; 
and (4) releases of radionuclides from coal and coal ash piles at 
utility and industrial facilities with coal-fired boilers.
    (d) Except for releases of radionuclides, notification of the 
release of an RQ of solid particles of antimony, arsenic, beryllium, 
cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, selenium, silver, thallium, or 
zinc is not required if the mean diameter of the particles released is 
larger than 100 micrometers (0.004 inches).

Sec. 302.7  Penalties.

    (a) Any person--
    (1) In charge of a vessel from which a hazardous substance is 
released, other than a federally permitted release, into or upon the 
navigable waters of the United States, adjoining shorelines, or into or 
upon the waters of the contiguous zone,
    (2) In charge of a vessel from which a hazardous substance is 
released, other than a federally permitted release, which may affect 
natural resources belonging to, appertaining to, or under the exclusive 
management authority of the United States (including resources under the 
Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976), and who is otherwise 
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States at the time of the 
release, or
    (3) In charge of a facility from which a hazardous substance is 
released, other than a federally permitted release, in a quantity equal 
to or greater than that reportable quantity determined under this part 
who fails to notify immediately the National Response Center as soon as 
he has knowledge of such release shall be subject to all of the 
sanctions, including criminal penalties, set forth in section 103 of the 
Act with respect to such failure to notify.
    (b) Notification received pursuant to this section or information 
obtained by the exploitation of such notification shall not be used 
against any such person in any criminal case, except a prosecution for 
perjury or for giving a false statement.
    (c) This section shall not apply to the application of a pesticide 
product registered under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and 
Rodenticide Act or to

[[Page 380]]

the handling and storage of such a pesticide product by an agricultural 
producer.


<R05>
Sec. 302.8  Continuous releases.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no 
notification is required for any release of a hazardous substance that 
is, pursuant to the definitions in paragraph (b) of this section, 
continuous and stable in quantity and rate.
    (b) Definitions. The following definitions apply to notification of 
continuous releases:
    Continuous. A continuous release is a release that occurs without 
interruption or abatement or that is routine, anticipated, and 
intermittent and incidental to normal operations or treatment processes.
    Normal range. The normal range of a release is all releases (in 
pounds or kilograms) of a hazardous substance reported or occurring over 
any 24-hour period under normal operating conditions during the 
preceding year. Only releases that are both continuous and stable in 
quantity and rate may be included in the normal range.
    Routine. A routine release is a release that occurs during normal 
operating procedures or processes.
    Stable in quantity and rate. A release that is stable in quantity 
and rate is a release that is predictable and regular in amount and rate 
of emission.
    Statistically significant increase. A statistically significant 
increase in a release is an increase in the quantity of the hazardous 
substance released above the upper bound of the reported normal range of 
the release.
    (c) Notification. The following notifications shall be given for any 
release qualifying for reduced reporting under this section:
    (1) Initial telephone notification;
    (2) Initial written notification within 30 days of the initial 
telephone notification;
    (3) Follow-up notification within 30 days of the first anniversary 
date of the initial written notification;
    (4) Notification of a change in the composition or source(s) of the 
release or in the other information submitted in the initial written 
notification of the release under paragraph (c)(2) of this section or 
the follow-up notification under paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and
    (5) Notification at such times as an increase in the quantity of the 
hazardous substance being released during any 24-hour period represents 
a statistically significant increase as defined in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (d) Initial telephone notification. Prior to making an initial 
telephone notification of a continuous release, the person in charge of 
a facility or vessel must establish a sound basis for qualifying the 
release for reporting under CERCLA section 103(f)(2) by:
    (1) Using release data, engineering estimates, knowledge of 
operating procedures, or best professional judgment to establish the 
continuity and stability of the release;
    (2) Reporting the release to the National Response Center for a 
period sufficient to establish the continuity and stability of the 
release; or
    (3) When a person in charge of the facility or vessel believes that 
a basis has been established to qualify the release for reduced 
reporting under this section, initial notification to the National 
Response Center shall be made by telephone. The person in charge must 
identify the notification as an initial continuous release notification 
report and provide the following information:
    (i) The name and location of the facility or vessel; and
    (ii) The name(s) and identity(ies) of the hazardous substance(s) 
being released.
    (e) Initial written notification. Initial written notification of a 
continuous release shall be made to the appropriate EPA Regional Office 
for the geographical area where the releasing facility or vessel is 
located. (Note: In addition to the requirements of this part, releases 
of CERCLA hazardous substances are also subject to the provisions of 
SARA title III section 304, and EPA's implementing regulations codified 
at 40 CFR part 355, which require initial telephone and written 
notifications of continuous releases to be submitted to the appropriate 
State emergency response commission and local emergency planning 
committee.)

    (g) Notification of changes in the release. If there is a change in 
the release, notification of the change, not otherwise reported, shall 
be provided in the following manner:
    (1) Change in source or composition. If there is any change in the 
composition or source(s) of the release, the release is a new release 
and must be qualified for reporting under this section by the submission 
of initial telephone notification and initial written notification in 
accordance with paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section as soon as 
there is a sufficient basis for asserting that the release is continuous 
and stable in quantity and rate;
    (2) Change in the normal range. If there is a change in the release 
such that the quantity of the release exceeds the upper bound of the 
reported normal range, the release must be reported as a statistically 
significant increase in the release. If a change will result in a number 
of releases that exceed the upper bound of the normal range, the person 
in charge of a facility or vessel may modify the normal range by:
    (i) Reporting at least one statistically significant increase report 
as required under paragraph (c)(7) of this section and, at the same 
time, informing the National Response Center of the change in the normal 
range; and
    (ii) Submitting, within 30 days of the telephone notification, 
written notification to the appropriate EPA Regional Office describing 
the new normal range, the reason for the change, and the basis for 
stating that the release in the increased amount is continuous and 
stable in quantity and rate under the definitions in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (3) Changes in other reported information. If there is a change in 
any information submitted in the initial written notification or the 
followup notification other than a change in the source, composition, or 
quantity of the release, the person in charge of the facility or vessel 
shall provide written notification of the change to the EPA Region for 
the geographical area where the facility or vessel is located, within 30 
days of determining that the information submitted previously is no 
longer valid. Notification shall include the reason for the change, and 
the basis for stating that the release is continuous and stable under 
the changed conditions.
    (4) Notification of changes shall include the case number assigned 
by the National Response Center or the Environmental Protection Agency 
and also

[[Page 383]]

the signed certification statement required at (c)(2)(xi) of this 
section.
    (h) Notification of a statistically significant increase in a 
release. Notification of a statistically significant increase in a 
release shall be made to the National Response Center as soon as the 
person in charge of the facility or vessel has knowledge of the 
increase. The release must be identified as a statistically significant 
increase in a continuous release. A determination of whether an increase 
is a ``statistically significant increase'' shall be made based upon 
calculations or estimation procedures that will identify releases that 
exceed the upper bound of the reported normal range.
    (i) Annual evaluation of releases. Each hazardous substance release 
shall be evaluated annually to determine if changes have occurred in the 
information submitted in the initial written notification, the followup 
notification, and/or in a previous change notification.
    (j) Use of the SARA Title III section 313 form. In lieu of an 
initial written report or a followup report, owners or operators of 
facilities subject to the requirements of SARA title III section 313 may 
submit to the appropriate EPA Regional Office for the geographical area 
where the facility is located, a copy of the Toxic Release Inventory 
form submitted under SARA Title III section 313 the previous July 1, 
provided that the following information is added:
    (1) The population density within a one-mile radius of the facility 
or vessel, described in terms of the following ranges: 0-50 persons, 51-
100 persons, 101-500 persons, 501-1,000 persons, more than 1,000 
persons.
    (2) The identity and location of sensitive populations and 
ecosystems within a one-mile radius of the facility or vessel (e.g., 
elementary schools, hospitals, retirement communities, or wetlands).
    (3) For each hazardous substance release claimed to qualify for 
reporting under CERCLA section 103(f)(2), the following information must 
be supplied:
    (i) The upper and lower bounds of the normal range of the release 
(in pounds or kilograms) over the previous year.
    (ii) The frequency of the release and the fraction of the release 
from each release source and the specific period over which it occurs.
    (iii) A brief statement describing the basis for stating that the 
release is continuous and stable in quantity and rate.
    (iv) A signed statement that the hazardous substance release(s) 
is(are) continuous and stable in quantity and rate under the definitions 
in paragraph (b) of this section and that all reported information is 
accurate and current to the best knowledge of the person in charge.
    (k) Documentation supporting notification. Where necessary to 
satisfy the requirements of this section, the person in charge may rely 
on recent release data, engineering estimates, the operating history of 
the facility or vessel, or other relevant information to support 
notification. All supporting documents, materials, and other information 
shall be kept on file at the facility, or in the case of a vessel, at an 
office within the United States in either a port of call, a place of 
regular berthing, or the headquarters of the business operating the 
vessel. Supporting materials shall be kept on file for a period of one 
year and shall substantiate the reported normal range of releases, the 
basis for stating that the release is continuous and stable in quantity 
and rate, and the other information in the initial written report, the 
followup report, and the annual evaluations required under paragraphs 
(e), (f), and (i), respectively. Such information shall be made 
available to EPA upon request as necessary to enforce the requirements 
of this section.
    (l) Multiple concurrent releases. Multiple concurrent releases of 
the same substance occurring at various locations with respect to 
contiguous plants or installations upon contiguous grounds that are 
under common ownership or control may be considsred separately or added 
together in determining whether such releases constitute a continuous 
release or a statistically significant increase under the definitions in 
paragraph (b) of this section; whichever approach is elected for 
purposes of determining whether a release

[[Page 384]]

is continuous also must be used to determine a statistically significant 
increase in the release.
    (m) Penalties for failure to comply. The reduced reporting 
requirements provided for under this section shall apply only so long as 
the person in charge complies fully with all requirements of paragraph 
(c) of this section. Failure to comply with respect to any release from 
the facility or vessel shall subject the person in charge to all of the 
reporting requirements of Sec. 302.6 for each such release, to the 
penalties under Sec. 302.7, and to any other applicable penalties 
provided for by law.

                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 303.10  Purpose.

    This regulation implements the ``citizen award'' authority granted 
by Congress to the President in the 1986 Amendments to the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), 
section 109(d). As authorized in the Superfund Amendments and 
Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) section 109(c) and Executive Order 
No. 12580 (issued by the President on January 23, 1987), the 
Environmental Protection Agency is empowered to pay up to $10,000.00 
from the Superfund to any individual who provides information leading to 
the arrest and conviction of any person for a violation subject to a 
criminal penalty under CERCLA as amended.



<R05>
Sec. 303.11  Definitions.

    (a) Arrest. Restraint of an arrestee's liberty or the equivalent 
through the service of judicial process compelling such a person to 
respond to a criminal accusation.
    (b) Conviction. A judgment of guilt entered in U.S. District Court, 
upon a verdict rendered by the court or petit jury or by a plea of 
guilty, including a plea of nolo contendere.
    (c) Individual. A natural person, not a corporation or other legal 
entity nor an association of persons.



<R05>
Sec. 303.12  Criminal violations covered by this award authority.

    (a) Failure to Give Required Notice of a Release of a Reportable 
Quantity of a Hazardous Substance, 42 U.S.C. 9603(a);
    (b) Destruction or Concealment of Records Required under CERCLA to 
have been Retained, 42 U.S.C. 9603(d).


<R04>
 Subpart B--Eligibility to File a Claim for Award and Determination of 
                     Eligibility and Amount of Award


<R05>
Sec. 303.20  Eligibility to file a claim for award.

    (a) Any individual, except law enforcement officers and persons 
convicted in the case giving rise to the award claim and any persons 
identified in Sec. 303.20(b) shall be eligible to file a claim for an 
award as provided for in Sec. 303.33 of this subpart.
    (b) No person who was an employee of or contractor for the United 
States Environmental Protection Agency at the time he or she came into 
possession of the information disclosed to other Agency officials (or is 
so employed at

[[Page 385]]

the time of disclosure), which information constitutes in whole or part 
the basis for an award claim, shall be eligible to file a claim for an 
award.
    (c) To be eligible for an award, the informant must disclose the 
identity of person(s) [or other pertinent information that leads to the 
expeditious disclosure of the identity of said person(s)] criminally 
culpable for the violations set forth in Sec. 303.12 of subpart A. 
Disclosure of such pertinent information must be made to an employee, 
agent or representative of the United States Environmental Protection 
Agency.



<R05>
Sec. 303.21  Determination of eligibility and amount of award.

    The Agency's determinations as to eligibility and award amount shall 
constitute final Agency action as to either amount or eligibility. These 
determinations, consistent with the need to preserve from disclosure the 
identity of confidential informants (as noted in Sec. 303.31) as well as 
to preserve from disclosure methods of Agency investigation, shall not 
be subject to administrative challenge by any person not making a claim 
to that award.

    Note: It is the Environmental Protection Agency's view that such 
determinations also would not be subject to judicial challenge by such 
person.


<R04>
                Subpart C--Criteria for Payment of Award


<R05>
Sec. 303.30  Criteria for payment of award.

    Upon the filing of an eligible claim in accordance with the 
procedures as set forth in Sec. 303.33, the Agency's Assistant 
Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Monitoring, or his Deputy 
for Criminal Enforcement, in making the decision to grant an award, and 
if so, in what amount, shall consider all relevant criteria, giving such 
weight and importance to each separate criterion as appears warranted in 
his judgment alone. Relevant criteria include one or more of the 
following:
    (a) Whether the claimant's information constituted the initial, 
unsolicited notice to the Government of the violation;
    (b) Whether the Government would readily have obtained knowledge of 
the violation in a timely manner absent claimant's information;
    (c) Importance of the case, egregiousness of the violation, 
potential for or existence of environmental harm;
    (d) Concealment of a person criminally culpable or existence of an 
organized criminal conspiracy to conceal the offense(s) committed by the 
named defendant(s);
    (e) Willingness of the claimant to assist the Government's 
prosecution of the offense(s), which assistance includes providing 
further information and grand jury testimony, participating in trial 
preparation, and trial testimony if consistent with the limits on 
claimant identity disclosure as set forth in Sec. 303.31.
    (f) Value of the claimant's assistance in comparison to that given 
by all other sources of information and evidence which led to arrest and 
conviction.


<R05>
Sec. 303.31  Assurance of claimant confidentiality.

    No person, except as authorized by the Agency's Office of 
Enforcement and Compliance Monitoring to have this knowledge, shall be 
given access to the identity of, or information that would lead to the 
identity of, a claimant who has requested anonymity prior to disclosing 
information to the Agency.


<R05>
Sec. 303.32  Pre-payment offers.

    Prior to the actual payment of an award, no employee of the United 
States Government, including any person purporting to act on behalf of 
the United States Environmental Protection Agency, is authorized by 
these regulations to make any promise, offer, or representation with 
respect to the Agency's grant of an award in exchange for information.



<R05>
Sec. 303.33  Filing a claim.

    (a) Any individual seeking an award under this regulation is 
required to file a claim for such an award with the Deputy Assistant 
Administrator for Criminal Enforcement not later than 45 days after the 
conviction of the 

[[Page 386]]

person(s) involved in the prosecution in which the information was 
provided.
    (b) The claim submission must provide, at a minimum, a summary of 
the information provided, the date the information was provided, and the 
name and title of the person to whom the information was provided.
    (c) All claim submissions must be submitted to the Office of 
Criminal Enforcement Counsel (LE-134X), United States Environmental 
Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. The claim 
envelope should also specify whether the information was submitted under 
a request for anonymity and whether such request is still in effect. All 
such externally identified claims shall be handled in accordance with 
the Agency procedures for maintaining informant confidentiality, as 
referenced in Sec. 303.31 of this subpart.

<R04>
     Subpart B--Jurisdiction of Arbitrator, Referral of Claims, and 
                        Appointment of Arbitrator


<R05>
Sec. 304.20  Jurisdiction of Arbitrator.

    (a) In accordance with the procedures established by this part, the 
Arbitrator is authorized to arbitrate one or more issues arising in an 
EPA claim when:
    (1) The total past and projected response costs for the facility 
concerned

[[Page 388]]

do not exceed $500,000, excluding interest; and
    (2) The Administrator and one or more PRPs have submitted a joint 
request for arbitration pursuant to Sec. 304.21 of this part.
    (b)(1) If the total past and projected response costs for the 
facility concerned increase to a dollar amount in excess of $500,000, 
excluding interest, prior to the rendering of the final decision 
pursuant to Sec. 304.33 of this part, the parties may mutually agree to 
continue the proceeding as non-binding arbitration pursuant to the 
procedures established by this part, except that Secs. 304.33(e) and 
304.40 of this part shall not apply.
    (2) If all of the parties agree to continue the proceeding as non-
binding arbitration, the proposed decision rendered by the Arbitrator 
pursuant to Sec. 304.33 of this part shall not be binding upon the 
parties, unless all of the parties agree to adopt the proposed decision 
as an administrative settlement pursuant to section 122(h)(1) of CERCLA, 
42 U.S.C. 9622(h)(1). Any administrative settlement agreed upon in this 
manner shall be subject to the prior written approval of the Attorney 
General (or his designee) pursuant to section 122(h)(1) of CERCLA and 
shall be subject to public comment pursuant to section 122(i) of CERCLA, 
42 U.S.C. 9622(i).
    (3) If the parties do not agree to continue the proceeding as non-
binding arbitration, or if the administrative settlement agreed upon is 
not approved by the Attorney General (or his designee), or if EPA 
withdraws or withholds consent from the administrative settlement as a 
result of public comment, EPA shall withdraw from the proceeding and the 
Association shall assess or refund, as appropriate, any administrative 
fees, expenses, or Arbitrator's fees.
    (c) The Arbitrator's authority, as defined by paragraphs (d) and (e) 
of this section, to determine issues arising in EPA's claim is limited 
only to the issues submitted for resolution by the parties in the joint 
request for arbitration pursuant to Sec. 304.21 of this part. Any issues 
arising in EPA's claim that are not submitted for resolution shall be 
deemed to be not in dispute and shall not be raised in any action 
seeking enforcement of the decision for the purpose of overturning or 
otherwise challenging the final decision, except as provided in 
Sec. 304.40(c) of this part.
    (d)(1) If the issue of liability of any participating PRP has been 
submitted for resolution, the Arbitrator shall determine whether the 
participating PRP is liable pursuant to section 107(a) of CERCLA, 42 
U.S.C. 9607(a), subject only to the defenses specifically enumerated in 
section 107(b) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9607(b).
    (2) If the issue of the dollar amount of response costs recoverable 
by EPA has been submitted for resolution, the Arbitrator shall 
determine, pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, the dollar amount 
of response costs recoverable by EPA pursuant to section 107(a) of 
CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9607(a), and shall award the total amount of such 
costs to EPA.
    (3) Unless the Arbitrator finds that the actual or threatened harm 
at the facility is divisible, any participating PRP whom the Arbitrator 
determines to be liable shall be jointly and severally liable for the 
total amount of response costs awarded to EPA. If the Arbitrator finds 
that the actual or threatened harm is divisible, the Arbitrator shall 
allocate liability for payment of EPA's award among the participating 
PRPs based on the portion of the actual or threatened harm attributable 
to each participating PRP.
    (4) Notwithstanding the indivisibility of the actual or threatened 
harm, and without waiving the general applicability of the joint and 
several liability standard, as an alternative to paragraph (d)(3) of 
this section, the parties may request the Arbitrator to allocate 
responsibility for payment of response costs awarded to EPA among the 
participating PRPs whom the Arbitrator determines to be liable. Any such 
request shall be made in the joint request for arbitration pursuant to 
Sec. 304.21 of this part. If such a request is made, the provisions of 
paragraphs (d)(4)(i), (d)(4)(ii), and (d)(4)(iii) of this section shall 
apply.
    (i) The joint request for arbitration may specify the factors to be 
applied by the arbitrator when allocating among the participating PRPs 
responsibility for payment of the response

[[Page 389]]

costs awarded to EPA. If the joint request does not specify such 
factors, the Arbitrator shall base the allocation on such factors as the 
arbitrator considers relevant, in his or her sole discretion, such as 
volume, toxicity, and mobility of the hazardous substances contributed 
to the facility by each participating PRP, ability to pay, and 
inequities and aggravating factors.
    (ii) The joint request for arbitration may specify that the 
Arbitrator may allocate among the participating PRPs less than all 
response costs awarded to EPA. If this is not specified, the Arbitrator 
shall allocate among the participating PRPs 100% of the response costs 
awarded to EPA.
    (iii) The burden of establishing the appropriate allocation of 
responsibility for payment of the response costs awarded to EPA shall 
rest entirely with the participating PRPs.
    (5) The parties may request that the Arbitrator perform an 
allocation even if the issue of the liability of the participating PRPs 
is not submitted for resolution in the joint request for arbitration. 
Such a request for allocation shall be made in the joint request for 
arbitration pursuant to Sec. 304.21 of this part. If such a request is 
made, the provisions of paragraphs (d)(4)(i), (d)(4)(ii), and 
(d)(4)(iii) of this section shall apply.
    (e)(1) If any issue concerning the adequacy of EPA's response action 
has been submitted for resolution or arises during the Arbitrator's 
determination of the dollar amount of response costs recoverable by EPA, 
the Arbitrator shall uphold EPA's selection of the response action, 
unless any participating PRP can establish that the selection was 
inconsistent with the NCP. The Arbitrator's review of the adequacy of 
any response action taken by EPA shall be based upon the documents which 
formed the basis for the selection of the response action.
    (2) If the Arbitrator upholds EPA's selection of the response action 
in full, the Arbitrator shall award EPA all response costs incurred and 
to be incurred in connection with the response action, unless any 
participating PRP can establish that all or part of such costs were:
    (i) Not actually incurred or to be incurred; or
    (ii) Not actually incurred or to be incurred in connection with the 
response action; or
    (iii) Clearly excessive, taking into account the circumstances of 
the response action and relative to acceptable government procurement 
and contracting practices in light of the circumstances of the response 
action.
    (3) If the Arbitrator upholds EPA's selection of the response action 
only in part, the Arbitrator shall award EPA only those response costs 
incurred and to be incurred in connection with the portions of the 
response action that were upheld, unless any participating PRP can 
establish that all or part of such response costs were:
    (i) Not actually incurred or to be incurred; or
    (ii) Not actually incurred or to be incurred in connection with the 
portions of the response action that were upheld; or
    (iii) Clearly excessive, taking into account the circumstances of 
the response action and relative to acceptable government procurement 
and contracting practices in light of the circumstances of the response 
action.
    (4) The standard of review to be applied by the Arbitrator under 
paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), and (e)(3) of this section is arbitrary and 
capricious or otherwise not in accordance with law.
    (5) In reviewing any procedural errors alleged by any party, the 
Arbitrator may disallow response costs only if the errors were so 
serious and related to matters of such central relevance that the 
response action would have been significantly changed had such errors 
not been made.


<R05>
Sec. 304.21  Referral of claims.

    (a) If EPA believes that a claim is an appropriate candidate for 
arbitration, EPA will notify all identified PRPs for the facility 
concerned and provide such PRPs with an opportunity to discuss referral 
of one or more issues arising in the claim for resolution pursuant to 
the procedures established by this part. Alternatively, one or more PRPs 
at a facility may propose to EPA use of arbitration, after receipt of a 
demand by EPA for payment of a claim, but prior

[[Page 390]]

to commencement of civil litigation of the claim. Where practicable, 
before an agreement to refer a claim for arbitration is made final under 
this alternative, either the PRPs or EPA shall notify the other PRPs at 
the facility of the potential use of arbitration.
    (b)(1) The Administrator and one or more PRPs associated with a 
facility may submit to the Association a joint request for arbitration 
of one or more issues arising in an EPA claim concerning the facility. 
The joint request shall be signed by all of the parties and shall 
include:
    (i) A brief description of the facility, the EPA response action 
taken at the facility, the EPA claim, and the parties;
    (ii) A statement of the issues arising in the claim that are being 
submitted by the parties for resolution by arbitration;
    (iii) A statement that the parties consent to resolution of the 
issues jointly submitted pursuant to the procedures established by this 
part by an Arbitrator appointed pursuant to Sec. 304.22 of this part;
    (iv) A statement that the parties agree to be bound by the final 
decision on all issues jointly submitted by the parties for resolution 
and to pay any award made in the final decision, subject to the right to 
challenge the final decision solely on the grounds and in the manner 
prescribed by Sec. 304.40(c) of this part;
    (v) A statement that the parties agree that the award made in the 
final decision may be enforced pursuant to Sec. 304.40(c) of this part;
    (vi) A statement that the parties agree that the final decision 
shall be binding only with respect to the response costs at issue in the 
claim submitted for arbitration;
    (vii) A statement that the parties agree that the statute of 
limitations governing the EPA claim submitted shall be extended for a 
time period equal to the number of days from the date the joint request 
for arbitration is submitted to the Association to the date of 
resolution of any enforcement action relating to the final decision; and
    (viii) A statement that each signatory to the joint request is 
authorized to enter into the arbitration and to bind legally the party 
represented by him or her to the terms of the joint request.
    (2) The joint request shall also include the name, address and 
telephone number of each party, and, if a party is represented by an 
attorney, the attorney's name, address and telephone number. A party 
changing any of this information must promptly communicate the change in 
writing to the Association and all other parties. A party who fails to 
furnish such information or any changes thereto is deemed to have waived 
his or her right to notice and service under this part until such time 
as the party furnishes the missing information.
    (c) Any party may move to modify the joint request for arbitration 
to include one or more additional issues arising in the referred claim. 
To be effective, any such modification must be signed by the Arbitrator 
and all other parties. The joint request for arbitration may also be 
modified to add one or more additional parties, if such intervention is 
permitted by Sec. 304.24(a) of this part. To be effective, any such 
modification must be signed by the Arbitrator, the intervening party or 
parties, and all other parties.
    (d) The statute of limitations governing the EPA claim submitted for 
arbitration shall be extended for a time period equal to the number of 
days from the date the joint request for arbitration is submitted to the 
Association to the date of resolution of any enforcement action relating 
to the final decision.
    (e) Prior to the selection of the Association, the Administrator and 
one or more PRPs associated with a facility may agree to submit one or 
more issues arising in an EPA claim for resolution by arbitration. Any 
such agreement shall be contained in a joint request for arbitration 
which meets all requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. In any 
such arbitration, the arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to 
Sec. 304.22(e) of this part, and payment of all costs associated with 
the arbitration shall be made pursuant to Sec. 304.41(e) of this part. 
Arbitrations agreed upon pursuant to this paragraph

[[Page 391]]

shall be governed by the procedures established by this part, except for 
those procedures which pertain specifically to the duties of the 
Association. All duties of the Association shall be performed in a 
manner agreed upon by all of the parties.


<R05>
Sec. 304.22  Appointment of Arbitrator.

    (a) The Association shall establish and maintain a National Panel of 
Environmental Arbitrators.
    (b) Within ten days of the filing of the joint request for 
arbitration, the Association shall identify and submit simultaneously to 
all parties an indentical list of ten persons chosen from the National 
Panel of Environmental Arbitrators, whom the Association believes will 
not be subject to disqualification because of circumstances likely to 
affect impartiality pursuant to Sec. 304.23 of this part. Each party 
shall have ten days from the date of receipt of the list to identify any 
persons objected to, to rank the remaining persons in the order of 
preference, and to return the list to the Association. If a party does 
not return the list within the time specified, all persons on the list 
are deemed acceptable to that party. From among the persons whom the 
parties have indicated as acceptable, and, in accordance with the 
designated order of mutual preference, if any, the Association shall 
invite an Arbitrator to serve. If the parties fail to mutually agree 
upon any of the persons named, or if the invited Arbitrator is unable to 
serve, or if for any other reason the appointment cannot be made from 
the submitted lists, the Association shall make the appointment from 
among the other members of the Panel. In no event shall appointment of 
the Arbitrator by the Association take longer than thirty days from the 
filing of the joint request for arbitration.
    (c) Within seven days of the appointment of the Arbitrator, the 
Association shall mail to each of the parties notice of the identity of 
the Arbitrator and the date of the appointment, together with a copy of 
these rules. The Arbitrator shall, within five days of his or her 
appointment, file a signed acceptance of the case with the Association. 
The Association shall, within seven days of receipt of the Arbitrator's 
acceptance, mail notice of such acceptance to the parties.
    (d) If any appointed Arbitrator should resign, die, withdraw, be 
disqualified or otherwise be unable to perform the duties of the office, 
the Association may, on satisfactory proof, declare the office vacant. 
Vacancies shall be filled in accordance with the applicable provisions 
of this section, and the matter shall be resumed.
    (e) If the Administrator and one or more PRPs associated with a 
facility enter into a joint request for arbitration prior to the 
selection of the Association (see Sec. 304.21(e) of this part), the 
Administrator and the participating PRPs shall reach mutual agreement 
upon the selection and appointment of an Arbitrator on a case-by-case 
basis, and the Administrator shall obtain the services of that person 
using appropriate procurement procedures. Any person appointed as an 
Arbitrator pursuant to this paragraph shall make disclosures to the 
parties pursuant to Sec. 304.23 of this part, shall resolve the issues 
submitted for resolution pursuant to the jurisdiction and authority 
granted to the Arbitrator in Sec. 304.20 of this part, and shall

Association receives any such request, and shall notify the parties in 
writing of such determination. This determination shall be within the 
sole discretion of the Association, and its decision shall be final.

(see Sec. 304.31 of this part), any PRP associated with the facility 
which is the subject of the referred claim may move to intervene in the 
arbitral proceeding for the purpose of having one or more issues 
relating to his or her responsibility for payment of the referred claim 
resolved.
    (2) If the Arbitrator has been appointed, a motion to intervene 
shall be filed with the Arbitrator and a copy shall be served upon all 
parties. If the Arbitrator has not yet been appointed, a motion to

written approval of the Arbitrator and all of the parties in the form of 
a modification to the joint request for arbitration pursuant to 
Sec. 304.21(c) of this part. by signing such a modification, the 
intervening party consents to be bound by the terms of the joint request 
for arbitration submitted pursuant to Sec. 304.21(b) of this part and 
any modifications previously made thereto pursuant to Sec. 304.21(c) of 
this part, and consents to be bound by such revisions to the time limits

delaying the pre-hearing conference.
    (b) Any party may move to withdraw from the arbitral proceeding 
within thirty days after receipt of the notice of appointment of the 
Arbitrator (see Sec. 304.22 of this part). The Arbitrator may approve 
such withdrawal, without prejudice to the moving party, and shall assess 
such administrative fees and expenses (see Sec. 304.41 of this part) 
against the withdrawing party as the Arbitrator deems appropriate. No 
party may withdraw from the arbitral proceedings after this thirty-day 
period, except that EPA may withdraw from the proceeding in accordance

prejudice of any party. If the Arbitrator is removed, the procedures in 
Sec. 304.22(d) of this part shall apply.
    (d) Whenever an ex parte communication in violation of this section 
is received by or made known to the Arbitrator, the Arbitrator shall 
immediately notify in writing all parties to the proceeding of the 
circumstances and substance of the communication and may require the 
party who made the communication or caused the communication to be made, 
or the party whose representative made the communication or caused the 
communication to be made, to show cause why that party's arguments or 
claim should not be denied, disregarded, or otherwise adversely affected 
on account of such violation.
    (e) The prohibitions of this section apply upon appointment of the 
Arbitrator and terminate on the date of the final decision.

    (a) The Arbitrator shall render a proposed decision within forty-
five days after the hearing is closed, or within forty-five days after

    (b)(1) The proposed decision shall be in writing and shall be signed 
by the Arbitrator. It shall be limited in accordance with the 
Arbitrator's jurisdiction as defined by Sec. 304.20 of this part, and 
shall, if such issues have been jointly submitted by the parties for 
resolution, contain the Arbitrator's determination of:
    (i) Which participating PRPs, if any, are liable pursuant to section 
107(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9607(a);
    (ii) The dollar amount of response costs, if any, to be awarded to 
EPA; and
    (iii) The allocation of responsibility for payment of EPA's award, 
if any, among the participating PRPs.
    (2) The proposed decision shall also assess arbitration fees and

combination of parties, and, in the event any administrative fees or 
expenses are due the Association, in favor of the Association.
    (c) If the parties settle their dispute during the course of the 
proceeding, the Arbitrator may, upon the parties' request, set forth in 
the terms of the agreed settlement in a proposed decision. Except as 
provided in Sec. 304.20(b) of this part, a proposed decision which

    (e)(1) Pursuant to section 122(i) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622(i), 
notice of the proposed decision shall be published

[[Page 397]]

promptly by EPA in the Federal Register. Such notice shall include the 
name and location of the facility concerned, the names of the parties to 
the proceeding, and a brief summary of the proposed decision, and shall 
provide persons who are not parties to the proceeding a thirty-day 
period in which to file written comments relating to the proposed 
decision. Any filed comments shall be made available to the 
participating PRPs and to the public. The participating PRPs shall have 
ten days from the close of the public comment period in which to submit 
to EPA in writing their views on the merits of any comments filed. EPA 
shall consider any comments filed, and shall, within thirty days after 
the close of the ten-day period during which the participating PRPs may 
submit their views on any comments filed, provide written notice to the 
Arbitrator and the participating PRPs. The written notice shall be made 
available to the public and shall include:
    (i) A summary of any comments filed;
    (ii) Responses to any comments filed;
    (iii) A discussion of whether any comments filed disclose to EPA 
facts or considerations which indicate the proposed decision is 
inappropriate, improper or inadequate; and

decision or withdrawal from the arbitral proceeding is necessary based 
upon such comments.
    (2) If EPA's written notice does not state that modification or 
withdrawal is necessary based upon public comments, then the proposed 
decision shall become final thirty days after the date of issuance of 
EPA's written notice. If EPA's written notice states that modification 
or withdrawal is necessary, the parties shall have thirty days from the 
date of issuance of EPA's written notice to modify the proposed decision 
so that it is no longer inappropriate, improper or inadequate and to set 
forth the proposed decision, as modified, in an agreed settlement. If an 
agreed settlement is reached, such agreed settlement shall be the final 
decision. If the parties do not modify the proposed decision in an 
agreed settlement within thirty days, the proposed decision shall be 
null and void and of no legal effect, EPA shall withdraw from the 
proceeding, and the Arbitrator shall assess such administrative fees and 
expenses (see Sec. 304.41 of this part) against the parties as the 
Arbitrator deems appropriate.

to such party certified facsimiles of all papers in the Arbitrator's 
possession that may be required in judicial proceedings relating to the 
arbitration pursuant to Sec. 304.40 of this part.

Sec. 305.4  Powers and duties of the Review Officer and the Presiding Officer; disqualification.

    (a)  Review Officer. The Review Officer is authorized to receive 
Requests for a Hearing; attempt to promote settlement; make the decision 
of the Agency on the claim if the claimant does not request referral of 
the Request for a Hearing to the Chief Administrative Law Judge; and 
refer a Request for a Hearing to the Chief Administrative Law Judge when 
necessary. The Review Officer shall make the decision of the Agency on 
the claim in writing and shall serve the Requestor and the Claims 
Official with a copy of his decision. The Review Officer may, sua 
sponte, without ruling on the merits of the Request for a Hearing, refer 
it to the Chief Adminstrative Law Judge for decision. If the Requestor 
is not satisfied with the decision of the Review Officer, he may, within 
10 days of service of such decision, request that the Review Officer 
refer the Request for a Hearing to the Chief Administrative Law Judge. 
The Requestor shall also serve such notice on the Claims Official. 
Otherwise the decision of the Review Officer is a final order. When 
referring a matter to the Chief Administrative Law Judge, the Review 
Officer shall include the Request for a Hearing, a copy of his decision, 
and any other pertinent documents. The Review Officer also shall notify 
the Requestor, the Hearing Clerk, and the Claims Official when he refers 
a Request for a Hearing to the Chief Administrative Law Judge. The 
Hearing Clerk, shall, upon receipt of the relevant documents, establish 
a file for the hearing. Thereafter, a copy of all pleadings must be 
filed with the Hearing Clerk. This requirement is in addition to the 
applicable service of documentation requirements contained in 
Sec. 305.5(b)(2). The Review Officer shall exercise all other powers and 
duties prescribed or delegated to him under the Act or this part.
    (b) Presiding Officer. Upon receipt from the Review Officer of the 
Request for a Hearing, the Chief Administrative Law Judge shall 
designate himself or another Administrative Law Judge as Presiding 
Officer and shall transmit all documents related to the Request for a 
Hearing to the Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer shall then 
notify the parties of his assignment pursuant to Sec. 305.4(c). The 
Presiding Officer shall conduct a fair and impartial proceeding, assure 
that the facts are fully elicited, adjudicate all issues, and avoid 
delay. The Presiding Officer shall have authority to:
    (1) Conduct administrative hearings under this part;
    (2) Rule upon motions, requests, and offers of proof, dispose of 
procedural requests, and issue all necessary orders;
    (3) Administer oaths and affirmations;
    (4) Examine witnesses and receive documentary or other evidence;

[[Page 402]]

    (5) Order a party, or an officer or agent thereof, for good cause, 
upon motion, or sua sponte, to produce testimony, documents, or other 
nonprivileged evidence, and failing the production thereof without good 
cause being shown, draw adverse inferences against that party;
    (6) Admit or exclude evidence;
    (7) Hear and decide questions of law and fact;
    (8) Require parties to attend conferences for the settlement or 
simplification of the issues, or the expedition of the proceedings;
    (9) Extend the time limit for a final order in the hearing for a 
period not to exceed 60 days;
    (10) Render findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a final order;
    (11) Assess costs of the proceeding pursuant to Sec. 305.36(b);
    (12) Do all other acts and take all measures necessary for the 
maintenance of order and for the efficient and impartial adjudication of 
issues arising in proceedings governed by this part; and
    (13) Resolve all disputes based on the evidence and applicable law; 
see Sec. 305.31 concerning evidence.
    (c) The Presiding Officer shall notify the parties that the Request 
for a Hearing has been assigned to him, and that he has received the 
case file from the Chief Administrative Law Judge. After ruling on any 
objections to jurisdiction, or final disposition of any objections to 
disqualification, the Presiding Officer shall render a final order 
within 90 days after he affirmatively accepts such jurisdiction. The 
Presiding Officer shall render a final order within the allotted time, 
unless all parties agree in writing to an extension, or unless, in his 
discretion, either upon motion of a party or sua sponte, he allows an 
extension of time not to exceed 60 days. If all parties agree in writing 
to an extension of the time period within which the Presiding Officer 
must issue a final order, the extension shall be for the period agreed 
to in writing by all parties. There are no limits to such periods other 
than that to which the parties have agreed in writing. An agreement by 
the parties to extend the time limit does not preclude the Presiding 
Officer from extending the time limit to issue a final order sua sponte 
or upon motion of a party, nor does an extension by the Presiding 
Officer preclude the parties from agreeing to an extension.
    (d) Disqualification; withdrawal. (1) Neither the Review Officer nor 
the Presiding Officer may perform functions provided for in this part 
regarding any matter in which he: has a financial interest; or has any 
relationship with a party or with the subject matter that would make it 
inappropriate for him to act. A party shall, by motion presented within 
5 days after receiving notice of the assignment of the Presiding 
Officer, make any objection to his assignment. Otherwise, any objections 
to the qualifications of the Presiding Officer are waived, unless such 
objections arise after the time for presenting objections allowed by 
this paragraph. In such case, any objection must be made within 5 days 
of the time within which it arose. Either party may appeal the Presiding 
Officer's ruling on a motion to disqualify him to the Chief 
Administrative Law Judge. The Chief Administrative Law Judge shall rule 
on such motion in a timely fashion. When the Chief Administrative Law 
Judge is the Presiding Officer, he shall refer any challenge to his 
qualification to hear the case to another Administrative Law Judge for 
decision. The Review Officer or the Presiding Officer may at any time 
withdraw from any proceeding in which he deems himself disqualified or 
unable to act for any reason.
    (2) If the Review Officer or the Presiding Officer is disqualified 
or withdraws from the proceeding, a qualified individual who has none of 
the infirmities listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be 
assigned to replace him. The Administrator shall appoint a new Review 
Officer. The Chief Administrative Law Judge shall assign a new Presiding 
Officer from among the available Administrative Law Judges.
    (3) The Chief Administrative Law Judge shall have the power to rule 
on motions for disqualification as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section and may, at any stage in the hearing, reassign the case to an 
Administrative Law Judge other than the one originally assigned in the 
event of the unavailability of the Administrative

[[Page 403]]

Law Judge or where reassignment will result in efficiency in the 
scheduling of hearings and will not prejudice the parties.

a party may only be made after notice to all other parties, unless the 
movant can show good cause why serving notice is impracticable. The 
motion shall be filed in advance of the date on which the pleading, 
document or motion is due to be filed, unless the failure of a party to 
make timely motion for extension of time was the result of excusable 
neglect.
    (c) Service by mail. Service of the Request for a Hearing is 
complete when the return receipt is signed by the Review Officer. 
Service of all other pleadings and documents is complete upon mailing. 
Where a pleading or document is served by mail, 5 days shall be added to

document.


<R05>
Sec. 305.7  Ex parte discussion of proceeding.

Presiding Officer shall the Presiding Officer discuss ex parte the 
merits of the proceeding with any interested person outside the Agency, 
with any Agency staff member who performed a prosecutorial or 
investigative function in such proceeding or a factually related 
proceeding, or with any representative of such person. Any ex parte 
memorandum or other communication addressed to the Presiding Officer 
during the pendency of the proceeding and relating to the merits

<R05>
Sec. 305.21  Amendment of request for a hearing; withdrawal.

    (a) Amendment of Request for a Hearing. The Requestor may amend the 
Request for a Hearing once as a matter of right at any time before the 
answer is filed. Otherwise the Requestor may amend the Request for a 
Hearing only upon motion granted by the Presiding Officer. The Claims 
Official shall have 10 additional days from the date of service of the 
amended claim to file his answer.
    (b) Withdrawal of Request for a Hearing. The Requestor may withdraw 
the Request for a Hearing, or any part thereof, without prejudice one 
time before the answer has been filed. After one withdrawal without 
prejudice before the filing of an answer, or after the filing of an 
answer, the Requestor may withdraw the Request for a Hearing, or any 
part thereof, without prejudice, only upon motion granted by the 
Presiding Officer. In no case may a Request for a Hearing be filed more 
than 30 days after the Requestor has received notice that the Claims 
Official has declined to pay all or part of a claim.


<R05>
Sec. 305.22  Answer to the request for a hearing.

    (a) General. The Claims Official shall file an original and one copy 
of a written answer to the Request for a Hearing with the Hearing Clerk 
when he: contests any material fact upon which the Request for a Hearing 
is based; contends that the amount of money demanded in the Request for 
a Hearing is inappropriate; or contends that he is entitled to judgment 
as a matter of law. Any such answer to the Request for a Hearing must be 
filed with the Hearing Clerk and served on all parties within 15 days 
after the Presiding Officer has assumed jurisdiction over the case as 
provided by Sec. 305.4(d).
    (b) Contents of the answer. The answer shall clearly and directly 
admit, deny, or explain each of the factual allegations in the Request 
for a Hearing with regard to which the Claims Official has any 
knowledge. When the Claims Official has no knowledge of a particular 
allegation and so states, the allegation is deemed denied. The answer 
shall also state:
    (1) The circumstances or arguments which are alleged to constitute 
the grounds of defense; and
    (2) The facts which the Claims Official intends to place at issue.
    (c) Failure to admit, deny, or explain. Failure of the Claims 
Official to admit, deny or explain any material factual allegation 
contained in the claim constitutes an admission of the allegation.
    (d) Amendment of the answer. The Claims Official may amend the 
answer to the Request for a Hearing upon motion granted by the Presiding 
Officer.


<R05>
Sec. 305.23  Motions.

    (a) General. All motions, except those made orally on the record 
during a hearing, shall: be in writing; state the grounds therefor with 
particularity; set forth the relief sought and a proposed order; and be 
accompanied by an affidavit, certificate, other evidence, or legal 
memorandum relied upon. Such motions shall be served as provided by 
Sec. 305.5(b)(2)(i).
    (b) Response to motions. A party's response to any written motion 
must be filed within 10 days after service of such motion, unless 
additional time is allowed for such response. The response shall be 
accompanied by any affidavit, certificate, other evidence or legal 
memorandum relied upon. If no response is filed within the designated 
period, the parties may be deemed to

[[Page 407]]

have waived any objection to the granting of the motion. The Presiding 
Officer may set a shorter time for response, or make such other orders 
concerning the disposition of motions as he deems appropriate.
    (c) Decision. The Presiding Officer, or Chief Administrative Law 
Judge, in the absence of a Presiding Officer, shall rule on all motions. 
Oral argument on motions will be permitted in the discretion of the 
Presiding Officer. See Sec. 305.4(a) concerning motions to extend the 
time limit for final orders.


<R05>
Sec. 305.24  Default order.

    (a) Default. A party may be found to be in default: after motion, 
upon failure of the Claims Official to file a timely answer to the 
Request for a Hearing; after motion or sua sponte, upon failure to 
comply with a prehearing or hearing order of the Presiding Officer; or 
after motion or sua sponte, upon failure to appear at a conference or 
hearing without good cause being shown. No finding of default on the 
basis of failure to appear at a hearing shall be made against the Claims 
Official unless the Requestor presents sufficient evidence to the 
Presiding Officer to establish a prima facie case in support of his 
claim. Any motion for a default order shall include a proposed default 
order and shall be served upon all parties. The alleged defaulting party 
shall have 10 days from service to reply to the motion. Default by the 
Claims Official constitutes, for purposes of the pending action only, an 
admission of all facts alleged in the claim and a waiver of his right to 
a hearing on such factual allegations. Default by the Requestor may 
result in the dismissal of the Request for a Hearing with prejudice.
    (b) Procedures upon default. When the Presiding Officer finds a 
default has occurred, he shall issue a default order against the 
defaulting party. The default order shall constitute the final order in 
the proceeding, and shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk.
    (c) Contents of a default order. A default order shall include 
findings of fact showing the grounds for the order; conclusions 
regarding all material issues of law; costs to be assessed pursuant to 
Sec. 305.36, if applicable; and, the amount to be awarded the claimant, 
if any.
    (d) Setting aside a default order. For good cause shown, the 
Presiding Officer may set aside a default order.


<R05>
Sec. 305.25  Informal settlement; voluntary agreement.

    (a) Settlement policy. The Agency encourages settlement of a 
proceeding at any time if the settlement is consistent with the 
provisions and objectives of the Act and applicable regulations. 
Settlement conferences shall not affect the Claims Official's obligation 
to file a timely answer under Sec. 305.22.
    (b) Voluntary agreement. The voluntary agreement shall state that, 
for the purpose of this proceeding, the Claims Official consents to the 
award of a sum certain to the Requestor or in the case of no award, that 
both parties agree to settle the matter. The voluntary agreement shall 
include an order acceptable to both the Requestor and EPA, and shall be 
signed by all parties or their counsel or representatives. A voluntary 
agreement is effective without approval of the Presiding Officer and is 
a final order as defined in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 305.26  Prehearing conference.

    (a) Purpose of prehearing conference. Unless a conference appears 
unnecessary, the Presiding Officer, at any time before the hearing 
begins, shall direct the parties and their counsel or other 
representatives to appear at a conference before him to consider:
    (1) The settlement of the case;
    (2) The simplification of issues and stipulation of facts not in 
dispute;
    (3) The necessity or desirability of amendments to the pleadings;
    (4) The exchange of exhibits, documents, prepared testimony, and 
admissions or stipulations of fact which will avoid unnecessary proof;
    (5) The limitation of the number of expert or other witnesses;
    (6) Setting a time and place for the hearing; and
    (7) Any other matters which may expedite the disposition of the 
proceeding.
    (b) Exchange of witness lists and documents. Unless otherwise 
ordered by the Presiding Officer, each party at the

[[Page 408]]

prehearing conference shall make available to all other parties: the 
names of the expert and other witnesses he intends to call, together 
with a brief narrative summary of their expected testimony; and copies 
of all documents and exhibits which each party intends to introduce into 
evidence. Documents and exhibits shall be marked for identification as 
ordered by the Presiding Officer. Documents that have not been exchanged 
and witnesses whose names have not been exchanged shall not be 
introduced into evidence or allowed to testify without permission of the 
Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer shall allow the parties 
reasonable opportunity to review new evidence.
    (c) Record of the prehearing conference. No transcript of a 
prehearing conference relating to settlement shall be made. With respect 
to other prehearing conferences, no transcript of any prehearing 
conferences shall be made unless ordered by the Presiding Officer upon 
motion of a party or sua sponte. The Presiding Officer shall prepare and 
file for the record a written summary of the action taken at the 
conference and shall serve that summary on all parties in the manner 
provided in Sec. 305.5(b)(2). The summary shall incorporate any written 
stipulations or agreements of the parties and all rulings and 
appropriate orders containing directions to the parties.
    (d) Location of the prehearing conference. The prehearing conference 
shall be held in the county where the release occurred, in the city in 
which the EPA Regional Office is located (in the Region where the 
release or threat of release occurred), or in Washington, DC, unless the 
Presiding Officer determines that there is good cause to hold it at 
another location or by telephone.
    (e) Unavailability of a prehearing conference. If a prehearing 
conference is unnecessary or impracticable, the Presiding Officer, on 
motion or sua sponte, may direct the parties to correspond with him to 
accomplish any of the objectives set forth in this section.
    (f) Other discovery. (1) Discovery shall include any of the methods 
described in rule 26(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
    (2) The parties may conduct any mutually agreed upon discovery 
without participation or determination of the Presiding Officer except 
that such voluntary discovery may be subject to such time limitations as 
the Presiding Officer deems appropriate.
    (3) Except as provided by paragraphs (b) and (f)(2) of this section, 
further discovery, under this section, shall be permitted only pursuant 
to order of the Presiding Officer. Any party to the proceeding desiring 
an order of discovery shall make a motion therefore. Such motion shall 
set forth:
    (i) The circumstances warranting the discovery;
    (ii) The nature of the information expected to be discovered; and
    (iii) The method of discovery sought, including, where relevant, the 
proposed time and place where the discovery will be conducted.
    (4) The Presiding Officer shall issue an order for discovery only 
upon a showing of good cause and upon a determination:
    (i) That such discovery will not in any way unreasonably delay the 
proceeding;
    (ii) That the information to be obtained is not otherwise 
obtainable; and
    (iii) That such information has significant probative value.
If the Presiding Officer determines that the motion should be granted, 
he shall issue an order for such discovery together with the conditions 
and terms thereof.
    (5) The Presiding Officer shall order depositions upon oral 
questions only upon a finding that:
    (i) The information sought cannot be obtained by alternative methods 
of discovery; or
    (ii) There is a substantial reason to believe that relevant and 
probative evidence may otherwise not be preserved for presentation by a 
witness at the hearing.
    (6) When the information sought to be obtained is within the control 
of one of the parties, failure to comply with an order issued pursuant 
to this paragraph may lead to:
    (i) The inference that the information to be discovered would be 
adverse to the party from whom the information was sought; or

[[Page 409]]

    (ii) The issuance of a default order under Sec. 305.24(a).
    (g) Interpreters. The Presiding Officer shall make the necessary 
arrangements for the services of an interpreter upon the motion of a 
party or sua sponte. The cost of the interpreter shall normally be borne 
by the party requesting the service, but the Presiding Officer may 
apportion the cost among the parties as justice demands.


<R05>
Sec. 305.27  Accelerated order, order to dismiss.

    (a) General. The Presiding Officer, upon motion of any party or sua 
sponte, may at any time render an accelerated order in favor of the 
Requestor or the Claims Official as to all or any part of the 
proceeding, without further hearing or upon such limited additional 
evidence, such as affidavits, as he may require, if no genuine issue of 
material fact exists and the party is entitled to judgment as a matter 
of law, as to all or any part of the proceeding. In addition, the 
Presiding Officer, upon motion of the Claims Official, may at any time 
dismiss a Request for a Hearing without further hearing or upon such 
limited additional evidence as he requires, on the basis of failure to 
establish a prima facie case or other grounds which show no right to 
relief on the part of the Requestor.
    (b) Effect. (1) If an accelerated order or an order to dismiss is 
issued as to all the issues in the proceeding, the order constitutes the 
final order of the Presiding Officer, and shall be filed with the 
Hearing Clerk.
    (2) If an accelerated order or an order to dismiss is rendered on 
less than all issues in the proceeding, the Presiding Officer shall 
determine what material facts exist without substantial controversy and 
what material facts remain controverted in good faith. He shall 
thereupon issue an interlocutory order specifying the facts which appear 
substantially uncontroverted, and the issues upon which the hearing will 
proceed.


<R04>
                      Subpart D--Hearing Procedure


<R05>
Sec. 305.30  Scheduling the hearing.

    (a) Filing of answer. When an answer is filed, the Hearing Clerk 
shall forward such answer to the Presiding Officer.
    (b) Notice of hearing. The Presiding Officer shall serve upon the 
parties a notice of hearing setting forth a time and place for the 
hearing. The Presiding Officer may issue the notice of hearing at any 
appropriate time, but not later than 20 days prior to the date set for 
the hearing.
    (c) Postponement of hearing. No request for postponement of a 
hearing shall be granted except upon motion and for good cause shown.
    (d) Location of the hearing. The location of the hearing shall be 
determined in accordance with the method of determining the location of 
a prehearing conference under Sec. 305.26(d).


<R05>
Sec. 305.31  Evidence.

    (a) General. The Presiding Officer shall admit all evidence which is 
not irrelevant, immaterial, unduly repetitious, or otherwise unreliable 
or of little probative value, except that evidence which would be 
excluded in the Federal courts under Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of 
Evidence (28 U.S.C. appendix) is not admissible. In the presentation, 
admission, disposition, and use of evidence, the Presiding Officer shall 
follow the provisions regarding confidential business information of 40 
CFR part 2, subpart B for CERCLA. The commercial or trade secret status 
of any information shall not, however, preclude its being introduced 
into evidence. The Presiding Officer may make such orders as may be 
necessary to consider such evidence in camera, including the preparation 
of a supplemental final order to address questions of law or fact which 
arise out of that portion of the evidence which is confidential or which 
includes trade secrets. For the purpose of recording the hearing, the 
court reporter shall be considered ``a person under contract or 
subcontract to EPA to perform work for EPA in connection with the Act or 
regulations which implement the Act'' pursuant to 40 CFR 2.301(h)(2); 
unless the affected business, as defined in 40 CFR 2.201(d), agrees to 
some other procedures approved by the Presiding Officer.
    (b) Examination of witnesses. Witnesses shall be examined orally, 
under

[[Page 410]]

oath or affirmation, except as otherwise provided in this part or by the 
Presiding Officer. A party shall have the right to cross-examine a 
witness who appears at the hearing provided that such cross-examination 
is not unduly repetitious.
    (c) Verified statements. The Presiding Officer may admit and insert 
into the record as evidence, in lieu of oral testimony, statements of 
fact or opinions prepared by a witness. The admissibility of the 
evidence contained in the statement shall be subject to the same rules 
as if the testimony were produced under oral examination. Before any 
such statement is read or admitted into evidence, the witness shall 
deliver a copy of the statement to the Presiding Officer, the reporter, 
and opposing counsel. The witness presenting the statement shall swear 
to or affirm the statement and shall be subject to appropriate oral 
cross-examination upon the contents thereof.
    (d) Admission of affidavits and other statements where the witness 
is unavailable. The Presiding Officer may admit into evidence affidavits 
and other verified written statements of witnesses who are unavailable. 
The term ``unavailable'' shall have the meaning accorded to it by rule 
804(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.
    (e) Exhibits. Where practicable, an original and one copy of each 
exhibit shall be filed with the Presiding Officer for the record and 
copy shall be furnished to each party. A true copy of any exhibit may be 
substituted for the original.
    (f) Official notice. Official notice may be taken of any matter 
which may be judicially noticed in the Federal courts and of other facts 
within the specialized knowledge and experience of the Agency. Opposing 
parties shall be given adequate opportunity to show that such facts are 
erroneously noticed.


<R05>
Sec. 305.32  Objections and offers of proof.

    (a) Objection. Any objection concerning the conduct of the hearing 
may be stated orally or in writing during the hearing. The party raising 
the objection must supply a short statement of its grounds. The ruling 
by the Presiding Officer on any objection and the reasons given for it 
shall be part of the record. An exception to each objection overruled 
shall be automatic and is not waived by further participation in the 
hearing.
    (b) Offer of proof. Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, 
the party offering the evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall 
be included in the record. The offer of proof for excluded oral 
testimony shall consist of a brief statement describing the nature of 
the evidence excluded. The offer of proof for excluded documents or 
exhibits shall consist of the insertion into the record of the documents 
or exhibits excluded.


<R05>
Sec. 305.33  Burden of presentation; burden of persuasion.

    The Requestor has the burden of going forward with his case and of 
proving that the amount demanded in the Request for a Hearing is 
justified. Accordingly, the Requestor bears the burdens of presentation 
and persuasion. Following the establishment of a prima facie case, the 
Claims Official shall have the burden of presenting and of going forward 
with any defense to the allegations set forth in the Request for a 
Hearing. Each matter of controversy shall be determined by the Presiding 
Officer upon a preponderance of the evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 305.34  Filing the transcript.

    The hearing shall be transcribed verbatim. Promptly following the 
taking of the last evidence, the reporter shall transmit to the Hearing 
Clerk the original and as many copies of the transcript of testimony as 
are called for in the reporter's contract with the Agency, and also 
shall transmit to the Presiding Officer a copy of the transcript. A 
certificate of service shall accompany each copy of the transcript. The 
Hearing Clerk shall notify all the parties of the availability of the 
transcript and shall furnish the Requestor with a copy of the transcript 
upon payment of the cost of reproduction, unless a Requestor can show 
that the cost is unduly burdensome. Any person not a party to the 
proceeding may receive a copy of the transcript upon payment of the 
reproduction fee, except for those parts of the transcript ordered to be 
kept confidential by the Presiding

[[Page 411]]

Officer. Any party may file a motion to correct the transcript in 
accordance with the provision of Sec. 305.23.


<R05>
Sec. 305.35  Proposed findings, conclusions, and order.

    Within 20 days after the parties are notified of the availability of 
the transcript, any party may submit for the consideration of the 
Presiding Officer proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a 
proposed order, together with briefs in support thereof. The Presiding 
Officer shall set a time by which reply briefs may be submitted. The 
Presiding Officer may by order extend the time or change the schedule of 
such submissions or allow further submissions as may be appropriate. All 
submissions shall be in writing, shall be served upon all parties, and 
shall contain references to the record for all proposed findings of fact 
and appropriate citations for authorities relied upon.


<R05>
Sec. 305.36  Final order; costs.

    (a)  Filing and content. The Presiding Officer shall issue and file 
with the Hearing Clerk a final order as soon as practicable after the 
period for filing reply briefs under Sec. 305.35 has expired, but within 
the time allowed for issuance of a final order as prescribed by 
Sec. 305.4(d). The final order shall contain his findings of fact, 
conclusions of law, as well as the reasons therefor, and an order for an 
award for a sum certain, or an explanation of why no award is granted.
    (b) Costs. If the Presiding Officer concludes in writing that the 
Request for a Hearing was frivolous, he may direct the Hearing Clerk to 
assess all or part of the costs of the proceeding against the Requestor. 
In such case, the Hearing Clerk shall assess such costs as directed by 
the Presiding Officer, and shall serve notice of such direction and the 
amount of such costs on all parties. No later than 5 days after receipt 
of notice of assessment of costs, the Requestor may move that the 
Presiding Officer review the assessment of costs by the Hearing Clerk. 
The Presiding Officer may uphold, reverse, or modify the action of the 
Hearing Clerk in assessing costs.

<R04>
                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 307.10   Purpose.

    This part prescribes the appropriate forms and procedures for 
presenting claims for necessary response costs as authorized by section 
112(b)(1) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and 
Liability Act of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and 
Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) (herein referred to as CERCLA, or the 
Act) (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.). Such claims may be presented to the 
Hazardous Substance Superfund (the Fund) established by section 9507 of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. See section 101(11) of CERCLA.


<R05>
Sec. 307.11  Scope and applicability.

    (a) The following may be submitted only through the procedures 
established by this part: claims for responses to a release or 
substantial threat of release of a hazardous substance into the 
environment; claims for responses to a release or substantial threat of 
release of any pollutants or contaminants into the environment, which 
may present an imminent and substantial danger to public health or 
welfare; and claims for response actions undertaken pursuant to 
settlement agreements in which the Federal Government agrees to 
reimburse a portion of the cost. Under this part, persons may bring 
claims for necessary costs incurred in carrying out the National 
Contingency Plan (NCP) (40 CFR part 300) developed under section 311(c) 
of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) and 
revised pursuant to section 105 of CERCLA. Only response actions that 
EPA has preauthorized are eligible for reimbursement through the claims 
process of section 112 of CERCLA. Authority for the payment of claims 
for response costs is provided by section 111(a)(2) of CERCLA. Authority 
for the reimbursement of certain costs incurred by parties to a 
settlement agreement entered pursuant to section 122 of CERCLA is 
provided by section 122(b) of CERCLA.
    (b) This part does not affect the terms and conditions contained in 
Preauthorization Decision Documents (PDDs) issued prior to the effective 
date of this part. However, a potential claimant may elect to comply 
with the provisions of this part, rather than the terms and conditions 
of a PDD issued prior to the effective date of this part, if he so 
chooses. Written notice of this election must be provided to EPA by the 
potential claimant prior to such provision taking effect, but not later 
than the time of the submittal of any claim to EPA. EPA will provide a 
written acknowledgement of the potential claimant's election and may 
revise the PDD as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 307.12  Use of number and gender.

    As used in this part, words in the singular also include the plural 
and vice versa, and words in the masculine gender also include the 
feminine, as the case may require.

    (2) Reasonable (nature and amount do not exceed that estimated or 
which would be incurred by a prudent person);
    (3) Allocable (incurred specifically for the site at issue); and
    (4) Otherwise allowable (consistent with the limitations and

mitigates a release, threat of release, or pathway of exposure. The 
cleanup of a site can be divided into a number of operable units, 
depending on the complexity of the problems associated with the site. 
Operable units may address geographical portions of a site, specific 
site problems, or initial phases of an action, or may consist of any set 
of actions performed over time or any actions that are concurrent but 
located in different parts of a site. Operable units will not impede 
implementation of subsequent actions, including final action at the 
site.
    Party means EPA or a claimant.

mutation, physiological malfunctions (including malfunctions in 
reproduction) or physical deformations in such organisms or their 
offspring. The term does not include petroleum, including crude oil and 
any fraction thereof which is not otherwise specifically listed or 
designated as a hazardous substance under section 101(14)(A) through (F) 
of the Act, nor does it include natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or 
synthetic gas of pipeline quality (or mixtures of natural gas and such 
synthetic gas).
    Preauthorization means EPA's prior approval to submit a claim 
against the Fund for necessary response costs incurred as a result of 
carrying out the NCP. The process of preauthorization consists of three 
steps:
    (1) EPA's receipt of the application for preauthorization;
    (2) EPA's review and analysis of the application; and
    (3) EPA's issuance of the Preauthorization Decision Document, which 
sets forth the terms and conditions for reimbursement.
    Preauthorized response actions are response actions approved through 
the preauthorization process.

    Subpart B--Eligible Claimants; Allowable Claims; Preauthorization


<R05>
Sec. 307.20  Who may present claims.

    (a) Subject to the provisions of this subpart, claims for the costs 
of response actions may be asserted against the Fund by any person other 
than the United States Government, States, and political subdivisions 
thereof, except to the extent the claimant is otherwise compensated for 
the loss. States and political subdivisions may assert such claims if 
they are potentially responsible parties subject to an agreement reached 
pursuant to section 122(b)(1) of CERCLA.
    (b) Claims presented by an individual must be signed by that 
individual. If, because of death, disability, or other reasons 
satisfactory to EPA, the foregoing requirement cannot be fulfilled, the 
claim may be filed by a duly authorized agent, executor, administrator, 
or other legal representative. A claim presented by an entity or an 
authorized agent, executor, administrator, or other legal representative 
must be presented in the name of the claimant. The claim must be signed 
by the authorized agent, executor, administrator, or other legal 
representative (including the title or legal capacity of the person 
signing) and be accompanied by evidence of the authority to present a 
claim on behalf of the claimant as authorized agent, executor, 
administrator, or other legal representative.
    (c) A claim for response costs as to which any release from 
liability was executed between the claimant and a potentially 
responsible party may be presented against the Fund to the extent that 
the claimant obtained EPA's approval prior to executing such release and 
provided that the other requirements of this part are met.
    (d) A foreign claimant may present a response claim to the Fund, to 
the same extent that a United States claimant may assert a claim, if:
    (1) The requirements of Sec. 307.21 and Sec. 307.22 are met; and
    (2) The release of a hazardous substance occurred in the navigable 
waters of the United States, including the territorial sea, or in or on 
the territorial sea or adjacent shoreline of a foreign country of which 
the claimant is a resident; and
    (3) The claimant is not otherwise compensated for the loss; and
    (4)The hazardous substance was released from a facility or from a 
vessel located adjacent to or within the navigable waters or was 
discharged in connection with activities conducted under the Outer 
Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.), or the 
Deepwater Port Act of 1974, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.); and
    (5) Recovery is authorized by a treaty or an executive agreement 
between the United States and the foreign country involved, or if the 
Secretary of State, in consultation with the Attorney General and other 
appropriate officials, certifies that such country provides a comparable 
remedy for United States claimants.


<R05>
 Sec. 307.21   Nature of eligible claims.

    (a) Claims may be asserted against the Fund for necessary costs 
incurred for response actions due to a release or substantial threat of 
release of a hazardous substance into the environment; a release or 
substantial threat of release of pollutants or contaminants into the 
environment that may present an imminent or substantial danger to public 
health or welfare; or actions taken by a potentially responsible party 
subject to an agreement reached pursuant to section 122(b)(1) of CERCLA. 
Claims must be filed in accordance with Sec. 307.22. Claims may be 
asserted for the costs of removal actions, remedial planning activities, 
and remedial actions.
    (b) Costs will be considered to be eligible under this section if:

[[Page 416]]

    (1) The response action is preauthorized by EPA pursuant to 
Sec. 307.22;
    (2) The costs are incurred for activities within the scope of EPA's 
preauthorization;
    (3) The response action is conducted in a manner consistent with the 
NCP; and
    (4) The costs incurred are necessary costs pursuant to Sec. 307.11 
of this part.
    (c)Money in the Fund may be used for paying any claim under this 
section for expenses incurred for the payment of contractor claims 
either through settlement of such claims or an award by a third party to 
the extent EPA determines that:
    (1) The contractor claim arose from work within the scope of the 
contract at issue and the contract was for preauthorized response 
activities;
    (2) The contractor claim is meritorious;
    (3) The contractor claim was not caused by the mismanagement of the 
claimant;
    (4) The contractor claim was not caused by the claimant's vicarious 
liability for the improper actions of others;
    (5) The claimed amount is reasonable and necessary;
    (6) The claim for such costs is filed by the claimant within 5 years 
of completion of the preauthorized response action; and
    (7) Payment of such a claim will not result in total payments from 
the Fund in excess of the maximum amount for which claims were 
preauthorized.
    (d) An award by a third party on a contractor claim under paragraph 
(c) of this section should include:
    (1) Findings of fact;
    (2) Conclusions of law;
    (3) Allocation of responsibility for each issue;
    (4) Basis for the amount of award; and
    (5) The rationale for the decision.
    (e) Money in the Fund may not be used for paying any claim under 
this section for expenses incurred for procurement transactions that 
were not conducted in a manner that provided to the maximum extent 
practicable, open and free competition; unduly restricted or eliminated 
competition; and did not provide where applicable for the award of 
contracts to the lowest responsive, responsible bidder where the 
selection was made principally on the basis of price.
    (f) Money in the Fund may not be used for paying any claim under 
this section for expenses incurred by a person operating pursuant to a 
procurement contract or assistance agreement with the United States.
    (g) Money in the Fund may not be used for paying any claim under 
this section for expenses incurred for the payment of persons who are on 
the ``List of Parties Excluded From Federal Procurement or Non-
Procurement'' at the time the contract is awarded, unless EPA approval 
is obtained in advance.
    (h) Unless EPA waives this requirement prior to the award of a 
construction contract, money in the Fund may not be used for paying any 
claim under this section for expenses incurred under such a construction 
contract that does not contain a ``differing site conditions'' clause 
equivalent to the following:
    (1) The contractor shall promptly, and before such conditions are 
disturbed, notify the claimant in writing of:
    (i) Subsurface or latent physical conditions at the site differing 
materially from those listed in this contract, or
    (ii) Unknown physical conditions at the site, of an unusual nature, 
differing materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally 
recognized as inherent in work of the character provided for in this 
contract.
    (2) Upon notification by the construction contractor, the claimant 
shall promptly investigate the conditions. If the claimant finds that 
conditions materially differ and will cause an increase or decrease in 
the contractor's cost or the time required to perform any part of the 
work under its contract, whether or not changed as a result of such 
conditions, the claimant shall make an equitable adjustment and modify 
the contract in writing.
    (3) No claim of the contractor under the differing site conditions 
clause shall be allowed unless the contractor has given the notice 
required in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. However,

[[Page 417]]

the claimant may extend the time prescribed in paragraph (h)(1) of this 
section.
    (4) No claim by the contractor for an equitable adjustment shall be 
allowed if asserted after final payment under this contract.
    (i) Where money in the Fund has been used to pay for any response 
costs under this section, no other claim may be paid out of the Fund for 
the same costs.


<R05>

    (5) Proposed procedures using sealed bidding to select the 
construction contractor, or an explanation of why the applicant intends 
to use any other method; and
    (6) Documentation showing that the response will be carried out in 
accordance with applicable or relevant and appropriate environmental 
requirements. Documentation should include the potential impacts on any 
environmentally sensitive areas.
    (g) Claims of business confidentiality may be asserted for 
information submitted to EPA under this subpart. Information claimed 
confidential will be disclosed by EPA only to the extent permitted by 
CERCLA, this subpart, and part 2, subpart B, of this chapter.
    (1) Any claim of business confidentiality must accompany the 
information when it is submitted to EPA. Claims must be asserted as 
prescribed on the forms. Items claimed confidential on the forms and 
attachments to the forms must be clearly marked by circling or 
bracketing them.
    (2) The applicant or response claimant must provide EPA with two 
copies of its submittal if any information is claimed confidential.
    (i) One copy of the submittal must be complete, with items claimed 
confidential clearly marked in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this

    (ii) The second copy must be complete except that all information 
claimed as confidential in the first copy must be deleted. EPA may make 
this second copy available to the public.
    (iii) If the applicant does not provide a redacted copy, the 
application for preauthorization is incomplete. If the claimant does not 
provide a redacted copy, the claim against the Fund will not be 
perfected by EPA. EPA will not process such submittals until it receives 
the redacted copy.
    (3) If a submitter of a response claim or an application for 
preauthorization does not assert a claim of business confidentiality for 
information at the time the information is submitted to EPA, the Agency 
may make the information public without further notice to the submitter.

[[Page 419]]

    (h) In addition to the foregoing, an application for 
preauthorization filed by a potentially responsible party for partial 
reimbursement of response costs shall include:
    (1) A copy of the settlement agreement, or the most recent draft of 
any pending agreement, reached between such parties and the Federal 
Government; and
    (2) If the application is to undertake a remedial investigation and 
feasibility study, an affirmation that the applicant will not directly 
or indirectly benefit from the preauthorization as a response action 
contractor, or as a person hired or retained by such a contractor with 
respect to the site at issue and an agreement to reimburse the Fund for 
any costs incurred under, or in connection with, the oversight contract 
or arrangement for the remedial investigation and feasibility study.
    (i) If it is subsequently determined that the preauthorized response 
actions require modification or if it appears that project costs will 
exceed approved costs, a revised application for preauthorization must 
be approved by EPA before different, or additional, actions can be 
undertaken, if such actions are to be eligible for compensation from the 
Fund.
    (j) Unless otherwise specified and agreed to by EPA, the terms, 
provisions, or requirements of a court judgment, Consent Decree, 
administrative order (whether unilateral or on consent), or any other 
consensual agreement with EPA requiring a response action do not 
constitute preauthorization to present a claim to the Fund.


<R05>
Sec. 307.23  EPA's review of preauthorization applications.

    (a) EPA shall review each preauthorization application and will 
notify the applicant of the decision to grant or deny preauthorization. 
Decisions to grant preauthorization will be memorialized in a PDD.
    (b) Each application for preauthorization must include information 
sufficient for EPA to determine whether the response will be consistent 
with 40 CFR 300.700(d). EPA will evaluate applications based on the 
following non-exclusive list of criteria, as appropriate:
    (1) Whether the release is within the scope of CERCLA;
    (2) The seriousness of the problem or importance of the response 
activity when compared with competing demands on the Fund;
    (3) Whether there is sufficient time to process the request for 
preauthorization (e.g., if a removal action is proposed);
    (4) Whether the party liable for the release or threat of release of 
the hazardous substance is unknown, or if known, has been notified of 
the application for preauthorization and is unwilling or incapable of 
performing the response in a reasonable period of time;
    (5) Whether the State, a political subdivision, or an Indian Tribe 
is willing to undertake the response action through a contract or a 
cooperative agreement;
    (6) The cost and effectiveness of the proposed response actions when 
compared with other alternatives;
    (7) Whether proposed response can be carried out in accordance with 
the NCP and other environmental requirements;
    (8) The applicant's eligibility to file a claim; his capabilities, 
experience, and technical expertise; and his knowledge and familiarity 
with the NCP and relevant guidance;
    (9) Whether the party is proposing to conduct a cleanup through an 
administrative order or a Consent Decree with the Government regarding 
the site for which the request is made (if the applicant is a 
potentially responsible party);
    (10) Whether the applicant, if he is a potentially responsible party 
seeking to undertake a remedial investigation and feasibility study, has 
affirmed that he will not directly or indirectly benefit from the 
preauthorization as a response action contractor, or as a person hired 
or retained by such a contract with respect to the site at issue, and 
agrees to reimburse the Fund for any cost incurred under, or in 
connection with, the oversight contract or arrangement for the remedial 
investigation and feasibility study;
    (11) Whether the proposed costs are eligible and the applicant has 
proposed appropriate procurement, contract

reporting of project issues and progress;
    (16) Cooperation of the applicant at any earlier stage of response 
activity; and
    (17) Whether the proposed schedule for filing a claim(s) is based 
upon the completion of the project, an operable unit, or a discrete 
phase of the response work.
    (c) The Administrator may grant preauthorization for all or part of 
a proposed response action, but not less than a stage of an operable 
unit or of a response action.
    (1) The Administrator may set a limit on the amount that may be 
claimed as reimbursement from the Fund for any response action.
    (2) The Administrator may condition the preauthorization on such 
inspection, monitoring, reporting, safety, and long-term operation and 
maintenance requirements as he deems necessary. The costs of such 
requirements may not necessarily be reimbursed from the Fund.
    (3) The Administrator may condition the preauthorization on such 
time period for starting and completing the response action as he may 
deem necessary.
    (4) The Administrator may condition the preauthorization on such 
financial or other assurance from the claimant or other entity as he may 
deem necessary to ensure completion of work at the site.
    (5) The Administrator will not subject potentially responsible 
parties who may wish to undertake a remedial investigation and 
feasibility study to a lesser standard of liability nor will he give 
such parties preferential treatment in EPA's review of applications for 
preauthorization.
    (d) If EPA denies a preauthorization because of an insufficient 
balance in the Fund or the low priority assigned to the response action 
when weighed against other applications or uses of the Fund, the 
applicant may resubmit the application in another fiscal year. If 
preauthorization is denied because of the inability of the applicant to 
demonstrate his experience and capabilities, the applicant may resubmit 
the application form only after correcting the deficiencies, or by 
proposing an alternative approach.
    (e) If EPA grants preauthorization, the applicant may begin the 
approved response action subject to the terms and conditions contained 
in the PDD. The applicant, as a condition of preauthorization, shall 
assure that the lead agency shall have such site access as may be 
necessary for oversight and monitoring.
    (f) If the applicant is unable to initiate or complete the 
preauthorized response action, the applicant shall immediately notify 
EPA in writing.
    (g) EPA will not grant preauthorization for any response actions 
where:
    (1) The proposed action is not a response action authorized under 
CERCLA;
    (2) There is a significant threat to the public health or the 
environment caused by acute threat of fire, explosion, direct human 
contact with a hazardous substance, or other similar hazardous 
situations requiring immediate action, and there is insufficient time to 
process an application for preauthorization;
    (3) The proposed response is a remedial action and the site is not 
on the NPL; or
    (4) The action is to be performed by a State, political subdivision, 
Indian Tribe through an assistance agreement with the United States, or 
a person operating pursuant to a contract with the United States.
    (h) EPA will deny preauthorization to a person whom the Agency 
believes is a liable party under section 107 of CERCLA unless 
negotiations are underway aimed at reaching a judicial or administrative 
settlement. Such parties may be preauthorized under this paragraph to 
submit claims to the

[[Page 421]]

Fund for response costs up to the maximum amount specified in the PDD.


<R04>
     Subpart C--Procedures for Filing and Processing Response Claims


<R05>
Sec. 307.30  Requesting payment from the potentially responsible party.

    (a) A claimant must present all claims to any person who is known to 
the claimant and who may be liable under section 107 of CERCLA at least 
60 days before filing a claim against the Fund. The presentation to the 
potentially responsible party must be a written request for payment, 
delivered either by certified mail (return receipt requested) or in such 
a manner as will establish the date of receipt. At a minimum this 
request must contain:
    (1) The name of the claimant (commercial entity or individual);
    (2) The name, title, and address of any authorized representative;
    (3) The location of the release and cleanup;
    (4) The date of the release, if known;
    (5) The owner of the property, if other than the claimant;
    (6) A description of the response action taken; and
    (7) The amount of the request (in dollars);
    (8) If applicable, notice of intent to file a subsequent application 
for preauthorization or claim against the Fund for additional operable 
units or for a stage of a response action.
    (b) Where the potentially responsible party is unknown, the claimant 
must make a good-faith effort to identify the potentially responsible 
party prior to submitting a claim. If the potentially responsible party 
is identified, the claimant must then comply with the procedures of 
Sec. 307.30(a). Where a potentially responsible party cannot be 
identified, the claimant may submit a claim to the Fund pursuant to 
Sec. 307.31. Claims submitted under this paragraph must be accompanied 
by documentation of efforts to identify potentially responsible parties.
    (c) If the claimant and the potentially responsible party agree to a 
settlement involving a release from liability, the claimant may submit a 
claim against the Fund for any costs that are not recovered provided the 
claimant complies with the provisions of Sec. 307.20(c), which require 
EPA's prior approval of such releases from liability.
    (d) If the claim is denied by the potentially responsible party, or 
has not been satisfied after 60 days of presentation to such party, the 
claimant may submit a claim to the Fund in accordance with Sec. 307.31.
    (e) If the first claim was denied by the potentially responsible 
party or not responded to, and EPA agrees that there is no reason to 
believe that subsequent claims would be honored by such potentially 
responsible party, the denial of the first claim, or lack of response, 
shall be considered denial of every subsequent claim.


<R05>
Sec. 307.31  Filing procedures.

    (a) A response claim must be submitted on EPA Form 2075-4 and must 
include:
    (1) Documentation showing that the claimed response activities were 
preauthorized by EPA;
    (2) Documentation showing that the response activity was 
accomplished in a manner consistent with the PDD, noting any deviation 
from preauthorized activities;
    (3) Documentation that a search to identify potentially responsible 
parties was conducted in accordance with Sec. 307.30 and of any contacts 
with such parties; and
    (4) Substantiation that all claimed costs are necessary costs.
    (b) Claimants (or their authorized representatives) may amend their 
claims at any time before final action by EPA. Amendment of claims after 
final action by EPA will be allowed only at EPA's discretion. Each 
amendment must be submitted in writing and must be signed by the 
claimant or authorized representative. The time limitations of 
Sec. 307.32(i) refer to the date by which an amendment is filed.
    (c) Claimants may not pursue both an action in court against 
potentially responsible parties and a claim against the Fund at the same 
time for the same response costs. EPA will return claims presented under 
this subpart when the Agency determines that a claimant has initiated an 
action for recovery of the same response costs, in

[[Page 422]]

court, against a party potentially liable under section 107 of CERCLA.


<R05>
Sec. 307.32  Verification, award, and administrative hearings.

    (a) Upon receipt of a response claim, EPA will verify that it 
complies with all filing requirements. Where the claim is incomplete or 
has significant defects, EPA will return the claim to the claimant with 
written notification of its deficiencies.
    (b) A claim returned to the claimant for failure to comply with the 
filing requirements may be resubmitted to EPA.
    (c) For purposes of this part, a response claim is deemed perfected 
when EPA determines that the claim complies fully with the specified 
filing requirements; i.e., the claim is technically complete. When the 
claim is perfected, a notice will be provided to the claimant of EPA's 
receipt and acceptance of the claim for evaluation.
    (d) EPA may adjust claims and in making a determination whether 
costs are allowable, EPA will be guided by the Federal cost principles 
(non-profit organizations--OMB Circular A-122; States and political 
subdivisions--OMB Circular A-87; profit-making organizations--48 CFR 
part 31, subparts 31.1 and 31.2).
    (e) In evaluating claims, EPA will determine whether the claimant 
has settled and satisfactorily completed in accordance with sound 
business judgment and good administrative practice all contractual and 
administrative matters arising out of agreements to perform 
preauthorized response actions. This includes the issuance of 
invitations for bids or requests for proposals, selection of 
contractors, approval of subcontracts, settlement of protests, claims 
disputes, and other related procurement matters. EPA will examine how 
the claimant assured (e.g., by the use of a subcontract administration 
system) that work was performed in accordance with the terms, 
conditions, and specifications of such agreements.
    (f) Awards will be made:
    (1) Only for necessary costs of completing the response action or 
stage of an operable unit or of a response action;
    (2) Only to the extent that the response actions were preauthorized 
by EPA pursuant to Sec. 307.23;
    (3) Only to the extent that the cleanup was performed effectively, 
as provided in 40 CFR 300.120(e)(3) and 300.400(h); and
    (4) Only to the extent that the cleanup was performed in compliance 
with the terms and conditions of the PDD.
    (g) No award will be made on a claim where the claimant has 
purported to release a potentially responsible party from liability to 
the United States for the same costs unless EPA has approved the release 
in advance.
    (h) Where a response action is determined to have been ineffective 
due to acts or omissions of the claimant, his employees or agents, or 
any third party having a contractual relationship with the claimant, 
payment of the claim will be adjusted accordingly. EPA may require the 
claimant to submit any additional information needed to determine 
whether the actions taken were reasonable and necessary.
    (i) For claims submitted in connection with a settlement reached 
under section 122(b)(1) of CERCLA only, interest will be paid on amounts 
due if EPA fails to pay the amount within 60 days of a perfected claim.
    (1) Interest shall accrue on the amounts due the claimant where EPA 
fails to pay the claim for the preauthorized response action within 60 
days of EPA's receipt of a perfected claim.
    (2) Where the claim is technically complete but EPA requires 
additional information in order to evaluate the amount claimed, the 
period as stated in paragraph (i)(1) of this section or the accrual of 
interest is suspended from the date the Agency requests the information 
from the claimant until the date the requested information is received.
    (3) Where a claim is denied in whole or in part by EPA, and the 
claimant requests an administrative hearing in accordance with paragraph 
(o) of this section, interest on the disputed amount begins to accrue 50 
days after an award by the Administrative Law Judge, unless an appeal is 
filed. If either party files an appeal with a Federal district

[[Page 423]]

court, interest will not accrue until 20 days after the final judicial 
decision.
    (4) The rate of interest paid on a claim is the rate of interest on 
investments of the Fund established by Subchapter A of Chapter 98 of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
    (j) For claims submitted in connection with a settlement reached 
under section 122(b) of CERCLA, a preauthorized potentially responsible 
party will be entitled to full reimbursement only where the response 
action is conducted in complete satisfaction of the requirements set 
forth in the consent order or decree.
    (k) Future site-specific actions required by preauthorized 
potentially responsible parties, and any future obligations on the Fund, 
shall be governed by Sec. 307.42.
    (l) Any withdrawal of preauthorization will be preceded by written 
notice from EPA. The application for preauthorization will be deemed 
invalid and no award will be made from the Fund where the claimant is 
determined by EPA to be liable under section 107 of CERCLA for the costs 
for which the claim is made, and the application for preauthorization 
did not disclose that the claimant may be a person described as follows:
    (1) The owner and operator of a vessel or a facility;
    (2) Any person, who at the time of disposal of any hazardous 
substance, owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous 
substances were disposed of;
    (3) Any person who by contract, agreement, or otherwise arranged for 
disposal or treatment, or arranged with a transporter for transport for 
disposal or treatment, of hazardous substances owned or possessed by 
such person, by any other party or entity, at any facility or 
incineration vessel owned or operated by another party or entity and 
containing such hazardous substance; or
    (4) Any person who accepts or accepted any hazardous substances for 
transport to disposal or treatment facilities, incineration vessels or 
sites selected by such person, from which there is a release, or a 
threatened release which causes the incurrence of response costs, of a 
hazardous substance.
    (m) If EPA determines that it cannot complete its evaluation of a 
claim because of insufficient information, it will request the necessary 
information from the claimant. If EPA determines that it cannot complete 
its evaluation of a claim because the records, documents, and other 
evidence were not maintained in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles and practices consistently applied, or were for 
any reason inadequate to demonstrate that claimed costs are necessary 
costs, EPA will adjust the claim accordingly. Further consideration of 
such amounts will depend on the adequacy of subsequent documentation. 
Any additional information requested by EPA must be submitted within 30 
days, unless a different period of time is specified by EPA. The failure 
of the claimant to provide in a timely manner the requested information 
without reasonable cause may be cause for denial of the claim.
    (n) Once the claim is perfected, EPA will proceed to:
    (1) Make an award on the claim; or
    (2) Decline to make an award.
    (o) If the claimant is dissatisfied either with EPA's denial of a 
claim or with the amount of an award, the claimant may request that EPA 
arrange an administrative hearing in accordance with section 112(b) of 
CERCLA. The request for an administrative hearing must occur within 30 
days of being notified of EPA's decision.
    (p) Notice of an award under paragraph (f) of this section will be 
given by First Class Mail within five (5) days of the date of the 
decision. Payment of approved claims will be made according to 
Sec. 307.40.


<R05>
Sec. 307.33  Records retention.

    A claimant receiving an award from the Fund is required to maintain 
all cost documentation and any other records relating to the claim, and 
to provide EPA with access to such records. These records must be 
maintained until cost recovery is initiated by EPA. If, after ten (10) 
years from the date of award of the final claim, EPA has not initiated a 
cost recovery action, the claimant need no longer retain the records. 
The claimant shall,

[[Page 424]]

however, notify EPA of the location of the records, and allow EPA the 
opportunity to take possession of the records before they are destroyed. 
The claimant shall cause to be inserted in all agreements between itself 
and contractors performing work at the site a clause providing for the 
same requirement to maintain records and to provide access to records as 
that required of the claimant.


<R04>
                   Subpart D--Payments and Subrogation


<R05>
Sec. 307.40   Payment of approved claims.

    (a) Payment of claims will be made, as applicable, within:
    (1) 50 days of EPA's decision to make an award, if the claimant does 
not request an administrative hearing;
    (2) 50 days of an award by an administrative tribunal if no appeal 
of such award is taken; or
    (3) 20 days of the final judicial decision of any appeal taken.
    (b) Payment of a claim shall not be seen as EPA's final acceptance 
of the claimant's response action. Final acceptance shall await EPA's 
determination that the response action was conducted in accordance with 
the terms and conditions of the PDD or the consent order or decree, as 
applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 307.41  Subrogation of claimants' rights to the Fund.

    (a) The United States acquires by subrogation all rights of the 
claimant to recover the amount of the claim paid by the Fund from the 
person or persons liable under section 107 of CERCLA for the release 
giving rise to the response action.
    (b) Claimants shall assist in any cost recovery action that may be 
initiated by the United States. The claimant and the claimant's 
contractors shall furnish the personnel, services, documents, and 
materials needed to assist EPA in the collection of evidence to document 
work performed and costs expended by the claimant or the claimant's 
contractors at the particular site in order to aid in cost recovery 
efforts. The claimant and the claimant's contractors shall also provide 
all requested assistance in the interpretation of documents detailing 
work and costs that may be needed as evidence, and shall testify on 
behalf of the United States in any judicial or administrative cost 
recovery proceeding regarding the response costs claimed. All of the 
claimant's contracts for implementing the PDD shall expressly require 
their contractors to provide this cost recovery assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 307.42  Fund's obligation in the event of failure of remedial actions taken pursuant to CERCLA section 122.

    (a) In the case of the failure of a completed remedial action taken 
by a potentially responsible party pursuant to a remedial action 
preauthorized in connection with a settlement under section 122(b)(1) of 
CERCLA, the Fund shall be available for the costs of any new cleanup 
required, but shall not be obligated to a proportion exceeding that 
proportion contributed by the Fund for the original remedial action.
    (b) The Fund is not obligated by preauthorization of a response 
action to reimburse the claimant for subsequent remedial actions if 
those subsequent remedial actions are necessary as a result of the 
failure of the claimant, his employees or agents, or any third party 
having a contractual relationship with the claimant to properly perform 
authorized activities or otherwise comply with the terms and conditions 
of the PDD, and the Consent Decree or order regarding the site cleanup 
entered into by EPA and the claimant.

 Appendix C to Part 307--Notice of Limitations on the Payment of Claims 
  for Response Actions, Which is to be Placed in the Federal Register 
           Preamble Whenever Sites Are Added to the Final NPL

    Limitations on the Payment of Claims for Response Actions
    Sections 111(a)(2) and 122(b)(1) of CERCLA authorize the Fund to 
reimburse certain parties for necessary costs of performing a response 
action. As is described in more detail at 58 FR 5460, Jan. 21, 1993, 40 
CFR part 307, there are two major limitations placed on the payment of 
claims for response actions. First, only private parties, certain 
potentially responsible parties (including States and political 
subdivisions), and certain foreign entities are eligible to file such 
claims. Second, all response actions under sections 111(a)(2) and 
122(b)(1) must receive prior approval, or ``preauthorization,'' from 
EPA.

 Appendix D to Part 307--Notice of Limitations on the Payment of Claims 
      for Response Actions Which is to be Placed in Public Dockets

  Statutory Limitations on the Payment of Claims for Response Actions 
      Filed Pursuant to Sections 111(a)(2) and 122(b)(1) of CERCLA

    The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and 
Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments 
and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) 
authorizes a number of mechanisms for responding to a release, or threat 
of release, of hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants. One 
of these mechanisms is response claims. Section 111(a)(2) of CERCLA 
authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) to 
compensate claimants for necessary response costs if certain conditions 
are met. Section 122(b)(1) of CERCLA authorizes EPA to reimburse certain 
potentially responsible parties for a portion of the costs of response 
actions conducted pursuant to a settlement agreement. These conditions 
are outlined below.
    First, only private parties, parties to section 122(b)(1) agreements 
(including States and political subdivisions thereof) and foreign 
entities are eligible for payment through the response claims mechanism. 
Federal, State, and local government units, and Indian Tribes can 
receive funding for response activities through other authorities of 
section 111(a) or section 123 of CERCLA.
    Second, eligible claimants can only be reimbursed for costs that are 
incurred in carrying out the National Contingency Plan (NCP), 40 CFR 
part 300. In order to be in conformity with the NCP, all claims must 
receive prior approval, or ``preauthorization,'' from EPA. This means 
that before response work is initiated, the party must:
     (1) Notify EPA of its intent to file a claim;
     (2) Demonstrate that the release merits priority consideration;
     (3) Propose activities to remedy the release that can be carried 
out consistent with the NCP; and
     (4) Demonstrate the capabilities necessary to carry out such 
activities in a safe and effective manner.
 In order for potentially responsible parties to be eligible for 
reimbursement they must conduct the response actions as specified in a 
Consent Decree or administrative order. Only if EPA preauthorizes a 
response action can the party begin work, and later file a claim for 
reimbursement of costs.
    The limitations placed on the payment of claims for response actions 
and the procedures for filing such claims are described in more detail 
at 58 FR 5460, Jan. 21, 1993, 40 CFR part 307. Additional information 
can be obtained by contacting William O. Ross, Office of Emergency and 
Remedial Response (5203 G), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M 
Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, (703) 603-8798, or the RCRA/CERCLA 
Hotline, (800) 424-9346 (or (703) 920-9810 in the Washington, DC 
metropolitan area).

                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 310.05  Purpose, scope, and applicability.

    (a) Purpose. Through this part, the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) is establishing the procedures for reimbursing local governments 
for temporary emergency measures to prevent or mitigate injury to human 
health or the environment, as authorized under section 123 of the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 
1980 (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and 
Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA). This program is intended to 
alleviate significant financial burden on local governments for response 
to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances or pollutants 
or contaminants and will not supplant local funds normally provided for 
response. Reimbursement does not apply to expenditures incurred in the 
course of providing what are traditionally local services and 
responsibilities, such as routine firefighting.
    (b) Scope. Applications for reimbursement for temporary emergency 
measures may be submitted only through the procedures established in 
this part. Any general purpose unit of local government for a political 
subdivision may request reimbursement. States are not eligible for this 
program. Under this part, local governments may apply for reimbursement 
for temporary emergency measures performed subsequent to October 21, 
1987. Reimbursement may be made for temporary emergency measures 
conducted during either Federal-lead or non-Federal-lead responses.
    (c) Applicability. Reimbursement to local governments for temporary 
emergency measures may not exceed $25,000 per single response, nor may 
reimbursement supplant local funds normally provided for response. 
Because CERCLA specifies that no more than 0.1% of the amount 
appropriated from the Hazardous Substance Superfund (Superfund or the 
Fund) may be allocated to the reimbursement program for the five fiscal 
years beginning October 1, 1986, some requests may not ever be 
reimbursed even though they meet all requirements of this part.

                        Subpart B--Reimbursement


<R05>
Sec. 310.20  Eligibility for reimbursement.

    (a) Any general purpose unit of local government may request 
reimbursement for temporary emergency measures if all requirements under 
Sec. 310.30 are met.
    (b) States are not eligible for reimbursement for temporary 
emergency measures and no State may request reimbursement on its own 
behalf or on the behalf of political subdivisions within the State.


<R05>
Sec. 310.30  Requirements for requesting reimbursement.

    (a) Response must have been initiated on or after October 21, 1987, 
the effective date of the interim final rule which governed the 
reimbursement process prior to the effective date of this part.
    (b) The local government must inform EPA or the National Response 
Center (NRC) of the response as soon as possible, but not later than 24 
hours after the start of a response, unless EPA or the USCG has been 
contacted via the NRC or other established response communication 
channel. EPA Regional offices and NRC telephone numbers are listed in 
appendix I of this part.
    (c) Requests for reimbursement must demonstrate that response 
actions are consistent with CERCLA, the NCP and, where applicable, the 
local comprehensive emergency response plan completed under the 
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA).
    (d) Requests for reimbursement must provide assurance that 
reimbursement for costs incurred for temporary emergency measures does 
not supplant local funds normally provided for response.
    (e) Applicants for reimbursement must first present requests for 
payment of incurred costs to all known potentially responsible parties 
(PRPs) and permit at least 60 days for payment or for expression of 
intent to pay or willingness to negotiate prior to submitting a 
reimbursement request to the Agency. Local governments also must pursue 
all other sources of reimbursement (e.g., insurance, reimbursement from 
the State) before seeking reimbursement from EPA under this part.
    (f) After October 17, 1988, the applicant's jurisdiction must be 
included in the comprehensive emergency response plan completed by the 
Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) as required by section 303(a) 
of EPCRA. This requirement does not apply if the State Emergency 
Response Commission (SERC) has not established an LEPC responsible for 
the emergency planning district(s) encompassing the applicant's 
geographic boundaries.

<R05>
Sec. 310.40  Allowable and unallowable costs.

    To be allowable, costs for which reimbursement is sought must be 
consistent with CERCLA and with Federal cost principles outlined in the 
OMB Circular A-87, ``Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.'' 
The local government may also seek assistance from the EPA Regional 
Office in determining which costs may be allowable. Final determination 
of the reasonableness of the costs for which reimbursement is sought 
will be made by EPA.
    (a) Allowable cost. In general, allowable costs are those project 
costs are eligible, reasonable, necessary and allocable to the project. 
Costs allowable for reimbursement may include, but are not limited to:
    (1) ``Disposable materials and supplies'' acquired, consumed, and 
expended specifically for the purpose of the response for which 
reimbursement is being requested (hereafter referred to as ``the 
response'');

[[Page 435]]

    (2) Compensation for unbudgeted wages of employees for the time and 
efforts devoted specifically to the response that are not otherwise 
provided for in the applicant's operating budget (e.g., overtime pay for 
permanent full-time and other than full-time employees);
    (3) Rental or leasing of equipment used specifically for the 
response (e.g., protective equipment or clothing, scientific and 
technical equipment) (Note: reimbursement for these costs will not 
exceed the duration of the response);
    (4) Replacement costs for equipment owned by the applicant that is 
contaminated beyond reuse or repair, if the applicant can demonstrate 
that the equipment was a total loss and that the loss occurred during 
the response (e.g., self-contained breathing apparatus irretrievably 
contaminated during the response);
    (5) Decontamination of equipment contaminated during the response;
    (6) Special technical services specifically required for the 
response (e.g., costs associated with the time and efforts of technical 
experts/specialists not otherwise provided for by the local government);
    (7) Other special services specifically required for the response 
(e.g., utilities);
    (8) Laboratory costs for purposes of analyzing samples taken during 
the response;
    (9) Evacuation costs associated with the services, supplies, and 
equipment procured for a specific evacuation; and
    (10) Containerization or packaging cost including transportation and 
disposal of hazardous wastes.
    (b) Unallowable costs. Unallowable costs for reimbursement include, 
but are not limited to:
    (1) Purchase or routine maintenance of equipment of a durable nature 
that is expected to have a period of service of one year or more after 
being put into use without material impairment of its physical 
condition, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(4) and (a)(5) of this 
section;
    (2) Materials and supplies not purchased specifically for the 
response;
    (3) Employee fringe benefits;
    (4) Administrative costs for filing reimbursement applications;
    (5) Employee out-of-pocket expenses normally provided for in the 
applicant's operating budget (e.g., meals, fuel);
    (6) Legal expenses that may be incurred as a result of response 
activities, including efforts to recover costs for potentially 
responsible parties; and
    (7) Medical expenses incurred as a result of response activities.
    (c) Detailed cost documentation. Detailed cost documentation must be 
provided by the local government and ensure that costs incurred are 
substantiated and that cost documentation is adequate for an Agency 
audit. Documentation of response costs must include at a minimum.
    (1) Specification of the temporary emergency measures for which 
reimbursement is requested;
    (2) Specification of the local agency incurring the cost;
    (3) Detailed breakdown of actual costs, by cost element such as 
overtime, equipment rental;
    (4) Supporting documents such as invoices, sales receipts, rental or 
leasing agreements; and
    (5) Generally accepted accounting practices consistently applied.

 Subpart C--Procedures for Filing and Processing Reimbursement Requests


<R05>
Sec. 310.50  Filing procedures.

    (a) Only one request for reimbursement will be accepted for each 
hazardous substance emergency requiring immediate response at the local 
level. When more than one local agency or government has participated in 
such a response, those agencies and governments must determine which 
single entity will submit the request on behalf of them all.
    (b) A request for reimbursement must be submitted on EPA form 9310-
1, illustrated in appendix II of this part, and must demonstrate that:
    (1) Costs for which reimbursement is sought were incurred for 
temporary emergency measures taken by the local government to protect 
human health and the environment from releases or

[[Page 436]]

threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants; 
temporary emergency measures may include security, source control, 
release containment, neutralization or other treatment methods, 
contaminated runoff control and similar activities mitigating immediate 
threats to human health and the environment;
    (2) Reasonable effort has been made to recover costs from the 
responsible party and from any other available source and that such 
effort has been unsuccessful; and
    (3) Response actions were not inconsistent with CERCLA, the NCP and, 
if applicable, the local emergency response plan required under Title 
III of SARA.
    (c) Applicants must certify that:
    (1) All costs are accurate and were incurred specifically for the 
response for which reimbursement is being requested:
    (2) The local government complied with the requirement to inform EPA 
or the USCG of the response, as specified in Sec. 310.30(b);
    (3) Reimbursement for costs incurred for response activities does 
not supplant local funds normally provided for response;
    (4) The Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) cannot be identified or 
is unwilling or unable to pay; and
    (5) If costs subsequently are recovered from responsible parties or 
other sources after the local government has received reimbursement from 
the Superfund, the local government agrees to return to EPA the 
reimbursement monies for which costs have been recovered.
    (d) Reimbursement requests must be received by EPA within one year 
of the date of completion of the response for which reimbursement is 
being requested. Late applications must include an explanation of the 
delay and will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
    (e) A request for reimbursement must be signed by the authorized 
representative who is the highest ranking official of the local 
government or his or her delegate.
    (f) Completed application and supporting data should be mailed to 
the LGR Project Officer, Emergency Response Division (5202-G), 
Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
2050-0077)


<R05>
Sec. 310.60  Verification and reimbursement.

    (a) Upon receipt of a reimbursement request, EPA will verify that it 
complies with all requirements. Where the request is incomplete or has 
significant defects, EPA will return the request to the applicant with 
written notification of its deficiencies.
    (b) A request returned to the applicant for correction of 
deficiencies must be resubmitted to EPA within 60 days.
    (c) For purposes of this part, a reimbursement request is deemed 
complete when EPA determines that the request complies fully with all 
requirements for reimbursement and with all filing procedures. When the 
request is complete, a notice will be provided to the applicant of EPA's 
receipt and acceptance for evaluation.
    (d) If EPA determines that it cannot complete its evaluation of a 
request because the records, documents and other evidence were not 
maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
and practices consistently applied, or were for any reason inadequate to 
demonstrate the reasonableness of the costs claimed, EPA may reject the 
request or make adjustments, if possible. Further consideration of such 
amounts will depend on the adequacy of subsequent documentation. Any 
additional information requested by EPA must be submitted within 60 days 
unless specifically extended by EPA. The failure of the applicant to 
provide in a timely manner the requested information without reasonable 
cause may be cause for denial of the reimbursement request.
    (e) When the reimbursement request is completed, EPA will rank the 
request on the basis of financial burden. Financial burden will be based 
on the ratio of eligible response costs to the applicant locality's 
annual per capita income adjusted for population, with larger fractions 
representing greater burden than smaller fractions. Per capita income 
and population statistics used to calculate financial burden shall

[[Page 437]]

be those published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the 
Census, in Current Population Reports, Local Population Estimates, 
Series P-26, ``1988 Population and 1987 Per Capita Income Estimates for 
Counties and Incorporated Places,'' Vols. 88-S-SC, 88-ENC-SC, 88-NE-SC, 
88-W-SC, 88-WNC-SC, March 1990. This incorporation by reference was 
approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 
U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. Copies are available from the Bureau of 
the Census, Office of Public Affairs, Department of Commerce, 
Constitution Avenue, NE, Washington, DC 20230 (1-202-763-4040). Copies 
may be inspected at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 401 M 
Street, SW, Washington, DC, or at the Office of the Federal Register, 
800 N. Capitol Street NW., 7th Floor, suite 700, Washington, DC. In 
ranking requests on the basis of financial burden, EPA also will give 
consideration to other relevant financial information supplied by the 
applicant. Once the request is ranked, EPA will:
    (1) Reimburse the request or;
    (2) Decline to reimburse the request; or
    (3) Hold the request for reconsideration if funding for the current 
review period has been exceeded.
    (f) Reimbursement will be made:
    (1) Only for costs that are allowable, reasonable and necessary; and
    (2) Only to the extent that the temporary emergency measures 
conformed to response criteria established by CERCLA, the NCP and the 
local emergency response plan, if applicable.
    (g) The EPA reimbursement official will provide the requester with a 
written final decision. Payment of approved requests will be made 
according to Sec. 310.80.
    (h) Requests that are not reimbursed after initial consideration 
remain open for reconsideration, at the EPA reimbursement official's 
discretion, for one year. EPA will notify the requester in writing if 
the request is held for later review. After that time, an unreimbursed 
request will no longer be considered and EPA will notify the requester 
in writing that the request has been denied.


<R05>
Sec. 310.70  Records retention.

    An applicant receiving a reimbursement from the Superfund is 
required to maintain all cost documentation and any other records 
relating to the reimbursement request and to provide EPA with access to 
such records. If, after ten years from the date of the reimbursement 
from the Superfund, EPA has not initiated a cost recovery action, the 
applicant need retain the records no longer. The applicant must provide 
EPA with a 60 day notice on its intent to destroy the records. This 
notification will allow EPA the opportunity to take possession of these 
records before they are destroyed.


<R05>
Sec. 310.80  Payment of approved reimbursement requests.

    A reimbursement from the Superfund can be paid only when Superfund 
monies are available. An approved request in excess of Superfund 
appropriations available to EPA may be paid only when additional money 
is appropriated. As appropriations in the Superfund become available, 
reimbursements will be made in the order in which approved requests are 
ranked, according to relative financial burden.


<R05>
Sec. 310.90  Disputes resolution.

    The procedures in this section apply to reviews of denial of 
reimbursement and reviews of amount of reimbursement.
    (a) The EPA reimbursement official's decision constitutes final 
Agency action unless the requester files a request for review by 
registered mail within 60 calendar days of the date of decision to the 
address given in Sec. 310.50(f).
    (b) The request for review of the EPA reimbursement official's final 
written decision must be filed with the disputes decision official 
identified in the final written decision.
    (c) The request for review must include:
    (1) A copy of the EPA reimbursement official's final decision;
    (2) A statement of the amount in dispute;
    (3) A description of the issues involved; and
    (4) A concise statement of the requester's objection to the final 
decision.

[[Page 438]]

    (d) After filing for review, the requester:
    (1) Is entitled to an informal conference with the EPA disputes 
decision official;
    (2) May be represented by counsel and may submit documentary 
evidence and briefs for inclusion in a written record; and
    (3) Is entitled to a written decision by the disputes decision 
official within 45 days from receipt of the request.

occupying the positions so titled.
    Business confidentiality or confidential business information 
includes the concept of trade secrecy and other related legal concepts 
which give (or may give) a business the right to preserve the 
confidentiality of business information and to limit its use or 
disclosure by others in order that the business may obtain or retain 
business advantages it derives from its right in the information. The 
definition is meant to encompass any concept which authorizes a Federal 
agency to withhold business information under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), as 
well as any concept which requires EPA to withhold information from the 
public for the benefit of a business under 18 U.S.C. 1905.
    Chief Executive Officer of the tribe means the person who is 
recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs as the chief elected 
administrative officer of the tribe.
    Claimant means a person submitting a claim of trade secrecy to EPA 
in connection with a chemical otherwise required to be disclosed in a 
report or other filing made under Title III.
    Commission means the emergency response commission for the State in 
which the facility is located except where the facility is located in 
Indian Country, in which case, commission means the emergency response 
commission for the tribe under whose jurisdiction the facility is 
located. In the

stationary items that are located on a single site or on contiguous or 
adjacent sites and which are owned or operated by the same person (or by 
any person which controls, is controlled by, or under common control 
with, such person). Facility shall include man-made structures as well 
as all natural structures in which chemicals are purposefully placed or 
removed through human means such that it functions as a containment 
structure for human use. For purposes of emergency release notification, 
the term includes motor vehicles, rolling stock, and aircraft.
    Indian Country means Indian country as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151. 
That section defines Indian country as:
    (a) All land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the 
jurisdiction of the United States government, notwithstanding the 
issuance of any patent, and including rights-of-way running through the 
reservation;
    (b) All dependent Indian communities within the borders of the 
United States whether within the original or subsequently acquired 
territory thereof, and whether within or without the limits of a State;

for the corporation owning or operating the facility or establishments 
responsible for certifying similar reports under other environmental 
regulatory requirements.
    Specific chemical identity means the chemical name, Chemical 
Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number, or any other information that 
reveals the precise chemical designation of the substance. Where the 
trade name is reported in lieu of the specific chemical identity, the 
trade name will be treated as the specific chemical identity for 
purposes of this part.
    State means any State of the United States, the District of 
Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the 
United States Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and any 
other territory or possession over which the United States has 
jurisdiction and Indian Country.
    Submitter means a person filing a required report or making a claim 
of trade secrecy to EPA under sections 303 (d)(2) and (d)(3), 311, 312,

<R05>
Sec. 350.3   Applicability of subpart; priority where provisions conflict; interaction with 40 CFR part 2.

    (a) Applicability of subpart. Sections 350.1 through 350.27 
establish rules governing assertion of trade secrecy claims for chemical 
identity information collected under the authority of sections 303 
(d)(2) and (d)(3), 311, 312 and 313 of Title III of the Superfund 
Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, and for trade secrecy or 
business confidentiality claims for information submitted in a 
substantiation under sections 303 (d)(2) and (d)(3), 311, 312, and 313 
of Title III. This subpart also establishes rules governing petitions 
from the public requesting the disclosure of chemical identity claimed 
as trade secret, and determinations by EPA of whether this information 
is entitled to trade secret treatment. Claims for confidentiality of the 
location of a hazardous chemical under section 312(d)(2)(F) of Title III 
are not subject to the requirements of this subpart.
    (b) Priority where provisions conflict. Where information subject to 
the requirements of this subpart is also collected under another 
statutory authority, the confidentiality provisions of that authority 
shall be used to claim that information as trade secret or confidential 
when submitting it to EPA under that statutory authority.
    (c) Interaction with 40 CFR part 2, EPA's Freedom of Information Act 
procedures. (1) No trade secrecy or business confidentiality claims 
other than those allowed in this subpart are permitted for information 
collected under sections 303 (d)(2) and (d)(3), 311, 312 and 313 of 
Title III.
    (2) Except as provided in Sec. 350.25 of this subpart, request for 
access to chemical identities withheld as trade secret under this 
regulation is solely through this regulation and procedures hereunder, 
not through EPA's Freedom of Information Act procedures set forth at 40 
CFR part 2.
    (3) Request for access to information other than chemical identity 
submitted to EPA under this regulation is through EPA's Freedom of 
Information Act regulations at 40 CFR part 2.


<R05>
Sec. 350.5  Assertion of claims of trade secrecy.

    (a) A claim of trade secrecy may be made only for the specific 
chemical identity of an extremely hazardous substance under sections 303 
(d)(2) and (d)(3), a hazardous chemical under sections 311 and 312, and 
a toxic chemical under section 313.
    (b) Method of asserting claims of trade secrecy for information 
submitted under sections 303 (d)(2) and (d)(3).
    (1) In submitting information to the local emergency planning 
committee under sections 303 (d)(2) or (d)(3), the submitter may claim 
as trade secret the specific chemical identity of any chemical subject 
to reporting under section 303.
    (2) To make a claim, the submitter shall submit to EPA the 
following:
    (i) A copy of the information which is being submitted under 
sections 303 (d)(2) or (d)(3) to the local emergency planning committee, 
with the chemical identity or identities claimed trade secret deleted, 
and the generic class or category of the chemical identity or identities 
inserted in its place. The method of choosing generic class or category 
is set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (ii) A sanitized and unsanitized substantiation in accordance with 
Sec. 350.7 for each chemical identity claimed as trade secret.
    (3) If the submitter wishes to claim information in the 
substantiation as trade secret or business confidential, it shall do so 
in accordance with Sec. 350.7(d).
    (4) Section 303 claims shall be sent to the address specified in 
Sec. 350.16 of this regulation.

[[Page 447]]

    (c) Method of asserting claims of trade secrecy for information 
submitted under section 311.
    (1) Submitters may claim as trade secret the specific chemical 
identity of any chemical subject to reporting under section 311 on the 
material safety data sheet or chemical list under section 311.
    (2) To assert a claim for a chemical identity on a material safety 
data sheet under section 311, the submitter shall submit to EPA the 
following:
    (i) One copy of the material safety data sheet which is being 
submitted to the State emergency response commission, the local 
emergency planning committee and the local fire department, which shall 
make it available to the public. In place of the specific chemical 
identity claimed as trade secret, the generic class or category of the 
chemical claimed as trade secret shall be inserted. The method of 
choosing generic class or category is set forth in paragraph (f) of this 
section.
    (ii) A sanitized and unsanitized substantiation in accordance with 
Sec. 350.7 for every chemical identity claimed as trade secret.
    (3) To assert a claim for a chemical identity on a list under 
section 311, the submitter shall submit to EPA the following:
    (i) An unsanitized copy of the chemical list under section 311. The 
submitter shall clearly indicate the specific chemical identity claimed 
as trade secret, and shall label it ``Trade Secret.'' The generic class 
or category of the chemical claimed as trade secret shall be inserted 
directly below the claimed chemical identity. The method of choosing 
generic class or category is set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (ii) A sanitized copy of the chemical list under section 311. This 
copy shall be identical to the document in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this 
section except that the submitter shall delete the chemical identity 
claimed as trade secret, leaving in place the generic class or category 
of the chemical claimed as trade secret. This copy shall be sent by the 
submitter to the State emergency response commission, the local 
emergency planning committee and the local fire department, which shall 
make it available to the public.
    (iii) A sanitized and unsanitized substantiation in accordance with 
Sec. 350.7 for every chemical identity claimed as trade secret.
    (4) If the submitter wishes to claim information in the 
substantiation as trade secret or business confidential, it shall do so 
in accordance with Sec. 350.7(d).
    (5) Section 311 claims shall be sent to the address specified in 
Sec. 350.16 of this regulation.
    (d) Method of asserting claims of trade secrecy for information 
submitted under section 312.
    (1) Submitters may claim as trade secret the specific chemical 
identity of any chemical subject to reporting under section 312.
    (2) To assert a claim the submitter shall submit to EPA the 
following:
    (i) An unsanitized copy of the Tier II emergency and hazardous 
chemical inventory form under section 312. (The Tier I emergency and 
hazardous chemical inventory form does not require the reporting of 
specific chemical identity and therefore no trade secrecy claims may be 
made with respect to that form.) The submitter shall clearly indicate 
the specific chemical identity claimed as trade secret by checking the 
box marked ``trade secret'' next to the claimed chemical identity.
    (ii) A sanitized copy of the Tier II emergency and hazardous 
chemical inventory form. This copy shall be identical to the document in 
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section except that the submitter shall 
delete the chemical identity or identities claimed as trade secret and 
include instead the generic class or category of the chemical claimed as 
trade secret. The method of choosing generic class or category is set 
forth in paragraph (f) of this section. The sanitized copy shall be sent 
by the submitter to the State emergency response commission, local 
emergency planning committee or the local fire department, whichever 
entity requested the information.
    (iii) A sanitized and unsanitized substantiation in accordance with 
Sec. 350.7 for every chemical identity claimed as trade secret.
    (3) If the submitter wishes to claim information in the 
substantiation as

[[Page 448]]

trade secret or business confidential, it shall do so in accordance with 
Sec. 350.7(d).
    (4) Section 312 claims shall be sent to the address specified in 
Sec. 350.16 of this regulation.
    (e) Method of asserting claims of trade secrecy for information 
submitted under section 313.
    (1) Submitters may claim as trade secret the specific chemical 
identity of any chemical subject to reporting under section 313.
    (2) To make a claim, the submitter shall submit to EPA the 
following:
    (i) An unsanitized copy of the toxic release inventory form under 
section 313 with the information claimed as trade secret clearly 
identified. To do this, the submitter shall check the box on the form 
indicating that the chemical identity is being claimed as trade secret. 
The submitter shall enter the generic class or category that is 
structurally descriptive of the chemical, as specified in paragraph (f) 
of this section.
    (ii) A sanitized copy of the toxic release inventory form. This copy 
shall be identical to the document in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this 
section except that the submitter shall delete the chemical identity 
claimed as trade secret. This copy shall also be submitted to the State 
official or officials designated to receive this information.
    (iii) A sanitized and unsanitized substantiation in accordance with 
Sec. 350.7 for every chemical identity claimed as trade secret.
    (3) If the submitter wishes to claim information in the 
substantiation as trade secret or business confidential, it shall do so 
in accordance with Sec. 350.7(d).
    (4) Section 313 claims shall be sent to the address specified in 
Sec. 350.16 of this regulation.
    (f) Method of choosing generic class or category for sections 303, 
311, 312 and 313. A facility owner or operator claiming chemical 
identity as trade secret should choose a generic class or category for 
the chemical that is structurally descriptive of the chemical.
    (g) If a specific chemical identity is submitted under Title III to 
EPA, or to a State emergency response commission, designated State 
agency, local emergency planning committee or local fire department, 
without asserting a trade secrecy claim, the chemical identity shall be 
considered to have been voluntarily disclosed, and non-trade secret.
    (h) A submitter making a trade secrecy claim under this section 
shall submit to entities other than EPA (e.g., a designated State 
agency, local emergency planning committee and local fire department) 
only the sanitized or public copy of the submission and substantiation.


<R05>
Sec. 350.7

  Substantiating claims of trade secrecy.

    (a) Claims of trade secrecy must be substantiated by providing a 
specific answer including, where applicable, specific facts, to each of 
the following questions with the submission to which the trade secrecy 
claim pertains. Submitters must answer these questions on the form 
entitled ``Substantiation to Accompany Claims of Trade Secrecy'' in 
Sec. 350.27 of this subpart.
    (1) Describe the specific measures you have taken to safeguard the 
confidentiality of the chemical identity claimed as trade secret, and 
indicate whether these measures will continue in the future.
    (2) Have you disclosed the information claimed as trade secret to 
any other person (other than a member of a local emergency planning 
committee, officer or employee of the United States or a State or local 
government, or your employee) who is not bound by a confidentiality 
agreement to refrain from disclosing this trade secret information to 
others?
    (3) List all local, State, and Federal government entities to which 
you have disclosed the specific chemical identity. For each, indicate 
whether you asserted a confidentiality claim for the chemical identity 
and whether the government entity denied that claim.
    (4) In order to show the validity of a trade secrecy claim, you must 
identify your specific use of the chemical claimed as trade secret and 
explain why it is a secret of interest to competitors. Therefore:
    (i) Describe the specific use of the chemical claimed as trade 
secret, identifying the product or process in which it is used. (If you 
use the chemical other than as a component of a product

[[Page 449]]

or in a manufacturing process, identify the activity where the chemical 
is used.)
    (ii) Has your company or facility identity been linked to the 
specific chemical identity claimed as trade secret in a patent, or in 
publications or other information sources available to the public or 
your competitors (of which you are aware)? If so, explain why this 
knowledge does not eliminate the justification for trade secrecy.
    (iii) If this use of the chemical claimed as trade secret is unknown 
outside your company, explain how your competitors could deduce this use 
from disclosure of the chemical identity together with other information 
on the Title III submittal form.
    (iv) Explain why your use of the chemical claimed as trade secret 
would be valuable information to your competitors.
    (5) Indicate the nature of the harm to your competitive position 
that would likely result from disclosure of the specific chemical 
identity, and indicate why such harm would be substantial.
    (6)(i) To what extent is the chemical claimed as trade secret 
available to the public or your competitors in products, articles, or 
environmental releases?
    (ii) Describe the factors which influence the cost of determining 
the identity of the chemical claimed as trade secret by chemical 
analysis of the product, article, or waste which contains the chemical 
(e.g., whether the chemical is in pure form or is mixed with other 
substances).
    (b) The answers to the substantiation questions listed in paragraph 
(a) of this section are to be submitted on the form in Sec. 350.27 of 
this subpart, and included with a submitter's trade secret claim.
    (c) An owner, operator or senior official with management 
responsibility shall sign the certification at the end of the form 
contained in Sec. 350.27. The certification in both the sanitized and 
unsanitized versions of the substantiation must bear an original 
signature.
    (d) Claims of confidentiality in the substantiation. (1) The 
submitter may claim as confidential any trade secret or confidential 
business information contained in the substantiation. Such claims for 
material in the substantiation are not limited to claims of trade 
secrecy for specific chemical identity, but may also include claims of 
confidentiality for any confidential business information. To claim this 
material as confidential, the submitter shall clearly designate those 
portions of the substantiation to be claimed as confidential by marking 
those portions ``Confidential,'' or ``Trade Secret.'' Information not so 
marked will be treated as public and may be disclosed without notice to 
the submitter.
    (2) An owner, operator, or senior official with management 
responsibility shall sign the certification stating that those portions 
of the substantiation claimed as confidential would, if disclosed, 
reveal the chemical identity being claimed as a trade secret, or would 
reveal other confidential business or trade secret information. This 
certification is combined on the substantiation form in Sec. 350.27 with 
the certification described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) The submitter shall submit to EPA two copies of the 
substantiation, one of which shall be the unsanitized version, and the 
other shall be the sanitized version.
    (i) The unsanitized copy shall contain all of the information 
claimed as trade secret or business confidential, marked as indicated in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (ii) The second copy shall be identical to the unsanitized 
substantiation except that it will be a sanitized version, in which all 
of the information claimed as trade secret or confidential shall be 
deleted. If any of the information claimed as trade secret in the 
substantiation is the chemical identity which is the subject of the 
substantiation, the submitter shall include the appropriate generic 
class or category of the chemical claimed as trade secret. This 
sanitized copy shall be submitted to the State emergency response 
commission, a designated State agency, the local emergency planning 
committee and the local fire department, as appropriate, and made 
publicly available.
    (e) Supplemental information. (1) EPA may request supplemental 
information from the submitter in support of its trade secret claim, 
pursuant to Sec. 350.11(a)(1). EPA may specify the kind

[[Page 450]]

of information to be submitted, or the submitter may submit any 
additional detailed information which further supports the truth of the 
information previously supplied to EPA in its initial substantiation, 
under this section.
    (2) The submitter may claim as confidential any trade secret or 
confidential business information contained in the supplemental 
information. To claim this material as confidential, the submitter shall 
clearly designate those portions of the supplemental information to be 
claimed as confidential by marking those portions ``Confidential,'' or 
``Trade Secret.'' Information not so marked will be treated as public 
and may be disclosed without notice to the submitter.
    (3) If portions of the supplementary information are claimed 
confidential, an owner, operator, or senior official with management 
responsibility of the submitter shall certify that those portions of the 
supplemental information claimed as confidential would, if disclosed, 
reveal the chemical identity being claimed as confidential or would 
reveal other confidential business or trade secret information.
    (4) If supplemental information is requested by EPA and the 
submitter claims portions of it as trade secret or confidential, then 
the submitter shall submit to EPA two copies of the supplemental 
information, an unsanitized and a sanitized version.
    (i) The unsanitized version shall contain all of the information 
claimed as trade secret or business confidential, marked as indicated 
above in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (ii) The second copy shall be identical to the unsanitized 
substantiation except that it will be a sanitized version, in which all 
of the information claimed as trade secret or confidential shall be 
deleted. If any of the information claimed as trade secret in the 
supplemental information is the chemical identity which is the subject 
of the substantiation, the submitter shall include the appropriate 
generic class or category of the chemical claimed as trade secret.


<R05>
Sec. 350.9  Initial action by EPA.

    (a) When a claim of trade secrecy, made in accordance with 
Sec. 350.5 of this part, is received by EPA, that information is treated 
as confidential until a contrary determination is made.
    (b) A determination as to the validity of a trade secrecy claim 
shall be initiated upon receipt by EPA of a petition under Sec. 350.15 
or may be initiated at any time by EPA if EPA desires to determine 
whether chemical identity information claimed as trade secret is 
entitled to trade secret treatment, even though no request for release 
of the information has been received.
    (c) If EPA initiates a determination as to the validity of a trade 
secrecy claim, the procedures set forth in Secs. 350.11, 350.15, and 
350.17 shall be followed in making the determination.
    (d) When EPA receives a petition requesting disclosure of trade 
secret chemical identity or if EPA decides to initiate a determination 
of the validity of a trade secrecy claim for chemical identity, EPA 
shall first make a determination that the chemical identity claimed as 
trade secret is not the subject of a prior trade secret determination by 
EPA concerning the same submitter and facility, or if it is, that the 
prior determination upheld the submitter's claim of trade secrecy for 
that chemical identity at that facility.
    (1) If EPA determines that the chemical identity claimed as trade 
secret is not the subject of a prior trade secret determination by EPA 
concerning the same submitter and the same facility, or if it is, that 
the prior determination upheld the submitter's claim of trade secrecy, 
then EPA shall review the submitter's claim according to Sec. 350.1l.
    (2) If such a prior determination held that the submitter's claim 
for that chemical identity is invalid, and such determination was not 
challenged by appeal to the General Counsel, or by review in the 
District Court, or, if challenged, was upheld, EPA shall notify the 
submitter by certified mail (return receipt requested) that the chemical 
identity claimed as trade secret is the subject of a prior, final Agency 
determination concerning the same facility in which it was held that 
such a claim was invalid. In this notification EPA shall include notice 
of intent to disclose chemical identity within 10 days pursuant to 
Sec. 350.18(c) of this subpart. EPA shall also notify the petitioner by

[[Page 451]]

regular mail of the action taken pursuant to this section.


<R05>
Sec. 350.11  Review of claim.

    (a) Determination of sufficiency. When EPA receives a petition 
submitted pursuant to Sec. 350.15, or if EPA initiates a determination 
of the validity of a trade secrecy claim for chemical identity, and EPA 
has made a determination, as required in paragraph (d)(1) of Sec. 350.9, 
then EPA shall determine whether the submitter has presented sufficient 
support for its claim of trade secrecy in its substantiation. EPA must 
make such a determination within 30 days of receipt of a petition. A 
claim of trade secrecy for chemical identity will be considered 
sufficient if, assuming all of the information presented in the 
substantiation is true, this supporting information could support a 
valid claim of trade secrecy. A claim is sufficient if it meets the 
criteria set forth in Sec. 350.13.
    (1) Sufficient claim. If the claim meets the criteria of sufficiency 
set forth in Sec. 350.13, EPA shall notify the submitter in writing, by 
certified mail (return receipt requested), that it has 30 days from the 
date of receipt of the notice to submit supplemental information in 
writing in accordance with Sec. 350.7(e), to support the truth of the 
facts asserted in the substantiation. EPA will not accept any 
supplemental information, in response to this notice, submitted after 
the 30 day period has expired. The notice required by this section shall 
include the address to which supplemental information must be sent. The 
notice may specifically request supplemental information in particular 
areas relating to the submitter's claim. The notice must also inform the 
submitter of his right to claim any trade secret or confidential 
business information as confidential, and shall include a reference to 
Sec. 350.7(e) of this regulation as the source for the proper procedure 
for claiming trade secrecy for trade secret or confidential business 
information submitted in the supplemental information requested by EPA.
    (2) Insufficient claim. If the claim does not meet the criteria of 
sufficiency set forth in Sec. 350.13, EPA shall notify the submitter in 
writing of this fact by certified mail (return receipt requested). Upon 
receipt of this notice, the submitter may either file an appeal of the 
matter to the General Counsel under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, 
or, for good cause shown, submit additional material in support of its 
claim of trade secrecy to EPA under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section. The notice required by this section shall include the reasons 
for EPA's decision that the submitter's claim is insufficient, and shall 
inform the submitter of its rights within 30 days of receiving notice to 
file an appeal with EPA's General Counsel or to amend its original 
substantiation for good cause shown. The notice shall include the 
address of the General Counsel, and the address of the office to which 
an amendment for good cause shown should be sent. The notice shall also 
include a reference to Sec. 350.11(a)(2)(i)-(iv) of this subpart as the 
source on the proper procedures for filing an appeal or for amending the 
original substantiation.
    (i) Appeal. The submitter may file an appeal of a determination of 
insufficiency with the General Counsel within 30 days of receipt of the 
notice of insufficiency, in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
Sec. 350.17.
    (ii) Good Cause. In lieu of an appeal to the General Counsel, the 
submitter may send additional material in support of its trade secrecy 
claim, for good cause shown, within 30 days of receipt of the notice of 
insufficiency. To do so, the submitter shall notify EPA by letter of its 
contentions as to good cause, and shall include in that letter the 
additional supporting material.
    (iii) Good cause is limited to one or more of the following reasons:
    (A) The submitter was not aware of the facts underlying the 
additional information at the time the substantiation was submitted, and 
could not reasonably have known the facts at that time; or
    (B) EPA regulations and other EPA guidance did not call for such 
information at the time the substantiation was submitted; or
    (C) The submitter had made a good faith effort to submit a complete 
substantiation, but failed to do so due to an inadvertent omission or 
clerical error.

[[Page 452]]

    (iv) If EPA determines that the submitter has met the standard for 
good cause, then EPA shall decide, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section, whether the submitter's claim meets the Agency's standards of 
sufficiency set forth in Sec. 350.13.
    (A) If after receipt of additional material for good cause, EPA 
decides the claim is sufficient, EPA will determine whether the claim 
presents a valid claim of trade secrecy according to the procedures set 
forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (B) If after receipt of additional material for good cause, EPA 
decides the claim is insufficient, EPA will notify the submitter by 
certified mail (return receipt requested) and the submitter may seek 
review in U.S. District Court within 30 days of receipt of the notice. 
The notice required by this paragraph shall include EPA's reasons for 
its determination, and shall inform the submitter of its right to seek 
review in U.S. District Court within 30 days of receipt of the notice. 
The petitioner shall be notified of EPA's decision by regular mail.
    (v) If EPA determines that the submitter has not met the standard 
for good cause, then EPA shall notify the submitter by certified mail 
(return receipt requested). The submitter may seek review of EPA's 
decision in U.S. District Court within 30 days of receipt of the notice. 
The notice required in this paragraph shall include EPA's reasons for 
its determination, and shall inform the submitter of its right to seek 
review in U.S. District Court within 30 days of receipt of the notice. 
The petitioner shall be notified of EPA's decision by regular mail.
    (b) Determination of trade secrecy. Once a claim has been determined 
to be sufficient under paragraph (a) of this section, EPA must decide 
whether the claim is entitled to trade secrecy.
    (1) If EPA determines that the information submitted in support of 
the trade secrecy claim is true and that the chemical identity is a 
trade secret, the petitioner shall be notified by certified mail (return 
receipt requested) of EPA's determination and may bring an action in 
U.S. District Court within 30 days of receipt of such notice. The notice 
required in this paragraph shall include the reasons why EPA has 
determined that the chemical identity is a trade secret and shall inform 
the petitioner of its right to seek review in U.S. District Court within 
30 days of receipt of the notice. The submitter shall be notified of 
EPA's decision by regular mail.
    (2) If EPA decides that the information submitted in support of the 
trade secrecy claim is not true and that the chemical identity is not a 
trade secret:
    (i) The submitter shall be notified by certified mail (return 
receipt requested) of EPA's determination and may appeal to the General 
Counsel within 30 days of receipt of such notice, in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 350.17. The notice required by this 
paragraph shall include the reasons why EPA has determined that the 
chemical identity is not a trade secret and shall inform the submitter 
of its appeal rights to EPA's General Counsel. The notice shall include 
the address to which an appeal should be sent and the procedure for 
filing an appeal, as set forth in Sec. 350.17(a) of this subpart. The 
petitioner shall be notified of EPA's decision by regular mail.
    (ii) The General Counsel shall notify the submitter by certified 
mail (return receipt requested) of its decision on appeal pursuant to 
the requirements in Sec. 350.17. The notice required by this paragraph 
shall include the reasons for EPA's determination. If the General 
Counsel affirms the decision that the chemical identity is not a trade 
secret, then the submitter shall have 30 days from the date it receives 
notice of the General Counsel's decision to bring an action in U.S. 
District Court. If the General Counsel decides that the chemical 
identity is a trade secret, then EPA shall follow the procedure set 
forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 350.13

  Sufficiency of assertions.

    (a) A substantiation submitted under Sec. 350.7 will be determined 
to be insufficient to support a claim of trade secrecy unless the 
answers to the questions in the substantiation submitted under 
Sec. 350.7 support all of the following conclusions. This substantiation 
must include, where applicable, specific facts.

[[Page 453]]

    (1) The submitter has not disclosed the information to any other 
person, other than a member of a local emergency planning committee, an 
officer or employee of the United States or a State or local government, 
an employee of such person, or a person who is bound by a 
confidentiality agreement, and such person has taken reasonable measures 
to protect the confidentiality of such information and intends to 
continue to take such measures. To support this conclusion, the facts 
asserted must show all of the following:
    (i) The submitter has taken reasonable measures to prevent 
unauthorized disclosure of the specific chemical identity and will 
continue to take such measures.
    (ii) The submitter has not disclosed the specific chemical identity 
to any person who is not bound by an agreement to refrain from 
disclosing the information.
    (iii) The submitter has not previously disclosed the specific 
chemical identity to a local, State, or Federal government entity 
without asserting a confidentiality claim.
    (2) The information is not required to be disclosed, or otherwise 
made available, to the public under any other Federal or State law.
    (3) Disclosure of the information is likely to cause substantial 
harm to the competitive position of such person. To support this 
conclusion, the facts asserted must show all of the following:
    (i) Either: (A) Competitors do not know or the submitter is not 
aware that competitors know that the chemical whose identity is being 
claimed trade secret can be used in the fashion that the submitter uses 
it, and competitors cannot easily duplicate the specific use of this 
chemical through their own research and development activities; or
    (B) Competitors are not aware or the submitter does not know whether 
competitors are aware that the submitter is using this chemical in this 
fashion.
    (ii) The fact that the submitter manufactures, imports or otherwise 
uses this chemical in a particular fashion is not contained in any 
publication or other information source (of which the submitter is 
aware) available to competitors or the public.
    (iii) The non-confidential version of the submission under this 
title does not contain sufficient information to enable competitors to 
determine the specific chemical identity withheld therefrom.
    (iv) The information referred to in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this 
section, is of value to competitors.
    (v) Competitors are likely to use this information to the economic 
detriment of the submitter and are not precluded from doing so by a 
United States patent.
    (vi) The resulting harm to submitter's competitive position would be 
substantial.
    (4) The chemical identity is not readily discoverable through 
reverse engineering. To support this conclusion, the facts asserted must 
show that competitors cannot readily discover the specific chemical 
identity by analysis of the submitter's products or environmental 
releases.
    (b) The sufficiency of the trade secrecy claim shall be decided 
entirely upon the information submitted under Sec. 350.7, or 
Sec. 350.11(a)(2)(ii).


<R05>
Sec. 350.15  Public petitions requesting disclosure of chemical identity claimed as trade secret.

    (a) The public may request the disclosure of chemical identity 
claimed as trade secret by submitting a written petition to the address 
specified in Sec. 350.16.
    (b) The petition shall include:
    (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the petitioner;
    (2) The name and address of the company claiming the chemical 
identity as trade secret; and
    (3) A copy of the submission in which the submitter claimed chemical 
identity as trade secret, with a specific indication as to which 
chemical identity the petitioner seeks disclosed.
    (c) EPA shall acknowledge, by letter to the petitioner, the receipt 
of the petition.
    (d) Incomplete petitions. If the information contained in the 
petition is not sufficient to allow EPA to identify which chemical 
identity the petitioner is seeking to have released, EPA shall

[[Page 454]]

notify the petitioner that the petition cannot be further processed 
until additional information is furnished. EPA will make every 
reasonable effort to assist a petitioner in providing sufficient 
information for EPA to identify the chemical identity the petitioner is 
seeking to have released.
    (e) EPA shall make a determination on a petition requesting 
disclosure, in accordance with Sec. 350.11 and Sec. 350.17, within nine 
months of receipt of such petition.


<R05>
Sec. 350.16   Address to send trade secrecy claims and petitions requesting disclosure.

    All claims of trade secrecy under sections 303(d)(2) and (d)(3), 
311, 312, and 313 and all public petitions requesting disclosure of

mail.
    (c) Appeal of determination of no trade secret. (1) If a submitter 
appeals from a determination by EPA under Sec. 350.11(b)(2) that the 
specific chemical identity at issue is not a trade secret, the General 
Counsel shall make one of the following determinations:
    (i) The assertions supporting the claim of trade secrecy are true 
and the chemical identity is a trade secret; or
    (ii) The assertions supporting the claim of trade secrecy are not 
true and the chemical identity is not a trade secret.
    (2) If the General Counsel reverses the decision made by the EPA 
office handling the claim, the General Counsel shall notify the 
submitter of its determination on appeal in writing, by certified mail 
(return receipt requested). The appeal determination shall include the

The General Counsel shall notify the petitioner by regular mail.


<R05>
Sec. 350.18  Release of chemical identity determined to be non-trade secret; notice of intent to release chemical identity.

    (a) Where a submitter fails to seek review within U.S. District 
Court within 20 days of receiving notice of a determination of the 
General Counsel under Sec. 350.17(b)(3) of this subpart that the trade 
secrecy claim is insufficient, or under Sec. 350.17(c)(3) of this 
subpart that chemical identity claimed as trade secret is not entitled 
to trade secret protection, EPA may furnish notice of intent to disclose 
the chemical identity claimed as trade secret within 10 days by 
furnishing the submitter with the notice set forth in paragraph (d) of 
this section by certified mail (return receipt requested).
    (b) Where a submitter fails to seek review within U.S. District 
Court within 20 days of receiving notice of an EPA determination under 
Sec. 350.11(a)(2)(iv)(B), or Sec. 350.11(a)(2)(v) of this regulation, or 
fails to pursue appeal to the General Counsel within 20 days after being 
notified of its right to do so under Sec. 350.11(a)(2)(i) or 
Sec. 350.11(b)(2)(i), EPA may furnish notice of intent to disclose the 
chemical identity claimed as trade secret within 10 days by furnishing 
the submitter with the notice set forth in paragraph (d) of this section 
by certified mail (return receipt requested).
    (c) Where EPA, upon initial review under Sec. 350.9(d), determines 
that the chemical identity claimed as trade secret in a submittal 
submitted pursuant to this part is the subject of a prior final Agency 
determination concerning a claim of trade secrecy for the same chemical 
identity for the same facility, in which such claim was held invalid, 
EPA shall furnish notice of intent to disclose chemical identity within 
l0 days by furnishing the submitter with the notice set forth in 
paragraph (d) of this section by certified mail (return receipt 
requested).
    (d) EPA shall furnish notice of its intent to release chemical 
identity claimed as trade secret by sending the following notification 
to submitters, under the circumstances set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), 
and (c) of this section. The notice shall state that EPA will make the 
chemical identity available to the petitioner and the public on the 
tenth working day after the date of the submitter's receipt of written 
notice (or on such later date as the Office of General Counsel may 
establish), unless the Office of General Counsel has first been notified 
of the submitter's commencement of an action in Federal court to obtain 
judicial review of the determination at issue, and to obtain preliminary 
injunctive relief against disclosure, or, where applicable, as described 
in paragraph (b) of this section, of commencement of an appeal to the 
General Counsel. The notice shall further state that if Federal court 
action is timely commenced, EPA may nonetheless make the information 
available to the petitioner and the public (in the absence of an order 
by the court to the contrary), once the court has denied a motion for a 
preliminary injunction in the action or has otherwise upheld the EPA 
determination, or, that if Federal court action or appeal to the General 
Counsel is timely commenced, EPA may nonetheless make the information 
available to the petitioner and the public whenever it appears to the 
General

[[Page 456]]

Counsel, after reasonable notice to the submitter, that the submitter is 
not taking appropriate measures to obtain a speedy resolution of the 
action.


<R05>
Sec. 350.19  Provision of information to States.

    (a) Any State may request access to trade secrecy claims, 
substantiations, supplemental substantiations, and additional 
information submitted to EPA. EPA shall release this information, even 
if claimed confidential, to any State requesting access if:
    (1) The request is in writing;
    (2) The request is from the Governor of the State; and
    (3) The State agrees to safeguard the information with procedures 
equivalent to those which EPA uses to safeguard the information.
    (b) The Governor of a State which receives access to trade secret 
information under this section may disclose such information only to 
State employees.


<R05>
Sec. 350.21  Adverse health effects.

    The Governor or State emergency response commission shall identify 
the adverse health effects associated with each of the chemicals claimed 
as trade secret and shall make this information available to the public.

the information might otherwise be entitled to trade secret or 
confidential treatment under this part. Such authority may be exercised 
only in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b)(1) A person under contract or subcontract to EPA or a grantee 
who performs work for EPA in connection with Title III or regulations 
which implement Title III may be considered an authorized representative 
of the United States for purposes of this Sec. 350.23. Subject to the 
limitations in this Sec. 350.23(b), information to which this section 
applies may be disclosed to such a person if the EPA program office 
managing the contract, subcontract, or grant first determines in writing 
that such disclosure is necessary in order that the contractor,

  Instructions for Completing the EPA Trade Secret Substantiation Form

                           General Information

    EPA requires that the information requested in a trade secret 
substantiation be completed using this substantiation form in order to 
ensure that all facility and chemical identifier information, 
substantiation questions, and certification statements are completed. 
Submitter-devised forms will not be accepted. Incomplete substantiations 
will in all likelihood be found insufficient to support the claim, and 
the claim will be denied. Moreover, the statute provides that a 
submitter who fails to provide information required will be subject to a 
$10,000 fine. For the submitter's own protection, therefore, the EPA 
form must be used and completed in its entirety.
    The statute for section 322 establishes a two-phase process in which 
the submitter must do the following:
    1. At the time a report is submitted, the submitter must present a 
complete set of assertions that (if true) would be sufficient to justify 
the claim of trade secrecy; and
    2. If the claim is reviewed by EPA, the submitter will be asked to 
provide additional factual information sufficient to establish the 
truthfulness of the assertions made at the time the claim was made.
    In making its assertions of trade secrecy, a submitter should 
provide, where applicable, descriptive factual statements. Conclusory 
statements of compliance (such as positive or negative restatements of 
the questions) may not provide EPA with enough information to make a 
determination and may be found insufficient to support a claim.

                          What May Be Withheld

    Only the specific chemical identity required to be disclosed in 
sections 303, 311, 312, and 313 submissions may be claimed trade secret 
on the Title III submittal itself. (Other trade secret or confidential 
business information included in answer to a question on the 
substantiation may be claimed trade secret or confidential, as described 
below.)
    Location information claimed as confidential under section 
312(d)(2)(F) should not be sent to EPA; this should only be sent to the 
SERC, LEPC, and the fire department, as requested.

                    Sanitized and Unsanitized Copies

    You must submit this form to EPA in sanitized and unsanitized 
versions, along with the sanitized and unsanitized copies of the 
submittal that gives rise to this trade secrecy claim (except for the 
section 303 submittal, and for MSDSs under section 311). The unsanitized 
version of this form contains specific chemical identity and CAS number 
and may contain other trade secret or confidential business information, 
which should be clearly labeled as such. Failure to claim other 
information trade secret or confidential will make that information 
publicly available. In the sanitized version of this form, the specific 
chemical identity and CAS number must be replaced with the chemical's 
generic class or category and any other trade secret or confidential 
business information should be deleted. You should also send sanitized 
copies of the submittal and this form to relevant State and local 
authorities.
    Each question on this form must be answered. Submitters are 
encouraged to answer in the space provided. If you need more space to 
answer a particular question, please use additional sheets. If you use 
additional sheets, be sure to include the number (and if applicable, the 
subpart) of the question being answered and write your facility's Dun 
and Bradstreet Number on the lower right-hand corner of each sheet.

                    When the Forms Must be Submitted

    The sanitized and unsanitized report forms and trade secret 
substantiations must be submitted to EPA by the normal reporting 
deadline for that section (e.g., section 313 submissions for any 
calendar year must be submitted on or before July 1 of the following 
year).

[[Page 464]]

                  Where to Send the Trade Secrecy Claim

    All trade secrecy claims should be sent to the following address: 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Emergency Planning and Community 
Right-to-Know Program, P.O. Box 70266, Washington, DC 20024-0266.
    In addition, you must send sanitized copies of the report form and 
substantiation to relevant State and local authorities. States will 
provide addresses where the copies of the reports are to be sent.

                          Packaging of Claim(s)

    A completed section 322 claim package must include four items, 
packaged in the following order:
    1. An unsanitized trade secret substantiation form.
    2. A sanitized trade secret substantiation form.
    3. An unsanitized 312 or 313 report (it is not necessary to create 
an unsanitized section 303 submittal or MSDS for submission under 
section 311).
    4. A sanitized (public) section 303, 311, 312, or 313 or report.
    It is important to securely fasten together (binder clip or rubber 
band) each of the reporting forms and substantiations for the particular 
chemical being claimed trade secret. This process will make it clear 
that a claim is physically complete when submitted. When submitters 
submit claims for more than one chemical, EPA requests that the four 
parts associated with each chemical be assembled as a set and each set 
for different chemicals be kept separate within the package sent to EPA. 
Following these guidelines permits the Agency to make the appropriate 
determinations of trade secrecy, and to make public only those portions 
of each submittal required to be disclosed.

                How to Obtain Forms and Other Information

    Additional copies of the Trade Secret Substantiation Form may be 
obtained by writing to: Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know 
Program, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, WH-562A, 401 M Street, 
SW., Washington, DC 20460.

        Instructions for Completing Specific Sections of the Form

                     Part 1. Substantiation Category

    1.1 Title III Reporting Section. Check the box corresponding to the 
section for which this particular claim of trade secrecy is being made. 
Checking off more than one box for a claim is not permitted.
    1.2 Reporting Year. Enter the year to which the reported information 
applies, not the year in which you are submitting the report.
    1.3a Sanitized. If this copy of the submission is the ``public'' or 
sanitized version, check this box and complete 1.3.1a. which asks for 
generic class or category. Do not complete the information required in 
the unsanitized box (1.3b.).
    1.3.1a Generic Class or Category. You must complete this if you are 
claiming the specific chemical identity as a trade secret and have 
marked the box in 1.3a. The generic chemical name must be structurally 
descriptive of the chemical.
    1.3b Unsanitized. Check the box if this version of the form contains 
the specific chemical identity or any other trade secret or confidential 
business information.
    1.3.1b CAS Number. You must enter the Chemical Abstract Service 
(CAS) registry number that appears in the appropriate section of the 
rule for the chemical being reported. Use leading place holding zeros. 
If you are reporting a chemical category (e.g., copper compounds), enter 
N/A in the CAS number space.
    1.3.2b Specific Chemical Identity. Enter the name of the chemical or 
chemical category as it is listed in the appropriate section of the 
reporting rule.

               Part 2. Facility Identification Information

    2.1-2.3 Facility Name and Location. You must enter the name of your 
facility (plant site name or appropriate facility designation), street 
address, city, State and ZIP Code in the space provided. You may not use 
a post office box number for this location.

[[Page 465]]

    2.4 Dun and Bradstreet Number. You must enter the number assigned by 
Dun and Bradstreet for your facility or each establishment wthin your 
facility. If the establishment does not have a D & B number, enter N/A 
in the boxes reserved for those numbers. Use leading place holding 
zeros.

              Part 3. Responses to Substantiation Questions

    The six questions posed in this form are based on the four statutory 
criteria found in section 322(b) of Title III. The information you 
submit in response to these questions is the basis for EPA's initial 
determination as to whether the substantiation is sufficient to support 
a claim of trade secrecy. EPA has indicated in Sec. 350.13 of the final 
rule the specific criteria that it regards as the legal basis for 
evaluating whether the answers you have provided are sufficient to 
warrant protection of the chemical identity. You are urged to review 
those criteria before preparing answers to the questions on the form.

                          Part 4. Certification

    An original signature is required for each trade secret 
substantiation submitted to EPA, both sanitized and unsanitized. It 
indicates the submitter is certifying that the particular substantiation 
provided to EPA is complete, true, and accurate, and that it is intended 
to support the specific trade secret claim being made. Noncompliance 
with this certification requirement may jeopardize the trade secret 
claim.
    4.1 Name and Official Title. Print or type the name and title of the 
person who signs the statement at 4.2.
    4.2 Signature. This certification must be signed by the owner or 
operator, or a senior official with management responsibility for the 
person (or persons) completing the form. An original signature is 
required for each trade secret substantiation submitted to EPA, both 
sanitized and unsanitized. Since the certification applies to all 
information supplied on the forms, it should be signed only after the 
substantiation has been completed.
    4.3 Date. Enter the date when the certification was signed.

  Appendix A to Subpart A--Restatement of Torts Section 757, Comment b

    b. Definition of trade secret. A trade secret may consist of any 
formula, pattern, device or compilation of information which is used in 
one's business, and which gives him an opportunity to obtain an 
advantage over competitors who do not know or use it. It may be a 
formula for a chemical compound, a process of manufacturing, treating or 
preserving materials, a pattern for a machine or other device, or a list 
of customers. It differs from other secret information in a business 
(see section 759) in that it is not simply information as to single or 
ephemeral events in the conduct of the business, as, for example, the 
amount or other terms of a secret bid for a contract or the salary of 
certain employees, or the security investments made or contemplated, or 
the date fixed for the announcement of a new policy or for bringing out 
a new model or the like. A trade secret is a process or device for 
continuous use in the operation of the business. Generally it relates to 
the production of goods, as, for example, a machine or formula for the 
production of an article. It may, however, relate to the sale of goods 
or to other operations in the business, such as a code for determining 
discounts, rebates or other concessions in a price list or catalogue, or 
a list of specialized customers, or a method of bookkeeping or other 
office management.
    Secrecy. The subject matter of a trade secret must be secret. 
Matters of public knowledge or of general knowledge in an industry 
cannot be appropriated by one as his secret. Matters which are 
completely disclosed by the goods which one markets cannot be his 
secret. Substantially, a trade secret is known only in the particular 
business in which it is used. It is not requisite that only the 
proprietor of the business know it. He may, without losing his 
protection, communicate it to employees involved in its use. He may 
likewise communicate it to others pledged to secrecy. Others may also 
know of it independently, as, for example, when they have discovered the 
process or formula by independent invention and are keeping it secret. 
Nevertheless, a substantial element of secrecy must exist, so that, 
except by the use of improper means, there would be difficulty in 
acquiring the information. An exact definition of a trade secret is not 
possible. Some factors to be considered in determining whether given 
information is one's trade secret are: (1) The extent to which the 
information is known outside of his business; (2) the extent to which it 
is known by employees and others involved in his business; (3) the 
extent of measures taken by him to guard the secrecy of the information; 
(4) the value of the information to him and to his competitors; (5) the 
amount of effort or

[[Page 466]]

money expended by him in developing the information; (6) the ease or 
difficulty with which the information could be properly acquired or 
duplicated by others.
    Novelty and prior art. A trade secret may be a device or process 
which is patentable; but it need not be that. It may be a device or 
process which is clearly anticipated in the prior art or one which is 
merely a mechanical improvement that a good mechanic can make. Novelty 
and invention are not requisite for a trade secret as they are for 
patentability. These requirements are essential to patentability because 
a patent protects against unlicensed use of the patented device or 
process even by one who discovers it properly through independent 
research. The patent monopoly is a reward to the inventor. But such is 
not the case with a trade secret. Its protection is not based on a 
policy of rewarding or otherwise encouraging the development of secret 
processes or devices. The protection is merely against breach of faith 
and reprehensible means of learning another's secret. For this limited 
protection it is not appropriate to require also the kind of novelty and 
invention which is a requisite of patentability. The nature of the 
secret is, however, an important factor in determining the kind of 
relief that is appropriate against one who is subject to liability under 
the rule stated in this section. Thus, if the secret consists of a 
device or process which is a novel invention, one who acquires the 
secret wrongfully is ordinarily enjoined from further use of it and is 
required to account for the profits derived from his past use. If, on 
the other hand, the secret consists of mechanical improvements that a 
good mechanic can make without resort to the secret, the wrongdoer's 
liability may be limited to damages, and an injunction against future 
use of the improvements made with the aid of the secret may be 
inappropriate.

Sec. 355.30  Emergency planning.

    (a) Applicability. The requirements of this section apply to any 
facility at which there is present an amount of any extremely hazardous 
substance equal to or in excess of its threshold planning quantity, or 
designated, after public notice and opportunity for comment, by the 
Commission or the Governor for the State in which the facility is 
located. For purposes of this section, an amount of any extremely 
hazardous substance means the total amount of an extremely hazardous 
substance present at any one time at a facility at concentrations 
greater than one percent by weight, regardless of location, number of 
containers, or method of storage.
    (b) Emergency planning notification. The owner or operator of a 
facility subject to this section shall provide notification to the 
Commission that it is a facility subject to the emergency planning 
requirements of this part. Such notification shall be provided: on or 
before May 17, 1987 or within sixty days after a facility first becomes 
subject to the requirements of this section, whichever is later.

[[Page 470]]

    (c) Facility emergency coordinator. The owner or operator of a 
facility subject to this section shall designate a facility 
representative who will participate in the local emergency planning 
process as a facility emergency response coordinator. The owner or 
operator shall notify the local emergency planning committee (or the 
Governor if there is no committee) of the facility representative on or 
before September 17, 1987 or 30 days after establishment of a local 
emergency planning committee, whichever is earlier.
    (d) Provision of information. (1) The owner or operator of a 
facility subject to this section shall inform the local emergency 
planning committee of any changes occurring at the facility which may be 
relevant to emergency planning.
    (2) Upon request of the local emergency planning committee, the 
owner or operator of a facility subject to this section shall promptly 
provide to the committee any information necessary for development or 
implementation of the local emergency plan.
    (e) Calculation of TPQs for solids and mixtures. (1) If a container 
or storage vessel holds a mixture or solution of an extremely hazardous 
substance, then the concentration of extremely hazardous substance, in 
weight percent (greater than 1 percent sign), shall be multiplied by the 
mass (in pounds) in the vessel to determine the actual quantity of 
extremely hazardous substance therein.
    (2)(i) Extremely hazardous substances that are solids are subject to 
either of two threshold planning quantities as shown on appendices A and 
B (i.e., 500/10,000 pounds). The lower quantity applies only if the 
solid exists in powdered form and has a particle size less than 100 
microns; or is handled in solution or in molten form; or meets the 
criteria for a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) rating of 2, 
3 or 4 for reactivity. If the solid does not meet any of these criteria, 
it is subject to the upper (10,000 pound) threshold planning quantity as 
shown in appendices A and B.
    (ii) The 100 micron level may be determined by multiplying the 
weight percent of solid with a particle size less than 100 microns in a 
particular container by the quantity of solid in the container.
    (iii) The amount of solid in solution may be determined by 
multiplying the weight percent of solid in the solution in a particular 
container by the quantity of solution in the container.
    (iv) The amount of solid in molten form must be multipled by 0.3 to 
determine whether the lower threshold planning quantity is met.

Sec. 355.40  Emergency release notification.

    (a) Applicability. (1) The requirements of this section apply to any 
facility: (i) at which a hazardous chemical is produced, used or stored 
and (ii) at which there is release of a reportable quantity of any 
extremely hazardous substance or CERCLA hazardous substance.
    (2) This section does not apply to:
    (i) Any release which results in exposure to persons solely within 
the boundaries of the facility;
    (ii) Any release which is a federally permitted release as defined 
in section 101 (10) of CERCLA;
    (iii) Any release that is continuous and stable in quantity and rate 
under the definitions in 40 CFR 302.8(b). Exemption from notification 
under this subsection does not include exemption from:
    (A) Initial notifications as defined in 40 CFR 302.8 (d) and (e);
    (B) Notification of a ``statistically significant increase,'' 
defined in 40 CFR 302.8(b) as any increase above the upper bound of the 
reported normal range, which is to be submitted to the community 
emergency coordinator for the local emergency planning committee for any 
area likely to be affected by the release and to the State emergency 
response commission of any State likely to be affected by the release;
    (C) Notification of a ``new release'' as defined in 40 CFR 
302.8(g)(1); or
    (D) Notification of a change in the normal range of the release as 
required under 40 CFR 302.8(g)(2).
    (iv) Any release of a pesticide product exempt from CERCLA section 
103(a) reporting under section 103(e) of CERCLA;
    (v) Any release not meeting the definition of release under Section 
101(22)

[[Page 471]]

of CERCLA, and therefore exempt from Section 103(a) reporting; and
    (vi) Any radionuclide release which occurs (A) naturally in soil 
from land holdings such as parks, golf courses, or other large tracts of 
land; (B) naturally from the disturbance of land for purposes other than 
mining, such as for agricultural or construction activities; (C) from 
the dumping of coal and coal ash at utility and industrial facilities 
with coal-fired boilers; and (D) from coal and coal ash piles at utility 
and industrial facilities with coal-fired boilers.

    Note to paragraph (a): Releases of CERCLA hazardous substances are 
subject to the release reporting requirements of CERCLA section 103, 
codified at 40 CFR part 302, in addition to the requirements of this 
part.

    (b) Notice requirements. (1) The owner or operator of a facility 
subject to this section shall immediately notify the community emergency 
coordinator for the local emergency planning committee of any area 
likely to be affected by the release and the State emergency response 
commission of any State likely to be affected by the release. If there 
is no local emergency planning committee, notification shall be provided 
under this section to relevant local emergency response personnel.
    (2) The notice required under this section shall include the 
following to the extent known at the time of notice and so long as no 
delay in notice or emergency response results:
    (i) The chemical name or identity of any substance involved in the 
release.
    (ii) An indication of whether the substance is an extremely 
hazardous substance.
    (iii) An estimate of the quantity of any such substance that was 
released into the environment.
    (iv) The time and duration of the release.
    (v) The medium or media into which the release occurred.
    (vi) Any known or anticipated acute or chronic health risks 
associated with the emergency and, where appropriate, advice regarding 
medical attention necessary for exposed individuals.
    (vii) Proper precautions to take as a result of the release, 
including evacuation (unless such information is readily available to 
the community emergency coordination pursuant to the emergency plan).
    (viii) The names and telephone number of the person or persons to be 
contacted for further information.
    (3) As soon as practicable after a release which requires notice 
under (b)(1) of this section, such owner or operator shall provide a 
written follow-up emergency notice (or notices, as more information 
becomes available) setting forth and updating the information required 
under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and including additional 
information with respect to:
    (i) Actions taken to respond to and contain the release,
    (ii) Any known or anticipated acute or chronic health risks 
associated with the release, and,
    (iii) Where appropriate, advice regarding medical attention 
necessary for exposed individuals.
    (4) Exceptions. (i) Until April 30, 1988, in lieu of the notice 
specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any owner or operator of 
a facility subject to this section from which there is a release of a 
CERCLA hazardous substance which is not an extremely hazardous substance 
and has a statutory reportable quantity may provide the same notice 
required under CERCLA section 103(a) to the local emergency planning 
committee.
    (ii) An owner or operator of a facility from which there is a 
transportation-related release may meet the requirements of this section 
by providing the information indicated in paragraph (b)(2) to the 911 
operator, or in the absence of a 911 emergency telephone number, to the 
operator. For purposes of this paragraph, a transportation-related 
release means a release during transportation, or storage incident to

a This chemical does not meet acute toxicity criteria. Its TPQ is set at 10,000 pounds.                         
b This material is a reactive solid. The TPQ does not default to 10,000 pounds for non-powder, non-molten,      
  nonsolution form.                                                                                             
c The calculated TPQ changed after technical review as described in the technical support document.             
d Indicates that the RQ is subject to change when the assessment of potential carcinogenicity and/or other      
  toxicity is completed.

g New chemicals added that were not part of the original list of 402 substances.                                
h Revised TPQ based on new or re-evaluated toxicity data.                                                       
j TPQ is revised to its calculated value and does not change due to technical review as in proposed rule.       
k The TPQ was revised after proposal due to calculation error.                                                  
l Chemicals on the original list that do not meet toxicity criteria but because of their high production volume 
  and recognized toxicity are considered chemicals of concern (``Other chemicals'').

a This chemical does not meet acute toxicity criteria. Its TPQ is set at
  10,000 pounds.                                                        
b This material is a reactive solid. The TPQ does not default to 10,000 
  pounds for non-powder, non-molten, non-solution form.                 
c The calculated TPQ changed after technical review as described in the 
  technical support document.                                           
d Indicates that the RQ is subject to change when the assessment of     
  potential carcinogenicity and/or other toxicity is completed.         
e Statutory reportable quantity for purposes of notification under SARA 
  sect 304(a)(2).

  technical review as in proposed rule.                                 
k The TPQ was revised after proposal due to calculation error.          
l Chemicals on the original list that do not meet toxicity criteria but 
  because of their high production volume and recognized toxicity are   
  considered chemicals of concern (``Other chemicals'').

                       Physical and Health Hazards

    Descriptions, Amounts, and Locations This section requires aggregate 
information on chemicals by hazard categories as defined in 40 CFR 
370.2. The two health hazard categories and three physical hazard 
categories are a consolidation of the 23 hazard categories defined in 
the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, 29 CFR 1910.1200. For each 
hazard type, indicate the total amounts and general locations of all 
applicable chemicals present at your facility during the past year.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> What units should I use?
    Calculate all amounts as weight in pounds. To convert gas or liquid 
volume to weight in pounds, multiply by an appropriate density factor.

                              Instructions

  Please Read These Instructions Carefully. Print or Type all Responses

    <bullet>What about mixtures?
    If a chemical is part of a mixture, you have the option of reporting 
either the weight of the entire mixture or only the portion of the 
mixture that is a particular hazardous chemical (e.g., if a hazardous 
solution weighs 100 lbs. but is composed of only 5% of a particular 
hazardous chemical, you can indicate either 100 lbs. of the mixture of 5 
lbs. of the hazardous chemical).
    The option used for each mixture must be consistent with the option 
used in your Section 311 reporting.
    Because EHSs are important to Section 303 planning, EHSs have lower 
thresholds. The amount of an EHS at a facility (both pure EHS substances 
and EHSs in mixtures) must be aggregated for purposes of threshold 
determination. It is suggested that the aggregation calculation be done 
as a first step in making the threshold determination. Once you 
determine whether a threshold has been reached for an EHS, you should 
report either the total weight of the EHS at your facility, or the 
weight of each mixture containing the EHs.
    <bullet>Where do I count a chemical that is a fire and reactive 
physical hazard and an immediate (acute) health hazard?
    Add the chemical's weight to your totals for all three hazard 
categories and include its location in all three categories. Many 
chemicals fall into more than one hazard category.

                             Maximum Amount

    The amounts of chemicals you have on hand may vary throughout the 
year. The peak weights--greatest single-day weights during the year--are 
added together in this column to determine the maximum weight for each 
hazard type. Since the peaks for different chemicals often occur on 
different days, this maximum amount will seem artificially high.
    To complete this and the following sections, you may choose to use 
the Tier Two form as a worksheet.
    To determine the Maximum Amount:
    1. List all of your reportable hazardous chemicals individually.
    2. For each chemical . . .
    a. Indicate all physical and health hazards that the chemical 
presents. Include all chemicals, even if they are present for only a 
short period of time during the year.
    b. Estimate the maximum weight in pounds that was present at your 
facility on any single day of the reporting period.
    3. For each hazard type--beginning with Fire and repeating for all 
physical and health hazard types . . .

[[Page 505]]

    a. Add the maximum weights of all chemicals you indicated as the 
particular hazard type.
    b. Look at the Reporting Ranges at the bottom of the Tier One form. 
Find the appropriate range value code.
    c. Enter this range value as the Maximum Amount.
    Example: You are using the Tier Two form as a worksheet and have 
listed raw weights in pounds for each of your hazardous chemicals. You 
have marked an X in the immediate (acute) hazard column for phenol and 
sulfuric acid. The maximum amount raw weight you listed were 10,000 lbs. 
and 500 lbs. respectively. You add these together to reach a total of 
10,500 lbs. Then you look at the Reporting Range at the bottom of your 
Tier One form and find that the value of 04 corresponds to 10,500 lbs. 
Enter 04 as your Maximum Amount for Immediate (acure) hazards materials.
    You also marked an X in the Fire hazard box for phenol. When you 
calculate your Maximum Amount totals for fire hazards, add the 10,000 
lb. weight again.

                          Average Daily Amount

    This column should represent the average daily amount of chemicals 
of each hazard type that were present at or above applicable thresholds 
at your facility at any point during the year.
    To determine this amount:
    1. List all of your reportable hazardous chemicals individually 
(same as for Maximum Amount).
    2. For each chemical . . .
    a. Indicate all physical and health hazards that the chemical 
presents (same as for Maximum Amount).
    b. Estimate the average weight in pounds that was present at your 
facility throughout the year. To do this, total all daily weights and 
divide by the number of days the chemical was present on the site.
    3. For each hazard type--beginning with Fire and repeating for all 
physical and health hazards . . .
    a. Add the average weights of all chemicals you indicated for the 
particular hazard type.
    b. Look at the Reporting Ranges at the bottom of the Tier One form. 
Find the appropriate range value code.
    c. Enter this range value as the Average Daily Amount.

                              Instructions

  Please Read These Instructions Carefully. Print or Type all Responses

    Example: You are using the Tier Two form, and have marked an X in 
the immediate (acute) hazard column for nicotine and phenol. Nicotine is 
present at your facility 100 days during the year, and the sum of the 
daily weights is 100,000 lbs. By dividing 100,000 lbs. by 100 days on-
site, you calculate an Average Daily Amount of 1,000 lbs. for nicotine. 
Phenol is present at your facility 50 days during the year, and the sum 
of the daily weights is 10,000 lbs. By dividing 10,000 lbs. by 50 days 
on-site, you calculate an Average Daily Amount of 200 lbs. for phenol. 
You then add the two average daily amounts together to reach a total of 
1,200 lbs. Then you look at the Reporting Range on your Tier One form 
and find that the value 03 corresponds to 1,200 lbs. Enter 03 as your 
Average Daily Amount for Immediate (acute) Hazard.
    You also marked an X in the Fire hazard column for phenol. When you 
calculate your Average Daily Amount for fire hazards, use the 200 lb. 
weight again.

                         Number of Days On-Site

    Enter the greatest number of days that a single chemical within that 
hazard category was present on-site.
    Example: At your facility, nicotine is present for 100 days and 
phosgene is present for 150 days. Enter 150 in the space provided.

                            General Location

    Enter the general location within your facility where each hazard 
may be found. General locations should include the names or 
identifications of buildings, tank fields, lots, sheds, or other such 
areas.
    For each hazard type, list the locations of all applicable 
chemicals. As an alternative you may also attach a site plan and list 
the site coordinates related to the appropriate locations. If you do so, 
check the Site Plan box.

[[Page 506]]

    Example: On your worksheet you have marked an X in the Fire hazard 
column for acetone and butane. You noted that these are kept in steel 
drums in Room C of the Main Building, and in pressurized cylinders in 
Storage Shed 13, respectively. You could enter Main Building and Storage 
Shed 13 as the General Locations of your fire hazards. However, you 
choose to attach a site plan and list coordinates. Check the Site Plan 
box at the top of the column and enter site coordinates for the Main 
Building and Storage Shed 13 under General Locations.
    If you need more space to list locations, attach an additional Tier 
One form and continue your list on the proper line. Number all pages.

You Must Provide All Information Requested on This Form to Fulfill Tier 
                       Two Reporting Requirements

    This form may also be used as a worksheet for completing the Tier 
One form or may be submitted in place of the Tier One form.

                        Who Must Submit This Form

    Section 312 of Title III requires that the owner or operator of a 
facility submit this Tier Two form if so requested by a State emergency 
response commission, a local emergency planning committee, or a fire 
department with jurisdiction over the facility.
    This request may apply to the owner or operator of any facility that 
is required, under regulations implementing the Occupational Safety and 
Health Act of 1970, to prepare or have available a Material Safety Data 
Sheet (MSDS) for a hazardous chemical present at the facility. MSDS 
requirements are specified in the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) Hazard Communication Standard, found in Title 29 
of the Code of Federal Regulations at Sec. 1910.1200.
    This form does not have to be submitted if all of the chemicals 
located at your facility are excluded under Section 311(e) of Title III.

                       What Chemicals are Included

    If you are submitting Tier Two forms in lieu of Tier One, you must 
report the required information on this Tier Two form for each hazardous 
chemical present at your facility in quantities equal to or greater than 
established threshold amounts (discussed below), unless the chemicals 
are excluded under Section 311(e) of Title III. Hazardous chemicals are 
any substance for which your facility must maintain an MSDS under OSHA's 
Hazard Communication Standard.
    If you elect to submit Tier One rather than Tier Two, you may still 
be required to submit Tier Two information upon request.

                       What Chemicals are Excluded

    Section 311(e) of Title III excludes the following substances:
    (i) Any food, food additive, color additive, drug, or cosmetic 
regulated by the Food and Drug Administration;
    (ii) Any substance present as a solid in any manufactured item to 
the extent exposure to the substance does not occur under normal 
conditions of use;
    (iii) Any substance to the extent it is used for personal, family, 
or household purposes, or is present in the same form and concentration 
as a product packaged for distribution and use by the general public;
    (iv) Any substance to the extent it is used in a research laboratory 
or a hospital or other medical facility under

[[Page 510]]

the direct supervision of a technically qualified individual;
    (v) Any substance to the extent it is used in routine agricultural 
operations or is a fertilizer held for sale by a retailer to the 
ultimate customer.
    OSHA regulations, Sec. 1910.1200(b), stipulate exemptions from the 
requirement to prepare or have available an MSDS.

                          Reporting Thresholds

    Minimum thresholds have been established for Tier One/Tier Two 
reporting under Title III, Section 312. These thresholds are as follows:
    For Extremely Hazardous Substances (EHSs) designated under section 
302 of Title III, the reporting threshold is 500 pounds (or 227 kg.) or 
the threshold planning quantity (TPQ), whichever is lower;
    For all other hazardous chemicals for which facilities are required 
to have or prepare an MSDS, the minimum reporting threshold is 10,000 
pounds (or 4,540 kg.).
    You need to report hazardous chemicals that were present at your 
facility at any time during the previous calendar year at levels that 
equal or exceed these thresholds. For instructions on threshold 
determinations for components of mixtures, see ``What About Mixtures?'' 
on page 2 of these instructions.
    A requesting official may limit the responses required under Tier 
Two by specifying particular chemicals or groups of chemicals. Such 
requests apply to hazardous chemicals regardless of established 
thresholds.

appropriate).
    Enter the full street address or state road. If a street address is 
not available, enter other appropriate identifiers that describe the 
physical location of your facility (e.g., longitude and latitude). 
Include city, county, state, and zip code.
    Enter the primary Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code and 
the Dun & Bradstreet number for your facility. The financial officer of 
your facility should be able to provide the Dun & Bradstreet number. If 
your firm does not have this information, contact the State or regional 
office of Dun & Bradstreet to obtain your facility number or have one 
assigned.

[[Page 511]]

                             Owner/Operator

    Enter the owner's or operator's full name, mailing address, and 
phone number.

                            Emergency Contact

    Enter the name, title, and work phone number at least one local 
person or office who can act as a referral if emergency responders need 
assistance in responding to a chemical accident at the facility.
    Provide an emergency phone number where such emergency information 
will be available 24 hours a day, every day. The requirement is 
mandatory. The facility must make some arrangement to ensure a 24 hour 
contact is available.

                          Identical Information

    Check the box indicating indentical information, located below the 
emergency contacts on the Tier Two form, if the current chemical 
information being reported is identical to that submitted last year. 
Chemical descriptions, hazards, amounts, and locations must be provided 
in this year's form, even if the information is identical to that 
submitted last year.

   Chemical Information: Description, Hazards, Amounts, and Locations

    The main section of the Tier Two form requires specific information 
on amounts and locations of hazardous chemicals, as defined in the OSHA 
Hazard Communication Standard.
    If you choose to indicate that all of the information on a specific 
hazardous chemical is identical to that submitted last year, check the 
appropriate optional box provided at the right side of the storage codes 
and locations on the Tier Two form. Chemical descriptions, hazards, 
amounts, and locations must be provided even if the information is 
identical to that submitted last year.
    <bullet> What units should I use?
    Calculate all amounts as weight in pounds. To convert gas or liquid 
volume to weight in pounds, multiply by an appropriate density factor.
    <bullet> What about mixtures?
    If a chemical is part of a mixture, you have the option of reporting 
either the weight of the entire mixture or only the portion of the 
mixuture that is a particular hazardous chemical (e.g., if a hazardous 
solution weights 100 lbs. but is composed of only 5% of a particular 
hazardous chemical, you can indicate either 100 lbs. of the mixture or 5 
lbs. of the chemical).
    The option used for each mixture must be consistent with the option 
used in your Section 311 reporting.
    Because EHSs are important to Section 303 planning, EHSs have lower 
thresholds. The amount of an EHS at a facility (both pure EHS substances 
and EHSs in mixtures) must be aggregated and purposes of threshold 
determination. It is suggested that the aggregation calculation be done 
as a first step in making the threshold determination. Once you 
determine whether a threshold for an EHS has been reached, you should 
report either the total weight of the EHS at your facility, or the 
weight of each mixture containing the EHS.

                          Chemical Description

    1. Enter the Chemical Abstract Service registry number (CAS). For 
mixtures, enter the CAS number of the mixture as a whole if it has been 
assigned a number distinct from its constituents. For a mixture that has 
no CAS number, leave this item blank or report the CAS numbers of as 
many constituent chemicals as possible.
    If you are withholding the name of a chemical in accordance with 
criteria specified in Title III, Section 322, enter the generic class or 
category that is structurally descriptive of the chemical (e.g., list 
toulene diisocyanate as organic isocyanate) and check the box marked 
Trade Secret. Trade secret information should be submitted to EPA and 
must include a substantiation. Please refer to EPA's final regulation on 
trade secrecy (53 FR 28772, July 29, 1988) for detailed information on 
how to submit trade secrecy claims.
    2. Enter the chemical name or common name of each hazardous 
chemical.
    3. Check box for ALL applicable descriptors: pure or mixture; and 
solid, liquid, or gas; and whether the chemical is or contains an EHS.
    4. If the chemical is a mixture containing an EHS, enter the 
chemical name of each EHS in the mixture.

[[Page 512]]

    Example: You have pure chlorine as on hand, as well as two mixtures 
that contain liquid chlorine. You write ``chlorine'' and enter the CAS 
number. Then you check ``pure'' and ``mix''--as well as ``liquid'' and 
``gas''.

                       Physical and Health Hazards

    For each chemical you have listed, check all the physical and health 
hazard boxes that apply. These hazard categories are defined in 40 CFR 
370.2. The two health hazard categories and three physical hazard 
categories are a consolidation of the 23 hazard categories defined in 
the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, 29 CFR 1910.1200.

    Maximum Amount
    1. For each hazardous chemical, estimate the greatest amount present 
at your facility on any single day during the reporting period.
    2. Find the appropriate range value code in Table I.
    3. Enter this range value as the Maximum Amount.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If you are using this form as a worksheet for completing Tier One, 
enter the actual weight in pounds in the shaded space below the response 
blocks. Do this for both Maximum Amount and Average Daily Amount.
    Example: You received one large shipment of a solvent mixture last 
year. The shipment filled five 5,000-gallon storage tanks. You know that 
the solvent contains 10% benzene, which is a hazardous chemical.
    You figure that 10% of 25,000 gallons is 2,500 gallons. You also 
know that the density of benzene is 7.29 pounds per gallon, so you 
multiply 2,500 gallons by 7.29 pounds per gallon to get a weight of 
18,225 pounds.
    Then you look at Table I and find that the range value 04 
corresponds to 18,225. You enter 04 as the Maximum Amount.
    (If you are using the form as a worksheet for completing a Tier One 
form, you should write 18,255 in the shaded area.)

                          Average Daily Amount

    1. For each hazardous chemical, estimate the average weight in 
pounds that was present at your facility during the year.
    To do this, total all daily weights and divide by the number of days 
the chemical was present on the site.
    2. Find the appropriate range value in Table I.
    3. Enter this range value as the Average Daily Amount.
    Example: The 25,000-gallon shipment of solvent you received last 
year was gradually used up and completely gone in 315 days. The sum of 
the daily volume levels in the tank is 4,536,000 gallons. By dividing 
4,536,000 gallons by 315 days on-site, you calculate an average daily 
amount of 14,400 gallons.
    You already know that the solvent contains 10% benzene, which is a 
hazardous chemical. Since 10% of 14,400 is

[[Page 513]]

1,440, you figure that you had an average of 1,440 gallons of benzene. 
You also know that the density of benzene is 7.29 pounds per gallon, so 
you multiply 1,440 by 7.29 to get a weight of 10,500 pounds.
    Then you look at Table I and find that the range value 04 
corresponds to 10,500. You enter 04 as the Average Daily Amount.
    (If you are using the form as a worksheet for completing a Tier One 
form, you should write 10,500 in the shaded area.)

                         Number of Days On-Site

    Enter the number of days that the hazardous chemical was found on-
site.
    Example: The solvent composed of 10% benzene was present for 315 
days at your facility. Enter 315 in the space provided.

                   Storage Codes and Storage Locations

    List all non-confidential chemical locations in this column, along 
with storage types/conditions associated with each location. Please note 
that a particular chemical may be located in several places around the 
facility. Each row of boxes followed by a line represents a unique 
location for the same chemical.
    Storage Codes: Indicate the types and conditions of storage present.
    a. Look at Table II. For each location, find the appropriate storage 
type and enter the corresponding code in the first box.
    b. Look at Table III. For each location, find the appropriate 
storage types for pressure and temperature conditions. Enter the 
applicable pressure code in the second box. Enter the applicable 
temperature code in the third box.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 372.1  Scope and purpose.

    This part sets forth requirements for the submission of information 
relating to the release of toxic chemicals under section 313 of Title 
III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986. The 
information collected under this part is intended to inform the general 
public and the communities surrounding covered facilities about releases 
of toxic chemicals, to assist research, to aid in the development of 
regulations, guidelines, and standards, and for other purposes. This 
part also sets forth requirements for suppliers to notify persons to 
whom they distribute mixtures or trade name products containing toxic 
chemicals that they contain such chemicals.


<R05>
Sec. 372.3  Definitions.

    Terms defined in sections 313(b)(1)(c) and 329 of Title III and not 
explicitly defined herein are used with the meaning given in Title III. 
For the purpose of this part:
    Acts means Title III.
    Article means a manufactured item: (1) Which is formed to a specific 
shape

[[Page 515]]

or design during manufacture; (2) which has end use functions dependent 
in whole or in part upon its shape or design during end use; and (3) 
which does not release a toxic chemical under normal conditions of 
processing or use of that item at the facility or establishments.
    Chief Executive Officer of the tribe means the person who is 
recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs as the chief elected 
administrative officer of the tribe.
    Customs territory of the United States means the 50 States, the 
District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.
    EPA means the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
    Establishment means an economic unit, generally at a single physical 
location, where business is conducted or where services or industrial 
operations are performed.
    Facility means all buildings, equipment, structures, and other 
stationary items which are located on a single site or on contiguous or 
adjacent sites and which are owned or operated by the same person (or by 
any person which controls, is controlled by, or under common control 
with such person). A facility may contain more than one establishment.
    Full-time employee means 2,000 hours per year of full-time 
equivalent employment. A facility would calculate the number of full-
time employees by totaling the hours worked during the calendar year by 
all employees, including contract employees, and dividing that total by 
2,000 hours.
    Import means to cause a chemical to be imported into the customs 
territory of the United States. For purposes of this definition, to 
cause means to intend that the chemical be imported and to control the 
identity of the imported chemical and the amount to be imported.
    Indian Country means Indian country as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151. 
That section defines Indian country as:
    (a) All land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the 
jurisdiction of the United States government, notwithstanding the 
issuance of any patent, and including rights-of-way running through the 
reservation;
    (b) All dependent Indian communities within the borders of the 
United States whether within the original or subsequently acquired 
territory thereof, and whether within or without the limits of a State; 
and
    (c) All Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not been 
extinguished, including rights-of-way running through the same.
    Indian tribe means those tribes federally recognized by the 
Secretary of the Interior.
    Manufacture means to produce, prepare, import, or compound a toxic 
chemical. Manufacture also applies to a toxic chemical that is produced 
coincidentally during the manufacture, processing, use, or disposal of 
another chemical or mixture of chemicals, including a toxic chemical 
that is separated from that other chemical or mixture of chemicals as a 
byproduct, and a toxic chemical that remains in that other chemical or 
mixture of chemicals as an impurity.
    Mixture means any combination of two or more chemicals, if the 
combination is not, in whole or in part, the result of a chemical 
reaction. However, if the combination was produced by a chemical 
reaction but could have been produced without a chemical reaction, it is 
also treated as a mixture. A mixture also includes any combination which 
consists of a chemical and associated impurities.
    Otherwise use or use means any use of a toxic chemical that is not 
covered by the terms manufacture or process and includes use of a toxic 
chemical contained in a mixture or trade name product. Relabeling or 
redistributing a container of a toxic chemical where no repackaging of 
the toxic chemical occurs does not constitute use or processing of the 
toxic chemical.
    Process means the preparation of a toxic chemical, after its 
manufacture, for distribution in commerce:
    (1) In the same form or physical state as, or in a different form or 
physical state from, that in which it was received by the person so 
preparing such substance, or

    (2) As part of an article containing the toxic chemical. Process 
also applies to the processing of a toxic chemical contained in a 
mixture or trade name product.
    Release means any spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, 
emptying, discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping, or 
disposing into the environment (including the abandonment or discarding 
of barrels, containers, and other closed receptacles) of any toxic 
chemical.

responsibility for the person or persons completing the report, or the 
manager of environmental programs for the facility or establishments, or 
for the corporation owning or operating the facility or establishments 
responsible for certifying similar reports under other environmental 
regulatory requirements.
    State means any State of the United States, the District of 
Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the 
United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
Islands, and any other territory or possession over which the United 
States has jurisdiction and Indian Country.
    Title III means Title III of the Superfund Amendments and 
Reauthorization Act of 1986, also titled the Emergency Planning and 
Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986.
    Toxic chemical means a chemical or chemical category listed in 
Sec. 372.65.
    Trade name product means a chemical or mixture of chemicals that is 
distributed to other persons and that incorporates a toxic chemical 
component that is not identified by the applicable chemical name or 
Chemical Abstracts Service Registry number listed in Sec. 372.65.

<R05>
Sec. 372.25  Thresholds for reporting.

    Except as provided in Sec. 372.27, the threshold amounts for 
purposes of reporting under Sec. 372.30 for toxic chemicals are as 
follows:
    (a) With respect to a toxic chemical manufactured (including 
imported) or processed at a facility during the following calendar 
years:

1987--75,000 pounds of the chemical manufactured or processed for the 
year.

[[Page 518]]

1988--50,000 pounds of the chemical manufactured or processed for the 
year.
1989 and thereafter--25,000 pounds of the chemical manufactured or 
processed for the year.

    (b) With respect to a chemical otherwise used at a facility, 10,000 
pounds of the chemical used for the applicable calendar year.
    (c) With respect to activities involving a toxic chemical at a 
facility, when more than one threshold applies to the activities, the 
owner or operator of the facility must report if it exceeds any 
applicable threshold and must report on all activities at the facility 
involving the chemical, except as provided in Sec. 372.38.
    (d) When a facility manufactures, processes, or otherwise uses more 
than one member of a chemical category listed in Sec. 372.65(c), the 
owner or operator of the facility must report if it exceeds any 
applicable threshold for the total volume of all the members of the 
category involved in the applicable activity. Any such report must cover 
all activities at the facility involving members of the category.
    (e) A facility may process or otherwise use a toxic chemical in a 
recycle/reuse operation. To determine whether the facility has processed 
or used more than an applicable threshold of the chemical, the owner or 
operator of the facility shall count the amount of the chemical added to 
the recycle/reuse operation during the calendar year. In particular, if 
the facility starts up such an operation during a calendar year, or in 
the event that the contents of the whole recycle/reuse operation are 
replaced in a calendar year, the owner or operator of the facility shall 
also count the amount of the chemical placed into the system at these 
times.
    (f) A toxic chemical may be listed in Sec. 372.65 with the notation 
that only persons who manufacture the chemical, or manufacture it by a 
certain method, are required to report. In that case, only owners or 
operators of facilities that manufacture that chemical as described in 
Sec. 372.65 in excess of the threshold applicable to such manufacture in 
Sec. 372.25 are required to report. In completing the reporting form, 
the owner or operator is only required to account for the quantity of 
the chemical so manufactured and releases associated with such 
manufacturing, but not releases associated with subsequent processing or 
use of the chemical at that facility. Owners and operators of facilities 
that solely process or use such a chemical are not required to report 
for that chemical.
    (g) A toxic chemical may be listed in Sec. 372.65 with the notation 
that it is in a specific form (e.g., fume or dust, solution, or friable) 
or of a specific color (e.g., yellow or white). In that case, only 
owners or operators of facilities that manufacture, process, or use that 
chemical in the form or of the color, specified in Sec. 372.65 in excess 
of the threshold applicable to such activity in Sec. 372.25 are required 
to report. In completing the reporting form, the owner or operator is 
only required to account for the quantity of the chemical manufactured, 
processed, or used in the form or color specified in Sec. 372.65 and for 
releases associated with the chemical in that form or color. Owners or 
operators of facilities that solely manufacture, process, or use such a 
chemical in a form or color other than those specified by Sec. 372.65 
are not required to report for that chemical.
    (h) Metal compound categories are listed in Sec. 372.65(c). For 
purposes of determining whether any of the thresholds specified in 
Sec. 372.25 are met for metal compound category, the owner or operator 
of a facility must make the threshold determination based on the total 
amount of all members of the metal compound category manufactured, 
processed, or used at the facility. In completing the release portion of 
the reporting form for releases of the metal compounds, the owner or 
operator is only required to account for the weight of the parent metal 
released. Any contribution to the mass of the release attributable to 
other portions of each compound in the category is excluded.

Sec. 372.27   Alternate threshold and certification.

    (a) With respect to the manufacture, process, or otherwise use of a 
toxic chemical, the owner or operator of a facility may apply an 
alternate threshold

[[Page 519]]

of 1 million pounds per year to that chemical if the owner or operator 
calculates that the facility would have an annual reportable amount of 
that toxic chemical not exceeding 500 pounds for the combined total 
quantities released at the facility, disposed within the facility, 
treated at the facility (as represented by amounts destroyed or 
converted by treatment processes), recovered at the facility as a result 
of recycle operations, combusted for the purpose of energy recovery at 
the facility, and amounts transferred from the facility to off-site 
locations for the purpose of recycle, energy recovery, treatment, and/or 
disposal. These volumes correspond to the sum of amounts reportable for 
data elements on EPA Form R (EPA Form 9350-1; Rev. 12/4/93) as Part II 
column B or sections 8.1 (quantity released), 8.2 (quantity used for 
energy recovery on-site), 8.3 (quantity used for energy recovery off-
site), 8.4 (quantity recycled on-site), 8.5 (quantity recycled off-
site), 8.6 (quantity treated on-site), and 8.7 (quantity treated off-
site).
    (b) If an owner or operator of a facility determines that the owner 
or operator may apply the alternate reporting threshold specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section for a specific toxic chemical, the owner 
or operator is not required to submit a report for that chemical under 
Sec. 372.30, but must submit a certification statement that contains the 
information required in Sec. 372.95. The owner or operator of the 
facility must also keep records as specified in Sec. 372.10(d).
    (c) Threshold determination provisions of Sec. 372.25 and exemptions 
pertaining to threshold determinations in Sec. 372.38 are applicable to 
the determination of whether the alternate threshold has been met.
    (d) Each certification statement under this section for activities 
involving a toxic chemical that occurred during a calendar year at a 
facility must be submitted to EPA and to the State in which the facility 
is located on or before July 1 of the next year.

<R05>
Sec. 372.30  Reporting requirements and schedule for reporting.

    (a) For each toxic chemical known by the owner or operator to be 
manufactured (including imported), processed, or otherwise used in 
excess of an applicable threshold quantity in Sec. 372.25 at its covered 
facility described in Sec. 372.22 for a calendar year, the owner or 
operator must submit to EPA and to the State in which the facility is 
located a completed EPA Form R (EPA Form 9350-1) in accordance with the 
instructions referred to in subpart E of this part.
    (b)(1) The owner or operator of a covered facility is required to 
report as described in paragraph (a) of this section on a toxic chemical 
that the owner or operator knows is present as a component of a mixture 
or trade name product which the owner or operator receives from another 
person, if that chemical is imported, processed, or otherwise used by 
the owner or operator in excess of an applicable threshold quantity in 
Sec. 372.25 at the facility as part of that mixture or trade name 
product.
    (2) The owner or operator knows that a toxic chemical is present as 
a component of a mixture or trade name product (i) if the owner or 
operator knows or has been told the chemical identity or Chemical 
Abstracts Service Registry Number of the chemical and the identity or 
Number corresponds to an identity or Number in Sec. 372.65, or (ii) if 
the owner or operator has been told by the supplier of the mixture or 
trade name product that the mixture or trade

[[Page 520]]

name product contains a toxic chemical subject to section 313 of the Act 
or this part.
    (3) To determine whether a toxic chemical which is a component of a 
mixture or trade name product has been imported, processed, or otherwise 
used in excess of an applicable threshold in Sec. 372.25 at the 
facility, the owner or operator shall consider only the portion of the 
mixture or trade name product that consists of the toxic chemical and 
that is imported, processed, or otherwise used at the facility, together 
with any other amounts of the same toxic chemical that the owner or 
operator manufactures, imports, processes, or otherwise uses at the 
facility as follows:
    (i) If the owner or operator knows the specific chemical identity of 
the toxic chemical and the specific concentration at which it is present 
in the mixture or trade name product, the owner or operator shall 
determine the weight of the chemical imported, processed, or otherwise 
used as part of the mixture or trade name product at the facility and 
shall combine that with the weight of the toxic chemical manufactured 
(including imported), processed, or otherwise used at the facility other 
than as part of the mixture or trade name product. After combining these 
amounts, if the owner or operator determines that the toxic chemical was 
manufactured, processed, or otherwise used in excess of an applicable 
threshold in Sec. 372.25, the owner or operator shall report the 
specific chemical identity and all releases of the toxic chemical on EPA 
Form R in accordance with the instructions referred to in subpart E of 
this part.
    (ii) If the owner or operator knows the specific chemical identity 
of the toxic chemical and does not know the specific concentration at 
which the chemical is present in the mixture or trade name product, but 
has been told the upper bound concentration of the chemical in the 
mixture or trade name product, the owner or operator shall assume that 
the toxic chemical is present in the mixture or trade name product at 
the upper bound concentration, shall determine whether the chemical has 
been manufactured, processed, or otherwise used at the facility in 
excess of an applicable threshold as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of 
this section, and shall report as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of 
this section.
    (iii) If the owner or operator knows the specific chemical identity 
of the toxic chemical, does not know the specific concentration at which 
the chemical is present in the mixture or trade name product, has not 
been told the upper bound concentration of the chemical in the mixture 
or trade name product, and has not otherwise developed information on 
the composition of the chemical in the mixture or trade name product, 
then the owner or operator is not required to factor that chemical in 
that mixture or trade name product into threshold and release 
calculations for that chemical.
    (iv) If the owner or operator has been told that a mixture or trade 
name product contains a toxic chemical, does not know the specific 
chemical identity of the chemical and knows the specific concentration 
at which it is present in the mixture or trade name product, the owner 
or operator shall determine the weight of the chemical imported, 
processed, or otherwise used as part of the mixture or trade name 
product at the facility. Since the owner or operator does not know the 
specific identity of the toxic chemical, the owner or operator shall 
make the threshold determination only for the weight of the toxic 
chemical in the mixture or trade name product. If the owner or operator 
determines that the toxic chemical was imported, processed, or otherwise 
used as part of the mixture or trade name product in excess of an 
applicable threshold in Sec. 372.25, the owner or operator shall report 
the generic chemical name of the toxic chemical, or a trade name if the 
generic chemical name is not known, and all releases of the toxic 
chemical on EPA Form R in accordance with the instructions referred to 
in subpart E of this part.
    (v) If the owner or operator has been told that a mixture or trade 
name product contains a toxic chemical, does not know the specific 
chemical identity of the chemical, and does not know the specific 
concentration at which the chemical is present in the mixture or trade 
name product, but has

[[Page 521]]

been told the upper bound concentration of the chemical in the mixture 
or trade name product, the owner or operator shall assume that the toxic 
chemical is present in the mixture or trade name product at the upper 
bound concentration, shall determine whether the chemical has been 
imported, processed, or otherwise used at the facility in excess of an 
applicable threshold as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this 
section, and shall report as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this 
section.
    (vi) If the owner or operator has been told that a mixture or trade 
name product contains a toxic chemical, does not know the specific 
chemical identity of the chemical, does not know the specific 
concentration at which the chemical is present in the mixture or trade 
name product, including information they have themselves developed, and 
has not been told the upper bound concentration of the chemical in the 
mixture or trade name product, the owner or operator is not required to 
report with respect to that toxic chemical.
    (c) A covered facility may consist of more than one establishment. 
The owner or operator of such a facility at which a toxic chemical was 
manufactured (including imported), processed, or otherwise used in 
excess of an applicable threshold may submit a separate Form R for each 
establishment or for each group of establishments within the facility to 
report the activities involving the toxic chemical at each establishment 
or group of establishments, provided that activities involving that 
toxic chemical at all the establishments within the covered facility are 
reported. If each establishment or group of establishments files 
separate reports then for all other chemicals subject to reporting at 
that facility they must also submit separate reports. However, an 
establishment or group of establishments does not have to submit a 
report for a chemical that is not manufactured (including imported), 
processed, otherwise used, or released at that establishment or group of 
establishments.
    (d) Each report under this section for activities involving a toxic 
chemical that occurred during a calendar year at a covered facility must 
be submitted on or before July 1 of the next year. The first such report 
for calendar year 1987 activities must be submitted on or before July 1, 
1988.

<R05>
Sec. 372.38  Exemptions.

    (a) De minimis concentrations of a toxic chemical in a mixture. If a 
toxic chemical is present in a mixture of chemicals at a covered 
facility and the toxic chemical is in a concentration in the mixture 
which is below 1 percent of the mixture, or 0.1 percent of the mixture 
in the case of a toxic chemical which is a carcinogen as defined in 29 
CFR 1910.1200(d)(4), a person is not required to consider the quantity 
of the toxic chemical present in such mixture when determining whether 
an applicable threshold has been met under Sec. 372.25 or determining 
the amount of release to be reported under Sec. 372.30. This exemption 
applies whether the person received the mixture from another person or 
the person produced the mixture, either by mixing the chemicals involved 
or by causing a chemical reaction which resulted in the creation of the 
toxic chemical in the mixture. However, this exemption applies only to 
the quantity of the toxic chemical present in the mixture. If the toxic 
chemical is also manufactured (including imported), processed, or 
otherwise used at the covered facility other than as part of the mixture 
or in a mixture at higher concentrations, in excess of an applicable 
threshold quantity set forth in Sec. 372.25, the person is required to 
report under Sec. 372.30.
    (b) Articles. If a toxic chemical is present in an article at a 
covered facility, a person is not required to consider the quantity of 
the toxic chemical present in such article when determining whether an 
applicable threshold has been met under Sec. 372.25 or determining the 
amount of release to be reported under Sec. 372.30. This exemption 
applies whether the person received the article from another person or 
the person produced the article. However, this exemption applies only to 
the quantity of the toxic chemical present in the article. If the toxic 
chemical is manufactured (including imported), processed,

[[Page 522]]

or otherwise used at the covered facility other than as part of the 
article, in excess of an applicable threshold quantity set forth in 
Sec. 372.25, the person is required to report under Sec. 372.30. Persons 
potentially subject to this exemption should carefully review the 
definitions of article and release in Sec. 372.3. If a release of a 
toxic chemical occurs as a result of the processing or use of an item at 
the facility, that item does not meet the definition of article.
    (c) Uses. If a toxic chemical is used at a covered facility for a 
purpose described in this paragraph (c), a person is not required to 
consider the quantity of the toxic chemical used for such purpose when 
determining whether an applicable threshold has been met under 
Sec. 372.25 or determining the amount of releases to be reported under 
Sec. 372.30. However, this exemption only applies to the quantity of the 
toxic chemical used for the purpose described in this paragraph (c). If 
the toxic chemical is also manufactured (including imported), processed, 
or otherwise used at the covered facility other than as described in 
this paragraph (c), in excess of an applicable threshold quantity set 
forth in Sec. 372.25, the person is required to report under 
Sec. 372.30.
    (1) Use as a structural component of the facility.
    (2) Use of products for routine janitorial or facility grounds 
maintenance. Examples include use of janitorial cleaning supplies, 
fertilizers, and pesticides similar in type or concentration to consumer 
products.
    (3) Personal use by employees or other persons at the facility of 
foods, drugs, cosmetics, or other personal items containing toxic 
chemicals, including supplies of such products within the facility such 
as in a facility operated cafeteria, store, or infirmary.
    (4) Use of products containing toxic chemicals for the purpose of 
maintaining motor vehicles operated by the facility.
    (5) Use of toxic chemicals present in process water and non-contact 
cooling water as drawn from the environment or from municipal sources, 
or toxic chemicals present in air used either as compressed air or as 
part of combustion.
    (d) Activities in laboratories. If a toxic chemical is manufactured, 
processed, or used in a laboratory at a covered facility under the 
supervision of a technically qualified individual as defined in 
Sec. 720.3(ee) of this title, a person is not required to consider the 
quantity so manufactured, processed, or used when determining whether an 
applicable threshold has been met under Sec. 372.25 or determining the 
amount of release to be reported under Sec. 372.30. This exemption does 
not apply in the following cases:
    (1) Specialty chemical production.
    (2) Manufacture, processing, or use of toxic chemicals in pilot 
plant scale operations.
    (3) Activities conducted outside the laboratory.
    (e) Certain owners of leased property. The owner of a covered 
facility is not subject to reporting under Sec. 372.30 if such owner's 
only interest in the facility is ownership of the real estate upon which 
the facility is operated. This exemption applies to owners of facilities 
such as industrial parks, all or part of which are leased to persons who 
operate establishments within SIC code 20 through 39 where the owner has 
no other business interest in the operation of the covered facility.
    (f) Reporting by certain operators of establishments on leased 
property such as industrial parks. If two or more persons, who do not 
have any common corporate or business interest (including common 
ownership or control), operate separate establishments within a single 
facility, each such person shall treat the establishments it operates as 
a facility for purposes of this part. The determinations in Sec. 372.22 
and Sec. 372.25 shall be made for those establishments. If any such 
operator determines that its establishment is a covered facility under 
Sec. 372.22 and that a toxic chemical has been manufactured (including 
imported), processed, or otherwise used at the establishment in excess 
of an applicable threshold in Sec. 372.25 for a calendar year, the 
operator shall submit a report in accordance with Sec. 372.30 for the 
establishment. For purposes of this paragraph (f), a common corporate or 
business interest includes ownership, partnership, joint ventures, 
ownership of a controlling interest in one person

[[Page 523]]

by the other, or ownership of a controlling interest in both persons by 
a third person.

listed in Sec. 372.65 with an effective date of January 1, 1989 or 
later, the person shall provide the written notice described in 
paragraph (b) of this section to each recipient of the mixture or trade 
name product with at least the first shipment of the mixture or trade 
name product to each recipient in each calendar year beginning with the 
applicable effective date.
    (3) If a person changes a mixture or trade name product for which 
notification was previously provided under paragraph (b) of this section 
by adding a toxic chemical, removing a toxic chemical, or changing the 
percent by weight of a toxic chemical in the mixture or trade name 
product, the person shall provide each recipient of the changed mixture 
or trade name product a revised notification reflecting the change with 
the first shipment of the changed mixture or trade name product to the 
recipient.
    (4) If a person discovers (i) that a mixture or trade name product 
previously sold or otherwise distributed to another person during the 
calendar year of the discovery contains one or more toxic chemicals and 
(ii), that any notification provided to such other persons in that 
calendar year for the mixture or trade name product either did not 
properly identify any of the toxic chemicals or did not accurately 
present the percent by weight of any of the toxic chemicals in the 
mixture or trade name product, the person shall provide a new 
notification to the recipient within 30 days of the discovery which 
contains the information described in paragraph (b) of this section and 
identifies the prior shipments of the mixture or product in that 
calendar year to which the new notification applies.
    (5) If a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) is required to be 
prepared and distributed for the mixture or trade name product in 
accordance with 29 CFR 1910.1200, the notification must be attached to 
or otherwise incorporated into such MSDS. When the notification is 
attached to the MSDS, the notice must contain clear instructions that 
the notifications must not be detached

[[Page 524]]

from the MSDS and that any copying and redistribution of the MSDS shall 
include copying and redistribution of the notice attached to copies of 
the MSDS subsequently redistributed.
    (d) Notifications are not required in the following instances:
    (1) If a mixture or trade name product contains no toxic chemical in 
excess of the applicable de minimis concentration as specified in 
Sec. 372.38(a).
    (2) If a mixture or trade name product is one of the following:
    (i) An article as defined in Sec. 372.3
    (ii) Foods, drugs, cosmetics, alcoholic beverages, tobacco, or 
tobacco products packaged for distribution to the general public.
    (iii) Any consumer product as the term is defined in the Consumer 
Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) packaged for distribution to 
the general public.
    (e) If the person considers the specific identity of a toxic 
chemical in a mixture or trade name product to be a trade secret under 
provisions of 29 CFR 1910.1200, the notice shall contain a generic 
chemical name that is descriptive of that toxic chemical.
    (f) If the person considers the specific percent by weight 
composition of a toxic chemical in the mixture or trade name product to 
be a trade secret under applicable State law or under the Restatement of 
Torts section 757, comment b, the notice must contain a statement that 
the chemical is present at a concentration that does not exceed a 
specified upper bound concentration value. For example, a mixture 
contains 12 percent of a toxic chemical. However, the supplier considers 
the specific concentration of the toxic chemical in the product to be a 
trade secret. The notice would indicate that the toxic chemical is 
present in the mixture in a concentration of no more than 15 percent by 
weight. The upper bound value chosen must be no larger than necessary to 
adequately protect the trade secret.
    (g) A person is not subject to the requirements of this section to 
the extent the person does not know that the facility or 
establishment(s) is selling or otherwise distributing a toxic chemical 
to another person in a mixture or trade name product. However, for 
purposes of this section, a person has such knowledge if the person 
receives a notice under this section from a supplier of a mixture or 
trade name product and the person in turn sells or otherwise distributes 
that mixture or trade name product to another person.
    (h) If two or more persons, who do not have any common corporate or 
business interest (including common ownership or control), as described 
in Sec. 372.38(f), operate separate establishments within a single 
facility, each such persons shall treat the establishment(s) it operates 
as a facility for purposes of this section. The determination under 
paragraph (a) of this section shall be made for those establishments.
