              the official codification of Federal regulations established 
              under the Federal Register Act. Under the provisions of 44 
              U.S.C. 1507, the contents of the CFR, a special edition of the 
              Federal Register, shall be judicially noticed. The CFR is 
              prima facie evidence of the original documents published in 
              the Federal Register (44 U.S.C. 1510).

          It is prohibited to use NARA's official seal and the stylized Code 
              of Federal Regulations logo on any republication of this 
              material without the express, written permission of the 
              Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee. 
              Any person using NARA's official seals and logos in a manner 
              inconsistent with the provisions of 36 CFR part 1200 is 
              subject to the penalties specified in 18 U.S.C. 506, 701, and

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2008), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

    Source: 68 FR 19090, Apr. 17, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

                        What This Subpart Covers


<R05>
Sec. 63.8980  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous 
air pollutants (NESHAP) and work practice standards for hazardous air 
pollutants (HAP) emitted from hydrochloric acid (HCl) production. This 
subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and 
continuous compliance with the emission limitations and work practice 
standards.


<R05>
Sec. 63.8985  Am I subject to this subpart?

    (a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate an HCl 
production facility that produces a liquid HCl product at a 
concentration of 30 weight percent or greater during its normal 
operations and is located at, or is part of, a major source of HAP. This 
does not include HCl production facilities that only produce 
occasionally liquid HCl product at a concentration of 30 weight percent 
or greater.
    (1) An HCl production facility is the collection of unit operations 
and equipment associated with the production of liquid HCl product. The 
HCl production facility begins at the point where a gaseous stream 
containing HCl enters the HCl production unit. The HCl production 
facility includes all HCl storage tanks that contain liquid HCl product 
that is produced in the HCl production unit, with the exceptions noted 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The HCl production facility also 
includes all HCl transfer operations that load HCl product produced in 
the HCl production unit into a tank truck, rail car, ship, or barge, 
along with the piping and other equipment in HCl service used to 
transfer liquid HCl product from the HCl production unit to the HCl 
storage tanks and/or HCl transfer operations. The HCl production 
facility ends at the point that the liquid HCl product produced in the 
HCl production unit is loaded into a tank truck, rail car, ship, or 
barge, at the point the HCl product enters another process on the plant 
site, or at the point the HCl product leaves the plant site via 
pipeline.
    (2) Storage tanks that are dedicated feedstock tanks for another 
process and storage tanks that store HCl dedicated for use in wastewater 
treatment are not considered part of an HCl production facility.
    (3) A major source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or 
group of stationary sources within a contiguous area under common 
control that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate 
of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP 
at a rate of 22.68 megagrams (25 tons) or more per year.
    (b) An HCl production facility is not subject to this subpart if it 
is also subject to NESHAP under one of the subparts listed in paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (5) of this section.
    (1) 40 CFR part 63, subpart S, National Emission Standards for 
Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Pulp and Paper Industry.

[[Page 16]]

    (2) 40 CFR part 63, subpart CCC, National Emission Standards for 
Hazardous Air Pollutants for Steel Pickling--HCl Process Facilities and 
Hydrochloric Acid Regeneration Plants.
    (3) 40 CFR part 63, subpart MMM, National Emission Standards for 
Hazardous Air Pollutants for Pesticide Active Ingredient Production.
    (4) 40 CFR part 63, section 63.994, subpart SS, National Emission 
Standards for Closed Vent Systems, Control Devices, Recovery Devices and 
Routing to a Fuel Gas System or a Process.
    (5) 40 CFR part 63, subpart GGG, National Emission Standards for 
Pharmaceuticals Production.
    (c) An HCl production facility is not subject to this subpart if it 
is located following the incineration of chlorinated waste gas streams, 
waste liquids, or solid wastes, and the emissions from the HCl 
production facility are subject to section 63.113(c), subpart G, 
National Emission Standards for Organic Hazardous Air Pollutants from 
the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry for Process Vents, 
Storage Vessels, Transfer Operations, and Wastewater.
    (d) An HCl production facility is not subject to this subpart if it 
produces HCl through the direct synthesis of hydrogen and chlorine and 
is part of a chlor-alkali facility.
    (e) An HCl production facility is not subject to this subpart if it 
is a research and development facility.
    (f) An HCl production facility is not subject to this subpart if all 
of the gaseous streams containing HCl and chlorine (Cl<INF>2</INF>) from 
HCl process vents, HCl storage tanks, and HCl transfer operations are 
recycled or routed to another process prior to being discharged to the 
atmosphere.

control devices are used, you must establish separate operating limits 
for each device.
    (3) If you do not conduct a performance test for a HCl storage tank 
or HCl transfer operation, you must use engineering assessments and/or 
manufacturer's recommendations to establish the operating limits 
specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (ii), or (e)(2), of this section.
    (4) As needed in applicability determinations, you must use ASTM 
E224 to determine the HCl concentration in liquid products.

    Source: 68 FR 28785, May 27, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

                        What This Subpart Covers


<R05>
Sec. 63.9280  What is the purpose of subpart PPPPP?

    This subpart PPPPP establishes national emission standards for 
hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for engine test cells/stands located 
at major sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emissions. This 
subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and 
continuous compliance with the emission limitations contained in this 
NESHAP.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9285  Am I subject to this subpart?

    You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate an engine test 
cell/stand that is located at a major source of HAP emissions.
    (a) An engine test cell/stand is any apparatus used for testing 
uninstalled stationary or uninstalled mobile (motive) engines.
    (b) An uninstalled engine is an engine that is not installed in, or 
an integrated part of, the final product.
    (c) A major source of HAP emissions is a plant site that emits or 
has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 10 tons (9.07 
megagrams) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 25 
tons (22.68 megagrams) or more per year.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9290  What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?

    This subpart applies to each new, reconstructed, or existing 
affected source.
    (a) Affected source. An affected source is the collection of all 
equipment and activities associated with engine test cells/stands used 
for testing uninstalled stationary or uninstalled mobile (motive) 
engines located at a major source of HAP emissions.
    (1) Existing affected source. An affected source is existing if you 
commenced construction or reconstruction of the affected source on or 
before May 14, 2002. A change in ownership of an existing affected 
source does not make that affected source a new or reconstructed 
affected source.
    (2) New affected source. An affected source is new if you commenced 
construction of the affected source after May 14, 2002.
    (3) Reconstructed affected source. An affected source is 
reconstructed if you meet the definition of reconstruction in Sec. 63.2 
of subpart A of this part and reconstruction is commenced after May 14, 
2002. Changes made to an existing affected source primarily for the 
purpose of complying with revisions to engine testing requirements under 
40 CFR parts 80, 86, 89, 90, 91, or 92 are not considered a modification 
or reconstruction. In addition, passive measurement and control 
instrumentation and electronics are not included as part of any affected 
source reconstruction evaluation.

[[Page 34]]

    (b) Existing affected sources do not have to meet the requirements 
of this subpart and of subpart A of this part.
    (c) Any portion of a new or reconstructed affected source located at 
a major source that is used exclusively for testing internal combustion 
engines with rated power of less than 25 horsepower (hp) (19 
kilowatts(kW)) does not have to meet the requirements of this subpart 
and of subpart A of this part except for the initial notification 
requirements of Sec. 63.9345(b).
    (d) Any portion of a new or reconstructed affected source located at 
a major source that meets any of the criteria specified in paragraphs 
(d)(1) through (4) of this section does not have to meet the 
requirements of this subpart and of subpart A of this part.
    (1) Any portion of the affected source used exclusively for testing 
combustion turbine engines.
    (2) Any portion of the affected source used exclusively for testing 
rocket engines.
    (3) Any portion of the affected source used in research and teaching 
activities at facilities that are not engaged in the development of 
engines or engine test services for commercial purposes.
    (4) Any portion of the affected source operated to test or evaluate 
fuels (such as knock engines), transmissions, or electronics.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9295  When do I have to comply with this subpart?

    (a) Affected sources. (1) If you start up your new or reconstructed 
affected source before May 27, 2003, you must comply with the emission 
limitations in this subpart no later than May 27, 2003.
    (2) If you start up your new or reconstructed affected source on or 
after May 27, 2003, you must comply with the emission limitations in 
this subpart upon startup.
    (b) Area sources that become major sources. If your new or 
reconstructed affected source is located at an area source that 
increases its emissions or its potential to emit such that it becomes a 
major source of HAP, your new or reconstructed affected source must be 
in compliance with this subpart when the area source becomes a major 
source.
    (c) You must meet the notification requirements in Sec. 63.9345 and 
in 40 CFR part 63, subpart A.

                          Emission Limitations


<R05>
Sec. 63.9300  What emission limitations must I meet?

    For each new or reconstructed affected source that is used in whole 
or in part for testing internal combustion engines with rated power of 
25 hp (19 kW) or more and that is located at a major source, you must 
comply with the emission limitations in Table 1 to this subpart. (Tables 
are found at the end of this subpart.)


<R05>
Sec. 63.9301  What are my options for meeting the emission limits?

    You may use either a continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) 
or a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) to demonstrate 
compliance with the emission limitations. Continuous monitoring systems 
must meet the requirements in Sec. 63.9306 (CPMS) and Sec. 63.9307 
(CEMS).


<R05>
Sec. 63.9302  What operating limits must I meet?

    (a) For any new or reconstructed affected source on which you use 
add-on controls, you must meet the operating limits specified in Table 2 
to this subpart. These operating limits must be established during the 
performance test according to the requirements in Sec. 63.9324. You 
must meet the operating limits at all times after you establish them.
    (b) If you use an add-on control device other than those listed in 
Table 2 to this subpart, or wish to monitor an alternative parameter and 
comply with a different operating limit, you must apply to the 
Administrator for approval of alternative monitoring under Sec. 
63.8(f).

                     General Compliane Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.9305  What are my general requirements for complying with this 

subpart?

    (a) You must be in compliance with the emission limitation that 
applies to you at all times, except during periods

of startup, shutdown, or malfunction (SSM) of your control device or 
associated monitoring equipment.
    (b) If you must comply with the emission limitation, you must 
operate and maintain your engine test cell/stand, air pollution control 
equipment, and monitoring equipment in a manner consistent with good air 
pollution control practices for minimizing emissions at all times.
    (c) You must develop a written SSM plan (SSMP) for emission control 
devices and associated monitoring equipment according to the provisions 
in Sec. 63.6(e)(3). The plan will apply only to emission control 
devices, and not to engine test cells/stands.

[68 FR 28785, May 27, 2003, as amended at 71 FR 20470, Apr. 20, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 63.9306  What are my continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) 

installation, operation, and maintenance requirements?

    (a) General. You must install, operate, and maintain each CPMS 
specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section according to 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section. You must install, 
operate, and maintain each CPMS specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section according to paragraphs (a)(3) through (5) of this section.
    (1) The CPMS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation for 
each successive 15-minute period. You must have a minimum of four 
equally spaced successive cycles of CPMS operation in 1 hour.
    (2) You must determine the average of all recorded readings for each 
successive 3-hour period of the emission capture system and add-on 
control device operation.
    (3) You must record the results of each inspection, calibration, and 
validation check of the CPMS.
    (4) You must maintain the CPMS at all times and have available 
necessary parts for routine repairs of the monitoring equipment.
    (5) You must operate the CPMS and collect emission capture system 
and add-on control device parameter data at all times that an engine 
test cell/stand is operating, except during monitoring malfunctions, 
associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities 
(including, if applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span 
adjustments).
    (6) You must not use emission capture system or add-on control 
device parameter data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, 
associated repairs, out-of-control periods, or required quality 
assurance or control activities when calculating data averages. You must 
use all the data collected during all other periods in calculating the 
data averages for determining compliance with the emission capture 
system and add-on control device operating limits.
    (7) A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not 
reasonably preventable failure of the CPMS to provide valid data. 
Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or 
careless operation are not malfunctions. Any period for which the 
monitoring system is out-of-control and data are not available for 
required calculations is a deviation from the monitoring requirements.
    (b) Capture system bypass line. You must meet the requirements of 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section for each emission capture 
system that contains bypass lines that could divert emissions away from 
the add-on control device to the atmosphere.
    (1) You must monitor or secure the valve or closure mechanism 
controlling the bypass line in a nondiverting position in such a way 
that the valve or closure mechanism cannot be opened without creating a 
record that the valve was opened. The method used to monitor or secure 
the valve or closure mechanism must meet one of the requirements 
specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.
    (i) Flow control position indicator. Install, calibrate, maintain, 
and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a flow 
control position indicator that takes a reading at least once every 15 
minutes and provides a record indicating whether the emissions are 
directed to the add-on control device or diverted from the add-on 
control device. The time of occurrence and flow control position must be 
recorded, as well as every time the flow direction is

[[Page 36]]

changed. The flow control position indicator must be installed at the 
entrance to any bypass line that could divert the emissions away from 
the add-on control device to the atmosphere.
    (ii) Car-seal or lock-and-key valve closures. Secure any bypass line 
valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type 
configuration. You must visually inspect the seal or closure mechanism 
at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the 
closed position, and the emissions are not diverted away from the add-on 
control device to the atmosphere.
    (iii) Valve closure monitoring. Ensure that any bypass line valve is 
in the closed (nondiverting) position through monitoring of valve 
position at least once every 15 minutes. You must inspect the monitoring 
system at least once every month to verify that the monitor will 
indicate valve position.
    (iv) Automatic shutdown system. Use an automatic shutdown system in 
which the engine testing operation is stopped when flow is diverted by 
the bypass line away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere 
when an engine test cell/stand is operating. You must inspect the 
automatic shutdown system at least once every month to verify that it 
will detect diversions of flow and shut down the engine test cell/stand 
in operation.
    (2) If any bypass line is opened, you must include a description of 
why the bypass line was opened and the length of time it remained open 
in the semiannual compliance reports required in Sec. 63.9350.
    (c) Thermal oxidizers and catalytic oxidizers. If you are using a 
thermal oxidizer or catalytic oxidizer as an add-on control device, you 
must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of 
this section.
    (1) For a thermal oxidizer, install a gas temperature monitor in the 
firebox of the thermal oxidizer or in the duct immediately downstream of 
the firebox before any substantial heat exchange occurs.
    (2) For a catalytic oxidizer, you must install a gas temperature 
monitor in the gas stream immediately before the catalyst bed, and if 
you established operating limits according to Sec. 63.9324(b)(1) and 
(2), also install a gas temperature monitor in the gas stream 
immediately after the catalyst bed.
    (i) If you establish operating limits according to Sec. 
63.9324(b)(1) and (2), then you must install the gas temperature 
monitors both upstream and downstream of the catalyst bed. The 
temperature monitors must be in the gas stream immediately before and 
after the catalyst bed to measure the temperature difference across the 
bed.
    (ii) If you establish operating limits according to Sec. 
63.9324(b)(3) and (4), then you must install a gas temperature monitor 
upstream of the catalyst bed. The temperature monitor must be in the gas 
stream immediately before the catalyst bed to measure the temperature.
    (3) For all thermal oxidizers and catalytic oxidizers, you must meet 
the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (c)(3)(i) through (vii) of this 
section for each gas temperature monitoring device.
    (i) Locate the temperature sensor in a position that provides a 
representative temperature.
    (ii) Use a temperature sensor with a measurement sensitivity of 4 
degrees Fahrenheit or 0.75 percent of the temperature value, whichever 
is larger.
    (iii) Shield the temperature sensor system from electromagnetic 
interference and chemical contaminants.
    (iv) If a gas temperature chart recorder is used, it must have a 
measurement sensitivity in the minor division of at least 20 degrees 
Fahrenheit.
    (v) Perform an electronic calibration at least semiannually 
according to the procedures in the manufacturer's owner's manual. 
Following the electronic calibration, you must conduct a temperature 
sensor validation check in which a second or redundant temperature 
sensor placed near the process temperature sensor must yield a reading 
within 30 degrees Fahrenheit of the process temperature sensor reading.
    (vi) Conduct calibration and validation checks anytime the sensor 
exceeds the manufacturer's specified maximum operating temperature range 
or install a new temperature sensor.
    (vii) At least monthly, inspect components for integrity and 
electrical

[[Page 37]]

connections for continuity, oxidation, and galvanic corrosion.
    (d) Emission capture systems. The capture system monitoring system 
must comply with the applicable requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) and 
(2) of this section.
    (1) For each flow measurement device, you must meet the requirements 
in paragraphs (a) and (d)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.
    (i) Locate a flow sensor in a position that provides a 
representative flow measurement in the duct from each capture device in 
the emission capture system to the add-on control device.
    (ii) Reduce swirling flow or abnormal velocity distributions due to 
upstream and downstream disturbances.
    (iii) Conduct a flow sensor calibration check at least semiannually.
    (iv) At least monthly, inspect components for integrity, electrical 
connections for continuity, and mechanical connections for leakage.
    (2) For each pressure drop measurement device, you must comply with 
the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (d)(2)(i) through (vi) of this 
section.
    (i) Locate the pressure sensor(s) in or as close to a position that 
provides a representative measurement of the pressure drop across each 
opening you are monitoring.
    (ii) Minimize or eliminate pulsating pressure, vibration, and 
internal and external corrosion.
    (iii) Check pressure tap pluggage daily.
    (iv) Using an inclined manometer with a measurement sensitivity of 
0.0002 inch water, check gauge calibration quarterly and transducer 
calibration monthly.
    (v) Conduct calibration checks any time the sensor exceeds the 
manufacturer's specified maximum operating pressure range or install a 
new pressure sensor.
    (vi) At least monthly, inspect components for integrity, electrical 
connections for continuity, and mechanical connections for leakage.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9307  What are my continuous emissions monitoring system installation, 

operation, and maintenance requirements?

    (a) You must install, operate, and maintain each CEMS to monitor 
carbon monoxide (CO) or total hydrocarbons (THC) and oxygen 
(O<INF>2</INF>) at the outlet of the exhaust system of the engine test 
cell/stand or at the outlet of the emission control device.
    (b) To comply with the CO or THC percent reduction emission 
limitation, you may install, operate, and maintain a CEMS to monitor CO 
or THC and O<INF>2</INF> at both the inlet and the outlet of the 
emission control device.
    (c) To comply with either emission limitations, the CEMS must be 
installed and operated according to the requirements described in 
paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.
    (1) You must install, operate, and maintain each CEMS according to 
the applicable Performance Specification (PS) of 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix B (PS-3 or PS-4A).
    (2) You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CEMS according 
to the requirements in 40 CFR 63.8 and according to PS-3 of 40 CFR part 
60, appendix B, using Reference Method 3A or 3B for the O<INF>2</INF> 
CEMS, and according to PS-4A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, using 
Reference Method 10 or 10B for the CO CEMS. If the fuel used in the 
engines being tested is natural gas, you may use ASTM D 6522-00, 
Standard Test Method for Determination of Nitrogen Oxides, Carbon 
Monoxide and Oxygen Concentrations in Emissions from Natural Gas Fired 
Reciprocating Engines, Combustion Turbines, Boilers, and Process Heaters 
Using Portable Analyzers (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14). 
As an alternative to Method 3B, you may use ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, 
``Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses [Part 10, Instruments and Apparatus],'' 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14).
    (3) As specified in Sec. 63.8(c)(4)(ii), each CEMS must complete a 
minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data 
recording) for each successive 15-minute period. You must have at least 
two data points, each representing a different 15-minute period within 
the same hour, to have a valid hour of data.
    (4) All CEMS data must be reduced as specified in Sec. 63.8(g)(2) 
and recorded as CO concentration in parts per million by volume, dry 
basis (ppmvd), corrected to 15 percent O<INF>2</INF> content.

[[Page 38]]

    (d) If you have CEMS that are subject to paragraph (a) or (b) of 
this section, you must properly maintain and operate the monitors 
continuously according to the requirements described in paragraphs 
(d)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (1) Proper Maintenance. You must maintain the monitoring equipment 
at all times that the engine test cell/stand is operating, including but 
not limited to, maintaining necessary parts for routine repairs of the 
monitoring equipment.
    (2) Continued Operation. You must operate your CEMS according to 
paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) You must conduct all monitoring in continuous operation at all 
times that the engine test cell/stand is operating, except for, as 
applicable, monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required 
quality assurance or control activities (including, as applicable, 
calibration drift checks and required zero and high-level adjustments). 
Quality assurance or control activities must be performed according to 
procedure 1 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix F.
    (ii) Data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated 
repairs, out-of-control periods, and required quality assurance or 
control activities must not be used for purposes of calculating data 
averages. You must use all of the data collected from all other periods 
in assessing compliance. A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, 
infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring 
equipment to provide valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in 
part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. Any 
period for which the monitoring system is out-of-control and data are 
not available for required calculations constitutes a deviation from the 
monitoring requirements.

               Testing and Initial Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.9310  By what date must I conduct the initial compliance 

demonstrations?

    You must conduct the initial compliance demonstrations that apply to 
you in Table 3 to this subpart within 180 calendar days after the 
compliance date that is specified for your new or reconstructed affected 
source in Sec. 63.9295 and according to the provisions in Sec. 
63.7(a)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 63.9320  What procedures must I use?

    (a) You must conduct each initial compliance demonstration that 
applies to you in Table 3 to this subpart.
    (b) You must conduct an initial performance evaluation of each 
capture and control system according to Sec. Sec. 63.9321, 63.9322, 
63.9323 and 63.9324, and each CEMS according to the requirements in 40 
CFR 63.8 and according to the applicable Performance Specification of 40 
CFR part 60, appendix B (PS-3 or PS-4A).
    (c) The initial demonstration of compliance with the carbon monoxide 
(CO) or total hydrocarbon (THC) concentration limitation consists of the 
first 4-hour rolling average CO or THC concentration recorded after 
completion of the CEMS performance evaluation. You must correct the CO 
or THC concentration at the outlet of the engine test cell/stand or the 
emission control device to a dry basis and to 15 percent O<INF>2</INF> 
content according to Equation 1 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MY03.002

Where:

C<INF>c</INF> = concentration of CO or THC, corrected to 15 percent 
oxygen, ppmvd
C<INF>unc</INF> = total uncorrected concentration of CO or THC, ppmvd
%O<INF>2d</INF> = concentration of oxygen measured in gas stream, dry 
basis, percent by volume.

    (d) The initial demonstration of compliance with the CO or THC 
percent reduction emission limitation consists of the first 4-hour 
rolling average percent reduction in CO or THC recorded after completion 
of the performance evaluation of the capture/control system and/or CEMS. 
You must complete the actions described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (2) 
of this section.
    (1) Correct the CO or THC concentrations at the inlet and outlet of 
the emission control device to a dry basis and to 15 percent 
O<INF>2</INF> content using Equation 1 of this section.
    (2) Calculate the percent reduction in CO or THC using Equation 2 of 
this section:

[[Page 39]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MY03.003

Where:

R = percent reduction in CO or THC
C<INF>i</INF> = corrected CO or THC concentration at inlet of the 
emission control device
C<INF>o</INF> = corrected CO or THC concentration at the outlet of the 
emission control device.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9321  What are the general requirements for performance tests?

    (a) You must conduct each performance test required by Sec. 63.9310 
according to the requirements in Sec. 63.7(e)(1) and under the 
conditions in this section unless you obtain a waiver of the performance 
test according to the provisions in Sec. 63.7(h).
    (1) Representative engine testing conditions. You must conduct the 
performance test under representative operating conditions for the test 
cell/stand. Operations during periods of SSM, and during periods of 
nonoperation do not constitute representative conditions. You must 
record the process information that is necessary to document operating 
conditions during the test and explain why the conditions represent 
normal operation.
    (2) Representative emission capture system and add-on control device 
operating conditions. You must conduct the performance test when the 
emission capture system and add-on control device are operating at a 
representative flow rate, and the add-on control device is operating at 
a representative inlet concentration. You must record information that 
is necessary to document emission capture system and add-on control 
device operating conditions during the test and explain why the 
conditions represent normal operation.
    (b) You must conduct each performance test of an emission capture 
system according to the requirements in Sec. 63.9322. You must conduct 
each performance test of an add-on control device according to the 
requirements in Sec. 63.9323.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9322  How do I determine the emission capture system efficiency?

    You must use the procedures and test methods in this section to 
determine capture efficiency as part of the performance test required by 
Sec. 63.9310.
    (a) Assuming 100 percent capture efficiency. You may assume the 
capture system efficiency is 100 percent if both conditions in 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section are met:
    (1) The capture system meets the criteria in Method 204 of appendix 
M to 40 CFR part 51 for a potential to emit (PTE) and directs all the 
exhaust gases from the enclosure to an add-on control device.
    (2) All engine test operations creating exhaust gases for which the 
test is applicable are conducted within the capture system.
    (b) Measuring capture efficiency. If the capture system does not 
meet the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, then you 
must use one of the two protocols described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of 
this section to measure capture efficiency. The capture efficiency 
measurements use total volatile hydrocarbon (TVH) capture efficiency as 
a surrogate for organic HAP capture efficiency. For the protocol in 
paragraph (c) of this section, the capture efficiency measurement must 
consist of three test runs. Each test run must be at least 3 hours in 
duration or the length of a production run, whichever is longer, up to 8 
hours. For the purposes of this test, a production run means the time 
required for a single engine test to go from the beginning to the end.
    (c) Gas-to-gas protocol using a temporary total enclosure or a 
building enclosure. The gas-to-gas protocol compares the mass of TVH 
emissions captured by the emission capture system to the mass of TVH 
emissions not captured. Use a temporary total enclosure or a building 
enclosure and the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this 
section to measure emission capture system efficiency using the gas-to-
gas protocol.
    (1) Either use a building enclosure or construct an enclosure around 
the engine test cell/stand and all areas where emissions from the engine 
testing subsequently occur. The enclosure must meet the applicable 
definition of a temporary total enclosure or building enclosure in 
Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51.
    (2) Use Method 204B or 204C of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to 
measure the

[[Page 40]]

total mass, kg, of TVH emissions captured by the emission capture system 
during each capture efficiency test run as measured at the inlet to the 
add-on control device. To make the measurement, substitute TVH for each 
occurrence of the term VOC in the methods.
    (i) The sampling points for the Method 204B or 204C of appendix M to 
40 CFR part 51 measurement must be upstream from the add-on control 
device and must represent total emissions routed from the capture system 
and entering the add-on control device.
    (ii) If multiple emission streams from the capture system enter the 
add-on control device without a single common duct, then the emissions 
entering the add-on control device must be simultaneously measured in 
each duct, and the total emissions entering the add-on control device 
must be determined.
    (3) Use Method 204D or 204E of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to 
measure the total mass, kg, of TVH emissions that are not captured by 
the emission capture system; they are measured as they exit the 
temporary total enclosure or building enclosure during each capture 
efficiency test run. To make the measurement, substitute TVH for each 
occurrence of the term VOC in the methods.
    (i) Use Method 204D of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 if the enclosure 
is a temporary total enclosure.
    (ii) Use Method 204E of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 if the 
enclosure is a building enclosure. During the capture efficiency 
measurement, all organic compound emitting operations inside the 
building enclosure, other than the engine test cell/stand operation for 
which capture efficiency is being determined, must be shut down, but all 
fans and blowers must be operating normally.
    (4) For each capture efficiency test run, determine the percent 
capture efficiency of the emission capture system using Equation 1 of 
this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MY03.004

Where:

CE = capture efficiency of the emission capture system vented to the 
add-on control device, percent
TVH<INF>captured</INF> = total mass of TVH captured by the emission 
capture system as measured at the inlet to the add-on control device 
during the emission capture efficiency test run, kg, determined 
according to paragraph (c)(2) of this section
TVH<INF>uncaptured</INF> = total mass of TVH that is not captured by the 
emission capture system and that exits from the temporary total 
enclosure or building enclosure during the capture efficiency test run, 
kg, determined according to paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

    (5) Determine the capture efficiency the emission capture system as 
the average of the capture efficiencies measured in the three test runs.
    (d) Alternative capture efficiency protocol. As an alternative to 
the procedure specified in paragraph (c) of this section, you may 
determine capture efficiency using any other capture efficiency protocol 
and test methods that satisfy the criteria of either the data quality 
objective or lower control limit approach as described in appendix A to

Sec. 63.9323  How do I determine the add-on control device emission 

destruction or removal efficiency?

    You must use the procedures and test methods in this section to 
determine the add-on control device emission destruction or removal 
efficiency as part of the performance test required by Sec. 63.9310. 
You must conduct three test runs as specified in Sec. 63.7(e)(3), and 
each test run must last at least 1 hour.
    (a) For all types of add-on control devices, use the test methods 
specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.
    (1) Use Method 1 or 1A of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as 
appropriate, to select sampling sites and velocity traverse points.

[[Page 41]]

    (2) Use Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G of appendix A to 40 CFR part 
60, as appropriate, to measure gas volumetric flow rate.
    (3) Use Method 3, 3A, or 3B of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as 
appropriate, for gas analysis to determine dry molecular weight. The 
ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 Part 10 is an acceptable alternative to Method 
3B (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14).
    (4) Use Method 4 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, to determine stack 
gas moisture.
    (5) Methods for determining gas volumetric flow rate, dry molecular 
weight, and stack gas moisture must be performed, as applicable, during 
each test run.
    (b) Measure total gaseous organic mass emissions as carbon at the 
inlet and outlet of the add-on control device simultaneously, using 
either Method 25 or 25A of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as specified in 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section. You must use the same 
method for both the inlet and outlet measurements.
    (1) Use Method 25 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 if the add-on 
control device is an oxidizer, and you expect the total gaseous organic 
concentration as carbon to be more than 50 parts per million at the 
control device outlet.
    (2) Use Method 25A of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 if the add-on 
control device is an oxidizer, and you expect the total gaseous organic 
concentration as carbon to be 50 ppm or less at the control device 
outlet.
    (c) For each test run, determine the total gaseous organic emissions 
mass flow rates for the inlet and the outlet of the add-on control 
device, using Equation 1 of this section. If there is more than one 
inlet or outlet to the add-on control device, you must calculate the 
total gaseous organic mass flow rate using Equation 1 of this section 
for each inlet and each outlet and then total all of the inlet emissions 
and total all of the outlet emissions.

M<INF>f</INF> = total gaseous organic emissions mass flow rate, kg/hour 
(kg/h)
C<INF>c</INF> = concentration of organic compounds as carbon in the vent 
gas, as determined by Method 25 or Method 25A, parts per million by 
volume (ppmv), dry basis
Q<INF>sd</INF> = volumetric flow rate of gases entering or exiting the 
add-on control device, as determined by Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G, 
dry standard cubic meters/hour (dscm/h)
0.0416 = conversion factor for molar volume, kg-moles per cubic meter 
(mol/m\3\) (@ 293 Kelvin [K] and 760 millimeters of mercury [mmHg]).

    (d) For each test run, determine the add-on control device organic 
emissions destruction or removal efficiency, using Equation 2 of this 
section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MY03.006

Where:

DRE = organic emissions destruction or removal efficiency of the add-on 
control device, percent
M<INF>fi</INF> = total gaseous organic emissions mass flow rate at the 
inlet(s) to the add-on control device, using Equation 1 of this section, 
kg/h
M<INF>fo</INF> = total gaseous organic emissions mass flow rate at the 
outlet(s) of the add-on control device, using Equation 1 of this 
section, kg/h.

    (e) Determine the emission destruction or removal efficiency of the 
add-on control device as the average of the efficiencies determined in 
the three test runs and calculated in Equation 2 of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9324  How do I establish the emission capture system and add-on 

control device operating limits during the performance test?

    During the performance test required by Sec. 63.9310, you must 
establish the operating limits required by Sec. 63.9302 according to 
this section, unless you have

[[Page 42]]

received approval for alternative monitoring and operating limits under 
Sec. 63.8(f) as specified in Sec. 63.9302.
    (a) Thermal oxidizers. If your add-on control device is a thermal 
oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (a)(1) 
and (2) of this section.
    (1) During the performance test, you must monitor and record the 
combustion temperature at least once every 15 minutes during each of the 
three test runs. You must monitor the temperature in the firebox of the 
thermal oxidizer or immediately downstream of the firebox before any 
substantial heat exchange occurs.
    (2) Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate 
and record the average combustion temperature maintained during the 
performance test. This average combustion temperature is the minimum 
operating limit for your thermal oxidizer.
    (b) Catalytic oxidizers. If your add-on control device is a 
catalytic oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to either 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) or paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section.
    (1) During the performance test, you must monitor and record the 
temperature just before the catalyst bed and the temperature difference 
across the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of 
the three test runs.
    (2) Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate 
and record the average temperature just before the catalyst bed and the 
average temperature difference across the catalyst bed maintained during 
the performance test. These are the minimum operating limits for your 
catalytic oxidizer.
    (3) As an alternative to monitoring the temperature difference 
across the catalyst bed, you may monitor the temperature at the inlet to 
the catalyst bed and implement a site-specific inspection and 
maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer as specified in paragraph 
(b)(4) of this section. During the performance test, you must monitor 
and record the temperature just before the catalyst bed at least once 
every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. Use the data 
collected during the performance test to calculate and record the 
average temperature just before the catalyst bed during the performance 
test. This is the minimum operating limit for your catalytic oxidizer.
    (4) You must develop and implement an inspection and maintenance 
plan for your catalytic oxidizer(s) for which you elect to monitor 
according to paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The plan must address, at 
a minimum, the elements specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (iii) 
of this section.
    (i) Annual sampling and analysis of the catalyst activity (i.e., 
conversion efficiency) following the manufacturer's or catalyst 
supplier's recommended procedures.
    (ii) Monthly inspection of the oxidizer system, including the burner 
assembly and fuel supply lines for problems and, as necessary, adjust 
the equipment to assure proper air-to-fuel mixtures.
    (iii) Annual internal and monthly external visual inspection of the 
catalyst bed to check for channeling, abrasion, and settling. If 
problems are found, you must take corrective action consistent with the 
manufacturer's recommendation and conduct a new performance test to 
determine destruction efficiency according to Sec. 63.9323.
    (c) Emission capture system. For each capture device that is not 
part of a PTE that meets the criteria of Sec. 63.9322(a), establish an 
operating limit for either the gas volumetric flow rate or duct static 
pressure, as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. The 
operating limit for a PTE is specified in Table 3 to this subpart.
    (1) During the capture efficiency determination required by Sec. 
63.9310, you must monitor and record either the gas volumetric flow rate 
or the duct static pressure for each separate capture device in your 
emission capture system at least once every 15 minutes during each of 
the three test runs at a point in the duct between the capture device 
and the add-on control device inlet.
    (2) Calculate and record the average gas volumetric flow rate or 
duct static pressure for the three test runs for each capture device. 
This average gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure is the 
minimum operating limit for that specific capture device.

this section. These instances are deviations from the emission 
limitation in this subpart and must be reported according to the 
requirements in Sec. 63.9350.
    (1) You must report each instance in which you did not meet the 
emission limitation that applies to you.
    (2) You must report each instance in which you did not meet the 
requirements in Table 7 to this subpart that apply to you.
    (c) Startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (1) Consistent with 
Sec. Sec. 63.6(e) and 63.7(e)(1), deviations that occur during a period 
of SSM of control devices and associated monitoring equipment are not 
violations if you demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that 
you were operating in accordance with Sec. 63.6(e)(1).
    (2) The Administrator will determine whether deviations that occur 
during a period of SSM of control devices and associated monitoring 
equipment are violations, according to the provisions in Sec. 63.6(e).

this subpart.
    Engine means any internal combustion engine, any combustion turbine 
engine, or any rocket engine.
    Engine Test Cell/Stand means any apparatus used for testing 
uninstalled stationary or uninstalled mobile (motive) engines.
    Hazardous Air Pollutant (HAP) means any air pollutant listed in or 
pursuant to section 112(b) of the CAA.
    Internal combustion engine means a device in which air enters a 
combustion chamber, is mixed with fuel, compressed in the chamber, and 
combusted. Fuel may enter the combustion chamber with the air or be 
injected into the combustion chamber. Expansion of the hot combustion 
gases in the chamber rotates a shaft, either through a reciprocating or 
rotary action. For purposes of this subpart, this definition does not 
include combustion turbine engines.
    Major source, as used in this subpart, shall have the same meaning 
as in Sec. 63.2.
    Malfunction means any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably 
preventable failure of air pollution control equipment, process 
equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner which 
causes, or has the potential to cause, the emission limitations in an 
applicable standard to be exceeded. Failures that are caused in part by 
poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.
    Rated power means the maximum power output of an engine in use.
    Potential to emit means the maximum capacity of a stationary source 
to emit a pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any 
physical or operational limitation on the capacity of the stationary 
source to emit a pollutant, including air pollution control equipment 
and restrictions on hours of

operation or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or 
processed, shall be treated as part of its design if the limitation or 
the effect it would have on emissions is federally enforceable.
    Responsible official means responsible official as defined by 40 CFR 
70.2.
    Rocket engine means a device consisting of a combustion chamber in 
which materials referred to as propellants, which provide both the fuel 
and the oxygen for combustion, are burned. Combustion gases escape 
through a nozzle, providing thrust.
    Uninstalled engine means an engine not installed in, or an 
integrated part of, the final product.

 Subpart QQQQQ_National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants 
             for Friction Materials Manufacturing Facilities

    Source: 67 FR 64506, Oct. 18, 2002, unless otherwise noted.

                        What This Subpart Covers


<R05>
Sec. 63.9480  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous 
air pollutants (NESHAP) for friction materials manufacturing facilities 
that use a solvent-based process. This subpart also establishes 
requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with all 
applicable emission limitations in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9485  Am I subject to this subpart?

    (a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a friction 
materials manufacturing facility (as defined in Sec. 63.9565) that is 
(or is part of) a major source of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) 
emissions on the first compliance date that applies to you, as specified 
in Sec. 63.9495. Your friction materials manufacturing facility is a 
major source of HAP if it emits or has the potential to emit any single 
HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year or any 
combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 megagrams (25 tons) or more per 
year.
    (b) The requirements in this subpart do not apply to research and 
development facilities, as defined in section 112(c)(7) of the Clean Air 
Act.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9490  What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?

    (a) This subpart applies to each new, reconstructed, or existing 
affected source at your friction materials manufacturing facility.
    (b) The affected source covered by this subpart is each new, 
reconstructed, or existing solvent mixer (as defined in Sec. 63.9565) 
at your friction materials manufacturing facility.
    (c) A solvent mixer at your friction materials manufacturing 
facility is new if you commence construction of the solvent mixer after 
October 18, 2002. An affected source is reconstructed if it meets the 
definition of ``reconstruction'' in Sec. 63.2, and reconstruction is 
commenced after October 18, 2002.
    (d) A solvent mixer at your friction materials manufacturing 
facility is existing if it is not new or reconstructed.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9495  When do I have to comply with this subpart?

    (a) If you have an existing solvent mixer, you must comply with each 
of the requirements for existing sources no later than October 18, 2005.
    (b) If you have a new or reconstructed solvent mixer and its initial 
startup date is after October 18, 2002, you must comply with the 
requirements for new and reconstructed sources upon initial startup.
    (c) If your friction materials manufacturing facility is an area 
source that increases its emissions or its potential to emit such that 
it becomes a (or part of a) major source of HAP emissions, then 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section apply.
    (1) For any portion of the area source that becomes a new or 
reconstructed affected source, you must comply with the requirements for 
new and reconstructed sources upon startup or no later than October 18, 
2002, whichever is later.
    (2) For any portion of the area source that becomes an existing 
affected source, you must comply with the requirements for existing 
sources no later than 1 year after the area source becomes a major 
source or no later than October 18, 2005, whichever is later.

[[Page 60]]

    (d) You must meet the notification and schedule requirements in 
Sec. 63.9535. Several of the notifications must be submitted before the 
compliance date for your affected source.

                          Emission Limitations


<R05>
Sec. 63.9500  What emission limitations must I meet?

    (a) For each new, reconstructed, or existing large solvent mixer at 
your friction materials manufacturing facility, you must limit HAP 
solvent emissions to the atmosphere to no more than 30 percent of that 
which would otherwise be emitted in the absence of solvent recovery and/
or solvent substitution, based on a 7-day block average.
    (b) For each new, reconstructed, or existing small solvent mixer at 
your friction materials manufacturing facility, you must limit HAP 
solvent emissions to the atmosphere to no more than 15 percent of that 
which would otherwise be emitted in the absence of solvent recovery and/
or solvent substitution, based on a 7-day block average.

                     General Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.9505  What are my general requirements for complying with this

              Initial Compliance Demonstration Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.9510  By what date must I conduct my initial compliance demonstration?

    (a) If you use a solvent recovery system and/or solvent 
substitution, you must conduct your initial compliance demonstration 
within 7 calendar days after the compliance date that is specified for 
your source in Sec. 63.9495.
    (b) If you use a control technique other than a solvent recovery 
system and/or solvent substitution, you must comply with the provisions 
in Sec. 63.9570.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9515  How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission 

limitation that applies to me?

    (a) You have demonstrated initial compliance for each new, 
reconstructed, or existing large solvent mixer subject to the emission 
limitation in Sec. 63.9500(a) if the HAP solvent discharged to the 
atmosphere during the first 7 days after the compliance date, determined 
according to the provisions in Sec. 63.9520, does not exceed a 7-day 
block average of 30 percent of that which would otherwise be emitted in 
the absence of solvent recovery and/or solvent substitution.
    (b) You have demonstrated initial compliance for each new, 
reconstructed, or existing small solvent mixer subject to the emission 
limitation in Sec. 63.9500(b) if the HAP solvent discharged to the 
atmosphere during the first 7 days after the compliance date, determined 
according to the provisions in Sec. 63.9520, does not exceed a 7-day

percent of HAP solvent discharged to the atmosphere for each mix batch 
according to Equation 1 of this section as follows:

(Eq. 1)
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18OC02.002

Where:

P<INF>b</INF> = Percent of HAP solvent discharged to the atmosphere for 
each mix batch, percent;
S<INF>rec</INF> = Weight of HAP solvent recovered for each mix batch, 
lb;
S<INF>mix</INF> = Weight of HAP solvent loaded into the solvent mixer 
for each mix batch, lb.

    (6) If you use solvent substitution for a mix batch, you must record 
the use of a non-HAP material as a substitute for a HAP solvent for that 
mix batch and assign a value of 0 percent to the percent of HAP solvent 
discharged to the atmosphere for that mix batch (Pb).
    (7) Determine the 7-day block average percent of HAP solvent 
discharged to the atmosphere according to Equation 2 of this section as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18OC02.003

Where:

%P<INF>7</INF> = 7-day block average percent of HAP solvent discharged 
to the atmosphere, percent;
i = mix batch;
n = number of mix batches in 7-day block average.

    (8) Have valid data for at least 90 percent of the mix batches over 
the 7-day averaging period.
    (b) If you use a control technique other than a solvent recovery 
system and/or solvent substitution, you may apply to EPA for approval to 
use an alternative method of demonstrating compliance with the emission 
limitations for solvent mixers in Sec. 63.9500(a) and (b), as provided 
in Sec. 63.9570.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9525  What are the installation, operation, and maintenance 

requirements for my weight measurement device?

solvent loaded into the solvent mixer and the weight of HAP solvent 
recovered for each mix batch.
    (b) For each weight measurement device required by this section, you 
must develop and submit for approval a site-specific monitoring plan 
that addresses the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this 
section:
    (1) Procedures for installing the weight measurement device;
    (2) The minimum accuracy of the weight measurement device in pounds 
and as a percent of the average weight of solvent to be loaded into the 
solvent mixer;
    (3) Site-specific procedures for how the measurements will be made;
    (4) How the measurement data will be recorded, reduced, and stored;
    (5) Procedures and acceptance criteria for calibration of the weight 
measurement device; and
    (6) How the measurement device will be maintained, including a 
routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list.

<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.05 kilograms (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.1 pounds) 
or <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent of the average weight of solvent to 
be loaded into the solvent mixer, whichever is greater.
    (2) An initial multi-point calibration of the weight measurement 
device must be made using 5 points spanning the expected range of weight 
measurements before the weight measurement device can be used. The 
manufacturer's calibration results can be used to meet this requirement.
    (3) Once per day, an accuracy audit must be made using a single 
Class F calibration weight that corresponds to 20 to 80 percent of the 
average weight of solvent to be loaded into the solvent

[[Page 62]]

mixer. If the weight measurement device cannot reproduce the value of 
the calibration weight within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.05 kilograms (0.1 
pounds) or <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent of the average weight of 
solvent to be loaded into the solvent mixer, whichever is greater, the 
scale must be recalibrated before being used again. The recalibration 
must be performed with at least five Class F calibration weights 
spanning the expected range of weight measurements.
    (d) You must operate and maintain the weight measurement device 
according to the site-specific monitoring plan.

affected source is operating and record all information needed to 
document conformance with these requirements.
    (2) For new, reconstructed, or existing large solvent mixers, 
maintain the 7-day block average percent of HAP solvent discharged to 
the atmosphere at or below 30 percent of that which would otherwise be 
emitted in the absence of solvent recovery and/or solvent substitution.
    (3) For new, reconstructed, or existing small solvent mixers, 
maintain the 7-day block average percent of HAP solvent discharged to 
the atmosphere at or below 15 percent of that which would otherwise be 
emitted in the absence of solvent recovery and/or solvent substitution.
    (b) If you use a control technique other than a solvent recovery 
system and/or solvent substitution, you must demonstrate continuous 
compliance with the emission limitations for solvent mixers in Sec. 
63.9500(a) and (b) according to the provisions in Sec. 63.9570.
    (c) You must report each instance in which you did not meet the 
emission limitations for solvent mixers in Sec. 63.9500(a) and (b).

    (e) You must meet the notification and schedule requirements in 
Sec. 63.9640. Several of these notifications must be submitted before 
the compliance date for your affected source.

            Emission Limitations and Work Practice Standards


<R05>
Sec. 63.9590  What emission limitations must I meet?

    (a) You must meet each emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart 
that applies to you.
    (b) You must meet each operating limit for control devices in 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section that applies to you.
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, for each 
wet scrubber applied to meet any particulate matter emission limit in 
Table 1 to this subpart, you must maintain the daily average pressure 
drop and daily average scrubber water flow rate at or above the minimum 
levels established during the initial performance test.
    (2) For each dynamic wet scrubber applied to meet any particulate 
matter emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart, you must maintain the 
daily average scrubber water flow rate and either the daily average fan 
amperage (a surrogate for fan speed as revolutions per minute) or the 
daily average pressure drop at or above the minimum levels established 
during the initial performance test.
    (3) For each dry electrostatic precipitator applied to meet any 
particulate matter emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart, you must 
meet the operating limits in paragraph (b)(3)(i) or (ii) of this 
section.
    (i) Maintain the 6-minute average opacity of emissions exiting the 
control device stack at or below the level established during the 
initial performance test.
    (ii) Maintain the daily average secondary voltage and daily average 
secondary current for each field at or above the minimum levels 
established during the initial performance test.
    (4) For each wet electrostatic precipitator applied to meet any 
particulate matter emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart, you must 
meet the operating limits in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (iii) of this 
section.
    (i) Maintain the daily average secondary voltage for each field at 
or above the minimum levels established during the initial performance 
test.

[[Page 69]]

    (ii) Maintain the daily average stack outlet temperature at or below 
the maximum levels established during the initial performance test.
    (iii) Maintain the daily average water flow rate at or above the 
minimum levels established during the initial performance test.
    (5) If you use any air pollution control device other than a 
baghouse, wet scrubber, dynamic scrubber, dry electrostatic 
precipitator, or wet electrostatic precipitator, you must submit a site-
specific monitoring plan in accordance with Sec. 63.9631(f).

of air pollution control device (e.g., wet scrubbers, dynamic wet 
scrubbers, rotoclones, multiclones, wet and dry electrostatic 
precipitators, and baghouses). You cannot group emission units with 
different air pollution control device types together for the purposes 
of this section.
    (3) The site-specific operating limits established for the emission 
unit selected as representative of a group of similar emission units 
will be used as the operating limit for each emission unit within the 
group. The operating limit established for the representative unit must 
be met by each emission unit within the group.

representative emission units within an ore crushing and handling 
affected source or a finished pellet handling affected source, you must 
submit a testing plan for initial performance tests. This testing plan 
must be submitted to the Administrator or delegated authority no later 
than 90 days prior to the first scheduled initial performance test. The 
testing plan must contain the information specified in paragraphs (g)(1) 
through (3) of this section.

demonstrate initial compliance with either the proposed emission limit 
or the promulgated emission limit no later than 180 calendar days after 
October 30, 2003 or no later than 180 calendar days after startup of the 
source, whichever is later, according to Sec. 63.7(a)(2)(ix).
    (j) If you commenced construction or reconstruction of an affected 
source between December 18, 2002 and October 30, 2003, and you chose to 
comply with

[[Page 73]]

the proposed emission limit when demonstrating initial compliance, you 
must conduct a second performance test to demonstrate compliance with 
the promulgated emission limit by 3 years and 180 calendar days after

the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) Using the CPMS required in Sec. 63.9631(b), measure and record 
the pressure drop and scrubber water flow rate every 15 minutes during 
each run of the particulate matter performance test.

historical average pressure drop data are used to establish an operating 
limit (i.e., using data from a certified performance test conducted 
prior to the promulgation date of the final rule), then the average 
particulate matter concentration corresponding to the historical 
performance test must be at or below the applicable indurating furnace 
emission limit, as listed in Table 1 to this subpart.

field corresponding to any of the three test runs.
    (d) For a wet electrostatic precipitator subject to performance 
testing in Sec. 63.9620 and operating limit in Sec. 63.9590(b)(4), you 
must establish a site-specific operating limit according to the

you must again measure and record the daily average operating parameter 
value for the emission unit or group of similar emission units. If the 
daily average operating parameter value for the emission unit or group 
of similar emission units meets the operating limit established for the 
corresponding unit or group, then the corrective action was successful 
and the emission unit or group of similar emission units is in 
compliance with the established operating limits.
    (3) If the second attempt at corrective action required in paragraph 
(j)(2) of this section was not successful, then you must repeat the 
procedures of paragraph (j)(2) of this section until the corrective 
action is successful. If the third attempt at corrective action is 
unsuccessful, you must conduct another performance test in accordance 
with the procedures in Sec. 63.9622(f) and report to the Administrator 
as a deviation the third unsuccessful attempt at corrective action.
    (4) After the third unsuccessful attempt at corrective action, you 
must submit to the Administrator the written report required in 
paragraph (j)(3) of this section within 5 calendar days after the third 
unsuccessful attempt at corrective action. This report must notify the 
Administrator that a deviation has occurred and document the types of 
corrective measures taken to address the problem that resulted in the 
deviation of established operating parameters and the resulting 
operating limits.

or loading.
    Straight grate indurating furnace means a furnace system that 
consists of a traveling grate that carries the taconite pellets through 
different furnace temperature zones. In the straight grate indurating 
furnace a layer of fired pellets, called the hearth layer, is placed on 
the traveling grate prior to the addition of unfired pellets. The 
straight grate indurating furnace begins at the point where the grate 
feed conveyor discharges the green balls onto the furnace traveling 
grate and ends where the hardened pellets drop off of the traveling 
grate.
    Taconite iron ore processing means the separation and concentration 
of iron ore from taconite, a low-grade iron ore, to produce taconite

 Subpart SSSSS_National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants 
                  for Refractory Products Manufacturing

    Source: 68 FR 18747, Apr. 16, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

                        What This Subpart Covers


<R05>
Sec. 63.9780  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous 
air pollutants (NESHAP) for refractory products manufacturing 
facilities. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate 
initial and continuous compliance with the emission limitations.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9782  Am I subject to this subpart?

    You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a refractory 
products manufacturing facility that is, is located at, or is part of, a 
major source of hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions according to the 
criteria in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (a) A refractory products manufacturing facility is a plant site 
that manufactures refractory products (refractory bricks, refractory 
shapes, monolithics, kiln furniture, crucibles, and other materials used 
for lining furnaces and other high temperature process units), as 
defined in Sec. 63.9824. Refractory products manufacturing facilities 
typically process raw material by crushing, grinding, and screening; 
mixing the processed raw materials with binders and other additives; 
forming the refractory mix into shapes; and drying and firing the 
shapes.
    (b) A major source of HAP is a plant site that emits or has the 
potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) 
or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 megagrams 
(25 tons) or more per year.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9784  What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?

    (a) This subpart applies to each new, reconstructed, or existing 
affected source at a refractory products manufacturing facility.
    (b) The existing affected sources are shape dryers, curing ovens, 
and kilns that are used to manufacture refractory products that use 
organic HAP; shape preheaters, pitch working tanks, defumers, and coking 
ovens that are used to produce pitch-impregnated refractory products; 
kilns that are used to manufacture chromium refractory products; and 
kilns that are used to manufacture clay refractory products.
    (c) The new or reconstructed affected sources are shape dryers, 
curing ovens, and kilns that are used to manufacture refractory products 
that use organic HAP; shape preheaters, pitch working tanks, defumers, 
and coking ovens used to produce pitch-impregnated refractory products; 
kilns that are used to manufacture chromium refractory products; and 
kilns that are used to manufacture clay refractory products.
    (d) Shape dryers, curing ovens, kilns, coking ovens, defumers, shape 
preheaters, and pitch working tanks that are research and development 
(R&D) process units are not subject to the requirements of this subpart. 
(See definition of research and development process unit in Sec. 
63.9824).
    (e) A source is a new affected source if you began construction of 
the affected source after June 20, 2002, and you met the applicability 
criteria at the time you began construction.

[[Page 93]]

    (f) An affected source is reconstructed if you meet the criteria as 
defined in Sec. 63.2.
    (g) An affected source is existing if it is not new or 
reconstructed.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9786  When do I have to comply with this subpart?

    (a) If you have a new or reconstructed affected source, you must 
comply with this subpart according to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this 
section.
    (1) If the initial startup of your affected source is before April 
16, 2003, then you must comply with the emission limitations for new and 
reconstructed sources in this subpart no later than April 16, 2003.
    (2) If the initial startup of your affected source is after April 
16, 2003, then you must comply with the emission limitations for new and 
reconstructed sources in this subpart upon initial startup of your 
affected source.
    (b) If you have an existing affected source, you must comply with 
the emission limitations for existing sources no later than April 17, 
2006.
    (c) You must be in compliance with this subpart when you conduct a 
performance test on an affected source.
    (d) If you have an existing area source that increases its emissions 
or its potential to emit such that it becomes a major source of HAP, you 
must be in compliance with this subpart according to paragraphs (d)(1) 
and (2) of this section.
    (1) Any portion of the existing facility that is a new affected 
source or a new reconstructed source must be in compliance with this 
subpart upon startup.
    (2) All other parts of the existing facility must be in compliance 
with this subpart by 3 years after the date the area source becomes a 
major source.
    (e) If you have a new area source (i.e., an area source for which 
construction or reconstruction was commenced after June 20, 2002) that 
increases its emissions or its potential to emit such that it becomes a 
major source of HAP, you must be in compliance with this subpart upon 
initial startup of your affected source as a major source.
    (f) You must meet the notification requirements in Sec. 63.9812 
according to the schedule in Sec. 63.9812 and in 40 CFR part 63, 
subpart A. Some of the notifications must be submitted before you are 
required to comply with the emission limitations in this subpart.

            Emission Limitations and Work Practice Standards


<R05>
Sec. 63.9788  What emission limits, operating limits, and work practice 

standards must I meet?

    (a) You must meet each emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart 
that applies to you.
    (b) You must meet each operating limit in Table 2 to this subpart 
that applies to you.
    (c) You must meet each work practice standard in Table 3 to this 
subpart that applies to you.


<R05>
Sec. 63.9790  What are my options for meeting the emission limits?

    To meet the emission limits in Table 1 to this subpart, you must use 
one or both of the options listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section.
    (a) Emissions control system. Use an emissions capture and 
collection system and an add-on air pollution control device (APCD) and

or (iii) of this section.
    (i) If your flow rate CPMS includes a redundant sensor, record three 
pairs of concurrent flow rate measurements within a 24-hour period. Each 
pair of concurrent measurements must consist of a flow rate measurement 
by each of the two flow rate sensors. The minimum time interval between 
any two such pairs of consecutive flow rate measurements is 1 hour. The 
measurements must be taken during periods when the process and control 
device that is monitored by your flow rate CPMS are operating normally. 
Calculate the mean of the three flow rate measurement values for each 
flow rate sensor. The mean values must agree within the required overall 
accuracy of the CPMS, as specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (ii) If your flow rate CPMS does not include a redundant flow rate

document is available from the U.S. EPA; Office of Air Quality Planning 
and Standards; Emissions, Monitoring and Analysis Division; Emission 
Measurement Center (D205-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. It is 
also available on the Technology Transfer Network (TTN) at the following 
address: http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc/cem.html. Other types of bag leak 
detection systems must be installed, operated, calibrated, and 
maintained in a manner consistent with the manufacturer's written 
specifications and recommendations.
    (2) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the 
manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter (PM) 
emissions at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter 
(0.0044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.
    (3) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide an output of 
relative PM loadings.
    (4) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with a device to 
continuously record the output signal from the sensor.

must be installed in each baghouse compartment or cell.
    (7) For negative pressure or induced air fabric filters, the bag 
leak detector must be installed downstream of the fabric filter.
    (8) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's 
instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
    (9) The baseline output must be established by adjusting the range 
and the averaging period of the device and establishing the alarm set 
points and the alarm delay time according to section 5.0 of the ``Fabric 
Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance.''
    (10) Following initial adjustment of the system, the owner or 
operator must not adjust the sensitivity or range, averaging period, 
alarm set points, or alarm delay time except as detailed in the OM&M 
plan. In no case may the sensitivity be increased by more than 100 
percent or decreased by more than 50 percent over a 365-day period 
unless such adjustment follows a complete fabric filter inspection that 
demonstrates that the fabric filter is in good operating condition. You 
must record each adjustment of your bag leak detection system.
    (11) Record the results of each inspection, calibration, and 
validation check.
    (g) For each lime feed rate measurement device that is used to 
monitor the lime feed rate of a dry injection fabric filter (DIFF) or 
dry lime scrubber/fabric filter (DLS/FF), or the chemical feed rate of a

<R05>
Sec. 63.9806  How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission 

limits, operating limits, and work practice standards?

    (a) You must demonstrate initial compliance with each emission limit 
that applies to you according to the requirements specified in Table 5 
to this subpart.
    (b) You must establish each site-specific operating limit in Table 2 
to this subpart that applies to you according to the requirements 
specified in Sec. 63.9800 and Table 4 to this subpart.
    (c) You must demonstrate initial compliance with each work practice 
standard that applies to you according to the requirements specified in 
Table 6 to this subpart.
    (d) You must submit the Notification of Compliance Status containing

                   Continuous Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.9808  How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate continuous 

compliance?

    (a) You must monitor and collect data according to this section.
    (b) At all times, you must maintain your monitoring systems 
including, but not limited to, maintaining necessary parts for routine 
repairs of the monitoring equipment.
    (c) Except for, as applicable, monitoring system malfunctions, 
associated repairs, and required quality assurance or quality control 
activities, you must monitor continuously whenever your affected process 
unit is operating. For purposes of calculating data averages, you must 
not use data recorded during monitoring system malfunctions, associated 
repairs, and required quality assurance or quality control activities. 
You must use all the data collected

[[Page 104]]

during all other periods in assessing compliance. A monitoring system 
malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable 
failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring 
system malfunctions include out of control continuous monitoring systems 
(CMS), such as a CPMS. Any averaging period for which you do not have 
valid monitoring data as a result of a monitoring system malfunction and 
for which such data are required constitutes a deviation, and you must 
notify the Administrator in accordance with Sec. 63.9814(e). Monitoring 
system failures are different from monitoring system malfunctions in 
that they are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation. 
Any period for which there is a monitoring system failure and data are 
not available for required calculations constitutes a deviation and you 
must notify the Administrator in accordance with Sec. 63.9814(e).


<R05>
Sec. 63.9810  How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission 

limits, operating limits, and work practice standards?

    (a) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each emission 
limit specified in Table 1 to this subpart that applies to you according 
to the requirements specified in Table 7 to this subpart.
    (b) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each operating 
limit specified in Table 2 to this subpart that applies to you according 
to the requirements specified in Table 8 to this subpart.
    (c) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each work 
practice standard specified in Table 3 to this subpart that applies to 
you according to the requirements specified in Table 9 to this subpart.
    (d) For each affected source that is equipped with an add-on APCD 
that is not addressed in Table 2 to this subpart or that is using 
process changes as a means of meeting the emission limits in Table 1 to 
this subpart, you must demonstrate continuous compliance with each 
emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart and each operating limit 
established as required in Sec. 63.9800(i)(3) according to the methods 
specified in your approved alternative monitoring methods request as 
described in Sec. 63.9800(i)(2).
    (e) You must report each instance in which you did not meet each 
emission limit and each operating limit in this subpart that applies to 
you. This includes periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction. These 
instances are deviations from the emission limitations in this subpart. 
These deviations must be reported according to the requirements in Sec. 
63.9814.
    (1) [Reserved]
    (2) Consistent with Sec. Sec. 63.6(e) and 63.7(e)(1), deviations 
that occur during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction are not 
violations if you demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that 
you were operating in accordance with Sec. 63.6(e)(1) and your OM&M 
plan. The Administrator will determine whether deviations that occur 
during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction are violations, 
according to the provisions in Sec. 63.6(e).

pitch impregnation during the shape

[[Page 109]]

preheating, impregnation, defuming, and, if applicable, coking 
processes.
    Batch process means a process in which a set of refractory shapes is

workability and green or dry strength.
    Catalytic oxidizer means an add-on air pollution control device that 
is designed specifically to destroy organic compounds in a process 
exhaust gas stream by catalytic incineration. A catalytic oxidizer 
includes a bed of catalyst media through which the process exhaust 
stream passes to promote combustion and incineration at a lower 
temperature than would be possible without the catalyst.

support, or position ceramic or refractory products in a kiln during the 
firing process.
    Maximum organic HAP processing rate means the combination of process 
and refractory product formulation that has the greatest potential to 
emit organic HAP. The maximum organic HAP processing rate is a function 
of the organic HAP processing rate, process operating temperature, and 
other process operating parameters that affect emissions of organic HAP. 
(See also the definition of organic HAP processing rate.)
    Organic HAP processing rate means the rate at which the mass of 
organic HAP materials contained in refractory shapes are processed in an

function of the amount of organic HAP contained in the resins, binders, 
and additives used in a refractory mix; the amounts of those resins, 
binders, and additives in the refractory mix; and the rate at which the 
refractory shapes formed from the refractory mix are processed in an 
affected thermal process unit. For continuous process units, the organic 
HAP processing rate is expressed in units of mass of organic HAP per 
unit of time (e.g., pounds per hour). For batch process units, the 
organic HAP processing rate is expressed in units of mass of organic HAP 
per unit mass of refractory shapes processed during the batch process 
cycle (e.g., pounds per ton).

emissions of the applicable pollutant that is greater than any other 
period of consecutive hourly mass emissions for the same pollutant over 
the course of a specified batch process cycle, as defined in paragraphs 
(1) and (2) of this definition. The peak emissions period is a function 
of the rate at which the temperature of the refractory shapes is 
increased, the mass and loading configuration of the shapes in the 
process unit, the constituents of the refractory mix, and the type of 
pollutants emitted.
    (1) The 3-hour peak THC emissions period is the period of 3 
consecutive hours over which the sum of the hourly THC mass emissions 
rates is greater than the sum of the hourly THC mass emissions rates for 
any other period of 3 consecutive hours during the same batch process 
cycle.
    (2) The 3-hour peak HF emissions period is the period of 3 
consecutive hours over which the sum of the hourly HF mass emissions 
rates is greater than the sum of the hourly HF mass emissions rates for 
any other period of 3 consecutive hours during the same batch process 
cycle.
    Period of natural gas curtailment or supply interruption means a 
period of

[[Page 111]]

time during which the supply of natural gas to an affected facility is 
halted for reasons beyond the control of the facility. An increase in 
the cost or unit price of natural gas does not constitute a period of 
natural gas curtailment or supply interruption.
    Pitch means the residue from the distillation of petroleum or coal 
tar.
    Pitch-bonded refractory product means a formed refractory product 
that is manufactured using pitch as a bonding agent. Pitch-bonded 
refractory products are manufactured by mixing pitch with magnesium

than 50 percent.
    Pitch working tank means a tank that is used for heating pitch to 
the impregnation temperature, typically between 150[deg] and 260 [deg]C 
(300[deg] and 500 [deg]F); temporarily storing heated pitch between 
impregnation cycles; and transferring pitch to and from the autoclave 
during the impregnation step in manufacturing pitch-impregnated 
refractory products.
    Plant site means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under 
common control, including properties that are separated only by a road 
or other public right-of-way. Common control includes properties that 
are owned, leased, or operated by the same entity, parent entity, 
subsidiary, or any combination thereof.
    Redundant sensor means a second sensor or a back-up sensor that is 
integrated into a CPMS and is used to check the parameter value (e.g., 
temperature, pressure) measured by the primary sensor of the CPMS.
    Refractory product means nonmetallic materials containing less than 
50 percent carbon by weight and having those chemical and physical 
properties that make them applicable for structures, or as components of 
systems, that are exposed to environments above 538 [deg]C (1000 
[deg]F). This definition includes, but is not limited to: refractory 
bricks, kiln furniture, crucibles, refractory ceramic fiber, and other 
materials used as linings for boilers, kilns, and other processing units 
and equipment where extremes of temperature, corrosion, and abrasion 
would destroy other materials.

with specific dimensions.
    Research and development process unit means any process unit whose 
purpose is to conduct research and development for new processes and 
products and is not engaged in the manufacture of products for 
commercial sale, except in a de minimis manner.
    Resin-bonded refractory product means a formed refractory product 
that is manufactured using a phenolic resin or other type of 
thermosetting resin as a bonding agent. Resin-bonded refractory products 
are manufactured by mixing resin with alumina, magnesium oxide, 
graphite, silica, zirconia, or other refractory raw materials, and 
forming the mix into shapes. After forming, resin-bonded refractory 
products are cured in a curing oven and may be subsequently fired in a 
kiln.

scrubber, or any other air pollution control equipment that reduces the 
quantity of ethylene oxide in the effluent gas stream from sterilization 
and aeration processes.
    Combination sterilization unit means any enclosed vessel in which 
both the sterilization process and the aeration

[[Page 155]]

process occur within the same vessel, i.e., the vessel is filled with 
ethylene oxide gas or an ethylene oxide/inert gas mixture for the 
purpose of sterilizing and is followed by off-gassing of ethylene oxide.
    Common aeration time means that items require the same length of 
time to off-gas ethylene oxide.
    Full load means the maximum number of items that does not impede 
proper air removal, humidification of the load, or sterilant penetration 
and evacuation in the sterilization unit.
    Hospital means a facility that provides medical care and treatment 
for patients who are acutely ill or chronically ill on an inpatient 
basis under supervision of licensed physicians and under nursing care

based on generally accepted medical practices, necessitate sterilizing 
without a full load in order to protect human health.
    State or local regulation means a regulation at the State or local 
level that requires a hospital to reduce the quantity of ethylene oxide 
emissions from ethylene oxide sterilization units.
    Sterilization facility means the group of ethylene oxide 
sterilization units at a hospital using ethylene oxide gas or an 
ethylene oxide/inert gas mixture for the purpose of sterilizing.
    Sterilization process means any time when ethylene oxide is removed 
from the sterilization unit or combination sterilization unit through

                  Standards and Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.10685  What are the requirements for the control of contaminants from 

scrap?

    (a) Chlorinated plastics, lead, and free organic liquids. For 
metallic scrap utilized in the EAF at your facility, you must comply 
with the requirements in either paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section. 
You may have certain scrap at your facility subject to paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section and other scrap subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section provided the scrap remains segregated until charge make-up.
    (1) Pollution prevention plan. For the production of steel other 
than leaded steel, you must prepare and implement a pollution prevention 
plan for metallic scrap selection and inspection to minimize the amount 
of chlorinated plastics, lead, and free organic liquids that is charged 
to the furnace. For the production of leaded steel, you must prepare and 
implement a pollution prevention plan for scrap selection and inspection 
to minimize the amount of chlorinated plastics and free organic liquids 
in the scrap that is charged to the furnace. You must submit the scrap 
pollution prevention plan to the permitting authority for approval. You 
must operate according to the plan as submitted during the review and 
approval process, operate according to the approved plan at all times 
after approval, and address any deficiency identified by the permitting 
authority within 60 days following disapproval of a plan. You may 
request approval to revise the plan and may operate according to the 
revised plan unless and until the revision is disapproved by the 
permitting authority. You must keep a copy of the plan onsite, and you 
must provide training on the plan's requirements to all plant personnel 
with materials acquisition or inspection duties. Each plan must include 
the information in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section:
    (i) Specifications that scrap materials must be depleted (to the 
extent practicable) of undrained used oil filters, chlorinated plastics, 
and free organic liquids at the time of charging to the furnace.
    (ii) A requirement in your scrap specifications for removal (to the 
extent practicable) of lead-containing components (such as batteries, 
battery cables, and wheel weights) from the scrap, except for scrap used 
to produce leaded steel.
    (iii) Procedures for determining if the requirements and 
specifications in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are met (such as 
visual inspection or periodic audits of scrap providers) and procedures 
for taking corrective actions with vendors whose shipments are not 
within specifications.
    (iv) The requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section do not 
apply to the routine recycling of baghouse bags or other internal 
process or maintenance materials in the furnace. These exempted 
materials must be identified in the pollution prevention plan.
    (2) Restricted metallic scrap. For the production of steel other 
than leaded steel, you must not charge to a furnace metallic scrap that 
contains scrap from motor vehicle bodies, engine blocks, oil filters, 
oily turnings, machine shop borings, transformers or capacitors 
containing polychlorinated biphenyls, lead-containing components, 
chlorinated plastics, or free organic liquids. For the production of 
leaded steel, you must not charge to the furnace metallic scrap that 
contains scrap from motor vehicle bodies, engine blocks, oil filters, 
oily turnings, machine shop borings, transformers or capacitors 
containing polychlorinated biphenyls, chlorinated plastics, or free 
organic liquids. This restriction does not apply to any post-consumer 
engine blocks, post-consumer oil filters, or oily turnings that are 
processed or cleaned to the extent practicable such that the materials 
do not include lead components, chlorinated plastics, or free organic 
liquids. This restriction does not apply to motor vehicle scrap that is 
charged to recover the chromium or nickel content if you meet the

[[Page 158]]

requirements in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (b) Mercury requirements. For scrap containing motor vehicle scrap, 
you must procure the scrap pursuant to one of the compliance options in 
paragraphs (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section for each scrap provider, 
contract, or shipment. For scrap that does not contain motor vehicle 
scrap, you must procure the scrap pursuant to the requirements in 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section for each scrap provider, contract, or 
shipment. You may have one scrap provider, contract, or shipment subject 
to one compliance provision and others subject to another compliance 
provision.
    (1) Site-specific plan for mercury switches. You must comply with 
the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (v) of this section.
    (i) You must include a requirement in your scrap specifications for 
removal of mercury switches from vehicle bodies used to make the scrap.
    (ii) You must prepare and operate according to a plan demonstrating 
how your facility will implement the scrap specification in paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section for removal of mercury switches. You must 
submit the plan to the permitting authority for approval. You must 
operate according to this plan as submitted during the review and 
approval process, operate according to the approved plan at all times 
after approval, and address any deficiency identified by the permitting 
authority within 60 days following disapproval of a plan. You may 
request approval to revise the plan and may operate according to the 
revised plan unless and until the revision is disapproved by the 
permitting authority. The permitting authority may change the approval 
status of the plan upon 90-days written notice based upon the semiannual 
compliance report or other information. The plan must include:
    (A) A means of communicating to scrap purchasers and scrap providers 
the need to obtain or provide motor vehicle scrap from which mercury 
switches have been removed and the need to ensure the proper management 
of the mercury switches removed from that scrap as required under the 
rules implementing subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery 
Act (RCRA) (40 CFR parts 261 through 265 and 268). The plan must include 
documentation of direction to appropriate staff to communicate to 
suppliers throughout the scrap supply chain the need to promote the 
removal of mercury switches from end-of-life vehicles. Upon the request 
of the permitting authority, you must provide examples of materials that 
are used for outreach to suppliers, such as letters, contract language, 
policies for purchasing agents, and scrap inspection protocols;
    (B) Provisions for obtaining assurance from scrap providers that 
motor vehicle scrap provided to the facility meet the scrap 
specification;
    (C) Provisions for periodic inspections or other means of 
corroboration to ensure that scrap providers and dismantlers are 
implementing appropriate steps to minimize the presence of mercury 
switches in motor vehicle scrap and that the mercury switches removed 
are being properly managed, including the minimum frequency such means 
of corroboration will be implemented; and
    (D) Provisions for taking corrective actions (i.e., actions 
resulting in scrap providers removing a higher percentage of mercury 
switches or other mercury-containing components) if needed, based on the 
results of procedures implemented in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) of this 
section).
    (iii) You must require each motor vehicle scrap provider to provide 
an estimate of the number of mercury switches removed from motor vehicle 
scrap sent to your facility during the previous year and the basis for 
the estimate. The permitting authority may request documentation or 
additional information at any time.
    (iv) You must establish a goal for each scrap provider to remove at 
least 80 percent of the mercury switches. Although a site-specific plan 
approved under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may require only the 
removal of convenience light switch mechanisms, the permitting authority 
will credit all documented and verifiable mercury-containing components 
removed from motor vehicle scrap (such as sensors in anti-locking brake 
systems, security systems, active ride control, and other

[[Page 159]]

applications) when evaluating progress towards the 80 percent goal.
    (v) For each scrap provider, you must submit semiannual progress 
reports to the permitting authority that provide the number of mercury 
switches removed or the weight of mercury recovered from the switches, 
the estimated number of vehicles processed, an estimate of the percent 
of mercury switches removed, and certification that the removed mercury 
switches were recycled at RCRA-permitted facilities or otherwise 
properly managed pursuant to RCRA subtitle C regulations referenced in 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. This information can be 
submitted in aggregated form and does not have to be submitted for each 
scrap provider, contract, or shipment. The permitting authority may 
change the approval status of a site-specific plan following 90-days 
notice based on the progress reports or other information.
    (2) Option for approved mercury programs. You must certify in your 
notification of compliance status that you participate in and purchase 
motor vehicle scrap only from scrap providers who participate in a 
program for removal of mercury switches that has been approved by the 
Administrator based on the criteria in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through 
(iii) of this section. If you purchase motor vehicle scrap from a 
broker, you must certify that all scrap received from that broker was 
obtained from other scrap providers who participate in a program for the 
removal of mercury switches that has been approved by the Administrator 
based on the criteria in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this 
section. The National Vehicle Mercury Switch Recovery Program and the 
Vehicle Switch Recovery Program mandated by Maine State law are EPA-
approved programs under paragraph (b)(2) of this section unless and 
until the Administrator disapproves the program (in part or in whole) 
under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (i) The program includes outreach that informs the dismantlers of 
the need for removal of mercury switches and provides training and 
guidance for removing mercury switches;
    (ii) The program has a goal to remove at least 80 percent of mercury 
switches from the motor vehicle scrap the scrap provider processes. 
Although a program approved under paragraph (b)(2) of this section may 
require only the removal of convenience light switch mechanisms, the 
Administrator will credit all documented and verifiable mercury-
containing components removed from motor vehicle scrap (such as sensors 
in anti-locking brake systems, security systems, active ride control, 
and other applications) when evaluating progress towards the 80 percent 
goal; and
    (iii) The program sponsor agrees to submit progress reports to the 
Administrator no less frequently than once every year that provide the 
number of mercury switches removed or the weight of mercury recovered 
from the switches, the estimated number of vehicles processed, an 
estimate of the percent of mercury switches recovered, and certification 
that the recovered mercury switches were recycled at facilities with 
permits as required under the rules implementing subtitle C of RCRA (40 
CFR parts 261 through 265 and 268). The progress reports must be based 
on a database that includes data for each program participant; however, 
data may be aggregated at the State level for progress reports that will 
be publicly available. The Administrator may change the approval status 
of a program or portion of a program (e.g., at the State level) 
following 90-days notice based on the progress reports or on other 
information.
    (iv) You must develop and maintain onsite a plan demonstrating the 
manner through which your facility is participating in the EPA-approved 
program.
    (A) The plan must include facility-specific implementation elements, 
corporate-wide policies, and/or efforts coordinated by a trade 
association as appropriate for each facility.
    (B) You must provide in the plan documentation of direction to 
appropriate staff to communicate to suppliers throughout the scrap 
supply chain the need to promote the removal of mercury switches from 
end-of-life vehicles. Upon the request of the permitting authority, you 
must provide examples of materials that are used for outreach to

[[Page 160]]

suppliers, such as letters, contract language, policies for purchasing 
agents, and scrap inspection protocols.
    (C) You must conduct periodic inspections or provide other means of 
corroboration to ensure that scrap providers are aware of the need for 
and are implementing appropriate steps to minimize the presence of 
mercury in scrap from end-of-life vehicles.
    (3) Option for specialty metal scrap. You must certify in your 
notification of compliance status that the only materials from motor 
vehicles in the scrap are materials recovered for their specialty alloy 
(including, but not limited to, chromium, nickel, molybdenum, or other 
alloys) content (such as certain exhaust systems) and, based on the 
nature of the scrap and purchase specifications, that the type of scrap 
is not reasonably expected to contain mercury switches.
    (4) Scrap that does not contain motor vehicle scrap. For scrap not 
subject to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this 
section, you must certify in your notification of compliance status and 
maintain records of documentation that this scrap does not contain motor 
vehicle scrap.
    (c) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements. In addition to the 
records required by Sec. 63.10, you must keep records to demonstrate 
compliance with the requirements for your pollution prevention plan in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section and/or for the use of only restricted 
scrap in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and for mercury in paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (3) of this section as applicable. You must keep records 
documenting compliance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section for scrap 
that does not contain motor vehicle scrap.
    (1) If you are subject to the requirements for a site-specific plan 
for mercury under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, you must:
    (i) Maintain records of the number of mercury switches removed or 
the weight of mercury recovered from the switches and properly managed, 
the estimated number of vehicles processed, and an estimate of the 
percent of mercury switches recovered; and
    (ii) Submit semiannual reports of the number of mercury switches 
removed or the weight of mercury recovered from the switches and 
properly managed, the estimated number of vehicles processed, an 
estimate of the percent of mercury switches recovered, and a 
certification that the recovered mercury switches were recycled at RCRA-
permitted facilities. The semiannual reports must include a 
certification that you have conducted inspections or taken other means 
of corroboration as required under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) of this 
section. You may include this information in the semiannual compliance 
reports required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (2) If you are subject to the option for approved mercury programs 
under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, you must maintain records 
identifying each scrap provider and documenting the scrap provider's 
participation in an approved mercury switch removal program. If you 
purchase motor vehicle scrap from a broker, you must maintain records 
identifying each broker and documentation that all scrap provided by the 
broker was obtained from other scrap providers who participate in an 
approved mercury switch removal program.
    (3) You must submit semiannual compliance reports to the 
Administrator for the control of contaminants from scrap according to 
the requirements in Sec. 63.10(e). The report must clearly identify any 
deviation from the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section and the corrective action taken. You must identify which 
compliance option in paragraph (b) of this section applies to each scrap 
provider, contract, or shipment.


<R05>
Sec. 63.10686  What are the requirements for electric arc furnaces and argon-

oxygen decarburization vessels?

    (a) You must install, operate, and maintain a capture system that 
collects the emissions from each EAF (including charging, melting, and 
tapping operations) and argon-oxygen decarburization (AOD) vessel and 
conveys the collected emissions to a control device for the removal of 
particulate matter (PM).
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, you must 
not discharge or cause the discharge into the

[[Page 161]]

atmosphere from an EAF or AOD vessel any gases which:
    (1) Exit from a control device and contain in excess of 0.0052 
grains of PM per dry standard cubic foot (gr/dscf); and
    (2) Exit from a melt shop and, due solely to the operations of any 
affected EAF(s) or AOD vessel(s), exhibit 6 percent opacity or greater.
    (c) If you own or operate a new or existing affected source that has 
a production capacity of less than 150,000 tons per year (tpy) of 
stainless or specialty steel (as determined by the maximum production if 
specified in the source's operating permit or EAF capacity and maximum 
number of operating hours per year), you must not discharge or cause the 
discharge into the atmosphere from an EAF or AOD vessel any gases which:
    (1) Exit from a control device and contain particulate matter (PM) 
in excess of 0.8 pounds per ton (lb/ton) of steel. Alternatively, the 
owner or operator may elect to comply with a PM limit of 0.0052 grains 
per dry standard cubic foot (gr/dscf); and
    (2) Exit from a melt shop and, due solely to the operations of any 
affected EAF(s) or AOD vessel(s), exhibit 6 percent opacity or greater.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, you must 
conduct performance tests to demonstrate initial compliance with the 
applicable emissions limit for each emissions source subject to an 
emissions limit in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
    (1) You must conduct each PM performance test for an EAF or AOD 
vessel according to the procedures in Sec. 63.7 and 40 CFR 60.275a 
using the following test methods in 40 CFR part 60, appendices A-1, A-2, 
A-3, and A-4:
    (i) Method 1 or 1A of appendix A-1 of 40 CFR part 60 to select 
sampling port locations and the number of traverse points in each stack 
or duct. Sampling sites must be located at the outlet of the control 
device (or at the outlet of the emissions source if no control device is 
present) prior to any releases to the atmosphere.
    (ii) Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G of appendix A-1 of 40 CFR part 
60 to determine the volumetric flow rate of the stack gas.
    (iii) Method 3, 3A, or 3B of appendix A-3 of 40 CFR part 60 to 
determine the dry molecular weight of the stack gas. You may use ANSI/
ASME PTC 19.10-1981, ``Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses'' (incorporated by 
reference--see Sec. 63.14) as an alternative to EPA Method 3B.
    (iv) Method 4 of appendix A-3 of 40 CFR part 60 to determine the 
moisture content of the stack gas.
    (v) Method 5 or 5D of appendix A-3 of 40 CFR part 60 to determine 
the PM concentration. Three valid test runs are needed to comprise a PM 
performance test. For EAF, sample only when metal is being melted and 
refined. For AOD vessels, sample only when the operation(s) are being 
conducted.
    (2) You must conduct each opacity test for a melt shop according to 
the procedures in Sec. 63.6(h) and Method 9 of appendix A-4 of 40 CFR 
part 60. When emissions from any EAF or AOD vessel are combined with 
emissions from emission sources not subject to this subpart, you must 
demonstrate compliance with the melt shop opacity limit based on 
emissions from only the emission sources subject to this subpart.
    (3) During any performance test, you must monitor and record the 
information specified in 40 CFR 60.274a(h) for all heats covered by the 
test.
    (4) You must notify and receive approval from the Administrator for 
procedures that will be used to determine compliance for an EAF or AOD 
vessel when emissions are combined with those from facilities not 
subject to this subpart.
    (5) To determine compliance with the PM emissions limit in paragraph 
(c) of this section for an EAF or AOD vessel in a lb/ton of steel 
format, compute the process-weighted mass emissions (E<INF>p</INF>) for 
each test run using Equation 1 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28DE07.004

Where:

E<INF>p</INF> = Process-weighted mass emissions of PM, lb/ton;
C = Concentration of PM or total metal HAP, gr/dscf;
Q = Volumetric flow rate of stack gas, dscf/hr;

[[Page 162]]

T = Total time during a test run that a sample is withdrawn from the 
stack during steel production cycle, hr;
P = Total amount of metal produced during the test run, tons; and
K = Conversion factor, 7,000 grains per pound.

    (6) If you own or operate an existing affected source that is 
subject to the emissions limits in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, 
you may certify initial compliance with the applicable emission limit 
for one or more emissions sources based on the results of a previous 
performance test for that emissions source in lieu of the requirement 
for an initial performance test provided that the test(s) were conducted 
within 5 years of the compliance date using the methods and procedures 
specified in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section; the test(s) were 
for the affected facility; and the test(s) were representative of 
current or anticipated operating processes and conditions. Should the 
permitting authority deem the prior test data unacceptable to 
demonstrate compliance with an applicable emissions limit, the owner or 
operator must conduct an initial performance test within 180 days of the 
compliance date or within 90 days of receipt of the notification of 
disapproval of the prior test, whichever is later.
    (e) You must monitor the capture system and PM control device 
required by this subpart, maintain records, and submit reports according 
to the compliance assurance monitoring requirements in 40 CFR part 64. 
The exemption in 40 CFR 64.2(b)(1)(i) for emissions limitations or 
standards proposed after November 15, 1990 under section 111 or 112 of 
the CAA does not apply. In lieu of the deadlines for submittal in 40 CFR 
64.5, you must submit the monitoring information required by 40 CFR 64.4 
to the applicable permitting authority for approval by no later than the 
compliance date for your affected source for this subpart and operate 
according to the approved plan by no later than 180 days after the date 
of approval by the permitting authority.

 Subpart ZZZZZ_National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants 
                for Iron and Steel Foundries Area Sources

    Source: 73 FR 252, Jan. 2, 2008, unless otherwise noted.

                   Applicability and Compliance Dates


<R05>
Sec. 63.10880  Am I subject to this subpart?

    (a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate an iron 
and steel foundry that is an area source of hazardous air pollutant 
(HAP) emissions.
    (b) This subpart applies to each new or existing affected source. 
The affected source is each iron and steel foundry.
    (1) An affected source is existing if you commenced construction or 
reconstruction of the affected source before September 17, 2007.
    (2) An affected source is new if you commenced construction or 
reconstruction of the affected source on or after September 17, 2007. If 
an affected source is not new pursuant to the preceding sentence, it is 
not new as a result of a change in its compliance obligations pursuant 
to Sec. 63.10881(d).
    (c) On and after January 2, 2008, if your iron and steel foundry 
becomes a major source as defined in Sec. 63.2, you must meet the 
requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart EEEEE.
    (d) This subpart does not apply to research and development 
facilities, as defined in section 112(c)(7) of the Clean Air Act.
    (e) You are exempt from the obligation to obtain a permit under 40 
CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71, provided you are not otherwise required 
by law to obtain a permit under 40 CFR 70.3(a) or 40 CFR 71.3(a). 
Notwithstanding the previous sentence, you must continue to comply with 
the provisions of this subpart.
    (f) If you own or operate an existing affected source, you must 
determine the initial applicability of the requirements of this subpart 
to a small foundry or a large foundry based on your facility's metal 
melt production for calendar year 2008. If the metal melt production for 
calendar year 2008 is 20,000 tons or less, your area source is a small 
foundry. If your metal melt production for calendar year 2008 is greater 
than 20,000 tons, your area source is a large foundry. You must submit a 
written notification to the Administrator that identifies your area 
source as a small

[[Page 166]]

foundry or a large foundry no later than January 2, 2009.
    (g) If you own or operate a new affected source, you must determine 
the initial applicability of the requirements of this subpart to a small 
foundry or a large foundry based on your facility's annual metal melting 
capacity at startup. If the annual metal melting capacity is 10,000 tons 
or less, your area source is a small foundry. If the annual metal 
melting capacity is greater than 10,000 tons, your area source is a 
large foundry. You must submit a written notification to the 
Administrator that identifies your area source as a small foundry or a 
large foundry no later than 120 days after startup.


<R05>
Sec. 63.10881  What are my compliance dates?

    (a) If you own or operate an existing affected source, you must 
achieve compliance with the applicable provisions of this subpart by the 
dates in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) Not later than January 2, 2009 for the pollution prevention 
management practices for metallic scrap in Sec. 63.10885(a) and binder 
formulations in Sec. 63.10886.

initial determination required in Sec. 63.10880(f) for the standards 
and management practices in Sec. 63.10895.
    (b) If you have a new affected source for which the initial startup 
date is on or before January 2, 2008, you must achieve compliance with 
the provisions of this subpart not later than January 2, 2008.
    (c) If you own or operate a new affected source for which the 
initial startup date is after January 2, 2008, you must achieve 
compliance with the provisions of this subpart upon startup of your 
affected source.
    (d) Following the initial determination for an existing affected 
source required in Sec. 63.10880(f),
    (1) Beginning January 1, 2010, if the annual metal melt production 
of your small foundry exceeds 20,000 tons during the preceding calendar 
year, you must submit a notification of foundry reclassification to the 
Administrator within 30 days and comply with the requirements in 
paragraphs (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.
    (i) If your small foundry has never been classified as a large

later than the date of your foundry's most recent notification that the 
annual metal melt production exceeded 20,000 tons.
    (2) If your facility is initially classified as a large foundry (or 
your small foundry subsequently becomes a large foundry), you must 
comply with the requirements for a large foundry for at least 3 years 
before reclassifying your facility as a small foundry, even if your 
annual metal melt production falls below 20,000 tons. After 3 years, you 
may reclassify your facility as a small foundry provided your annual 
metal melt production for the preceding calendar year was 20,000 tons or 
less. If you reclassify your large foundry as a small foundry, you must 
submit a notification of reclassification to the Administrator within 30 
days and comply with the requirements for a small foundry no later than 
the date you notify the Administrator of the reclassification. If the 
annual metal melt production exceeds 20,000 tons during a subsequent

<R05>
Sec. 63.10885  What are my management practices for metallic scrap and mercury 

switches?

    (a) Metallic scrap management program. For each segregated metallic 
scrap storage area, bin or pile, you must comply with the materials 
acquisition requirements in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section. You 
must keep a copy of the material specifications onsite and readily 
available to all personnel with material acquisition duties, and provide 
a copy to each of your scrap providers. You may have certain scrap 
subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section and other scrap subject to 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section at your facility provided the metallic 
scrap remains segregated until charge make-up.
    (1) Restricted metallic scrap. You must prepare and operate at all 
times according to written material specifications for the purchase and 
use of only metal ingots, pig iron, slitter, or other materials that do 
not include post-consumer automotive body scrap, post-consumer engine 
blocks, post-consumer oil filters, oily turnings, lead components, 
chlorinated plastics, or free liquids. For the purpose of this subpart, 
``free liquids'' is defined as material that fails the paint filter test 
by EPA Method 9095B, ``Paint Filter Liquids Test'' (revision 2), 
November 2004 (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 63.14). The 
requirements for no free liquids do not apply if the owner or operator 
can demonstrate that the free liquid is water that resulted from scrap 
exposure to rain.
    (2) General iron and steel scrap. You must prepare and operate at 
all times according to written material specifications for the purchase 
and use of only iron and steel scrap that has been depleted (to the 
extent practicable) of organics and HAP metals in the charge materials 
used by the iron and steel foundry. The materials specifications must 
include at minimum the information specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) or 
(ii) of this section.
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, 
specifications for metallic scrap materials charged to a scrap preheater 
or metal melting furnace to be depleted (to the extent practicable) of 
the presence of used oil filters, chlorinated plastic parts, accessible 
lead-containing components (such as batteries and wheel weights), and a 
program to ensure the scrap materials are drained of free liquids.
    (ii) For scrap charged to a cupola metal melting furnace that is 
equipped with an afterburner, specifications for metallic scrap 
materials to be depleted (to the extent practicable) of the presence of 
chlorinated plastics, accessible lead-containing components (such as 
batteries and wheel weights), and a program to ensure the scrap 
materials are drained of free liquids.
    (b) Mercury requirements. For scrap containing motor vehicle scrap, 
you must procure the scrap pursuant to one of the compliance options in 
paragraphs (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section for each scrap provider, 
contract, or shipment. For scrap that does not contain motor vehicle 
scrap, you must procure the scrap pursuant to the requirements in 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section for each scrap provider, contract, or 
shipment. You may have one scrap provider, contract, or shipment subject 
to one compliance provision and others subject to another compliance 
provision.

[[Page 168]]

    (1) Site-specific plan for mercury switches. You must comply with 
the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (v) of this section.
    (i) You must include a requirement in your scrap specifications for 
removal of mercury switches from vehicle bodies used to make the scrap.
    (ii) You must prepare and operate according to a plan demonstrating 
how your facility will implement the scrap specification in paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section for removal of mercury switches. You must 
submit the plan to the Administrator for approval. You must operate 
according to the plan as submitted during the review and approval 
process, operate according to the approved plan at all times after 
approval, and address any deficiency identified by the Administrator or 
delegated authority within 60 days following disapproval of a plan. You 
may request approval to revise the plan and may operate according to the 
revised plan unless and until the revision is disapproved by the 
Administrator or delegated authority. The Administrator or delegated 
authority may change the approval status of the plan upon 90-days 
written notice based upon the semiannual report or other information. 
The plan must include:
    (A) A means of communicating to scrap purchasers and scrap providers 
the need to obtain or provide motor vehicle scrap from which mercury 
switches have been removed and the need to ensure the proper management 
of the mercury switches removed from the scrap as required under the 
rules implementing subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery 
Act (RCRA) (40 CFR parts 261 through 265 and 268). The plan must include 
documentation of direction to appropriate staff to communicate to 
suppliers throughout the scrap supply chain the need to promote the 
removal of mercury switches from end-of-life vehicles. Upon the request 
of the Administrator or delegated authority, you must provide examples 
of materials that are used for outreach to suppliers, such as letters, 
contract language, policies for purchasing agents, and scrap inspection 
protocols;
    (B) Provisions for obtaining assurance from scrap providers motor 
vehicle scrap provided to the facility meet the scrap specification;
    (C) Provisions for periodic inspections or other means of 
corroboration to ensure that scrap providers and dismantlers are 
implementing appropriate steps to minimize the presence of mercury 
switches in motor vehicle scrap and that the mercury switches removed 
are being properly managed, including the minimum frequency such means 
of corroboration will be implemented; and
    (D) Provisions for taking corrective actions (i.e., actions 
resulting in scrap providers removing a higher percentage of mercury 
switches or other mercury-containing components) if needed, based on the 
results of procedures implemented in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) of this 
section).
    (iii) You must require each motor vehicle scrap provider to provide 
an estimate of the number of mercury switches removed from motor vehicle 
scrap sent to the facility during the previous year and the basis for 
the estimate. The Administrator may request documentation or additional 
information at any time.
    (iv) You must establish a goal for each scrap supplier to remove at 
least 80 percent of the mercury switches. Although a site-specific plan 
approved under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may require only the 
removal of convenience light switch mechanisms, the Administrator will 
credit all documented and verifiable mercury-containing components 
removed from motor vehicle scrap (such as sensors in anti-locking brake 
systems, security systems, active ride control, and other applications) 
when evaluating progress towards the 80 percent goal.
    (v) For each scrap provider, you must submit semiannual progress 
reports to the Administrator that provide the number of mercury switches 
removed or the weight of mercury recovered from the switches, the 
estimated number of vehicles processed, an estimate of the percent of 
mercury switches removed, and certification that the removed mercury 
switches were recycled at RCRA-permitted facilities or otherwise 
properly managed pursuant to RCRA subtitle C regulations referenced

[[Page 169]]

in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. This information can be 
submitted in aggregate form and does not have to be submitted for each 
shipment. The Administrator may change the approval status of a site-
specific plan following 90-days notice based on the progress reports or 
other information.
    (2) Option for approved mercury programs. You must certify in your 
notification of compliance status that you participate in and purchase 
motor vehicle scrap only from scrap providers who participate in a 
program for removal of mercury switches that has been approved by the 
Administrator based on the criteria in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through 
(iii) of this section. If you purchase motor vehicle scrap from a 
broker, you must certify that all scrap received from that broker was 
obtained from other scrap providers who participate in a program for the 
removal of mercury switches that has been approved by the Administrator 
based on the criteria in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this 
section. The National Mercury Switch Recovery Program and the State of 
Maine Mercury Switch Removal Program are EPA-approved programs under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section unless and until the Administrator 
disapproves the program (in part or in whole) under paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (i) The program includes outreach that informs the dismantlers of 
the need for removal of mercury switches and provides training and 
guidance for removing mercury switches;
    (ii) The program has a goal to remove at least 80 percent of mercury 
switches from motor vehicle scrap the scrap provider processes. Although 
a program approved under paragraph (b)(2) of this section may require 
only the removal of convenience light switch mechanisms, the 
Administrator will credit all documented and verifiable mercury-
containing components removed from motor vehicle scrap (such as sensors 
in anti-locking brake systems, security systems, active ride control, 
and other applications) when evaluating progress towards the 80 percent 
goal; and
    (iii) The program sponsor agrees to submit progress reports to the 
Administrator no less frequently than once every year that provide the 
number of mercury switches removed or the weight of mercury recovered 
from the switches, the estimated number of vehicles processed, an 
estimate of the percent of mercury switches recovered, and certification 
that the recovered mercury switches were recycled at facilities with 
permits as required under the rules implementing subtitle C of RCRA (40 
CFR parts 261 through 265 and 268). The progress reports must be based 
on a database that includes data for each program participant; however, 
data may be aggregated at the State level for progress reports that will 
be publicly available. The Administrator may change the approval status 
of a program or portion of a program (e.g., at the State level) 
following 90-days notice based on the progress reports or on other 
information.
    (iv) You must develop and maintain onsite a plan demonstrating the 
manner through which your facility is participating in the EPA-approved 
program.
    (A) The plan must include facility-specific implementation elements, 
corporate-wide policies, and/or efforts coordinated by a trade 
association as appropriate for each facility.
    (B) You must provide in the plan documentation of direction to 
appropriate staff to communicate to suppliers throughout the scrap 
supply chain the need to promote the removal or mercury switches from 
end-of-life vehicles. Upon the request of the Administrator or delegated 
authority, you must provide examples of materials that are used for 
outreach to suppliers, such as letters, contract language, policies for 
purchasing agents, and scrap inspection protocols.
    (C) You must conduct periodic inspections or other means of 
corroboration to ensure that scrap providers are aware of the need for 
and are implementing appropriate steps to minimize the presence of 
mercury in scrap from end-of-life vehicles.
    (3) Option for specialty metal scrap. You must certify in your 
notification of compliance status and maintain records of documentation 
that the only materials from motor vehicles in the scrap are materials 
recovered for their

[[Page 170]]

specialty alloy (including, but not limited to, chromium, nickel, 
molybdenum, or other alloys) content (such as certain exhaust systems) 
and, based on the nature of the scrap and purchase specifications, that 
the type of scrap is not reasonably expected to contain mercury 
switches.
    (4) Scrap that does not contain motor vehicle scrap. For scrap not 
subject to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this 
section, you must certify in your notification of compliance status and 
maintain records of documentation that this scrap does not contain motor 
vehicle scrap.


<R05>
Sec. 63.10886  What are my management practices for binder formulations?

    For each furfuryl alcohol warm box mold or core making line at a new 
or existing iron and steel foundry, you must use a binder chemical 
formulation that does not use methanol as a specific ingredient of the 
catalyst formulation. This requirement does not apply to the resin 
portion of the binder system.

at the foundry or, if applicable, the maximum permitted metal melt 
production rate for the iron and steel foundry calculated on an annual 
basis. Unless otherwise specified in the permit, permitted metal melt 
production rates that are not specified on an annual basis must be 
annualized assuming 24 hours per day, 365 days per year of operation. If 
the permit limits the operating hours of the furnace(s) or foundry, then

permitted metal melt production rate.
    Annual metal melt production means the quantity of metal melted in a 
metal melting furnace or group of all metal melting furnaces at the iron 
and steel foundry in a given calendar year. For the purposes of this 
subpart, metal melt production is determined on the basis on the

metal melt production for each furnace in a given calendar year is the 
annual metal melt production of the foundry.
    Bag leak detection system means a system that is capable of 
continuously monitoring relative particulate matter (dust) loadings in 
the exhaust of a baghouse to detect bag leaks and other upset 
conditions. A bag leak detection system includes, but is not limited to,

scattering, light transmittance, or other effect to continuously monitor 
relative particulate matter loadings.
    Binder chemical means a component of a system of chemicals used to 
bind sand together into molds, mold sections, and cores through chemical 
reaction as opposed to pressure.

dryers, which solely remove moisture from metal scrap, are not 
considered to be scrap preheaters for purposes of this subpart.
    Scrap provider means the person (including a broker) who contracts 
directly with an iron and steel foundry to provide motor vehicle scrap. 
Scrap processors such as shredder operators or vehicle dismantlers that 
do not sell scrap directly to a foundry are not scrap providers.

    Vapor-tight means equipment that allows no loss of vapors. 
Compliance with vapor-tight requirements can be determined by checking 
to ensure that the concentration at a potential leak source is not equal 
to or greater than 100 percent of the Lower Explosive Limit when 
measured with a combustible gas detector, calibrated with propane, at a 
distance of 1 inch from the source.

                  Standards and Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.11147  What are the standards and compliance requirements for existing 

sources not using batch copper converters?

    (a) Emissions limits and work practice standards. (1) You must not 
discharge to the atmosphere through any combination of stacks or other 
vents captured process exhaust gases from the copper concentrate dryers, 
smelting vessels, converting vessels, matte drying and grinding plants, 
secondary gas systems, and anode refining department that contain 
particulate matter less than 10 microns in aerodynamic diameter 
(PM<INF>10</INF>) in excess of 89.5 pounds per hour (lb/hr) on a 24-hour 
average basis.
    (2) You must operate a capture system that collects the gases and 
fumes released during the transfer of molten materials from smelting 
vessels and converting vessels and conveys the collected gas stream to a 
control device.
    (3) You must operate one or more capture systems that collect the 
gases and fumes released from each vessel used to refine blister copper, 
remelt anode copper, or remelt anode scrap and convey each collected gas 
stream to a control device. One control device may be used for multiple 
collected gas streams.
    (b) Compliance requirements. For purposes of determining compliance 
with the emissions limit in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you must 
comply with the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this 
section.
    (1) You must calibrate, maintain and operate a system to 
continuously measure emissions of particulate matter (PM) from the 
smelter's main stack.
    (2) All PM collected by the smelter main stack continuous PM 
sampling system is reported as PM<INF>10</INF> unless you demonstrate to 
the satisfaction of the permitting authority that, due to an

[[Page 217]]

infrequent event, the measured PM contains a large fraction of particles 
greater than 10 microns in diameter.
    (3) To determine the mass emissions rate, the PM<INF>10</INF> 
concentration as determined by the smelter main stack continuous PM 
sampling system is multiplied by the volumetric flow rate for the 
smelter main stack and any necessary conversion factors.
    (4) Compliance with the PM<INF>10</INF> emissions limit is 
demonstrated based on the average mass PM<INF>10</INF> emissions rate 
for each 24-hour period.
    (5) The results of the PM monitoring and calculated average mass 
PM<INF>10</INF> emissions rate for each 24-hour period must be recorded 
and the records maintained for at least 5 years. Collected data must be 
available for inspection when the required laboratory analysis is 
completed.
    (6) You must submit to the permitting authority by the 20th day of 
each month a report summarizing the 24-hour average mass PM<INF>10</INF> 
emissions rates for the previous month.
    (7) You may certify initial compliance with the emissions limit in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section based on the results of PM sampling 
conducted during the previous month.
    (c) Operation and maintenance requirements. (1) At all times, 
including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, you must to the 
extent practicable, maintain and operate any affected source, including 
associated air pollution control equipment, in a manner consistent with 
good air pollution control practice for minimizing emissions. 
Determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures 
are being used will be based on information available to the permitting 
authority which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, 
opacity observations, review of operating and maintenance procedures, 
and inspection of the source.
    (2) All pollution control equipment must be installed, maintained, 
and operated properly. Instructions from the vendor or established 
maintenance practices that maximize pollution control must be followed. 
All necessary equipment control and operating devices, such as pressure 
gauges, amp meters, volt meters, flow rate indicators, temperature 
gauges, continuous emission monitors, etc., must be installed, operated 
properly, and easily accessible to compliance inspectors. A copy of all 
manufacturers' operating instructions for pollution control equipment 
and pollution emitting equipment must be maintained at your facility 
site. These instructions must be available to all employees who operate 
the equipment and must be made available to the permitting authority 
upon request. Maintenance records must be made available to the 
permitting authority upon request.
    (3) You must document the activities performed to assure proper 
operation and maintenance of the air pollution control equipment and 
monitoring systems or devices.
    (4) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, in the 
event of an emergency situation the owner or operator must comply with 
the requirements in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section. 
For the purposes of complying with this paragraph, an emergency 
situation is any situation arising from sudden and reasonably 
unforeseeable events beyond the control of the facility owner or 
operator that requires immediate corrective action to restore normal 
operation, and that causes the affected source to exceed an applicable 
emissions limitation under this subpart, due to unavoidable increases in 
emissions attributable to the emergency. An emergency must not include 
noncompliance to the extent it is caused by improperly designed 
equipment, lack of preventive maintenance, careless or improper 
operation, or operator error.
    (i) During the period of the emergency, you must implement all 
reasonable steps to minimize levels of emissions that exceed the 
emissions standards or other applicable requirements in this subpart.
    (ii) You must document through signed contemporaneous logs or other 
relevant evidence that an emergency occurred and you can identify the 
probable cause, your facility was being operated properly at the time 
the emergency occurred, and the corrective actions taken to minimize 
emissions as required by paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.

[[Page 218]]

    (iii) You must submit a notice of the emergency to the permitting 
authority within two working days of the time when emissions limitations 
were exceeded due to the emergency (or an alternate timeframe acceptable 
to the permitting authority). This notice must contain a description of 
the emergency, any steps taken to mitigate emissions, and corrective 
actions taken.
    (5) As an alternative to the requirements in paragraph (c)(4) of 
this section, you must comply with the startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction requirements in 40 CFR 63.6(e)(3).
    (d) Deviations. You must submit written notification to the 
permitting authority of any deviation from the requirements of this 
subpart, including the probable cause of such deviations and any 
corrective actions or preventative measures taken. You must submit this 
notification within 14 days of the date the deviation occurred.
    (e) Reports. You must submit semiannual monitoring reports to your 
permitting authority. All instances of deviations from the requirements 
of this subpart must be clearly identified in the reports.
    (f) Records. (1) You must retain records of all required monitoring 
data and support information. Support information includes all 
calibration and maintenance records, all original strip charts or 
appropriate recordings for continuous monitoring instrumentation, and 
copies of all reports required by this subpart. For all monitoring 
requirements, the owner or operator must record, where applicable, the 
date, place, and time of sampling or measurement; the date analyses were 
performed; the company or entity that performed the analyses; the 
analytical techniques or methods used; the results of such analyses; and 
the operating conditions existing at the time of sampling or 
measurement.
    (2) You must maintain records of the activities performed to assure 
proper operation and maintenance of the air pollution control equipment 
and monitoring systems or devices. Records of these activities must be 
maintained for at least 5 years.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11148  What are the standards and compliance requirements for existing 

sources using batch copper converters?

    (a) Emissions limits and work practice standards. (1) For each 
copper concentrate dryer, you must not discharge to the atmosphere from 
the dryer vent any gases that contain total particulate matter (PM) in 
excess of 0.022 grains per dry standard cubic foot (gr/dscf).
    (2) You must exhaust the process off gas from each smelting vessel 
to a control device according to the requirements in paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) During periods when copper ore concentrate feed is charged to 
and smelted to form molten copper matte and slag layers in the smelting 
vessel, you must exhaust the process off gas from the smelting vessel to 
a gas cleaning system controlling PM and to a sulfuric acid plant prior 
to discharge to the atmosphere.
    (ii) During periods when no copper ore concentrate feed is charged 
to the smelting vessel but the smelting vessel remains in operation to 
temporarily hold molten material in the vessel before resuming copper 
production, you must exhaust the process off gas from the smelting 
vessel to an electrostatic precipitator, wet scrubber, or baghouse prior 
to discharge to the atmosphere.
    (3) You must control the process emissions released when tapping 
copper matte or slag from a smelting vessel according to paragraphs 
(a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) You must operate a capture system that collects the gases and 
fumes released when copper matte or slag is tapped from the smelting 
vessel. The design and placement of this capture system must be such 
that the tapping port opening, launder, and receiving vessel (e.g., 
ladle, slag pot) are positioned within the confines or influence of the 
capture system's ventilation draft during those times when the copper 
matte or slag is flowing from the tapping port opening.
    (ii) You must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere from the 
capture system used to comply with paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section 
any

[[Page 219]]

gases that contain total PM in excess of 0.022 gr/dscf.
    (4) For each batch copper converter, you must meet the requirements 
in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section.
    (i) You must operate a primary capture system that collects the 
process off gas vented when one or more batch copper converters are 
blowing. If you operate a batch copper converter that does not use a 
``U''-shaped side flue located at one end of the converter, then the 
capture system design must include use of a primary hood that covers the 
entire mouth of each batch copper converter vessel when the copper 
converter is positioned for blowing. The capture system may use multiple 
intake and duct segments through which the ventilation rates are 
controlled independently of each other.
    (ii) If you operate a batch copper converter that does not use a 
``U''-shaped side flue located at one end of the converter, then you 
must operate a secondary capture system that collects gases and fumes 
released from the batch copper converter when the converter mouth is 
rotated out partially or totally from within the confines or influence 
of the primary capture system's ventilation draft during charging, 
skimming, pouring, or holding. The capture system design must use 
additional hoods (e.g., sliding secondary hoods, air curtain hoods) or 
other capture devices (e.g., building evacuation systems). The capture 
system may use multiple intake and duct segments through which the 
ventilation rates are controlled independently of each other, and 
individual duct segments may be connected to separate PM control 
devices.
    (iii) You must exhaust the process off gas captured by the primary 
capture system that is used to comply with paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this 
section to a gas cleaning system controlling PM and to a sulfuric acid 
plant prior to discharge to the atmosphere.
    (iv) For each secondary capture system that is used to comply with 
paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section and is not vented to a gas cleaning 
system controlling PM and a sulfuric acid plant, you must not cause to 
be discharged to the atmosphere any gases that contain total particulate 
matter in excess of 0.02 grains/dscf.
    (b) Monitoring requirements for electrostatic precipitators. To 
monitor the performance of each electrostatic precipitator used to 
comply with the PM emissions limits in paragraph (a) of this section, 
you must use a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) that is 
installed at the outlet of each electrostatic precipitator or a common 
duct at the outlet of multiple electrostatic precipitators.
    (1) Each COMS must meet Performance Specification 1 in 40 CFR part 
60, appendix B.
    (2) You must comply with the quality assurance requirements in 
paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (v) of this section.
    (i) You must automatically (intrinsic to the opacity monitor) check 
the zero and upscale (span) calibration drifts at least once daily. For 
a particular COMS, the acceptable range of zero and upscale calibration 
materials is as defined in the applicable version of Performance 
Specification 1 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix B.
    (ii) You must adjust the zero and span whenever the 24-hour zero 
drift or 24-hour span drift exceeds 4 percent opacity. The COMS must 
allow for the amount of excess zero and span drift measured at the 24-
hour interval checks to be recorded and quantified. The optical surfaces 
exposed to the effluent gases must be cleaned prior to performing the 
zero and span drift adjustments, except for systems using automatic zero 
adjustments. For systems using automatic zero adjustments, the optical 
surfaces must be cleaned when the cumulative automatic zero compensation 
exceeds 4 percent opacity.
    (iii) You must apply a method for producing a simulated zero opacity 
condition and an upscale (span) opacity condition using a certified 
neutral density filter or other related technique to produce a known 
obscuration of the light beam. All procedures applied must provide a 
system check of the analyzer internal optical surfaces and all 
electronic circuitry including the lamp and photodetector assembly.
    (iv) Except during periods of system breakdowns, repairs, 
calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments,

[[Page 220]]

the COMS must be in continuous operation and must complete a minimum of 
one cycle of sampling and analyzing for each successive 10 second period 
and one cycle of data recording for each successive 6-minute period.
    (v) You must reduce all data from the COMS to 6-minute averages. 
Six-minute opacity averages must be calculated from 36 or more data 
points equally spaced over each 6-minute period. Data recorded during 
periods of system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and 
span adjustments must not be included in the data averages. An 
arithmetic or integrated average of all data may be used.
    (3) You must evaluate opacity measurements from the COMS on a 24-
hour rolling average excluding periods of startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction. If the 24-hour rolling average opacity exceeds 15 percent, 
you must initiate investigation of the relevant controls or equipment 
within 24 hours of the first discovery of the high opacity incident and, 
if necessary, take corrective action as soon as practicable to adjust or 
repair the controls or equipment to reduce the opacity average to below 
the 15 percent level.
    (4) You must log in ink or electronic format and maintain a record 
of 24-hour opacity measurements performed in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section and any corrective actions taken, if any. A 
record of corrective actions taken must include the date and time during 
which the 24-hour rolling average opacity exceeded 15 percent and the 
date, time and type of the corrective action.
    (c) Monitoring requirements for baghouses. To monitor the 
performance of each baghouse used to comply with PM emissions limits in 
paragraph (a) of this section, you must use a bag leak detection system 
according to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this 
section.
    (1) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and continuously operate 
a bag leak detection system for the baghouse to monitor the baghouse 
performance.
    (2) The baghouse leak detection system must meet the specifications 
and requirements in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (v) of this section.
    (i) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the 
manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at 
concentrations that can effectively discern any dysfunctional leaks of 
the baghouse.
    (ii) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of 
relative or absolute particulate matter loadings.
    (iii) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm 
system that will sound automatically when an increase in relative 
particulate emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be 
located where it is easily heard by plant operating personnel.
    (iv) The bag leak detection system must be installed downstream of 
the baghouse.
    (v) The bag leak detection system must be installed, operated, 
calibrated, and maintained in a manner consistent with the 
manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations. The 
calibration of the system must, at a minimum, consist of establishing 
the relative baseline output level by adjusting the sensitivity and the 
averaging period of the device and establishing the alarm set points and 
the alarm delay time.
    (3) If the bag leak detection system alarm sounds, you must initiate 
investigation of the baghouse within 24 hours of the first discovery of 
the alarm and, if necessary, take corrective action as soon as 
practicable to adjust or repair the baghouse to minimize possible 
exceedances of the applicable PM emissions limits in paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (4) You must log in ink or electronic format and maintain a record 
of installation, calibration, maintenance, and operation of the bag leak 
detection system. If the bag leak detection system alarm sounds, the 
records must include an identification of the date and time of all bag 
leak detection alarms, their cause, and an explanation of the corrective 
actions taken, if any.
    (d) Alternative monitoring requirements for baghouses. As an 
alternative to the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section for bag 
leak detection systems, you must monitor the performance of each 
baghouse used to comply with a

[[Page 221]]

PM emissions limit in paragraph (a) of this section using a COMS that is 
installed at the outlet on the baghouse or a common duct at the outlet 
of multiple baghouses. Each COMS must meet the requirements in 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.
    (e) Performance testing. (1) You must demonstrate initial compliance 
with the applicable PM emissions limits in paragraph (a) of this section 
based on the results of a performance test for each affected source.
    (i) You may certify initial compliance for an affected source based 
on the results of a previous performance test conducted within the past 
12 months before your compliance date.
    (ii) If you have not conducted a performance test to demonstrate 
compliance with the applicable emissions limits within the past 12 
months before your compliance date, you must conduct a performance test 
within 180 days of your compliance date and report the results in your 
notification of compliance status.
    (2) You must demonstrate subsequent compliance with the applicable 
PM emissions limits in paragraph (a) of this section based on the

<R05>
Sec. 63.11153  Am I subject to this subpart?

    (a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a new 
secondary copper smelter that is an area source of hazardous air 
pollutant (HAP) emissions.
    (b) This subpart applies to each new affected source. The affected 
source is each secondary copper smelter. Your secondary copper smelter 
is a new affected source if you commenced constructed or reconstruction 
of the affected source on or after October 6, 2006.
    (c) This subpart does not apply to research and development 
facilities, as defined in section 112(c)(7) of the CAA.
    (d) If you own or operate an area source subject to this subpart, 
you must obtain a permit under 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71.

Sec. 63.11154  What are my compliance dates?

    (a) If you startup a new affected source on or before January 23, 
2007, you must achieve compliance with the applicable provisions of this 
subpart not later than January 23, 2007.
    (b) If you startup a new affected source after January 23, 2007, you 
must achieve compliance with the applicable provisions of this subpart 
upon startup of your affected source.

                  Standards and Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.11155  What are the standards and compliance requirements for new 

sources?

    (a) You must not discharge to the atmosphere any gases which contain 
particulate matter (PM) in excess of 0.002 grains per dry standard cubic 
foot (gr/dscf) from the exhaust vent of any capture system for a 
smelting furnace, melting furnace, or other vessel that contains molten 
material and any capture system for the transfer of molten material.
    (b) For each smelting furnace, melting furnace, or other vessel that 
contains molten material, you must install and operate a capture system 
that collects the gases and fumes from the vessel and from the transfer 
of molten material and convey the collected gas stream to a control 
device.
    (c) You must prepare and operate at all times according to a written 
plan for the selection, inspection, and pretreatment of copper scrap to 
minimize, to the extent practicable, the amount of oil and plastics in 
the scrap that is charged to the smelting furnace. Your plan must 
include a training program for scrap inspectors. You must keep records 
to demonstrate continuous compliance with the requirements of your plan. 
You must keep a current copy of your pollution prevention plan onsite 
and available for inspection.
    (d) You must install, operate, and maintain a bag leak detection 
system on all baghouses used to comply with the PM emissions limit in 
paragraph (a) of this section according to paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, prepare and operate by a site-specific monitoring plan 
according to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, take corrective action 
according to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and record information 
according to paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
    (1) Each bag leak detection system must meet the specifications and 
requirements in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (viii) of this section.
    (i) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the 
manufacturer to be capable of detecting PM emissions at concentrations 
of 1 milligram per actual cubic meter (0.00044 grains per actual cubic 
foot) or less.
    (ii) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of 
relative PM loadings. The owner or operator must continuously record the 
output from the bag leak detection system using electronic or other 
means (e.g., using a strip chart recorder or a data logger.)

[[Page 230]]

    (iii) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm 
system that will sound when the system detects an increase in relative 
particulate loading over the alarm set point established according to 
paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section, and the alarm must be located such 
that it can be heard by the appropriate plant personnel.
    (iv) In the initial adjustment of the bag leak detection system, you 
must establish, at a minimum, the baseline output by adjusting the 
sensitivity (range) and the averaging period of the device, the alarm 
set points, and the alarm delay time.
    (v) Following initial adjustment, you must not adjust the averaging 
period, alarm set point, or alarm delay time without approval from the 
Administrator or delegated authority except as provided in paragraph 
(d)(1)(vi) of this section.
    (vi) Once per quarter, you may adjust the sensitivity of the bag 
leak detection system to account for seasonal effects, including 
temperature and humidity, according to the procedures identified in the 
site-specific monitoring plan required by paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section.
    (vii) You must install the bag leak detection sensor downstream of 
the baghouse and upstream of any wet scrubber.
    (viii) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's 
instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
    (2) You must develop and submit to the Administrator or delegated 
authority for approval a site-specific monitoring plan for each bag leak 
detection system. You must operate and maintain the bag leak detection 
system according to the site-specific monitoring plan at all times. Each 
monitoring plan must describe the items in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through 
(vi) of this section.
    (i) Installation of the bag leak detection system;
    (ii) Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection 
system, including how the alarm set-point will be established;
    (iii) Operation of the bag leak detection system, including quality 
assurance procedures;
    (iv) How the bag leak detection system will be maintained, including 
a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list;
    (v) How the bag leak detection system output will be recorded and 
stored; and
    (vi) Corrective action procedures as specified in paragraph (d)(3) 
of this section. In approving the site-specific monitoring plan, the 
Administrator or delegated authority may allow owners and operators more 
than 3 hours to alleviate a specific condition that causes an alarm if 
the owner or operator identifies in the monitoring plan this specific 
condition as one that could lead to an alarm, adequately explains why it 
is not feasible to alleviate this specific condition within 3 hours of 
the time the alarm occurs, and demonstrates that the requested time will 
ensure alleviation of this condition as expeditiously as practicable.
    (3) For each bag leak detection system, you must initiate procedures 
to determine the cause of every alarm within 1 hour of the alarm. Except 
as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(vi) of this section, you must alleviate 
the cause of the alarm within 3 hours of the alarm by taking whatever 
corrective action(s) are necessary. Corrective actions may include, but 
are not limited to the following:
    (i) Inspecting the baghouse for air leaks, torn or broken bags or 
filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in 
particulate emissions;
    (ii) Sealing off defective bags or filter media;
    (iii) Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise 
repairing the control device;
    (iv) Sealing off a defective baghouse compartment;

time that procedures to determine the cause of an alarm were initiated, 
whether procedures were initiated within 1 hour of the alarm, the cause 
of the alarm, an explanation of the actions taken, the date and time the 
cause of the alarm was alleviated, and whether the alarm was alleviated 
within 3 hours of the alarm.
    (e) You must conduct a performance test to demonstrate initial 
compliance with the PM emissions limit within 180 days after startup and 
report the results in your notification of compliance status. You must 
conduct each PM test according to Sec. 63.7(e)(1) using the test 
methods and procedures in paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) of this section.
    (1) Method 1 or 1A (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to select sampling 
port locations and the number of traverse points in each stack or duct. 
Sampling sites must be located at the outlet of the control device (or 
at the outlet of the emissions source if no control device is present) 
prior to any releases to the atmosphere.
    (2) Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to 
determine the volumetric flow rate of the stack gas.
    (3) Method 3, 3A, or 3B (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to determine 
the dry molecular weight of the stack gas. You may use ANSI/ASME PTC 
19.10-1981, ``Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses (incorporated by reference--
see Sec. 63.14) as an alternative to EPA Method 3B.
    (4) Method 4 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to determine the moisture 
content of the stack gas.
    (5) Method 5 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to determine the PM 
concentration for negative pressure baghouses and Method 5D (40 CFR part 
60, appendix A) for positive pressure baghouses. The sampling time and 
volume for each run must be at least 60 minutes and 0.85 dry standard 
cubic meters (30 dry standard cubic feet). A minimum of three valid test 
runs are needed to comprise a PM performance test.
    (f) You must conduct subsequent performance tests to demonstrate 
compliance with the PM emissions limit at least once every 5 years.
    (g) If you use a control device other than a baghouse, you must 
prepare and submit a monitoring plan to the Administrator for approval.

establishes national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants 
(HAP) for area sources involved in any of the activities in paragraphs 
(a) through (c) of this section. This subpart also establishes 
requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the 
emission standards contained herein.
    (a) Paint stripping operations that involve the use of chemical 
strippers that contain methylene chloride (MeCl), Chemical Abstract 
Service number 75092, in paint removal processes;
    (b) Autobody refinishing operations that encompass motor vehicle and 
mobile equipment spray-applied surface coating operations;
    (c) Spray application of coatings containing compounds of chromium 
(Cr), lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), or cadmium (Cd), 
collectively referred to as the target HAP to any part or product made 
of metal or plastic, or combinations of metal and plastic that are not 
motor vehicles or mobile equipment.
    (d) This subpart does not apply to any of the activities described 
in paragraph (d)(1) through (6) of this section.
    (1) Surface coating or paint stripping performed on site at 
installations owned or operated by the Armed Forces of the United States 
(including the Coast Guard and the National Guard of any such State), 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or the National 
Nuclear Security Administration.

[[Page 244]]

    (2) Surface coating or paint stripping of military munitions, as 
defined in Sec. 63.11180, manufactured by or for the Armed Forces of 
the United States (including the Coast Guard and the National Guard of 
any such State) or equipment directly and exclusively used for the 
purposes of transporting military munitions.
    (3) Surface coating or paint stripping performed by individuals on 
their personal vehicles, possessions, or property, either as a hobby or 
for maintenance of their personal vehicles, possessions, or property. 
This subpart also does not apply when these operations are performed by 
individuals for others without compensation. An individual who spray 
applies surface coating to more than two motor vehicles or pieces of 
mobile equipment per year is subject to the requirements in this subpart 
that pertain to motor vehicle and mobile equipment surface coating 
regardless of whether compensation is received.
    (4) Surface coating or paint stripping that meets the definition of 
``research and laboratory activities'' in Sec. 63.11180.
    (5) Surface coating or paint stripping that meets the definition of 
``quality control activities'' in Sec. 63.11180.
    (6) Surface coating or paint stripping activities that are covered 
under another area source NESHAP.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11170  Am I subject to this subpart?

    (a) You are subject to this subpart if you operate an area source of 
HAP as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, including sources that 
are part of a tribal, local, State, or Federal facility and you perform 
one or more of the activities in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this 
section:
    (1) Perform paint stripping using MeCl for the removal of dried 
paint (including, but not limited to, paint, enamel, varnish, shellac, 
and lacquer) from wood, metal, plastic, and other substrates.
    (2) Perform spray application of coatings, as defined in Sec. 
63.11180, to motor vehicles and mobile equipment including operations 
that are located in stationary structures at fixed locations, and mobile 
repair and refinishing operations that travel to the customer's 
location, except spray coating applications that meet the definition of 
facility maintenance in Sec. 63.11180. However, if you are the owner or 
operator of a motor vehicle or mobile equipment surface coating 
operation, you may petition the Administrator for an exemption from this 
subpart if you can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator, that you spray apply no coatings that contain the target 
HAP, as defined in Sec. 63.11180. Petitions must include a description 
of the coatings that you spray apply and your certification that you do 
not spray apply any coatings containing the target HAP. If circumstances 
change such that you intend to spray apply coatings containing the 
target HAP, you must submit the initial notification required by 
63.11175 and comply with the requirements of this subpart.
    (3) Perform spray application of coatings that contain the target 
HAP, as defined in Sec. 63.11180, to a plastic and/or metal substrate 
on a part or product, except spray coating applications that meet the 
definition of facility maintenance or space vehicle in Sec. 63.11180.
    (b) An area source of HAP is a source of HAP that is not a major 
source of HAP, is not located at a major source, and is not part of a 
major source of HAP emissions. A major source of HAP emissions is any 
stationary source or group of stationary sources located within a 
contiguous area and under common control that emits or has the potential 
to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (Mg) (10 tons) or 
more per year, or emit any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 Mg (25 
tons) or more per year.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11171  How do I know if my source is considered a new source or an 

existing source?

    (a) This subpart applies to each new and existing affected area 
source engaged in the activities listed in Sec. 63.11170, with the 
exception of those activities listed in Sec. 63.11169(d) of this 
subpart.
    (b) The affected source is the collection of all of the items listed 
in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section. Not all affected 
sources will have all of the items listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through 
(6) of this section.

[[Page 245]]

    (1) Mixing rooms and equipment;
    (2) Spray booths, ventilated prep stations, curing ovens, and 
associated equipment;
    (3) Spray guns and associated equipment;
    (4) Spray gun cleaning equipment;
    (5) Equipment used for storage, handling, recovery, or recycling of 
cleaning solvent or waste paint; and
    (6) Equipment used for paint stripping at paint stripping facilities 
using paint strippers containing MeCl.
    (c) An affected source is a new source if it meets the criteria in 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.
    (1) You commenced the construction of the source after September 17, 
2007 by installing new paint stripping or surface coating equipment. If 
you purchase and install spray booths, enclosed spray gun cleaners, 
paint stripping equipment to reduce MeCl emissions, or purchase new 
spray guns to comply with this subpart at an existing source, these 
actions would not make your existing source a new source.
    (2) The new paint stripping or surface coating equipment is used at 
a source that was not actively engaged in paint stripping and/or 
miscellaneous surface coating prior to September 17, 2007.
    (d) An affected source is reconstructed if it meets the definition 
of reconstruction in Sec. 63.2.
    (e) An affected source is an existing source if it is not a new 
source or a reconstructed source.

                     General Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.11172  When do I have to comply with this subpart?

    The date by which you must comply with this subpart is called the 
compliance date. The compliance date for each type of affected source is 
specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (a) For a new or reconstructed affected source, the compliance date 
is the applicable date in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section:
    (1) If the initial startup of your new or reconstructed affected 
source is after September 17, 2007, the compliance date is January 9, 
2008.
    (2) If the initial startup of your new or reconstructed affected 
source occurs after January 9, 2008, the compliance date is the date of 
initial startup of your affected source.
    (b) For an existing affected source, the compliance date is January 
10, 2011.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11173  What are my general requirements for complying with this 

subpart?

    (a) Each paint stripping operation that is an affected area source 
must implement management practices to minimize the evaporative 
emissions of MeCl. The management practices must address, at a minimum, 
the practices in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section, as 
applicable, for your operations.
    (1) Evaluate each application to ensure there is a need for paint 
stripping (e.g., evaluate whether it is possible to re-coat the piece 
without removing the existing coating).
    (2) Evaluate each application where a paint stripper containing MeCl 
is used to ensure that there is no alternative paint stripping 
technology that can be used.
    (3) Reduce exposure of all paint strippers containing MeCl to the 
air.
    (4) Optimize application conditions when using paint strippers 
containing MeCl to reduce MeCl evaporation (e.g., if the stripper must 
be heated, make sure that the temperature is kept as low as possible to 
reduce evaporation).
    (5) Practice proper storage and disposal of paint strippers 
containing MeCl (e.g., store stripper in closed, air-tight containers).
    (b) Each paint stripping operation that has annual usage of more 
than one ton of MeCl must develop and implement a written MeCl 
minimization plan to minimize the use and emissions of MeCl. The MeCl 
minimization plan must address, at a minimum, the management practices 
specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section, as 
applicable, for your operations. Each operation must post a placard or 
sign outlining the MeCl minimization plan in each area where paint 
stripping operations subject to this subpart occur. Paint stripping 
operations with annual usage of less than one ton of MeCl, must comply 
with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this

[[Page 246]]

section, as applicable, but are not required to develop and implement a 
written MeCl minimization plan.
    (c) Each paint stripping operation must maintain copies of annual 
usage of paint strippers containing MeCl on site at all times.
    (d) Each paint stripping operation with annual usage of more than 
one ton of MeCl must maintain a copy of their current MeCl minimization 
plan on site at all times.
    (e) Each motor vehicle and mobile equipment surface coating 
operation and each miscellaneous surface coating operation must meet the 
requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(5) of this section.
    (1) All painters must be certified that they have completed training 
in the proper spray application of surface coatings and the proper setup 
and maintenance of spray equipment. The minimum requirements for 
training and certification are described in paragraph (f) of this 
section. The spray application of surface coatings is prohibited by 
persons who are not certified as having completed the training described 
in paragraph (f) of this section. The requirements of this paragraph do 
not apply to the students of an accredited surface coating training 
program who are under the direct supervision of an instructor who meets 
the requirements of this paragraph.
    (2) All spray-applied coatings must be applied in a spray booth, 
preparation station, or mobile enclosure that meets the requirements of 
paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section and either paragraph (e)(2)(ii), 
(e)(2)(iii), or (e)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (i) All spray booths, preparation stations, and mobile enclosures 
must be fitted with a type of filter technology that is demonstrated to 
achieve at least 98-percent capture of paint overspray. The procedure 
used to demonstrate filter efficiency must be consistent with the 
American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning 
Engineers (ASHRAE) Method 52.1, ``Gravimetric and Dust-Spot Procedures 
for Testing Air-Cleaning Devices Used in General Ventilation for 
Removing Particulate Matter, June 4, 1992'' (incorporated by reference, 
see Sec. 63.14 of subpart A of this part). The test coating for 
measuring filter efficiency shall be a high solids bake enamel delivered 
at a rate of at least 135 grams per minute from a conventional (non-
HVLP) air-atomized spray gun operating at 40 pounds per square inch 
(psi) air pressure; the air flow rate across the filter shall be 150 
feet per minute. Owners and operators may use published filter 
efficiency data provided by filter vendors to demonstrate compliance 
with this requirement and are not required to perform this measurement. 
The requirements of this paragraph do not apply to waterwash spray 
booths that are operated and maintained according to the manufacturer's 
specifications.
    (ii) Spray booths and preparation stations used to refinish complete 
motor vehicles or mobile equipment must be fully enclosed with a full 
roof, and four complete walls or complete side curtains, and must be 
ventilated at negative pressure so that air is drawn into any openings 
in the booth walls or preparation station curtains. However, if a spray 
booth is fully enclosed and has seals on all doors and other openings 
and has an automatic pressure balancing system, it may be operated at up 
to, but not more than, 0.05 inches water gauge positive pressure.
    (iii) Spray booths and preparation stations that are used to coat 
miscellaneous parts and products or vehicle subassemblies must have a 
full roof, at least three complete walls or complete side curtains, and 
must be ventilated so that air is drawn into the booth. The walls and 
roof of a booth may have openings, if needed, to allow for conveyors and 
parts to pass through the booth during the coating process.
    (iv) Mobile ventilated enclosures that are used to perform spot 
repairs must enclose and, if necessary, seal against the surface around 
the area being coated such that paint overspray is retained within the 
enclosure and directed to a filter to capture paint overspray.
    (3) All spray-applied coatings must be applied with a high volume, 
low pressure (HVLP) spray gun, electrostatic application, airless spray 
gun, air-assisted airless spray gun, or an equivalent technology that is 
demonstrated by the spray gun manufacturer to

[[Page 247]]

achieve transfer efficiency comparable to one of the spray gun 
technologies listed above for a comparable operation, and for which 
written approval has been obtained from the Administrator. The procedure 
used to demonstrate that spray gun transfer efficiency is equivalent to 
that of an HVLP spray gun must be equivalent to the California South 
Coast Air Quality Management District's ``Spray Equipment Transfer 
Efficiency Test Procedure for Equipment User, May 24, 1989'' and 
``Guidelines for Demonstrating Equivalency with District Approved 
Transfer Efficient Spray Guns, September 26, 2002'' (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 63.14 of subpart A of this part). The requirements 
of this paragraph do not apply to painting performed by students and 
instructors at paint training centers. The requirements of this 
paragraph do not apply to the surface coating of aerospace vehicles that 
involves the coating of components that normally require the use of an 
airbrush or an extension on the spray gun to properly reach limited 
access spaces; to the application of coatings on aerospace vehicles that 
contain fillers that adversely affect atomization with HVLP spray guns; 
or to the application of coatings on aerospace vehicles that normally 
have a dried film thickness of less than 0.0013 centimeter (0.0005 in.).
    (4) All paint spray gun cleaning must be done so that an atomized 
mist or spray of gun cleaning solvent and paint residue is not created 
outside of a container that collects used gun cleaning solvent. Spray 
gun cleaning may be done with, for example, hand cleaning of parts of 
the disassembled gun in a container of solvent, by flushing solvent 
through the gun without atomizing the solvent and paint residue, or by 
using a fully enclosed spray gun washer. A combination of non-atomizing 
methods may also be used.
    (5) As provided in Sec. 63.6(g), we, the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, may choose to grant you permission to use an 
alternative to the emission standards in this section after you have 
requested approval to do so according to Sec. 63.6(g)(2).
    (f) Each owner or operator of an affected miscellaneous surface 
coating source must ensure and certify that all new and existing 
personnel, including contract personnel, who spray apply surface 
coatings, as defined in Sec. 63.11180, are trained in the proper 
application of surface coatings as required by paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section. The training program must include, at a minimum, the items 
listed in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section.
    (1) A list of all current personnel by name and job description who 
are required to be trained;
    (2) Hands-on and classroom instruction that addresses, at a minimum, 
initial and refresher training in the topics listed in paragraphs 
(f)(2)(i) through (2)(iv) of this section.
    (i) Spray gun equipment selection, set up, and operation, including 
measuring coating viscosity, selecting the proper fluid tip or nozzle, 
and achieving the proper spray pattern, air pressure and volume, and 
fluid delivery rate.
    (ii) Spray technique for different types of coatings to improve 
transfer efficiency and minimize coating usage and overspray, including 
maintaining the correct spray gun distance and angle to the part, using 
proper banding and overlap, and reducing lead and lag spraying at the 
beginning and end of each stroke.
    (iii) Routine spray booth and filter maintenance, including filter 
selection and installation.
    (iv) Environmental compliance with the requirements of this subpart.
    (3) A description of the methods to be used at the completion of 
initial or refresher training to demonstrate, document, and provide 
certification of successful completion of the required training. Owners 
and operators who can show by documentation or certification that a 
painter's work experience and/or training has resulted in training 
equivalent to the training required in paragraph (f)(2) of this section 
are not required to provide the initial training required by that 
paragraph to these painters.
    (g) As required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, all new and 
existing personnel at an affected motor vehicle and mobile equipment or 
miscellaneous

[[Page 248]]

surface coating source, including contract personnel, who spray apply 
surface coatings, as defined in Sec. 63.11180, must be trained by the 
dates specified in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section. Employees 
who transfer within a company to a position as a painter are subject to 
the same requirements as a new hire.
    (1) If your source is a new source, all personnel must be trained 
and certified no later than 180 days after hiring or no later than July 
7, 2008, whichever is later. Painter training that was completed within 
five years prior to the date training is required, and that meets the 
requirements specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section satisfies 
this requirement and is valid for a period not to exceed five years 
after the date the training is completed.
    (2) If your source is an existing source, all personnel must be 
trained and certified no later than 180 days after hiring or no later 
than January 10, 2011, whichever is later. Painter training that was 
completed within five years prior to the date training is required, and 
that meets the requirements specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section satisfies this requirement and is valid for a period not to 
exceed five years after the date the training is completed.
    (3) Training and certification will be valid for a period not to 
exceed five years after the date the training is completed, and all 
personnel must receive refresher training that meets the requirements of 
this section and be re-certified every five years.

and the street address where compliance records are maintained, if 
different. If the source is a motor vehicle or mobile equipment surface 
coating operation that repairs vehicles at the customer's location, 
rather than at a fixed location, such as a collision repair shop, the 
notification should state this and indicate the physical location where 
records are kept to demonstrate compliance;
    (4) An identification of the relevant standard (i.e., this subpart, 
40 CFR part 63, subpart HHHHHH);
    (5) A brief description of the type of operation as specified in 
paragraph (a)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section.
    (i) For all surface coating operations, indicate whether the source 
is a motor vehicle and mobile equipment surface coating operation or a 
miscellaneous surface coating operation, and include the number of spray 
booths and preparation stations, and the number of painters usually 
employed at the operation.

[[Page 249]]

    (ii) For paint stripping operations, identify the method(s) of paint 
stripping employed (e.g., chemical, mechanical) and the substrates 
stripped (e.g., wood, plastic, metal).
    (6) Each paint stripping operation must indicate whether they plan 
to annually use more than one ton of MeCl after the compliance date.
    (7) A statement of whether the source is already in compliance with 
each of the relevant requirements of this subpart, or whether the source 
will be brought into compliance by the compliance date. For paint 
stripping operations, the relevant requirements that you must evaluate 
in making this determination are specified in Sec. 63.11173(a) through 
(d) of this subpart. For surface coating operations, the relevant 
requirements are specified in Sec. 63.11173(e) through (g) of this 
subpart.
    (8) If your source is a new source, you must certify in the initial 
notification whether the source is in compliance with each of the 
requirements of this subpart. If your source is an existing source, you 
may certify in the initial notification that the source is already in 
compliance. If you are certifying in the initial notification that the 
source is in compliance with the relevant requirements of this subpart, 
then include also a statement by a responsible official with that 
official's name, title, phone number, e-mail address (if available) and 
signature, certifying the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the 
notification, a statement that the source has complied with all the 
relevant standards of this subpart, and that this initial notification 
also serves as the notification of compliance status.
    (b) Notification of Compliance Status. If you are the owner or 
operator of a new source, you are not required to submit a separate 
notification of compliance status in addition to the initial 
notification specified in paragraph (a) of this subpart provided you 
were able to certify compliance on the date of the initial notification, 
as part of the initial notification, and your compliance status has not 
since changed. If you are the owner or operator of any existing source 
and did not certify in the initial notification that your source is 
already in compliance as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, 
then you must submit a notification of compliance status. You must 
submit a Notification of Compliance Status on or before March 11, 2011. 
You are required to submit the information specified in paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (4) of this section with your Notification of Compliance 
Status:
    (1) Your company's name and the street address (physical location) 
of the affected source and the street address where compliance records 
are maintained, if different.
    (2) The name, title, address, telephone, e-mail address (if 
available) and signature of the owner and operator, or other certifying 
company official, certifying the truth, accuracy, and completeness of 
the notification and a statement of whether the source has complied with 
all the relevant standards and other requirements of this subpart or an 
explanation of any noncompliance and a description of corrective actions 
being taken to achieve compliance. For paint stripping operations, the 
relevant requirements that you must evaluate in making this 
determination are specified in Sec. 63.11173(a) through (d). For 
surface coating operations, the relevant requirements are specified in 
Sec. 63.11173(e) through (g).
    (3) The date of the Notification of Compliance Status.
    (4) If you are the owner or operator of an existing affected paint 
stripping source that annually uses more than one ton of MeCl, you must 
submit a statement certifying that you have developed and are 
implementing a written MeCl minimization plan in accordance with Sec. 
63.11173(b).


<R05>
Sec. 63.11176  What reports must I submit?

    (a) Annual Notification of Changes Report. If you are the owner or 
operator of a paint stripping, motor vehicle or mobile equipment, or 
miscellaneous surface coating affected source, you are required to 
submit a report in each calendar year in which information previously 
submitted in either the initial notification required by Sec. 
63.11175(a), Notification of Compliance, or a previous annual 
notification of changes report submitted under this paragraph, has

Sec. 63.11180  What definitions do I need to know?

    Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in 40 
CFR 63.2, and in this section as follows:
    Additive means a material that is added to a coating after purchase 
from a supplier (e.g., catalysts, activators, accelerators).
    Administrator means, for the purposes of this rulemaking, the 
Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or the State 
or local agency that is granted delegation for implementation of this 
subpart.

part, assembly of parts, or completed unit, with the exception of 
electronic components, of any aircraft including but not limited to 
airplanes, helicopters, missiles, rockets, and space vehicles.
    Airless and air-assisted airless spray mean any paint spray 
technology that relies solely on the fluid pressure of the paint to 
create an atomized paint spray pattern and does not apply any atomizing 
compressed air to the paint before it leaves the paint nozzle. Air-
assisted airless spray uses compressed air to shape and distribute the 
fan of atomized paint, but still uses fluid pressure to create the 
atomized paint.
    Appurtenance means any accessory to a stationary structure coated at 
the site of installation, whether installed or detached, including but 
not limited to: bathroom and kitchen fixtures; cabinets; concrete forms; 
doors; elevators; fences; hand railings; heating equipment, air 
conditioning equipment, and other fixed mechanical equipment or 
stationary tools; lamp posts; partitions; pipes and piping systems; rain 
gutters and downspouts; stairways, fixed ladders, catwalks, and fire 
escapes; and window screens.
    Architectural coating means a coating to be applied to stationary 
structures or their appurtenances at the site of installation, to 
portable buildings at the site of installation, to pavements, or to 
curbs.
    Cleaning material means a solvent used to remove contaminants and 
other materials, such as dirt, grease, or oil, from a substrate before 
or after coating application or from equipment associated with a coating 
operation, such as spray booths, spray guns, racks, tanks, and hangers. 
Thus, it includes any cleaning material used on substrates or equipment 
or both.

equipment or structures, and the application of any surface coating as 
part of janitorial activities. Facility maintenance includes the 
application of coatings to stationary structures or their appurtenances 
at the site of installation, to portable buildings at the site of 
installation, to pavements, or to curbs. Facility maintenance also 
includes the refinishing of mobile equipment in the field or at the site 
where they are used in service and at which they are intended to remain 
indefinitely after refinishing. Such mobile equipment includes, but is 
not limited to, farm equipment and mining equipment for which it is not 
practical or feasible to move to a dedicated mobile equipment 
refinishing facility. Such mobile equipment also includes items, such as 
fork trucks, that are used in a manufacturing facility and which are 
refinished in that same facility. Facility maintenance does not include 
surface coating of motor vehicles, mobile equipment, or items that

    Miscellaneous surface coating operation means the collection of 
equipment used to apply surface coating to miscellaneous parts and/or 
products made of metal or plastic, including applying cleaning solvents 
to prepare the surface before coating application, mixing coatings 
before application, applying coating to a surface, drying or curing the 
coating after application, and cleaning coating application equipment, 
but not plating. A single surface coating operation may include any 
combination of these types of equipment, but always includes at least 
the point at which a coating material is applied to a given part. A 
surface coating operation includes all other steps (such as surface 
preparation with solvent and equipment cleaning) in the affected source 
where HAP are emitted from the coating of a part. The use of solvent to 
clean parts (for example, to remove grease during a mechanical repair) 
does not constitute a miscellaneous surface coating operation if no 
coatings are applied. A single affected source may have multiple surface 
coating operations. Surface coatings applied to wood, leather, rubber, 
ceramics, stone, masonry, or substrates other than metal and plastic are 
not considered miscellaneous surface coating operations for the purposes 
of this subpart.
    Mobile equipment means any device that may be drawn and/or driven on 
a roadway including, but not limited to, heavy-duty trucks, truck 
trailers, fleet delivery trucks, buses, mobile cranes, bulldozers,

Sec. 63.11398  What definitions apply to this subpart?

    Acrylic fiber means a manufactured synthetic fiber in which the 
fiber-forming substance is any long-chain synthetic polymer composed of 
at least 85 percent by weight of acrylonitrile units.
    Acrylic and modacrylic fibers production means the production of 
either of the following synthetic fibers composed of acrylonitrile 
units: acrylic fiber or modacrylic fiber.
    Acrylonitrile solution polymerization means a process where 
acrylonitrile and comonomers are dissolved in a solvent to form a 
polymer solution (typically polyacrylonitrile). The polyacrylonitrile is 
soluble in the solvent. In contrast to suspension polymerization, the 
resulting reactor polymer solution (spin dope) is filtered and pumped 
directly to the fiber spinning process.
    Acrylonitrile suspension polymerization means a polymerization 
process where small drops of acrylonitrile and comonomers are suspended 
in water in the presence of a catalyst where they polymerize under 
agitation. Solid beads of polymer are formed in this suspension reaction 
which are subsequently filtered, washed, refiltered, and dried. The 
beads must be subsequently redissolved in a solvent to create a spin 
dope prior to introduction to the fiber spinning process.
    Deviation means any instance in which an affected source subject to 
this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:
    (1) Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this 
subpart, including but not limited to any emissions limitation or 
management practice;
    (2) Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement 
an applicable requirement in this subpart and that is included in the 
operating

[[Page 262]]

permit for any affected source required to obtain such a permit; or
    (3) Fails to meet any emissions limitation or management practice in 
this subpart during startup, shutdown, or malfunction, regardless of 
whether or not such failure is permitted by this subpart.
    Equipment means each of the following that is subject to this 
subpart: pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling 
collection system, open-ended valve or line, valve connector, 
instrumentation system in organic HAP service which contains or contacts 
greater than 10 percent by weight of acrylonitrile and operates more 
than 300 hours per year.
    Fiber spinning line means the group of equipment and process vents 
associated with acrylic or modacrylic fiber spinning operations. The 
fiber spinning line includes (as applicable to the type of spinning 
process used) the blending and dissolving tanks, spinning solution 
filters, wet spinning units, spin bath tanks, and the equipment used 
downstream of the spin bath to wash, dry, or draw the spun fiber.
    Maintenance wastewater means wastewater generated by the draining of 
process fluid from components in the process unit, whose primary product 
is a product produced by a source category subject to this subpart, into 
an individual drain system prior to or during maintenance activities. 
Maintenance wastewater can be generated during planned and unplanned 
shutdowns and during periods not associated with a shutdown. Examples of 
activities that can generate maintenance wastewaters include descaling 
of heat exchanger tubing bundles, cleaning of distillation column traps, 
draining of low legs and high point bleeds, draining of pumps into an 
individual drain system, and draining of portions of the process unit, 
whose primary product is a product produced by a source category subject 
to this subpart, for repair.
    Modacrylic fiber means a manufactured synthetic fiber in which the 
fiber-forming substance is any long-chain synthetic polymer composed of 
at least 35 percent by weight of acrylonitrile units but less than 85 
percent by weight of acrylonitrile units.
    Monomer recovery process equipment means the collection of process 
units and associated process equipment used to reclaim the monomer for 
subsequent reuse, including but not limited to polymer holding tanks, 
polymer buffer tanks, monomer vacuum pump flush drum, and drum filter 
vacuum pump flush drum.

units and associated process equipment used in the acrylonitrile 
polymerization process prior to the fiber spinning line, including but 
not limited to acrylonitrile storage tanks, recovered monomer tanks, 
monomer measuring tanks, monomer preparation tanks, monomer feed tanks, 
slurry receiver tanks, polymerization reactors, and drum filters.
    Process vent means the point of discharge to the atmosphere (or 
point of entry into a control device, if any) of a gas stream from the 
acrylic and modacrylic fibers production process.
    Process wastewater means wastewater, which during manufacturing or 
processing, comes into direct contact with or results from the 
production or use of any raw material, intermediate product, finished 
product, by-product, or waste product.
    Responsible official means responsible official as defined at 40 CFR 
70.2.
    Spin dope means the liquid mixture of polymer and solvent that is 
fed to the spinneret to form the acrylic and modacrylic fibers.

Administrator or delegated authority may allow owners and operators more 
than 3 hours to alleviate a specific condition that causes an alarm if 
the owner or operator identifies in the monitoring plan this specific 
condition as one that could lead to an alarm, adequately explains why it 
is not feasible to alleviate this condition within 3 hours of the time 
the alarm occurs, and demonstrates that the requested time will ensure 
alleviation of this condition as expeditiously as practicable.
    (3) For each bag leak detection system, you must initiate procedures 
to determine the cause of every alarm within 1 hour of the alarm. Except 
as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(vi) of this section, you must alleviate

manufacturing.
    Chromite ore means an oxide of chromium and iron 
(FeCr<INF>2</INF>O<INF>4</INF>) that is the primary feedstock for 
chromium compounds manufacturing.
    Chromic oxide means Cr<INF>2</INF>O<INF>3</INF>. In the production 
of chromic oxide, ammonium sulfate and sodium dichromate that have been 
concentrated by evaporation are mixed and fed to a rotary roasting kiln 
to produce chromic oxide, sodium sulfate and nitrogen gas.
    Roasting means a heating (oxidizing) process where ground chromite 
ore is mixed with alkaline material (such as soda ash, sodium 
bicarbonate, and sodium hydroxide) and fed to a rotary kiln where it is 
heated to about 2,000 F, converting the majority of the chromium in the 
ore from trivalent to hexavalent chromium.
    Sodium chromate means Na<INF>2</INF>CrO<INF>4</INF>. It is produced 
by roasting chromite ore in a rotary kiln.
    Sodium dichromate means sodium bichromate or sodium bichromate

            for Lead Acid Battery Manufacturing Area Sources

    Source: 72 FR 38913, July 16, 2007, unless otherwise noted.

                   Applicability and Compliance Dates


<R05>
Sec. 63.11421  Am I subject to this subpart?

    (a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a lead 
acid battery manufacturing plant that is an area source of hazardous air 
pollutants (HAP) emissions.
    (b) This subpart applies to each new or existing affected source. 
The affected source is each lead acid battery manufacturing plant. The 
affected source includes all grid casting facilities, paste mixing 
facilities, three-process operation facilities, lead oxide manufacturing 
facilities, lead reclamation facilities, and any other lead-emitting 
operation that is associated with the lead acid battery manufacturing 
plant.
    (1) An affected source is existing if you commenced construction or 
reconstruction of the affected source on or before April 4, 2007.

[[Page 280]]

    (2) An affected source is new if you commenced construction or 
reconstruction of the affected source after April 4, 2007.
    (c) This subpart does not apply to research and development 
facilities, as defined in section 112(c)(7) of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
    (d) You are exempt from the obligation to obtain a permit under 40 
CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71, provided you are not otherwise required 
by law to obtain a permit under 40 CFR 70.3(a) or 40 CFR 71.3(a). 
Notwithstanding the previous sentence, you must continue to comply with 
the provisions of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11422  What are my compliance dates?

    (a) If you own or operate an existing affected source, you must 
achieve compliance with the applicable provisions in this subpart by no 
later than July 16, 2008.
    (b) If you startup a new affected source on or before July 16, 2007, 
you must achieve compliance with the applicable provisions in this 
subpart not later than July 16, 2007.
    (c) If you startup a new affected source after July 16, 2007, you 
must achieve compliance with the provisions in this subpart upon startup 
of your affected source.

                  Standards and Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.11423  What are the standards and compliance requirements for new and 

existing sources?

    (a) You must meet all the standards for lead in 40 CFR 60.372.
    (b) You must meet the monitoring requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) 
and (2) of this section.
    (1) For any emissions point controlled by a scrubbing system, you 
must meet the requirements in 40 CFR 60.373.
    (2) For any emissions point controlled by a fabric filter, you must 
meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and either 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section. Fabric filters equipped 
with a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter or other secondary 
filter are allowed to monitor less frequently, as specified in paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (i) You must perform semiannual inspections and maintenance to 
ensure proper performance of each fabric filter. This includes 
inspection of structural and filter integrity. You must record the 
results of these inspections.
    (ii) You must install, maintain, and operate a pressure drop 
monitoring device to measure the differential pressure drop across the 
fabric filter during all times when the process is operating. The 
pressure drop shall be recorded at least once per day. If a pressure 
drop is observed outside of the normal operational ranges, you must 
record the incident and take immediate corrective actions. You must also 
record the corrective actions taken. You must submit a monitoring system 
performance report in accordance with Sec. 63.10(e)(3).
    (iii) You must conduct a visible emissions observation at least once 
per day to verify that no visible emissions are occurring at the 
discharge point to the atmosphere from any emissions source subject to 
the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. If visible emissions 
are detected, you must record the incident and conduct an opacity 
measurement in accordance with 40 CFR 60.374(b)(3). You must record the 
results of each opacity measurement. If the measurement exceeds the 
applicable opacity standard in 40 CFR 60.372(a)(7) or (8), you must 
submit this information in an excess emissions report required under 
Sec. 63.10(e)(3).
    (iv) Fabric filters equipped with a HEPA filter or other secondary 
filter are allowed to monitor less frequently, as specified in paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section.
    (A) If you are using a pressure drop monitoring device to measure 
the differential pressure drop across the fabric filter in accordance 
with paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, you must record the pressure 
drop at least once per week. If a pressure drop is observed outside of 
the normal operational ranges, you must record the incident and take 
immediate corrective actions. You must also record the corrective 
actions taken. You must submit a monitoring system performance report in 
accordance with Sec. 63.10(e)(3).

[[Page 281]]

    (B) If you are conducting visible emissions observations in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, you must conduct 
such observations at least once per week and record the results in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section. If visible 
emissions are detected, you must record the incident and conduct an 
opacity measurement in accordance with 40 CFR 60.374(b)(3). You must 
record the results of each opacity measurement. If the measurement 
exceeds the applicable opacity standard in 40 CFR 60.372(a)(7) or (8), 
you must submit this information in an excess emissions report required 
under Sec. 63.10(e)(3).
    (c) You must meet the testing requirements in 40 CFR 60.374.
    (1) Existing sources are not required to conduct a performance test 
if a prior performance test was conducted using the same methods 
specified in 40 CFR 60.374 and either no process changes have been made 
since the test, or you can demonstrate that the results of the 
performance test, with or without adjustments, reliably demonstrate 
compliance with this subpart despite process changes.
    (2) Sources without a prior performance test, as described in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, must conduct a performance test using 
the methods specified in 40 CFR 60.374 by 180 days after the compliance 
date.

    (a) If you use a pressure treatment process with any wood 
preservative containing chromium, arsenic, dioxins, or methylene 
chloride at a new or existing area source, the preservative must be 
applied to the wood product inside a retort or similarly enclosed 
vessel.
    (b) If you use a thermal treatment process with any wood 
preservative containing chromium, arsenic, dioxins, or methylene 
chloride at a new or existing area source, the preservative must be 
applied using process treatment tanks equipped with an air scavenging 
system to control emissions.
    (c) If you use any wood preservative containing chromium, arsenic, 
dioxins, or methylene chloride at a new or existing area source, you 
must prepare and operate according to a management practice plan to 
minimize air emissions from the preservative treatment of wood at a new 
or existing area source. You may use your standard operating procedures 
to meet the requirements for a management practice plan if it includes 
the minimum activities required for a management practice plan. The 
management practice plan must include, but is not limited to, the 
following activities:
    (1) Minimize preservative usage;
    (2) Maintain records on the type of treatment process and types and 
amounts of wood preservatives used at the facility;
    (3) For the pressure treatment process, maintain charge records 
identifying pressure reading(s) inside the retorts (or similarly 
enclosed vessel);
    (4) For the thermal treatment process, maintain records that the air 
scavenging system is in place and operated properly during the treatment 
process;
    (5) Store treated wood product on drip pads or in a primary 
containment area to convey preservative drippage to a collection system 
until drippage has ceased;
    (6) For the pressure treatment process, fully drain the retort to 
the extent practicable, prior to opening the retort door;
    (7) Promptly collect any spills; and
    (8) Perform relevant corrective actions or preventative measures in 
the event of a malfunction before resuming operations.

relative PM loadings. The owner or operator shall continuously record 
the output from the bag leak detection system using electronic or other 
means (e.g., using a strip chart recorder or a data logger).
    (iii) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm 
system that will sound when the system detects an increase in relative 
particulate loading over the alarm set point established according to 
paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, and the alarm must be located such 
that it can be heard by the appropriate plant personnel.

[[Page 305]]

    (iv) In the initial adjustment of the bag leak detection system, you 
must establish, at a minimum, the baseline output by adjusting the 
sensitivity (range) and the averaging period of the device, the alarm 
set points, and the alarm delay time.
    (v) Following initial adjustment, you shall not adjust the averaging 
period, alarm set point, or alarm delay time without approval from the 
Administrator or delegated authority except as provided in paragraph 
(c)(1)(vi) of this section.
    (vi) Once per quarter, you may adjust the sensitivity of the bag 
leak detection system to account for seasonal effects, including 
temperature and humidity, according to the procedures identified in the 
site-specific monitoring plan required by paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section.
    (vii) You must install the bag leak detection sensor downstream of 
the fabric filter.
    (viii) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's 
instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
    (2) You must develop and submit to the Administrator or delegated 
authority for approval a site-specific monitoring plan for each bag leak 
detection system. You must operate and maintain the bag leak detection 
system according to the site-specific monitoring plan at all times. Each 
monitoring plan must describe the items in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through 
(vi) of this section.
    (i) Installation of the bag leak detection system;
    (ii) Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection 
system, including how the alarm set-point will be established;
    (iii) Operation of the bag leak detection system, including quality 
assurance procedures;
    (iv) How the bag leak detection system will be maintained, including 
a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list;
    (v) How the bag leak detection system output will be recorded and 
stored; and
    (vi) Corrective action procedures as specified in paragraph (c)(3) 
of this section. In approving the site-specific monitoring plan, the 
Administrator or delegated authority may allow owners and operators more 
than 3 hours to alleviate a specific condition that causes an alarm if 
the owner or operator identifies in the monitoring plan this specific 
condition as one that could lead to an alarm, adequately explains why it 
is not feasible to alleviate this condition within 3 hours of the time 
the alarm occurs, and demonstrates that the requested time will ensure 
alleviation of this condition as expeditiously as practicable.
    (3) For each bag leak detection system, you must initiate procedures 
to determine the cause of every alarm within 1 hour of the alarm. Except 
as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section, you must alleviate 
the cause of the alarm within 3 hours of the alarm by taking whatever 
corrective action(s) are necessary. Corrective actions may include, but 
are not limited to the following:
    (i) Inspecting the fabric filter for air leaks, torn or broken bags 
or filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in PM 
emissions;
    (ii) Sealing off defective bags or filter media;
    (iii) Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise 
repairing the control device;

                   Other Requirements and Information


<R05>
Sec. 63.11510  What General Provisions apply to this subpart?

    If you own or operate a new or existing affected source, you must 
comply with the requirements of the General Provisions (40 CFR part 63, 
subpart A) according to Table 1 of this subpart.

[[Page 318]]


<R05>
Sec. 63.11511  What definitions apply to this subpart?

    Terms used in this subpart are defined in this section.
    Batch electrolytic process tank means a tank used for an 
electrolytic process in which a part or group of parts, typically 
mounted on racks or placed in barrels, is placed in the tank and 
immersed in an electrolytic process solution as a single unit (i.e., as 
a batch) for a predetermined period of time, during which none of the 
parts are removed from the tank and no other parts are added to the 
tank, and after which the part or parts are removed from the tank as a 
unit.
    Bath means the liquid contents of a tank that is used for 
electroplating, electroforming, electropolishing, or other metal coating 
processes at a plating and polishing facility.
    Capture system means the collection of components used to capture 
gases and fumes released from one or more emissions points and then 
convey the captured gas stream to a control device, as part of a 
complete control system. A capture system may include, but is not 
limited to, the following components as applicable to a given capture 
system design: duct intake devices, hoods, enclosures, ductwork, 
dampers, manifolds, plenums, and fans.
    Cartridge filter means a type of control device that uses perforated 
metal cartridges containing a pleated paper or non-woven fibrous filter 
media to remove PM from a gas stream by sieving and other mechanisms. 
Cartridge filters can be designed with single use cartridges, which are 
removed and disposed after reaching capacity, or continuous use 
cartridges, which typically are cleaned by means of a pulse-jet 
mechanism.
    Composite mesh pad means a type of control device similar to a mesh 
pad mist eliminator except that the device is designed with multiple 
pads in series that are woven with layers of material with varying fiber 
diameters, which produce a coalescing effect on the droplets or PM that 
impinge upon the pads.
    Continuous electrolytic process tank means a tank that uses an 
electrolytic process and in which a continuous metal strip or other type 
of continuous substrate is fed into and removed from the tank 
continuously. This process is also called reel-to-reel electrolytic 
plating.
    Control device means equipment that is part of a control system that 
collects and/or reduces the quantity of a pollutant that is emitted to 
the air. The control device receives emissions that are transported from 
the process by the capture system.
    Control system means the combination of a capture system and a 
control device. The capture system is designed to collect and transport 
air emissions from the affected source to the control device. The 
overall control efficiency of any control system is a combination of the 
ability of the system to capture the air emissions (i.e., the capture 
efficiency) and the control device efficiency. Consequently, it is 
important to achieve good capture to ensure good overall control 
efficiency. Capture devices that are known to provide high capture 
efficiencies include hoods, enclosures, or any other duct intake devices 
with ductwork, dampers, manifolds, plenums, or fans.
    Cyanide plating means plating processes performed in tanks that use 
cyanide as a major bath ingredient and that operate at pH of 12 or more, 
and use or emit any of the plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined 
in this section. Electroplating and electroforming are performed with or 
without cyanide. The cyanide in the bath works to dissolve the HAP metal 
added as a cyanide compound (e.g., cadmium cyanide) and creates free 
cyanide in solution, which helps to corrode the anode. These tanks are 
self-regulating to a pH of 12 due to the caustic nature of the cyanide 
bath chemistry. The cyanide in the bath is a major bath constituent and 
not an additive; however, the self-regulating chemistry of the bath 
causes the bath to act as if wetting agents/fume suppressants are being 
used and to ensure an optimum plating process. All cyanide plating baths 
at pH greater than or equal to 12 have cyanide-metal complexes in 
solution. The metal HAP to be plated is not emitted because it is either 
bound in the metal-cyanide complex or reduced at the cathode to 
elemental metal, and

[[Page 319]]

plated onto the immersed parts. Cyanide baths are not intentionally 
operated at pH less 12 since unfavorable plating conditions would occur 
in the tank, among other negative effects.
    Deviation means any instance in which an affected source or an owner 
or operator of such an affected source:
    (1) Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this 
rule including, but not limited to, any equipment standard (including 
emissions and operating limits), management practice, or operation and 
maintenance requirement;
    (2) Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement 
an applicable requirement in this rule and that is included in the 
operating permit for any affected facility required to obtain such a 
permit; or
    (3) Fails to meet any equipment standard (including emission and 
operating limits), management standard, or operation and maintenance 
requirement in this rule during startup, shutdown, or malfunction.
    Dry mechanical polishing means a process used for removing defects 
from and smoothing the surface of finished metals and formed products 
after plating with any of the plating and polishing metal HAP, as 
defined in this section, using hard-faced abrasive wheels or belts and 
where no liquids or fluids are used to trap the removed metal particles.
    Electroforming means an electrolytic process using or emitting any 
of the plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined in this section, that 
is used for fabricating metal parts. This process is essentially the 
same as electroplating except that the plated substrate (mandrel) is 
removed, leaving only the metal plate. In electroforming, the metal 
plate is self-supporting and generally thicker than in electroplating.
    Electroless plating means a non-electrolytic process that uses or 
emits any of the plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined in this 
section, in which metallic ions in a plating bath or solution are 
reduced to form a metal coating at the surface of a catalytic substrate 
without the use of external electrical energy. Electroless plating is 
also called non-electrolytic plating. Examples include, but are not 
limited to, chromate conversion coating, nickel acetate sealing, sodium 
dichromate sealing, and manganese phosphate coating.
    Electrolytic plating processes means electroplating and 
electroforming that use or emit any of the plating and polishing metal 
HAP, as defined in this section, where metallic ions in a plating bath 
or solution are reduced to form a metal coating on the surface of parts 
and products using electrical energy.
    Electroplating means an electrolytic process that uses or emits any 
of the plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined in this section, in 
which metal ions in solution are reduced onto the surface of the work 
piece (the cathode) via an electrical current. The metal ions in the 
solution are usually replenished by the dissolution of metal from solid 
metal anodes fabricated of the same metal being plated, or by direct 
replenishment of the solution with metal salts or oxides; electroplating 
is also called electrolytic plating.
    Electropolishing means an electrolytic process that uses or emits 
any of the plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined in this section, 
in which a work piece is attached to an anode immersed in a bath, and 
the metal substrate is dissolved electrolytically, thereby removing the 
surface contaminant; electropolishing is also called electrolytic 
polishing.
    Fabric filter means a type of control device used for collecting PM 
by filtering a process exhaust stream through a filter or filter media. 
A fabric filter is also known as a baghouse.
    Flash electroplating means an electrolytic process that uses or 
emits any of the plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined in this 
section, and that is used no more than 3 cumulative minutes per hour or 
no more than 1 cumulative hour per day.
    General Provisions of this part (40 CFR part 63, subpart A) means 
the section of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) that addresses air 
pollution rules that apply to all HAP sources addressed in part 63, 
which includes the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air 
Pollutants (NESHAP).

[[Page 320]]

    HAP means hazardous air pollutant as defined from the list of 188 
chemicals and compounds specified in the CAA Amendments of 1990; HAP are 
also called ``air toxics.'' The five plating and polishing metal HAP, as 
defined in this section, are on this list of 188 chemicals.
    High efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter means a type of 
control device that uses a filter composed of a mat of randomly arranged 
fibers and is designed to remove at least 99.97 percent of airborne 
particles that are 0.3 micrometers or larger in diameter.
    Mesh pad mist eliminator means a type of control device, consisting 
of layers of interlocked filaments densely packed between two supporting 
grids that remove liquid droplets and PM from the gas stream through 
inertial impaction and direct interception.
    Metal coating operation means any process performed either in a tank 
that contains liquids or as part of a spraying operation that applies 
one or more plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined in this section, 
to parts and products used in manufacturing. These processes include but 
are not limited to: Non-chromium electroplating; electroforming;

emits any of the plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined in this 
section, performed without cyanide in the tank. These processes do not 
use cyanide in the tank and operate at pH values less than 12. These 
processes use electricity and add or remove metals such as metal HAP 
from parts and products used in manufacturing. Both electroplating and 
electroforming can be performed with cyanide as well.
    Non-electrolytic plating means a process that uses or emits any of 
the plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined in this section, in 
which metallic ions in a plating bath or solution are reduced to form a 
metal coating at the surface of a catalytic substrate without the use of 
external electrical energy. Non-electrolytic plating is also called 
electroless plating. Examples include chromate conversion coating, 
nickel acetate sealing, sodium dichromate sealing, and manganese 
phosphate coating.
    Packed-bed scrubber means a type of control device that includes a 
single or double packed bed that contains packing media on which PM and 
droplets impinge and are removed from the gas stream. The packed-bed 
section of the scrubber is followed by a mist eliminator to remove any 
water entrained from the packed-bed section.
    Plating and polishing facility means a facility engaged in one or 
more of the following processes that uses or emits any of the plating 
and polishing metal HAP, as defined in this section: Electroplating 
processes other than chromium electroplating (i.e., non-chromium 
electroplating); electroless plating; other non-electrolytic metal 
coating processes, such as chromate conversion coating, nickel acetate 
sealing, sodium dichromate sealing, and manganese phosphate coating; 
thermal spraying; and the dry mechanical polishing of finished metals 
and formed products after plating.
    Plating and polishing metal HAP means any compound of any of the 
following metals: cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, and nickel, or any 
of these metals in the elemental form, with the exception of lead. Any 
material that does not contain cadmium, chromium, lead, or nickel in 
amounts greater than or equal to 0.1 percent by weight, and does not 
contain manganese in amounts greater than or equal to 1.0 percent by 
weight, as reported on the Material Safety Data Sheet for the material, 
is not considered to be a plating and polishing metal HAP.
    Plating and polishing process tanks means any tank in which a 
process is performed at an affected plating and polishing facility that 
uses or has the potential to emit any of the plating and polishing metal

                Sec. Appendix A to Part 63--Test Methods

   Method 301--Field Validation of Pollutant Measurement Methods from 
                           Various Waste Media

                     1. Applicability and principle

    1.1 Applicability. This method, as specified in the applicable 
subpart, is to be used whenever a source owner or operator (hereafter 
referred to as an ``analyst'') proposes a test method to meet a U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirement in the absence of a 
validated method. This Method includes procedures for determining and 
documenting the quality, i.e., systematic error (bias) and random error 
(precision), of the measured concentrations from an effected source. 
This method is applicable to various waste media (i.e., exhaust gas, 
wastewater, sludge, etc.).
    1.1.1 If EPA currently recognizes an appropriate test method or 
considers the analyst's test method to be satisfactory for a particular 
source, the Administrator may waive the use of this protocol or may 
specify a less rigorous validation procedure. A list of validated 
methods may be obtained by contacting the Emission Measurement Technical 
Information Center (EMTIC), Mail Drop 19, U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, (919) 541-0200. Procedures for 
obtaining a waiver are in Section 12.0.
    1.1.2 This method includes optional procedures that may be used to 
expand the applicability of the proposed method. Section 7.0 involves 
ruggedness testing (Laboratory Evaluation), which demonstrates the 
sensitivity of the method to various parameters. Section 8.0 involves a 
procedure for including sample stability in bias and precision for 
assessing sample recovery and analysis times; Section 9.0 involves a 
procedure for the determination of the practical limit of quantitation 
for determining the lower limit of the method. These optional procedures 
are required for the waiver consideration outlined in Section 12.0.
    1.2 Principle. The purpose of these procedures is to determine bias 
and precision of a test method at the level of the applicable standard. 
The procedures involve (a) introducing known concentrations of an 
analyte or comparing the test method against a validated test method to 
determine the method's bias and (b) collecting multiple or collocated 
simultaneous samples to determine the method's precision.
    1.2.1 Bias. Bias is established by comparing the method's results 
against a reference value and may be eliminated by employing a 
correction factor established from the data obtained during the 
validation test. An offset bias may be handled accordingly. Methods that 
have bias correction factors outside 0.7 to 1.3 are unacceptable. 
Validated method to proposed method comparisons, section 6.2, requires a 
more restrictive test

[[Page 323]]

of central tendency and a lower correction factor allowance of 0.90 to 
1.10.
    1.2.2 Precision. At the minimum, paired sampling systems shall be 
used to establish precision. The precision of the method at the level of 
the standard shall not be greater than 50 percent relative standard 
deviation. For a validated method to proposed method equivalency 
comparisons, section 6.2, the analyst must demonstrate that the 
precision of the proposed test method is as precise as the validated 
method for acceptance.

                             2. Definitions

    2.1 Negative bias. Bias resulting when the measured result is less 
than the ``true'' value.
    2.2 Paired sampling system. A sampling system capable of obtaining 
two replicate samples that were collected as closely as possible in 
sampling time and sampling location.
    2.3 Positive bias. Bias resulting when the measured result is 
greater than the ``true'' value.
    2.4 Proposed method. The sampling and analytical methodology 
selected for field validation using the method described herein.
    2.5 Quadruplet sampling system. A sampling system capable of 
obtaining four replicate samples that were collected as closely as 
possible in sampling time and sampling location.
    2.6 Surrogate compound. A compound that serves as a model for the 
types of compounds being analyzed (i.e., similar chemical structure, 
properties, behavior). The model can be distinguished by the method from 
the compounds being analyzed.

                          3. Reference Material

    The reference materials shall be obtained or prepared at the level 
of the standard. Additional runs with higher and lower reference 
material concentrations may be made to expand the applicable range of 
the method, in accordance with the ruggedness test procedures.
    3.1 Exhaust Gas Tests. The analyst shall obtain a known 
concentration of the reference material (i.e., analyte of concern) from 
an independent source such as a specialty gas manufacturer, specialty 
chemical company, or commercial laboratory. A list of vendors may be 
obtained from EMTIC (see Section 1.1.1). The analyst should obtain the 
manufacturer's stability data of the analyte concentration and 
recommendations for recertification.
    3.2 Other Waste Media Tests. The analyst shall obtain pure liquid 
components of the reference materials (i.e., analytes of concern) from 
an independent manufacturer and dilute them in the same type matrix as 
the source waste. The pure reference materials shall be certified by the 
manufacturer as to purity and shelf life. The accuracy of all diluted 
reference material concentrations shall be verified by comparing their 
response to independently-prepared materials (independently prepared in 
this case means prepared from pure components by a different analyst).
    3.3 Surrogate Reference Materials. The analyst may use surrogate 
compounds, e.g., for highly toxic or reactive organic compounds, 
provided the analyst can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction 
that the surrogate compound behaves as the analyte. A surrogate may be 
an isotope or one that contains a unique element (e.g., chlorine) that 
is not present in the source or a derivation of the toxic or reactive 
compound, if the derivative formation is part of the method's procedure. 
Laboratory experiments or literature data may be used to show behavioral 
acceptability.
    3.4 Isotopically Labeled Materials. Isotope mixtures may contain the 
isotope and the natural analyte. For best results, the isotope labeled 
analyte concentration should be more than five times the natural 
concentration of the analyte.

                    4. EPA Performance Audit Material

    4.1 To assess the method bias independently, the analyst shall use 
(in addition to the reference material) an EPA performance audit 
material, if it is available. The analyst may contact EMTIC (see section 
1.1.1) to receive a list of currently available EPA audit materials. If 
the analyte is listed, the analyst should request the audit material at 
least 30 days before the validation test. If an EPA audit material is 
not available, request documentation from the validation report 
reviewing authority that the audit material is currently not available 
from EPA. Include this documentation with the field validation report.
    4.2 The analyst shall sample and analyze the performance audit 
sample three times according to the instructions provided with the audit 
sample. The analyst shall submit the three results with the field 
validation report. Although no acceptance criteria are set for these 
performance audit results, the analyst and reviewing authority may use 
them to assess the relative error of sample recovery, sample 
preparation, and analytical procedures and then consider the relative 
error in evaluating the measured emissions.

    5. Procedure for Determination of Bias and Precision in the Field

    The analyst shall select one of the sampling approaches below to 
determine the bias and precision of the data. After analyzing the 
samples, the analyst shall calculate the bias and precision according to 
the procedure described in section 6.0. When sampling a

[[Page 324]]

stationary source, follow the probe placement procedures in section 5.4.
    5.1 Isotopic Spiking. This approach shall be used only for methods 
that require mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Bias and precision are 
calculated by procedures described in section 6.1.
    5.1.1 Number of Samples and Sampling Runs. Collect a total of 12 
replicate samples by either obtaining six sets of paired samples or 
three sets of quadruplet samples.
    5.1.2 Spiking Procedure. Spike all 12 samples with the reference 
material at the level of the standard. Follow the appropriate spiking 
procedures listed below for the applicable waste medium.
    5.1.2.1 Exhaust Gas Testing. The spike shall be introduced as close 
to the tip of the sampling probe as possible.
    5.1.2.1.1 Gaseous Reference Material with Sorbent or Impinger 
Sampling Trains. Sample the reference material (in the laboratory or in 
the field) at a concentration which is close to the allowable 
concentration standard for the time required by the method, and then 
sample the gas stream for an equal amount of time. The time for sampling 
both the reference material and gas stream should be equal; however, the 
time should be adjusted to avoid sorbent breakthrough.
    5.1.2.1.2 Gaseous Reference Material with Sample Container (Bag or 
Canister). Spike the sample containers after completion of each test run 
with an amount equal to the allowable concentration standard of the 
emission point. The final concentration of the reference material shall 
approximate the level of the emission concentration in the stack. The 
volume amount of reference material shall be less than 10 percent of the 
sample volume.
    5.1.2.1.3 Liquid and Solid Reference Material with Sorbent or 
Impinger Trains. Spike the trains with an amount equal to the allowable 
concentration standard before sampling the stack gas. The spiking should 
be done in the field; however, it may be done in the laboratory.
    5.1.2.1.4 Liquid and Solid Reference Material with Sample Container 
(Bag or Canister). Spike the containers at the completion of each test 
run with an amount equal to the level of the emission standard.
    5.1.2.2 Other Waste Media. Spike the 12 replicate samples with the 
reference material either before or directly after sampling in the 
field.
    5.2 Comparison Against a Validated Test Method. Bias and precision 
are calculated using the procedures described in section 6.2. This 
approach shall be used when a validated method is available and an 
alternative method is being proposed.
    5.2.1 Number of Samples and Sampling Runs. Collect nine sets of 
replicate samples using a paired sampling system (a total of 18 samples) 
or four sets of replicate samples using a quadruplet sampling system (a 
total of 16 samples). In each sample set, the validated test method 
shall be used to collect and analyze half of the samples.
    5.2.2 Performance Audit Exception. Conduct the performance audit as 
required in section 4.0 for the validated test method. Conducting a 
performance audit on the test method being evaluated is recommended.
    5.3 Analyte Spiking. This approach shall be used when sections 5.1 
and 5.2 are not applicable. Bias and precision are calculated using the 
procedures described in Section 6.3.
    5.3.1 Number of Samples and Sampling Runs. Collect a total of 24 
samples using the quadruplet sampling system (a total of 6 sets of 
replicate samples).
    5.3.2 In each quadruplet set, spike half of the samples (two out of 
the four) with the reference material according to the applicable 
procedure in section 5.1.2.1 or 5.1.2.2.
    5.4 Probe Placement and Arrangement for Stationary Source Stack or 
Duct Sampling. The probes shall be placed in the same horizontal plane. 
For paired sample probes the arrangement should be that the probe tip is 
2.5 cm from the outside edge of the other with a pitot tube on the 
outside of each probe. Other paired arrangements for the pitot tube may 
be acceptable. For quadruplet sampling probes, the tips should be in a 
6.0 cm x 6.0 cm square area measured from the center line of the opening 
of the probe tip with a single pitot tube in the center or two pitot 
tubes with their location on either side of the probe tip configuration. 
An alternative arrangement should be proposed whenever the cross-
sectional area of the probe tip configuration is approximately 5 percent 
of the stack or duct cross-sectional area.

                             6. Calculations

    Data resulting from the procedures specified in section 5.0 shall be 
treated as follows to determine bias, correction factors, relative 
standard deviations, precision, and data acceptance.
    6.1 Isotopic Spiking. Analyze the data for isotopic spiking tests as 
outlined in sections 6.1.1 through 6.1.6.
    6.1.1 Calculate the numerical value of the bias using the results 
from the analysis of the isotopically spiked field samples and the 
calculated value of the isotopically labeled spike:

B=CS-S<INF>m</INF> Eq. 301=1

where:

B=Bias at the spike level.
S<INF>m</INF>=Mean of the measured values of the isotopically spiked 
samples.
CS=Calculated value of the isotopically labeled spike.
    6.1.2 Calculate the standard deviation of the S<INF>i</INF> values 
as follows:

[[Page 325]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.048


Eq. 301-2

where:

S <INF>i</INF>=Measured value of the isotopically labeled analyte in the 
ith field sample,
n=Number of isotopically spiked samples, 12.
    6.1.3. Calculate the standard deviation of the mean (SDM) as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.049


Eq. 301-3
    6.1.4 Test the bias for statistical significance by calculating the 
t-statistic,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.050

Eq. 301-4

and compare it with the critical value of the two-sided t-distribution 
at the 95-percent confidence level and n-1 degrees of freedom. This 
critical value is 2.201 for the eleven degrees of freedom when the 
procedure specified in section 5.1.2 is followed. If the calculated t-
value is greater than the critical value the bias is statistically 
significant and the analyst should proceed to evaluate the correction 
factor.
    6.1.5 Calculation of a Correction Factor. If the t-test does not 
show that the bias is statistically significant, use all analytical 
results without correction and proceed to the precision evaluation. If 
the method's bias is statistically significant, calculate the correction 
factor, CF, using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.051

Eq. 301-5
If the CF is outside the range of 0.70 to 1.30, the data and method are 
considered unacceptable. For correction factors within the range, 
multiply all analytical results by the CF to obtain the final values.
    6.1.6 Calculation of the Relative Standard Deviation (Precision). 
Calculate the relative standard deviation as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.052

Eq. 301-6
where S<INF>m</INF> is the measured mean of the isotopically labeled 
spiked samples.
    6.2 Comparison with Validated Method. Analyze the data for 
comparison with a validated method as outlined in sections 6.2.1 or 
6.2.2, as appropriate. Conduct these procedures in order to determine if 
a proposed method produces results equivalent to a validated method. 
Make all necessary bias corrections for the validated method, as 
appropriate. If the proposed method fails either test, the method 
results are unacceptable, and conclude that the proposed method is not 
as precise or accurate as the validated method. For highly variable 
sources, additional precision checks may be necessary. The analyst 
should consult with the Administrator if a highly variable source is 
suspected.
    6.2.1 Paired Sampling Systems.
    6.2.1.1. Precision. Determine the acceptance of the proposed 
method's variance with respect to the variability of the validated 
method results. If a significant difference is determined, the proposed 
method and the results are rejected. Proposed methods demonstrating F-
values equal to or less than the critical value have acceptable 
precision.
    6.2.1.2 Calculate the variance of the proposed method, 
S<INF>p</INF>2, and the variance of the validated method, 
S<INF>v</INF>2, using the following equation:

S<INF>(porv)</INF>2=SD\2\ Eq. 301-7

where:

SD<INF>v</INF>=Standard deviation provided with the validated method,
SD<INF>p</INF>=Standard deviation of the proposed method calculated 
using Equation 301-9a.

    6.2.1.3 The F-test. Determine if the variance of the proposed method 
is significantly different from that of the validated method by 
calculating the F-value using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.053

Eq. 301-8
    Compare the experimental F value with the critical value of F. The 
critical value is 1.0 when the procedure specified in section 5.2.1 for 
paired trains is followed. If the calculated F is greater than the 
critical value, the difference in precision is significant and the data 
and proposed method are unacceptable.
    6.2.1.4 Bias Analysis. Test the bias for statistical significance by 
calculating the t-statistic and determine if the mean of the differences 
between the proposed method and the validated method is significant at 
the 80-percent confidence level. This procedure requires the standard 
deviation of the validated method, SD<INF>v</INF>, to be known. Employ 
the value furnished with the method. If the

[[Page 326]]

standard deviation of the validated method is not available, the paired 
replicate sampling procedure may not be used. Determine the mean of the 
paired sample differences, d<INF>m</INF>, and the standard deviation, 
SD<INF>d</INF>, of the differences, d<INF>1</INF>'s, using Equation 301-
2 where: d<INF>i</INF> replaces S<INF>i</INF>, d<INF>m</INF> replaces 
S<INF>m</INF>. Calculate the standard deviation of the proposed method, 
SD<INF>p</INF>, as follows:

SD<INF>p</INF>=SD<INF>d</INF>-SD<INF>v</INF> Eq. 301-9a

(If SD<INF>v</INF><ls-thn-eq>SD<INF>d</INF>, let SD=SD<INF>d</INF>/
1.414).

    Calculate the value of the t-statistic using the following equation:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.054
    
Eq. 301-9

where n is the total number of paired samples. For the procedure in 
section 5.2.1, n equals nine. Compare the calculated t-statistic with 
the corresponding value from the table of the t-statistic. When nine 
runs are conducted, as specified in section 5.2.1, the critical value of 
the t-statistic is 1.397 for eight degrees of freedom. If the calculated 
t-value is greater than the critical value the bias is statistically 
significant and the analyst should proceed to evaluate the correction 
factor.
    6.2.1.5 Calculation of a Correction Factor. If the statistical test 
cited above does not show a significant bias with respect to the 
reference method, assume that the proposed method is unbiased and use 
all analytical results without correction. If the method's bias is 
statistically significant, calculate the correction factor, CF, as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.055

Eq. 301-10

where V<INF>m</INF> is the mean of the validated method's values.
    Multiply all analytical results by CF to obtain the final values. 
The method results, and the method, are unacceptable if the correction 
factor is outside the range of 0.9 to 1.10.
    6.2.2 Quadruplet Replicate Sampling Systems.
    6.2.2.1 Precision. Determine the acceptance of the proposed method's 
variance with respect to the variability of the validated method 
results. If a significant difference is determined the proposed method 
and the results are rejected.
    6.2.2.2 Calculate the variance of the proposed method, 
S<INF>p</INF>\2\, using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.056

Eq. 301-11

where the d<INF>i</INF>'s are the differences between the validated 
method values and the proposed method values.

    6.2.2.3 The F-test. Determine if the variance of the proposed method 
is more variable than that of the validated method by calculating the F-
value using Equation 301-8. Compare the experimental F value with the 
critical value of F. The critical value is 1.0 when the procedure 
specified in section 5.2.2 for quadruplet trains is followed. The 
calculated F should be less than or equal to the critical value. If the 
difference in precision is significant the results and the proposed 
method are unacceptable.
    6.2.2.4 Bias Analysis. Test the bias for statistical significance at 
the 80 percent confidence level by calculating the t-statistic. 
Determine the bias (mean of the differences between the proposed method 
and the validated method, d<INF>m</INF>) and the standard deviation, 
SD<INF>d</INF>, of the differences. Calculate the standard deviation of 
the differences, SD<INF>d</INF>, using Equation 301-2 and substituting 
d<INF>i</INF> for S<INF>i</INF>. The following equation is used to 
calculate d<INF>i</INF>:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.057

Eq. 301-12

and: V<INF>1i</INF>=First measured value of the validated method in the 
ith test sample.
P<INF>1i</INF>=First measured value of the proposed method in the ith 
test sample.

    Calculate the t-statistic using Equation 301-9 where n is the total 
number of test sample differences (d<INF>i</INF>). For the procedure in 
section 5.2.2, n equals four. Compare the calculated t-statistic with 
the corresponding value from the table of the t-statistic and determine 
if the mean is significant at the 80-percent confidence level. When four 
runs are conducted, as specified in section 5.2.2, the critical value of 
the t-statistic is 1.638 for three degrees of freedom. If the calculated 
t-value is greater than the critical value the bias is statistically 
significant and the analyst should proceed to evaluate the correction 
factor.
    6.2.2.5 Correction Factor Calculation. If the method's bias is 
statistically significant, calculate the correction factor, CF, using 
Equation 301-10. Multiply all analytical results by CF to obtain the 
final values. The method results, and the method, are unacceptable if 
the correction factor is outside the range of 0.9 to 1.10.

[[Page 327]]

    6.3 Analyte Spiking. Analyze the data for analyte spike testing as 
outlined in Sections 6.3.1 through 6.3.3.
    6.3.1 Precision.
    6.3.1.1 Spiked Samples. Calculate the difference, d<INF>i</INF>, 
between the pairs of the spiked proposed method measurements for each 
replicate sample set. Determine the standard deviation (SD<INF>s</INF>) 
of the spiked values using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.058

Eq. 301-13

where: n = Number of runs.
    Calculate the relative standard deviation of the proposed spiked 
method using Equation 301-6 where S<INF>m</INF> is the measured mean of 
the analyte spiked samples. The proposed method is unacceptable if the 
RSD is greater than 50 percent.
    6.3.1.2 Unspiked Samples. Calculate the standard deviation of the 
unspiked values using Equation 301-13 and the relative standard 
deviation of the proposed unspiked method using Equation 301-6 where 
S<INF>m</INF> is the measured mean of the analyte spiked samples. The 
RSD must be less than 50 percent.
    6.3.2 Bias. Calculate the numerical value of the bias using the 
results from the analysis of the spiked field samples, the unspiked 
field samples, and the calculated value of the spike:

B=S<INF>m</INF>-M<INF>m</INF>-CS
Eq. 301-14

where: B = Bias at the spike level.
S<INF>m</INF> = Mean of the spiked samples.
M<INF>m</INF> = Mean of the unspiked samples.
CS = Calculated value of the spiked level.
    6.3.2.1 Calculate the standard deviation of the mean using the 
following equation where SD<INF>s</INF> and SD<INF>u</INF> are the 
standard deviations of the spiked and unspiked sample values 
respectively as calculated using Equation 301-13.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.059

Eq. 301-15

    6.3.2.2 Test the bias for statistical significance by calculating 
the t-statistic using Equation 301-4 and comparing it with the critical 
value of the two-sided t-distribution at the 95-percent confidence level 
and n-1 degrees of freedom. This critical value is 2.201 for the eleven 
degrees of freedom.
    6.3.3 Calculation of a Correction Factor. If the t-test shows that 
the bias is not statistically significant, use all analytical results 
without correction. If the method's bias is statistically significant, 
calculate the correction factor using Equation 301-5. Multiply all 
analytical results by CF to obtain the final values.

                    7. Ruggedness Testing (Optional)

    7.1 Laboratory Evaluation.
    7.1.1 Ruggedness testing is a useful and cost-effective laboratory 
study to determine the sensitivity of a method to certain parameters 
such as sample collection rate, interferant concentration, collecting 
medium temperature, or sample recovery temperature. This Section 
generally discusses the principle of the ruggedness test. A more 
detailed description is presented in citation 10 of Section 13.0.
    7.1.2 In a ruggedness test, several variables are changed 
simultaneously rather than one variable at a time. This reduces the 
number of experiments required to evaluate the effect of a variable. For 
example, the effect of seven variables can be determined in eight 
experiments rather than 128 (W.J. Youden, Statistical Manual of the 
Association of Official Analytical Chemists, Association of Official 
Analytical Chemists, Washington, DC, 1975, pp. 33-36).
    7.1.3 Data from ruggedness tests are helpful in extending the 
applicability of a test method to different source concentrations or 
source categories.

   8. Procedure for Including Sample Stability in Bias and Precision 
                               Evaluations

    8.1 Sample Stability.
    8.1.1 The test method being evaluated must include procedures for 
sample storage and the time within which the collected samples shall be 
analyzed.
    8.1.2 This section identifies the procedures for including the 
effect of storage time in bias and precision evaluations. The evaluation 
may be deleted if the test method specifies a time for sample storage.
    8.2 Stability Test Design. The following procedures shall be 
conducted to identify the effect of storage times on analyte samples. 
Store the samples according to the procedure specified in the test 
method. When using the analyte spiking procedures (section 5.3), the 
study should include equal numbers of spiked and unspiked samples.
    8.2.1 Stack Emission Testing.
    8.2.1.1 For sample container (bag or canister) and impinger sampling 
systems, sections 5.1 and 5.3, analyze six of the samples at the minimum 
storage time. Then analyze the same six samples at the maximum storage 
time.
    8.2.1.2 For sorbent and impinger sampling systems, sections 5.1 and 
5.3, that require extraction or digestion, extract or digest six of the 
samples at the minimum storage time and extract or digest six other 
samples at the maximum storage time. Analyze an aliquot of the first six 
extracts (digestates) at both the minimum and maximum storage

[[Page 328]]

times. This will provide some freedom to analyze extract storage 
impacts.
    8.2.1.3 For sorbent sampling systems, sections 5.1 and 5.3, that 
require thermal desorption, analyze six samples at the minimum storage 
time. Analyze another set of six samples at the maximum storage time.
    8.2.1.4 For systems set up in accordance with section 5.2, the 
number of samples analyzed at the minimum and maximum storage times 
shall be half those collected (8 or 9). The procedures for samples 
requiring extraction or digestion should parallel those in section 
8.2.1.
    8.2.2 Other Waste Media Testing. Analyze half of the replicate 
samples at the minimum storage time and the other half at the maximum 
storage time in order to identify the effect of storage times on analyte 
samples.

   9. Procedure for Determination of Practical Limit of Quantitation 
                               (Optional)

    9.1 Practical Limit of Quantitation.
    9.1.1 The practical limit of quantitation (PLQ) is the lowest level 
above which quantitative results may be obtained with an acceptable 
degree of confidence. For this protocol, the PLQ is defined as 10 times 
the standard deviation, s<INF>o</INF>, at the blank level. This PLQ 
corresponds to an uncertainty of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>30 percent at the 
99-percent confidence level.
    9.1.2 The PLQ will be used to establish the lower limit of the test 
method.
    9.2 Procedure I for Estimating s<INF>o</INF>. This procedure is 
acceptable if the estimated PLQ is no more than twice the calculated 
PLQ. If the PLQ is greater than twice the calculated PLQ use Procedure 
II.
    9.2.1 Estimate the PLQ and prepare a test standard at this level. 
The test standard could consist of a dilution of the reference material 
described in section 3.0.
    9.2.2 Using the normal sampling and analytical procedures for the 
method, sample and analyze this standard at least seven times in the 
laboratory.
    9.2.3 Calculate the standard deviation, s<INF>o</INF>, of the 
measured values.
    9.2.4 Calculate the PLQ as 10 times s<INF>o</INF>.
    9.3 Procedure II for Estimating s<INF>o</INF>. This procedure is to 
be used if the estimated PLQ is more than twice the calculated PLQ.
    9.3.1 Prepare two additional standards at concentration levels lower 
than the standard used in Procedure I.
    9.3.2 Sample and analyze each of these standards at least seven 
times.
    9.3.3 Calculate the standard deviation for each concentration level.
    9.3.4 Plot the standard deviations of the three test standards as a 
function of the standard concentrations.
    9.3.5 Draw a best-fit straight line through the data points and 
extrapolate to zero concentration. The standard deviation at zero 
concentration is S<INF>0</INF>.
    9.3.6 Calculate the PLQ as 10 times S<INF>0</INF>.

                10.0 Field Validation Report Requirements

    The field validation report shall include a discussion of the 
regulatory objectives for the testing which describe the reasons for the 
test, applicable emission limits, and a description of the source. In 
addition, validation results shall include:
    10.1 Summary of the results and calculations shown in section 6.0.
    10.2 Reference material certification and value(s).
    10.3 Performance audit results or letter from the reviewing 
authority stating the audit material is currently not available.
    10.4 Laboratory demonstration of the quality of the spiking system.
    10.5 Discussion of laboratory evaluations.
    10.6 Discussion of field sampling.
    10.7 Discussion of sample preparations and analysis.
    10.8 Storage times of samples (and extracts, if applicable).
    10.9 Reasons for eliminating any results.

                          11. Followup Testing

    The correction factor calculated in section 6.0 shall be used to 
adjust the sample concentrations in all followup tests conducted at the 
same source. These tests shall consist of at least three replicate 
samples, and the average shall be used to determine the pollutant 
concentration. The number of samples to be collected and analyzed shall 
be as follows, depending on the validated method precision level:
    11.1 Validated relative standard deviation (RSD) <= <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>15 Percent. Three replicate samples.
    11.2 Validated RSD <= <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>30 Percent. Six 
replicate samples.
    11.3 Validated RSD <= <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>50 Percent. Nine 
replicate samples.
    11.4 Equivalent method. Three replicate samples.

                  12. Procedure for Obtaining a Waiver

    12.1 Waivers. These procedures may be waived or a less rigorous 
protocol may be granted for site-specific applications. The following 
are three example situations for which a waiver may be considered.
    12.1.1 ``Similar'' Sources. If the test method has been validated 
previously at a ``similar'' source, the procedures may be waived 
provided the requester can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator that the sources are ``similar.'' The methods's 
applicability to the ``similar'' source may be demonstrated by 
conducting a ruggedness test as described in section 6.0.

[[Page 329]]

    12.1.2 ``Documented'' Methods. In some cases, bias and precision may 
have been documented through laboratory tests or protocols different 
from this method. If the analyst can demonstrate to the satisfaction of 
the Administrator that the bias and precision apply to a particular 
application, the Administrator may waive these procedures or parts of 
the procedures.
    12.1.3 ``Conditional'' Test Methods. When the method has been 
demonstrated to be valid at several sources, the analyst may seek a 
``conditional'' method designation from the Administrator. 
``Conditional'' method status provides an automatic waiver from the 
procedures provided the test method is used within the stated 
applicability.
    12.2 Application for Waiver. In general, the requester shall provide 
a thorough description of the test method, the intended application, and 
results of any validation or other supporting documents. Because of the 
many potential situations in which the Administrator may grant a waiver, 
it is neither possible nor desirable to prescribe the exact criteria for 
a waiver. At a minimum, the requester is responsible for providing the 
following.
    12.2.1 A clearly written test method, preferably in the format of 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A Test Methods. The method must include an 
applicability statement, concentration range, precision, bias 
(accuracy), and time in which samples must be analyzed.
    12.2.2.2 Summaries (see section 10.0) of previous validation tests 
or other supporting documents. If a different procedure from that 
described in this method was used, the requester shall provide 
appropriate documents substantiating (to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator) the bias and precision values.
    12.2.2.3 Results of testing conducted with respect to sections 7.0, 
8.0, and 9.0.
    12.2.3 Discussion of the applicability statement and arguments for 
approval of the waiver. This discussion should address as applicable the 
following: Applicable regulation, emission standards, effluent 
characteristics, and process operations.
    12.3 Requests for Waiver. Each request shall be in writing and 
signed by the analyst. Submit requests to the Director, OAQPS, Technical 
Support Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research 
Triangle Park, NC 27711.

Method 303--Determination of Visible Emissions From By-Product Coke Oven 
                                Batteries

    Note: This method is not inclusive with respect to observer 
certification. Some material is incorporated by reference from other 
methods in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.

[[Page 330]]

Therefore, to obtain reliable results, persons using this method should 
have a thorough knowledge of Method 9.

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination 
of visible emissions (VE) from the following by-product coke oven 
battery sources: charging systems during charging; doors, topside port 
lids, and offtake systems on operating coke ovens; and collecting mains. 
This method is also applicable for qualifying observers for visually 
determining the presence of VE.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 A certified observer visually determines the VE from coke oven 
battery sources. Certification procedures are presented. This method 
does not require that opacity of emissions be determined or that 
magnitude be differentiated.

                             3.0 Definitions

    3.1 Bench means the platform structure in front of the oven doors.
    3.2 By-product Coke Oven Battery means a source consisting of a 
group of ovens connected by common walls, where coal undergoes 
destructive distillation under positive pressure to produce coke and 
coke oven gas, from which by-products are recovered.
    3.3 Charge or charging period means the period of time that 
commences when coal begins to flow into an oven through a topside port 
and ends when the last charging port is recapped.
    3.4 Charging system means an apparatus used to charge coal to a coke 
oven (e.g., a larry car for wet coal charging systems).
    3.5 Coke oven door means each end enclosure on the push side and the 
coking side of an oven. The chuck, or leveler-bar, door is considered 
part of the push side door. The coke oven door area includes the entire 
area on the vertical face of a coke oven between the bench and the top 
of the battery between two adjacent buck stays.
    3.6 Coke side means the side of a battery from which the coke is 
discharged from ovens at the end of the coking cycle.
    3.7 Collecting main means any apparatus that is connected to one or 
more offtake systems and that provides a passage for conveying gases 
under positive pressure from the by-product coke oven battery to the by-
product recovery system.
    3.8 Consecutive charges means charges observed successively, 
excluding any charge during which the observer's view of the charging 
system or topside ports is obscured.
    3.9 Damper-off means to close off the gas passage between the coke 
oven and the collecting main, with no flow of raw coke oven gas from the 
collecting main into the oven or into the oven's offtake system(s).
    3.10 Decarbonization period means the period of time for combusting 
oven carbon that commences when the oven lids are removed from an empty 
oven or when standpipe caps of an oven are opened. The period ends with 
the initiation of the next charging period for that oven.
    3.11 Larry car means an apparatus used to charge coal to a coke oven 
with a wet coal charging system.
    3.12 Log average means logarithmic average as calculated in Section 
12.4.

stationary and provides a passage for gases from an oven to a coke oven 
battery collecting main or to another oven. Offtake system components 
include the standpipe and standpipe caps, goosenecks, stationary jumper 
pipes, mini-standpipes, and standpipe and gooseneck connections.
    3.14 Operating oven means any oven not out of operation for rebuild 
or maintenance work extensive enough to require the oven to be skipped 
in the charging sequence.
    3.15 Oven means a chamber in the coke oven battery in which coal 
undergoes destructive distillation to produce coke.
    3.16 Push side means the side of the battery from which the coke is

(except for corrective lenses) eye, excluding steam or condensing water.

                      4.0 Interferences [Reserved]

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, 
operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all

[[Page 331]]

of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility 
of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and 
health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory 
limitations prior to performing this test method.
    5.2 Safety Training. Because coke oven batteries have hazardous 
environments, the training materials and the field training (Section 
10.0) shall cover the precautions required by the company to address 
health and safety hazards. Special emphasis shall be given to the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations 
pertaining to exposure of coke oven workers (see Reference 3 in Section 
16.0). In general, the regulation requires that special fire-retardant 
clothing and respirators be worn in certain restricted areas of the coke 
oven battery. The OSHA regulation also prohibits certain activities, 
such as chewing gum, smoking, and eating in these areas.

                  6.0 Equipment and Supplies [Reserved]

                  7.0 Reagents and Standards [Reserved]

 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage [Reserved]

                     9.0 Quality Control [Reserved]

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    Observer certification and training requirements are as follows:
    10.1 Certification Procedures. This method requires only the 
determination of whether VE occur and does not require the determination 
of opacity levels; therefore, observer certification according to Method 
9 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter is not required to obtain 
certification under this method. However, in order to receive Method 303 
observer certification, the first-time observer (trainee) shall have 
attended the lecture portion of the Method 9 certification course. In 
addition, the trainee shall successfully complete the Method 303 
training course, satisfy the field observation requirement, and 
demonstrate adequate performance and sufficient knowledge of Method 303. 
The Method 303 training course shall be conducted by or under the 
sanction of the EPA and shall consist of classroom instruction and field 
observations, and a proficiency test.
    10.1.1 The classroom instruction shall familiarize the trainees with 
Method 303 through lecture, written training materials, and a Method 303 
demonstration video. A successful completion of the classroom portion of 
the Method 303 training course shall be demonstrated by a perfect score 
on a written test. If the trainee fails to answer all of the questions 
correctly, the trainee may review the appropriate portion of the 
training materials and retake the test.
    10.1.2 The field observations shall be a minimum of 12 hours and 
shall be completed before attending the Method 303 certification course. 
Trainees shall observe the operation of a coke oven battery as it 
pertains to Method 303, including topside operations, and shall also 
practice conducting Method 303 or similar methods. During the field 
observations, trainees unfamiliar with coke battery operations shall 
receive instruction from an experienced coke oven observer familiar with 
Method 303 or similar methods and with the operation of coke batteries. 
The trainee must verify completion of at least 12 hours of field 
observation prior to attending the Method 303 certification course.
    10.1.3 All trainees must demonstrate proficiency in the application 
of Method 303 to a panel of three certified Method 303 observers, 
including an ability to differentiate coke oven emissions from 
condensing water vapor and smoldering coal. Each panel member shall have 
at least 120 days experience in reading visible emissions from coke 
ovens. The visible emissions inspections that will satisfy the 
experience requirement must be inspections of coke oven battery fugitive 
emissions from the emission points subject to emission standards under 
subpart L of this part (i.e., coke oven doors, topside port lids, 
offtake system(s), and charging operations), using either Method 303 or 
predecessor State or local test methods. A ``day's experience'' for a 
particular inspection is a day on which one complete inspection was 
performed for that emission point under Method 303 or a predecessor 
State or local method. A ``day's experience'' does not mean 8 or 10 
hours performing inspections, or any particular time expressed in 
minutes or hours that may have been spent performing them. Thus, it 
would be possible for an individual to qualify as a Method 303 panel 
member for some emission points, but not others (e.g., an individual 
might satisfy the experience requirement for coke oven doors, but not 
topside port lids). Until November 15, 1994, the EPA may waive the 
certification requirement (but not the experience requirement) for panel 
members. The composition of the panel shall be approved by the EPA. The 
panel shall observe the trainee in a series of training runs and a 
series of certification runs. There shall be a minimum of 1 training run 
for doors, topside port lids, and offtake systems, and a minimum of 5 
training runs (i.e., 5 charges) for charging. During training runs, the 
panel can advise the trainee on proper procedures. There shall be a 
minimum of 3 certification runs for doors, topside port lids, and 
offtake systems, and a minimum of 15 certification runs for charging 
(i.e., 15 charges). The certifications runs shall be unassisted. 
Following the certification test runs, the panel shall approve or 
disapprove certification based on the trainee's performance during the 
certification

[[Page 332]]

runs. To obtain certification, the trainee shall demonstrate to the 
satisfaction of the panel a high degree of proficiency in performing 
Method 303. To aid in evaluating the trainee's performance, a checklist, 
provided by the EPA, will be used by the panel members.
    10.2 Observer Certification/Recertification. The coke oven observer 
certification is valid for 1 year from date of issue. The observer shall 
recertify annually by viewing the training video and answering all of 
the questions on the certification test correctly. Every 3 years, an 
observer shall be required to pass the proficiency test in Section 
10.1.3 in order to be certified.
    10.3 The EPA (or applicable enforcement agency) shall maintain 
records reflecting a certified observer's successful completion of the 
proficiency test, which shall include the completed proficiency test 
checklists for the certification runs.
    10.4 An owner or operator of a coke oven battery subject to subpart 
L of this part may observe a training and certification program under 
this section.

                             11.0 Procedure

    11.1 Procedure for Determining VE from Charging Systems During 
Charging.
    11.1.1 Number of Oven Charges. Refer to Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of this 
part for the number of oven charges to observe. The observer shall 
observe consecutive charges. Charges that are nonconsecutive can only be 
observed when necessary to replace observations terminated prior to the 
completion of a charge because of visual interferences. (See Section 
11.1.5).
    11.1.2 Data Records. Record all the information requested at the top 
of the charging system inspection sheet (Figure 303-1). For each charge, 
record the identification number of the oven being charged, the 
approximate beginning time of the charge, and the identification of the 
larry car used for the charge.
    11.1.3 Observer Position. Stand in an area or move to positions on 
the topside of the coke oven battery with an unobstructed view of the 
entire charging system. For wet coal charging systems or non-pipeline 
coal charging systems, the observer should have an unobstructed view of 
the emission points of the charging system, including larry car hoppers, 
drop sleeves, and the topside ports of the oven being charged. Some 
charging systems are configured so that all emission points can only be 
seen from a distance of five ovens. For other batteries, distances of 8 
to 12 ovens are adequate.
    11.1.4 Observation. The charging period begins when coal begins to 
flow into the oven and ends when the last charging port is recapped. 
During the charging period, observe all of the potential sources of VE 
from the entire charging system. For wet coal charging systems or non-
pipeline coal charging systems, sources of VE typically include the 
larry car hoppers, drop sleeves, slide gates, and topside ports on the 
oven being charged. Any VE from an open standpipe cap on the oven being 
charged is included as charging VE.
    11.1.4.1 Using an accumulative-type stopwatch with unit divisions of 
at least 0.5 seconds, determine the total time VE are observed as 
follows. Upon observing any VE emerging from any part of the charging 
system, start the stopwatch. Stop the watch when VE are no longer 
observed emerging, and restart the watch when VE reemerges.
    11.1.4.2 When VE occur simultaneously from several points during a 
charge, consider the sources as one. Time overlapping VE as continuous 
VE. Time single puffs of VE only for the time it takes for the puff to 
emerge from the charging system. Continue to time VE in this manner for 
the entire charging period. Record the accumulated time to the nearest 
0.5 second under ``Visible emissions, seconds'' on Figure 303-1.
    11.1.5 Visual Interference. If fugitive VE from other sources at the 
coke oven battery site (e.g., door leaks or condensing water vapor from 
the coke oven wharf) prevent a clear view of the charging system during 
a charge, stop the stopwatch and make an appropriate notation under 
``Comments'' on Figure 303-1. Label the observation an observation of an 
incomplete charge, and observe another charge to fulfill the 
requirements of Section 11.1.1.
    11.1.6 VE Exemptions. Do not time the following VE:
    11.1.6.1 The VE from burning or smoldering coal spilled on top of 
the oven, topside port lid, or larry car surfaces;
    Note: The VE from smoldering coal are generally white or gray. These 
VE generally have a plume of less than 1 meter long. If the observer 
cannot safely and with reasonable confidence determine that VE are from 
charging, do not count them as charging emissions.
    11.1.6.2 The VE from the coke oven doors or from the leveler bar; or
    11.1.6.3 The VE that drift from the top of a larry car hopper if the 
emissions had already been timed as VE from the drop sleeve.
    Note: When the slide gate on a larry car hopper closes after the 
coal has been added to the oven, the seal may not be airtight. On 
occasions, a puff of smoke observed at the drop sleeves is forced past 
the slide gate up into the larry car hopper and may drift from the top; 
time these VE either at the drop sleeves or the hopper. If the larry car 
hopper does not have a slide gate or the slide gate is left open or 
partially closed, VE may quickly pass through the larry car hopper 
without being observed at the drop sleeves and will appear as a strong 
surge of smoke; time these as charging VE.

[[Page 333]]

    11.1.7 Total Time Record. Record the total time that VE were 
observed for each charging operation in the appropriate column on the 
charging system inspection sheet.
    11.1.8 Determination of Validity of a Set of Observations. Five 
charging observations (runs) obtained in accordance with this method 
shall be considered a valid set of observations for that day. No 
observation of an incomplete charge shall be included in a daily set of 
observations that is lower than the lowest reading for a complete 
charge. If both complete and incomplete charges have been observed, the 
daily set of observations shall include the five highest values 
observed. Four or three charging observations (runs) obtained in 
accordance with this method shall be considered a valid set of charging 
observations only where it is not possible to obtain five charging 
observations, because visual interferences (see Section 11.1.5) or 
inclement weather prevent a clear view of the charging system during 
charging. However, observations from three or four charges that satisfy 
these requirements shall not be considered a valid set of charging 
observations if use of such set of observations in a calculation under 
Section 12.4 would cause the value of A to be less than 145.
    11.1.9 Log Average. For each day on which a valid daily set of 
observations is obtained, calculate the daily 30-day rolling log average 
of seconds of visible emissions from the charging operation for each 
battery using these data and the 29 previous valid daily sets of 
observations, in accordance with Section 12.4.
    11.2. Procedure for Determining VE from Coke Oven Door Areas. The 
intent of this procedure is to determine VE from coke oven door areas by 
carefully observing the door area from a standard distance while walking 
at a normal pace.
    11.2.1 Number of Runs. Refer to Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of this part for 
the appropriate number of runs.
    11.2.2 Battery Traverse. To conduct a battery traverse, walk the 
length of the battery on the outside of the pusher machine and quench 
car tracks at a steady, normal walking pace, pausing to make appropriate 
entries on the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303-2). A single test 
run consists of two timed traverses, one for the coke side and one for 
the push side. The walking pace shall be such that the duration of the 
traverse does not exceed an average of 4 seconds per oven door, 
excluding time spent moving around stationary obstructions or waiting 
for other obstructions to move from positions blocking the view of a 
series of doors. Extra time is allowed for each leak (a maximum of 10 
additional seconds for each leaking door) for the observer to make the 
proper notation. A walking pace of 3 seconds per oven door has been 
found to be typical. Record the actual traverse time with a stopwatch.
    11.2.2.1 Include in the traverse time only the time spent observing 
the doors and recording door leaks. To measure actual traverse time, use 
an accumulative-type stopwatch with unit divisions of 0.5 seconds or 
less. Exclude interruptions to the traverse and time required for the 
observer to move to positions where the view of the battery is 
unobstructed, or for obstructions, such as the door machine, to move 
from positions blocking the view of a series of doors.
    11.2.2.2 Various situations may arise that will prevent the observer 
from viewing a door or a series of doors. Prior to the door inspection, 
the owner or operator may elect to temporarily suspend charging 
operations for the duration of the inspection, so that all of the doors 
can be viewed by the observer. The observer has two options for dealing 
with obstructions to view: (a) Stop the stopwatch and wait for the 
equipment to move or the fugitive emissions to dissipate before 
completing the traverse; or (b) stop the stopwatch, skip the affected 
ovens, and move to an unobstructed position to continue the traverse. 
Restart the stopwatch and continue the traverse. After the completion of 
the traverse, if the equipment has moved or the fugitive emissions have 
dissipated, inspect the affected doors. If the equipment is still 
preventing the observer from viewing the doors, then the affected doors 
may be counted as not observed. If option (b) is used because of doors 
blocked by machines during charging operations, then, of the affected 
doors, exclude the door from the most recently charged oven from the 
inspection. Record the oven numbers and make an appropriate notation 
under ``Comments'' on the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303-2).
    11.2.2.3 When batteries have sheds to control emissions, conduct the 
inspection from outside the shed unless the doors cannot be adequately 
viewed. In this case, conduct the inspection from the bench. Be aware of 
special safety considerations pertinent to walking on the bench and 
follow the instructions of company personnel on the required equipment 
and procedures. If possible, conduct the bench traverse whenever the 
bench is clear of the door machine and hot coke guide.
    11.2.3 Observations. Record all the information requested at the top 
of the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303-2), including the number 
of non-operating ovens. Record the clock time at the start of the 
traverse on each side of the battery. Record which side is being 
inspected (i.e., coke side or push side). Other information may be 
recorded at the discretion of the observer, such as the location of the 
leak (e.g., top of the door, chuck door, etc.), the reason for any 
interruption of the traverse, or the position of the sun relative to the 
battery and sky conditions (e.g., overcast, partly sunny, etc.).

[[Page 334]]

    11.2.3.1 Begin the test run by starting the stopwatch and traversing 
either the coke side or the push side of the battery. After completing 
one side, stop the watch. Complete this procedure on the other side. If 
inspecting more than one battery, the observer may view the push sides 
and the coke sides sequentially.
    11.2.3.2 During the traverse, look around the entire perimeter of 
each oven door. The door is considered leaking if VE are detected in the 
coke oven door area. The coke oven door area includes the entire area on 
the vertical face of a coke oven between the bench and the top of the 
battery between two adjacent buck stays (e.g., the oven door, chuck 
door, between the masonry brick, buck stay or jamb, or other sources). 
Record the oven number and make the appropriate notation on the door 
area inspection sheet (Figure 303-2).

    Note: Multiple VE from the same door area (e.g., VE from both the 
chuck door and the push side door) are counted as only one emitting 
door, not as multiple emitting doors.

    11.2.3.3 Do not record the following sources as door area VE:
    11.2.3.3.1 VE from ovens with doors removed. Record the oven number 
and make an appropriate notation under ``Comments;''
    11.2.3.3.2 VE from ovens taken out of service. The owner or operator 
shall notify the observer as to which ovens are out of service. Record 
the oven number and make an appropriate notation under ``Comments;'' or
    11.2.3.3.3 VE from hot coke that has been spilled on the bench as a 
result of pushing.
    11.2.4 Criteria for Acceptance. After completing the run, calculate 
the maximum time allowed to observe the ovens using the equation in 
Section 12.2. If the total traverse time exceeds T, void the run, and 
conduct another run to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of 
this part.
    11.2.5 Percent Leaking Doors. For each day on which a valid 
observation is obtained, calculate the daily 30-day rolling average for 
each battery using these data and the 29 previous valid daily 
observations, in accordance with Section 12.5.
    11.3 Procedure for Determining VE from Topside Port Lids and Offtake 
Systems.
    11.3.1 Number of Runs. Refer to Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of this part for 
the number of runs to be conducted. Simultaneous runs or separate runs 
for the topside port lids and offtake systems may be conducted.
    11.3.2 Battery Traverse. To conduct a topside traverse of the 
battery, walk the length of the battery at a steady, normal walking 
pace, pausing only to make appropriate entries on the topside inspection 
sheet (Figure 303-3). The walking pace shall not exceed an average rate 
of 4 seconds per oven, excluding time spent moving around stationary 
obstructions or waiting for other obstructions to move from positions 
blocking the view. Extra time is allowed for each leak for the observer 
to make the proper notation. A walking pace of 3 seconds per oven is 
typical. Record the actual traverse time with a stopwatch.
    11.3.3 Topside Port Lid Observations. To observe lids of the ovens 
involved in the charging operation, the observer shall wait to view the 
lids until approximately 5 minutes after the completion of the charge. 
Record all the information requested on the topside inspection sheet 
(Figure 303-3). Record the clock time when traverses begin and end. If 
the observer's view is obstructed during the traverse (e.g., steam from 
the coke wharf, larry car, etc.), follow the guidelines given in Section 
11.2.2.2.
    11.3.3.1 To perform a test run, conduct a single traverse on the 
topside of the battery. The observer shall walk near the center of the 
battery but may deviate from this path to avoid safety hazards (such as 
open or closed charging ports, luting buckets, lid removal bars, and 
topside port lids that have been removed) and any other obstacles. Upon 
noting VE from the topside port lid(s) of an oven, record the oven 
number and port number, then resume the traverse. If any oven is 
dampered-off from the collecting main for decarbonization, note this 
under ``Comments'' for that particular oven.

    Note: Count the number of topside ports, not the number of points, 
exhibiting VE, i.e., if a topside port has several points of VE, count 
this as one port exhibiting VE.

    11.3.3.2 Do not count the following as topside port lid VE:
    11.3.3.2.1 VE from between the brickwork and oven lid casing or VE 
from cracks in the oven brickwork. Note these VE under ``Comments;''
    11.3.3.2.2 VE from topside ports involved in a charging operation. 
Record the oven number, and make an appropriate notation (e.g., not 
observed because ports open for charging) under ``Comments;''
    11.3.3.2.3 Topside ports having maintenance work done. Record the 
oven number and make an appropriate notation under ``Comments;'' or
    11.3.3.2.4 Condensing water from wet-sealing material. Ports with 
only visible condensing water from wet-sealing material are counted as 
observed but not as having VE.
    11.3.3.2.5 Visible emissions from the flue inspection ports and 
caps.
    11.3.4 Offtake Systems Observations. To perform a test run, traverse 
the battery as in Section 11.3.3.1. Look ahead and back two to four 
ovens to get a clear view of the entire offtake system for each oven. 
Consider visible emissions from the following points as offtake system 
VE: (a) the flange between

[[Page 335]]

the gooseneck and collecting main (``saddle''), (b) the junction point 
of the standpipe and oven (``standpipe base''), (c) the other parts of 
the offtake system (e.g., the standpipe cap), and (d) the junction 
points with ovens and flanges of jumper pipes.
    11.3.4.1 Do not stray from the traverse line in order to get a 
``closer look'' at any part of the offtake system unless it is to 
distinguish leaks from interferences from other sources or to avoid 
obstacles.
    11.3.4.2 If the centerline does not provide a clear view of the 
entire offtake system for each oven (e.g., when standpipes are longer 
than 15 feet), the observer may conduct the traverse farther from 
(rather than closer to) the offtake systems.
    11.3.4.3 Upon noting a leak from an offtake system during a 
traverse, record the oven number. Resume the traverse. If the oven is 
dampered-off from the collecting main for decarbonization and VE are 
observed, note this under ``Comments'' for that particular oven.
    11.3.4.4 If any part or parts of an offtake system have VE, count it 
as one emitting offtake system. Each stationary jumper pipe is 
considered a single offtake system.
    11.3.4.5 Do not count standpipe caps open for a decarbonization 
period or standpipes of an oven being charged as source of offtake 
system VE. Record the oven number and write ``Not observed'' and the 
reason (i.e., decarb or charging) under ``Comments.''

    Note: VE from open standpipes of an oven being charged count as 
charging emissions. All VE from closed standpipe caps count as offtake 
leaks.

    11.3.5 Criteria for Acceptance. After completing the run (allow 2 
traverses for batteries with double mains), calculate the maximum time 
allowed to observe the topside port lids and/or offtake systems using 
the equation in Section 12.3. If the total traverse time exceeds T, void 
the run and conduct another run to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 
63.309(c)(1) of this part.
    11.3.6 In determining the percent leaking topside port lids and 
percent leaking offtake systems, do not include topside port lids or 
offtake systems with VE from the following ovens:
    11.3.6.1 Empty ovens, including ovens undergoing maintenance, which 
are properly dampered off from the main.
    11.3.6.2 Ovens being charged or being pushed.
    11.3.6.3 Up to 3 full ovens that have been dampered off from the 
main prior to pushing.
    11.3.6.4 Up to 3 additional full ovens in the pushing sequence that 
have been dampered off from the main for offtake system cleaning, for 
decarbonization, for safety reasons, or when a charging/pushing schedule 
involves widely separated ovens (e.g., a Marquard system); or that have 
been dampered off from the main for maintenance near the end of the 
coking cycle. Examples of reasons that ovens are dampered off for safety 
reasons are to avoid exposing workers in areas with insufficient 
clearance between standpipes and the larry car, or in areas where 
workers could be exposed to flames or hot gases from open standpipes, 
and to avoid the potential for removing a door on an oven that is not 
dampered off from the main.
    11.3.7 Percent Leaking Topside Port Lids and Offtake Systems. For 
each day on which a valid observation is obtained, calculate the daily 
30-day rolling average for each battery using these data and the 29 
previous valid daily observations, in accordance with Sections 12.6 and 
12.7.
    11.4 Procedure for Determining VE from Collecting Mains.
    11.4.1 Traverse. To perform a test run, traverse both the collecting 
main catwalk and the battery topside along the side closest to the 
collecting main. If the battery has a double main, conduct two sets of 
traverses for each run, i.e., one set for each main.
    11.4.2 Data Recording. Upon noting VE from any portion of a 
collection main, identify the source and approximate location of the 
source of VE and record the time under ``Collecting main'' on Figure 
303-3; then resume the traverse.
    11.4.3 Collecting Main Pressure Check. After the completion of the 
door traverse, the topside port lids, and offtake systems, compare the 
collecting main pressure during the inspection to the collecting main 
pressure during the previous 8 to 24 hours. Record the following: (a) 
the pressure during inspection, (b) presence of pressure deviation from 
normal operations, and (c) the explanation for any pressure deviation 
from normal operations, if any, offered by the operators. The owner or 
operator of the coke battery shall maintain the pressure recording 
equipment and conduct the quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) 
necessary to ensure reliable pressure readings and shall keep the QA/QC 
records for at least 6 months. The observer may periodically check the 
QA/QC records to determine their completeness. The owner or operator 
shall provide access to the records within 1 hour of an observer's 
request.

 Method 303A--Determination of Visible Emissions From Nonrecovery Coke 
                             Oven Batteries

    Note: This method does not include all of the specifications 
pertaining to observer certification. Some material is incorporated by 
reference from other methods in this part and in appendix A to 40 CFR 
Part 60. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, persons using this 
method should have a thorough knowledge of Method 9 and Method 303.

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination 
of visible emissions (VE) from leaking doors at nonrecovery coke oven 
batteries.

[[Page 341]]

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 A certified observer visually determines the VE from coke oven 
battery sources while walking at a normal pace. This method does not 
require that opacity of emissions be determined or that magnitude be 
differentiated.

                             3.0 Definitions

    3.1 Bench means the platform structure in front of the oven doors.
    3.2 Coke oven door means each end enclosure on the push side and the 
coking side of an oven.
    3.3 Coke side means the side of a battery from which the coke is 
discharged from ovens at the end of the coking cycle.
    3.4 Nonrecovery coke oven battery means a source consisting of a 
group of ovens connected by common walls and operated as a unit, where 
coal undergoes destructive distillation under negative pressure to 
produce coke, and which is designed for the combustion of coke oven gas 
from which by-products are not recovered.
    3.5 Operating oven means any oven not out of operation for rebuild 
or maintenance work extensive enough to require the oven to be skipped 
in the charging sequence.
    3.6 Oven means a chamber in the coke oven battery in which coal 
undergoes destructive distillation to produce coke.
    3.7 Push side means the side of the battery from which the coke is 
pushed from ovens at the end of the coking cycle.
    3.8 Run means the observation of visible emissions from coke oven 
doors in accordance with this method.
    3.9 Shed means an enclosure that covers the side of the coke oven 
battery, captures emissions from pushing operations and from leaking 
coke oven doors on the coke side or push side of the coke oven battery, 
and routes the emissions to a control device or system.
    3.10 Traverse time means accumulated time for a traverse as measured 
by a stopwatch. Traverse time includes time to stop and write down oven 
numbers but excludes time waiting for obstructions of view to clear or 
for time to walk around obstacles.
    3.11 Visible Emissions or VE means any emission seen by the unaided 
(except for corrective lenses) eye, excluding steam or condensing water.

                      4.0 Interferences [Reserved]

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, 
operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the 
safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the 
user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health 
practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations 
prior to performing this test method.
    5.2 Safety Training. Because coke oven batteries have hazardous 
environments, the training materials and the field training (Section 
10.0) shall cover the precautions required by the company to address 
health and safety hazards. Special emphasis shall be given to the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations 
pertaining to exposure of coke oven workers (see Reference 3 in Section 
16.0). In general, the regulation requires that special fire-retardant 
clothing and respirators be worn in certain restricted areas of the coke 
oven battery. The OSHA regulation also prohibits certain activities, 
such as chewing gum, smoking, and eating in these areas.

                  6.0 Equipment and Supplies [Reserved]

                  7.0 Reagents and Standards [Reserved]

 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage [Reserved]

                     9.0 Quality Control [Reserved]

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization.

    10.1 Training. This method requires only the determination of 
whether VE occur and does not require the determination of opacity 
levels; therefore, observer certification according to Method 9 in 
Appendix A to Part 60 is not required. However, the first-time observer 
(trainee) shall have attended the lecture portion of the Method 9 
certification course. Furthermore, before conducting any VE 
observations, an observer shall become familiar with nonrecovery coke 
oven battery operations and with this test method by observing for a 
minimum of 4 hours the operation of a nonrecovery coke oven battery in 
the presence of personnel experienced in performing Method 303 
assessments.

                             11.0 Procedure

    The intent of this procedure is to determine VE from coke oven door 
areas by carefully observing the door area while walking at a normal 
pace.
    11.1 Number of Runs. Refer to Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of this part for 
the appropriate number of runs.
    11.2 Battery Traverse. To conduct a battery traverse, walk the 
length of the battery on the outside of the pusher machine and quench 
car tracks at a steady, normal walking pace, pausing to make appropriate 
entries on the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303A-1). The walking 
pace shall be such that the duration of the traverse does not exceed an 
average of 4 seconds per oven door, excluding time spent moving around 
stationary obstructions or waiting for other obstructions to move from 
positions blocking the view of a series of doors. Extra time is

[[Page 342]]

allowed for each leak (a maximum of 10 additional seconds for each 
leaking door) for the observer to make the proper notation. A walking 
pace of 3 seconds per oven door has been found to be typical. Record the 
actual traverse time with a stopwatch. A single test run consists of two 
timed traverses, one for the coke side and one for the push side.
    11.2.1 Various situations may arise that will prevent the observer 
from viewing a door or a series of doors. The observer has two options 
for dealing with obstructions to view: (a) Wait for the equipment to 
move or the fugitive emissions to dissipate before completing the 
traverse; or (b) skip the affected ovens and move to an unobstructed 
position to continue the traverse. Continue the traverse. After the 
completion of the traverse, if the equipment has moved or the fugitive 
emissions have dissipated, complete the traverse by inspecting the 
affected doors. Record the oven numbers and make an appropriate notation 
under ``Comments'' on the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303A-1).

    Note: Extra time incurred for handling obstructions is not counted 
in the traverse time.

    11.2.2 When batteries have sheds to control pushing emissions, 
conduct the inspection from outside the shed, if the shed allows such 
observations, or from the bench. Be aware of special safety 
considerations pertinent to walking on the bench and follow the 
instructions of company personnel on the required equipment and 
operations procedures. If possible, conduct the bench traverse whenever 
the bench is clear of the door machine and hot coke guide.
    11.3 Observations. Record all the information requested at the top 
of the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303A-1), including the number 
of non-operating ovens. Record which side is being inspected, i.e., coke 
side or push side. Other information may be recorded at the discretion 
of the observer, such as the location of the leak (e.g., top of the 
door), the reason for any interruption of the traverse, or the position 
of the sun relative to the battery and sky conditions (e.g., overcast, 
partly sunny, etc.).
    11.3.1 Begin the test run by traversing either the coke side or the 
push side of the battery. After completing one side, traverse the other 
side.
    11.3.2 During the traverse, look around the entire perimeter of each 
oven door. The door is considered leaking if VE are detected in the coke 
oven door area. The coke oven door area includes the entire area on the 
vertical face of a coke oven between the bench and the top of the 
battery and the adjacent doors on both sides. Record the oven number and 
make the appropriate notation on the door area inspection sheet (Figure 
303A-1).
    11.3.3 Do not record the following sources as door area VE:
    11.3.3.1 VE from ovens with doors removed. Record the oven number 
and make an appropriate notation under ``Comments'';
    11.3.3.2 VE from ovens where maintenance work is being conducted. 
Record the oven number and make an appropriate notation under 
``Comments''; or
    11.3.3.3 VE from hot coke that has been spilled on the bench as a 
result of pushing.

Method 304A: Determination of Biodegradation Rates of Organic Compounds 
                              (Vent Option)

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination 
of biodegradation rates of organic compounds in an activated sludge 
process. The test method is designed to evaluate the ability of an 
aerobic biological reaction system to degrade or destroy specific 
components in waste streams. The method may also be used to determine 
the effects of changes in wastewater composition on operation. The 
biodegradation rates determined by utilizing this method are not 
representative of a full-scale system. The rates measured by this method 
shall be used in conjunction with the procedures listed in appendix C of 
this part to calculate the fraction emitted to the air versus the 
fraction biodegraded.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 A self-contained benchtop bioreactor system is assembled in the 
laboratory. A sample of mixed liquor is added and the waste stream is 
then fed continuously. The benchtop bioreactor is operated under 
conditions nearly identical to the target full-scale activated sludge 
process. Bioreactor temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, average 
residence time in the reactor, waste composition, biomass concentration, 
and biomass composition of the full-scale process are the parameters 
which are duplicated in the benchtop bioreactor. Biomass shall be 
removed from the target full-scale activated sludge unit and held for no 
more than 4 hours prior to use in the benchtop bioreactor. If 
antifoaming agents are used in the full-scale system, they shall also be 
used in the benchtop bioreactor. The feed flowing into and the effluent 
exiting the benchtop bioreactor are analyzed to determine the 
biodegradation rates of the target compounds. The flow rate of the exit 
vent is used to calculate the concentration of target compounds 
(utilizing Henry's law) in the exit gas stream. If Henry's law constants 
for the compounds of interest are not known, this method cannot be used 
in the determination of the biodegradation rate and Method 304B is the 
suggested method. The choice of analytical methodology for measuring the 
compounds of interest at the inlet and outlet to the benchtop bioreactor 
are left to the discretion of the source, except where validated methods 
are available.

                       3.0 Definitions [Reserved]

                      4.0 Interferences [Reserved]

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 If explosive gases are produced as a byproduct of biodegradation 
and could realistically pose a hazard, closely monitor headspace 
concentration of these gases to ensure laboratory safety. Placement of 
the benchtop bioreactor system inside a laboratory hood is recommended 
regardless of byproducts produced.

                       6.0. Equipment and Supplies

    Note: Figure 304A-1 illustrates a typical laboratory apparatus used 
to measure biodegradation rates. While the following description refers 
to Figure 304A-1, the EPA recognizes that alternative reactor 
configurations, such as alternative reactor shapes and locations of 
probes and the feed inlet, will also meet the intent of this method. 
Ensure that the benchtop bioreactor system is self-contained and 
isolated from the atmosphere (except for the exit vent stream) by leak-
checking fittings, tubing, etc.

    6.1 Benchtop Bioreactor. The biological reaction is conducted in a 
biological oxidation reactor of at least 6 liters capacity. The benchtop 
bioreactor is sealed and equipped with internal probes for controlling 
and monitoring dissolved oxygen and internal temperature. The top of the 
reactor is equipped for aerators, gas flow ports, and instrumentation 
(while ensuring that no leaks to the atmosphere exist around the 
fittings).
    6.2 Aeration gas. Aeration gas is added to the benchtop bioreactor 
through three diffusers, which are glass tubes that extend to the bottom 
fifth of the reactor depth. A pure oxygen pressurized cylinder is 
recommended in order to maintain the specified oxygen concentration. 
Install a blower (e.g., Diaphragm Type, 15 SCFH capacity) to blow the 
aeration gas into the reactor diffusers. Measure the aeration gas flow 
rate with a rotameter (e.g., 0-15 SCFH recommended). The aeration gas 
will rise through the benchtop bioreactor, dissolving oxygen into the 
mixture in the process. The aeration gas must provide sufficient 
agitation to keep the solids in suspension. Provide an exit for the 
aeration gas from the top flange of the benchtop bioreactor through a 
water-cooled (e.g., Allihn-type) vertical condenser. Install the 
condenser through a gas-tight fitting in the benchtop bioreactor 
closure. Install a splitter which directs a portion of the gas to an 
exit vent and the rest of the gas through an air recycle pump back to 
the benchtop bioreactor. Monitor and record the flow rate through the 
exit vent at least 3 times per day throughout the day.
    6.3 Wastewater Feed. Supply the wastewater feed to the benchtop 
bioreactor in a collapsible low-density polyethylene container or 
collapsible liner in a container (e.g., 20 L) equipped with a spigot cap 
(collapsible containers or liners of other material may be required due 
to the permeability of some volatile compounds through polyethylene). 
Obtain the wastewater feed by sampling the wastewater feed in the target 
process. A representative sample of wastewater shall be obtained from 
the piping leading to the aeration tank. This sample may be obtained 
from existing sampling valves at the discharge of the wastewater feed 
pump, or collected from a pipe discharging to the aeration tank, or by 
pumping from a well-mixed equalization tank upstream from the aeration 
tank. Alternatively, wastewater can be pumped continuously to the 
laboratory apparatus from a bleed stream taken from the equalization 
tank of the full-scale treatment system.
    6.3.1 Refrigeration System. Keep the wastewater feed cool by ice or 
by refrigeration to 4 [deg]C. If using a bleed stream from the 
equalization tank, refrigeration is not required if the residence time 
in the bleed stream is less than five minutes.
    6.3.2 Wastewater Feed Pump. The wastewater is pumped from the 
refrigerated container using a variable-speed peristaltic pump drive 
equipped with a peristaltic pump head. Add the feed solution to the 
benchtop bioreactor through a fitting on the top flange. Determine the 
rate of feed addition to provide a retention time in the benchtop 
bioreactor that is numerically equivalent to the retention time in the 
full-scale system. The wastewater shall be fed at a rate sufficient to 
achieve 90 to 100 percent of the full-scale system residence time.
    6.3.3 Treated wastewater feed. The benchtop bioreactor effluent 
exits at the bottom of the reactor through a tube and proceeds to the 
clarifier.
    6.4 Clarifier. The effluent flows to a separate closed clarifier 
that allows separation of biomass and effluent (e.g., 2-liter pear-
shaped glass separatory funnel, modified by removing the stopcock and 
adding a 25-mm OD glass tube at the bottom). Benchtop bioreactor 
effluent enters the clarifier through a tube inserted to a depth of 0.08 
m (3 in.) through a stopper at the top of the clarifier. System effluent 
flows from a tube inserted through the stopper at the top of the 
clarifier to a drain (or sample bottle when sampling). The underflow 
from the clarifier leaves from the glass tube at the bottom of the 
clarifier. Flexible tubing connects this fitting to the sludge recycle 
pump. This pump is coupled to a variable speed pump drive. The discharge 
from this pump is returned through a tube inserted in a port on the side 
of the benchtop bioreactor. An additional port is provided near the 
bottom of the benchtop bioreactor for sampling the reactor contents. The 
mixed liquor from the

[[Page 345]]

benchtop bioreactor flows into the center of the clarifier. The 
clarified system effluent separates from the biomass and flows through 
an exit near the top of the clarifier. There shall be no headspace in 
the clarifier.
    6.5 Temperature Control Apparatus. Capable of maintaining the system 
at a temperature equal to the temperature of the full-scale system. The 
average temperature should be maintained within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 
[deg]C of the set point.
    6.5.1 Temperature Monitoring Device. A resistance type temperature 
probe or a thermocouple connected to a temperature readout with a 
resolution of 0.1 [deg]C or better.
    6.5.2 Benchtop Bioreactor Heater. The heater is connected to the 
temperature control device.
    6.6 Oxygen Control System. Maintain the dissolved oxygen 
concentration at the levels present in the full-scale system. Target 
full-scale activated sludge systems with dissolved oxygen concentration 
below 2 mg/L are required to maintain the dissolved oxygen concentration 
in the benchtop ioreactor within 0.5 mg/L of the target dissolved oxygen 
level. Target full-scale activated sludge systems with dissolved oxygen 
concentration above 2 mg/L are required to maintain the dissolved oxygen 
concentration in the benchtop bioreactor within 1.5 mg/L of the target 
dissolved oxygen concentration; however, for target full-scale activated 
sludge systems with dissolved oxygen concentrations above 2 mg/L, the 
dissolved oxygen concentration in the benchtop bioreactor may not drop 
below 1.5 mg/L. If the benchtop bioreactor is outside the control range, 
the dissolved oxygen is noted and the reactor operation is adjusted.
    6.6.1 Dissolved Oxygen Monitor. Dissolved oxygen is monitored with a 
polarographic probe (gas permeable membrane) connected to a dissolved 
oxygen meter (e.g., 0 to 15 mg/L, 0 to 50 [deg]C).
    6.6.2 Benchtop Bioreactor Pressure Monitor. The benchtop bioreactor 
pressure is monitored through a port in the top flange of the reactor. 
This is connected to a gauge control with a span of 13-cm water vacuum 
to 13-cm water pressure or better. A relay is activated when the vacuum 
exceeds an adjustable setpoint which opens a solenoid valve (normally 
closed), admitting oxygen to the system. The vacuum setpoint controlling 
oxygen addition to the system shall be set at approximately 2.5 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 cm water and maintained at this setting except 
during brief periods when the dissolved oxygen concentration is 
adjusted.
    6.7 Connecting Tubing. All connecting tubing shall be Teflon or 
equivalent in impermeability. The only exception to this specification 
is the tubing directly inside the pump head of the wastewater feed pump, 
which may be Viton, Silicone or another type of flexible tubing.
    Note: Mention of trade names or products does not constitute 
endorsement by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards

    7.1 Wastewater. Obtain a representative sample of wastewater at the 
inlet to the full-scale treatment plant if there is an existing full-
scale treatment plant (see section 6.3). If there is no existing full-
scale treatment plant, obtain the wastewater sample as close to the 
point of determination as possible. Collect the sample by pumping the 
wastewater into the 20-L collapsible container. The loss of volatiles 
shall be minimized from the wastewater by collapsing the container 
before filling, by minimizing the time of filling, and by avoiding a 
headspace in the container after filling. If the wastewater requires the 
addition of nutrients to support the biomass growth and maintain biomass 
characteristics, those nutrients are added and mixed with the container 
contents after the container is filled.
    7.2 Biomass. Obtain the biomass or activated sludge used for rate 
constant determination in the bench-scale process from the existing 
full-scale process or from a representative biomass culture (e.g., 
biomass that has been developed for a future full-scale process). This 
biomass is preferentially obtained from a thickened acclimated mixed 
liquor sample. Collect the sample either by bailing from the mixed 
liquor in the aeration tank with a weighted container, or by collecting 
aeration tank effluent at the effluent overflow weir. Transport the 
sample to the laboratory within no more than 4 hours of collection. 
Maintain the biomass concentration in the benchtop bioreactor at the 
level of the full-scale system +10 percent throughout the sampling 
period of the test method.

       8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport

    8.1 Benchtop Bioreactor Operation. Charge the mixed liquor to the 
benchtop bioreactor, minimizing headspace over the liquid surface to 
minimize entrainment of mixed liquor in the circulating gas. Fasten the 
benchtop bioreactor headplate to the reactor over the liquid surface. 
Maintain the temperature of the contents of the benchtop bioreactor 
system at the temperature of the target full-scale system, <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 [deg]C, throughout the testing period. Monitor and 
record the temperature of the benchtop bioreactor contents at least to 
the nearest 0.1 [deg]C.
    8.1.1 Wastewater Storage. Collect the wastewater sample in the 20-L 
collapsible container. Store the container at 4 [deg]C throughout the 
testing period. Connect the container to the benchtop bioreactor feed 
pump.
    8.1.2 Wastewater Flow Rate.

[[Page 346]]

    8.1.2.1 The hydraulic residence time of the aeration tank is 
calculated as the ratio of the volume of the tank (L) to the flow rate 
(L/min). At the beginning of a test, the container shall be connected to 
the feed pump and solution shall be pumped to the benchtop bioreactor at 
the required flow rate to achieve the calculated hydraulic residence 
time of wastewater in the aeration tank.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.547

Where:

Q<INF>test</INF> = wastewater flow rate (L/min)
Q<INF>fs</INF> = average flow rate of full-scale process (L/min)
V<INF>fs</INF> = volume of full-scale aeration tank (L)

    8.1.2.2 The target flow rate in the test apparatus is the same as 
the flow rate in the target full-scale process multiplied by the ratio 
of benchtop bioreactor volume (e.g., 6 L) to the volume of the full-
scale aeration tank. The hydraulic residence time shall be maintained at 
90 to 100 percent of the residence time maintained in the full-scale 
unit. A nominal flow rate is set on the pump based on a pump 
calibration. Changes in the elasticity of the tubing in the pump head 
and the accumulation of material in the tubing affect this calibration. 
The nominal pumping rate shall be changed as necessary based on 
volumetric flow measurements. Discharge the benchtop bioreactor effluent 
to a wastewater storage, treatment, or disposal facility, except during 
sampling or flow measurement periods.
    8.1.3 Sludge Recycle Rate. Set the sludge recycle rate at a rate 
sufficient to prevent accumulation in the bottom of the clarifier. Set 
the air circulation rate sufficient to maintain the biomass in 
suspension.
    8.1.4 Benchtop Bioreactor Operation and Maintenance. Temperature, 
dissolved oxygen concentration, exit vent flow rate, benchtop bioreactor 
effluent flow rate, and air circulation rate shall be measured and 
recorded three times throughout each day of benchtop bioreactor 
operation. If other parameters (such as pH) are measured and maintained 
in the target full-scale unit, these parameters, where appropriate, 
shall be monitored and maintained to target full-scale specifications in 
the benchtop bioreactor. At the beginning of each sampling period 
(Section 8.2), sample the benchtop bioreactor contents for suspended 
solids analysis. Take this sample by loosening a clamp on a length of 
tubing attached to the lower side port. Determine the suspended solids 
gravimetrically by the Gooch crucible/glass fiber filter method for 
total suspended solids, in accordance with Standard Methods\3\ or 
equivalent. When necessary, sludge shall be wasted from the lower side 
port of the benchtop bioreactor, and the volume that is wasted shall be 
replaced with an equal volume of the reactor effluent. Add thickened 
activated sludge mixed liquor as necessary to the benchtop bioreactor to 
increase the suspended solids concentration to the desired level. Pump 
this mixed liquor to the benchtop bioreactor through the upper side port 
(Item 24 in Figure 304A-1). Change the membrane on the dissolved oxygen 
probe before starting the test. Calibrate the oxygen probe immediately 
before the start of the test and each time the membrane is changed.
    8.1.5 Inspection and Correction Procedures. If the feed line tubing 
becomes clogged, replace with new tubing. If the feed flow rate is not 
within 5 percent of target flow any time the flow rate is measured, 
reset pump or check the flow measuring device and measure flow rate 
again until target flow rate is achieved.
    8.2 Test Sampling. At least two and one half hydraulic residence 
times after the system has reached the targeted specifications shall be 
permitted to elapse before the first sample is taken. Effluent samples 
of the clarifier discharge (Item 20 in Figure 304A-1) and the influent 
wastewater feed are collected in 40-mL septum vials to which two drops 
of 1:10 hydrochloric acid (HCl) in water have been added. Sample the 
clarifier discharge directly from the drain line. These samples will be 
composed of the entire flow from the system for a period of several 
minutes. Feed samples shall be taken from the feed pump suction line 
after temporarily stopping the benchtop bioreactor feed, removing a 
connector, and squeezing the collapsible feed container. Store both 
influent and effluent samples at 4 [deg]C immediately after collection 
and analyze within 8 hours of collection.
    8.2.1 Frequency of Sampling. During the test, sample and analyze the 
wastewater feed and the clarifier effluent at least six times. The 
sampling intervals shall be separated by at least 8 hours. During any 
individual sampling interval, sample the wastewater feed simultaneously 
with or immediately after the effluent sample. Calculate the relative 
standard deviation (RSD) of the amount removed (i.e., effluent 
concentration--wastewater feed concentration). The RSD values shall be < 
15 percent. If an RSD value is <ls-thn-eq> 15

[[Page 347]]

percent, continue sampling and analyzing influent and effluent sets of 
samples until the RSD values are within specifications.
    8.2.2 Sampling After Exposure of System to Atmosphere. If, after 
starting sampling procedures, the benchtop bioreactor system is exposed 
to the atmosphere (due to leaks, maintenance, etc.), allow at least one 
hydraulic residence time to elapse before resuming sampling.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 Dissolved Oxygen. Fluctuation in dissolved oxygen concentration 
may occur for numerous reasons, including undetected gas leaks, 
increases and decreases in mixed liquor suspended solids resulting from 
cell growth and solids loss in the effluent stream, changes in diffuser 
performance, cycling of effluent flow rate, and overcorrection due to 
faulty or sluggish dissolved oxygen probe response. Control the 
dissolved oxygen concentration in the benchtop bioreactor by changing 
the proportion of oxygen in the circulating aeration gas. Should the 
dissolved oxygen concentration drift below the designated experimental 
condition, bleed a small amount of aeration gas from the system on the 
pressure side (i.e., immediately upstream of one of the diffusers). This 
will create a vacuum in the system, triggering the pressure sensitive 
relay to open the solenoid valve and admit oxygen to the system. Should 
the dissolved oxygen concentration drift above the designated 
experimental condition, slow or stop the oxygen input to the system 
until the dissolved oxygen concentration approaches the correct level.
    9.2 Sludge Wasting.
    9.2.1 Determine the suspended solids concentration (section 8.1.4) 
at the beginning of a test, and once per day thereafter during the test. 
If the test is completed within a two day period, determine the 
suspended solids concentration after the final sample set is taken. If 
the suspended solids concentration exceeds the specified concentration, 
remove a fraction of the sludge from the benchtop bioreactor. The 
required volume of mixed liquor to remove is determined as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.548

Where:

V<INF>w</INF> is the wasted volume (Liters),
V<INF>r</INF> is the volume of the benchtop bioreactor (Liters),
S<INF>m</INF> is the measured solids (g/L), and
S<INF>s</INF> is the specified solids (g/L).

    9.2.2 Remove the mixed liquor from the benchtop bioreactor by 
loosening a clamp on the mixed liquor sampling tube and allowing the 
required volume to drain to a graduated flask. Clamp the tube when the 
correct volume has been wasted. Replace the volume of the liquid wasted 
by pouring the same volume of effluent back into the benchtop 
bioreactor. Dispose of the waste sludge properly.
    9.3 Sludge Makeup. In the event that the suspended solids 
concentration is lower than the specifications, add makeup sludge back 
into the benchtop bioreactor. Determine the amount of sludge added by 
the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.549

Where:

V<INF>w</INF> is the volume of sludge to add (Liters),
V<INF>r</INF> is the volume of the benchtop bioreactor (Liters),
S<INF>w</INF> is the solids in the makeup sludge (g/L),
S<INF>m</INF> is the measured solids (g/L), and S<INF>s</INF> is the 
specified solids (g/L).

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    10.1 Wastewater Pump Calibration. Determine the wastewater flow rate 
by collecting the system effluent for a time period of at least one 
hour, and measuring the volume with a graduated cylinder. Record the 
collection time period and volume collected. Determine flow rate. Adjust 
the pump speed to deliver the specified flow rate.

[[Page 348]]

    10.2 Calibration Standards. Prepare calibration standards from pure 
certified standards in an aqueous medium. Prepare and analyze three 
concentrations of calibration standards for each target component (or 
for a mixture of components) in triplicate daily throughout the analyses 
of the test samples. At each concentration level, a single calibration 
shall be within 5 percent of the average of the three calibration 
results. The low and medium calibration standards shall bracket the 
expected concentration of the effluent (treated) wastewater. The medium 
and high standards shall bracket the expected influent concentration.

                       11.0 Analytical Procedures

    11.1 Analysis. If the identity of the compounds of interest in the 
wastewater is not known, a representative sample of the wastewater shall 
be analyzed in order to identify all of the compounds of interest 
present. A gas chromatography/mass spectrometry screening method is 
recommended.
    11.1.1 After identifying the compounds of interest in the 
wastewater, develop and/or use one or more analytical techniques capable 
of measuring each of those compounds (more than one analytical technique 
may be required, depending on the characteristics of the wastewater). 
Test Method 18, found in appendix A of 40 CFR 60, may be used as a 
guideline in developing the analytical technique. Purge and trap 
techniques may be used for analysis providing the target components are 
sufficiently volatile to make this technique appropriate. The limit of 
quantitation for each compound shall be determined (see reference 1). If 
the effluent concentration of any target compound is below the limit of 
quantitation determined for that compound, the operation of the Method 
304 unit may be altered to attempt to increase the effluent 
concentration above the limit of quantitation. Modifications to the 
method shall be approved prior to the test. The request should be 
addressed to Method 304 contact, Emissions Measurement Center, Mail Drop 
19, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 
27711.

Method 304B: Determination of Biodegradation Rates of Organic Compounds 
                            (Scrubber Option)

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination 
of biodegradation rates of organic compounds in an activated sludge 
process. The test method is designed to evaluate the ability of an 
aerobic biological reaction system to degrade or destroy specific 
components in waste streams. The method may also be used to determine 
the effects of changes in wastewater composition on operation. The 
biodegradation rates determined by utilizing this method are not 
representative of a full-scale system. Full-scale systems embody 
biodegradation and air

[[Page 351]]

emissions in competing reactions. This method measures biodegradation in 
absence of air emissions. The rates measured by this method shall be 
used in conjunction with the procedures listed in appendix C of this 
part to calculate the fraction emitted to the air versus the fraction 
biodegraded.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 A self-contained benchtop bioreactor system is assembled in the 
laboratory. A sample of mixed liquor is added and the waste stream is 
then fed continuously. The benchtop bioreactor is operated under 
conditions nearly identical to the target full-scale activated sludge 
process, except that air emissions are not a factor. The benchtop 
bioreactor temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, average 
residence time in the reactor, waste composition, biomass concentration, 
and biomass composition of the target full-scale process are the 
parameters which are duplicated in the laboratory system. Biomass shall 
be removed from the target full-scale activated sludge unit and held for 
no more than 4 hours prior to use in the benchtop bioreactor. If 
antifoaming agents are used in the full-scale system, they shall also be 
used in the benchtop bioreactor. The feed flowing into and the effluent 
exiting the benchtop bioreactor are analyzed to determine the 
biodegradation rates of the target compounds. The choice of analytical 
methodology for measuring the compounds of interest at the inlet and 
outlet to the benchtop bioreactor are left to the discretion of the 
source, except where validated methods are available.

                       3.0 Definitions [Reserved]

                      4.0 Interferences [Reserved]

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 If explosive gases are produced as a byproduct of biodegradation 
and could realistically pose a hazard, closely monitor headspace 
concentration of these gases to ensure laboratory safety. Placement of 
the benchtop bioreactor system inside a laboratory hood is recommended 
regardless of byproducts produced.

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

    Note: Figure 304B-1 illustrates a typical laboratory apparatus used 
to measure biodegradation rates. While the following description refers 
to Figure 304B-1, the EPA recognizes that alternative reactor 
configurations, such as alternative reactor shapes and locations of 
probes and the feed inlet, will also meet the intent of this method. 
Ensure that the benchtop bioreactor system is self-contained and 
isolated from the atmosphere by leak-checking fittings, tubing, etc.
    6.1 Benchtop Bioreactor. The biological reaction is conducted in a 
biological oxidation reactor of at least 6-liters capacity. The benchtop 
bioreactor is sealed and equipped with internal probes for controlling 
and monitoring dissolved oxygen and internal temperature. The top of the 
benchtop bioreactor is equipped for aerators, gas flow ports, and 
instrumentation (while ensuring that no leaks to the atmosphere exist 
around the fittings).
    6.2 Aeration gas. Aeration gas is added to the benchtop bioreactor 
through three diffusers, which are glass tubes that extend to the bottom 
fifth of the reactor depth. A pure oxygen pressurized cylinder is 
recommended in order to maintain the specified oxygen concentration. 
Install a blower (e.g., Diaphragm Type, 15 SCFH capacity) to blow the 
aeration gas into the benchtop bioreactor diffusers. Measure the 
aeration gas flow rate with a rotameter (e.g., 0-15 SCFH recommended). 
The aeration gas will rise through the benchtop bioreactor, dissolving 
oxygen into the mixture in the process. The aeration gas must provide 
sufficient agitation to keep the solids in suspension. Provide an exit 
for the aeration gas from the top flange of the benchtop bioreactor 
through a water-cooled (e.g., Allihn-type) vertical condenser. Install 
the condenser through a gas-tight fitting in the benchtop bioreactor 
closure. Design the system so that at least 10 percent of the gas flows 
through an alkaline scrubber containing 175 mL of 45 percent by weight 
solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH) and 5 drops of 0.2 percent 
alizarin yellow dye. Route the balance of the gas through an adjustable 
scrubber bypass. Route all of the gas through a 1-L knock-out flask to 
remove entrained moisture and then to the intake of the blower. The 
blower recirculates the gas to the benchtop bioreactor.
    6.3 Wastewater Feed. Supply the wastewater feed to the benchtop 
bioreactor in a collapsible low-density polyethylene container or 
collapsible liner in a container (e.g., 20 L) equipped with a spigot cap 
(collapsible containers or liners of other material may be required due 
to the permeability of some volatile compounds through polyethylene). 
Obtain the wastewater feed by sampling the wastewater feed in the target 
process. A representative sample of wastewater shall be obtained from 
the piping leading to the aeration tank. This sample may be obtained 
from existing sampling valves at the discharge of the wastewater feed 
pump, or collected from a pipe discharging to the aeration tank, or by 
pumping from a well-mixed equalization tank upstream from the aeration 
tank. Alternatively, wastewater can be pumped continuously to the 
laboratory apparatus from a bleed stream taken from the equalization 
tank of the full-scale treatment system.
    6.3.1 Refrigeration System. Keep the wastewater feed cool by ice or 
by refrigeration to 4 [deg]C. If using a bleed stream from the

[[Page 352]]

equalization tank, refrigeration is not required if the residence time 
in the bleed stream is less than five minutes.
    6.3.2 Wastewater Feed Pump. The wastewater is pumped from the 
refrigerated container using a variable-speed peristaltic pump drive 
equipped with a peristaltic pump head. Add the feed solution to the 
benchtop bioreactor through a fitting on the top flange. Determine the 
rate of feed addition to provide a retention time in the benchtop 
bioreactor that is numerically equivalent to the retention time in the 
target full-scale system. The wastewater shall be fed at a rate 
sufficient to achieve 90 to 100 percent of the target full-scale system 
residence time.
    6.3.3 Treated wastewater feed. The benchtop bioreactor effluent 
exits at the bottom of the reactor through a tube and proceeds to the 
clarifier.
    6.4 Clarifier. The effluent flows to a separate closed clarifier 
that allows separation of biomass and effluent (e.g., 2-liter pear-
shaped glass separatory funnel, modified by removing the stopcock and 
adding a 25-mm OD glass tube at the bottom). Benchtop bioreactor 
effluent enters the clarifier through a tube inserted to a depth of 0.08 
m (3 in.) through a stopper at the top of the clarifier. System effluent 
flows from a tube inserted through the stopper at the top of the 
clarifier to a drain (or sample bottle when sampling). The underflow 
from the clarifier leaves from the glass tube at the bottom of the 
clarifier. Flexible tubing connects this fitting to the sludge recycle 
pump. This pump is coupled to a variable speed pump drive. The discharge 
from this pump is returned through a tube inserted in a port on the side 
of the benchtop bioreactor. An additional port is provided near the 
bottom of the benchtop bioreactor for sampling the reactor contents. The 
mixed liquor from the benchtop bioreactor flows into the center of the 
clarifier. The clarified system effluent separates from the biomass and 
flows through an exit near the top of the clarifier. There shall be no 
headspace in the clarifier.
    6.5 Temperature Control Apparatus. Capable of maintaining the system 
at a temperature equal to the temperature of the full-scale system. The 
average temperature should be maintained within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 
[deg]C of the set point.
    6.5.1 Temperature Monitoring Device. A resistance type temperature 
probe or a thermocouple connected to a temperature readout with a 
resolution of 0.1 [deg]C or better.
    6.5.2 Benchtop Bioreactor Heater. The heater is connected to the 
temperature control device.
    6.6 Oxygen Control System. Maintain the dissolved oxygen 
concentration at the levels present in the full-scale system. Target 
full-scale activated sludge systems with dissolved oxygen concentration 
below 2 mg/L are required to maintain the dissolved oxygen concentration 
in the benchtop bioreactor within 0.5 mg/L of the target dissolved 
oxygen level. Target full-scale activated sludge systems with dissolved 
oxygen concentration above 2 mg/L are required to maintain the dissolved 
oxygen concentration in the benchtop bioreactor within 1.5 mg/L of the 
target dissolved oxygen concentration; however, for target full-scale 
activated sludge systems with dissolved oxygen concentrations above 2 
mg/L, the dissolved oxygen concentration in the benchtop bioreactor may 
not drop below 1.5 mg/L. If the benchtop bioreactor is outside the 
control range, the dissolved oxygen is noted and the reactor operation 
is adjusted.
    6.6.1 Dissolved Oxygen Monitor. Dissolved oxygen is monitored with a 
polarographic probe (gas permeable membrane) connected to a dissolved 
oxygen meter (e.g., 0 to 15 mg/L, 0 to 50 [deg]C).
    6.6.2 Benchtop Bioreactor Pressure Monitor. The benchtop bioreactor 
pressure is monitored through a port in the top flange of the reactor. 
This is connected to a gauge control with a span of 13-cm water vacuum 
to 13-cm water pressure or better. A relay is activated when the vacuum 
exceeds an adjustable setpoint which opens a solenoid valve (normally 
closed), admitting oxygen to the system. The vacuum setpoint controlling 
oxygen addition to the system shall be set at approximately 2.5 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 cm water and maintained at this setting except 
during brief periods when the dissolved oxygen concentration is 
adjusted.
    6.7 Connecting Tubing. All connecting tubing shall be Teflon or 
equivalent in impermeability. The only exception to this specification 
is the tubing directly inside the pump head of the wastewater feed pump, 
which may be Viton, Silicone or another type of flexible tubing.
    Note: Mention of trade names or products does not constitute 
endorsement by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

                       7.0. Reagents and Standards

    7.1 Wastewater. Obtain a representative sample of wastewater at the 
inlet to the full-scale treatment plant if there is an existing full-
scale treatment plant (See Section 6.3). If there is no existing full-
scale treatment plant, obtain the wastewater sample as close to the 
point of determination as possible. Collect the sample by pumping the 
wastewater into the 20-L collapsible container. The loss of volatiles 
shall be minimized from the wastewater by collapsing the container 
before filling, by minimizing the time of filling, and by avoiding a 
headspace in the container after filling. If the wastewater requires the 
addition of nutrients to support the biomass growth and maintain biomass 
characteristics, those nutrients are added and mixed with the container 
contents after the container is filled.

[[Page 353]]

    7.2 Biomass. Obtain the biomass or activated sludge used for rate 
constant determination in the bench-scale process from the existing 
full-scale process or from a representative biomass culture (e.g., 
biomass that has been developed for a future full-scale process). This 
biomass is preferentially obtained from a thickened acclimated mixed 
liquor sample. Collect the sample either by bailing from the mixed 
liquor in the aeration tank with a weighted container, or by collecting 
aeration tank effluent at the effluent overflow weir. Transport the 
sample to the laboratory within no more than 4 hours of collection. 
Maintain the biomass concentration in the benchtop bioreactor at the 
level of the target full-scale system +10 percent throughout the 
sampling period of the test method.

       8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport

    8.1 Benchtop Bioreactor Operation. Charge the mixed liquor to the 
benchtop bioreactor, minimizing headspace over the liquid surface to 
minimize entrainment of mixed liquor in the circulating gas. Fasten the 
benchtop bioreactor headplate to the reactor over the liquid surface. 
Maintain the temperature of the contents of the benchtop bioreactor 
system at the temperature of the target full-scale system, <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 [deg]C, throughout the testing period. Monitor and 
record the temperature of the reactor contents at least to the nearest 
0.1 [deg]C.
    8.1.1 Wastewater Storage. Collect the wastewater sample in the 20-L 
collapsible container. Store the container at 4 [deg]C throughout the 
testing period. Connect the container to the benchtop bioreactor feed 
pump.
    8.1.2 Wastewater Flow Rate.
    8.1.2.1 The hydraulic residence time of the aeration tank is 
calculated as the ratio of the volume of the tank (L) to the flow rate 
(L/min). At the beginning of a test, the container shall be connected to 
the feed pump and solution shall be pumped to the benchtop bioreactor at 
the required flow rate to achieve the calculated hydraulic residence 
time of wastewater in the aeration tank.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.555

Where:

Q<INF>test</INF> = wastewater flow rate (L/min)
Q<INF>fs</INF> = average flow rate of full-scale process (L/min)
V<INF>fs</INF> = volume of full-scale aeration tank (L)

    8.1.2.2 The target flow rate in the test apparatus is the same as 
the flow rate in the target full-scale process multiplied by the ratio 
of benchtop bioreactor volume (e.g., 6 L) to the volume of the full-
scale aeration tank. The hydraulic residence time shall be maintained at 
90 to 100 percent of the residence time maintained in the target full-
scale unit. A nominal flow rate is set on the pump based on a pump 
calibration. Changes in the elasticity of the tubing in the pump head 
and the accumulation of material in the tubing affect this calibration. 
The nominal pumping rate shall be changed as necessary based on 
volumetric flow measurements. Discharge the benchtop bioreactor effluent 
to a wastewater storage, treatment, or disposal facility, except during 
sampling or flow measurement periods.
    8.1.3 Sludge Recycle Rate. Set the sludge recycle rate at a rate 
sufficient to prevent accumulation in the bottom of the clarifier. Set 
the air circulation rate sufficient to maintain the biomass in 
suspension.
    8.1.4 Benchtop Bioreactor Operation and Maintenance. Temperature, 
dissolved oxygen concentration, flow rate, and air circulation rate 
shall be measured and recorded three times throughout each day of 
testing. If other parameters (such as pH) are measured and maintained in 
the target full-scale unit, these parameters shall, where appropriate, 
be monitored and maintained to full-scale specifications in the benchtop 
bioreactor. At the beginning of each sampling period (section 8.2), 
sample the benchtop bioreactor contents for suspended solids analysis. 
Take this sample by loosening a clamp on a length of tubing attached to 
the lower side port. Determine the suspended solids gravimetrically by 
the Gooch crucible/glass fiber filter method for total suspended solids, 
in accordance with Standard Methods \3\ or equivalent. When necessary, 
sludge shall be wasted from the lower side port of the benchtop 
bioreactor, and the volume that is wasted shall be replaced with an 
equal volume of the benchtop bioreactor effluent. Add thickened 
activated sludge mixed liquor as necessary to the benchtop bioreactor to 
increase the suspended solids concentration to the desired level. Pump 
this mixed liquor to the benchtop bioreactor through the upper side port 
(Item 24 in Figure 304B-1). Change the membrane on the dissolved oxygen 
probe before starting the test. Calibrate the oxygen probe immediately 
before the start of the test and each time the membrane is changed.

[[Page 354]]

The scrubber solution shall be replaced each weekday with 175 mL 45 
percent W/W KOH solution to which five drops of 0.2 percent alizarin 
yellow indicator in water have been added. The potassium hydroxide 
solution in the alkaline scrubber shall be changed if the alizarin 
yellow dye color changes.
    8.1.5 Inspection and Correction Procedures. If the feed line tubing 
becomes clogged, replace with new tubing. If the feed flow rate is not 
within 5 percent of target flow any time the flow rate is measured, 
reset pump or check the flow measuring device and measure flow rate 
again until target flow rate is achieved.
    8.2 Test Sampling. At least two and one half hydraulic residence 
times after the system has reached the targeted specifications shall be 
permitted to elapse before the first sample is taken. Effluent samples 
of the clarifier discharge (Item 20 in Figure 304B-1) and the influent 
wastewater feed are collected in 40-mL septum vials to which two drops 
of 1:10 hydrochloric acid (HCl) in water have been added. Sample the 
clarifier discharge directly from the drain line. These samples will be 
composed of the entire flow from the system for a period of several 
minutes. Feed samples shall be taken from the feed pump suction line 
after temporarily stopping the benchtop bioreactor feed, removing a 
connector, and squeezing the collapsible feed container. Store both 
influent and effluent samples at 4 [deg]C immediately after collection 
and analyze within 8 hours of collection.
    8.2.1 Frequency of Sampling. During the test, sample and analyze the 
wastewater feed and the clarifier effluent at least six times. The 
sampling intervals shall be separated by at least 8 hours. During any 
individual sampling interval, sample the wastewater feed simultaneously 
with or immediately after the effluent sample. Calculate the RSD of the 
amount removed (i.e., effluent concentration--wastewater feed 
concentration). The RSD values shall be <15 percent. If an RSD value is 
<ls-thn-eq>15 percent, continue sampling and analyzing influent and 
effluent sets of samples until the RSD values are within specifications.
    8.2.2 Sampling After Exposure of System to Atmosphere. If, after 
starting sampling procedures, the benchtop bioreactor system is exposed 
to the atmosphere (due to leaks, maintenance, etc.), allow at least one 
hydraulic residence time to elapse before resuming sampling.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 Dissolved Oxygen. Fluctuation in dissolved oxygen concentration 
may occur for numerous reasons, including undetected gas leaks, 
increases and decreases in mixed liquor suspended solids resulting from 
cell growth and solids loss in the effluent stream, changes in diffuser 
performance, cycling of effluent flow rate, and overcorrection due to 
faulty or sluggish dissolved oxygen probe response. Control the 
dissolved oxygen concentration in the benchtop bioreactor by changing 
the proportion of oxygen in the circulating aeration gas. Should the 
dissolved oxygen concentration drift below the designated experimental 
condition, bleed a small amount of aeration gas from the system on the 
pressure side (i.e., immediately upstream of one of the diffusers). This 
will create a vacuum in the system, triggering the pressure sensitive 
relay to open the solenoid valve and admit oxygen to the system. Should 
the dissolved oxygen concentration drift above the designated 
experimental condition, slow or stop the oxygen input to the system 
until the dissolved oxygen concentration approaches the correct level.
    9.2 Sludge Wasting.
    9.2.1 Determine the suspended solids concentration (section 8.1.4) 
at the beginning of a test, and once per day thereafter during the test. 
If the test is completed within a two day period, determine the 
suspended solids concentration after the final sample set is taken. If 
the suspended solids concentration exceeds the specified concentration, 
remove a fraction of the sludge from the benchtop bioreactor. The 
required volume of mixed liquor to remove is determined as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.556

Where:

V<INF>w</INF> is the wasted volume (Liters),
V<INF>r</INF> is the volume of the benchtop bioreactor (Liters),
S<INF>m</INF> is the measured solids (g/L), and
S<INF>s</INF> is the specified solids (g/L).

    9.2.2 Remove the mixed liquor from the benchtop bioreactor by 
loosening a clamp on the mixed liquor sampling tube and allowing the 
required volume to drain to a graduated flask. Clamp the tube when the 
correct volume has been wasted. Replace the volume of

[[Page 355]]

the liquid wasted by pouring the same volume of effluent back into the 
benchtop bioreactor. Dispose of the waste sludge properly.
    9.3 Sludge Makeup. In the event that the suspended solids 
concentration is lower than the specifications, add makeup sludge back 
into the benchtop bioreactor. Determine the amount of sludge added by 
the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.557

Where:

V<INF>w</INF> is the volume of sludge to add (Liters),
V<INF>r</INF> is the volume of the benchtop bioreactor (Liters),
S<INF>w</INF> is the solids in the makeup sludge (g/L),
S<INF>m</INF> is the measured solids (g/L), and
S<INF>s</INF> is the specified solids (g/L).

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardizations

    10.1 Wastewater Pump Calibration. Determine the wastewater flow rate 
by collecting the system effluent for a time period of at least one 
hour, and measuring the volume with a graduated cylinder. Record the 
collection time period and volume collected. Determine flow rate. Adjust 
the pump speed to deliver the specified flow rate.
    10.2 Calibration Standards. Prepare calibration standards from pure 
certified standards in an aqueous medium. Prepare and analyze three 
concentrations of calibration standards for each target component (or 
for a mixture of components) in triplicate daily throughout the analyses 
of the test samples. At each concentration level, a single calibration 
shall be within 5 percent of the average of the three calibration 
results. The low and medium calibration standards shall bracket the 
expected concentration of the effluent (treated) wastewater. The medium 
and high standards shall bracket the expected influent concentration.

                     11.0 Analytical Test Procedures

    11.1 Analysis. If the identity of the compounds of interest in the 
wastewater is not known, a representative sample of the wastewater shall 
be analyzed in order to identify all of the compounds of interest 
present. A gas chromatography/mass spectrometry screening method is 
recommended.
    11.1.1 After identifying the compounds of interest in the 
wastewater, develop and/or use one or more analytical technique capable 
of measuring each of those compounds (more than one analytical technique 
may be required, depending on the characteristics of the wastewater). 
Method 18, found in appendix A of 40 CFR 60, may be used as a guideline 
in developing the analytical technique. Purge and trap techniques may be 
used for analysis providing the target components are sufficiently 
volatile to make this technique appropriate. The limit of quantitation 
for each compound shall be determined.\1\ If the effluent concentration 
of any target compound is below the limit of quantitation determined for 
that compound, the operation of the Method 304 unit may be altered to 
attempt to increase the effluent concentration above the limit of 
quantitation. Modifications to the method shall be approved prior to the 
test. The request should be addressed to Method 304 contact, Emissions 
Measurement Center, Mail Drop 19, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 The heated purge conditions established by Method 25D (40 CFR 
Part 60, Appendix A) are used to remove VOs from a 10 gram sample of 
waste suspended in a 50/50 solution of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and 
water. The purged VOs are quantified by using the sample collection and 
analytical techniques (e.g. gas chromatography) appropriate for the VOs 
present in the waste. The recovery efficiency of the sample collection 
and analytical technique is determined for each waste matrix. A 
correction factor is determined for each compound (if acceptable 
recovery criteria requirements are met of 70 to 130 percent recovery for 
every target compound), and the measured waste concentration is 
corrected with the correction factor for each compound. A minimum of 
three replicate waste samples shall be analyzed.

    5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, 
operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the 
safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the 
user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health 
practices and to determine the applicability of regulatory limitations 
prior to performing this test method.

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

    6.1 Method 25D Purge Apparatus.
    6.1.1 Purge Chamber. The purge chamber shall accommodate the 10 gram 
sample of waste suspended in a matrix of 50 mL of PEG and 50 mL of 
deionized, hydrocarbon-free water. Three fittings are used on the glass 
chamber top. Two <greek-i>7 Ace-threads are used for the purge gas inlet 
and outlet connections. A <greek-i>50 Ace-thread is used to connect the 
top of the chamber to the base (see Figure 305-1). The base of the 
chamber has a side-arm equipped with a <greek-i>22 Sovirel fitting to 
allow for easy sample introductions into the chamber. The dimensions of 
the chamber are shown in Figure 305-1.
    6.1.2 Flow Distribution Device (FDD). The FDD enhances the gas-to-
liquid contact for improved purging efficiency. The FDD is a 6 mm OD 
(0.2 in) by 30 cm (12 in) long glass tube equipped with four arm 
bubblers as shown in Figure 305-1. Each arm shall have an opening of 1 
mm (0.04 in) in diameter.
    6.1.3 Coalescing Filter. The coalescing filter serves to discourage 
aerosol formation of sample gas once it leaves the purge chamber. The 
glass filter has a fritted disc mounted 10 cm (3.9 in) from the bottom. 
Two <greek-i>7 Ace-threads are used for the inlet and outlet 
connections. The dimensions of the chamber are shown in Figure 305-2.
    6.1.4 Oven. A forced convection airflow oven capable of maintaining 
the purge chamber and coalescing filter at 75 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 
[deg]C (167 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3.6 [deg]F).
    6.1.5 Toggle Valve. An on/off valve constructed from brass or 
stainless steel rated to 100 psig. This valve is placed in line between 
the purge nitrogen source and the flow controller.
    6.1.6 Flow Controller. High-quality stainless steel flow controller 
capable of restricting a flow of nitrogen to 6 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.06 L/min (0.2 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.002 ft\3\/min) 
at 40 psig.
    6.1.7 Polyethylene Glycol Cleaning System.
    6.1.7.1 Round-Bottom Flask. One liter, three-neck glass round-bottom 
flask for cleaning PEG. Standard taper 24/40 joints are mounted on each 
neck.
    6.1.7.2 Heating Mantle. Capable of heating contents of the 1-L flask 
to 120 [deg]C (248 [deg]F).
    6.1.7.3 Nitrogen Bubbler. Teflon <SUP>[reg]</SUP> or glass tube, 
0.25 in OD (6.35 mm).
    6.1.7.4 Temperature Sensor. Partial immersion glass thermometer.
    6.1.7.5 Hose Adapter. Glass with 24/40 standard tapered joint.
    6.2 Volatile Organic Recovery System.
    6.2.1 Splitter Valve (Optional). Stainless steel cross-pattern valve 
capable of splitting nominal flow rates from the purge flow of 6 L/min 
(0.2 ft\3\/min). The valve shall be maintained at 75 + 2 [deg]C (167 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3.6 [deg]F) in the heated zone and shall be placed 
downstream of the coalescing filter. It is recommended that 0.125 in OD 
(3.175 mm) tubing be used to direct the split vent flow from the heated 
zone. The back pressure caused by the 0.125 in OD (3.175 mm) tubing is 
critical for maintaining proper split valve operation.
    Note: The splitter valve design is optional; it may be used in cases 
where the concentration of a pollutant would saturate the adsorbents.
    6.2.2 Injection Port. Stainless steel 1/4 in OD (6.35 mm) 
compression fitting tee with a 6 mm (0.2 in) septum fixed on the top 
port. The injection port is the point of entry for the recovery study 
solution. If using a gaseous standard to determine recovery efficiency, 
connect the gaseous standard to the injection port of the tee.
    6.2.3 Knockout Trap (Optional but Recommended). A 25 mL capacity 
glass reservoir body with a full-stem impinger (to avoid leaks, a 
modified midget glass impinger with a screw cap and ball/socket clamps 
on the inlet and outlet is recommended). The empty

[[Page 359]]

impinger is placed in an ice water bath between the injection port and 
the sorbent cartridge. Its purpose is to reduce the water content of the 
purge gas (saturated at 75 [deg]C (167 [deg]F)) before the sorbent 
cartridge.
    6.2.4 Insulated Ice Bath. A 350 mL dewar or other type of insulated 
bath is used to maintain ice water around the knockout trap.
    6.2.5 Sorbent Cartridges. Commercially available glass or stainless 
steel cartridge packed with one or more appropriate sorbents. The amount 
of adsorbent packed in the cartridge depends on the breakthrough volume 
of the test compounds but is limited by back pressure caused by the 
packing (not to exceed 7 psig). More than one sorbent cartridge placed 
in series may be necessary depending upon the mixture of the measured 
components.
    6.2.6 Volumetric Glassware. Type A glass 10 mL volumetric flasks for 
measuring a final volume from the water catch in the knockout trap.
    6.2.7 Thermal Desorption Unit. A clam-shell type oven, used for the 
desorption of direct thermal desorption sorbent tubes. The oven shall be 
capable of increasing the temperature of the desorption tubes rapidly to 
recommended desorption temperature.
    6.2.8 Ultrasonic Bath. Small bath used to agitate sorbent material 
and desorption solvent. Ice water shall be used in the bath because of 
heat transfer caused by operation of the bath.
    6.2.9 Desorption Vials. Four-dram (15 mL) capacity borosilicate 
glass vials with Teflon-lined caps.
    6.3 Analytical System. A gas chromatograph (GC) is commonly used to 
separate and quantify compounds from the sample collection and recovery 
procedure. Method 18 (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A) may be used as a 
guideline for determining the appropriate GC column and GC detector 
based on the test compounds to be determined. Other types of analytical 
instrumentation may be used (HPLC) in lieu of GC systems as long as the 
recovery efficiency criteria of this method are met.
    6.3.1 Gas Chromatograph (GC). The GC shall be equipped with a 
constant-temperature liquid injection port or a heated sampling loop/
valve system, as appropriate. The GC oven shall be temperature-
programmable over the useful range of the GC column. The choice of 
detectors is based on the test compounds to be determined.
    6.3.2 GC Column. Select the appropriate GC column based on (1) 
literature review or previous experience, (2) polarity of the analytes, 
(3) capacity of the column, or (4) resolving power (e.g., length, 
diameter, film thickness) required.
    6.3.3 Data System. A programmable electronic integrator for 
recording, analyzing, and storing the signal generated by the detector.

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards

    7.1 Method 25D Purge Apparatus.
    7.1.1 Polyethylene Glycol (PEG). Ninety-eight percent pure organic 
polymer with an average molecular weight of 400 g/mol. Volatile organics 
are removed from the PEG prior to use by heating to 120 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]C (248 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>9 [deg]F) and 
purging with pure nitrogen at 1 L/min (0.04 ft\3\/min) for 2 hours. 
After purging and heating, the PEG is maintained at room temperature 
under a nitrogen purge maintained at 1 L/min (0.04 ft\3\/min) until 
used. A typical apparatus used to clean the PEG is shown in Figure 305-
3.
    7.1.2 Water. Organic-free deionized water is required.
    7.1.3 Nitrogen. High-purity nitrogen (less than 0.5 ppm total 
hydrocarbons) is used to remove test compounds from the purge matrix. 
The source of nitrogen shall be regulated continuously to 40 psig before 
the on/off toggle valve.
    7.2 Volatile Organic Recovery System.
    7.2.1 Water. Organic-free deionized water is required.
    7.2.2 Desorption Solvent (when used). Appropriate high-purity (99.99 
percent) solvent for desorption shall be used. Analysis shall be 
performed (utilizing the same analytical technique as that used in the 
analysis of the waste samples) on each lot to determine purity.
    7.3 Analytical System. The gases required for GC operation shall be 
of the highest obtainable purity (hydrocarbon free). Consult the 
operating manual for recommended settings.

       8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport

    8.1 Assemble the glassware and associated fittings (see Figures 305-
3 and 305-4, as appropriate) and leak-check the system (approximately 7 
psig is the target pressure). After an initial leak check, mark the 
pressure gauge and use the initial checkpoint to monitor for leaks 
throughout subsequent analyses. If the pressure in the system drops 
below the target pressure at any time during analysis, that analysis 
shall be considered invalid.
    8.2 Recovery Efficiency Determination. Determine the individual 
recovery efficiency (RE) for each of the target compounds in duplicate 
before the waste samples are analyzed. To determine the RE, generate a 
water blank (Section 11.1) and use the injection port to introduce a 
known volume of spike solution (or certified gaseous standard) 
containing all of the target compounds at the levels expected in the 
waste sample. Introduce the spike solution immediately after the 
nitrogen purge has been started (Section

[[Page 360]]

8.3.2). Follow the procedures outlined in Section 8.3.3. Analyze the 
recovery efficiency samples using the techniques described in Section 
11.2. Determine the recovery efficiency (Equation 305-1, Section 12.2) 
by comparing the amount of compound recovered to the theoretical amount 
spiked. Determine the RE twice for each compound; the relative standard 
deviation, (RSD) shall be <=10 percent for each compound. If the RSD for 
any compound is not <= 10 percent, modify the sampling/analytical 
procedure and complete an RE study in duplicate, or continue determining 
RE until the RSD meets the acceptable criteria. The average RE shall be 
0.70 <= RE <= 1.30 for each compound. If the average RE does not meet 
these criteria, an alternative sample collection and/or analysis 
technique shall be developed and the recovery efficiency determination 
shall be repeated for that compound until the criteria are met for every 
target compound. Example modifications of the sampling/analytical system 
include changing the adsorbent material, changing the desorption 
solvent, utilizing direct thermal desorption of test compounds from the 
sorbent tubes, utilizing another analytical technique.
    8.3 Sample Collection and Recovery.
    8.3.1 The sample collection procedure in Method 25D shall be used to 
collect (into a preweighed vial) 10 g of waste into PEG, cool, and ship 
to the laboratory. Remove the sample container from the cooler and wipe 
the exterior to remove any ice or water. Weigh the container and sample 
to the nearest 0.01 g and record the weight. Pour the sample from the 
container into the purge flask. Rinse the sample container three times 
with approximately 6 mL of PEG (or the volume needed to total 50 mL of 
PEG in the purge flask), transferring the rinses to the purge flask. Add 
50 mL of organic-free deionized water to the purge flask. Cap the purge 
flask tightly in between each rinse and after adding all the components 
into the flask.
    8.3.2 Allow the oven to equilibrate to 75 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 
[deg]C (167 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3.6 [deg]F). Begin the sample recovery 
process by turning the toggle valve on, thus allowing a 6 L/min flow of 
pure nitrogen through the purge chamber.
    8.3.3 Stop the purge after 30 min. Immediately remove the sorbent 
tube(s) from the apparatus and cap both ends. Remove the knockout trap 
and transfer the water catch to a 10 mL volumetric flask. Rinse the trap 
with organic-free deionized water and transfer the rinse to the 
volumetric flask. Dilute to the 10 mL mark with water. Transfer the 
water sample to a sample vial and store at 4 [deg]C (39.2 [deg]F) with 
zero headspace. The analysis of the contents of the water knockout trap 
is optional for this method. If the target compounds are water soluble, 
analysis of the water is recommended; meeting the recovery efficiency 
criteria in these cases would be difficult without adding the amount 
captured in the knockout trap.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    10.1 The analytical instrument shall be calibrated with a minimum of 
three levels of standards for each compound whose concentrations bracket 
the concentration of test compounds from the sorbent tubes. Liquid 
calibration standards shall be used for calibration in the analysis of 
the solvent extracts. The liquid calibration standards shall be prepared 
in the desorption solvent matrix. The calibration standards may be 
prepared and injected individually or as a mixture. If thermal 
desorption and focusing (onto another sorbent or cryogen focusing) are 
used, a certified gaseous mixture or a series of gaseous standards shall 
be used for calibration of the instrument. The gaseous standards shall 
be focused and analyzed in the same manner as the samples.
    10.2 The analytical system shall be certified free from contaminants 
before a calibration is performed (see Section 11.1). The calibration 
standards are used to determine the linearity of the analytical system. 
Perform an initial calibration and linearity check by analyzing the 
three calibration standards for each target compound in triplicate 
starting with the lowest level and continuing to the highest level. If 
the triplicate analyses do not agree within 5 percent of their average, 
additional analyses will be needed until the 5 percent criteria is met. 
Calculate the response factor (Equation 305-3, Section 12.4) from the 
average area counts of the injections for each concentration level. 
Average the response factors of the standards for each compound. The 
linearity of the detector is acceptable if the response

[[Page 361]]

factor of each compound at a particular concentration is within 10 
percent of the overall mean response factor for that compound. Analyze 
daily a mid-level calibration standard in duplicate and calculate a new 
response factor. Compare the daily response factor average to the 
average response factor calculated for the mid-level calibration during 
the initial linearity check; repeat the three-level calibration 
procedure if the daily average response factor differs from the initial 
linearity check mid-level response factor by more than 10 percent. 
Otherwise, proceed with the sample analysis.

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    11.1 Water Blank Analysis. A water blank shall be analyzed daily to 
determine the cleanliness of the purge and recovery system. A water 
blank is generated by adding 60 mL of organic-free deionized water to 50 
mL of PEG in the purge chamber. Treat the blank as described in Sections 
8.3.2 and 8.3.3. The purpose of the water blank is to insure that no 
contaminants exist in the sampling and analytical apparatus which would 
interfere with the quantitation of the target compounds. If contaminants 
are present, locate the source of contamination, remove it, and repeat 
the water blank analysis.
    11.2 Sample Analysis. Sample analysis in the context of this method 
refers to techniques to remove the target compounds from the sorbent 
tubes, separate them using a chromatography technique, and quantify them 
with an appropriate detector. Two types of sample extraction techniques 
typically used for sorbents include solvent desorption or direct thermal 
desorption of test compounds to a secondary focusing unit (either 
sorbent or cryogen based). The test compounds are then typically 
transferred to a GC system for analysis. Other analytical systems may be 
used (e.g., HPLC) in lieu of GC systems as long as the recovery 
efficiency criteria of this method are met.
    11.2.1 Recover the test compounds from the sorbent tubes that 
require solvent desorption by transferring the adsorbent material to a 
sample vial containing the desorption solvent. The desorption solvent 
shall be the same as the solvent used to prepare calibration standards. 
The volume of solvent depends on the amount of adsorbed material to be 
desorbed (1.0 mL per 100 mg of adsorbent material) and also on the 
amount of test compounds present. Final volume adjustment and or 
dilution can be made so that the concentration of test compounds in the 
desorption solvent is bracketed by the concentration of the calibration 
solutions. Ultrasonicate the desorption solvent for 15 min in an ice 
bath. Allow the sample to sit for a period of time so that the adsorbent 
material can settle to the bottom of the vial. Transfer the solvent with 
a pasteur pipet (minimizing the amount of adsorbent material taken) to 
another vial and store at 4 [deg]C (39.2 [deg]F).
    11.2.2 Analyze the desorption solvent or direct thermal desorption 
tubes from each sample using the same analytical parameters used for the 
calibration standard. Calculate the total weight detected for each 
compound (Equation 305-4, Section 12.5). The slope (area/amount) and y-
intercept are calculated from the line bracketed between the two closest 
calibration points. Correct the concentration of each waste sample with 
the appropriate recovery efficiency factor and the split flow ratio (if 
used). The final concentration of each individual test compound is 
calculated by dividing the corrected measured weight for that compound 
by the weight of the original sample determined in Section 8.3.1 
(Equation 305-5, Section 12.6).
    11.2.3 Repeat the analysis for the three samples collected in 
Section 8.3. Report the corrected concentration of each of the waste 
samples, average waste concentration, and relative standard deviation 
(Equation 305-6, Section 12.7).

Method 306--Determination of Chromium Emissions From Decorative and Hard 
 Chromium Electroplating and Chromium Anodizing Operations--Isokinetic 
                                 Method

    Note: This method does not include all of the specifications (e.g., 
equipment and supplies) and procedures (e.g., sampling and analytical) 
essential to its performance. Some material is incorporated by reference 
from other methods in 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A. Therefore, to obtain 
reliable results, persons using this method should have a thorough 
knowledge of at least Method 5.

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 Analytes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Analyte                  CAS No.            Sensitivity
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chromium......................  7440-47-3........  See Sec. 13.2.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1.2 Applicability. This method applies to the determination of 
chromium (Cr) in emissions from decorative and hard chrome 
electroplating facilities, chromium anodizing operations, and continuous 
chromium plating operations at iron and steel facilities.
    1.3 Data Quality Objectives. [Reserved]

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 Sampling. An emission sample is extracted isokinetically from 
the source using an unheated Method 5 sampling train (40 CFR Part 60, 
Appendix A), with a glass nozzle and probe liner, but with the filter 
omitted. The sample time shall be at least two hours. The Cr emissions 
are collected in an alkaline solution containing 0.1 N sodium hydroxide 
(NaOH) or 0.1 N sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<INF>3</INF>). The collected 
samples are recovered using an alkaline solution and are then 
transported to the laboratory for analysis.
    2.2 Analysis.
    2.2.1 Total chromium samples with high chromium concentrations 
(<ls-thn-eq>=35 [micro]g/L) may be analyzed using inductively coupled 
plasma emission spectrometry (ICP) at 267.72 nm.
    Note: The ICP analysis is applicable for this method only when the 
solution analyzed has a Cr concentration greater than or equal to 35 
[micro]g/L or five times the method detection limit as determined 
according to Appendix B in 40 CFR Part 136.

[[Page 367]]

    2.2.2 Alternatively, when lower total chromium concentrations (<35 
[micro]g/L) are encountered, a portion of the alkaline sample solution 
may be digested with nitric acid and analyzed by graphite furnace atomic 
absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) at 357.9 nm.
    2.2.3 If it is desirable to determine hexavalent chromium 
(Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>) emissions, the samples may be analyzed using an ion 
chromatograph equipped with a post-column reactor (IC/PCR) and a visible 
wavelength detector. To increase sensitivity for trace levels of 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>, a preconcentration system may be used in conjunction 
with the IC/PCR.

                             3.0 Definitions

    3.1 Total Chromium--measured chromium content that includes both 
major chromium oxidation states (Cr<SUP>+3</SUP>, Cr<SUP>+3</SUP>).
    3.2 May--Implies an optional operation.
    3.3 Digestion--The analytical operation involving the complete (or 
nearly complete) dissolution of the sample in order to ensure the 
complete solubilization of the element (analyte) to be measured.
    3.4 Interferences--Physical, chemical, or spectral phenomena that 
may produce a high or low bias in the analytical result.
    3.5 Analytical System--All components of the analytical process 
including the sample digestion and measurement apparatus.
    3.6 Sample Recovery--The quantitative transfer of sample from the 
collection apparatus to the sample preparation (digestion, etc.) 
apparatus. This term should not be confused with analytical recovery.
    3.7 Matrix Modifier--A chemical modification to the sample during 
GFAAS determinations to ensure that the analyte is not lost during the 
measurement process (prior to the atomization stage)
    3.8 Calibration Reference Standards--Quality control standards used 
to check the accuracy of the instrument calibration curve prior to 
sample analysis.
    3.9 Continuing Check Standard--Quality control standards used to 
verify that unacceptable drift in the measurement system has not 
occurred.
    3.10 Calibration Blank--A blank used to verify that there has been 
no unacceptable shift in the baseline either immediately following 
calibration or during the course of the analytical measurement.
    3.11 Interference Check--An analytical/measurement operation that 
ascertains whether a measurable interference in the sample exists.
    3.12 Interelement Correction Factors--Factors used to correct for 
interfering elements that produce a false signal (high bias).
    3.13 Duplicate Sample Analysis--Either the repeat measurement of a 
single solution or the measurement of duplicate preparations of the same 
sample. It is important to be aware of which approach is required for a 
particular type of measurement. For example, no digestion is required 
for the ICP determination and the duplicate instrument measurement is 
therefore adequate whereas duplicate digestion/instrument measurements 
are required for GFAAS.
    3.14 Matrix Spiking--Analytical spikes that have been added to the 
actual sample matrix either before (Section 9.2.5.2) or after (Section 
9.1.6). Spikes added to the sample prior to a preparation technique 
(e.g., digestion) allow for the assessment of an overall method accuracy 
while those added after only provide for the measurement accuracy 
determination.

                            4.0 Interferences

    4.1 ICP Interferences.
    4.1.1 ICP Spectral Interferences. Spectral interferences are caused 
by: overlap of a spectral line from another element; unresolved overlap 
of molecular band spectra; background contribution from continuous or 
recombination phenomena; and, stray light from the line emission of 
high-concentrated elements. Spectral overlap may be compensated for by 
correcting the raw data with a computer and measuring the interfering 
element. At the 267.72 nm Cr analytical wavelength, iron, manganese, and 
uranium are potential interfering elements. Background and stray light 
interferences can usually be compensated for by a background correction 
adjacent to the analytical line. Unresolved overlap requires the 
selection of an alternative chromium wavelength. Consult the instrument 
manufacturer's operation manual for interference correction procedures.
    4.1.2 ICP Physical Interferences. High levels of dissolved solids in 
the samples may cause significant inaccuracies due to salt buildup at 
the nebulizer and torch tips. This problem can be controlled by diluting 
the sample or by extending the rinse times between sample analyses. 
Standards shall be prepared in the same solution matrix as the samples 
(i.e., 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF>).
    4.1.3 ICP Chemical Interferences. These include molecular compound 
formation, ionization effects and solute vaporization effects, and are 
usually not significant in the ICP procedure, especially if the 
standards and samples are matrix matched.
    4.2 GFAAS Interferences.
    4.2.1 GFAAS Chemical Interferences. Low concentrations of calcium 
and/or phosphate may cause interferences; at concentrations above 200 
[micro]g/L, calcium's effect is constant and eliminates the effect of 
phosphate. Calcium nitrate is therefore added to the concentrated 
analyte to ensure a known constant effect. Other matrix modifiers 
recommended by the instrument manufacturer may also be considered.
    4.2.2 GFAAS Cyanide Band Interferences. Nitrogen should not be used 
as the purge gas due to cyanide band interference.

[[Page 368]]

    4.2.3 GFAAS Spectral Interferences. Background correction may be 
required because of possible significant levels of nonspecific 
absorption and scattering at the 357.9 nm analytical wavelength.
    4.2.4 GFAAS Background Interferences. Zeeman or Smith-Hieftje 
background correction is recommended for interferences resulting from 
high levels of dissolved solids in the alkaline impinger solutions.
    4.3 IC/PCR Interferences.
    4.3.1 IC/PCR Chemical Interferences. Components in the sample matrix 
may cause Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> to convert to trivalent chromium 
(Cr<SUP>+3</SUP>) or cause Cr<SUP>+3</SUP> to convert to 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>. The chromatographic separation of Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> using 
ion chromatography reduces the potential for other metals to interfere 
with the post column reaction. For the IC/PCR analysis, only compounds 
that coelute with Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> and affect the diphenylcarbazide 
reaction will cause interference.
    4.3.2 IC/PCR Background Interferences. Periodic analyses of reagent 
water blanks are used to demonstrate that the analytical system is 
essentially free of contamination. Sample cross-contamination can occur 
when high-level and low-level samples or standards are analyzed 
alternately and can be eliminated by thorough purging of the sample 
loop. Purging of the sample can easily be achieved by increasing the 
injection volume to ten times the size of the sample loop.

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, 
operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the 
safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the 
user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to 
determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to 
performing this test method.
    5.2 Hexavalent chromium compounds have been listed as carcinogens 
although chromium (III) compounds show little or no toxicity. Chromium 
can be a skin and respiratory irritant.

    8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Holding Times, Storage, and 
                                Transport

    Note: Prior to sample collection, consideration should be given to 
the type of analysis (Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> or total Cr) that will be 
performed. Which analysis option(s) will be performed will determine 
which sample recovery and storage procedures will be required to process 
the sample (See Figures 306-3 and 306-4).
    8.1 Sample Collection. Same as Method 5 (40 CFR part 60, Appendix 
A), with the following exceptions.
    8.1.1 Omit the particulate filter and filter holder from the 
sampling train. Use a glass nozzle and probe liner instead of stainless 
steel. Do not heat the probe. Place 100 mL of 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N 
NaHCO<INF>3</INF> in each of the first two impingers, and record the 
data for each run on a data sheet such as shown in Figure 306-2.

three times with tap water, followed by three additional rinses with 
reagent water. Then soak the glassware in 10% (v/v) HNO<INF>3</INF> 
solution for a minimum of 4 hours, rinse three times with reagent water, 
and allow to air dry. Cover all glassware openings where contamination 
can occur with Parafilm, or equivalent, until the sampling train is 
assembled for sampling.
    8.1.3 Train Operation. Follow the basic procedures outlined in 
Method 5 in conjunction with the following instructions. Train sampling 
rate shall not exceed 0.030 m\3\/min (1.0 cfm) during a run.
    8.2 Sample Recovery. Follow the basic procedures of Method 5, with 
the exceptions noted.
    8.2.1 A particulate filter is not recovered from this train.
    8.2.2 Tester shall select either the total Cr or Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> 
sample recovery option.
    8.2.3 Samples to be analyzed for both total Cr and Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>,

8.2.6).
    8.2.4 A field reagent blank shall be collected for either of the Cr 
or the Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> analysis. If both analyses (Cr and 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>) are to be conducted on the samples, collect separate 
reagent blanks for each analysis.
    Note: Since particulate matter is not usually present at chromium 
electroplating and/or chromium anodizing operations, it is not necessary 
to filter the Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> samples unless there is observed sediment 
in the collected solutions. If it is necessary to filter the 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> solutions, please refer to Method 0061, Determination of 
Hexavalent Chromium Emissions From Stationary Sources, Section 7.4, 
Sample Preparation in SW-846 (see Reference 1).

first, second, and third impingers and quantitatively transfer into a 
labeled sample container.
    8.2.5.2 Use approximately 200 to 300 mL of the 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N 
NaHCO<INF>3</INF> absorbing solution to rinse the probe nozzle, probe 
liner, three impingers, and connecting glassware; add this rinse to 
Container No. 1.
    8.2.6 Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> Sample Option.
    8.2.6.1 Container No. 1. Measure and record the pH of the absorbing 
solution contained in the first impinger at the end of the sampling run 
using a pH indicator strip. The pH of the solution must be 
<ls-thn-eq>=8.5 for NaOH and <ls-thn-eq>=8.0 for NaHCO<INF>3</INF>. If 
it is not, discard the collected sample, increase the normality of the 
NaOH or NaHCO<INF>3</INF> impinger absorbing solution to 0.5 N or to a 
solution normality approved by the Administrator and collect another air 
emission sample.
    8.2.6.2 After determining the pH of the first impinger solution, 
combine and measure the volume of the liquid in the first, second, and 
third impingers and quantitatively transfer into the labeled sample 
container.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 ICP Quality Control.
    9.1.1 ICP Calibration Reference Standards. Prepare a calibration 
reference standard using the same alkaline matrix as the calibration 
standards; it should be at least 10 times the instrumental detection 
limit.
    9.1.1.1 This reference standard must be prepared from a different Cr 
stock solution source than that used for preparation of the calibration 
curve standards.
    9.1.1.2 Prior to sample analysis, analyze at least one reference 
standard.
    9.1.1.3 The calibration reference standard must be measured within 
10 percent of it's true value for the curve to be considered valid.
    9.1.1.4 The curve must be validated before sample analyses are 
performed.
    9.1.2 ICP Continuing Check Standard.
    9.1.2.1 Perform analysis of the check standard with the field 
samples as described in Section 11.2 (at least after every 10 samples, 
and at the end of the analytical run).
    9.1.2.2 The check standard can either be the mid-range calibration 
standard or the reference standard. The results of the check standard 
shall agree within 10 percent of the expected value; if not, terminate 
the analyses, correct the problem, recalibrate the instrument, and rerun 
all samples analyzed subsequent to the last acceptable check standard 
analysis.
    9.1.3 ICP Calibration Blank.
    9.1.3.1 Perform analysis of the calibration blank with the field 
samples as described in Section 11.2 (at least after every 10 samples, 
and at the end of the analytical run).
    9.1.3.2 The results of the calibration blank shall agree within 
three standard deviations of the mean blank value. If not, analyze the 
calibration blank two more times and average the results. If the average 
is not within three standard deviations of the background mean, 
terminate the analyses, correct the problem, recalibrate, and reanalyze 
all samples analyzed subsequent to the last acceptable calibration blank 
analysis.
    9.1.4 ICP Interference Check. Prepare an interference check solution 
that contains known concentrations of interfering elements that will 
provide an adequate test of the correction factors in the event of 
potential spectral interferences.
    9.1.4.1 Two potential interferences, iron and manganese, may be 
prepared as 1000 [micro]g/mL and 200 [micro]g/mL solutions, 
respectively. The solutions should be prepared in dilute HNO<INF>3</INF> 
(1-5 percent). Particular care must be used to ensure that the solutions 
and/or salts used to prepare the solutions are of ICP grade purity 
(i.e., that no measurable Cr contamination exists in the salts/
solutions). Commercially prepared interfering element check standards 
are available.
    9.1.4.2 Verify the interelement correction factors every three 
months by analyzing the interference check solution. The correction 
factors are calculated according to the instrument manufacturer's 
directions. If the interelement correction factors are used properly, no 
false Cr should be detected.
    9.1.4.3 Negative results with an absolute value greater than three 
(3) times the detection limit are usually the results of the background 
correction position being set incorrectly. Scan the spectral region to 
ensure that the correction position has not been placed on an 
interfering peak.
    9.1.5 ICP Duplicate Sample Analysis. Perform one duplicate sample 
analysis for each compliance sample batch (3 runs).
    9.1.5.1 As there is no sample preparation required for the ICP 
analysis, a duplicate analysis is defined as a repeat analysis of one of 
the field samples. The selected sample shall be analyzed using the same 
procedures that were used to analyze the original sample.
    9.1.5.2 Duplicate sample analyses shall agree within 10 percent of 
the original measurement value.
    9.1.5.3 Report the original analysis value for the sample and report 
the duplicate analysis value as the QC check value. If agreement is not 
achieved, perform the duplicate analysis again. If agreement is not 
achieved the second time, perform corrective action to identify and 
correct the problem before analyzing the sample for a third time.
    9.1.6 ICP Matrix Spiking. Spiked samples shall be prepared and 
analyzed daily to ensure that there are no matrix effects, that samples 
and standards have been matrix-matched, and that the laboratory 
equipment is operating properly.

[[Page 372]]

    9.1.6.1 Spiked sample recovery analyses should indicate a recovery 
for the Cr spike of between 75 and 125 percent.
    9.1.6.2 Cr levels in the spiked sample should provide final solution 
concentrations that are within the linear portion of the calibration 
curve, as well as, at a concentration level at least: equal to that of 
the original sample; and, ten (10) times the detection limit.
    9.1.6.3 If the spiked sample concentration meets the stated criteria 
but exceeds the linear calibration range, the spiked sample must be 
diluted with the field absorbing solution.
    9.1.6.4 If the recoveries for the Cr spiked samples do not meet the 
specified criteria, perform corrective action to identify and correct 
the problem prior to reanalyzing the samples.
    9.1.7 ICP Field Reagent Blank.
    9.1.7.1 Analyze a minimum of one matrix-matched field reagent blank 
(Section 8.2.4) per sample batch to determine if contamination or memory 
effects are occurring.
    9.1.7.2 If contamination or memory effects are observed, perform 
corrective action to identify and correct the problem before reanalyzing 
the samples.
    9.1.8 Audit Sample Analysis.
    9.1.8.1 When the method is used to analyze samples to demonstrate 
compliance with a source emission regulation, an audit sample must be 
analyzed, subject to availability.

samples in the same manner to evaluate the technique of the analyst and 
the standards preparation.
    9.1.8.3 The same analyst, analytical reagents, and analytical system 
shall be used for the compliance samples and the audit sample. If this 
condition is met, duplicate auditing of subsequent compliance analyses 
for the same enforcement agency within a 30-day period is waived. An 
audit sample set may not be used to validate different sets of 
compliance samples under the jurisdiction of separate enforcement 
agencies, unless prior arrangements have been made with both enforcement 
agencies.

determination samples along with their identification numbers, and the 
analyst's name to the responsible enforcement authority. Include this 
information with reports of any subsequent compliance analyses for the 
same enforcement authority during the 30-day period.
    9.1.9.3 The concentrations of the audit samples obtained by the 
analyst shall agree within the values specified by the compliance 
auditor. If the specified range is not met, reanalyze the compliance and 
audit samples, and include initial and reanalysis values in the test 
report.
    9.1.9.4 Failure to meet the specified range may require retests 
unless the audit problems are resolved. However, if the audit results do 
not affect the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected 
facility, the Administrator may waive the reanalysis requirement, 
further audits, or retests and accept the results of the compliance 
test. While steps are being taken to resolve audit analysis problems,

                       11.0 Analytical Procedures

    Note: The method determines the chromium concentration in [micro]g 
Cr/mL. It is important that the analyst measure the field sample volume 
prior to analyzing the sample. This will allow for conversion of 
[micro]g Cr/mL to [micro]g Cr/sample.

    11.1 ICP Sample Preparation.
    11.1.1 The ICP analysis is performed directly on the alkaline 
impinger solution; acid digestion is not necessary, provided the samples 
and standards are matrix matched.
    11.1.2 The ICP analysis should only be employed when the solution 
analyzed has a Cr concentration greater than 35 [micro]g/L or five times 
the method detection limit as determined according to Appendix B in 40 
CFR Part 136 or by other commonly accepted analytical procedures.
    11.2 ICP Sample Analysis.
    11.2.1 The ICP analysis is applicable for the determination of total 
chromium only.

analysis.
    11.2.2.1 Calibration Blank. The calibration blank is used in 
establishing the calibration curve. For the calibration blank, use 
either 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF>, whichever is used for the 
impinger absorbing solution. The calibration blank can be prepared fresh 
in the laboratory; it does not have to be prepared from the same batch 
of solution that was used in the field. A sufficient quantity should be 
prepared to flush the system between standards and samples.
    11.2.2.2 Field Reagent Blank. The field reagent blank is collected 
in the field during the testing program. The field reagent blank 
(Section 8.2.4) is an aliquot of the absorbing solution prepared in 
Section 7.1.2. The reagent blank is used to assess possible 
contamination resulting from sample processing.
    11.2.3 ICP Instrument Adjustment.
    11.2.3.1 Adjust the ICP instrument for proper operating parameters 
including wavelength, background correction settings (if necessary), and 
interfering element correction settings (if necessary).
    11.2.3.2 The instrument must be allowed to become thermally stable 
before beginning measurements (usually requiring at least 30

[[Page 376]]

min of operation prior to calibration). During this warmup period, the 
optical calibration and torch position optimization may be performed 
(consult the operator's manual).
    11.2.4 ICP Instrument Calibration.
    11.2.4.1 Calibrate the instrument according to the instrument 
manufacturer's recommended procedures, and the procedures specified in 
Section 10.2.
    11.2.4.2 Prior to analyzing the field samples, reanalyze the highest 
calibration standard as if it were a sample.
    11.2.4.3 Concentration values obtained should not deviate from the 
actual values or from the established control limits by more than 5 
percent, whichever is lower (see Sections 9.1 and 10.2).
    11.2.4.4 If they do, follow the recommendations of the instrument 
manufacturer to correct the problem.
    11.2.5 ICP Operational Quality Control Procedures.
    11.2.5.1 Flush the system with the calibration blank solution for at 
least 1 min before the analysis of each sample or standard.
    11.2.5.2 Analyze the continuing check standard and the calibration 
blank after each batch of 10 samples.
    11.2.5.3 Use the average intensity of multiple exposures for both 
standardization and sample analysis to reduce random error.
    11.2.6 ICP Sample Dilution.
    11.2.6.1 Dilute and reanalyze samples that are more concentrated 
than the linear calibration limit or use an alternate, less sensitive Cr 
wavelength for which quality control data have already been established.
    11.2.6.2 When dilutions are performed, the appropriate factors must 
be applied to sample measurement results.
    11.2.7 Reporting Analytical Results. All analytical results should 
be reported in [micro]g Cr/mL using three significant figures. Field 
sample volumes (mL) must be reported also.
    11.3 GFAAS Sample Preparation.
    11.3.1 GFAAS Acid Digestion. An acid digestion of the alkaline 
impinger solution is required for the GFAAS analysis.
    11.3.1.1 In a beaker, add 10 mL of concentrated HNO<INF>3</INF> to a 
100 mL sample aliquot that has been well mixed. Cover the beaker with a 
watch glass. Place the beaker on a hot plate and reflux the sample to 
near dryness. Add another 5 mL of concentrated HNO<INF>3</INF> to 
complete the digestion. Again, carefully reflux the sample volume to 
near dryness. Rinse the beaker walls and watch glass with reagent water.
    11.3.1.2 The final concentration of HNO<INF>3</INF> in the solution 
should be 1 percent (v/v).
    11.3.1.3 Transfer the digested sample to a 50-mL volumetric flask. 
Add 0.5 mL of concentrated HNO<INF>3</INF> and 1 mL of the 10 [micro]g/
mL of Ca(NO<INF>3</INF>)<INF>2</INF>. Dilute to 50 mL with reagent 
water.
    11.3.2 HNO<INF>3</INF> Concentration. A different final volume may 
be used based on the expected Cr concentration, but the HNO<INF>3</INF> 
concentration must be maintained at 1 percent (v/v).
    11.4 GFAAS Sample Analysis.
    11.4.1 The GFAAS analysis is applicable for the determination of 
total chromium only.
    11.4.2 GFAAS Blanks. Two types of blanks are required for the GFAAS 
analysis.
    11.4.2.1 Calibration Blank. The 1.0 percent HNO<INF>3</INF> is the 
calibration blank which is used in establishing the calibration curve.
    11.4.2.2 Field Reagent Blank. An aliquot of the 0.1 N NaOH solution 
or the 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF> prepared in Section 7.1.2 is collected 
for the field reagent blank. The field reagent blank is used to assess 
possible contamination resulting from processing the sample.
    11.4.2.2.1 The reagent blank must be subjected to the entire series 
of sample preparation and analytical procedures, including the acid 
digestion.
    11.4.2.2.2 The reagent blank's final solution must contain the same 
acid concentration as the sample solutions.
    11.4.3 GFAAS Instrument Adjustment.
    11.4.3.1 The 357.9 nm wavelength line shall be used.
    11.4.3.2 Follow the manufacturer's instructions for all other 
spectrophotometer operating parameters.
    11.4.4 Furnace Operational Parameters. Parameters suggested by the 
manufacturer should be employed as guidelines.
    11.4.4.1 Temperature-sensing mechanisms and temperature controllers 
can vary between instruments and/or with time; the validity of the 
furnace operating parameters must be periodically confirmed by 
systematically altering the furnace parameters while analyzing a 
standard. In this manner, losses of analyte due to higher-than-necessary 
temperature settings or losses in sensitivity due to less than optimum 
settings can be minimized.
    11.4.4.2 Similar verification of furnace operating parameters may be 
required for complex sample matrices (consult instrument manual for 
additional information). Calibrate the GFAAS system following the 
procedures specified in Section 10.3.
    11.4.5 GFAAS Operational Quality Control Procedures.
    11.4.5.1 Introduce a measured aliquot of digested sample into the 
furnace and atomize.
    11.4.5.2 If the measured concentration exceeds the calibration 
range, the sample should be diluted with the calibration blank solution 
(1.0 percent HNO<INF>3</INF>) and reanalyzed.
    11.4.5.3 Consult the operator's manual for suggested injection 
volumes. The use of multiple injections can improve accuracy and assist 
in detecting furnace pipetting errors.
    11.4.5.4 Analyze a minimum of one matrix-matched reagent blank per 
sample batch

[[Page 377]]

to determine if contamination or any memory effects are occurring.
    11.4.5.5 Analyze a calibration blank and a continuing check standard 
after approximately every batch of 10 sample injections.
    11.4.6 GFAAS Sample Dilution.
    11.4.6.1 Dilute and reanalyze samples that are more concentrated 
than the instrument calibration range.
    11.4.6.2 If dilutions are performed, the appropriate factors must be 
applied to sample measurement results.
    11.4.7 Reporting Analytical Results.
    11.4.7.1 Calculate the Cr concentrations by the method of standard 
additions (see operator's manual) or, from direct calibration. All 
dilution and/or concentration factors must be used when calculating the 
results.
    11.4.7.2 Analytical results should be reported in [micro]g Cr/mL 
using three significant figures. Field sample volumes (mL) must be 
reported also.
    11.5 IC/PCR Sample Preparation.
    11.5.1 Sample pH. Measure and record the sample pH prior to 
analysis.
    11.5.2 Sample Filtration. Prior to preconcentration and/or analysis, 
filter all field samples through a 0.45-[micro]m filter. The filtration 
step should be conducted just prior to sample injection/analysis.
    11.5.2.1 Use a portion of the sample to rinse the syringe filtration 
unit and acetate filter and then collect the required volume of 
filtrate.
    11.5.2.2 Retain the filter if total Cr is to be determined also.
    11.5.3 Sample Preconcentration (older instruments).
    11.5.3.1 For older instruments, a preconcentration system may be 
used in conjunction with the IC/PCR to increase sensitivity for trace 
levels of Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>.
    11.5.3.2 The preconcentration is accomplished by selectively 
retaining the analyte on a solid absorbent, followed by removal of the 
analyte from the absorbent (consult instrument manual).
    11.5.3.3 For a manual system, position the injection valve so that 
the eluent displaces the concentrated Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> sample, 
transferring it from the preconcentration column and onto the IC anion 
separation column.
    11.6 IC/PCR Sample Analyses.
    11.6.1 The IC/PCR analysis is applicable for hexavalent chromium 
measurements only.
    11.6.2 IC/PCR Blanks. Two types of blanks are required for the IC/
PCR analysis.
    11.6.2.1 Calibration Blank. The calibration blank is used in 
establishing the analytical curve. For the calibration blank, use either 
0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF>, whichever is used for the 
impinger solution. The calibration blank can be prepared fresh in the 
laboratory; it does not have to be prepared from the same batch of 
absorbing solution that is used in the field.
    11.6.2.2 Field Reagent Blank. An aliquot of the 0.1 N NaOH solution 
or the 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF> solution prepared in Section 7.1.2 is 
collected for the field reagent blank. The field reagent blank is used 
to assess possible contamination resulting from processing the sample.
    11.6.3 Stabilized Baseline. Prior to sample analysis, establish a 
stable baseline with the detector set at the required attenuation by 
setting the eluent and post-column reagent flow rates according to the 
manufacturers recommendations.
    Note: As long as the ratio of eluent flow rate to PCR flow rate 
remains constant, the standard curve should remain linear. Inject a 
sample of reagent water to ensure that no Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> appears in the 
water blank.
    11.6.4 Sample Injection Loop. Size of injection loop is based on 
standard/sample concentrations and the selected attenuator setting.
    11.6.4.1 A 50-[micro]L loop is normally sufficient for most higher 
concentrations.
    11.6.4.2 The sample volume used to load the injection loop should be 
at least 10 times the loop size so that all tubing in contact with the 
sample is thoroughly flushed with the new sample to prevent cross 
contamination.
    11.6.5 IC/PCR Instrument Calibration.
    11.6.5.1 First, inject the calibration standards prepared, as 
described in Section 7.3.8 to correspond to the appropriate 
concentration range, starting with the lowest standard first.
    11.6.5.2 Check the performance of the instrument and verify the 
calibration using data gathered from analyses of laboratory blanks, 
calibration standards, and a quality control sample.
    11.6.5.3 Verify the calibration by analyzing a calibration reference 
standard. If the measured concentration exceeds the established value by 
more than 10 percent, perform a second analysis. If the measured 
concentration still exceeds the established value by more than 10 
percent, terminate the analysis until the problem can be identified and 
corrected.
    11.6.6 IC/PCR Instrument Operation.
    11.6.6.1 Inject the calibration reference standard (as described in 
Section 9.3.1), followed by the field reagent blank (Section 8.2.4), and 
the field samples.
    11.6.6.1.1 Standards (and QC standards) and samples are injected 
into the sample loop of the desired size (use a larger size loop for 
greater sensitivity). The Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> is collected on the resin bed 
of the column.
    11.6.6.1.2 After separation from other sample components, the 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> forms a specific complex in the post-column reactor with 
the DPC reaction solution, and the complex is detected by visible 
absorbance at a maximum wavelength of 540 nm.

[[Page 378]]

    11.6.6.1.3 The amount of absorbance measured is proportional to the 
concentration of the Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> complex formed.
    11.6.6.1.4 The IC retention time and the absorbance of the 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> complex with known Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> standards analyzed 
under identical conditions must be compared to provide both qualitative 
and quantitative analyses.
    11.6.6.1.5 If a sample peak appears near the expected retention time 
of the Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> ion, spike the sample according to Section 9.3.4 
to verify peak identity.
    11.6.7 IC/PCR Operational Quality Control Procedures.
    11.6.7.1 Samples should be at a pH <ls-thn-eq>=8.5 for NaOH and 
<ls-thn-eq>=8.0 if using NaHCO<INF>3</INF>; document any discrepancies.
    11.6.7.2 Refrigerated samples should be allowed to equilibrate to 
ambient temperature prior to preparation and analysis.
    11.6.7.3 Repeat the injection of the calibration standards at the 
end of the analytical run to assess instrument drift. Measure areas or 
heights of the Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>/DPC complex chromatogram peaks.
    11.6.7.4 To ensure the precision of the sample injection (manual or 
autosampler), the response for the second set of injected standards must 
be within 10 percent of the average response.
    11.6.7.5 If the 10 percent criteria duplicate injection cannot be 
achieved, identify the source of the problem and rerun the calibration 
standards.
    11.6.7.6 Use peak areas or peak heights from the injections of 
calibration standards to generate a linear calibration curve. From the 
calibration curve, determine the concentrations of the field samples.
    11.6.8 IC/PCR Sample Dilution.
    11.6.8.1 Samples having concentrations higher than the established 
calibration range must be diluted into the calibration range and re-
analyzed.
    11.6.8.2 If dilutions are performed, the appropriate factors must be 
applied to sample measurement results.
    11.6.9 Reporting Analytical Results. Results should be reported in 
[micro]g Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>/mL using three significant figures. Field 
sample volumes (mL) must be reported also.

                   12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

    12.1 Pretest Calculations.
    12.1.1 Pretest Protocol (Site Test Plan).
    12.1.1.1 The pretest protocol should define and address the test 
data quality objectives (DQOs), with all assumptions, that will be 
required by the end user (enforcement authority); what data are needed? 
why are the data needed? how will the data be used? what are method 
detection limits? and what are estimated target analyte levels for the 
following test parameters.
    12.1.1.1.1 Estimated source concentration for total chromium and/or 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>.
    12.1.1.1.2 Estimated minimum sampling time and/or volume required to 
meet method detection limit requirements (Appendix B 40 CFR Part 136) 
for measurement of total chromium and/or Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>.
    12.1.1.1.3 Demonstrate that planned sampling parameters will meet 
DQOs. The protocol must demonstrate that the planned sampling parameters 
calculated by the tester will meet the needs of the source and the 
enforcement authority.
    12.1.1.2 The pre-test protocol should include information on 
equipment, logistics, personnel, process operation, and other resources 
necessary for an efficient and coordinated test.
    12.1.1.3 At a minimum, the pre-test protocol should identify and be 
approved by the source, the tester, the analytical laboratory, and the 
regulatory enforcement authority. The tester should not proceed with the 
compliance testing before obtaining approval from the enforcement 
authority.
    12.1.2 Post Test Calculations.
    12.1.2.1 Perform the calculations, retaining one extra decimal 
figure beyond that of the acquired data. Round off figures after final 
calculations.
    12.1.2.2 Nomenclature.

C<INF>S</INF> = Concentration of Cr in sample solution, [micro]g Cr/mL.
C<INF>cr</INF> = Concentration of Cr in stack gas, dry basis, corrected 
to standard conditions, mg/dscm.
D = Digestion factor, dimension less.
F = Dilution factor, dimension less.
M<INF>Cr</INF> = Total Cr in each sample, [micro]g.
V<INF>ad</INF> = Volume of sample aliquot after digestion, mL.
V<INF>af</INF> = Volume of sample aliquot after dilution, mL.

This ratio is given by the following equation:

[[Page 379]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.573

    12.1.2.4 Digestion Factor. The digestion factor is the ratio of the 
volume of sample aliquot after digestion to the volume before digestion. 
This ratio is given by Equation 306-2.

    12.1.2.5 Total Cr in Sample. Calculate MCr, the total [micro]g Cr in 
each sample, using the following equation:

C<INF>Cr</INF>, the Cr concentration in the stack gas, in mg/dscm on a 
dry basis, corrected to standard conditions using the following 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.576

    12.1.2.9 Isokinetic Variation, Acceptable Results. Same as Method 5.

                         13.0 Method Performance

    13.1 Range. The recommended working range for all of the three 
analytical techniques starts at five times the analytical detection 
limit (see also Section 13.2.2). The upper limit of all three techniques 
can be extended indefinitely by appropriate dilution.
    13.2 Sensitivity.
    13.2.1 Analytical Sensitivity. The estimated instrumental detection 
limits listed are provided as a guide for an instrumental limit. The 
actual method detection limits are sample and instrument dependent and 
may vary as the sample matrix varies.
    13.2.1.2 ICP Analytical Sensitivity. The minimum estimated detection 
limits for ICP, as reported in Method 6010A and the recently revised 
Method 6010B of SW-846 (Reference 1), are 7.0 [micro]g Cr/L and 4.7 
[micro]g Cr/L, respectively.
    13.2.1.3 GFAAS Analytical Sensitivity. The minimum estimated 
detection limit for GFAAS, as reported in Methods 7000A and 7191 of SW-
846 (Reference 1), is 1 [micro]g Cr/L.
    13.2.1.4 IC/PCR Analytical Sensitivity. The minimum detection limit 
for IC/PCR with a preconcentrator, as reported in Methods 0061 and 7199 
of SW-846 (Reference 1), is 0.05 [micro]g Cr\+6\/L.
    1.3.2.1.5 Determination of Detection Limits. The laboratory 
performing the Cr\+6\ measurements must determine the method detection 
limit on a quarterly basis using a suitable procedure such as that found 
in 40 CFR, Part 136, Appendix B. The determination should be made on 
samples in the appropriate alkaline matrix. Normally this involves the 
preparation (if applicable) and consecutive measurement of seven (7) 
separate aliquots of a sample with a concentration <5 times the expected 
detection limit. The detection limit is 3.14 times the standard 
deviation of these results.

[[Page 380]]

    13.2.2 In-stack Sensitivity. The in-stack sensitivity depends upon 
the analytical detection limit, the volume of stack gas sampled, the 
total volume of the impinger absorbing solution plus the rinses, and, in 
some cases, dilution or concentration factors from sample preparation. 
Using the analytical detection limits given in Sections 13.2.1.1, 
13.2.1.2, and 13.2.1.3; a stack gas sample volume of 1.7 dscm; a total 
liquid sample volume of 500 mL; and the digestion concentration factor 
of 1/2 for the GFAAS analysis; the corresponding in-stack detection 
limits are 0.0014 mg Cr/dscm to 0.0021 mg Cr/dscm for ICP, 0.00015 mg 
Cr/dscm for GFAAS, and 0.000015 mg Cr\+6\/dscm for IC/PCR with 
preconcentration.

    Note: It is recommended that the concentration of Cr in the 
analytical solutions be at least five times the analytical detection 
limit to optimize sensitivity in the analyses. Using this guideline and 
the same assumptions for impinger sample volume, stack gas sample 
volume, and the digestion concentration factor for the GFAAS analysis 
(500 mL,1.7 dscm, and 1/2, respectively), the recommended minimum stack 
concentrations for optimum sensitivity are 0.0068 mg Cr/dscm to 0.0103 
mg Cr/dscm for ICP, 0.00074 mg Cr/dscm for GFAAS, and 0.000074 mg 
Cr\+6\/dscm for IC/PCR with preconcentration. If required, the in-stack 
detection limits can be improved by either increasing the stack gas 
sample volume, further reducing the volume of the digested sample for 
GFAAS, improving the analytical detection limits, or any combination of 
the three.

    13.3 Precision.
    13.3.1 The following precision data have been reported for the three 
analytical methods. In each case, when the sampling precision is 
combined with the reported analytical precision, the resulting overall 
precision may decrease.
    13.3.2 Bias data is also reported for GFAAS.
    13.4 ICP Precision.
    13.4.1 As reported in Method 6010B of SW-846 (Reference 1), in an 
EPA round-robin Phase 1 study, seven laboratories applied the ICP 
technique to acid/distilled water matrices that had been spiked with 
various metal concentrates. For true values of 10, 50, and 150 [micro]g 
Cr/L; the mean reported values were 10, 50, and 149 [micro]g Cr/L; and 
the mean percent relative standard deviations were 18, 3.3, and 3.8 
percent, respectively.
    13.4.2 In another multi laboratory study cited in Method 6010B, a 
mean relative standard of 8.2 percent was reported for an aqueous sample 
concentration of approximately 3750 [micro]g Cr/L.
    13.5 GFAAS Precision. As reported in Method 7191 of SW-846 
(Reference 1), in a single laboratory (EMSL), using Cincinnati, Ohio tap 
water spiked at concentrations of 19, 48, and 77 [micro]g Cr/L, the 
standard deviations were <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.1, <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.2, and <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.8, respectively. 
Recoveries at these levels were 97 percent, 101 percent, and 102 
percent, respectively.
    13.6 IC/PCR Precision. As reported in Methods 0061 and 7199 of SW-
846 (Reference 1), the precision of IC/PCR with sample preconcentration 
is 5 to 10 percent. The overall precision for sewage sludge incinerators 
emitting 120 ng/dscm of Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> and 3.5 [micro]g/dscm of total 
Cr was 25 percent and 9 percent, respectively; and for hazardous waste 
incinerators emitting 300 ng/dscm of C<SUP>+6</SUP> the precision was 20 
percent.

                        14.0 Pollution Prevention

    14.1 The only materials used in this method that could be considered 
pollutants are the chromium standards used for instrument calibration 
and acids used in the cleaning of the collection and measurement 
containers/labware, in the preparation of standards, and in the acid 
digestion of samples. Both reagents can be stored in the same waste 
container.
    14.2 Cleaning solutions containing acids should be prepared in 
volumes consistent with use to minimize the disposal of excessive 
volumes of acid.
    14.3 To the extent possible, the containers/vessels used to collect 
and prepare samples should be cleaned and reused to minimize the 
generation of solid waste.

                          15.0 Waste Management

    15.1 It is the responsibility of the laboratory and the sampling 
team to comply with all federal, state, and local regulations governing 
waste management, particularly the discharge regulations, hazardous 
waste identification rules, and land disposal restrictions; and to 
protect the air, water, and land by minimizing and controlling all 
releases from field operations.

Management Manual for Laboratory Personnel and Less is Better--

American Chemical Society's Department of Government Relations and 
Science Policy, 1155 16th Street NW, Washington, DC 20036.

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 Analyte. Chromium. CAS Number (7440-47-3).
    1.2 Applicability.

[[Page 383]]

    1.2.1 This method applies to the determination of chromium (Cr) in 
emissions from decorative and hard chromium electroplating facilities, 
chromium anodizing operations, and continuous chromium plating at iron 
and steel facilities. The method is less expensive and less complex to 
conduct than Method 306. Correctly applied, the precision and bias of 
the sample results should be comparable to those obtained with the 
isokinetic Method 306. This method is applicable for the determination 
of air emissions under nominal ambient moisture, temperature, and 
pressure conditions.
    1.2.2 The method is also applicable to electroplating and anodizing 
sources controlled by wet scrubbers.
    1.3 Data Quality Objectives.
    1.3.1 Pretest Protocol.
    1.3.1.1 The pretest protocol should define and address the test data 
quality objectives (DQOs), with all assumptions, that will be required 
by the end user (enforcement authority); what data are needed? why are 
the data needed? how will data be used? what are method detection 
limits? and what are estimated target analyte levels for the following 
test parameters.
    1.3.1.1.1 Estimated source concentration for total chromium and/or 
Cr\+6\.
    1.3.1.1.2 Estimated minimum sampling time and/or volume required to 
meet method detection limit requirements (Appendix B 40 CFR Part 136) 
for measurement of total chromium and/or Cr\+6\.
    1.3.1.1.3 Demonstrate that planned sampling parameters will meet 
DQOs. The protocol must demonstrate that the planned sampling parameters 
calculated by the tester will meet the needs of the source and the 
enforcement authority.
    1.3.1.2 The pre-test protocol should include information on 
equipment, logistics, personnel, process operation, and other resources 
necessary for an efficient and coordinated performance test.
    1.3.1.3 At a minimum, the pre-test protocol should identify and be 
approved by the source, the tester, the analytical laboratory, and the 
regulatory enforcement authority. The tester should not proceed with the 
compliance testing before obtaining approval from the enforcement 
authority.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 Sampling.
    2.1.1 An emission sample is extracted from the source at a constant 
sampling rate determined by a critical orifice and collected in a 
sampling train composed of a probe and impingers. The proportional 
sampling time at the cross sectional traverse points is varied according 
to the stack gas velocity at each point. The total sample time must be 
at least two hours.
    2.1.2 The chromium emission concentration is determined by the same 
analytical procedures described in Method 306: inductively-coupled 
plasma emission spectrometry (ICP), graphite furnace atomic absorption 
spectrometry (GFAAS), or ion chromatography with a post-column reactor 
(IC/PCR).
    2.1.2.1 Total chromium samples with high chromium concentrations 
(<ls-thn-eq>=35 [micro]g/L) may be analyzed using inductively coupled 
plasma emission spectrometry (ICP) at 267.72 nm.
    Note: The ICP analysis is applicable for this method only when the 
solution analyzed has a Cr concentration greater than or equal to 35 
[micro]g/L or five times the method detection limit as determined 
according to Appendix B in 40 CFR Part 136.
    2.1.2.2 Alternatively, when lower total chromium concentrations (<35 
[micro]g/L) are encountered, a portion of the alkaline sample solution 
may be digested with nitric acid and analyzed by graphite furnace atomic 
absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) at 357.9 nm.
    2.1.2.3 If it is desirable to determine hexavalent chromium (Cr\+6\) 
emissions, the samples may be analyzed using an ion chromatograph 
equipped with a post-column reactor (IC/PCR) and a visible wavelength 
detector. To increase sensitivity for trace levels of Cr\+6\, a 
preconcentration system may be used in conjunction with the IC/PCR.

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

    Note: Mention of trade names or specific products does not 
constitute endorsement by the Environmental Protection Agency.
    6.1 Sampling Train. A schematic of the sampling train is shown in 
Figure 306A-1. The individual components of the train are available 
commercially, however, some fabrication and assembly are required.
    6.1.1 Probe Nozzle/Tubing and Sheath.
    6.1.1.1 Use approximately 6.4-mm (\1/4\-in.) inside diameter (ID) 
glass or rigid plastic tubing approximately 20 cm (8 in.) in length with 
a short 90 degree bend at one end to form the sampling nozzle. Grind a 
slight taper on the nozzle end before making the bend. Attach the nozzle 
to flexible tubing of sufficient length to enable collection of a sample 
from the stack.
    6.1.1.2 Use a straight piece of larger diameter rigid tubing (such 
as metal conduit or plastic water pipe) to form a sheath that begins 
about 2.5 cm (1 in.) from the 90 [deg] bend on the nozzle and encases 
and supports the flexible tubing.

polypropylene, or polyvinyl chloride)  6.4-mm (\1/4\-in.) to 9.5-mm (\3/
8\-in.) ID to connect the train components.
    6.1.4.2 A combination of rigid plastic tubing and thin wall flexible 
tubing may be used as long as tubing walls do not collapse when leak-
checking the train. Metal tubing cannot be used.
    6.1.5 Impingers. Three, one-quart capacity, glass canning jars with 
vacuum seal lids, or three Greenburg-Smith (GS) design impingers 
connected in series, or equivalent, may be used.
    6.1.5.1 One-quart glass canning jar. Three separate jar containers 
are required: (1) the first jar contains the absorbing solution; (2) the 
second is empty and is used to collect any reagent carried over from the 
first container; and (3) the third contains the desiccant drying agent.
    6.1.5.2 Canning Jar Connectors. The jar containers are connected by 
leak-tight inlet and outlet tubes installed in the lids of each 
container for assembly with the train. The tubes may be made of  6.4 mm 
(\1/4\-in.) ID glass or rigid plastic tubing. For the inlet tube of the 
first impinger, heat the glass or plastic tubing and draw until the 
tubing separates. Fabricate the necked tip to form an orifice tip that 
is approximately 2.4 mm (\3/32\-in.) ID.
    6.1.5.2.1 When assembling the first container, place the orifice tip 
end of the tube approximately 4.8 mm (\3/16\-in.) above the inside 
bottom of the jar.
    6.1.5.2.2 For the second container, the inlet tube need not be drawn 
and sized, but the tip should be approximately 25 mm (1 in.) above the 
bottom of the jar.
    6.1.5.2.3 The inlet tube of the third container should extend to 
approximately 12.7 mm (\1/2\-in.) above the bottom of the jar.
    6.1.5.2.4 Extend the outlet tube for each container approximately 50 
mm (2 in.) above the jar lid and downward through the lid, approximately 
12.7 mm (\1/2\-in.) beneath the bottom of the lid.
    6.1.5.3 Greenburg-Smith Impingers. Three separate impingers of the 
Greenburg-Smith (GS) design as described in Section 6.0 of Method 5 are 
required. The first GS impinger shall have a standard tip (orifice/
plate), and the second and third GS impingers shall be modified by 
replacing the orifice/plate tube with a 13 mm (\1/2\-in.) ID glass tube, 
having an unrestricted opening located 13 mm (\1/2\-in.) from the bottom 
of the outer flask.
    6.1.5.4 Greenburg-Smith Connectors. The GS impingers shall be 
connected by leak-free ground glass ``U'' tube connectors or by leak-
free non-contaminating flexible tubing. The first impinger shall contain 
the absorbing solution, the second is empty and the third contains the 
desiccant drying agent.
    6.1.6 Manometer. Inclined/vertical type, or equivalent device, as 
described in Section 6.2 of Method 2 (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A).
    6.1.7 Critical Orifice. The critical orifice is a small restriction 
in the sample line that is located upstream of the vacuum pump. The 
orifice produces a constant sampling flow rate that is approximately 
0.021 cubic meters per minute (m3/min) or 0.75 cubic feet per minute 
(cfm).
    6.1.7.1 The critical orifice can be constructed by sealing a 2.4-mm 
(\3/32\-in.) ID brass tube approximately 14.3 mm (\9/16\-in.) in length 
inside a second brass tube that is approximately 8 mm (\5/16\-in.) ID 
and 14.3-mm (\9/16\-in.) in length .
    6.1.7.2 Materials other than brass can be used to construct the 
critical orifice as long as the flow through the sampling train can be 
maintained at approximately 0.021 cubic meter per minute (0.75) cfm.
    6.1.8 Connecting Hardware. Standard pipe and fittings, 9.5-mm (\3/
8\-in.), 6.4-mm (\1/4\-in.)

orifice and the vacuum pump.
    6.1.10 Pump Oiler. A glass oil reservoir with a wick mounted at the 
vacuum pump inlet that lubricates the pump vanes. The oiler should be an 
in-line type and not vented to the atmosphere. See EMTIC Guideline

    6.1.11 Vacuum Pump. Gast Model 0522-V103-G18DX, or equivalent, 
capable of delivering at least 1.5 cfm at 15 in. H<INF>g</INF> vacuum.
    6.1.12 Oil Trap/Muffler. An empty glass oil reservoir without wick 
mounted at the pump outlet to control the pump noise and prevent oil 
from reaching the dry gas meter.
    6.1.13 By-pass Fine Adjust Valve (Optional). Needle valve assembly 
6.4-mm (\1/4\-in.), Whitey 1 RF 4-A, or equivalent, that allows for 
adjustment of the train vacuum.
    6.1.13.1 A fine-adjustment valve is positioned in the optional pump 
by-pass system that allows the gas flow to recirculate through the pump. 
This by-pass system allows the tester to control/reduce the maximum 
leak-check vacuum pressure produced by the pump.
    6.1.13.1.1 The tester must conduct the post test leak check at a 
vacuum equal to or greater than the maximum vacuum encountered during 
the sampling run.
    6.1.13.1.2 The pump by-pass assembly is not required, but is 
recommended if the tester intends to leak-check the 306A train at the 
vacuum experienced during a run.
    6.1.14 Dry Gas Meter. An Equimeter Model 110 test meter or, 
equivalent with temperature sensor(s) installed (inlet/outlet) to 
monitor the meter temperature. If only one temperature sensor is 
installed, locate the sensor at the outlet side of the meter. The dry 
gas meter must be capable of measuring the gaseous volume to within 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2% of the true volume.
    Note: The Method 306 sampling train is also commercially available 
and may be used to perform the Method 306A tests. The sampling train may 
be assembled as specified in Method 306A with the sampling rate being 
operated at the delta H<INF>@</INF> specified for the calibrated orifice 
located in the meter box. The Method 306 train is then operated as 
described in Method 306A.
    6.2 Barometer. Mercury aneroid barometer, or other barometer 
equivalent, capable of measuring atmospheric pressure to within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2.5 mm H<INF>g</INF> (0.1 in. H<INF>g</INF>).
    6.2.1 A preliminary check of the barometer shall be made against a 
mercury-in-glass reference barometer or its equivalent.
    6.2.2 Tester may elect to obtain the absolute barometric pressure 
from a nearby National Weather Service station.
    6.2.2.1 The station value (which is the absolute barometric 
pressure) must be adjusted for elevation differences between the weather 
station and the sampling location. Either subtract 2.5 mm H<INF>g</INF> 
(0.1 in. H<INF>g</INF>) from the station value per 30 m (100 ft) of 
elevation increase or add the same for an elevation decrease.
    6.2.2.2 If the field barometer cannot be adjusted to agree within 
0.1 in. H<INF>g</INF> of the reference barometric, repair or discard the 
unit. The barometer pressure measurement shall be recorded on the 
sampling data sheet.
    6.3 Sample Recovery. Same as Method 5, Section 6.2 (40 CFR Part 60, 
Appendix A), with the following exceptions:
    6.3.1 Probe-Liner and Probe-Nozzle Brushes. Brushes are not 
necessary for sample recovery. If a probe brush is used, it must be non-
metallic.
    6.3.2 Wash Bottles. Polyethylene wash bottle, for sample recovery 
absorbing solution.
    6.3.3 Sample Recovery Solution. Use 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N 
NaHCO<INF>3</INF>, whichever is used as the impinger absorbing solution, 
to replace the acetone.
    6.3.4 Sample Storage Containers.
    6.3.4.1 Glass Canning Jar. The first canning jar container of the 
sampling train may serve as the sample shipping container. A new lid and 
sealing plastic wrap shall be substituted for the container lid 
assembly.
    6.3.4.2 Polyethylene or Glass Containers. Transfer the Greenburg-
Smith impinger contents to precleaned polyethylene or glass containers. 
The samples shall be stored and shipped in 250-mL, 500-mL or 1000-mL

    6.4 Analysis. Same as Method 306, Section 6.3.

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards.

    Note: Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents shall conform to the 
specifications established by the Committee on Analytical Reagents of 
the American Chemical Society (ACS reagent grade). Where such 
specifications are not available, use the best available grade. It is 
recommended, but not required, that reagents be checked by the 
appropriate analysis prior to field use to assure that contamination is 
below the analytical detection limit for the ICP or GFAAS total chromium 
analysis; and that contamination is below the analytical detection limit 
for

[[Page 386]]

Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> using IC/PCR for direct injection or, if selected, 
preconcentration.
    7.1 Sampling.
    7.1.1 Water. Reagent water that conforms to ASTM Specification D1193 
Type II (incorporated by reference see Sec. 63.14). All references to 
water in the method refer to reagent water unless otherwise specified. 
It is recommended that water blanks be checked prior to preparing the 
sampling reagents to ensure that the Cr content is less than three (3) 
times the anticipated detection limit of the analytical method.
    7.1.2 Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) Absorbing Solution, 0.1 N. Dissolve 
4.0 g of sodium hydroxide in 1 liter of water to obtain a pH of 
approximately 8.5.
    7.1.3 Sodium Bicarbonate (NaHCO<INF>3</INF>) Absorbing Solution, 0.1 
N. Dissolve approximately 8.5 g of sodium bicarbonate in 1 liter of 
water to obtain a pH of approximately 8.3.
    7.1.4 Chromium Contamination.
    7.1.4.1 The absorbing solution shall not exceed the QC criteria 
noted in Method 306, Section 7.1.1 (<=3 times the instrument detection 
limit).
    7.1.4.2 When the Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> content in the field samples 
exceeds the blank concentration by at least a factor of ten (10), 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> blank levels <=10 times the detection limit will be 
allowed.

    Note: At sources with high concentrations of acids and/or 
SO<INF>2</INF>, the concentration of NaOH or NaHCO<INF>3</INF> should be 
<ls-thn-eq>=0.5 N to insure that the pH of the solution remains at or 
above 8.5 for NaOH and 8.0 for NaHCO<INF>3</INF> during and after 
sampling.

    7.1.3 Desiccant. Silica Gel, 6-16 mesh, indicating type. 
Alternatively, other types of desiccants may be used, subject to the 
approval of the Administrator.
    7.2 Sample Recovery. Same as Method 306, Section 7.2.
    7.3 Sample Preparation and Analysis. Same as Method 306, Section 
7.3.
    7.4 Glassware Cleaning Reagents. Same as Method 306, Section 7.4.
    7.5 Quality Assurance Audit Samples.
    7.5.1 It is recommended, but not required, that a performance audit 
sample be analyzed in conjunction with the field samples. The audit 
sample should be in a suitable sample matrix at a concentration similar 
to the actual field samples.
    7.5.2 When making compliance determinations, and upon availability, 
audit samples may be obtained from the appropriate EPA regional Office 
or from the responsible enforcement authority and analyzed in 
conjunction with the field samples.

    Note: The responsible enforcement authority should be notified at 
least 30 days prior to the test date to allow sufficient time for the 
audit sample to be delivered.

 8.0 Sample Collection, Recovery, Preservation, Holding Times, Storage, 
                              and Transport

    Note: Prior to sample collection, consideration should be given as 
to the type of analysis (Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> or total Cr) that will be 
performed. Deciding which analysis will be performed will enable the 
tester to determine which appropriate sample recovery and storage 
procedures will be required to process the sample.

    8.1 Sample Collection.
    8.1.1 Pretest Preparation.
    8.1.1.1 Selection of Measurement Site. Locate the sampling ports as 
specified in Section 11.0 of Method 1 (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A).
    8.1.1.2 Location of Traverse Points.
    8.1.1.2.1 Locate the traverse points as specified in Section 11.0 of 
Method 1 (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A). Use a total of 24 sampling points 
for round ducts and 24 or 25 points for rectangular ducts. Mark the 
pitot and sampling probe to identify the sample traversing points.
    8.1.1.2.2 For round ducts less than 12 inches in diameter, use a 
total of 16 points.
    8.1.1.3 Velocity Pressure Traverse. Perform an initial velocity 
traverse before obtaining samples. The Figure 306A-2 data sheet may be 
used to record velocity traverse data.
    8.1.1.3.1 To demonstrate that the flow rate is constant over several 
days of testing, perform complete traverses at the beginning and end of 
each day's test effort, and calculate the deviation of the flow rate for 
each daily period. The beginning and end flow rates are considered 
constant if the deviation does not exceed 10 percent. If the flow rate 
exceeds the 10 percent criteria, either correct the inconsistent flow 
rate problem, or obtain the Administrator's approval for the test 
results.
    8.1.1.3.2 Perform traverses as specified in Section 8.0 of Method 2, 
but record only the [Delta]p (velocity pressure) values for each 
sampling point. If a mass emission rate is desired, stack velocity 
pressures shall be recorded before and after each test, and an average 
stack velocity pressure determined for the testing period.
    8.1.1.4 Verification of Absence of Cyclonic Flow. Check for cyclonic 
flow during the initial traverse to verify that it does not exist. 
Perform the cyclonic flow check as specified in Section 11.4 of Method 1 
(40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A).
    8.1.1.4.1 If cyclonic flow is present, verify that the absolute 
average angle of the tangential flow does not exceed 20 degrees. If the 
average value exceeds 20 degrees at the sampling location, the flow 
condition in the stack is unacceptable for testing.

[[Page 387]]

    8.1.1.4.2 Alternative procedures, subject to approval of the 
Administrator, e.g., installing straightening vanes to eliminate the 
cyclonic flow, must be implemented prior to conducting the testing.
    8.1.1.5 Stack Gas Moisture Measurements. Not required. Measuring the 
moisture content is optional when a mass emission rate is to be 
calculated.
    8.1.1.5.1 The tester may elect to either measure the actual stack 
gas moisture during the sampling run or utilize a nominal moisture value 
of 2 percent.
    8.1.1.5.2 For additional information on determining sampling train 
moisture, please refer to Method 4 (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A).
    8.1.1.6 Stack Temperature Measurements. If a mass emission rate is 
to be calculated, a temperature sensor must be placed either near the 
center of the stack, or attached to the pitot tube as described in 
Section 8.3 of Method 2. Stack temperature measurements, shall be 
recorded before and after each test, and an average stack temperature 
determined for the testing period.
    8.1.1.7 Point Sampling Times. Since the sampling rate of the train 
(0.75 cfm) is maintained constant by the critical orifice, it is 
necessary to calculate specific sampling times for each traverse point 
in order to obtain a proportional sample.
    8.1.1.7.1 If the sampling period (3 runs) is to be completed in a 
single day, the point sampling times shall be calculated only once.
    8.1.1.7.2 If the sampling period is to occur over several days, the 
sampling times must be calculated daily using the initial velocity 
pressure data recorded for that day. Determine the average of the 
[Delta]p values obtained during the velocity traverse (Figure 306A-2).
    8.1.1.7.3 If the stack diameter is less than 12 inches, use 7.5 
minutes in place of 5 minutes in the equation and 16 sampling points 
instead of 24 or 25 points. Calculate the sampling times for each 
traverse point using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.579

Where:
n = Sampling point number.
[Delta]p = Average pressure differential across pitot tube, mm 
H<INF>2</INF>O (in. H<INF>2</INF>O).
[Delta]P<INF>avg</INF> = Average of [Delta]p values, mm H<INF>2</INF>O 
(in. H<INF>2</INF>O).

    Note: Convert the decimal fractions for minutes to seconds.
    8.1.1.8 Pretest Preparation. It is recommended, but not required, 
that all items which will be in contact with the sample be cleaned prior 
to performing the testing to avoid possible sample contamination 
(positive chromium bias). These items include, but are not limited to: 
Sampling probe, connecting tubing, impingers, and jar containers.
    8.1.1.8.1 Sample train components should be: (1) Rinsed with hot tap 
water; (2) washed with hot soapy water; (3) rinsed with tap water; (4) 
rinsed with reagent water; (5) soaked in a 10 percent (v/v) nitric acid 
solution for at least four hours; and (6) rinsed throughly with reagent 
water before use.
    8.1.1.8.2 At a minimum, the tester should, rinse the probe, 
connecting tubing, and first and second impingers twice with either 0.1 
N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or 0.1 N sodium bicarbonate 
(NaHCO<INF>3</INF>) and discard the rinse solution.
    8.1.1.8.3 If separate sample shipping containers are to be used, 
these also should be precleaned using the specified cleaning procedures.
    8.1.1.9 Preparation of Sampling Train. Assemble the sampling train 
as shown in Figure 306A-1. Secure the nozzle-liner assembly to the outer 
sheath to prevent movement when sampling.
    8.1.1.9.1 Place 250 mL of 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF> 
absorbing solution into the first jar container or impinger. The second 
jar/impinger is to remain empty. Place 6 to 16 mesh indicating silica 
gel, or equivalent desiccant into the third jar/impinger until the 
container is half full ( 300 to 400 g).
    8.1.1.9.2 Place a small cotton ball in the outlet exit tube of the 
third jar to collect small silica gel particles that may dislodge and 
impair the pump and/or gas meter.
    8.1.1.10 Pretest Leak-Check. A pretest leak-check is recommended, 
but not required. If the tester opts to conduct the pretest leak-check, 
the following procedures shall be performed: (1) Place the jar/impinger 
containers into an ice bath and wait 10 minutes for the ice to cool the 
containers before performing the leak check and/or start sampling; (2) 
to perform the leak check, seal the nozzle using a piece of clear 
plastic wrap placed over the end of a finger and switch on the pump; and 
(3) the train system leak rate should not exceed 0.02 cfm at a vacuum of 
380 mm Hg (15 in. Hg) or greater. If the leak rate

[[Page 388]]

does exceed the 0.02 cfm requirement, identify and repair the leak area 
and perform the leak check again.

    Note: Use caution when releasing the vacuum following the leak 
check. Always allow air to slowly flow through the nozzle end of the 
train system while the pump is still operating. Switching off the pump 
with vacuum on the system may result in the silica gel being pulled into 
the second jar container.
    8.1.1.11 Leak-Checks During Sample Run. If, during the sampling run, 
a component (e.g., jar container) exchange becomes necessary, a leak-
check shall be conducted immediately before the component exchange is 
made. The leak-check shall be performed according to the procedure 
outlined in Section 8.1.1.10 of this method. If the leakage rate is 
found to be <= 0.02 cfm at the maximum operating vacuum, the results are 
acceptable. If, however, a higher leak rate is obtained, either record 
the leakage rate and correct the sample volume as shown in Section 12.3 
of Method 5 or void the sample and initiate a replacement run. Following 
the component change, leak-checks are optional, but are recommended as 
are the pretest leak-checks.
    8.1.1.12 Post Test Leak Check. Remove the probe assembly and 
flexible tubing from the first jar/impinger container. Seal the inlet 
tube of the first container using clear plastic wrap and switch on the 
pump. The vacuum in the line between the pump and the critical orifice 
must be <ls-thn-eq>=15 in. Hg. Record the vacuum gauge measurement along 
with the leak rate observed on the train system.
    8.1.1.12.1 If the leak rate does not exceed 0.02 cfm, the results 
are acceptable and no sample volume correction is necessary.
    8.1.1.12.2 If, however, a higher leak rate is obtained 
(<ls-thn-eq>0.02 cfm), the tester shall either record the leakage rate 
and correct the sample volume as shown in Section 12.3 of Method 5, or 
void the sampling run and initiate a replacement run. After completing 
the leak-check, slowly release the vacuum at the first container while 
the pump is still operating. Afterwards, switch-off the pump.
    8.1.2 Sample Train Operation.
    8.1.2.1 Data Recording. Record all pertinent process and sampling 
data on the data sheet (see Figure 306A-3). Ensure that the process 
operation is suitable for sample collection.
    8.1.2.2 Starting the Test. Place the probe/nozzle into the duct at 
the first sampling point and switch on the pump. Start the sampling 
using the time interval calculated for the first point. When the first 
point sampling time has been completed, move to the second point and 
continue to sample for the time interval calculated for that point; 
sample each point on the traverse in this manner. Maintain ice around 
the sample containers during the run.
    8.1.2.3 Critical Flow. The sample line between the critical orifice 
and the pump must operate at a vacuum of <ls-thn-eq>= 380 mm Hg 
(<ls-thn-eq>=15 in. Hg) in order for critical flow to be maintained. 
This vacuum must be monitored and documented using the vacuum gauge 
located between the critical orifice and the pump.

    Note: Theoretically, critical flow for air occurs when the ratio of 
the orifice outlet absolute pressure to the orifice inlet absolute 
pressure is less than a factor of 0.53. This means that the system 
vacuum should be at least <ls-thn-eq>= 356 mm Hg (<ls-thn-eq>= 14 in. 
Hg) at sea level and  305 mm Hg ( 12 in. Hg) at higher elevations.

    8.1.2.4 Completion of Test.
    8.1.2.4.1 Circular Stacks. Complete the first port traverse and 
switch off the pump. Testers may opt to perform a leak-check between the 
port changes to verify the leak rate however, this is not mandatory. 
Move the sampling train to the next sampling port and repeat the 
sequence. Be sure to record the final dry gas meter reading after 
completing the test run. After performing the post test leak check, 
disconnect the jar/impinger containers from the pump and meter assembly 
and transport the probe, connecting tubing, and containers to the sample 
recovery area.
    8.1.2.4.2 Rectangle Stacks. Complete each port traverse as per the 
instructions provided in 8.1.2.4.1.

    Note: If an approximate mass emission rate is to be calculated, 
measure and record the stack velocity pressure and temperature before 
and after the test run.

    8.2 Sample Recovery. After the train has been transferred to the 
sample recovery area, disconnect the tubing that connects the jar/
impingers. The tester shall select either the total Cr or 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> sample recovery option. Samples to be analyzed for both 
total Cr and Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> shall be recovered using the 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> sample option (Section 8.2.2).

    Note: Collect a reagent blank sample for each of the total Cr or the 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> analytical options. If both analyses (Cr and 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>) are to be conducted on the samples, collect separate 
reagent blanks for each analysis.

    8.2.1 Total Cr Sample Option.
    8.2.1.1 Shipping Container No. 1. The first jar container may either 
be used to store and transport the sample, or if GS impingers are used, 
samples may be stored and shipped in precleaned 250-mL, 500-mL or 1000-
mL polyethylene or glass bottles with leak-free, non-metal screw caps.
    8.2.1.1.1 Unscrew the lid from the first jar/impinger container.
    8.2.1.1.2 Lift the inner tube assembly almost out of the container, 
and using the wash bottle containing fresh absorbing solution, rinse the 
outside of the tube that was immersed in the container solution; rinse

[[Page 389]]

the inside of the tube as well, by rinsing twice from the top of the 
tube down through the inner tube into the container.
    8.2.1.2 Recover the contents of the second jar/impinger container by 
removing the lid and pouring any contents into the first shipping 
container.
    8.2.1.2.1 Rinse twice, using fresh absorbing solution, the inner 
walls of the second container including the inside and outside of the 
inner tube.
    8.2.1.2.2 Rinse the connecting tubing between the first and second 
sample containers with absorbing solution and place the rinses into the 
first container.
    8.2.1.3 Position the nozzle, probe and connecting plastic tubing in 
a vertical position so that the tubing forms a ``U''.
    8.2.1.3.1 Using the wash bottle, partially fill the tubing with 
fresh absorbing solution. Raise and lower the end of the plastic tubing 
several times to allow the solution to contact the internal surfaces. Do 
not allow the solution to overflow or part of the sample will be lost. 
Place the nozzle end of the probe over the mouth of the first container 
and elevate the plastic tubing so that the solution flows into the 
sample container.
    8.2.1.3.2 Repeat the probe/tubing sample recovery procedure but 
allow the solution to flow out the opposite end of the plastic tubing 
into the sample container. Repeat the entire sample recovery procedure 
once again.
    8.2.1.4 Use approximately 200 to 300 mL of the 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N 
NaHCO<INF>3</INF> absorbing solution during the rinsing of the probe 
nozzle, probe liner, sample containers, and connecting tubing.
    8.2.1.5 Place a piece of clear plastic wrap over the mouth of the 
sample jar to seal the shipping container. Use a standard lid and band 
assembly to seal and secure the sample in the jar.
    8.2.1.5.1 Label the jar clearly to identify its contents, sample 
number and date.
    8.2.1.5.2 Mark the height of the liquid level on the container to 
identify any losses during shipping and handling.
    8.2.1.5.3 Prepare a chain-of-custody sheet to accompany the sample 
to the laboratory.
    8.2.2 Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> Sample Option.
    8.2.2.1 Shipping Container No. 1. The first jar container may either 
be used to store and transport the sample, or if GS impingers are used, 
samples may be stored and shipped in precleaned 250-mL, 500-mL or 1000-
mL polyethylene or glass bottles with leak-free non-metal screw caps.
    8.2.2.1.1 Unscrew and remove the lid from the first jar container.
    8.2.2.1.2 Measure and record the pH of the solution in the first 
container by using a pH indicator strip. The pH of the solution must be 
<ls-thn-eq>=8.5 for NaOH and <ls-thn-eq>=8.0 for NaHCO<INF>3</INF>. If 
not, discard the collected sample, increase the concentration of the 
NaOH or NaHCO3 absorbing solution to 0.5 M and collect another air 
emission sample.
    8.2.2.2 After measuring the pH of the first container, follow sample 
recovery procedures described in Sections 8.2.1.1 through 8.2.1.5.

    Note: Since particulate matter is not usually present at chromium 
electroplating and/or chromium anodizing facilities, it is not necessary 
to filter the Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> samples unless there is observed sediment 
in the collected solutions. If it is necessary to filter the 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> solutions, please refer to the EPA Method 0061, 
Determination of Hexavalent Chromium Emissions from Stationary Sources, 
Section 7.4, Sample Preparation in SW-846 (see Reference 5) for 
procedure.

    8.2.3 Silica Gel Container. Observe the color of the indicating 
silica gel to determine if it has been completely spent and make a 
notation of its condition/color on the field data sheet. Do not use 
water or other liquids to remove and transfer the silica gel.
    8.2.4 Total Cr and/or Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> Reagent Blank.
    8.2.4.1 Shipping Container No. 2. Place approximately 500 mL of the 
0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF> absorbing solution in a 
precleaned, labeled sample container and include with the field samples 
for analysis.
    8.3 Sample Preservation, Storage, and Transport.
    8.3.1 Total Cr Option. Samples that are to be analyzed for total Cr 
need not be refrigerated.
    8.3.2 Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> Option. Samples that are to be analyzed for 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> must be shipped and stored at 4 [deg]C (40 [deg]F).

    Note: Allow Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> samples to return to ambient temperature 
prior to analysis.

    8.4 Sample Holding Times.
    8.4.1 Total Cr Option. Samples that are to be analyzed for total 
chromium must be analyzed within 60 days of collection.

Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> must be analyzed within 14 days of collection.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 Same as Method 306, Section 9.0.

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    Note: Tester shall maintain a performance log of all calibration 
results.

    10.1 Pitot Tube. The Type S pitot tube assembly shall be calibrated 
according to the procedures outlined in Section 10.1 of Method 2.
    10.2 Temperature Sensor. Use the procedure in Section 10.3 of Method 
2 to calibrate the in-stack temperature sensor.
    10.3 Metering System.
    10.3.1 Sample Train Dry Gas Meter Calibration. Calibrations may be 
performed as described in Section 16.2 of Method 5 by either the 
manufacturer, a firm who provides calibration services, or the tester.

[[Page 390]]

    10.3.2 Dry Gas Meter Calibration Coefficient (Y<INF>m</INF>). The 
meter calibration coefficient (Y<INF>m</INF>) must be determined prior 
to the initial use of the meter, and following each field test program. 
If the dry gas meter is new, the manufacturer will have specified the 
Y<INF>m</INF> value for the meter. This Y<INF>m</INF> value can be used 
as the pretest value for the first test. For subsequent tests, the 
tester must use the Y<INF>m</INF> value established during the pretest 
calibration.
    10.3.3 Calibration Orifice. The manufacturer may have included a 
calibration orifice and a summary spreadsheet with the meter that may be 
used for calibration purposes. The spreadsheet will provide data 
necessary to determine the calibration for the orifice and meter 
(standard cubic feet volume, sample time, etc.). These data were 
produced when the initial Y<INF>m</INF> value was determined for the 
meter.
    10.3.4 Y<INF>m</INF> Meter Value Verification or Meter Calibration.
    10.3.4.1 The Y<INF>m</INF> meter value may be determined by 
replacing the sampling train critical orifice with the calibration 
orifice. Replace the critical orifice assembly by installing the 
calibration orifice in the same location. The inlet side of the 
calibration orifice is to be left open to the atmosphere and is not to 
be reconnected to the sample train during the calibration procedure.
    10.3.4.2 If the vacuum pump is cold, switch on the pump and allow it 
to operate (become warm) for several minutes prior to starting the 
calibration. After stopping the pump, record the initial dry gas meter 
volume and meter temperature.
    10.3.4.3 Perform the calibration for the number of minutes specified 
by the manufacturer's data sheet (usually 5 minutes). Stop the pump and 
record the final dry gas meter volume and temperature. Subtract the 
start volume from the stop volume to obtain the V<INF>m</INF> and 
average the meter temperatures (t<INF>m</INF>).
    10.3.5 Y<INF>m</INF> Value Calculation. Y<INF>m</INF> is the 
calculated value for the dry gas meter. Calculate Y<INF>m</INF> using 
the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.580

Where:

P<INF>bar</INF> = Barometric pressure at meter, mm Hg, (in. Hg).
P<INF>std</INF> = Standard absolute pressure,
Metric = 760 mm Hg.
English = 29.92 in. Hg.
t<INF>m</INF> = Average dry gas meter temperature, [deg]C, ([deg]F).
T<INF>m</INF> = Absolute average dry gas meter temperature,
Metric [deg]K = 273 + tm ([deg]C).
English [deg]R = 460 + t<INF>m</INF>([deg]F).
T<INF>std</INF> = Standard absolute temperature,
Metric = 293 [deg]K.
English = 528 [deg]R.
V<INF>m</INF> = Volume of gas sample as measured (actual) by dry gas 
meter, dcm,(dcf).
V<INF>m(std),mfg</INF> = Volume of gas sample measured by manufacture's 
calibrated orifice and dry gas meter, corrected to standard conditions 
(pressure/temperature) dscm (dscf).
Y<INF>m</INF> = Dry gas meter calibration factor, (dimensionless).

    10.3.6 Y<INF>m</INF> Comparison. Compare the Y<INF>m</INF> value 
provided by the manufacturer (Section 10.3.3) or the pretest 
Y<INF>m</INF> value to the post test Y<INF>m</INF> value using the 
following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.581

    10.3.6.1 If this ratio is between 0.95 and 1.05, the designated 
Y<INF>m</INF> value for the meter is acceptable for use in later 
calculations.
    10.3.6.1.1 If the value is outside the specified range, the test 
series shall either be: 1)

[[Page 391]]

voided and the samples discarded; or 2) calculations for the test series 
shall be conducted using whichever meter coefficient value (i.e., 
manufacturers's/pretest Y<INF>m</INF> value or post test Y<INF>m</INF> 
value) produces the lowest sample volume.
    10.3.6.1.2 If the post test dry gas meter Y<INF>m</INF> value 
differs by more than 5% as compared to the pretest value, either perform 
the calibration again to determine acceptability or return the meter to 
the manufacturer for recalibration.
    10.3.6.1.3 The calibration may also be conducted as specified in 
Section 10.3 or Section 16.0 of Method 5 (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A), 
except that it is only necessary to check the calibration at one flow 
rate of  0.75 cfm.
    10.3.6.1.4 The calibration of the dry gas meter must be verified 
after each field test program using the same procedures.
    Note: The tester may elect to use the Y<INF>m</INF> post test value 
for the next pretest Y<INF>m</INF> value; e.g., Test 1 post test 
Y<INF>m</INF> value and Test 2 pretest Y<INF>m</INF> value would be the 
same.

    10.4 Barometer. Calibrate against a mercury barometer that has been 
corrected for temperature and elevation.
    10.5 ICP Spectrometer Calibration. Same as Method 306, Section 10.2.
    10.6 GFAA Spectrometer Calibration. Same as Method 306, Section 
10.3.
    10.7 IC/PCR Calibration. Same as Method 306, Section 10.4.

                       11.0 Analytical Procedures

    Note: The method determines the chromium concentration in [micro]g 
Cr/mL. It is important that the analyst measure the volume of the field 
sample prior to analyzing the sample. This will allow for conversion of 
[micro]g Cr/mL to [micro]g Cr/sample.

                         13.0 Method Performance

    13.1 Range. The recommended working range for all of the three 
analytical techniques starts at five times the analytical detection 
limit (see also Method 306, Section 13.2.2). The upper limit of all 
three techniques can be extended indefinitely by appropriate dilution.
    13.2 Sensitivity.
    13.2.1 Analytical Sensitivity. The estimated instrumental detection 
limits listed are provided as a guide for an instrumental limit. The 
actual method detection limits are sample and instrument dependent and 
may vary as the sample matrix varies.
    13.2.1.1 ICP Analytical Sensitivity. The minimum estimated detection 
limits for ICP, as reported in Method 6010A and the recently revised 
Method 6010B of SW-846 (Reference 1), are 7.0 [micro]g Cr/L and 4.7 
[micro]g Cr/L, respectively.
    13.2.1.2 GFAAS Analytical Sensitivity. The minimum estimated 
detection limit for GFAAS, as reported in Methods 7000A and 7191 of SW-
846 (Reference 1), is 1.0 [micro]g Cr/L.
    13.2.1.3 IC/PCR Analytical Sensitivity. The minimum detection limit 
for IC/PCR with a preconcentrator, as reported in Methods 0061 and 7199 
of SW-846 (Reference 1), is 0.05 [micro]g Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>/L.
    13.2.2 In-stack Sensitivity. The in-stack sensitivity depends upon 
the analytical detection limit, the volume of stack gas sampled, and the 
total volume of the impinger absorbing solution plus the rinses. Using 
the analytical detection limits given in Sections 13.2.1.1, 13.2.1.2, 
and 13.2.1.3; a stack gas sample volume of 1.7 dscm; and a total liquid 
sample volume of 500 mL; the corresponding in-stack detection limits are 
0.0014 mg Cr/dscm to 0.0021 mg Cr/dscm for ICP, 0.00029 mg Cr/dscm for 
GFAAS, and 0.000015 mg Cr<SUP>+36</SUP>/dscm for IC/PCR with 
preconcentration.
    Note: It is recommended that the concentration of Cr in the 
analytical solutions be at least five times the analytical detection 
limit to optimize sensitivity in the analyses. Using this guideline and 
the same assumptions for impinger sample volume and stack gas sample 
volume (500 mL and 1.7 dscm, respectively), the recommended minimum 
stack concentrations for optimum sensitivity are 0.0068 mg Cr/dscm to 
0.0103 mg Cr/dscm for ICP, 0.0015 mg Cr/dscm for GFAAS, and 0.000074 mg 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> dscm for IC/PCR with preconcentration. If required, the 
in-stack detection limits can be improved by either increasing the 
sampling time, the stack gas sample volume, reducing the volume of the 
digested sample for GFAAS, improving the analytical detection limits, or 
any combination of the three.

    13.3 Precision.
    13.3.1 The following precision data have been reported for the three 
analytical methods. In each case, when the sampling precision is 
combined with the reported analytical precision, the resulting overall 
precision may decrease.
    13.3.2 Bias data is also reported for GFAAS.
    13.4 ICP Precision.
    13.4.1 As reported in Method 6010B of SW-846 (Reference 1), in an 
EPA round-robin Phase 1 study, seven laboratories applied the ICP 
technique to acid/distilled water matrices that had been spiked with 
various metal concentrates. For true values of 10, 50, and 150 [micro]g 
Cr/L; the mean reported values were 10, 50, and 149 [micro]g Cr/L; and 
the mean percent relative standard deviations were 18, 3.3, and 3.8 
percent, respectively.
    13.4.2 In another multilaboratory study cited in Method 6010B, a 
mean relative standard of 8.2 percent was reported for an aqueous sample 
concentration of approximately 3750 [micro]g Cr/L.
    13.5 GFAAS Precision. As reported in Method 7191 of SW-846 
(Reference 1), in a single laboratory (EMSL), using Cincinnati, Ohio tap 
water spiked at concentrations of 19, 48, and 77 [micro]g Cr/L, the 
standard deviations were <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.1, <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.2, and <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.8, respectively. 
Recoveries at these levels were 97 percent, 101 percent, and 102 
percent, respectively.
    13.6 IC/PCR Precision. As reported in Methods 0061 and 7199 of SW-
846 (Reference 1), the precision of IC/PCR with sample preconcentration 
is 5 to 10 percent; the overall precision for sewage sludge incinerators 
emitting 120 ng/dscm of Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> and 3.5 [micro]g/dscm of total 
Cr is 25 percent and 9 percent, respectively; and for hazardous waste 
incinerators emitting 300 ng/dscm of Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> the precision is 20 
percent.

                        14.0 Pollution Prevention

    14.1 The only materials used in this method that could be considered 
pollutants are the chromium standards used for instrument calibration 
and acids used in the cleaning of the collection and measurement 
containers/labware, in the preparation of standards, and in the acid 
digestion of samples. Both reagents can be stored in the same waste 
container.
    14.2 Cleaning solutions containing acids should be prepared in 
volumes consistent with use to minimize the disposal of excessive 
volumes of acid.

[[Page 395]]

    14.3 To the extent possible, the containers/vessels used to collect 
and prepare samples should be cleaned and reused to minimize the 
generation of solid waste.

                          15.0 Waste Management

    15.1 It is the responsibility of the laboratory and the sampling 
team to comply with all federal, state, and local regulations governing 
waste management, particularly the discharge regulations, hazardous 
waste identification rules, and land disposal restrictions; and to 
protect the air, water, and land by minimizing and controlling all 
releases from field operations.

 Method 306B--Surface Tension Measurement for Tanks Used at Decorative 
        Chromium Electroplating and Chromium Anodizing Facilities

    Note: This method does not include all of the specifications (e.g., 
equipment and supplies) and procedures (e.g., sampling and analytical) 
essential to its performance. Some material is incorporated by reference 
from other methods in 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A and in this part. 
Therefore, to obtain reliable results, persons using this method should 
have a thorough knowledge of at least Methods 5 and 306.

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 Analyte. Not applicable.
    1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable to all decorative 
chromium plating and

[[Page 399]]

chromium anodizing operations, and continuous chromium plating at iron 
and steel facilities where a wetting agent is used in the tank as the 
primary mechanism for reducing emissions from the surface of the plating 
solution.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 During an electroplating or anodizing operation, gas bubbles 
generated during the process rise to the surface of the liquid and 
burst. Upon bursting, tiny droplets of chromic acid become entrained in 
ambient air. The addition of a wetting agent to the tank bath reduces 
the surface tension of the liquid and diminishes the formation of these 
droplets.
    2.2 This method determines the surface tension of the bath using a 
stalagmometer or a tensiometer to confirm that there is sufficient 
wetting agent present.

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    11.1 Procedure. The surface tension of the tank bath may be measured 
by using a tensiometer, a stalagmometer or any other equivalent surface 
tension measuring device approved by the Administrator for measuring 
surface tension in dynes per centimeter. If the tensiometer is used, the 
procedures specified in ASTM Method D 1331-89 must be followed. If a

instructions provided with the measuring device must be followed.
    11.2 Frequency of Measurements.
    11.2.1 Measurements of the bath surface tension are performed using 
a progressive system which decreases the frequency of surface tension 
measurements required when the proper surface tension is maintained.
    11.2.1.1 Initially, following the compliance date, surface tension 
measurements must be conducted once every 4 hours of tank operation for 
the first 40 hours of tank operation.
    11.2.1.2 Once there are no exceedances during a period of 40 hours 
of tank operation, measurements may be conducted once every 8 hours of 
tank operation.
    11.2.1.3 Once there are no exceedances during a second period of 40 
consecutive hours of tank operation, measurements may be conducted once 
every 40 hours of tank operation on an on-going basis, until an 
exceedance occurs. The maximum time interval for measurements is once 
every 40 hours of tank operation.
    11.2.2 If a measurement of the surface tension of the solution is 
above the 45 dynes per centimeter limit, or above an alternate surface 
tension limit established during the performance test, the time interval 
shall revert back to the original monitoring schedule of once every 4 
hours. A subsequent decrease in frequency would then be allowed 
according to Section 11.2.1.

    12.1.2 The measurements must be recorded in the log book. In 
addition to the record of surface tension measurements, the frequency of 
fume suppressant maintenance additions and the amount of fume 
suppressant added during each maintenance addition must be recorded in 
the log book.
    12.1.3 The log book will be readily available for inspection by 
regulatory personnel.

 Method 307--Determination of Emissions From Halogenated Solvent Vapor 
            Cleaning Machines Using a Liquid Level Procedure

                     1. Applicability and Principle

    1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable to the determination of 
the halogenated solvent emissions from solvent vapor cleaners in the 
idling mode.
    1.2 Principle. The solvent level in the solvent cleaning machine is 
measured using inclined liquid level indicators. The change in liquid 
level corresponds directly to the amount of solvent lost from the 
solvent cleaning machine.

                              2. Apparatus

    Note: Mention of trade names or specific products does not 
constitute endorsement by the Environmental Protection Agency.
    2.1 Inclined Liquid Level Indicator. A schematic of the inclined 
liquid level indicators used in this method is shown in figure 307-1; 
two inclined liquid level indicators having 0.05 centimeters divisions 
or smaller shall be used. The liquid level indicators shall be made of 
glass, Teflon, or any similar material that will not react with the 
solvent being used. A 6-inch by 1-inch slope is recommended; however the 
slope may vary depending on the size and design of the solvent cleaning 
machine.
    Note: It is important that the inclined liquid level indicators be 
constructed with ease of reading in mind. The inclined liquid level 
indicators should also be mounted so that they can be raised or lowered 
if necessary to suit the solvent cleaning machine size.

    2.2 Horizontal Indicator. Device to check the inclined liquid level 
indicators orientation relative to horizontal.
    2.3 Velocity Meter. Hotwire and vane anemometers, or other devices 
capable of measuring the flow rates ranging from 0 to 15.2 meters per 
minute across the solvent cleaning machine.

                              3. Procedure

    3.1 Connection of the Inclined Liquid Level Indicator. Connect one 
of the inclined liquid level indicators to the boiling sump drain and 
the other inclined liquid level indicator to the immersion sump drain 
using Teflon tubing and the appropriate fittings. A schematic diagram is 
shown in figure 307-2.

[[Page 401]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.076

    3.2 Positioning of Velocity Meter. Position the velocity meter so 
that it measures the flow rate of the air passing directly across the 
solvent cleaning machine.
    3.3 Level the Inclined Liquid Level Indicators.
    3.4 Initial Inclined Liquid Level Indicator Readings. Open the sump 
drainage valves. Allow the solvent cleaning machine to operate long 
enough for the vapor zone to form and the system to stabilize (check 
with manufacturer). Record the inclined liquid level indicators readings 
and the starting time on the data sheet. A sample data sheet is provided 
in figure 307-3.

the 16-hour test run, check to make sure the inclined liquid level 
indicators are level; if not, make the necessary adjustments. Record the 
final inclined liquid level indicators readings and time.
    3.6 Determination of Solvent Vapor/Air Interface Area for Each Sump.

    A gas sample is extracted from the sampling point in the stack. The 
methanol is collected in deionized distilled water and adsorbed on 
silica gel. The sample is returned to the laboratory where the methanol 
in the water fraction is separated from other organic compounds with a 
gas chromatograph (GC) and is then measured by a flame ionization 
detector (FID). The fraction adsorbed on silica gel is extracted with an 
aqueous solution of n-propanol and is then separated and measured by GC/
FID.

series of methanol standards by first pipetting 10 ml of the methanol 
working standard into a 100-ml volumetric flask and diluting the 
contents to exactly 100 ml with 3 percent n-propanol solution. This 
standard will contain 10 [micro]g/ml of methanol. Pipette 5, 15, and 25 
ml of this standard, respectively, into four 50-ml volumetric flasks. 
Dilute each solution to 50 ml with 3 percent n-propanol solution. These 
standards will have 1, 3, and 5 [micro]g/ml of methanol, respectively. 
Transfer all four standards into 40-ml glass vials capped with Teflon 
<SUP>[reg]</SUP>-lined septa and store under refrigeration. Discard any 
excess solution.
    7.2.4 GC Column. Capillary column, 30 meters (100 feet) long with an 
inside diameter (ID) of 0.53 mm (0.02 inch), coated with DB 624 to a 
film thickness of 3.0 micrometers, ([micro]m) or an equivalent column. 
Alternatively, a 30-meter capillary column coated with polyethylene 
glycol to a film thickness of 1 [micro]m such as AT-WAX or its 
equivalent.

                              8.0 Procedure

    8.1 Sampling. The following items are required for sampling:
    8.1.1 Preparation of Collection Train. Measure 20 ml of water into 
the midget impinger. The adsorbent tube must contain 520 mg of silica 
gel in the front section and 260 mg of silica gel in the backup section. 
Assemble the train as shown in Figure 308-1. An optional, second 
impinger that is left empty may be placed in front of the water-
containing impinger to act as a condensate trap. Place crushed ice and 
water around the impinger.

    8.1.2 Leak Check. A leak check prior to the sampling run is 
optional; however, a leak check after the sampling run is mandatory. The 
leak-check procedure is as follows:
    Temporarily attach a suitable (e.g., 0-to 40-ml/min) rotameter to 
the outlet of the DGM, and place a vacuum gauge at or near the probe 
inlet. Plug the probe inlet, pull a vacuum of at least 250 mm (10 inch) 
Hg, and note the flow rate as indicated by the rotameter. A leakage rate 
not in excess of 2 percent of the average sampling rate is acceptable.

    Note: Carefully release the probe inlet plug before turning off the 
pump.

    8.1.3 Sample Collection. Record the initial DGM reading and 
barometric pressure. To begin sampling, position the tip of the Teflon 
<SUP>[reg]</SUP> tubing at the sampling point, connect the tubing to the 
impinger, and start the pump. Adjust the sample flow to a constant rate 
between 200 and 1000 ml/min as indicated by the rotameter. Maintain this 
constant rate (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 percent) during the entire 
sampling run. Take readings (DGM, temperatures at DGM and at impinger 
outlet, and rate meter) at least every 5 minutes. Add more ice during 
the run to keep the temperature of the gases leaving the last impinger 
at 20 [deg]C (68 [deg]F) or less. At the conclusion of each run,

[[Page 405]]

turn off the pump, remove the Teflon <SUP>[reg]</SUP> tubing from the 
stack, and record the final readings. Conduct a leak check as in section 
8.1.2. (This leak check is mandatory.) If a leak is found, void the test 
run or use procedures acceptable to the Administrator to adjust the 
sample volume for the leakage.
    8.2 Sample Recovery. The following items are required for sample 
recovery:
    8.2.1 Impinger. Disconnect the impinger. Pour the contents of the 
midget impinger into a graduated cylinder. Rinse the midget impinger and 
the connecting tubes with water, and add the rinses to the graduated 
cylinder. Record the sample volume. Transfer the sample to a glass vial 
and cap with a Teflon <SUP>[reg]</SUP> septum. Discard any excess 
sample. Place the samples in an ice chest for shipment to the 
laboratory.
    8.2.2. Adsorbent Tubes. Seal the silica gel adsorbent tubes and 
place them in an ice chest for shipment to the laboratory.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 Miscellaneous Quality Control Measures. The following quality 
control measures are required:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    9.2 Applicability. When the method is used to analyze samples to 
demonstrate compliance with a source emission regulation, an audit 
sample must be analyzed, subject to availability.
    9.3 Audit Procedure. Analyze an audit sample with each set of 
compliance samples. Concurrently analyze the audit sample and a set of 
compliance samples in the same manner to evaluate the technique of the 
analyst and the standards preparation. The same analyst, analytical 
reagents, and analytical system shall be used both for the compliance 
samples and the EPA audit sample.
    9.4 Audit Sample Availability. Audit samples will be supplied only 
to enforcement agencies for compliance tests. Audit samples may be 
obtained by writing: Source Test Audit Coordinator (MD-77B), Air 
Measurement Research Division, National Exposure Research Laboratory, 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711; 
or by calling the Source Test Audit Coordinator (STAC) at (919) 541-
7834. The audit sample request must be made at least 30 days prior to 
the scheduled compliance sample analysis.
    9.5 Audit Results. Calculate the audit sample concentration 
according to the calculation procedure provided in the audit 
instructions included with the audit sample. Fill in the audit sample 
concentration and the analyst's name on the audit response form included 
with the audit instructions. Send one copy to the EPA Regional Office or 
the appropriate enforcement agency and a second copy to the STAC. The 
EPA Regional office or the appropriate enforcement agency will report 
the results of the audit to the laboratory being audited. Include this 
response with the results of the compliance samples in relevant reports 
to the EPA Regional Office or the appropriate enforcement agency.

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    10.1 Metering System. The following items are required for the 
metering system:
    10.1.1 Initial Calibration.
    10.1.1.1 Before its initial use in the field, first leak-check the 
metering system (drying tube, needle valve, pump, rotameter, and DGM) as 
follows: Place a vacuum gauge at the inlet to the drying tube, and pull 
a vacuum of 250 mm (10 inch) Hg; plug or pinch off the outlet of the 
flow meter, and then turn off the pump. The vacuum shall remain stable 
for at least 30 seconds. Carefully release the vacuum gauge before 
releasing the flow meter end.
    10.1.1.2 Next, remove the drying tube, and calibrate the metering 
system (at the sampling flow rate specified by the method) as follows: 
Connect an appropriately sized wet test meter (e.g., 1 liter per 
revolution (0.035 cubic feet per revolution)) to the inlet of the drying 
tube. Make three independent calibrations runs, using at least five 
revolutions of the DGM per run. Calculate the calibration factor, Y (wet 
test meter calibration volume divided by the DGM volume, both volumes 
adjusted to the same reference temperature and pressure), for each run, 
and average the results. If any Y-value deviates by more than 2 percent 
from the average, the metering system is unacceptable for use. 
Otherwise, use the average as the calibration factor for subsequent test 
runs.
    10.1.2 Posttest Calibration Check. After each field test series, 
conduct a calibration check as in section 10.1.1 above, except for the 
following variations: (a) The leak check is not to be conducted, (b) 
three, or more revolutions of the DGM may be used, and (c) only two 
independent runs need be made. If the calibration factor does not 
deviate by more than 5 percent from the initial calibration factor 
(determined in section 10.1.1), then the DGM volumes obtained during the 
test series are acceptable. If the calibration factor deviates by more 
than 5 percent, recalibrate the metering system as in section 10.1.1, 
and for the calculations, use the calibration factor (initial or 
recalibration) that yields the lower gas volume for each test run.
    10.1.3 Temperature Sensors. Calibrate against mercury-in-glass 
thermometers.

[[Page 406]]

    10.1.4 Rotameter. The rotameter need not be calibrated, but should 
be cleaned and maintained according to the manufacturer's instruction.
    10.1.5 Barometer. Calibrate against a mercury barometer.
    10.2 Gas Chromatograph. The following procedures are required for 
the gas chromatograph:
    10.2.1 Initial Calibration. Inject 1 [micro]l of each of the 
standards prepared in sections 7.2.3.3 and 7.2.3.4 into the GC and 
record the response. Repeat the injections for each standard until two 
successive injections agree within 5 percent. Using the mean response 
for each calibration standard, prepare a linear least squares equation 
relating the response to the mass of methanol in the sample. Perform the 
calibration before analyzing each set of samples.
    10.2.2 Continuing Calibration. At the beginning of each day, analyze 
the mid level calibration standard as described in section 10.5.1. The 
response from the daily analysis must agree with the response from the 
initial calibration within 10 percent. If it does not, the initial 
calibration must be repeated.

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    11.1 Gas Chromatograph Operating Conditions. The following operating 
conditions are required for the GC:
    11.1.1 Injector. Configured for capillary column, splitless, 200 
[deg]C (392 [deg]F).
    11.1.2 Carrier. Helium at 10 ml/min.
    11.1.3 Oven. Initially at 45 [deg]C for 3 minutes; then raise by 10 
[deg]C to 70 [deg]C; then raise by 70 [deg]C/min to 200 [deg]C.
    11.2 Impinger Sample. Inject 1 [micro]l of the stored sample into 
the GC. Repeat the injection and average the results. If the sample 
response is above that of the highest calibration standard, either 
dilute the sample until it is in the measurement range of the 
calibration line or prepare additional calibration standards. If the 
sample response is below that of the lowest calibration standard, 
prepare additional calibration standards. If additional calibration 
standards are prepared, there shall be at least two that bracket the 
response of the sample. These standards should produce approximately 50 
percent and 150 percent of the response of the sample.
    11.3 Silica Gel Adsorbent Sample. The following items are required 
for the silica gel adsorbent samples:
    11.3.1 Preparation of Samples. Extract the front and backup sections 
of the adsorbent tube separately. With a file, score the glass adsorbent 
tube in front of the first section of silica gel. Break the tube open. 
Remove and discard the glass wool. Transfer the first section of the 
silica gel to a 5-ml glass vial and stopper the vial. Remove the spacer 
between the first and second section of the adsorbent tube and discard 
it. Transfer the second section of silica gel to a separate 5-ml glass 
vial and stopper the vial.
    11.3.2 Desorption of Samples. Add 3 ml of the 10 percent n-propanol 
solution to each of the stoppered vials and shake or vibrate the vials 
for 30 minutes.
    11.3.3 Inject a 1-[micro]l aliquot of the diluted sample from each 
vial into the GC. Repeat the injection and average the results. If the 
sample response is above that of the highest calibration standard, 
either dilute the sample until it is in the measurement range of the 
calibration line or prepare additional calibration standards. If the 
sample response is below that of the lowest calibration standard, 
prepare additional calibration standards. If additional calibration 
standards are prepared, there shall be at least two that bracket the 
response of the sample. These standards should produce approximately 50 
percent and 150 percent of the response of the sample.

    1.1 Data Quality Objectives:
    In the production of ethylene-propylene terpolymer crumb rubber, the 
polymer is recovered from solution by flashing off the solvent with 
steam and hot water. The resulting water-crumb slurry is then pumped to 
the finishing units. Certain amounts of solvent (hexane being the most 
commonly used solvent) and diene monomer remain in the crumb. The 
analyst uses the following procedure to determine those amounts.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 The crumb rubber sample is dissolved in toluene to which heptane 
has been added as an internal standard. Acetone is then added to this 
solution to precipitate the crumb, and the supernatant is analyzed for 
hexane and diene by a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization 
detector (FID).

    4.3 2,2-dimethyl pentane, a minor component of the hexane used in 
our process, elutes just prior to methyl cyclopentane. It is included as 
``hexane'' in the analysis whether it is integrated separately or 
included in the methyl cyclopentane peak.

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 This procedure does not purport to address all of the safety 
concerns associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user 
of this procedure to establish appropriate safety and health practices 
and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
    5.2 Chemicals used in this analysis are flammable and hazardous (see 
specific toxicity information below). Avoid contact with sources of 
ignition during sample prep. All handling should be done beneath a hood. 
Playtex or nitrile gloves recommended.
    5.3 Hexane is toxic by ingestion and inhalation. Vapor inhalation 
causes irritation of nasal and respiratory passages, headache, 
dizziness, nausea, central nervous system depression. Chronic 
overexposure can cause severe nerve damage. May cause irritation on 
contact with skin or eyes. May cause damage to kidneys.
    5.4 Termonomer may be harmful by inhalation, ingestion, or skin 
absorption. Vapor or mist is irritating to the eyes, mucous membranes, 
and upper respiratory tract. Causes skin irritation.
    5.5 Toluene is harmful or fatal if swallowed. Vapor harmful if 
inhaled. Symptoms: headache, dizziness, hallucinations, distorted 
perceptions, changes in motor activity, nausea, diarrhea, respiratory 
irritation, central nervous system depression, unconsciousness, liver, 
kidney and lung damage. Contact can cause severe eye irritation. May 
cause skin irritation. Causes irritation of eyes, nose, and throat.

[[Page 410]]

    5.6 Acetone, at high concentrations or prolonged overexposure, may 
cause headache, dizziness, irritation of eyes and respiratory tract, 
loss of strength, and narcosis. Eye contact causes severe irritation; 
skin contact may cause mild irritation. Concentrations of 20,000 ppm are 
immediately dangerous to life and health.
    5.7 Heptane is harmful if inhaled or swallowed. May be harmful if 
absorbed through the skin. Vapor or mist is irritating to the eyes, 
mucous membranes, and upper respiratory tract. Prolonged or repeated 
exposure to skin causes defatting and dermatitis.
    5.8 The steam oven used to dry the polymer in this procedure is set

    7.5 Polymer Dissolving Solution (``PDS'')--Heptane (as internal 
standard) in toluene. This solution contains 0.3g of heptane internal 
standard per 100 ml of solution.
    7.5.1 Preparation of Polymer Dissolving Solution. Fill a 4,000-ml 
volumetric flask about \3/4\ full with toluene.
    7.5.2 Add 100 ml of the internal standard solution (section 7.4 of 
this method) to the flask using the 100ml pipette.
    7.5.3 Fill the flask to the mark with toluene. Discard any excess.
    7.5.4 Add a large magnetic stirring bar to the flask and mix by 
stirring.
    7.5.5 Transfer the polymer solvent solution to the one-gallon 
labeled container with 50ml volumetric dispenser attached.
    7.5.6 Purity Check: Analyze according to section 11.2. NOTE: You 
must ``precipitate'' the sample with an equal part of acetone (thus 
duplicating actual test conditions--see section 11.1 of this method, 
sample prep) before analyzing. Analyze the reagent 3 times to quantify 
the C<INF>6</INF> and termonomer interferences. Inspect the results to 
ensure good agreement among the three runs (within 10%).
    7.5.7 Tag the bottle with the following information:

     POLYMER DISSOLVING SOLUTION FOR C<INF>6</INF> IN CRUMB ANALYSIS
     PREPARER'S NAME
     DATE
     CALS FILE ID'S OF THE THREE ANALYSES FOR PURITY (from section 7.5.6 
of this method)

    7.6 Quality Control Solution: the quality control solution is 
prepared by adding specific amounts of mixed hexanes (barge hexane), n-
nonane and termonomer to some polymer dissolving solution. Nonane elutes 
in the same approximate time region as termonomer and is used to 
quantify in that region because it has a longer shelf life. Termonomer, 
having a high tendency to polymerize, is used in the QC solution only to 
ensure that both termonomer isomers elute at the proper time.
    First, a concentrated stock solution is prepared; the final QC 
solution can then be prepared by diluting the stock solution.
    7.6.1 In preparation of stock solution, fill a 1-liter volumetric 
flask partially with polymer dissolving solution (PDS)--see section 7.5 
of this method. Add 20.0 ml barge hexane, 5.0 ml n-nonane, and 3 ml 
termonomer. Finish filling the volumetric to the mark with PDS.
    7.6.2 In preparation of quality control solution, dilute the quality 
control stock solution (above) precisely 1:10 with PDS, i.e. 10 ml of 
stock solution made up to 100 ml (volumetric flask) with PDS. Pour the 
solution into a 4 oz. Boston round bottle and store in the refrigerator.

             8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation and Storage

    8.1 Line up facility to catch crumb samples. The facility is a 
special facility where the sample is drawn.
    8.1.1 Ensure that the cock valve beneath facility is closed.
    8.1.2 Line up the system from the slurry line cock valve to the cock 
valve at the nozzle on the stripper.
    8.1.3 Allow the system to flush through facility for a period of 30 
seconds.
    8.2 Catch a slurry crumb sample.
    8.2.1 Simultaneously close the cock valves upstream and downstream 
of facility.
    8.2.2 Close the cock valve beneath the slurry line in service.
    8.2.3 Line up the cooling tower water through the sample bomb water 
jacket to the sewer for a minimum of 30 minutes.
    8.2.4 Place the sample catching basket beneath facility and open the 
cock valve underneath the bomb to retrieve the rubber crumb.
    8.2.5 If no rubber falls by gravity into the basket, line up 
nitrogen to the bleeder upstream of the sample bomb and force the rubber 
into the basket.
    8.2.6 Close the cock valve underneath the sample bomb.
    8.3 Fill a plastic ``Whirl-pak'' sample bag with slurry crumb and 
send it to the lab immediately.
    8.4 Once the sample reaches the lab, it should be prepped as soon as 
possible to avoid hexane loss through evaporation. Samples which have 
lain untouched for more than 30 minutes should be discarded.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    Quality control is monitored via a computer program that tracks 
analyses of a prepared QC sample (from section 7.6.2 of this method). 
The QC sample result is entered daily into the program, which plots the 
result as a data point on a statistical chart. If the data point does 
not satisfy the ``in-control'' criteria (as defined by the lab quality 
facilitator), an ``out-of-control'' flag appears, mandating corrective 
action.
    In addition, the area of the n-heptane peak is monitored so that any 
errors in making up the polymer dissolving solution will be caught and 
corrected. Refer to section 12.4 of this method.

    9.1 Fill an autosampler vial with the quality control solution (from 
section 7.6.2 of this method) and analyze on the GC as normal (per 
section 11 of this method).
    9.2 Add the concentrations of the 5 hexane isomers as they appear on 
the CALS printout. Also include the 2,2-dimethyl-pentane peak just ahead 
of the methyl cyclopentane (the fourth major isomer) peak in the event 
that the peak integration split this peak out. Do not include the 
benzene peak in the sum.

[[Page 412]]

Note the nonane concentration. Record both results (total hexane and 
nonane) in the QC computer program. If out of control, and GC appears to 
be functioning within normal parameters, reanalyze a fresh control 
sample. If the fresh QC is not in control, check stock solution for 
contaminants or make up a new QC sample with the toluene currently in 
use. If instrument remains out-of-control, more thorough GC 
troubleshooting may be needed.
    Also, verify that the instrument has detected both isomers of 
termonomer (quantification not necessary--see section 7.0 of this 
method).
    9.3 Recovery efficiency must be determined for high ethylene 
concentration, low ethylene concentration, E-P terpolymer, or oil 
extended samples and whenever modifications are made to the method. 
Recovery shall be between 70 and 130 percent. All test results must be 
corrected by the recovery efficiency value (R).
    9.3.1 Approximately 10 grams of wet EPDM crumb (equivalent to about 
5 grams of dry rubber) shall be added to six sample bottles containing 
100 ml of hexane in crumb polymer dissolving solution (toluene 
containing 0.3 gram n-heptane/100 ml solution). The polymer shall be 
dissolved by agitating the bottles on a shaker for 4 hours. The polymer 
shall be precipitated using 100 ml acetone.
    9.3.2 The supernatant liquid shall be decanted from the polymer. 
Care shall be taken to remove as much of the liquid phase from the 
sample as possible to minimize the effect of retained liquid phase upon 
the next cycle of the analysis. The supernatant liquid shall be analyzed 
by gas chromatography using an internal standard quantitation method 
with heptane as the internal standard.
    9.3.3 The precipitated polymer from the steps described above shall 
be redissolved using toluene as the solvent. No heptane shall be added 
to the sample in the second dissolving step. The toluene solvent and 
acetone precipitant shall be determined to be free of interfering 
compounds.
    9.3.4 The rubber which was dissolved in the toluene shall be 
precipitated with acetone as before, and the supernatant liquid decanted 
from the precipitated polymer. The liquid shall be analyzed by gas 
chromatography and the rubber phase dried in a steam-oven to determine 
the final polymer weight.
    9.3.5 The ratios of the areas of the hexane peaks and of the heptane 
internal standard peak shall be calculated for each of the six samples 
in the two analysis cycles outlined above. The area ratios of the total 
hexane to heptane (R1) shall be determined for the two analysis cycles 
of the sample set. The ratio of the values of R1 from the second 
analysis cycle to the first cycle shall be determined to give a second 
ratio (R2).

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    The procedure for preparing a Quality Control sample with the 
internal standard in it is outlined in section 7.6 of this method.

    10.1 The relative FID response factors for n-heptane, the internal 
standard, versus the various hexane isomers and termonomer are 
relatively constant and should seldom need to be altered. However 
Baseline construction is a most critical factor in the production of 
good data. For this reason, close attention should be paid to peak 
integration. Procedures for handling peak integration will depend upon 
the data system used.
    10.2 If recalibration of the analysis is needed, make up a 
calibration blend of the internal standard and the analytes as detailed 
below and analyze it using the analytical method used for the samples.
    10.2.1 Weigh 5 g heptane into a tared scintillation vial to five 
places.
    10.2.2 Add 0.2 ml termonomer to the vial and reweigh.
    10.2.3 Add 0.5 ml hexane to the vial and reweigh.
    10.2.4 Cap, and shake vigorously to mix.
    10.2.5 Calculate the weights of termonomer and of hexane added and 
divide their weights by the weight of the n-heptane added. The result is 
the known of given value for the calibration.
    10.2.6 Add 0.4 ml of this mixture to a mixture of 100 ml toluene and 
100 ml of acetone. Cap and shake vigorously to mix.
    10.2.7 Analyze the sample.
    10.2.8 Divide the termonomer area and the total areas of the hexane 
peaks by the n-heptane area. This result is the ``found'' value for the 
calibration.
    10.2.9 Divide the appropriate ``known'' value from 10.2.5 by the 
found value from 10.2.8. The result is the response factor for the 
analyte in question. Previous work has shown that the standard deviation 
of the calibration method is about 1% relative.

                             11.0 Procedure

    11.1 SAMPLE PREPARATION
    11.1.1 Tare an 8oz sample bottle--Tag attached, cap off; record 
weight and sample ID on tag in pencil.
    11.1.2 Place crumb sample in bottle: RLA-3: 10 g (gives a dry wt. of 
5.5 g).
    11.1.3 Dispense 100ml of PDS into each bottle. SAMPLE SHOULD BE 
PLACED INTO SOLUTION ASAP TO AVOID HEXANE LOSS--Using ``Dispensette'' 
pipettor. Before dispensing, ``purge'' the dispensette (25% of its 
volume) into a waste bottle to eliminate any voids.
    11.1.4 Tightly cap bottles and load samples into shaker.
    11.1.5 Insure that ``ON-OFF'' switch on the shaker itself is ``ON.''
    11.1.6 Locate shaker timer. Insure that toggle switch atop timer 
control box is in

[[Page 413]]

the middle (``off'') position. If display reads ``04:00'' (4 hours), 
move toggle switch to the left position. Shaker should begin operating.
    11.1.7 After shaker stops, add 100 ml acetone to each sample to 
precipitate polymer. Shake minimum of 5 minutes on shaker--Vistalon 
sample may not have fully dissolved; nevertheless, for purposes of 
consistency, 4 hours is the agreed-upon dissolving time.
    11.1.8 Using a 5-ml glass Luer-lock syringe and Acrodisc filter, 
filter some of the supernatant liquid into an autosampler vial; crimp 
the vial and load it into the GC autosampler for analysis (section 11.2 
of this method)--The samples are filtered to prevent polymer buildup in 
the GC. Clean the syringes in toluene.
    11.1.9 Decant remaining supernatant into a hydrocarbon waste sink, 
being careful not to discard any of the polymer. Place bottle of 
precipitate into the steam oven and dry for six hours--Some grades of 
Vistalon produce very small particles in the precipitate, thus making 
complete decanting impossible without discarding some polymer. In this 
case, decant as much as possible and put into the oven as is, allowing 
the oven to drive off remaining supernatant (this practice is avoided 
for environmental reasons). WARNING: OVEN IS HOT--110 [deg]C (230 
[deg]F).
    11.1.10 Cool, weigh and record final weight of bottle.
    11.2 GC ANALYSIS
    11.2.1 Initiate the CALS computer channel.
    11.2.2 Enter the correct instrument method into the GC's integrator.
    11.2.3 Load sample vial(s) into autosampler.
    11.2.4 Start the integrator.
    11.2.5 When analysis is complete, plot CALS run to check baseline 
skim.

                   12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

    12.1 Add the concentrations of the hexane peaks as they appear on 
the CALS printout. Do not include the benzene peak in the sum.
    12.2 Subtract any hexane interferences found in the PDS (see section 
7.5.6 of this method); record the result.
    12.3 Note the termonomer concentration on the CALS printout. 
Subtract any termonomer interference found in the PDS and record this 
result in a ``% termonomer by GC'' column in a logbook.
    12.4 Record the area (from CALS printout) of the heptane internal 
standard peak in a ``C7 area'' column in the logbook. This helps track 
instrument performance over the long term.
    12.5 After obtaining the final dry weight of polymer used (Section 
11.1.10 of this method), record that result in a ``dry wt.'' column of 
the logbook (for oil extended polymer, the amount of oil extracted is 
added to the dry rubber weight).
    12.6 Divide the %C6 by the dry weight to obtain the total PHR hexane 
in crumb. Similarly, divide the % termonomer by the dry weight to obtain 
the total PHR termonomer in crumb. Note that PHR is an abbreviation for 
``parts per hundred''. Record both the hexane and termonomer results in 
the logbook.
    12.7 Correct all results by the recovery efficiency value (R).

                         13.0 Method Performance

    13.1 The method has been shown to provide 100% recovery of the 
hexane analyte. The method was found to give a 6% relative standard 
deviation when the same six portions of the same sample were carried 
through the procedure. Note: These values are examples; each sample 
type, as specified in Section 9.3, must be tested for sample recovery.

                        14.0 Pollution Prevention

    14.1 Dispose of all hydrocarbon liquids in the appropriate disposal 
sink system; never pour hydrocarbons down a water sink.
    14.2 As discussed in section 11.1.9 of this method, the analyst can 
minimize venting hydrocarbon vapor to the atmosphere by decanting as 
much hydrocarbon liquid as possible before oven drying.

                          15.0 Waste Management

    15.1 The Technician conducting the analysis should follow the proper 
waste management practices for their laboratory location.

 Method 310C--Determination of Residual N-Hexane in EPDM Rubber Through 
                           Gas Chromatography

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 This method describes a procedure for the determination of 
residual hexane in EPDM wet crumb rubber in the 0.01--2% range by 
solvent extraction of the hexane followed by gas chromatographic 
analysis where the hexane is detected by flame ionization and quantified 
via an internal standard.
    1.2 This method may involve hazardous materials operations and 
equipment. This method does not purport to address all the safety 
problems associated with it use, if any. It is the responsibility of the 
user to consult and establish appropriate safety and health practices 
and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.

[[Page 414]]

                               2.0 Summary

    2.1 Residual hexane contained in wet pieces of EPDM polymer is 
extracted with MIBK. A known amount of an internal standard (IS) is 
added to the extract which is subsequently analyzed via gas 
chromatography where the hexane and IS are separated and detected 
utilizing a megabore column and flame ionization detection (FID). From 
the response to the hexane and the IS, the amount of hexane in the EPDM 
polymer is calculated.

                             3.0 Definitions

    3.1 Hexane--refers to n-hexane
    3.2 Heptane--refers to n-heptane
    3.3 MIBK--methyl isobutyl ketone (4 methyl 2--Pentanone)

                            4.0 Interferences

    4.1 Material eluting at or near the hexane and/or the IS will cause 
erroneous results. Prior to extraction, solvent blanks must be analyzed 
to confirm the absence of interfering peaks.

                          8.0 Sample Collection

    8.1 Trap a sample of the EPDM crumb slurry in the sampling 
apparatus. Allow the crumb slurry to circulate through the sampling 
apparatus for 5 minutes; then close off the values at the bottom and top 
of the sampling apparatus, trapping the crumb slurry. Run cooling water 
through the water jacket for a minimum of 30 minutes. Expel the cooled 
crumb slurry into a sample catching basket. If the crumb does not fall 
by gravity, force it out with demineralized water or nitrogen. Send the 
crumb slurry to the lab for analysis.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 The Royalene crumb sample is extracted three times with MIBK 
containing an internal standard. The hexane from each extraction is 
added together to obtain a total hexane content. The percent hexane in 
the first extraction is then calculated and used as the recovery factor 
for the analysis.
    9.2 Follow this test method through section 11.4 of the method. 
After removing the sample of the first extraction to be run on the gas 
chromatograph, drain off the remainder of the extraction solvent, 
retaining the crumb sample in the sample jar. Rinse the crumb with 
demineralized water to remove any MIBK left on the surface of the crumb. 
Repeat the extraction procedure with fresh MIBK with internal standard 
two more times.
    9.3 After the third extraction, proceed to section 11.5 of this 
method and obtain the percent hexane in each extraction. Use the sample 
weight obtained in section 12.1 of this method to calculate the percent 
hexane in each of the extracts.
    9.4 Add the percent hexane obtained from the three extractions for a 
total percent hexane in the sample.
    9.5 Use the following equations to determine the recovery factor 
(R):
    % Recovery of the first extraction=(% hexane in the first extract/
total % hexane)x100
    Recovery Factor (R)=(% Hexane Recovered in the first extract)/100

                            10.0 Calibration

    10.1 Preparation of Internal Standard (IS) solution:

flask. Dilute to the mark with reagent grade MIBK. Label this Solution 
``A''. Pipette 100 mls. of Solution A into a 4 liter volumetric flask. 
Fill the flask to the mark with reagent MIBK. Label this Solution ``B''. 
Solution ``B'' will have a concentration of 0.75 mg/ml of heptane.
    10.2 Preparation of Hexane Standard Solution (HS):
    Using a 50 uL syringe, weigh by difference, 20 mg of n-hexane into a 
50 ml volumetric flask containing approximately 40 ml of Solution B. 
Fill the flask to the mark with Solution B and mix well.

[[Page 415]]


    Initial Time=5 minutes Final Time=6 minutes
    Flow Rate=5.0 ml/min
    Sensitivity=detector response must be adjusted to keep the hexane 
and IS on scale.
    10.4 Fill an autosampler vial with the HS, analyze it three times 
and calculate a Hexane Relative Response Factor (RF) as follows:

RF=(A<INF>IS</INF> x C<INF>HS</INF> x P<INF>HS</INF>)/(A<INF>HS</INF> x 
C<INF>IS</INF> x P<INF>IS</INF>) (1)

Where:

C<INF>HS</INF>=Mg of Hexane/50 ml HS
C<INF>IS</INF>=Mg of Heptane/50 ml IS Solution B
P<INF>IS</INF>=Purity of the IS n-heptane
P<INF>HS</INF>=Purity of the HS n-hexane

                             11.0 Procedure

    11.1 Weight 10 grams of wet crumb into a tared (W1), wide mouth 4 
oz. jar.
    11.2 Pipette 50 ml of Solution B into the jar with the wet crumb 
rubber.
    11.3 Screw the cap on tightly and place it on a shaker for 4 hours.
    11.4 Remove the sample from the shaker and fill an autosampler vial 
with the MIBK extract.
    11.5 Analyze the sample two times.
    11.6 Analyze the HS twice, followed by the samples. Inject the HS 
twice at the end of each 10 samples or at the end of the run.

                            12.0 Calculations

    12.1 Drain off the remainder of the MIBK extract from the polymer in 
the 4 oz. jar. Retain all the polymer in the jar. Place the uncovered 
jar and polymer in a heated vacuum oven until the polymer is dry. 
Reweigh the jar and polymer (W2) and calculate the dried sample weight 
of the polymer as follows:

    Dried SW=W2--W1 (2)

    12.2 Should the polymer be oil extended, pipette 10 ml of the MIBK 
extract into a tared evaporating dish (W1) and evaporate to dryness on a 
steam plate.
    Reweigh the evaporating dish containing the extracted oil (W2). 
Calculate the oil content of the polymer as follows:

    Gram of oil extracted =5 (W2--W1) (3)

% Hexane in polymer=(A<INF>s</INF>xRFxC<INF>IS</INF>xP<INF>IS</INF>)/
(A<INF>IS</INF>xSW) (4)

Method 311--Analysis of Hazardous Air Pollutant Compounds in Paints and 
          Coatings by Direct Injection Into a Gas Chromatograph

                        1. Scope and Application

    1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for determination of 
most compounds designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as 
volatile hazardous air pollutants (HAP's) (See Reference 1) that are 
contained in paints and coatings. Styrene, ethyl acrylate, and methyl 
methacrylate can be measured by ASTM D 4827-93 or ASTM D 4747-87. 
Formaldehyde can be measured by ASTM PS 9-94 or ASTM D 1979-91. Toluene 
diisocyanate can be measured in urethane prepolymers by ASTM D 3432-89. 
Method 311 applies only to those volatile HAP's which are added to the 
coating when it is manufactured, not to those which may form as the 
coating cures (reaction products or cure volatiles). A separate or 
modified test procedure must be used to measure these reaction products 
or cure volatiles in order to determine the total volatile HAP emissions 
from a coating. Cure volatiles are a significant component of the total 
HAP content of some coatings. The term ``coating'' used in this method 
shall be understood to mean paints and coatings.
    1.2 Principle. The method uses the principle of gas chromatographic 
separation and quantification using a detector that responds to 
concentration differences. Because there are many potential analytical 
systems or sets of operating conditions that may represent useable 
methods for determining the concentrations of the compounds cited in 
Section 1.1 in the applicable matrices, all systems that employ this 
principle, but differ only in details of equipment and operation, may be 
used as alternative methods, provided that the prescribed quality 
control, calibration, and method performance requirements are met. 
Certified product data sheets (CPDS) may also include information 
relevant to the analysis of the coating sample including, but not 
limited to, separation

[[Page 416]]

column, oven temperature, carrier gas, injection port temperature, 
extraction solvent, and internal standard.

                          2. Summary of Method

    Whole coating is added to dimethylformamide and a suitable internal 
standard compound is added. An aliquot of the sample mixture is injected 
onto a chromatographic column containing a stationary phase that 
separates the analytes from each other and from other volatile compounds 
contained in the sample. The concentrations of the analytes are 
determined by comparing the detector responses for the sample to the 
responses obtained using known concentrations of the analytes.

                        3. Definitions [Reserved]

                            4. Interferences

    4.1 Coating samples of unknown composition may contain the compound 
used as the internal standard. Whether or not this is the case may be 
determined by following the procedures of Section 11 and deleting the 
addition of the internal standard specified in Section 11.5.3. If 
necessary, a different internal standard may be used.
    4.2 The GC column and operating conditions developed for one coating 
formulation may not ensure adequate resolution of target analytes for 
other coating formulations. Some formulations may contain nontarget 
analytes that coelute with target analytes. If there is any doubt about 
the identification or resolution of any gas chromatograph (GC) peak, it 
may be necessary to analyze the sample using a different GC column or 
different GC operating conditions.
    4.3 Cross-contamination may occur whenever high-level and low-level 
samples are analyzed sequentially. The order of sample analyses 
specified in Section 11.7 is designed to minimize this problem.
    4.4 Cross-contamination may also occur if the devices used to 
transfer coating during the sample preparation process or for injecting 
the sample into the GC are not adequately cleaned between uses. All such 
devices should be cleaned with acetone or other suitable solvent and 
checked for plugs or cracks before and after each use.

                                5. Safety

    5.1 Many solvents used in coatings are hazardous. Precautions should 
be taken to avoid unnecessary inhalation and skin or eye contact. This 
method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This 
test method does not purport to address all of the safety problems 
associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this 
test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to 
determine the applicability of regulatory limitations in regards to the 
performance of this test method.
    5.2 Dimethylformamide is harmful if inhaled or absorbed through the 
skin. The user should obtain relevant health and safety information from 
the manufacturer. Dimethylformamide should be used only with adequate 
ventilation. Avoid contact with skin, eyes, and clothing. In case of 
contact, immediately flush skin or eyes with plenty of water for at 
least 15 minutes. If eyes are affected, consult a physician. Remove and 
wash contaminated clothing before reuse.
    5.3 User's manuals for the gas chromatograph and other related 
equipment should be consulted for specific precautions to be taken 
related to their use.

                        6. Equipment and Supplies

    Note: Certified product data sheets (CPDS) may also include 
information relevant to the analysis of the coating sample including, 
but not limited to, separation column, oven temperature, carrier gas, 
injection port temperature, extraction solvent, and internal standard.

    6.1 Sample Collection.
    6.1.1 Sampling Containers. Dual-seal sampling containers, four to 
eight fluid ounce capacity, should be used to collect the samples. Glass 
sample bottles or plastic containers with volatile organic compound 
(VOC) impermeable walls must be used for corrosive substances (e.g., 
etch primers and certain coating catalysts such as methyl ethyl ketone 
(MEK) peroxide). Sample containers, caps, and inner seal liners must be 
inert to the compounds in the sample and must be selected on a case-by-
case basis.
    6.1.1.1 Other routine sampling supplies needed include waterproof 
marking pens, tubing, scrappers/spatulas, clean rags, paper towels, 
cooler/ice, long handle tongs, and mixing/stirring paddles.
    6.1.2 Personal safety equipment needed includes eye protection, 
respiratory protection, a hard hat, gloves, steel toe shoes, etc.
    6.1.3 Shipping supplies needed include shipping boxes, packing 
material, shipping labels, strapping tape, etc.
    6.1.4 Data recording forms and labels needed include coating data 
sheets and sample can labels.

    Note: The actual requirements will depend upon the conditions 
existing at the source sampled.

    6.2 Laboratory Equipment and Supplies.
    6.2.1 Gas Chromatograph (GC). Any instrument equipped with a flame 
ionization detector and capable of being temperature programmed may be 
used. Optionally, other types of detectors (e.g., a mass spectrometer), 
and any necessary interfaces, may be used provided that the detector 
system

[[Page 417]]

yields an appropriate and reproducible response to the analytes in the 
injected sample. Autosampler injection may be used, if available.
    6.2.2 Recorder. If available, an electronic data station or 
integrator may be used to record the gas chromatogram and associated 
data. If a strip chart recorder is used, it must meet the following 
criteria: A 1 to 10 millivolt (mV) linear response with a full scale 
response time of 2 seconds or less and a maximum noise level of <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.03 percent of full scale. Other types of recorders may 
be used as appropriate to the specific detector installed provided that 
the recorder has a full scale response time of 2 seconds or less and a 
maximum noise level of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.03 percent of full scale.
    6.2.3 Column. The column must be constructed of materials that do 
not react with components of the sample (e.g., fused silica, stainless 
steel, glass). The column should be of appropriate physical dimensions 
(e.g., length, internal diameter) and contain sufficient suitable 
stationary phase to allow separation of the analytes. DB-5, DB-Wax, and 
FFAP columns are commonly used for paint analysis; however, it is the 
responsibility of each analyst to select appropriate columns and 
stationary phases.
    6.2.4 Tube and Tube Fittings. Supplies to connect the GC and gas 
cylinders.
    6.2.5 Pressure Regulators. Devices used to regulate the pressure 
between gas cylinders and the GC.
    6.2.6 Flow Meter. A device used to determine the carrier gas flow 
rate through the GC. Either a digital flow meter or a soap film bubble 
meter may be used to measure gas flow rates.
    6.2.7 Septa. Seals on the GC injection port through which liquid or 
gas samples can be injected using a syringe.
    6.2.8 Liquid Charging Devices. Devices used to inject samples into 
the GC such as clean and graduated 1, 5, and 10 microliter ([micro]l) 
capacity syringes.
    6.2.9 Vials. Containers that can be sealed with a septum in which 
samples may be prepared or stored. The recommended size is 25 ml 
capacity. Mininert <SUP>[reg]</SUP> valves have been found satisfactory 
and are available from Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, Illinois.
    6.2.10 Balance. Device used to determine the weights of standards 
and samples. An analytical balance capable of accurately weighing to 
0.0001 g is required.

                        7. Reagents and Standards

    7.1 Purity of Reagents. Reagent grade chemicals shall be used in all 
tests. Unless otherwise specified, all reagents shall conform to the 
specifications of the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American 
Chemical Society, where such specifications are available. Other grades 
may be used provided it is first ascertained that the reagent is of 
sufficient purity to permit its use without lessening the accuracy of 
determination.
    7.2 Carrier Gas. Helium carrier gas shall have a purity of 99.995 
percent or higher. High purity nitrogen may also be used. Other carrier 
gases that are appropriate for the column system and analyte may also be 
used. Ultra-high purity grade hydrogen gas and zero-grade air shall be 
used for the flame ionization detector.
    7.3 Dimethylformamide (DMF). Solvent for all standards and samples. 
Some other suitable solvent may be used if DMF is not compatible with 
the sample or coelutes with a target analyte.

    Note: DMF may coelute with ethylbenzene or p-xylene under the 
conditions described in the note under Section 6.2.3.

    7.4 Internal Standard Materials. The internal standard material is 
used in the quantitation of the analytes for this method. It shall be 
gas chromatography spectrophotometric quality or, if this grade is not 
available, the highest quality available. Obtain the assay for the 
internal standard material and maintain at that purity during use. The 
recommended internal standard material is 1-propanol; however, selection 
of an appropriate internal standard material for the particular coating 
and GC conditions used is the responsibility of each analyst.
    7.5 Reference Standard Materials. The reference standard materials 
are the chemicals cited in Section 1.1 which are of known identity and 
purity and which are used to assist in the identification and 
quantification of the analytes of this method. They shall be the highest 
quality available. Obtain the assays for the reference standard 
materials and maintain at those purities during use.
    7.6 Stock Reference Standards. Stock reference standards are 
dilutions of the reference standard materials that may be used on a 
daily basis to prepare calibration standards, calibration check 
standards, and quality control check standards. Stock reference 
standards may be prepared from the reference standard materials or 
purchased as certified solutions.
    7.6.1 Stock reference standards should be prepared in 
dimethylformamide for each analyte expected in the coating samples to be 
analyzed. The concentrations of analytes in the stock reference 
standards are not specified but must be adequate to prepare the 
calibration standards required in the method. A stock reference standard 
may contain more than one analyte provided all analytes are chemically 
compatible and no analytes coelute. The actual concentrations prepared 
must be known to within 0.1 percent (e.g., 0.1000 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.0001 g/g solution). The following procedure is 
suggested. Place about 35 ml of dimethylformamide into a tared

[[Page 418]]

ground-glass stoppered 50 ml volumetric flask. Weigh the flask to the 
nearest 0.1 mg. Add 12.5 g of the reference standard material and 
reweigh the flask. Dilute to volume with dimethylformamide and reweigh. 
Stopper the flask and mix the contents by inverting the flask several 
times. Calculate the concentration in grams per gram of solution from 
the net gain in weights, correcting for the assayed purity of the 
reference standard material.

    Note: Although a glass-stoppered volumetric flask is convenient, any 
suitable glass container may be used because stock reference standards 
are prepared by weight.

    7.6.2 Transfer the stock reference standard solution into one or 
more Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottles. Store, with minimal headspace, at 
-10 [deg]C to 0 [deg]C and protect from light.
    7.6.3 Prepare fresh stock reference standards every six months, or 
sooner if analysis results from daily calibration check standards 
indicate a problem. Fresh stock reference standards for very volatile 
HAP's may have to be prepared more frequently.
    7.7 Calibration Standards. Calibration standards are used to 
determine the response of the detector to known amounts of reference 
material. Calibration standards must be prepared at a minimum of three 
concentration levels from the stock reference standards (see Section 
7.6). Prepare the calibration standards in dimethylformamide (see 
Section 7.3). The lowest concentration standard should contain a 
concentration of analyte equivalent either to a concentration of no more 
than 0.01% of the analyte in a coating or to a concentration that is 
lower than the actual concentration of the analyte in the coating, 
whichever concentration is higher. The highest concentration standard 
should contain a concentration of analyte equivalent to slightly more 
than the highest concentration expected for the analyte in a coating. 
The remaining calibration standard should contain a concentration of 
analyte roughly at the midpoint of the range defined by the lowest and 
highest concentration calibration standards. The concentration range of 
the standards should thus correspond to the expected range of analyte 
concentrations in the prepared coating samples (see Section 11.5). Each 
calibration standard should contain each analyte for detection by this 
method expected in the actual coating samples (e.g., some or all of the 
compounds listed in Section 1.1 may be included). Each calibration 
standard should also contain an appropriate amount of internal standard 
material (response for the internal standard material is within 25 to 75 
percent of full scale on the attenuation setting for the particular 
reference standard concentration level). Calibration Standards should be 
stored for 1 week only in sealed vials with minimal headspace. If the 
stock reference standards were prepared as specified in Section 7.6, the 
calibration standards may be prepared by either weighing each addition 
of the stock reference standard or by adding known volumes of the stock 
reference standard and calculating the mass of the standard reference 
material added. Alternative 1 (Section 7.7.1) specifies the procedure to 
be followed when the stock reference standard is added by volume. 
Alternative 2 (Section 7.7.2) specifies the procedure to be followed 
when the stock reference standard is added by weight.

    Note: To assist with determining the appropriate amount of internal 
standard to add, as required here and in other sections of this method, 
the analyst may find it advantageous to prepare a curve showing the area 
response versus the amount of internal standard injected into the GC.

    7.7.1 Preparation Alternative 1. Determine the amount of each stock 
reference standard and dimethylformamide solvent needed to prepare 
approximately 25 ml of the specific calibration concentration level 
desired. To a tared 25 ml vial that can be sealed with a crimp-on or 
Mininert <SUP>[reg]</SUP> valve, add the total amount of 
dimethylformamide calculated to be needed. As quickly as practical, add 
the calculated amount of each stock reference standard using new pipets 
(or pipet tips) for each stock reference standard. Reweigh the vial and 
seal it. Using the known weights of the standard reference materials per 
ml in the stock reference standards, the volumes added, and the total 
weight of all reagents added to the vial, calculate the weight percent 
of each standard reference material in the calibration standard 
prepared. Repeat this process for each calibration standard to be 
prepared.
    7.7.2 Preparation Alternative 2. Determine the amount of each stock 
reference standard and dimethylformamide solvent needed to prepare 
approximately 25 ml of the specific calibration concentration level 
desired. To a tared 25 ml vial that can be sealed with a crimp-on or 
Mininert <SUP>[reg]</SUP> valve, add the total amount of 
dimethylformamide calculated to be needed. As quickly as practical, add 
the calculated amount of a stock reference standard using a new pipet 
(or pipet tip) and reweigh the vial. Repeat this process for each stock 
reference standard to be added. Seal the vial after obtaining the final 
weight. Using the known weight percents of the standard reference 
materials in the stock reference standards, the weights of the stock 
reference standards added, and the total weight of all reagents added to 
the vial, calculate the weight percent of each standard reference 
material in the calibration standard prepared. Repeat this process for 
each calibration standard to be prepared.

[[Page 419]]

       8. Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage

    8.1 Copies of material safety data sheets (MSDS's) for each sample 
should be obtained prior to sampling. The MSDS's contain information on 
the ingredients, and physical and chemical properties data. The MSDS's 
also contain recommendations for proper handling or required safety 
precautions. Certified product data sheets (CPDS) may also include 
information relevant to the analysis of the coating sample including, 
but not limited to, separation column, oven temperature, carrier gas, 
injection port temperature, extraction solvent, and internal standard.
    8.2 A copy of the blender's worksheet can be requested to obtain 
data on the exact coating being sampled. A blank coating data sheet form 
(see Section 18) may also be used. The manufacturer's formulation 
information from the product data sheet should also be obtained.
    8.3 Prior to sample collection, thoroughly mix the coating to ensure 
that a representative, homogeneous sample is obtained. It is preferred 
that this be accomplished using a coating can shaker or similar device; 
however, when necessary, this may be accomplished using mechanical 
agitation or circulation systems.
    8.3.1 Water-thinned coatings tend to incorporate or entrain air 
bubbles if stirred too vigorously; mix these types of coatings slowly 
and only as long as necessary to homogenize.
    8.3.2 Each component of multicomponent coatings that harden when 
mixed must be sampled separately. The component mix ratios must be 
obtained at the facility at the time of sampling and submitted to the 
analytical laboratory.
    8.4 Sample Collection. Samples must be collected in a manner that 
prevents or minimizes loss of volatile components and that does not 
contaminate the coating reservoir. A suggested procedure is as follows. 
Select a sample collection container which has a capacity at least 25 
percent greater than the container in which the sample is to be 
transported. Make sure both sample containers are clean and dry. Using 
clean, long-handled tongs, turn the sample collection container upside 
down and lower it into the coating reservoir. The mouth of the sample 
collection container should be at approximately the midpoint of the 
reservoir (do not take the sample from the top surface). Turn the sample 
collection container over and slowly bring it to the top of the coating 
reservoir. Rapidly pour the collected coating into the sample container, 
filling it completely. It is important to fill the sample container 
completely to avoid any loss of volatiles due to volatilization into the 
headspace. Return any unused coating to the reservoir or dispose as 
appropriate.

    Note: If a company requests a set of samples for its own analysis, a 
separate set of samples, using new sample containers, should be taken at 
the same time.

    8.5 Once the sample is collected, place the sample container on a 
firm surface and insert the inner seal in the container by placing the 
seal inside the rim of the container, inverting a screw cap, and 
pressing down on the screw cap which will evenly force the inner seal 
into the container for a tight fit. Using clean towels or rags, remove 
all residual coating material from the outside of the sample container 
after inserting the inner seal. Screw the cap onto the container.
    8.5.1 Affix a sample label (see Section 18) clearly identifying the 
sample, date collected, and person collecting the sample.
    8.5.2 Prepare the sample for transportation to the laboratory. The 
sample should be maintained at the coating's recommended storage 
temperature specified on the Material Safety Data Sheet, or, if no 
temperature is specified, the sample should be maintained within the 
range of 5 [deg]C to 38 [deg]C.
    8.9 The shipping container should adhere to U.S. Department of 
Transportation specification DOT 12-B. Coating samples are considered 
hazardous materials; appropriate shipping procedures should be followed.

                           9. Quality Control

    9.1 Laboratories using this method should operate a formal quality 
control program. The minimum requirements of the program should consist 
of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing 
analysis of blanks and quality control samples to evaluate and document 
quality data. The laboratory must maintain records to document the 
quality of the data generated. When results indicate atypical method 
performance, a quality control check standard (see Section 9.4) must be 
analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-
control mode of operation.
    9.2 Before processing any samples, the analyst must demonstrate, 
through analysis of a reagent blank, that there are no interferences 
from the analytical system, glassware, and reagents that would bias the 
sample analysis results. Each time a set of analytical samples is 
processed or there is a change in reagents, a reagent blank should be 
processed as a safeguard against chronic laboratory contamination. The 
blank samples should be carried through all stages of the sample 
preparation and measurement steps.
    9.3 Required instrument quality control parameters are found in the 
following sections:
    9.3.1 Baseline stability must be demonstrated to be <=5 percent of 
full scale using the procedures given in Section 10.1.

[[Page 420]]

    9.3.2 The GC calibration is not valid unless the retention time (RT) 
for each analyte at each concentration is within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.05 min of the retention time measured for that analyte 
in the stock standard.
    9.3.3 The retention time (RT) of any sample analyte must be within 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.05 min of the average RT of the analyte in the 
calibration standards for the analyte to be considered tentatively 
identified.
    9.3.4 The GC system must be calibrated as specified in Section 10.2.
    9.3.5 A one-point daily calibration check must be performed as 
specified in Section 10.3.
    9.4 To establish the ability to generate results having acceptable 
accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following 
operations.
    9.4.1 Prepare a quality control check standard (QCCS) containing 
each analyte expected in the coating samples at a concentration expected 
to result in a response between 25 percent and 75 percent of the limits 
of the calibration curve when the sample is prepared as described in 
Section 11.5. The QCCS may be prepared from reference standard materials 
or purchased as certified solutions. If prepared in the laboratory, the 
QCCS must be prepared independently from the calibration standards.
    9.4.2 Analyze three aliquots of the QCCS according to the method 
beginning in Section 11.5.3 and calculate the weight percent of each 
analyte using Equation 1, Section 12.
    9.4.3 Calculate the mean weight percent (X) for each analyte from 
the three results obtained in Section 9.4.2.
    9.4.4 Calculate the percent accuracy for each analyte using the 
known concentrations (Ti) in the QCCS using Equation 3, Section 12.
    9.4.5 Calculate the percent relative standard deviation (percent 
RSD) for each analyte using Equation 7, Section 12, substituting the 
appropriate values for the relative response factors (RRF's) in said 
equation.
    9.4.6 If the percent accuracy (Section 9.4.4) for all analytes is 
within the range 90 percent to 110 percent and the percent RSD (Section 
9.4.5) for all analytes is <=20 percent, system performance is 
acceptable and sample analysis may begin. If these criteria are not met 
for any analyte, then system performance is not acceptable for that 
analyte and the test must be repeated for those analytes only. Repeated 
failures indicate a general problem with the measurement system that 
must be located and corrected. In this case, the entire test, beginning 
at Section 9.4.1, must be repeated after the problem is corrected.
    9.5 Great care must be exercised to maintain the integrity of all 
standards. It is recommended that all standards be stored at -10 [deg]C 
to 0 [deg]C in screw-cap amber glass bottles with Teflon liners.
    9.6 Unless otherwise specified, all weights are to be recorded 
within 0.1 mg.

                  10. Calibration and Standardization.

    10.1 Column Baseline Drift. Before each calibration and series of 
determinations and before the daily calibration check, condition the 
column using procedures developed by the laboratory or as specified by 
the column supplier. Operate the GC at initial (i.e., before sample 
injection) conditions on the lowest attenuation to be used during sample 
analysis. Adjust the recorder pen to zero on the chart and obtain a 
baseline for at least one minute. Initiate the GC operating cycle that 
would be used for sample analysis. On the recorder chart, mark the pen 
position at the end of the simulated sample analysis cycle. Baseline 
drift is defined as the absolute difference in the pen positions at the 
beginning and end of the cycle in the direction perpendicular to the 
chart movement. Calculate the percent baseline drift by dividing the 
baseline drift by the chart width representing full-scale deflection and 
multiply the result by 100.
    10.2 Calibration of GC. Bring all stock standards and calibration 
standards to room temperature while establishing the GC at the 
determined operating conditions.
    10.2.1 Retention Times (RT's) for Individual Compounds.

    Note: The procedures of this subsection are required only for the 
initial calibration. However, it is good laboratory practice to follow 
these procedures for some or all analytes before each calibration. The 
procedures were written for chromatograms output to a strip chart 
recorder. More modern instruments (e.g., integrators and electronic data 
stations) determine and print out or display retention times 
automatically.

    The RT for each analyte should be determined before calibration. 
This provides a positive identification for each peak observed from the 
calibration standards. Inject an appropriate volume (see Note in Section 
11.5.2) of one of the stock reference standards into the gas 
chromatograph and record on the chart the pen position at the time of 
the injection (see Section 7.6.1). Dilute an aliquot of the stock 
reference standard as required in dimethylformamide to achieve a 
concentration that will result in an on-scale response. Operate the gas 
chromatograph according to the determined procedures. Select the peak(s) 
that correspond to the analyte(s) [and internal standard, if used] and 
measure the retention time(s). If a chart recorder is used, measure the 
distance(s) on the chart from the injection point to the peak maxima. 
These distances, divided by the chart speed, are defined as the RT's of 
the analytes in question. Repeat this process for each of the stock 
reference standard solutions.


[[Page 421]]


    Note: If gas chromatography with mass spectrometer detection (GC-MS) 
is used, a stock reference standard may contain a group of analytes, 
provided all analytes are adequately separated during the analysis. Mass 
spectral library matching can be used to identify the analyte associated 
with each peak in the gas chromatogram. The retention time for the 
analyte then becomes the retention time of its peak in the chromatogram.

    10.2.2 Calibration. The GC must be calibrated using a minimum of 
three concentration levels of each potential analyte. (See Section 7.7 
for instructions on preparation of the calibration standards.) Beginning 
with the lowest concentration level calibration standard, carry out the 
analysis procedure as described beginning in Section 11.7. Repeat the 
procedure for each progressively higher concentration level until all 
calibration standards have been analyzed.
    10.2.2.1 Calculate the RT's for the internal standard and for each 
analyte in the calibration standards at each concentration level as 
described in Section 10.2.1. The RT's for the internal standard must not 
vary by more than 0.10 minutes. Identify each analyte by comparison of 
the RT's for peak maxima to the RT's determined in Section 10.2.1.
    10.2.2.2 Compare the retention times (RT's) for each potential 
analyte in the calibration standards for each concentration level to the 
retention times determined in Section 10.2.1. The calibration is not 
valid unless all RT's for all analytes meet the criteria given in 
Section 9.3.2.
    10.2.2.3 Tabulate the area responses and the concentrations for the 
internal standard and each analyte in the calibration standards. 
Calculate the response factor for the internal standard 
(RF<INF>is</INF>) and the response factor for each compound relative to 
the internal standard (RRF) for each concentration level using Equations 
5 and 6, Section 12.
    10.2.2.4 Using the RRF's from the calibration, calculate the percent 
relative standard deviation (percent RSD) for each analyte in the 
calibration standard using Equation 7, Section 12. The percent RSD for 
each individual calibration analyte must be less than 15 percent. This 
criterion must be met in order for the calibration to be valid. If the 
criterion is met, the mean RRF's determined above are to be used until 
the next calibration.
    10.3 Daily Calibration Checks. The calibration curve (Section 
10.2.2) must be checked and verified at least once each day that samples 
are analyzed. This is accomplished by analyzing a calibration standard 
that is at a concentration near the midpoint of the working range and 
performing the checks in Sections 10.3.1, 10.3.2, and 10.3.3.
    10.3.1 For each analyte in the calibration standard, calculate the 
percent difference in the RRF from the last calibration using Equation 
8, Section 12. If the percent difference for each calibration analyte is 
less than 10 percent, the last calibration curve is assumed to be valid. 
If the percent difference for any analyte is greater than 5 percent, the 
analyst should consider this a warning limit. If the percent difference 
for any one calibration analyte exceeds 10 percent, corrective action 
must be taken. If no source of the problem can be determined after 
corrective action has been taken, a new three-point (minimum) 
calibration must be generated. This criterion must be met before 
quantitative analysis begins.
    10.3.2 If the RF<INF>is</INF> for the internal standard changes by 
more than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>20 percent from the last daily 
calibration check, the system must be inspected for malfunctions and 
corrections made as appropriate.
    10.3.3 The retention times for the internal standard and all 
calibration check analytes must be evaluated. If the retention time for 
the internal standard or for any calibration check analyte changes by 
more than 0.10 min from the last calibration, the system must be 
inspected for malfunctions and corrections made as required.

                              11. Procedure

    11.1 All samples and standards must be allowed to warm to room 
temperature before analysis. Observe the given order of ingredient 
addition to minimize loss of volatiles.
    11.2 Bring the GC system to the determined operating conditions and 
condition the column as described in Section 10.1.

    Note: The temperature of the injection port may be an especially 
critical parameter. Information about the proper temperature may be 
found on the CPDS.

    11.3 Perform the daily calibration checks as described in Section 
10.3. Samples are not to be analyzed until the criteria in Section 10.3 
are met.
    11.4 Place the as-received coating sample on a paint shaker, or 
similar device, and shake the sample for a minimum of 5 minutes to 
achieve homogenization.
    11.5 Note: The steps in this section must be performed rapidly and 
without interruption to avoid loss of volatile organics. These steps 
must be performed in a laboratory hood free from solvent vapors. All 
weights must be recorded to the nearest 0.1 mg.
    11.5.1 Add 16 g of dimethylformamide to each of two tared vials (A 
and B) capable of being septum sealed.
    11.5.2 To each vial add a weight of coating that will result in the 
response for the major constituent being in the upper half of the linear 
range of the calibration curve.

    Note: The magnitude of the response obviously depends on the amount 
of sample injected into the GC as specified in Section 11.8. This volume 
must be the same as used

[[Page 422]]

for preparation of the calibration curve, otherwise shifts in compound 
retention times may occur. If a sample is prepared that results in a 
response outside the limits of the calibration curve, new samples must 
be prepared; changing the volume injected to bring the response within 
the calibration curve limits is not permitted.

    11.5.3 Add a weight of internal standard to each vial (A and B) that 
will result in the response for the internal standard being between 25 
percent and 75 percent of the linear range of the calibration curve.
    11.5.4 Seal the vials with crimp-on or Mininert <SUP>[reg]</SUP> 
septum seals.
    11.6 Shake the vials containing the prepared coating samples for 60 
seconds. Allow the vials to stand undisturbed for ten minutes. If solids 
have not settled out on the bottom after 10 minutes, then centrifuge at 
1,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The analyst also has the option of injecting 
the sample without allowing the solids to settle.
    11.7 Analyses should be conducted in the following order: daily 
calibration check sample, method blank, up to 10 injections from sample 
vials (i.e., one injection each from up to five pairs of vials, which 
corresponds to analysis of 5 coating samples).
    11.8 Inject the prescribed volume of supernatant from the 
calibration check sample, the method blank, and the sample vials onto 
the chromatographic column and record the chromatograms while operating 
the system under the specified operating conditions.
    Note: The analyst has the option of injecting the unseparated 
sample.

                   12. Data Analysis and Calculations

    12.1 Qualitative Analysis. An analyte (e.g., those cited in Section 
1.1) is considered tentatively identified if two criteria are satisfied: 
(1) elution of the sample analyte within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.05 min 
of the average GC retention time of the same analyte in the calibration 
standard; and (2) either (a) confirmation of the identity of the 
compound by spectral matching on a gas chromatograph equipped with a 
mass selective detector or (b) elution of the sample analyte within 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.05 min of the average GC retention time of the 
same analyte in the calibration standard analyzed on a dissimilar GC 
column.
    12.1.1 The RT of the sample analyte must meet the criteria specified 
in Section 9.3.3.
    12.1.2 When doubt exists as to the identification of a peak or the 
resolution of two or more components possibly comprising one peak, 
additional confirmatory techniques (listed in Section 12.1) must be 
used.
    12.2 Quantitative Analysis. When an analyte has been identified, the 
quantification of that compound will be based on the internal standard 
technique.
    12.2.1 A single analysis consists of one injection from each of two 
sample vials (A and B) prepared using the same coating. Calculate the 
concentration of each identified analyte in the sample as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.003

    12.2.2 Report results for duplicate analysis (sample vials A and B) 
without correction.
    12.3 Precision Data. Calculate the percent difference between the 
measured concentrations of each analyte in vials A and B as follows.
    12.3.1 Calculate the weight percent of the analyte in each of the 
two sample vials as described in Section 12.2.1.
    12.3.2 Calculate the percent difference for each analyte as:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.004
    

[[Page 423]]


where A<INF>i</INF> and B<INF>i</INF> are the measured concentrations of 
the analyte in vials A and B.
    12.4 Calculate the percent accuracy for analytes in the QCCS (See 
Section 9.4) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.005

where X<INF>x</INF> is the mean measured value and T<INF>x</INF> is the 
known true value of the analyte in the QCCS.
    12.5 Obtain retention times (RT's) from data station or integrator 
or, for chromatograms from a chart recorder, calculate the RT's for 
analytes in the calibration standards (See Section 10.2.2.2) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.006

    12.6 Calculate the response factor for the internal standard (See 
Section 10.2.2.3) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.007

where:
    A<INF>is</INF> = Area response of the internal standard.
    C<INF>is</INF> = Weight percent of the internal standard.
    12.7 Calculate the relative response factors for analytes in the 
calibration standards (See Section 10.2.2.3) as follows:
where:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.008

    RRF<INF>x</INF> = Relative response factor for an individual 
analyte.
    A<INF>x</INF> = Area response of the analyte being measured.
    C<INF>x</INF> = Weight percent of the analyte being measured.
    12.8 Calculate the percent relative standard deviation of the 
relative response factors for analytes in the calibration standards (See 
Section 10.2.2.4) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.009

    12.9 Calculate the percent difference in the relative response 
factors between the calibration curve and the daily calibration checks 
(See Section 10.3) as follows:

                          16. Waste Management

    16.1 The coating samples and laboratory standards and reagents may 
contain compounds which require management as hazardous waste. It is the 
laboratory's responsibility to ensure all wastes are managed in 
accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.
    16.2 To avoid excessive laboratory waste, obtain only enough sample 
for laboratory analysis.
    16.3 It is recommended that discarded waste coating solids, used 
rags, used paper towels, and other nonglass or nonsharp waste materials 
be placed in a plastic bag before disposal. A separate container, 
designated ``For Sharp Objects Only,'' is recommended for collection of 
discarded glassware and other sharp-edge items used in the laboratory. 
It is recommended that unused or excess samples and reagents be placed 
in a solvent-resistant plastic or metal container with a lid or cover 
designed for flammable liquids. This container should not be stored in 
the area where analytical work is performed. It is recommended that a 
record be kept of all compounds placed in the container for 
identification of the contents upon disposal.

number n.
S<INF>n</INF>=theoretical concentration of compound spiked into sample 
n.
    9.3.4 A value of R between 0.70 and 1.30 is acceptable.

mean styrene value shall be determined, along with the standard 
deviation, and the percent relative standard deviation.
    9.5 The six samples of the spiked solution shall be coagulated and

methyl styrene analyzed by this method is within the range of .00121g to 
.00129g.

                              8.0 Sampling

    8.1 Collect a latex sample in a capped container. Cap the bottle and 
identify the sample as to location and time.
    8.2 Deliver sample to Laboratory for testing within one hour.
    8.3 Laboratory will test within two hours.
    8.4 No special storage conditions are required.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 The laboratory is required to operate a formal quality control 
program. This consists of an initial demonstration of the capability of 
the method as well as ongoing analysis of standards, blanks, and spiked 
samples to demonstrate continued performance.
    9.1.1 When the method is first set up, a calibration is run and the 
recovery efficiency for each type of sample must be determined.
    9.1.2 If new types of samples are being analyzed, then recovery 
efficiency for each new type of sample must be determined. New type 
includes any change, such as polymer type, physical form or a 
significant change in the composition of the matrix.
    9.2 Recovery efficiency must be determined once for each sample type 
and whenever modifications are made to the method.
    9.2.1 In determining the recovery efficiency, the quadruplet 
sampling system shall be used. Six sets of samples (for a total of 24) 
shall be taken. In each quadruplet set, half of the samples (two out of 
the four) shall be spiked with styrene.
    9.2.2 Prepare the samples as described in section 8 of this method. 
To the vials labeled ``spiked'', add a known amount of styrene that is 
expected to be present in the latex.
    9.2.3 Run the spiked and unspiked samples in the normal manner. 
Record the concentrations of styrene reported for each pair of spiked 
and unspiked samples with the same vial number.
    9.2.4 For each hydrocarbon, calculate the average recovery 
efficiency (R) using the following equation:

R=[Sigma](R<INF>n</INF>)/12

Where: n = sample number
R<INF>n</INF>=(M<INF>s</INF>-M<INF>u</INF>)/S
M<INF>s</INF>=total mass of compound (styrene) measured in spiked sample 
([micro]g)
M<INF>u</INF>=total mass of compound (styrene) measured in unspiked 
sample ([micro]g)
S=theoretical mass of compound (styrene) spiked into sample ([micro]g)
R=fraction of spiked compound (styrene) recovered

    9.2.5 A different R value should be obtained for each sample type. A 
value of R between 0.70 and 1.30 is acceptable.
    9.2.6 R is used to correct all reported results for each compound by 
dividing the measured results of each compound by the R for that 
compound for the same sample type.

                            10.0 Calibration

    A styrene control sample will be tested weekly to confirm the FID 
response and calibration.

    10.1 Using the Styrene Certification Solution prepared in 7.8.1, 
perform test analysis as described in 7.8.2 using the equation in 
7.8.2.3 to calculate results.
    10.2 Calculate the weight of styrene in the styrene control sample 
using the following equation:

W<INF>sty</INF>=(F<INF>x</INF> xA<INF>sty</INF> 
xW<INF>is</INF>)A<INF>is</INF>

    The instrument can be considered calibrated if the weight of the 
styrene analyzed is within range of 0.00097-0.00103gms.

                             11.0 Procedure

    11.1 Using an auto pipet, add 25ml of Internal Standard Solution to 
a 4 oz. wide-mouth bottle.
    11.2 Using a calibrated auto pipet, add 5.0 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.01g latex to the bottle containing the 25ml of 
Internal Standard Solution.
    11.3 Cap the bottle and place on the wrist action shaker. Shake the 
sample for a minimum of five minutes using the timer on the shaker. 
Remove from shaker.
    11.4 Using a disposable pipet, fill the 2ml sample vial with the 
clear alcohol extract. (If the extract is not clear, it should be 
filtered using a funnel and filter paper.) Cap and seal the vial.
    11.5 Place the sample in the autosampler tray and start the GC and 
Integrator. The sample will be injected into the GC by the auto-
injector, and the Integrator will print the results.
    11.6 Gas Chromatograph Conditions

                            12.0 Calculations

    12.1 The integrator is programmed to do the following calculation at 
the end of the analysis:

%ResidualStyrene=(A<INF>x</INF> XW<INF>is</INF>)/(A<INF>is</INF> 
XW<INF>x</INF>)XF<INF>x</INF> X100

Where:
A<INF>x</INF>=Peak area of styrene
A<INF>is</INF>=Peak area of internal standard

[[Page 435]]

W<INF>x</INF>=Weight of sample = 5g
W<INF>is</INF>=Weight of internal std. = 0.00125g
F<INF>x</INF>=Analyzed response factor = 1.0

    12.2 The response factor is determined by analyzing a solution of 
0.02g of styrene and 0.02g of alpha methyl styrene in 100ml of 2-
propanol. Calculate the factor by the following equation:

F<INF>x</INF>=(W<INF>x</INF> xA<INF>is</INF>)/(W<INF>is</INF> 
xA<INF>x</INF>)

Where:
W<INF>x</INF>=Weight of styrene
A<INF>x</INF>=Peak area of styrene
W<INF>is</INF>=Weight of alpha methyl styrene
A<INF>is</INF>=Peak area of alpha methyl styrene

                         13.0 Method Performance

    13.1 Performance must be determined for each sample type by 
following the procedures in section 9 of this method.

   Method 313A--Determination of Residual Hydrocarbons in Rubber Crumb

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 This method determines residual toluene and styrene in stripper 
crumb of the of the following types of rubber: polybutadiene (PBR) and 
styrene/butadiene rubber (SBR), both derived from solution 
polymerization processes that utilize toluene as the polymerization 
solvent.
    1.2 The method is applicable to a wide range of concentrations of 
toluene and styrene provided that calibration standards cover the 
desired range. It is applicable at least over the range of 0.01 to 10.0 
% residual toluene and from 0.1 to 3.0 % residual styrene. It is 
probably applicable over a wider range, but this must be verified prior 
to use.
    1.3 The method may also be applicable to other process samples as 
long as they are of a similar composition to stripper crumb. See section 
3.1 of this method for a description of stripper crumb.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 The wet crumb is placed in a sealed vial and run on a headspace 
sampler which heats the vial to a specified temperature for a specific 
time and then injects a known volume of vapor into a capillary GC. The 
concentration of each component in the vapor is proportional to the 
level of that component in the crumb sample and does not depend on water 
content of the crumb.
    2.2 Identification of each component is performed by comparing the 
retention times to those of known standards.
    2.3 Results are calculated by the external standard method since 
injections are all performed in an identical manner. The response for 
each component is compared with that obtained from dosed samples of 
crumb.
    2.4 Measured results of each compound are corrected by dividing each 
by the average recovery efficiency determined for the same compound in 
the same sample type.

                             3.0 Definitions

    3.1 Stripper crumb refers to pieces of rubber resulting from the 
steam stripping of a toluene solution of the same polymer in a water 
slurry. The primary component of this will be polymer with lesser 
amounts of entrained water and residual toluene and other hydrocarbons. 
The amounts of hydrocarbons present must be such that the crumb is a 
solid material, generally less that 10 % of the dry rubber weight.

                            4.0 Interferences

    4.1 Contamination is not normally a problem since samples are sealed 
into vials immediately on sampling.
    4.2 Cross contamination in the headspace sampler should not be a 
problem if the correct sampler settings are used. This should be 
verified by running a blank sample immediately following a normal or 
high sample. Settings may be modified if necessary if this proves to be 
a problem, or a blank sample may be inserted between samples.
    4.3 Interferences may occur if volatile hydrocarbons are present 
which have retention times close to that of the components of interest. 
Since the solvent makeup of the processes involved are normally fairly 
well defined this should not be a problem. If it is found to be the 
case, switching to a different chromatographic column will probably 
resolve the situation.

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 The chemicals specified in this method should all be handled 
according to standard laboratory practices as well as any special 
precautions that may be listed in the MSDS for that compound.
    5.2 Sampling of strippers or other process streams may involve high 
pressures and temperatures or may have the potential for exposure to 
chemical fumes. Only personnel who have been trained in the specific 
sampling procedures required for that process should perform this 
operation. An understanding of the process involved is necessary. Proper 
personal protective equipment should be worn. Any sampling devices 
should be inspected prior to use. A detailed sampling

[[Page 436]]

procedure which specifies exactly how to obtain the sample must be 
written and followed.

    7.2 Styrene, 99.9+% purity, HPLC grade.
    7.3 Dry rubber of same type as the stripper crumb samples.

             8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation and Storage

    8.1 Collect a sample of crumb in a manner appropriate for the 
process equipment being sampled.
    8.1.1 If conditions permit, this may be done by passing a stream of 
the crumb slurry through a strainer, thus separating the crumb from the 
water. Allow the water to drain freely, do not attempt to squeeze any 
water from the crumb. Results will not depend on the exact water content 
of the samples. Immediately place several pieces of crumb directly into 
a headspace vial. This should be done with rubber gloves to protect the 
hands from both the heat and from contact with residual hydrocarbons. 
The vial should be between \1/4\ and \1/3\ full. Results do not depend 
on sample size as long as there is sufficient sample to reach an 
equilibrium vapor pressure in the headspace of the vial. Cap and seal 
the vial. Prepare each sample at least in duplicate. This is to minimize 
the effect of the variation that naturally occurs in the composition of 
non homogeneous crumb. The free water is not analyzed by this method and 
should be disposed of appropriately along with any unused rubber crumb.
    8.1.2 Alternatively the process can be sampled in a specially 
constructed sealed bomb which can then be transported to the laboratory. 
The bomb is then cooled to ambient temperature by applying a stream of 
running water. The bomb can then be opened and the crumb separated from 
the water and the vials filled as described in section 8.1.1 of this 
method. The bomb may be stored up to 8 hours prior to transferring the 
crumb into vials.
    8.2 The sealed headspace vials may be run immediately or may be 
stored up to 72 hours prior to running. It is possible that even longer 
storage times may be acceptable, but this must be verified for the 
particular type of sample being analyzed (see section 9.2.3 of this 
method). The main concern here is that some types of rubber eventually 
may flow, thus compacting the crumb so that the surface area is reduced. 
This may have some effect on the headspace equilibration.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 The laboratory is required to operate a formal quality control 
program. This consists of an initial demonstration of the capability of 
the method as well as ongoing analysis of standards, blanks and spiked 
samples to demonstrate continued performance.
    9.1.1 When the method is first set up a calibration is run 
(described in section 10 of this method) and an initial demonstration of 
method capability is performed (described in section 9.2 of this 
method). Also recovery efficiency for each type of sample must be 
determined (see section 9.4 of this method).
    9.1.2 It is permissible to modify this method in order to improve 
separations or make other improvements, provided that all performance 
specifications are met. Each time a modification to the method is made 
it is necessary to repeat the calibration (section 10 of this method), 
the demonstration of method performance (section 9.2 of this method) and 
the recovery efficiency for each type of sample (section 9.4 of this 
method).
    9.1.3 Ongoing performance should be monitored by running a spiked 
rubber standard. If this test fails to demonstrate that the analysis is 
in control, then corrective action must be taken. This method is 
described in section 9.3 of this method.
    9.1.4 If new types of samples are being analyzed then recovery 
efficiency for each new type of sample must be determined. New type 
includes any change, such as polymer

[[Page 437]]

type, physical form or a significant change in the composition of the 
matrix.
    9.2 Initial demonstration of method capability to establish the 
accuracy and precision of the method. This is to be run following the 
calibration described in section 10 of this method.
    9.2.1 Prepare a series of identical spiked rubber standards as 
described in section 9.3 of this method. A sufficient number to 
determine statistical information on the test should be run. Ten may be 
a suitable number, depending on the quality control methodology used at 
the laboratory running the tests. These are run in the same manner as 
unknown samples (see section 11 of this method).
    9.2.2 Determine mean and standard deviation for the results. Use 
these to determine the capability of the method and to calculate 
suitable control limits for the ongoing performance check which will 
utilize the same standards.
    9.2.3 Prepare several additional spiked rubber standards and run 2 
each day to determine the suitability of storage of the samples for 24, 
48 and 72 hours or longer if longer storage times are desired.
    9.3 A spiked rubber standard should be run on a regular basis to 
verify system performance. This would probably be done daily if samples 
are run daily. This is prepared in the same manner as the calibration 
standards (section 10.1 of this method), except that only one 
concentration of toluene and styrene is prepared. Choose concentrations 
of toluene and styrene that fall in the middle of the range expected in 
the stripper crumb and then do not change these unless there is a major 
change in the composition of the unknowns. If it becomes necessary to 
change the composition of this standard the initial performance 
demonstration must be repeated with the new standard (section 9.2 of 
this method).
    9.3.1 Each day prepare one spiked rubber standard to be run the 
following day. The dry rubber may be prepared in bulk and stored for any 
length of time consistent with the shelf life of the product. The 
addition of water and hydrocarbons must be performed daily and all the 
steps described under section 10.1 of this method must be followed.
    9.3.2 Run the spiked rubber standard prepared the previous day. 
Record the results and plot on an appropriate control chart or other 
means of determining statistical control.
    9.3.3 If the results for the standard indicate that the test is out 
of control then corrective action must be taken. This may include a 
check on procedures, instrument settings, maintenance or recalibration. 
Samples may be stored (see section 8.2 of this method) until compliance 
is demonstrated.
    9.4 Recovery efficiency must be determined once for each sample type 
and whenever modifications are made to the method.
    9.4.1 For each sample type collect 12 samples from the process 
(section 8.1 of this method). This should be done when the process is 
operating in a normal manner and residual hydrocarbon levels are in the 
normal range. Half the vials and caps should be tared, labeled 
``spiked'' and numbered 1 through 6. The other vials are labeled 
``unspiked'' and need not be tared but are also numbered 1 through 6. 
Immediately on sampling, the vials should be capped to prevent loss of 
volatiles. Allow all the samples to cool completely to ambient 
temperature. Reweigh each of the vials labeled ``spiked'' to determine 
the weight of wet crumb inside.
    9.4.2 The dry weight of rubber present in the wet crumb is estimated 
by multiplying the weight of wet crumb by the fraction of nonvolatiles 
typical for the sample. If this is not known, an additional quantity of 
crumb may be sampled, weighed, dried in an oven and reweighed to 
determine the fraction of volatiles and nonvolatiles prior to starting 
this procedure.
    9.4.3 To the vials labeled ``spiked'' add an amount of a mixture of 
toluene and styrene that is between 40 and 60 % of the amount expected 
in the crumb. This is done by removing the cap, adding the mixture by 
syringe, touching the tip of the needle to the sample in order to remove 
the drop and then immediately recapping the vials. The mixture is not 
added through the septum, because a punctured septum may leak and vent 
vapors as the vial is heated. The weights of toluene and styrene added 
may be calculated from the volumes of the mixture added, its composition 
and density, or may be determined by the weight of the vials and caps 
prior to and after addition. The exact dry weight of rubber present and 
the concentration of residual toluene and styrene are not known at this 
time so an exact calculation of the concentration of hydrocarbons is not 
possible until the test is completed.
    9.4.4 Place all the vials onto a shaker or tumbler for 24 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 hours. This is essential in order for the hydrocarbons 
to be evenly distributed and completely absorbed into the rubber. If 
this is not followed the toluene and styrene will be mostly at the 
surface of the rubber and high results will be obtained.
    9.4.5 Remove the vials from the shaker and tap them so that all the 
crumb settles to the bottom of the vials. Allow them to stand for 1 hour 
prior to analysis to allow any liquid to drain fully to the bottom.
    9.4.6 Run the spiked and unspiked samples in the normal manner. 
Record the concentrations of toluene and styrene reported for each pair 
of spiked and unspiked samples with the same vial number.
    9.4.7 Open each of the vials labeled ``spiked'', remove all the 
rubber crumb and

[[Page 438]]

place it into a tarred drying pan. Place in a 100 deg C oven for two 
hours, cool and reweigh. Subtract the weight of the tare to give the dry 
weight of rubber in each spiked vial. Calculate the concentration of 
toluene and styrene spiked into each vial as percent of dry rubber 
weight. This will be slightly different for each vial since the weights 
of dry rubber will be different.
    9.4.8 For each hydrocarbon calculate the average recovery efficiency 
(R) using the following equations:

R=R--[Sigma](P<INF>n</INF>)/6 (average of the 6 individual R<INF>n</INF> 
values)

Where:
R<INF>n</INF>=(C<INF>ns</INF>--C<INF>nu)</INF> / S<INF>n</INF>

Where:
n=vial number
Cns=concentration of compound measured in spiked sample number n.
Cnu=concentration of compound measured in unspiked sample number n.
Sn=theoretical concentration of compound spiked into sample n calculated 
in step 9.4.7

    9.4.9 A different R value should be obtained for each compound 
(styrene and toluene) and for each sample type.
    9.4.10 A value of R between 0.70 and 1.30 is acceptable.
    9.4.11 R is used to correct all reported results for each compound 
by dividing the measured results of each compound by the R for that 
compound for the same sample type (see section 12.2 of this method.)

                            10.0 Calibration

    10.1 Calibration standards are prepared by dosing known amounts of 
the hydrocarbons of interest into vials containing known amounts of 
rubber and water.
    10.1.1 Cut a sufficient quantity of dry rubber of the same type as 
will be analyzed into pieces about the same size as that of the crumb. 
Place these in a single layer on a piece of aluminum foil or other 
suitable surface and place into a forced air oven at 100 [deg]C for four 
hours. This is to remove any residual hydrocarbons that may be present. 
This step may be performed in advance.
    10.1.2 Into each of a series of vials add 3.0 g of the dry rubber.
    10.1.3 Into each vial add 1.0 ml distilled water or an amount that 
is close to the amount that will be present in the unknowns. The exact 
amount of water present does not have much effect on the analysis, but 
it is necessary to have a saturated environment. The water will also aid 
in the uniform distribution of the spiked hydrocarbons over the surface 
of the rubber after the vials are placed on the shaker (in step 10.1.5 
of this method).
    10.1.4 Into each vial add varying amounts of toluene and styrene by 
microliter syringe and cap the vials immediately to prevent loss. The 
tip of the needle should be carefully touched to the rubber in order to 
transfer the last drop to the rubber. Toluene and styrene may first be 
mixed together in suitable proportions and added together if desired. 
The weights of toluene and styrene added may be calculated from the 
volumes of the mixture added, its composition and density, or may be 
determined by the weight of the vials and caps prior to and after 
addition. Concentrations of added hydrocarbons are calculated as percent 
of the dry rubber weight. At least 5 standards should be prepared with 
the amounts of hydrocarbons added being calculated to cover the entire 
range possible in the unknowns. Retain two samples with no added 
hydrocarbons as blanks.
    10.1.5 Place all the vials onto a shaker or tumbler for 24 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 hours. This is essential in order for the hydrocarbons 
to be evenly distributed and completely absorbed into the rubber. If 
this is not followed the toluene and styrene will be mostly at the 
surface of the rubber and high results will be obtained.
    10.1.6 Remove the vials from the shaker and tap them so that all the 
crumb settles to the bottom of the vials. Allow them to stand for 1 hour 
prior to analysis to allow any liquid to drain fully to the bottom.
    10.2 Run the standards and blanks in the same manner as described 
for unknowns (section 11 of this method), starting with a blank, then in 
order of increasing hydrocarbon content and ending with the other blank.
    10.3 Verify that the blanks are sufficiently free from toluene and 
styrene or any interfering hydrocarbons.
    10.3.1 It is possible that trace levels may be present even in dry 
product. If levels are high enough that they will interfere with the 
calibration then the drying procedure in section 10.1.1 of this method 
should be reviewed and modified as needed to ensure that suitable 
standards can be prepared.
    10.3.2 It is possible that the final blank is contaminated by the 
previous standard. If this is the case review and modify the sampler 
parameters as needed to eliminate this problem. If necessary it is 
possible to run blank samples between regular samples in order to reduce 
this problem, though it should not be necessary if the sampler is 
properly set up.
    10.4 Enter the amounts of toluene and styrene added to each of the 
samples (as calculated in section 10.1.4 of this method) into the 
calibration table and perform a calibration utilizing the external 
standard method of analysis.
    10.5 At low concentrations the calibration should be close to 
linear. If a wide range of levels are to be determined it may be 
desirable to apply a nonlinear calibration to get the best fit.

[[Page 439]]

                             11.0 Procedure

    11.1 Place the vials in the tray of the headspace sampler. Enter the 
starting and ending positions through the console of the sampler. For 
unknown samples each is run in duplicate to minimize the effect of 
variations in crumb composition. If excessive variation is noted it may 
be desirable to run more than two of each sample.
    11.2 Make sure the correct method is loaded on the Chemstation. Turn 
on the gas flows and light the FID flame.
    11.3 Start the sequence on the Chemstation. Press the START button 
on the headspace unit. The samples will be automatically injected after 
equilibrating for 30 minutes in the oven. As each sample is completed 
the Chemstation will calculate and print out the results as percent 
toluene and styrene in the crumb based on the dry weight of rubber.

                   12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

    12.1 For each set of duplicate samples calculate the average of the 
measured concentration of toluene and styrene. If more than two 
replicates of each sample are run calculate the average over all 
replicates.
    12.2 For each sample correct the measured amounts of toluene and 
styrene using the following equation:

Corrected Result = C<INF>m</INF>/R

Where:
C<INF>m</INF> = Average measured concentration for that compound.
R = Recovery efficiency for that compound in the same sample type (see 
section 9.4 of this method)

    12.3 Report the recovery efficiency (R) and the corrected results of 
toluene and styrene for each sample.

                         13.0 Method Performance

    13.1 This method can be very sensitive and reproducible. The actual 
performance depends largely on the exact nature of the samples being 
analyzed. Actual performance must be determined by each laboratory for 
each sample type.
    13.2 The main source of variation is the actual variation in the 
composition of non homogeneous crumb in a stripping system and the small 
sample sizes employed here. It therefore is the responsibility of each 
laboratory to determine the optimum number of replicates of each sample 
required to obtain accurate results.

                        14.0 Pollution Prevention

    14.1 Samples should be kept sealed when possible in order to prevent 
evaporation of hydrocarbons.
    14.2 When drying of samples is required it should be done in an oven 
which vents into a suitable device that can trap the hydrocarbons 
released.
    14.3 Dispose of samples as described in section 15.

                          15.0 Waste Management

    15.1 Excess stripper crumb and water as well as the contents of the 
used sample vials should be properly disposed of in accordance with 
local and federal regulations.
    15.2 Preferably this will be accomplished by having a system of 
returning unused and spent samples to the process.

                Polymers by Capillary Gas Chromatography

                                1.0 Scope

    1.1 This method is applicable to solution polymerized polybutadiene 
(PBD).
    1.2 This method quantitatively determines n-hexane in wet crumb 
polymer at levels from 0.08 to 0.15% by weight.
    1.3 This method may be extended to the determination of other 
hydrocarbons in solution produced polymers with proper experimentation 
and documentation.

                         2.0 Principle of Method

    2.1 A weighed sample of polymer is dissolved in chloroform and the 
cement is coagulated with an isopropyl alcohol solution containing a 
specific amount of alpha-methyl styrene (AMS) as the internal standard. 
The extract of this coagulation is then injected into a gas 
chromatograph and separated into individual components. Quantification 
is achieved by the method of internal standardization.

collected in the sampling basket.
    8.4 One pound of crumb rubber sample is placed into a polyethylene 
bag. The bag is labeled with the time, date and sample location.
    8.5 The sample should be delivered to the laboratory for testing 
within one hour of sampling.
    8.6 Laboratory testing will be done within 3 hours of the sampling 
time.
    8.7 No special storage conditions are required unless the storage 
time exceeds 3 hours in which case refrigeration of the samples is 
recommended.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 For each sample type, 12 samples shall be obtained from the 
process for the recovery study. Half of the vials and caps shall be 
tared, labeled ``spiked'', and numbered 1 through 6. The other vials 
shall be labeled ``unspiked'' and need not be tared, but are also 
numbered 1 through 6.
    9.2 Determine the % moisture content of the crumb sample. After 
determining the % moisture content, the correction factor for 
calculating the dry crumb weight can be determined by using the equation 
in section 12.2 of this method.

[[Page 441]]

    9.3 Run the spiked and unspiked samples in the normal manner. Record 
the concentrations of the n-hexane content of the mixed hexane reported 
for each pair of spiked and unspiked samples.
    9.4 For the recovery study, each sample of crumb shall be dissolved 
in chloroform containing a known amount of mixed hexane solvent.
    9.5 For each hydrocarbon, calculate the recovery efficiency (R) 
using the following equations:

M<INF>r</INF>=M<INF>s</INF>-M<INF>u</INF>
R=M<INF>r</INF>/S

Where:
M<INF>u</INF>=Measured amount of compound in the unspiked sample
M<INF>s</INF>=Measured amount of compound in the spiked sample
M<INF>r</INF>=Measured amount of the spiked compound
S=Amount of compound added to the spiked sample
R=Fraction of spiked compound recovered

    9.6 Normally a value of R between 0.70 and 1.30 is acceptable.
    9.7 R is used to correct all reported results for each compound by 
dividing the measured results of each compound by the R for that 
compound for the same sample type.

of the n-HEXANE STOCK SOLUTION (7.6.2 of this method) into the 50-ml 
serum vial and cap. This solution will be labeled the CALIBRATION 
SOLUTION.
    10.3 Using the conditions prescribed (6.6 of this method), inject 1 
[micro]l of the supernate.
    10.4 Obtain the peak areas and calculate the response factor as 
described in the calculations section (12.1 of this method).

  Extractable Matter (MCEM) From Selected Sources at Primary Aluminum 
                          Production Facilities

    Note: This method does not include all of the specifications (e.g., 
equipment and supplies) and procedures (e.g., sampling and analytical) 
essential to its performance. Some material is incorporated by reference 
from other methods in this part. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, 
persons using this method should have a thorough knowledge of at least 
the following additional test methods: Method 1, Method 2, Method 3, and 
Method 5 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 Analytes. Particulate matter (PM). No CAS number assigned. 
Methylene chloride extractable matter (MCEM). No CAS number assigned.
    1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the simultaneous 
determination of PM and MCEM when specified in an applicable regulation. 
This method was developed by consensus with the Aluminum Association and 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and has limited precision 
estimates for MCEM; it should have similar precision to Method 5 for PM 
in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A since the procedures are similar for PM.
    1.3 Data quality objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this 
method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant 
sampling methods.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    Particulate matter and MCEM are withdrawn isokinetically from the 
source. PM is collected on a glass fiber filter maintained at a 
temperature in the range of 120 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>14 [deg]C (248 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>25 [deg]F) or such other temperature as specified 
by an applicable subpart of the standards or approved by the 
Administrator for a particular application. The PM mass, which includes 
any material that condenses on the probe and is subsequently removed in 
an acetone rinse or on the filter at or above the filtration 
temperature, is determined gravimetrically after removal of uncombined 
water. MCEM is then determined by adding a methylene chloride rinse of 
the probe and filter holder, extracting the condensable hydrocarbons 
collected in the impinger water, adding an acetone rinse followed by a 
methylene chloride rinse of the sampling train components after the 
filter and before the silica gel impinger, and determining residue 
gravimetrically after evaporating the solvents.

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

    Note: Mention of trade names or specific products does not 
constitute endorsement by the EPA.

    6.1 Sample collection. The following items are required for sample 
collection:
    6.1.1 Sampling train. A schematic of the sampling train used in this 
method is shown in Figure 5-1, Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. 
Complete construction details are given in APTD-0581 (Reference 2 in 
section 17.0 of this method); commercial models of this train are also 
available. For changes from APTD-0581 and for allowable modifications of 
the train shown in Figure 5-1, Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, see 
the following subsections.

    Note: The operating and maintenance procedures for the sampling 
train are described in APTD-0576 (Reference 3 in section 17.0 of

[[Page 443]]

this method). Since correct usage is important in obtaining valid 
results, all users should read APTD-0576 and adopt the operating and 
maintenance procedures outlined in it, unless otherwise specified 
herein. The use of grease for sealing sampling train components is not 
recommended because many greases are soluble in methylene chloride. The 
sampling train consists of the following components:

    6.1.1.1 Probe nozzle. Glass or glass lined with sharp, tapered 
leading edge. The angle of taper shall be <=30 [deg], and the taper 
shall be on the outside to preserve a constant internal diameter. The 
probe nozzle shall be of the button-hook or elbow design, unless 
otherwise specified by the Administrator. Other materials of 
construction may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. 
A range of nozzle sizes suitable for isokinetic sampling should be 
available. Typical nozzle sizes range from 0.32 to 1.27 cm (\1/8\ to \1/
2\ in.) inside diameter (ID) in increments of 0.16 cm (\1/16\ in.). 
Larger nozzle sizes are also available if higher volume sampling trains 
are used. Each nozzle shall be calibrated according to the procedures 
outlined in section 10.0 of this method.
    6.1.1.2 Probe liner. Borosilicate or quartz glass tubing with a 
heating system capable of maintaining a probe gas temperature at the 
exit end during sampling of 120 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>14 [deg]C 
(248<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>25 [deg]F), or such other temperature as 
specified by an applicable subpart of the standards or approved by the 
Administrator for a particular application. Because the actual 
temperature at the outlet of the probe is not usually monitored during 
sampling, probes constructed according to APTD-0581 and using the 
calibration curves of APTD-0576 (or calibrated according to the 
procedure outlined in APTD-0576) will be considered acceptable. Either 
borosilicate or quartz glass probe liners may be used for stack 
temperatures up to about 480 [deg]C (900 [deg]F); quartz liners shall be 
used for temperatures between 480 and 900 [deg]C (900 and 1,650 [deg]F). 
Both types of liners may be used at higher temperatures than specified 
for short periods of time, subject to the approval of the Administrator. 
The softening temperature for borosilicate glass is 820 [deg]C (1,500 
[deg]F) and for quartz glass it is 1,500 [deg]C (2,700 [deg]F).
    6.1.1.3 Pitot tube. Type S, as described in section 6.1 of Method 2, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or other device approved by the 
Administrator. The pitot tube shall be attached to the probe (as shown 
in Figure 5-1 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to allow constant 
monitoring of the stack gas velocity. The impact (high pressure) opening 
plane of the pitot tube shall be even with or above the nozzle entry 
plane (see Method 2, Figure 2-6b, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A) during 
sampling. The Type S pitot tube assembly shall have a known coefficient, 
determined as outlined in section 10.0 of Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A.
    6.1.1.4 Differential pressure gauge. Inclined manometer or 
equivalent device (two), as described in section 6.2 of Method 2, 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A. One manometer shall be used for velocity head (Dp) 
readings, and the other, for orifice differential pressure readings.
    6.1.1.5 Filter holder. Borosilicate glass, with a glass frit filter 
support and a silicone rubber gasket. The holder design shall provide a 
positive seal against leakage from the outside or around the filter. The 
holder shall be attached immediately at the outlet of the probe (or 
cyclone, if used).
    6.1.1.6 Filter heating system. Any heating system capable of 
maintaining a temperature around the filter holder of 120 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>14 [deg]C (248 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>25 [deg]F) during 
sampling, or such other temperature as specified by an applicable 
subpart of the standards or approved by the Administrator for a 
particular application. Alternatively, the tester may opt to operate the 
equipment at a temperature lower than that specified. A temperature 
gauge capable of measuring temperature to within 3 [deg]C (5.4 [deg]F) 
shall be installed so that the temperature around the filter holder can 
be regulated and monitored during sampling. Heating systems other than 
the one shown in APTD-0581 may be used.
    6.1.1.7 Temperature sensor. A temperature sensor capable of 
measuring temperature to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3 [deg]C (5.4 
[deg]F) shall be installed so that the sensing tip of the temperature 
sensor is in direct contact with the sample gas, and the temperature 
around the filter holder can be regulated and monitored during sampling.
    6.1.1.8 Condenser. The following system shall be used to determine 
the stack gas moisture content: four glass impingers connected in series 
with leak-free ground glass fittings. The first, third, and fourth 
impingers shall be of the Greenburg-Smith design, modified by replacing 
the tip with a 1.3 cm (1/2 in.) ID glass tube extending to about 1.3 cm 
(1/2 in.) from the bottom of the flask. The second impinger shall be of 
the Greenburg-Smith design with the standard tip. The first and second 
impingers shall contain known quantities of water (section 8.3.1 of this 
method), the third shall be empty, and the fourth shall contain a known 
weight of silica gel or equivalent desiccant. A temperature sensor 
capable of measuring temperature to within 1 [deg]C (2 [deg]F) shall be 
placed at the outlet of the fourth impinger for monitoring.
    6.1.1.9 Metering system. Vacuum gauge, leak-free pump, temperature 
sensors capable of measuring temperature to within 3 [deg]C (5.4 
[deg]F), dry gas meter (DGM) capable of measuring volume to within 2 
percent, and related equipment, as shown in Figure 5-1 of Method 5, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A. Other metering systems capable of maintaining

[[Page 444]]

sampling rates within 10 percent of isokinetic and of determining sample 
volumes to within 2 percent may be used, subject to the approval of the 
Administrator. When the metering system is used in conjunction with a 
pitot tube, the system shall allow periodic checks of isokinetic rates.
    6.1.1.10 Sampling trains using metering systems designed for higher 
flow rates than that described in APTD-0581 or APTD-0576 may be used 
provided that the specifications of this method are met.
    6.1.2 Barometer. Mercury, aneroid, or other barometer capable of 
measuring atmospheric pressure to within 2.5 mm (0.1 in.) Hg.

    Note: The barometric reading may be obtained from a nearby National 
Weather Service station. In this case, the station value (which is the 
absolute barometric pressure) shall be requested and an adjustment for 
elevation differences between the weather station and sampling point 
shall be made at a rate of minus 2.5 mm (0.1 in) Hg per 30 m (100 ft) 
elevation increase or plus 2.5 mm (0.1 in) Hg per 30 m (100 ft) 
elevation decrease.

    6.1.3 Gas density determination equipment. Temperature sensor and 
pressure gauge, as described in sections 6.3 and 6.4 of Method 2, 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A, and gas analyzer, if necessary, as described in 
Method 3, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. The temperature sensor shall, 
preferably, be permanently attached to the pitot tube or sampling probe 
in a fixed configuration, such that the tip of the sensor extends beyond 
the leading edge of the probe sheath and does not touch any metal. 
Alternatively, the sensor may be attached just prior to use in the 
field. Note, however, that if the temperature sensor is attached in the 
field, the sensor must be placed in an interference-free arrangement 
with respect to the Type S pitot tube openings (see Method 2, Figure 2-
4, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A). As a second alternative, if a difference 
of not more than 1 percent in the average velocity measurement is to be 
introduced, the temperature sensor need not be attached to the probe or 
pitot tube. (This alternative is subject to the approval of the 
Administrator.)
    6.2 Sample recovery. The following items are required for sample 
recovery:
    6.2.1 Probe-liner and probe-nozzle brushes. Nylon or Teflon 
<SUP>[reg]</SUP> bristle brushes with stainless steel wire handles. The 
probe brush shall have extensions (at least as long as the probe) 
constructed of stainless steel, nylon, Teflon <SUP>[reg]</SUP>, or 
similarly inert material. The brushes shall be properly sized and shaped 
to brush out the probe liner and nozzle.
    6.2.2 Wash bottles. Glass wash bottles are recommended. Polyethylene 
or tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) wash bottles may be used, but they may 
introduce a positive bias due to contamination from the bottle. It is 
recommended that acetone not be stored in polyethylene or TFE bottles 
for longer than a month.
    6.2.3 Glass sample storage containers. Chemically resistant, 
borosilicate glass bottles, for acetone and methylene chloride washes 
and impinger water, 500 ml or 1,000 ml. Screw-cap liners shall either be 
rubber-backed Teflon <SUP>[reg]</SUP> or shall be constructed so as to 
be leak-free and resistant to chemical attack by acetone or methylene 
chloride. (Narrow-mouth glass bottles have been found to be less prone 
to leakage.) Alternatively, polyethylene bottles may be used.
    6.2.4 Petri dishes. For filter samples, glass, unless otherwise 
specified by the Administrator.
    6.2.5 Graduated cylinder and/or balance. To measure condensed water, 
acetone wash and methylene chloride wash used during field recovery of 
the samples, to within 1 ml or 1 g. Graduated cylinders shall have 
subdivisions no greater than 2 ml. Most laboratory balances are capable 
of weighing to the nearest 0.5 g or less. Any such balance is suitable 
for use here and in section 6.3.4 of this method.
    6.2.6 Plastic storage containers. Air-tight containers to store 
silica gel.
    6.2.7 Funnel and rubber policeman. To aid in transfer of silica gel 
to container; not necessary if silica gel is weighed in the field.
    6.2.8 Funnel. Glass or polyethylene, to aid in sample recovery.
    6.3 Sample analysis. The following equipment is required for sample 
analysis:
    6.3.1 Glass or Teflon <SUP>[reg]</SUP> weighing dishes.
    6.3.2 Desiccator. It is recommended that fresh desiccant be used to 
minimize the chance for positive bias due to absorption of organic 
material during drying.
    6.3.3 Analytical balance. To measure to within 0.l mg.
    6.3.4 Balance. To measure to within 0.5 g.
    6.3.5 Beakers. 250 ml.
    6.3.6 Hygrometer. To measure the relative humidity of the laboratory 
environment.
    6.3.7 Temperature sensor. To measure the temperature of the 
laboratory environment.
    6.3.8 Buchner fritted funnel. 30 ml size, fine (<50 micron)-porosity 
fritted glass.
    6.3.9 Pressure filtration apparatus.
    6.3.10 Aluminum dish. Flat bottom, smooth sides, and flanged top, 18 
mm deep and with an inside diameter of approximately 60 mm.

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards

    7.l Sample collection. The following reagents are required for 
sample collection:
    7.1.1 Filters. Glass fiber filters, without organic binder, 
exhibiting at least 99.95 percent efficiency (<0.05 percent penetration) 
on 0.3 micron dioctyl phthalate smoke particles. The filter efficiency 
test shall be conducted in accordance with ASTM Method D 2986-95A 
(incorporated by reference in Sec. 63.841

[[Page 445]]

of this part). Test data from the supplier's quality control program are 
sufficient for this purpose. In sources containing S0<INF>2</INF> or 
S0<INF>3</INF>, the filter material must be of a type that is unreactive 
to S0<INF>2</INF> or S0<INF>3</INF>. Reference 10 in section 17.0 of 
this method may be used to select the appropriate filter.
    7.1.2 Silica gel. Indicating type, 6 to l6 mesh. If previously used, 
dry at l75 [deg]C (350 [deg]F) for 2 hours. New silica gel may be used 
as received. Alternatively, other types of desiccants (equivalent or 
better) may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.
    7.1.3 Water. When analysis of the material caught in the impingers 
is required, deionized distilled water shall be used. Run blanks prior 
to field use to eliminate a high blank on test samples.
    7.1.4 Crushed ice.
    7.1.5 Stopcock grease. Acetone-insoluble, heat-stable silicone 
grease. This is not necessary if screw-on connectors with Teflon'' 
sleeves, or similar, are used. Alternatively, other types of stopcock 
grease may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. 
[Caution: Many stopcock greases are methylene chloride-soluble. Use 
sparingly and carefully remove prior to recovery to prevent 
contamination of the MCEM analysis.]
    7.2 Sample recovery. The following reagents are required for sample 
recovery:
    7.2.1 Acetone. Acetone with blank values < 1 ppm, by weight residue, 
is required. Acetone blanks may be run prior to field use, and only 
acetone with low blank values may be used. In no case shall a blank 
value of greater than 1E-06 of the weight of acetone used be subtracted 
from the sample weight.

    Note: This is more restrictive than Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A. At least one vendor (Supelco Incorporated located in 
Bellefonte, Pennsylvania) lists <1 mg/l as residue for its Environmental 
Analysis Solvents.

    7.2.2 Methylene chloride. Methylene chloride with a blank value <1.5 
ppm, by weight, residue. Methylene chloride blanks may be run prior to 
field use, and only methylene chloride with low blank values may be 
used. In no case shall a blank value of greater than 1.6E-06 of the 
weight of methylene chloride used be subtracted from the sample weight.

    Note: A least one vendor quotes <1 mg/l for Environmental Analysis 
Solvents-grade methylene chloride.

    7.3 Sample analysis. The following reagents are required for sample 
analysis:
    7.3.l Acetone. Same as in section 7.2.1 of this method.
    7.3.2 Desiccant. Anhydrous calcium sulfate, indicating type. 
Alternatively, other types of desiccants may be used, subject to the 
approval of the Administrator.
    7.3.3 Methylene chloride. Same as in section 7.2.2 of this method.

       8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport

    Note: The complexity of this method is such that, in order to obtain 
reliable results, testers should be trained and experienced with the 
test procedures.

    8.11 Pretest preparation. It is suggested that sampling equipment be 
maintained according to the procedures described in APTD-0576.
    8.1.1 Weigh several 200 g to 300 g portions of silica gel in 
airtight containers to the nearest 0.5 g. Record on each container the 
total weight of the silica gel plus container. As an alternative, the 
silica gel need not be preweighed but may be weighed directly in its 
impinger or sampling holder just prior to train assembly.
    8.1.2 A batch of glass fiber filters, no more than 50 at a time, 
should placed in a soxhlet extraction apparatus and extracted using 
methylene chloride for at least 16 hours. After extraction, check 
filters visually against light for irregularities, flaws, or pinhole 
leaks. Label the shipping containers (glass or plastic petri dishes), 
and keep the filters in these containers at all times except during 
sampling and weighing.
    8.1.3 Desiccate the filters at 20 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5.6 [deg]C 
(68 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 [deg]F) and ambient pressure for at least 
24 hours and weigh at intervals of at least 6 hours to a constant 
weight, i.e., <0.5 mg change from previous weighing; record results to 
the nearest 0.1 mg. During each weighing the filter must not be exposed 
to the laboratory atmosphere for longer than 2 minutes and a relative 
humidity above 50 percent. Alternatively (unless otherwise specified by 
the Administrator), the filters may be oven-dried at 104 [deg]C (220 
[deg]F) for 2 to 3 hours, desiccated for 2 hours, and weighed. 
Procedures other than those described, which account for relative 
humidity effects, may be used, subject to the approval of the 
Administrator.
    8.2 Preliminary determinations.
    8.2.1 Select the sampling site and the minimum number of sampling 
points according to Method 1, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A or as specified 
by the Administrator. Determine the stack pressure, temperature, and the 
range of velocity heads using Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A; it 
is recommended that a leak check of the pitot lines (see section 8.1 of 
Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A) be performed. Determine the 
moisture content using Approximation Method 4 (section 1.2 of Method 4, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A) or its alternatives to make isokinetic 
sampling rate settings. Determine the stack gas dry molecular weight, as 
described in section 8.6 of Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A; if 
integrated Method 3 sampling is used for molecular weight determination, 
the integrated bag sample shall be taken simultaneously with, and for

[[Page 446]]

the same total length of time as, the particulate sample run.
    8.2.2 Select a nozzle size based on the range of velocity heads such 
that it is not necessary to change the nozzle size in order to maintain 
isokinetic sampling rates. During the run, do not change the nozzle 
size. Ensure that the proper differential pressure gauge is chosen for 
the range of velocity heads encountered (see section 8.2 of Method 2, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A).
    8.2.3 Select a suitable probe liner and probe length such that all 
traverse points can be sampled. For large stacks, consider sampling from 
opposite sides of the stack to reduce the required probe length.
    8.2.4 Select a total sampling time greater than or equal to the 
minimum total sampling time specified in the test procedures for the 
specific industry such that: (1) The sampling time per point is not less 
than 2 minutes (or some greater time interval as specified by the 
Administrator); and (2) the sample volume taken (corrected to standard 
conditions) will exceed the required minimum total gas sample volume. 
The latter is based on an approximate average sampling rate.
    8.2.5 The sampling time at each point shall be the same. It is 
recommended that the number of minutes sampled at each point be an 
integer or an integer plus one-half minute, in order to eliminate 
timekeeping errors.
    8.2.6 In some circumstances (e.g., batch cycles), it may be 
necessary to sample for shorter times at the traverse points and to 
obtain smaller gas sample volumes. In these cases, the Administrator's 
approval must first be obtained.
    8.3 Preparation of sampling train.
    8.3.1 During preparation and assembly of the sampling train, keep 
all openings where contamination can occur covered until just prior to 
assembly or until sampling is about to begin. Place l00 ml of water in 
each of the first two impingers, leave the third impinger empty, and 
transfer approximately 200 to 300 g of preweighed silica gel from its 
container to the fourth impinger. More silica gel may be used, but care 
should be taken to ensure that it is not entrained and carried out from 
the impinger during sampling. Place the container in a clean place for 
later use in the sample recovery. Alternatively, the weight of the 
silica gel plus impinger may be determined to the nearest 0.5 g and 
recorded.
    8.3.2 Using a tweezer or clean disposable surgical gloves, place a 
labeled (identified) and weighed filter in the filter holder. Be sure 
that the filter is properly centered and the gasket properly placed so 
as to prevent the sample gas stream from circumventing the filter. Check 
the filter for tears after assembly is completed.
    8.3.3 When glass liners are used, install the selected nozzle using 
a Viton A 0-ring when stack temperatures are less than 260 [deg]C (500 
[deg]F) and an asbestos string gasket when temperatures are higher. See 
APTD-0576 for details. Mark the probe with heat-resistant tape or by 
some other method to denote the proper distance into the stack or duct 
for each sampling point.
    8.3.4 Set up the train as in Figure 5-1 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A, using (if necessary) a very light coat of silicone grease on 
all ground glass joints, greasing only the outer portion (see APTD-0576) 
to avoid possibility of contamination by the silicone grease. Subject to 
the approval of the Administrator, a glass cyclone may be used between 
the probe and filter holder when the total particulate catch is expected 
to exceed 100 mg or when water droplets are present in the stack gas.
    8.3.5 Place crushed ice around the impingers.
    8.4 Leak-check procedures.
    8.4.1 Leak check of metering system shown in Figure 5-1 of Method 5, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A. That portion of the sampling train from the 
pump to the orifice meter should be leak-checked prior to initial use 
and after each shipment. Leakage after the pump will result in less 
volume being recorded than is actually sampled. The following procedure 
is suggested (see Figure 5-2 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A): 
Close the main valve on the meter box. Insert a one-hole rubber stopper 
with rubber tubing attached into the orifice exhaust pipe. Disconnect 
and vent the low side of the orifice manometer. Close off the low side 
orifice tap. Pressurize the system to 13 to 18 cm (5 to 7 in.) water 
column by blowing into the rubber tubing. Pinch off the tubing, and 
observe the manometer for 1 minute. A loss of pressure on the manometer 
indicates a leak in the meter box; leaks, if present, must be corrected.
    8.4.2 Pretest leak check. A pretest leak-check is recommended but 
not required. If the pretest leak-check is conducted, the following 
procedure should be used.
    8.4.2.1 After the sampling train has been assembled, turn on and set 
the filter and probe heating systems to the desired operating 
temperatures. Allow time for the temperatures to stabilize. If a Viton A 
0-ring or other leak-free connection is used in assembling the probe 
nozzle to the probe liner, leak-check the train at the sampling site by 
plugging the nozzle and pulling a 380 mm (15 in.) Hg vacuum.

    Note: A lower vacuum may be used, provided that it is not exceeded 
during the test.

    8.4.2.2 If an asbestos string is used, do not connect the probe to 
the train during the leak check. Instead, leak-check the train by first 
plugging the inlet to the filter holder (cyclone, if applicable) and 
pulling a 380 mm (15 in.) Hg vacuum. (See NOTE in section

[[Page 447]]

8.4.2.1 of this method). Then connect the probe to the train and perform 
the leak check at approximately 25 mm (1 in.) Hg vacuum; alternatively, 
the probe may be leak-checked with the rest of the sampling train, in 
one step, at 380 mm (15 in.) Hg vacuum. Leakage rates in excess of 4 
percent of the average sampling rate or 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm), 
whichever is less, are unacceptable.
    8.4.2.3 The following leak check instructions for the sampling train 
described in APTD-0576 and APTD-058l may be helpful. Start the pump with 
the bypass valve fully open and the coarse adjust valve completely 
closed. Partially open the coarse adjust valve and slowly close the 
bypass valve until the desired vacuum is reached. Do not reverse the 
direction of the bypass valve, as this will cause water to back up into 
the filter holder. If the desired vacuum is exceeded, either leak-check 
at this higher vacuum or end the leak check as shown below and start 
over.
    8.4.2.4 When the leak check is completed, first slowly remove the 
plug from the inlet to the probe, filter holder, or cyclone (if 
applicable) and immediately turn off the vacuum pump. This prevents the 
water in the impingers from being forced backward into the filter holder 
and the silica gel from being entrained backward into the third 
impinger.
    8.4.3 Leak checks during sample run. If, during the sampling run, a 
component (e.g., filter assembly or impinger) change becomes necessary, 
a leak check shall be conducted immediately before the change is made. 
The leak check shall be done according to the procedure outlined in 
section 8.4.2 of this method, except that it shall be done at a vacuum 
equal to or greater than the maximum value recorded up to that point in 
the test. If the leakage rate is found to be no greater than 0.00057 
m\3\/min (0.02 cfm) or 4 percent of the average sampling rate (whichever 
is less), the results are acceptable, and no correction will need to be 
applied to the total volume of dry gas metered; if, however, a higher 
leakage rate is obtained, either record the leakage rate and plan to 
correct the sample volume as shown in section 12.3 of this method or 
void the sample run.

    Note: Immediately after component changes, leak checks are optional; 
if such leak checks are done, the procedure outlined in section 8.4.2 of 
this method should be used.

    8.4.4 Post-test leak check. A leak check is mandatory at the 
conclusion of each sampling run. The leak check shall be performed in 
accordance with the procedures outlined in section 8.4.2 of this method, 
except that it shall be conducted at a vacuum equal to or greater than 
the maximum value reached during the sampling run. If the leakage rate 
is found to be no greater than 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm) or 4 percent 
of the average sampling rate (whichever is less), the results are 
acceptable, and no correction need be applied to the total volume of dry 
gas metered. If, however, a higher leakage rate is obtained, either 
record the leakage rate and correct the sample volume, as shown in 
section 12.4 of this method, or void the sampling run.
    8.5 Sampling train operation. During the sampling run, maintain an 
isokinetic sampling rate (within l0 percent of true isokinetic unless 
otherwise specified by the Administrator) and a temperature around the 
filter of 120 14 [deg]C (248 25 [deg]F), or such other temperature as 
specified by an applicable subpart of the standards or approved by the 
Administrator.
    8.5.1 For each run, record the data required on a data sheet such as 
the one shown in Figure 5-2 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Be 
sure to record the initial reading. Record the DGM readings at the 
beginning and end of each sampling time increment, when changes in flow 
rates are made, before and after each leak-check, and when sampling is 
halted. Take other readings indicated by Figure 5-2 of Method 5, 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A at least once at each sample point during each time 
increment and additional readings when significant changes (20 percent 
variation in velocity head readings) necessitate additional adjustments 
in flow rate. Level and zero the manometer. Because the manometer level 
and zero may drift due to vibrations and temperature changes, make 
periodic checks during the traverse.
    8.5.2 Clean the portholes prior to the test run to minimize the 
chance of sampling deposited material. To begin sampling, remove the 
nozzle cap and verify that the filter and probe heating systems are up 
to temperature and that the pitot tube and probe are properly 
positioned. Position the nozzle at the first traverse point with the tip 
pointing directly into the gas stream. Immediately start the pump and 
adjust the flow to isokinetic conditions. Nomographs are available, 
which aid in the rapid adjustment of the isokinetic sampling rate 
without excessive computations. These nomographs are designed for use 
when the Type S pitot tube coefficient (C<INF>p</INF>) is 0.85 <greek-i> 
0.02 and the stack gas equivalent density (dry molecular weight) is 29 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>4. APTD-0576 details the procedure for using the 
nomographs. If C<INF>p</INF> and M<INF>d</INF> are outside the above-
stated ranges, do not use the nomographs unless appropriate steps (see 
Reference 7 in section 17.0 of this method) are taken to compensate for 
the deviations.
    8.5.3 When the stack is under significant negative pressure (height 
of impinger stem), close the coarse adjust valve before inserting the 
probe into the stack to prevent water from backing into the filter 
holder. If necessary, the pump may be turned on with the coarse adjust 
valve closed.

[[Page 448]]

    8.5.4 When the probe is in position, block off the openings around 
the probe and porthole to prevent unrepresentative dilution of the gas 
stream.
    8.5.5 Traverse the stack cross-section, as required by Method 1, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A or as specified by the Administrator, being 
careful not to bump the probe nozzle into the stack walls when sampling 
near the walls or when removing or inserting the probe through the 
portholes; this minimizes the chance of extracting deposited material.
    8.5.6 During the test run, make periodic adjustments to keep the 
temperature around the filter holder at the proper level; add more ice 
and, if necessary, salt to maintain a temperature of less than 20 [deg]C 
(68 [deg]F) at the condenser/silica gel outlet. Also, periodically check 
the level and zero of the manometer.
    8.5.7 If the pressure drop across the filter becomes too high, 
making isokinetic sampling difficult to maintain, the filter may be 
replaced in the midst of the sample run. It is recommended that another 
complete filter assembly be used rather than attempting to change the 
filter itself. Before a new filter assembly is installed, conduct a leak 
check (see section 8.4.3 of this method). The total PM weight shall 
include the summation of the filter assembly catches.
    8.5.8 A single train shall be used for the entire sample run, except 
in cases where simultaneous sampling is required in two or more separate 
ducts or at two or more different locations within the same duct, or in 
cases where equipment failure necessitates a change of trains. In all 
other situations, the use of two or more trains will be subject to the 
approval of the Administrator.

    Note: When two or more trains are used, separate analyses of the 
front-half and (if applicable) impinger catches from each train shall be 
performed, unless identical nozzle sizes were used in all trains, in 
which case the front-half catches from the individual trains may be 
combined (as may the impinger catches) and one analysis of the front-
half catch and one analysis of the impinger catch may be performed.

    8.5.9 At the end of the sample run, turn off the coarse adjust 
valve, remove the probe and nozzle from the stack, turn off the pump, 
record the final DGM reading, and then conduct a post-test leak check, 
as outlined in section 8.4.4 of this method. Also leak-check the pitot 
lines as described in section 8.1 of Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix 
A. The lines must pass this leak check in order to validate the velocity 
head data.
    8.6 Calculation of percent isokinetic. Calculate percent isokinetic 
(see Calculations, section 12.12 of this method) to determine whether a 
run was valid or another test run should be made. If there was 
difficulty in maintaining isokinetic rates because of source conditions, 
consult the Administrator for possible variance on the isokinetic rates.
    8.7 Sample recovery.
    8.7.1 Proper cleanup procedure begins as soon as the probe is 
removed from the stack at the end of the sampling period. Allow the 
probe to cool.
    8.7.2 When the probe can be safely handled, wipe off all external PM 
near the tip of the probe nozzle and place a cap over it to prevent 
losing or gaining PM. Do not cap off the probe tip tightly while the 
sampling train is cooling down. This would create a vacuum in the filter 
holder, thus drawing water from the impingers into the filter holder.
    8.7.3 Before moving the sample train to the cleanup site, remove the 
probe from the sample train, wipe off the silicone grease, and cap the 
open outlet of the probe. Be careful not to lose any condensate that 
might be present. Wipe off the silicone grease from the filter inlet 
where the probe was fastened and cap it. Remove the umbilical cord from 
the last impinger and cap the impinger. If a flexible line is used 
between the first impinger or condenser and the filter holder, 
disconnect the line at the filter holder and let any condensed water or 
liquid drain into the impingers or condenser. After wiping off the 
silicone grease, cap off the filter holder outlet and impinger inlet. 
Ground-glass stoppers, plastic caps, or serum caps may be used to close 
these openings.
    8.7.4 Transfer the probe and filter-impinger assembly to the cleanup 
area. This area should be clean and protected from the wind so that the 
chances of contaminating or losing the sample will be minimized.
    8.7.5 Save a portion of the acetone and methylene chloride used for 
cleanup as blanks. Take 200 ml of each solvent directly from the wash 
bottle being used and place it in glass sample containers labeled 
``acetone blank'' and ``methylene chloride blank,'' respectively.
    8.7.6 Inspect the train prior to and during disassembly and note any 
abnormal conditions. Treat the samples as follows:
    8.7.6.1 Container No. 1. Carefully remove the filter from the filter 
holder, and place it in its identified petri dish container. Use a pair 
of tweezers and/or clean disposable surgical gloves to handle the 
filter. If it is necessary to fold the filter, do so such that the PM 
cake is inside the fold. Using a dry nylon bristle brush and/or a sharp-
edged blade, carefully transfer to the petri dish any PM and/or filter 
fibers that adhere to the filter holder gasket. Seal the container.
    8.7.6.2 Container No. 2. Taking care to see that dust on the outside 
of the probe or other exterior surfaces does not get into the sample, 
quantitatively recover PM or any condensate from the probe nozzle, probe 
fitting, probe liner, and front half of the filter holder by washing 
these components with acetone

[[Page 449]]

and placing the wash in a glass container. Perform the acetone rinse as 
follows:
    8.7.6.2.1 Carefully remove the probe nozzle and clean the inside 
surface by rinsing with acetone from a wash bottle and brushing with a 
nylon bristle brush. Brush until the acetone rinse shows no visible 
particles, after which make a final rinse of the inside surface with 
acetone.
    8.7.6.2.2 Brush and rinse the inside parts of the Swagelok fitting 
with acetone in a similar way until no visible particles remain.
    8.7.6.2.3 Rinse the probe liner with acetone by tilting and rotating 
the probe while squirting acetone into its upper end so that all inside 
surfaces are wetted with acetone. Let the acetone drain from the lower 
end into the sample container. A funnel (glass or polyethylene) may be 
used to aid in transferring liquid washes to the container. Follow the 
acetone rinse with a probe brush. Hold the probe in an inclined 
position, squirt acetone into the upper end as the probe brush is being 
pushed with a twisting action through the probe, hold a sample container 
under the lower end of the probe, and catch any acetone and PM that is 
brushed from the probe. Run the brush through the probe three times or 
more until no visible PM is carried out with the acetone or until none 
remains in the probe liner on visual inspection. With stainless steel or 
other metal probes, run the brush through in the above-described manner 
at least six times, since metal probes have small crevices in which PM 
can be entrapped. Rinse the brush with acetone and quantitatively 
collect these washings in the sample container. After the brushing, make 
a final acetone rinse of the probe as described above.
    8.7.6.2.4 It is recommended that two people clean the probe to 
minimize sample losses. Between sampling runs, keep brushes clean and 
protected from contamination.
    8.7.6.2.5 After ensuring that all joints have been wiped clean of 
silicone grease, clean the inside of the front half of the filter holder 
by rubbing the surfaces with a nylon bristle brush and rinsing with 
acetone. Rinse each surface three times or more if needed to remove 
visible particulate. Make a final rinse of the brush and filter holder. 
Carefully rinse out the glass cyclone also (if applicable).
    8.7.6.2.6 After rinsing the nozzle, probe, and front half of the 
filter holder with acetone, repeat the entire procedure with methylene 
chloride and save in a separate No. 2M container.
    8.7.6.2.7 After acetone and methylene chloride washings and PM have 
been collected in the proper sample containers, tighten the lid on the 
sample containers so that acetone and methylene chloride will not leak 
out when it is shipped to the laboratory. Mark the height of the fluid 
level to determine whether leakage occurs during transport. Label each 
container to identify clearly its contents.
    8.7.6.3 Container No. 3. Note the color of the indicating silica gel 
to determine whether it has been completely spent, and make a notation 
of its condition. Transfer the silica gel from the fourth impinger to 
its original container and seal the container. A funnel may make it 
easier to pour the silica gel without spilling. A rubber policeman may 
be used as an aid in removing the silica gel from the impinger. It is 
not necessary to remove the small amount of dust particles that may 
adhere to the impinger wall and are difficult to remove. Since the gain 
in weight is to be used for moisture calculations, do not use any water 
or other liquids to transfer the silica gel. If a balance is available 
in the field, follow the procedure for Container No. 3 in section 11.2.3 
of this method.
    8.7.6.4 Impinger water. Treat the impingers as follows:
    8.7.6.4.1 Make a notation of any color or film in the liquid catch. 
Measure the liquid that is in the first three impingers to within 1 ml 
by using a graduated cylinder or by weighing it to within 0.5 g by using 
a balance (if one is available). Record the volume or weight of liquid 
present. This information is required to calculate the moisture content 
of the effluent gas.
    8.7.6.4.2 Following the determination of the volume of liquid 
present, rinse the back half of the train with water, add it to the 
impinger catch, and store it in a container labeled 3W (water).
    8.7.6.4.3 Following the water rinse, rinse the back half of the 
train with acetone to remove the excess water to enhance subsequent 
organic recovery with methylene chloride and quantitatively recover to a 
container labeled 3S (solvent) followed by at least three sequential 
rinsings with aliquots of methylene chloride. Quantitatively recover to 
the same container labeled 3S. Record separately the amount of both 
acetone and methylene chloride used to the nearest 1 ml or 0.5g.

    Note: Because the subsequent analytical finish is gravimetric, it is 
okay to recover both solvents to the same container. This would not be 
recommended if other analytical finishes were required.

    8.8 Sample transport. Whenever possible, containers should be 
shipped in such a way that they remain upright at all times.

    9.2 Volume metering system checks. The following quality control 
procedures are suggested to check the volume metering system calibration 
values at the field test site prior to sample collection. These 
procedures are optional.
    9.2.1 Meter orifice check. Using the calibration data obtained 
during the calibration procedure described in section 10.3 of this 
method, determine the [Delta]H<INF>a</INF> for the metering system 
orifice. The [Delta]H<INF>a</INF> is the orifice pressure differential 
in units of in. H<INF>2</INF>0 that correlates to 0.75 cfm of air at 528 
[deg]R and 29.92 in. Hg. The [Delta]H<INF>a</INF> is calculated as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07OC97.008

Where

0.0319 = (0.0567 in. Hg/ [deg]R)(0.75 cfm)\2\;
[Delta]H = Average pressure differential across the orifice meter, in. 
H<INF>2</INF>0;
T<INF>m</INF> = Absolute average DGM temperature, [deg]R;
[Theta] = Total sampling time, min;
P<INF>bar</INF> = Barometric pressure, in. Hg;
Y = DGM calibration factor, dimensionless;
V<INF>m</INF> = Volume of gas sample as measured by DGM, dcf.

    9.2.1.1 Before beginning the field test (a set of three runs usually 
constitutes a field test), operate the metering system (i.e., pump, 
volume meter, and orifice) at the [Delta]H<INF>a</INF> pressure 
differential for 10 minutes. Record the volume collected, the DGM 
temperature, and the barometric pressure. Calculate a DGM calibration 
check value, Y<INF>c</INF>, as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07OC97.009

Where

Y<INF>c</INF> = DGM calibration check value, dimensionless;
10 = Run time, min.

    9.2.1.2 Compare the Y<INF>c</INF> value with the dry gas meter 
calibration factor Y to determine that: 0.97 Y < Y<INF>c</INF> < 1.03Y. 
If the Y<INF>c</INF> value is not within this range, the volume metering 
system should be investigated before beginning the test.
    9.2.2 Calibrated critical orifice. A calibrated critical orifice, 
calibrated against a wet test meter or spirometer and designed to be 
inserted at the inlet of the sampling meter box, may be used as a 
quality control check by following the procedure of section 16.2 of this 
method.

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    Note: Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.

    10.1 Probe nozzle. Probe nozzles shall be calibrated before their 
initial use in the field. Using a micrometer, measure the ID of the 
nozzle to the nearest 0.025 mm (0.001 in.). Make three separate 
measurements using different diameters each time, and obtain the average 
of the measurements. The difference between the high and low numbers 
shall not exceed 0.1 mm (0.004 in.). When nozzles become nicked, dented, 
or corroded, they shall be reshaped, sharpened, and recalibrated before 
use. Each nozzle shall be permanently and uniquely identified.
    10.2 Pitot tube assembly. The Type S pitot tube assembly shall be 
calibrated according to the procedure outlined in section 10.1 of Method 
2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    10.3 Metering system.
    10.3.1 Calibration prior to use. Before its initial use in the 
field, the metering system shall be calibrated as follows: Connect the 
metering system inlet to the outlet of a wet test meter that is accurate 
to within 1 percent. Refer to Figure 5-5 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A. The wet test meter should have a capacity of 30 liters/
revolution (1 ft\3\/rev). A spirometer of 400 liters (14 ft\3\) or more 
capacity, or equivalent, may be used for this calibration, although a 
wet test meter is usually more practical. The wet test meter should be 
periodically calibrated with a spirometer or a liquid displacement meter 
to ensure the accuracy of the wet test meter. Spirometers or wet test 
meters of other sizes may be used, provided that the specified 
accuracies of the procedure are maintained. Run the metering system pump 
for about 15 minutes with the orifice manometer indicating a median 
reading, as expected in field use, to allow the pump to warm up and to 
permit the interior surface of the wet test meter to be thoroughly 
wetted. Then, at each of a minimum of three orifice manometer settings, 
pass an exact quantity of gas through the wet test meter and note the 
gas volume indicated by the DGM. Also note the

[[Page 451]]

barometric pressure and the temperatures of the wet test meter, the 
inlet of the DGM, and the outlet of the DGM. Select the highest and 
lowest orifice settings to bracket the expected field operating range of 
the orifice. Use a minimum volume of 0.15 m\3\ (5 cf) at all orifice 
settings. Record all the data on a form similar to Figure 5-6 of Method 
5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, and calculate Y (the DGM calibration 
factor) and [Delta]H<INF>a</INF> (the orifice calibration factor) at 
each orifice setting, as shown on Figure 5-6 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 
60, appendix A. Allowable tolerances for individual Y and 
[Delta]H<INF>a</INF> values are given in Figure 5-6 of Method 5, 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A. Use the average of the Y values in the calculations 
in section 12 of this method.
    10.3.1.1 Before calibrating the metering system, it is suggested 
that a leak check be conducted. For metering systems having diaphragm 
pumps, the normal leak check procedure will not detect leakages within 
the pump. For these cases the following leak check procedure is 
suggested: make a 10-minute calibration run at 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 
cfm); at the end of the run, take the difference of the measured wet 
test meter and DGM volumes; divide the difference by 10 to get the leak 
rate. The leak rate should not exceed 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm).
    10.3.2 Calibration after use. After each field use, the calibration 
of the metering system shall be checked by performing three calibration 
runs at a single, intermediate orifice setting (based on the previous 
field test) with the vacuum set at the maximum value reached during the 
test series. To adjust the vacuum, insert a valve between the wet test 
meter and the inlet of the metering system. Calculate the average value 
of the DGM calibration factor. If the value has changed by more than 5 
percent, recalibrate the meter over the full range of orifice settings, 
as previously detailed.

    Note: Alternative procedures, e.g., rechecking the orifice meter 
coefficient, may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.

    10.3.3 Acceptable variation in calibration. If the DGM coefficient 
values obtained before and after a test series differ by more than 5 
percent, either the test series shall be voided or calculations for the 
test series shall be performed using whichever meter coefficient value 
(i.e., before or after) gives the lower value of total sample volume.
    10.4 Probe heater calibration. Use a heat source to generate air 
heated to selected temperatures that approximate those expected to occur 
in the sources to be sampled. Pass this air through the probe at a 
typical sample flow rate while measuring the probe inlet and outlet 
temperatures at various probe heater settings. For each air temperature 
generated, construct a graph of probe heating system setting versus 
probe outlet temperature. The procedure outlined in APTD-0576 can also 
be used. Probes constructed according to APTD-0581 need not be 
calibrated if the calibration curves in APTD-0576 are used. Also, probes 
with outlet temperature monitoring capabilities do not require 
calibration.

    Note: The probe heating system shall be calibrated before its 
initial use in the field.

    10.5 Temperature sensors. Use the procedure in section 10.3 of 
Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A to calibrate in-stack temperature 
sensors. Dial thermometers, such as are used for the DGM and condenser 
outlet, shall be calibrated against mercury-in-glass thermometers.
    10.6 Barometer. Calibrate against a mercury barometer.

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    11.1 Record the data required on a sheet such as the one shown in 
Figure 315-1 of this method.
    11.2 Handle each sample container as follows:
    11.2.1 Container No. 1.
    11.2.1.1 PM analysis. Leave the contents in the shipping container 
or transfer the filter and any loose PM from the sample container to a 
tared glass weighing dish. Desiccate for 24 hours in a desiccator 
containing anhydrous calcium sulfate. Weigh to a constant weight and 
report the results to the nearest 0.1 mg. For purposes of this section, 
the term ``constant weight'' means a difference of no more than 0.5 mg 
or 1 percent of total weight less tare weight, whichever is greater, 
between two consecutive weighings, with no less than 6 hours of 
desiccation time between weighings (overnight desiccation is a common 
practice). If a third weighing is required and it agrees within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 mg, then the results of the second weighing should 
be used. For quality assurance purposes, record and report each 
individual weighing; if more than three weighings are required, note 
this in the results for the subsequent MCEM results.
    11.2.1.2 MCEM analysis. Transfer the filter and contents 
quantitatively into a beaker. Add 100 ml of methylene chloride and cover 
with aluminum foil. Sonicate for 3 minutes then allow to stand for 20 
minutes. Set up the filtration apparatus. Decant the solution into a 
clean Buchner fritted funnel. Immediately pressure filter the solution 
through the tube into another clean, dry beaker. Continue decanting and 
pressure filtration until all the solvent is transferred. Rinse the 
beaker and filter with 10 to 20 ml methylene chloride, decant into the 
Buchner fritted funnel and pressure filter. Place the beaker on a low-
temperature hot plate (maximum 40 [deg]C) and slowly evaporate almost to

[[Page 452]]

dryness. Transfer the remaining last few milliliters of solution 
quantitatively from the beaker (using at least three aliquots of 
methylene chloride rinse) to a tared clean dry aluminum dish and 
evaporate to complete dryness. Remove from heat once solvent is 
evaporated. Reweigh the dish after a 30-minute equilibrium in the 
balance room and determine the weight to the nearest 0.1 mg. Conduct a 
methylene chloride blank run in an identical fashion.
    11.2.2 Container No. 2.
    11.2.2.1 PM analysis. Note the level of liquid in the container, and 
confirm on the analysis sheet whether leakage occurred during transport. 
If a noticeable amount of leakage has occurred, either void the sample 
or use methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to correct 
the final results. Measure the liquid in this container either 
volumetrically to <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 ml or gravimetrically to 1 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 g. Transfer the contents to a tared 250 ml 
beaker and evaporate to dryness at ambient temperature and pressure. 
Desiccate for 24 hours, and weigh to a constant weight. Report the 
results to the nearest 0.1 mg.
    11.2.2.2 MCEM analysis. Add 25 ml methylene chloride to the beaker 
and cover with aluminum foil. Sonicate for 3 minutes then allow to stand 
for 20 minutes; combine with contents of Container No. 2M and pressure 
filter and evaporate as described for Container 1 in section 11.2.1.2 of 
this method.

                         Notes for MCEM Analysis

    1. Light finger pressure only is necessary on 24/40 adaptor. A 
Chemplast adapter <greek-i>15055-240 has been found satisfactory.
    2. Avoid aluminum dishes made with fluted sides, as these may 
promote solvent ``creep,'' resulting in possible sample loss.
    3. If multiple samples are being run, rinse the Buchner fritted 
funnel twice between samples with 5 ml solvent using pressure 
filtration. After the second rinse, continue the flow of air until the 
glass frit is completely dry. Clean the Buchner fritted funnels 
thoroughly after filtering five or six samples.

    11.2.3 Container No. 3. Weigh the spent silica gel (or silica gel 
plus impinger) to the nearest 0.5 g using a balance. This step may be 
conducted in the field.
    11.2.4 Container 3W (impinger water).
    11.2.4.1 MCEM analysis. Transfer the solution into a 1,000 ml 
separatory funnel quantitatively with methylene chloride washes. Add 
enough solvent to total approximately 50 ml, if necessary. Shake the 
funnel for 1 minute, allow the phases to separate, and drain the solvent 
layer into a 250 ml beaker. Repeat the extraction twice. Evaporate with 
low heat (less than 40 [deg]C) until near dryness. Transfer the 
remaining few milliliters of solvent quantitatively with small solvent 
washes into a clean, dry, tared aluminum dish and evaporate to dryness. 
Remove from heat once solvent is evaporated. Reweigh the dish after a 
30-minute equilibration in the balance room and determine the weight to 
the nearest 0.1 mg.

    11.2.5 Container 3S (solvent).
    11.2.5.1 MCEM analysis. Transfer the mixed solvent to 250 ml 
beaker(s). Evaporate and weigh following the procedures detailed for 
container 3W in section 11.2.4 of this method.
    11.2.6 Blank containers. Measure the distilled water, acetone, or 
methylene chloride in each container either volumetrically or 
gravimetrically. Transfer the ``solvent'' to a tared 250 ml beaker, and 
evaporate to dryness at ambient temperature and pressure. (Conduct a 
solvent blank on the distilled deionized water blank in an identical 
fashion to that described in section 11.2.4.1 of this method.) Desiccate 
for 24 hours, and weigh to a constant weight. Report the results to the 
nearest 0.l mg.

    Note: The contents of Containers No. 2, 3W, and 3M as well as the 
blank containers may be evaporated at temperatures higher than ambient. 
If evaporation is done at an elevated temperature, the temperature must 
be below the boiling point of the solvent; also, to prevent ``bumping,'' 
the evaporation process must be closely supervised, and the contents of 
the beaker must be swirled occasionally to maintain an even temperature. 
Use extreme care, as acetone and methylene chloride are highly flammable 
and have a low flash point.

                   12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

    12.1 Carry out calculations, retaining at least one extra decimal

leak check or leak checks conducted prior to component changes) exceeds

    Note: In saturated or water droplet-laden gas streams, two 
calculations of the moisture content of the stack gas shall be made, one 
from the impinger analysis (Equation 315-3), and a second from the 
assumption of saturated conditions. The lower of the two values of 
B<INF>ws</INF> shall be considered correct. The procedure for 
determining the moisture content based upon assumption of saturated 
conditions is given in section 4.0 of Method 4, 40 CFR part 60, appendix 
A. For the purposes of this method, the average stack gas temperature 
from Figure 5-2 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A may be used to 
make this determination, provided that the accuracy of the in-stack 
temperature sensor is <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 [deg]C (2 [deg]F).

    12.12.3 Acceptable results. If 90 percent <= I <= 110 percent, the 
results are acceptable. If the PM or MCEM results are low in comparison 
to the standard, and ``I'' is over 110 percent or less than 90 percent, 
the Administrator may opt to accept the results. Reference 4 in the 
Bibliography may be used to make acceptability judgments. If ``I'' is 
judged to be unacceptable, reject the results, and repeat the test.

                       16.0 Alternative Procedures

    16.1 Dry gas meter as a calibration standard. A DGM may be used as a 
calibration standard for volume measurements in place of the wet test 
meter specified in section 16.1 of this method, provided that it is 
calibrated initially and recalibrated periodically as follows:
    16.1.1 Standard dry gas meter calibration.
    16.1.1.1. The DGM to be calibrated and used as a secondary reference 
meter should be of high quality and have an appropriately sized 
capacity, e.g., 3 liters/rev (0.1 ft \3\/rev). A spirometer (400 liters 
or more capacity), or equivalent, may be used for this calibration, 
although a wet test meter is usually more practical. The wet test meter 
should have a capacity of 30 liters/rev (1 ft \3\/rev) and be capable of 
measuring volume to within 1.0 percent; wet test meters should be 
checked against a spirometer or a liquid displacement meter to ensure 
the accuracy of the wet test meter. Spirometers or wet test meters of 
other sizes may be used, provided that the specified accuracies of the 
procedure are maintained.
    16.1.1.2 Set up the components as shown in Figure 5-7 of Method 5, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A. A spirometer, or equivalent, may be used in 
place of the wet test meter in the system. Run the pump for at least 5 
minutes at a flow rate of about 10 liters/min (0.35 cfm) to condition 
the interior surface of the wet test meter. The pressure drop indicated 
by the manometer at the inlet side of the DGM should be minimized (no 
greater than 100 mm H<INF>2</INF>O [4 in. H<INF>2</INF>O] at a flow rate 
of 30 liters/min [1 cfm]). This can be accomplished by using large-
diameter tubing connections and straight pipe fittings.
    16.1.1.3 Collect the data as shown in the example data sheet (see 
Figure 5-8 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A). Make triplicate 
runs at each of the flow rates and at no less than five different flow 
rates. The range of flow rates should be between 10 and 34 liters/min 
(0.35 and 1.2 cfm) or over the expected operating range.
    16.1.1.4 Calculate flow rate, Q, for each run using the wet test 
meter volume, V<INF>w</INF>, and the run time, q. Calculate the DGM 
coefficient, Y<INF>ds</INF>, for each run. These calculations are as 
follows:

Where

K<INF>1</INF> = 0.3858 for international system of units (SI); 17.64 for 
English units;

[[Page 456]]

P<INF>bar</INF> = Barometric pressure, mm Hg (in Hg);
V<INF>w</INF> = Wet test meter volume, liter (ft\3\);
t<INF>w</INF> = Average wet test meter temperature, [deg]C ([deg]F);
t<INF>std</INF> = 273 [deg]C for SI units; 460 [deg]F for English units;
[Theta] = Run time, min;
t<INF>ds</INF> = Average dry gas meter temperature, [deg]C ([deg]F);
V<INF>ds</INF> = Dry gas meter volume, liter (ft\3\);
[Delta]p = Dry gas meter inlet differential pressure, mm H<INF>2</INF>O 
(in H<INF>2</INF>O).

    16.1.1.5 Compare the three Y<INF>ds</INF> values at each of the flow 
rates and determine the maximum and minimum values. The difference 
between the maximum and minimum values at each flow rate should be no 
greater than 0.030. Extra sets of triplicate runs may be made in order 
to complete this requirement. In addition, the meter coefficients should 
be between 0.95 and 1.05. If these specifications cannot be met in three 
sets of successive triplicate runs, the meter is not suitable as a 
calibration standard and should not be used as such. If these 
specifications are met, average the three Y<INF>ds</INF> values at each 
flow rate resulting in five average meter coefficients, Y<INF>ds</INF>.
    16.1.1.6 Prepare a curve of meter coefficient, Y<INF>ds</INF>, 
versus flow rate, Q, for the DGM. This curve shall be used as a 
reference when the meter is used to calibrate other DGMs and to 
determine whether recalibration is required.
    16.1.2 Standard dry gas meter recalibration.
    16.1.2.1 Recalibrate the standard DGM against a wet test meter or 
spirometer annually or after every 200 hours of operation, whichever 
comes first. This requirement is valid provided the standard DGM is kept 
in a laboratory and, if transported, cared for as any other laboratory 
instrument. Abuse to the standard meter may cause a change in the 
calibration and will require more frequent recalibrations.
    16.1.2.2 As an alternative to full recalibration, a two-point 
calibration check may be made. Follow the same procedure and equipment 
arrangement as for a full recalibration, but run the meter at only two 
flow rates (suggested rates are 14 and 28 liters/min [0.5 and 1.0 cfm]). 
Calculate the meter coefficients for these two points, and compare the 
values with the meter calibration curve. If the two coefficients are 
within 1.5 percent of the calibration curve values at the same flow 
rates, the meter need not be recalibrated until the next date for a 
recalibration check.
    6.2 Critical orifices as calibration standards. Critical orifices 
may be used as calibration standards in place of the wet test meter 
specified in section 10.3 of this method, provided that they are 
selected, calibrated, and used as follows:
    16.2.1 Selection of critical orifices.
    16.2.1.1 The procedure that follows describes the use of hypodermic 
needles or stainless steel needle tubing that has been found suitable 
for use as critical orifices. Other materials and critical orifice 
designs may be used provided the orifices act as true critical orifices; 
i.e., a critical vacuum can be obtained, as described in section 
7.2.2.2.3 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Select five critical 
orifices that are appropriately sized to cover the range of flow rates 
between 10 and 34 liters/min or the expected operating range. Two of the 
critical orifices should bracket the expected operating range. A minimum 
of three critical orifices will be needed to calibrate a Method 5 DGM; 
the other two critical orifices can serve as spares and provide better 
selection for bracketing the range of operating flow rates. The needle 
sizes and tubing lengths shown in Table 315-1 give the approximate flow 
rates indicated in the table.
    16.2.1.2 These needles can be adapted to a Method 5 type sampling 
train as follows: Insert a serum bottle stopper, 13x20 mm sleeve type, 
into a 0.5 in Swagelok quick connect. Insert the needle into the stopper 
as shown in Figure 5-9 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    16.2.2 Critical orifice calibration. The procedure described in this 
section uses the Method 5 meter box configuration with a DGM as 
described in section 6.1.1.9 of this method to calibrate the critical 
orifices. Other schemes may be used, subject to the approval of the 
Administrator.
    16.2.2.1 Calibration of meter box. The critical orifices must be 
calibrated in the same configuration as they will be used; i.e., there 
should be no connections to the inlet of the orifice.
    16.2.2.1.1 Before calibrating the meter box, leak-check the system 
as follows: Fully open the coarse adjust valve and completely close the 
bypass valve. Plug the inlet. Then turn on the pump and determine 
whether there is any leakage. The leakage rate shall be zero; i.e., no 
detectable movement of the DGM dial shall be seen for 1 minute.
    16.2.2.1.2 Check also for leakages in that portion of the sampling 
train between the pump and the orifice meter. See section 5.6 of Method 
5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A for the procedure; make any corrections, 
if necessary. If leakage is detected, check for cracked gaskets, loose 
fittings, worn 0-rings, etc. and make the necessary repairs.
    16.2.2.1.3 After determining that the meter box is leakless, 
calibrate the meter box according to the procedure given in section 5.3 
of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Make sure that the wet test 
meter meets the requirements stated in section 7.1.1.1 of Method 5, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A. Check the water level in the wet test meter. 
Record the DGM calibration factor, Y.

[[Page 457]]

    16.2.2.2 Calibration of critical orifices. Set up the apparatus as 
shown in Figure 5-10 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    16.2.2.2.1 Allow a warm-up time of 15 minutes. This step is 
important to equilibrate the temperature conditions through the DGM.
    16.2.2.2.2 Leak-check the system as in section 7.2.2.1.1 of Method 
5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. The leakage rate shall be zero.
    16.2.2.2.3 Before calibrating the critical orifice, determine its 
suitability and the appropriate operating vacuum as follows: turn on the 
pump, fully open the coarse adjust valve, and adjust the bypass valve to 
give a vacuum reading corresponding to about half of atmospheric 
pressure. Observe the meter box orifice manometer reading, DH. Slowly 
increase the vacuum reading until a stable reading is obtained on the 
meter box orifice manometer. Record the critical vacuum for each 
orifice. Orifices that do not reach a critical value shall not be used.
    16.2.2.2.4 Obtain the barometric pressure using a barometer as 
described in section 6.1.2 of this method. Record the barometric 
pressure, P<INF>bar</INF>, in mm Hg (in. Hg).
    16.2.2.2.5 Conduct duplicate runs at a vacuum of 25 to 50 mm Hg (1 
to 2 in. Hg) above the critical vacuum. The runs shall be at least 5 
minutes each. The DGM volume readings shall be in increments of complete 
revolutions of the DGM. As a guideline, the times should not differ by 
more than 3.0 seconds (this includes allowance for changes in the DGM 
temperatures) to achieve <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 percent in K'. Record 
the information listed in Figure 5-11 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A.
    16.2.2.2.6 Calculate K' using Equation 315-11.
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07OC97.019
    
where

K' = Critical orifice coefficient, [m\3\)([deg]K)<SUP>1/2</SUP>]/[(mm 
Hg)(min)] [(ft\3\)([deg]R)<SUP>1/2</SUP>)]/[(in. Hg)(min)]
T<INF>amb</INF> = Absolute ambient temperature, [deg]K ([deg]R).

    16.2.2.2.7 Average the K' values. The individual K' values should 
not differ by more than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 percent from the 
average.
    16.2.3 Using the critical orifices as calibration standards.
    16.2.3.1 Record the barometric pressure.
    16.2.3.2 Calibrate the metering system according to the procedure 
outlined in sections 7.2.2.2.1 to 7.2.2.2.5 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A. Record the information listed in Figure 5-12 of Method 5, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A.
    16.2.3.3 Calculate the standard volumes of air passed through the 
DGM and the critical orifices, and calculate the DGM calibration factor, 
Y, using the equations below:

V<INF>m(std)</INF> = K<INF>1</INF> V<INF>m</INF> [P<INF>bar</INF> + 
([Delta]H/13.6)]/T<INF>m</INF> Eq. 315-12
V<INF>cr(std)</INF> = K' (P<INF>bar</INF> [Theta])/
T<INF>amb</INF><SUP>1/2</SUP> Eq. 315-13
Y = V<INF>cr(std)</INF>/V<INF>m(std)</INF> Eq. 315-14
where

V<INF>cr(std)</INF> = Volume of gas sample passed through the critical 
orifice, corrected to standard conditions, dscm (dscf).
K' = 0.3858 [deg]K/mm Hg for metric units
= 17.64 [deg]R/in Hg for English units.

    16.2.3.4 Average the DGM calibration values for each of the flow 
rates. The calibration factor, Y, at each of the flow rates should not 
differ by more than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent from the average.
    16.2.3.5 To determine the need for recalibrating the critical 
orifices, compare the DGM Y factors obtained from two adjacent orifices 
each time a DGM is calibrated; for example, when checking orifice 13/
2.5, use orifices 12/10.2 and 13/5.1. If any critical orifice yields a 
DGM Y factor differing by more than 2 percent from the others, 
recalibrate the critical orifice according to section 7.2.2.2 of Method 
5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.

   Method 316--Sampling and Analysis for Formaldehyde Emissions From 
  Stationary Sources in the Mineral Wool and Wool Fiberglass Industries

                            1.0 Introduction

    This method is applicable to the determination of formaldehyde, CAS 
Registry number 50-00-0, from stationary sources in the mineral wool and 
wool fiber glass industries. High purity water is used to collect the 
formaldehyde. The formaldehyde concentrations in the stack samples are 
determined using the modified pararosaniline method. Formaldehyde can be 
detected as low as 8.8 x 10\10\ lbs/cu ft (11.3 ppbv) or as high as 1.8 
x 10\3\ lbs/cu ft (23,000,000 ppbv), at standard conditions over a 1 
hour sampling period, sampling approximately 30 cu ft.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    Gaseous and particulate pollutants are withdrawn isokinetically from 
an emission source and are collected in high purity water. Formaldehyde 
present in the emissions is highly soluble in high purity water. The 
high purity water containing formaldehyde is then analyzed using the 
modified pararosaniline method. Formaldehyde in the sample reacts with 
acidic pararosaniline, and the sodium sulfite, forming a purple 
chromophore. The intensity of the purple color, measured 
spectrophotometrically, provides an accurate and precise measure of the 
formaldehyde concentration in the sample.

                             3.0 Definitions

    See the definitions in the General Provisions of this Subpart.

                            4.0 Interferences

    Sulfite and cyanide in solution interfere with the pararosaniline 
method. A procedure to overcome the interference by each compound has 
been described by Miksch, et al.

                       6.0 Apparatus and Materials

    6.1 A schematic of the sampling train is shown in Figure 1. This 
sampling train configuration is adapted from EPA Method 5, 40 CFR part 
60, appendix A, procedures.

[[Page 460]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.050

    The sampling train consists of the following components: probe 
nozzle, probe liner, pitot tube, differential pressure gauge, impingers, 
metering system, barometer, and gas density determination equipment.
    6.1.1 Probe Nozzle: Quartz, glass, or stainless steel with sharp, 
tapered (30 [deg] angle) leading edge. The taper shall be on the outside 
to preserve a constant inner diameter. The nozzle shall be buttonhook or 
elbow design. A range of nozzle sizes suitable for isokinetic sampling 
should be available in increments of 0.15 cm (\1/16\ in), e.g., 0.32 to 
1.27 cm (\1/8\ to \1/2\ in), or larger if higher volume sampling trains 
are used. Each nozzle shall be calibrated according to the procedure 
outlined in Section 10.1.
    6.1.2 Probe Liner: Borosilicate glass or quartz shall be used for 
the probe liner. The probe shall be maintained at a temperature of 120 
[deg]C <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>14 [deg]C (248 [deg]F <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>25 [deg]F).
    6.1.3 Pitot Tube: The pitot tube shall be Type S, as described in 
Section 2.1 of EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or any other 
appropriate device. The pitot tube shall be attached to the probe to 
allow constant monitoring of the stack gas velocity. The impact (high 
pressure) opening plane of the pitot tube shall be even with or above 
the nozzle entry plane (see Figure 2-6b, EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A) during sampling. The Type S pitot tube assembly shall have a 
known coefficient, determined as outlined in Section 4 of EPA Method 2, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    6.1.4 Differential Pressure Gauge: The differential pressure gauge 
shall be an inclined manometer or equivalent device as described in 
Section 2.2 of EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. One manometer 
shall be used for velocity-head reading and the other for orifice 
differential pressure readings.
    6.1.5 Impingers: The sampling train requires a minimum of four 
impingers, connected as shown in Figure 1, with ground glass (or 
equivalent) vacuum-tight fittings. For the first, third, and fourth 
impingers, use the Greenburg-Smith design, modified by replacing the tip 
with a 1.3 cm inside diameters (\1/2\ in) glass tube extending to 1.3 cm 
(\1/2\ in) from the bottom of the flask. For the second impinger, use a 
Greenburg-Smith impinger with the standard tip. Place a thermometer 
capable of measuring temperature

[[Page 461]]

to within 1 [deg]C (2 [deg]F) at the outlet of the fourth impinger for 
monitoring purposes.
    6.1.6 Metering System: The necessary components are a vacuum gauge, 
leak-free pump, thermometers capable of measuring temperatures within 3 
[deg]C (5.4 [deg]F), dry-gas meter capable of measuring volume to within 
1 percent, and related equipment as shown in Figure 1. At a minimum, the 
pump should be capable of 4 cfm free flow, and the dry gas meter should 
have a recording capacity of 0-999.9 cu ft with a resolution of 0.005 cu 
ft. Other metering systems may be used which are capable of maintaining 
sample volumes to within 2 percent. The metering system may be used in 
conjunction with a pitot tube to enable checks of isokinetic sampling 
rates.
    6.1.7 Barometer: The barometer may be mercury, aneroid, or other 
barometer capable of measuring atmospheric pressure to within 2.5 mm Hg 
(0.1 in Hg). In many cases, the barometric reading may be obtained from 
a nearby National Weather Service Station, in which case the station 
value (which is the absolute barometric pressure) is requested and an 
adjustment for elevation differences between the weather station and 
sampling point is applied at a rate of minus 2.5 mm Hg (0.1 in Hg) per 
30 m (100 ft) elevation increase (rate is plus 2.5 mm Hg per 30 m (100 
ft) of elevation decrease).
    6.1.8 Gas Density Determination Equipment: Temperature sensor and 
pressure gauge (as described in Sections 2.3 and 2.3 of EPA Method 2, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A), and gas analyzer, if necessary (as described 
in EPA Method 3, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A). The temperature sensor 
ideally should be permanently attached to the pitot tube or sampling 
probe in a fixed configuration such that the top of the sensor extends 
beyond the leading edge of the probe sheath and does not touch any 
metal. Alternatively, the sensor may be attached just prior to use in 
the field. Note, however, that if the temperature sensor is attached in 
the field, the sensor must be placed in an interference-free arrangement 
with respect to the Type S pitot openings (see Figure 2-7, EPA Method 2, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A). As a second alternative, if a difference of 
no more than 1 percent in the average velocity measurement is to be 
introduced, the temperature gauge need not be attached to the probe or 
pitot tube.
    6.2 Sample Recovery
    6.2.1 Probe Liner: Probe nozzle and brushes; bristle brushes with 
stainless steel wire handles are required. The probe brush shall have 
extensions of stainless steel, Teflon \TM\, or inert material at least 
as long as the probe. The brushes shall be properly sized and shaped to 
brush out the probe liner, the probe nozzle, and the impingers.
    6.2.2 Wash Bottles: One wash bottle is required. Polyethylene, 
Teflon \TM\, or glass wash bottles may be used for sample recovery.
    6.2.3 Graduated Cylinder and/or Balance: A graduated cylinder or 
balance is required to measure condensed water to the nearest 1 ml or 1 
g. Graduated cylinders shall have division not <ls-thn-eq>2 ml. 
Laboratory balances capable of weighing to <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 g 
are required.
    6.2.4 Polyethylene Storage Containers: 500 ml wide-mouth 
polyethylene bottles are required to store impinger water samples.
    6.2.5 Rubber Policeman and Funnel: A rubber policeman and funnel are 
required to aid the transfer of material into and out of containers in 
the field.
    6.3 Sample Analysis
    6.3.1 Spectrophotometer--B&L 70, 710, 2000, etc., or equivalent; 1 
cm pathlength cuvette holder.
    6.3.2 Disposable polystyrene cuvettes, pathlengh 1 cm, volume of 
about 4.5 ml.
    6.3.3 Pipettors--Fixed-volume Oxford pipet (250 [micro]l; 500 
[micro]l; 1000 [micro]l); adjustable volume Oxford or equivalent 
pipettor 1-5 ml model, set to 2.50 ml.
    6.3.4 Pipet tips for pipettors above.
    6.3.5 Parafilm, 2 [deg] wide; cut into about 1'' squares.

                              7.0 Reagents

    7.1 High purity water: All references to water in this method refer 
to high purity water (ASTM Type I water or equivalent). The water purity 
will dictate the lower limits of formaldehyde quantification.
    7.2 Silica Gel: Silica gel shall be indicting type, 6-16 mesh. If 
the silica gel has been used previously, dry at 175 [deg]C (350 [deg]F) 
for 2 hours before using. New silica gel may be used as received. 
Alternatively, other types of desiccants (equivalent or better) may be 
used.
    7.3 Crushed Ice: Quantities ranging from 10-50 lbs may be necessary 
during a sampling run, depending upon ambient temperature. Samples which 
have been taken must be stored and shipped cold; sufficient ice for this 
purpose must be allowed.
    7.4 Quaternary ammonium compound stock solution: Prepare a stock 
solution of dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (98 percent minimum assay, 
reagent grade) by dissolving 1.0 gram in 1000 ml water. This solution 
contains nominally 1000 [micro]g/ml quaternary ammonium compound, and is 
used as a biocide for some sources which are prone to microbial 
contamination.
    7.5 Pararosaniline: Weigh 0.16 grams pararosaniline (free base; 
assay of 95 percent or greater, C.I. 42500; Sigma P7632 has been found 
to be acceptable) into a 100 ml flask. Exercise care, since 
pararosaniline is a dye and will stain. Using a wash bottle with high-
purity water, rinse the walls of the flask. Add no more than 25 ml 
water. Then,

[[Page 462]]

carefully add 20 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid to the flask. The 
flask will become warm after the addition of acid. Add a magnetic stir 
bar to the flask, cap, and place on a magnetic stirrer for approximately 
4 hours. Then, add additional water so the total volume is 100 ml. This 
solution is stable for several months when stored tightly capped at room 
temperature.
    7.6 Sodium sulfite: Weigh 0.10 grams anhydrous sodium sulfite into a 
100 ml flask. Dilute to the mark with high purity water. Invert 15-20 
times to mix and dissolve the sodium sulfite. This solution must be 
prepared fresh every day.
    7.7 Formaldehyde standard solution: Pipet exactly 2.70 ml of 37 
percent formaldehyde solution into a 1000 ml volumetric flask which 
contains about 500 ml of high-purity water. Dilute to the mark with 
high-purity water. This solution contains nominally 1000 [micro]g/ml of 
formaldehyde, and is used to prepare the working formaldehyde standards. 
The exact formaldehyde concentration may be determined if needed by 
suitable modification of the sodium sulfite method (Reference: J.F. 
Walker, Formaldehyde (Third Edition), 1964.). The 1000 [micro]g/ml 
formaldehyde stock solution is stable for at least a year if kept 
tightly closed, with the neck of the flask sealed with Parafilm. Store 
at room temperature.
    7.8 Working formaldehyde standards: Pipet exactly 10.0 ml of the 
1000 [micro]g/ml formaldehyde stock solution into a 100 ml volumetric 
flask which is about half full of high-purity water. Dilute to the mark 
with high-purity water, and invert 15-20 times to mix thoroughly. This 
solution contains nominally 100 [micro]g/ml formaldehyde. Prepare the 
working standards from this 100 [micro]g/ml standard solution and using 
the Oxford pipets:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                [micro]L or     flask

                                                                water)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.250.........................................          250          100
0.500.........................................          500          100
1.00..........................................         1000          100
2.00..........................................         2000          100
3.00..........................................         1500           50
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 100 [micro]g/ml stock solution is stable for 4 weeks if kept 
refrigerated between analyses. The working standards (0.25-3.00 
[micro]g/ml) should be prepared fresh every day, consistent with good 
laboratory practice for trace analysis. If the laboratory water is not 
of sufficient purity, it may be necessary to prepare the working 
standards every day. The laboratory must establish that the working 
standards are stable--DO NOT assume that your working standards are 
stable for more than a day unless you have verified this by actual 
testing for several series of working standards.

                          8.0 Sample Collection

    8.1 Because of the complexity of this method, field personnel should 
be trained in and experienced with the test procedures in order to 
obtain reliable results.

                       8.2 Laboratory Preparation

    8.2.1 All the components shall be maintained and calibrated 
according to the procedure described in APTD-0576, unless otherwise 
specified.
    8.2.2 Weigh several 200 to 300 g portions of silica gel in airtight 
containers to the nearest 0.5 g. Record on each container the total 
weight of the silica gel plus containers. As an alternative to 
preweighing the silica gel, it may instead be weighed directly in the 
impinger or sampling holder just prior to train assembly.
    8.3 Preliminary Field Determinations
    8.3.1 Select the sampling site and the minimum number of sampling 
points according to EPA Method 1, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or other 
relevant criteria. Determine the stack pressure, temperature, and range 
of velocity heads using EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. A 
leak-check of the pitot lines according to Section 3.1 of EPA Method 2, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A, must be performed. Determine the stack gas 
moisture content using EPA Approximation Method 4,40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A, or its alternatives to establish estimates of isokinetic 
sampling rate settings. Determine the stack gas dry molecular weight, as 
described in EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Section 3.6. If 
integrated EPA Method 3, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, sampling is used 
for molecular weight determination, the integrated bag sample shall be 
taken simultaneously with, and for the same total length of time as, the 
sample run.
    8.3.2 Select a nozzle size based on the range of velocity heads so 
that it is not necessary to change the nozzle size in order to maintain 
isokinetic sampling rates below 28 l/min (1.0 cfm). During the run do 
not change the nozzle. Ensure that the proper differential pressure 
gauge is chosen for the range of velocity heads encountered (see Section 
2.2 of EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A).
    8.3.3 Select a suitable probe liner and probe length so that all 
traverse points can be sampled. For large stacks, to reduce the length 
of the probe, consider sampling from opposite sides of the stack.
    8.3.4 A minimum of 30 cu ft of sample volume is suggested for 
emission sources with stack concentrations not greater than 23,000,000 
ppbv. Additional sample volume shall be collected as necessitated by the 
capacity of the water reagent and analytical detection limit constraint. 
Reduced sample volume may be collected as long as the final 
concentration of formaldehyde in the stack

[[Page 463]]

sample is greater than 10 (ten) times the detection limit.
    8.3.5 Determine the total length of sampling time needed to obtain 
the identified minimum volume by comparing the anticipated average 
sampling rate with the volume requirement. Allocate the same time to all 
traverse points defined by EPA Method 1, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. To 
avoid timekeeping errors, the length of time sampled at each traverse 
point should be an integer or an integer plus 0.5 min.
    8.3.6 In some circumstances (e.g., batch cycles) it may be necessary 
to sample for shorter times at the traverse points and to obtain smaller 
gas-volume samples. In these cases, careful documentation must be 
maintained in order to allow accurate calculations of concentrations.
    8.4 Preparation of Collection Train
    8.4.1 During preparation and assembly of the sampling train, keep 
all openings where contamination can occur covered with Teflon\TM\ film 
or aluminum foil until just prior to assembly or until sampling is about 
to begin.
    8.4.2 Place 100 ml of water in each of the first two impingers, and 
leave the third impinger empty. If additional capacity is required for 
high expected concentrations of formaldehyde in the stack gas, 200 ml of 
water per impinger may be used or additional impingers may be used for 
sampling. Transfer approximately 200 to 300 g of pre-weighed silica gel 
from its container to the fourth impinger. Care should be taken to 
ensure that the silica gel is not entrained and carried out from the 
impinger during sampling. Place the silica gel container in a clean 
place for later use in the sample recovery. Alternatively, the weight of 
the silica gel plus impinger may be determined to the nearest 0.5 g and 
recorded.
    8.4.3 With a glass or quartz liner, install the selected nozzle 
using a Viton-A O-ring when stack temperatures are <260 [deg]C (500 
[deg]F) and a woven glass-fiber gasket when temperatures are higher. See 
APTD-0576 for details. Other connection systems utilizing either 316 
stainless steel or Teflon\TM\ ferrules may be used. Mark the probe with 
heat-resistant tape or by some other method to denote the proper 
distance into the stack or duct for each sampling point.
    8.4.4 Assemble the train as shown in Figure 1. During assembly, a 
very light coating of silicone grease may be used on ground-glass joints 
of the impingers, but the silicone grease should be limited to the outer 
portion (see APTD-0576) of the ground-glass joints to minimize silicone 
grease contamination. If necessary, Teflon\TM\ tape may be used to seal 
leaks. Connect all temperature sensors to an appropriate potentiometer/
display unit. Check all temperature sensors at ambient temperatures.
    8.4.5 Place crushed ice all around the impingers.
    8.4.6 Turn on and set the probe heating system at the desired 
operating temperature. Allow time for the temperature to stabilize.
    8.5 Leak-Check Procedures
    8.5.1 Pre-test Leak-check: Recommended, but not required. If the 
tester elects to conduct the pre-test leak-check, the following 
procedure shall be used.
    8.5.1.1 After the sampling train has been assembled, turn on and set 
probe heating system at the desired operating temperature. Allow time 
for the temperature to stabilize. If a Viton-a O-ring or other leak-free 
connection is used in assembling the probe nozzle to the probe liner, 
leak-check the train at the sampling site by plugging the nozzle and 
pulling a 381 mm Hg (15 in Hg) vacuum.

    Note: A lower vacuum may be used, provided that the lower vacuum is 
not exceeded during the test.

    If a woven glass fiber gasket is used, do not connect the probe to 
the train during the leak-check. Instead, leak-check the train by first 
attaching a carbon-filled leak-check impinger to the inlet and then 
plugging the inlet and pulling a 381 mm Hg (15 in Hg) vacuum. (A lower 
vacuum may be used if this lower vacuum is not exceeded during the 
test.) Next connect the probe to the train and leak-check at about 25 mm 
Hg (1 in Hg) vacuum. Alternatively, leak-check the probe with the rest 
of the sampling train in one step at 381 mm Hg (15 in Hg) vacuum. 
Leakage rates in excess of (a) 4 percent of the average sampling rate or 
(b) 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm), whichever is less, are unacceptable.
    8.5.1.2 The following leak-check instructions for the sampling train 
described in APTD-0576 and APTD-0581 may be helpful. Start the pump with 
the fine-adjust valve fully open and coarse-valve completely closed. 
Partially open the coarse-adjust valve and slowly close the fine-adjust 
valve until the desired vacuum is reached. Do not reverse direction of 
the fine-adjust valve, as liquid will back up into the train. If the 
desired vacuum is exceeded, either perform the leak-check at this higher 
vacuum or end the leak-check, as described below, and start over.
    8.5.1.3 When the leak-check is completed, first slowly remove the 
plug from the inlet to the probe. When the vacuum drops to 127 mm (5 in) 
Hg or less, immediately close the coarse-adjust valve. Switch off the 
pumping system and reopen the fine-adjust valve. Do not reopen the fine-
adjust valve until the coarse-adjust valve has been closed to prevent 
the liquid in the impingers from being forced backward in the sampling 
line and silica gel from being entrained backward into the third 
impinger.
    8.5.2 Leak-checks During Sampling Run:

[[Page 464]]

    8.5.2.1 If, during the sampling run, a component change (e.g., 
impinger) becomes necessary, a leak-check shall be conducted immediately 
after the interruption of sampling and before the change is made. The 
leak-check shall be done according to the procedure described in Section 
10.3.3, except that it shall be done at a vacuum greater than or equal 
to the maximum value recorded up to that point in the test. If the 
leakage rate is found to be no greater than 0.0057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm) 
or 4 percent of the average sampling rate (whichever is less), the 
results are acceptable. If a higher leakage rate is obtained, the tester 
must void the sampling run.

    Note: Any correction of the sample volume by calculation reduces the 
integrity of the pollutant concentration data generated and must be 
avoided.

    8.5.2.2 Immediately after component changes, leak-checks are 
optional. If performed, the procedure described in section 8.5.1.1 shall 
be used.
    8.5.3 Post-test Leak-check:
    8.5.3.1 A leak-check is mandatory at the conclusion of each sampling 
run. The leak-check shall be done with the same procedures as the pre-
test leak-check, except that the post-test leak-check shall be conducted 
at a vacuum greater than or equal to the maximum value reached during 
the sampling run. If the leakage rate is found to be no greater than 
0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm) or 4 percent of the average sampling rate 
(whichever is less), the results are acceptable. If, however, a higher 
leakage rate is obtained, the tester shall record the leakage rate and 
void the sampling run.
    8.6 Sampling Train Operation
    8.6.1 During the sampling run, maintain an isokinetic sampling rate 
to within 10 percent of true isokinetic, below 28 l/min (1.0 cfm). 
Maintain a temperature around the probe of 120 [deg]C <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>14 [deg]C (248 [deg] <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>25 [deg]F).
    8.6.2 For each run, record the data on a data sheet such as the one 
shown in Figure 2. Be sure to record the initial dry-gas meter reading. 
Record the dry-gas meter readings at the beginning and end of each 
sampling time increment, when changes in flow rates are made, before and 
after each leak-check, and when sampling is halted. Take other readings 
required by Figure 2 at least once at each sample point during each time 
increment and additional readings when significant adjustments (20 
percent variation in velocity head readings) necessitate additional 
adjustments in flow rate. Level and zero the manometer. Because the 
manometer level and zero may drift due to vibrations and temperature 
changes, make periodic checks during the traverse.

    8.6.3 Clean the stack access ports prior to the test run to 
eliminate the chance of sampling deposited material. To begin sampling, 
remove the nozzle cap, verify that the probe heating system are at the 
specified temperature, and verify that the pitot tube and probe are 
properly positioned. Position the nozzle at the first traverse point, 
with the tip pointing directly into the gas stream. Immediately start 
the pump and adjust the flow to isokinetic conditions. Nomographs, which 
aid in the rapid adjustment of the isokinetic sampling rate without 
excessive computations, are available. These nomographs are designed for 
use when the Type S pitot tube coefficient is 0.84 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.02 and the stack gas equivalent density (dry molecular 
weight) is equal to 29 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>4. APTD-0576 details the 
procedure for using the nomographs. If the stack gas molecular weight 
and the pitot tube coefficient are outside the above ranges, do not use 
the nomographs unless appropriate steps are taken to compensate for the 
deviations.
    8.6.4 When the stack is under significant negative pressure 
(equivalent to the height of the impinger stem), take care to close the 
coarse-adjust valve before inserting the probe into the stack in order 
to prevent liquid from backing up through the train. If necessary, a low 
vacuum on the train may have to be started prior to entering the stack.
    8.6.5 When the probe is in position, block off the openings around 
the probe and stack access port to prevent unrepresentative dilution of 
the gas stream.
    8.6.6 Traverse the stack cross section, as required by EPA Method 1, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A, being careful not to bump the probe nozzle 
into the stack walls when sampling near the walls or when removing or 
inserting the probe through the access port, in order to minimize the 
chance of extracting deposited material.
    8.6.7 During the test run, make periodic adjustments to keep the 
temperature around the probe at the proper levels. Add more ice and, if 
necessary, salt, to maintain a temperature of <20 [deg]C (68 [deg]F) at 
the silica gel outlet.
    8.6.8 A single train shall be used for the entire sampling run, 
except in cases where simultaneous sampling is required in two or more 
separate ducts or at two or more different locations within the same 
duct, or in cases where equipment failure necessitates a change of 
trains. An additional train or trains may also be used for sampling when 
the capacity of a single train is exceeded.
    8.6.9 When two or more trains are used, separate analyses of 
components from each train shall be performed. If multiple trains have 
been used because the capacity of a single train would be exceeded, 
first impingers from each train may be combined, and second impingers 
from each train may be combined.
    8.6.10 At the end of the sampling run, turn off the coarse-adjust 
valve, remove the probe and nozzle from the stack, turn off the pump, 
record the final dry gas meter reading, and conduct a post-test leak-
check. Also, check the pitot lines as described in EPA Method 2, 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A. The lines must pass this leak-check in order to 
validate the velocity-head data.
    8.6.11 Calculate percent isokineticity (see Method 2) to determine 
whether the run was valid or another test should be made.
    8.7 Sample Preservation and Handling
    8.7.1 Samples from most sources applicable to this method have 
acceptable holding times using normal handling practices (shipping 
samples iced, storing in refrigerator at 2 [deg]C until analysis). 
However, forming section stacks and other sources using waste water 
sprays may be subject to microbial contamination. For these sources, a 
biocide (quaternary ammonium compound solution) may be added to 
collected samples to improve sample stability and method ruggedness.
    8.7.2 Sample holding time: Samples should be analyzed within 14 days 
of collection. Samples must be refrigerated/kept cold for the entire 
period preceding analysis. After the samples have been brought to room

[[Page 467]]

temperature for analysis, any analyses needed should be performed on the 
same day. Repeated cycles of warming the samples to room temperature/
refrigerating/rewarming, then analyzing again, etc., have not been 
investigated in depth to evaluate if analyte levels remain stable for 
all sources.
    8.7.3 Additional studies will be performed to evaluate whether 
longer sample holding times are feasible for this method.
    8.8 Sample Recovery
    8.8.1 Preparation:
    8.8.1.1 Proper cleanup procedure begins as soon as the probe is 
removed from the stack at the end of the sampling period. Allow the 
probe to cool. When the probe can be handled safely, wipe off all 
external particulate matter near the tip of the probe nozzle and place a 
cap over the tip to prevent losing or gaining particulate matter. Do not 
cap the probe tightly while the sampling train is cooling because a 
vacuum will be created, drawing liquid from the impingers back through 
the sampling train.
    8.8.1.2 Before moving the sampling train to the cleanup site, remove 
the probe from the sampling train and cap the open outlet, being careful 
not to lose any condensate that might be present. Remove the umbilical 
cord from the last impinger and cap the impinger. If a flexible line is 
used, let any condensed water or liquid drain into the impingers. Cap 
off any open impinger inlets and outlets. Ground glass stoppers, Teflon 
\TM\ caps, or caps of other inert materials may be used to seal all 
openings.
    8.8.1.3 Transfer the probe and impinger assembly to an area that is 
clean and protected from wind so that the chances of contaminating or 
losing the sample are minimized.
    8.8.1.4 Inspect the train before and during disassembly, and note 
any abnormal conditions.
    8.8.1.5 Save a portion of the washing solution (high purity water) 
used for cleanup as a blank.
    8.8.2 Sample Containers:
    8.8.2.1 Container 1: Probe and Impinger Catches. Using a graduated 
cylinder, measure to the nearest ml, and record the volume of the 
solution in the first three impingers. Alternatively, the solution may 
be weighed to the nearest 0.5 g. Include any condensate in the probe in 
this determination. Transfer the combined impinger solution from the 
graduated cylinder into the polyethylene bottle. Taking care that dust 
on the outside of the probe or other exterior surfaces does not get into 
the sample, clean all surfaces to which the sample is exposed (including 
the probe nozzle, probe fitting, probe liner, first three impingers, and 
impinger connectors) with water. Use less than 400 ml for the entire 
waste (250 ml would be better, if possible). Add the rinse water to the 
sample container.
    8.8.2.1.1 Carefully remove the probe nozzle and rinse the inside 
surface with water from a wash bottle. Brush with a bristle brush and 
rinse until the rinse shows no visible particles, after which make a 
final rinse of the inside surface. Brush and rinse the inside parts of 
the Swagelok (or equivalent) fitting with water in a similar way.
    8.8.2.1.2 Rinse the probe liner with water. While squirting the 
water into the upper end of the probe, tilt and rotate the probe so that 
all inside surfaces will be wetted with water. Let the water drain from 
the lower end into the sample container. The tester may use a funnel 
(glass or polyethylene) to aid in transferring the liquid washes to the 
container. Follow the rinse with a bristle brush. Hold the probe in an 
inclined position, and squirt water into the upper end as the probe 
brush is being pushed with a twisting action through the probe. Hold the 
sample container underneath the lower end of the probe, and catch any 
water and particulate matter that is brushed from the probe. Run the 
brush through the probe three times or more. Rinse the brush with water 
and quantitatively collect these washings in the sample container. After 
the brushing, make a final rinse of the probe as describe above.

    Note: Two people should clean the probe in order to minimize sample 
losses. Between sampling runs, brushes must be kept clean and free from 
contamination.

    8.8.2.1.3 Rinse the inside surface of each of the first three 
impingers (and connecting tubing) three separate times. Use a small 
portion of water for each rinse, and brush each surface to which the 
sample is exposed with a bristle brush to ensure recovery of fine 
particulate matter. Make a final rinse of each surface and of the brush, 
using water.
    8.8.2.1.4 After all water washing and particulate matter have been 
collected in the sample container, tighten the lid so the sample will 
not leak out when the container is shipped to the laboratory. Mark the 
height of the fluid level to determine whether leakage occurs during 
transport. Label the container clearly to identify its contents.
    8.8.2.1.5 If the first two impingers are to be analyzed separately 
to check for breakthrough, separate the contents and rinses of the two 
impingers into individual containers. Care must be taken to avoid 
physical carryover from the first impinger to the second. Any physical 
carryover of collected moisture into the second impinger will invalidate 
a breakthrough assessment.
    8.8.2.2 Container 2: Sample Blank. Prepare a blank by using a 
polyethylene container and adding a volume of water equal to the total 
volume in Container 1. Process the blank in the same manner as Container 
1.
    8.8.2.3 Container 3: Silica Gel. Note the color of the indicating 
silica gel to determine whether it has been completely spent

[[Page 468]]

and make a notation of its condition. The impinger containing the silica 
gel may be used as a sample transport container with both ends sealed 
with tightly fitting caps or plugs. Ground-glass stoppers or Teflon \TM\ 
caps maybe used. The silica gel impinger should then be labeled, covered 
with aluminum foil, and packaged on ice for transport to the laboratory. 
If the silica gel is removed from the impinger, the tester may use a 
funnel to pour the silica gel and a rubber policeman to remove the 
silica gel from the impinger. It is not necessary to remove the small 
amount of dust particles that may adhere to the impinger wall and are 
difficult to remove. Since the gain in weight is to be used for moisture 
calculations, do not use water or other liquids to transfer the silica 
gel. If a balance is available in the field, the spent silica gel (or 
silica gel plus impinger) may be weighed to the nearest 0.5 g.
    8.8.2.4 Sample containers should be placed in a cooler, cooled by 
(although not in contact with) ice. Putting sample bottles in Zip-Lock 
\TM\ bags can aid in maintaining the integrity of the sample labels. 
Sample containers should be placed vertically to avoid leakage during 
shipment. Samples should be cooled during shipment so they will be 
received cold at the laboratory. It is critical that samples be chilled 
immediately after recovery. If the source is susceptible to microbial 
contamination from wash water (e.g. forming section stack), add biocide 
as directed in section 8.2.5.
    8.8.2.5 A quaternary ammonium compound can be used as a biocide to 
stabilize samples against microbial degradation following collection. 
Using the stock quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) solution; add 2.5 ml 
QAC solution for every 100 ml of recovered sample volume (estimate of 
volume is satisfactory) immediately after collection. The total volume 
of QAC solution must be accurately known and recorded, to correct for 
any dilution caused by the QAC solution addition.
    8.8.3 Sample Preparation for Analysis 8.8.3.1 The sample should be 
refrigerated if the analysis will not be performed on the day of 
sampling. Allow the sample to warm at room temperature for about two 
hours (if it has been refrigerated) prior to analyzing.
    8.8.3.2 Analyze the sample by the pararosaniline method, as 
described in Section 11. If the color-developed sample has an absorbance 
above the highest standard, a suitable dilution in high purity water 
should be prepared and analyzed.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 Sampling: See EPA Manual 600/4-77-02b for Method 5 quality 
control.
    9.2 Analysis: The quality assurance program required for this method 
includes the analysis of the field and method blanks, and procedure 
validations. The positive identification and quantitation of 
formaldehyde are dependent on the integrity of the samples received and 
the precision and accuracy of the analytical methodology. Quality 
assurance procedures for this method are designed to monitor the 
performance of the analytical methodology and to provide the required 
information to take corrective action if problems are observed in 
laboratory operations or in field sampling activities.
    9.2.1 Field Blanks: Field blanks must be submitted with the samples 
collected at each sampling site. The field blanks include the sample 
bottles containing aliquots of sample recover water, and water reagent. 
At a minimum, one complete sampling train will be assembled in the field 
staging area, taken to the sampling area, and leak-checked at the 
beginning and end of the testing (or for the same total number of times 
as the actual sampling train). The probe of the blank train must be 
heated during the sample test. The train will be recovered as if it were 
an actual test sample. No gaseous sample will be passed through the 
blank sampling train.
    9.2.2 Blank Correction: The field blank formaldehyde concentrations 
will be subtracted from the appropriate sample formaldehyde 
concentrations. Blank formaldehyde concentrations above 0.25 [micro]g/ml 
should be considered suspect, and subtraction from the sample 
formaldehyde concentrations should be performed in a manner acceptable 
to the Administrator.
    9.2.3 Method Blanks: A method blank must be prepared for each set of 
analytical operations, to evaluate contamination and artifacts that can 
be derived from glassware, reagents, and sample handling in the 
laboratory.

                             10 Calibration

    10.1 Probe Nozzle: Probe nozzles shall be calibrated before their 
initial use in the field. Using a micrometer, measure the inside 
diameter of the nozzle to the nearest 0.025 mm (0.001 in). Make 
measurements at three separate places across the diameter and obtain the 
average of the measurements. The difference between the high and low 
numbers shall not exceed 0.1 mm (0.004 in). When the nozzle becomes 
nicked or corroded, it shall be repaired and calibrated, or replaced 
with a calibrated nozzle before use. Each nozzle must be permanently and 
uniquely identified.
    10.2 Pitot Tube: The Type S pitot tube assembly shall be calibrated 
according to the procedure outlined in Section 4 of EPA Method 2, or 
assigned a nominal coefficient of 0.84 if it is not visibly nicked or 
corroded and if it meets design and intercomponent spacing 
specifications.
    10.3 Metering System
    10.3.1 Before its initial use in the field, the metering system 
shall be calibrated according to the procedure outlined in APTD-

[[Page 469]]

0576. Instead of physically adjusting the dry-gas meter dial readings to 
correspond to the wet-test meter readings, calibration factors may be 
used to correct the gas meter dial readings mathematically to the proper 
values. Before calibrating the metering system, it is suggested that a 
leak-check be conducted. For metering systems having diaphragm pumps, 
the normal leak-check procedure will not delete leakages with the pump. 
For these cases, the following leak-check procedure will apply: Make a 
ten-minute calibration run at 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm). At the end of 
the run, take the difference of the measured wet-test and dry-gas meter 
volumes and divide the difference by 10 to get the leak rate. The leak 
rate should not exceed 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm).
    10.3.2 After each field use, check the calibration of the metering 
system by performing three calibration runs at a single intermediate 
orifice setting (based on the previous field test). Set the vacuum at 
the maximum value reached during the test series. To adjust the vacuum, 
insert a valve between the wet-test meter and the inlet of the metering 
system. Calculate the average value of the calibration factor. If the 
calibration has changed by more than 5 percent, recalibrate the meter 
over the full range of orifice settings, as outlined in APTD-0576.
    10.3.3 Leak-check of metering system: The portion of the sampling 
train from the pump to the orifice meter (see Figure 1) should be leak-
checked prior to initial use and after each shipment. Leakage after the 
pump will result in less volume being recorded than is actually sampled. 
Use the following procedure: Close the main valve on the meter box. 
Insert a one-hole rubber stopper with rubber tubing attached into the 
orifice exhaust pipe. Disconnect and vent the low side of the orifice 
manometer. Close off the low side orifice tap. Pressurize the system to 
13-18 cm (5-7 in) water column by blowing into the rubber tubing. Pinch 
off the tubing and observe the manometer for 1 min. A loss of pressure 
on the manometer indicates a leak in the meter box. Leaks must be 
corrected.

    Note: If the dry-gas meter coefficient values obtained before and 
after a test series differ by <ls-thn-eq>5 percent, either the test 
series must be voided or calculations for test series must be performed 
using whichever meter coefficient value (i.e., before or after) gives 
the lower value of total sample volume.

    10.4 Probe Heater: The probe heating system must be calibrated 
before its initial use in the field according to the procedure outlined 
in APTD-0576. Probes constructed according to APTD-0581 need not be 
calibrated if the calibration curves in APTD-0576 are used.
    10.5 Temperature gauges: Use the procedure in section 4.3 of USEPA 
Method 2 to calibrate in-stack temperature gauges. Dial thermometers 
such as are used for the dry gas meter and condenser outlet, shall be 
calibrated against mercury-in-glass thermometers.
    10.6 Barometer: Adjust the barometer initially and before each test 
series to agree to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.5 mm Hg (0.1 in Hg) of 
the mercury barometer. Alternately, if a National Weather Service 
Station (NWSS) is located at the same altitude above sea level as the 
test site, the barometric pressure reported by the NWSS may be used.
    10.7 Balance: Calibrate the balance before each test series, using 
Class S standard weights. The weights must be within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 percent of the standards, or the balance must be 
adjusted to meet these limits.

                       11.0 Procedure for Analysis

    The working formaldehyde standards (0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 
[micro]g/ml) are analyzed and a calibration curve is calculated for each 
day's analysis. The standards should be analyzed first to ensure that 
the method is working properly prior to analyzing the samples. In 
addition, a sample of the high-purity water should also be analyzed and 
used as a ``0'' formaldehyde standard.
    The procedure for analysis of samples and standards is identical: 
Using the pipet set to 2.50 ml, pipet 2.50 ml of the solution to be 
analyzed into a polystyrene cuvette. Using the 250 [micro]l pipet, pipet 
250 [micro]l of the pararosaniline reagent solution into the cuvette. 
Seal the top of the cuvette with a Parafilm square and shake at least 30 
seconds to ensure the solution in the cuvette is well-mixed. Peel back a 
corner of the Parafilm so the next reagent can be added. Using the 250 
[micro]l pipet, pipet 250 [micro]l of the sodium sulfite reagent 
solution into the cuvette. Reseal the cuvette with the Parafilm, and 
again shake for about 30 seconds to mix the solution in the cuvette. 
Record the time of addition of the sodium sulfite and let the color 
develop at room temperature for 60 minutes. Set the spectrophotometer to 
570 nm and set to read in Absorbance Units. The spectrophotometer should 
be equipped with a holder for the 1-cm pathlength cuvettes. Place 
cuvette(s) containing high-purity water in the spectrophotometer and 
adjust to read 0.000 AU.
    After the 60 minutes color development period, read the standard and 
samples in the spectrophotometer. Record the absorbance reading for each 
cuvette. The calibration curve is calculated by linear regression, with 
the formaldehyde concentration as the ``x'' coordinate of the pair, and 
the absorbance reading as the ``y'' coordinate. The procedure is very 
reproducible, and typically will yield values similar to these for the 
calibration curve:

Correlation Coefficient: 0.9999

[[Page 470]]

Slope: 0.50
Y-Intercept: 0.090

The formaldehyde concentration of the samples can be found by using the 
trend-line feature of the calculator or computer program used for the 
linear regression. For example, the TI-55 calculators use the ``X'' key 
(this gives the predicted formaldehyde concentration for the value of 
the absorbance you key in for the sample). Multiply the formaldehyde 
concentration from the sample by the dilution factor, if any, for the 
sample to give the formaldehyde concentration of the original, 
undiluted, sample (units will be micrograms/ml).
    11.1 Notes on the Pararosaniline Procedure
    11.1.1 The pararosaniline method is temperature-sensitive. However, 
the small fluctuations typical of a laboratory will not significantly 
affect the results.
    11.1.2 The calibration curve is linear to beyond 4 ``[micro]g/ml'' 
formaldehyde, however, a research-grade spectrophotometer is required to 
reproducibly read the high absorbance values. Consult your instrument 
manual to evaluate the capability of the spectrophotometer.
    11.1.3 The quality of the laboratory water used to prepare standards 
and make dilutions is critical. It is important that the cautions given 
in the Reagents section be observed. This procedure allows quantitation 
of formaldehyde at very low levels, and thus it is imperative to avoid 
contamination from other sources of formaldehyde and to exercise the 
degree of care required for trace analyses.
    11.1.4 The analyst should become familiar with the operation of the 
Oxford or equivalent pipettors before using them for an analysis. Follow 
the instructions of the manufacturer; one can pipet water into a tared 
container on any analytical balance to check pipet accuracy and 
precision. This will also establish if the proper technique is being 
used. Always use a new tip for each pipetting operation.
    11.1.5 This procedure follows the recommendations of ASTM Standard 
Guide D 3614, reading all solutions versus water in the reference cell. 
This allows the absorbance of the blank to be tracked on a daily basis. 
Refer to ASTM D 3614 for more information.

                            12.0 Calculations

    Carry out calculations, retaining at least one extra decimal figure 
beyond that of the acquired data. Round off figures after final 
calculations.
    12.1 Calculations of Total Formaldehyde
    12.1.1 To determine the total formaldehyde in mg, use the following 
equation if biocide was not used:
    Total mg formaldehyde=
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.043
    
Where:

C<INF>d</INF> = measured conc. formaldehyde, [micro]g/ml
V = total volume of stack sample, ml
DF = dilution factor

    12.1.2 To determine the total formaldehyde in mg, use the following 
equation if biocide was used:
    Total mg formaldehyde=
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.044
    
Where:

C<INF>d</INF> = measured conc. formaldehyde, [micro]g/ml
V = total volume of stack sample, ml
B = total volume of biocide added to sample, ml
DF = dilution factor

    12.2 Formaldehyde concentration (mg/m\3\) in stack gas. Determine 
the formaldehyde concentration (mg/m\3\) in the stack gas using the 
following equation: Formaldehyde concentration (mg/m\3\) =
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.045

Where:

K = 35.31 cu ft/m\3\ for V<INF>m</INF>(std) in English units, or
K = 1.00 m\3\/m\3\ for V<INF>m</INF>(std) in metric units
V<INF>m</INF>(std) = volume of gas sample measured by a dry gas meter, 
corrected to standard conditions, dscm (dscf)

    12.3 Average dry gas meter temperature and average orifice pressure 
drop are obtained from the data sheet.
    12.4 Dry Gas Volume: Calculate V<INF>m</INF>(std) and adjust for 
leakage, if necessary, using the equation in Section 6.3 of EPA Method 
5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    12.5 Volume of Water Vapor and Moisture Content: Calculated the 
volume of water vapor and moisture content from equations 5-2 and 5-3 of 
EPA Method 5.

                         13.0 Method Performance

    The precision of this method is estimated to be better than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent, expressed as <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq> the 
percent relative standard deviation.

Method 318--Extractive FTIR Method for the Measurement of Emissions From 
             the Mineral Wool and Wool Fiberglass Industries

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    This method has been validated and approved for mineral wool and 
wool fiberglass sources. This method may not be applied to other source 
categories without validation and approval by the Administrator 
according to the procedures in Test Method 301, 40 CFR part 63, appendix 
A. For sources seeking to apply FTIR to other source categories, Test 
Method 320 (40 CFR part 63, appendix A) may be utilized.
    1.1 Scope. The analytes measured by this method and their CAS 
numbers are:

Carbon Monoxide 630-08-0
Carbonyl Sulfide 463-58-1
Formaldehyde 50-00-0
Methanol 1455-13-6
Phenol 108-95-2
    1.2 Applicability

    1.2.1 This method is applicable for the determination of 
formaldehyde, phenol, methanol, carbonyl sulfide (COS) and carbon 
monoxide (CO) concentrations in controlled and uncontrolled emissions 
from manufacturing processes using phenolic resins. The compounds are 
analyzed in the mid-infrared spectral region (about 400 to 4000 cm-1 or 
25 to 2.5 [micro]m). Suggested analytical regions are given below (Table 
1). Slight deviations from these recommended regions may be necessary 
due to variations in moisture content and ammonia concentration from 
source to source.

                                       Table 1--Example Analytical Regions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
             Compound                Analytical region (cm-1)  FLm - FUm           Potential interferants
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Formaldehyde.....................  2840.93-2679.83.......................  Water, Methane.
Phenol...........................  1231.32-1131.47.......................  Water, Ammonia, Methane.
Methanol.........................  1041.56-1019.95.......................  Water, Ammonia.
COS \a\..........................  2028.4-2091.9.........................  Water, CO2 CO.
CO \a\...........................  2092.1-2191.8.........................  Water, CO2, COS.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\a\ Suggested analytical regions assume about 15 percent moisture and CO2, and that COS and CO have about the
  same absorbance (in the range of 10 to 50 ppm). If CO and COS are hundreds of ppm or higher, then CO2 and
  moisture interference is reduced. If CO or COS is present at high concentration and the other at low
  concentration, then a shorter cell pathlength may be necessary to measure the high concentration component.

1.2.2 This method does not apply when: (a) Polymerization of 
formaldehyde occurs, (b) moisture condenses in either the sampling 
system or the instrumentation, and (c) when moisture content of the gas 
stream is so high relative to the analyte concentrations that it causes 
severe spectral interference.
    1.3 Method Range and Sensitivity
    1.3.1 The analytical range is a function of instrumental design and 
composition of the gas stream. Theoretical detection limits depend, in 
part, on (a) the absorption coefficient of the compound in the 
analytical frequency region, (b) the spectral resolution, (c) 
interferometer sampling time, (d) detector sensitivity and response, and 
(e) absorption pathlength.
    1.3.2 Practically, there is no upper limit to the range. The 
practical lower detection limit is usually higher than the theoretical 
value, and depends on (a) moisture content of the flue gas, (b) presence 
of interferants, and (c) losses in the sampling system. In general, a 22 
meter pathlength cell in a suitable sampling system can achieve 
practical detection limits of 1.5 ppm for three compounds (formaldehyde, 
phenol, and methanol) at moisture levels up to 15 percent by volume. 
Sources with uncontrolled emissions of CO and COS may require a 4 meter 
pathlength cell due to high concentration levels. For these two 
compounds, make sure absorbance of highest concentration component is 
<1.0.
    1.4 Data Quality Objectives
1.4.1 In designing or configuring the system, the analyst first sets the 
data quality objectives, i.e., the desired lower detection limit 
(DL<INF>i</INF>) and the desired analytical uncertainty (AU<INF>i</INF>) 
for each compound. The instrumental parameters (factors b, c, d, and e 
in Section 1.3.1) are then chosen to meet these requirements, using 
Appendix D of the FTIR Protocol.
1.4.2 Data quality for each application is determined, in part, by 
measuring the RMS (Root Mean Square) noise level in each analytical 
spectral region (Appendix C of the FTIR Protocol). The RMS noise is 
defined as the RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) of the absorbance 
values in an analytical region from the mean absorbance value of the 
region. Appendix D of the FTIR Protocol defines the MAU<INF>im</INF> 
(minimum analyte uncertainty of the i\th\ analyte in the m\th\ 
analytical region). The MAU is the minimum analyte concentration for 
which the analytical uncertainty limit (AU<INF>i</INF>) can be 
maintained: if the measured analyte concentration is less than 
MAU<INF>i</INF>, then data quality is unacceptable. Table 2 gives some 
example DL and AU values along with calculated areas and MAU values 
using the protocol procedures.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 Principle
    2.1.1 Molecules are composed of chemically bonded atoms, which are 
in constant motion. The atomic motions result in bond deformations (bond 
stretching and bond-angle bending). The number of fundamental (or 
independent) vibrational motions depends on the number of atoms (N) in 
the molecule. At typical testing temperatures, most molecules are in the 
ground-state vibrational state for most of their fundamental vibrational 
motions. A molecule can undergo a transition from its ground state (for 
a particular vibration) to the first excited state by absorbing a 
quantum of light at a frequency characteristic of the molecule and the 
molecular motion. Molecules also undergo rotational transitions by 
absorbing energies in the far-infrared or microwave spectral regions. 
Rotational transition absorbencies are superimposed on the vibrational 
absorbencies to give a characteristic shape to each rotational-
vibrational absorbance ``band.''
    2.1.2 Most molecules exhibit more than one absorbance band in 
several frequency regions to produce an infrared spectrum (a 
characteristic pattern of bands or a ``fingerprint'') that is unique to 
each molecule. The infrared spectrum of a molecule depends on its 
structure (bond lengths, bond angles, bond strengths, and atomic 
masses). Even small differences in structure can produce significantly 
different spectra.
    2.1.3 Spectral band intensities vary with the concentration of the 
absorbing compound. Within constraints, the relationship between 
absorbance and sample concentration is linear. Sample spectra are 
compared to reference spectra to determine the species and their 
concentrations.
    2.2 Sampling and Analysis
    2.2.1 Flue gas is continuously extracted from the source, and the 
gas or a portion of the gas is conveyed to the FTIR gas cell, where a 
spectrum of the flue gas is recorded. Absorbance band intensities are 
related to sample concentrations by Beer's Law.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.046

Where:

A<INF>n</INF> = absorbance of the i\th\ component at the given 
frequency, [nu].
a = absorption coefficient of the i\th\ component at the frequency, 
[nu].
b = path length of the cell.
c = concentration of the i\th\ compound in the sample at frequency [nu].

    2.2.2 After identifying a compound from the infrared spectrum, its 
concentration is determined by comparing band intensities in the sample 
spectrum to band intensities in ``reference spectra'' of the 
formaldehyde, phenol, methanol, COS and CO. These reference spectra are 
available in a permanent soft copy from the EPA spectral library on the 
EMTIC bulletin board. The source may also prepare reference spectra 
according to Section 4.5 of the FTIR Protocol.

    Note: Reference spectra not prepared according to the FTIR Protocol 
are not acceptable for use in this test method. Documentation detailing 
the FTIR Protocol steps used in preparing any non-EPA reference spectra 
shall be included in each test report submitted by the source.

    2.3 Operator Requirements. The analyst must have some knowledge of 
source sampling and of infrared spectral patterns to operate the 
sampling system and to choose a suitable instrument configuration. The 
analyst should also understand FTIR instrument operation well enough to 
choose an instrument configuration consistent with the data quality 
objectives.

                             3.0 Definitions

    See Appendix A of the FTIR Protocol.

[[Page 473]]

                            4.0 Interferences

    4.1 Analytical (or Spectral) Interferences. Water vapor. High 
concentrations of ammonia (hundreds of ppm) may interfere with the 
analysis of low concentrations of methanol (1 to 5 ppm). For CO, carbon 
dioxide and water may be interferants. In cases where COS levels are low 
relative to CO levels, CO and water may be interferants.
    4.2 Sampling System Interferences. Water, if it condenses, and 
ammonia, which reacts with formaldehyde.

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 Formaldehyde is a suspected carcinogen; therefore, exposure to 
this compound must be limited. Proper monitoring and safety precautions 
must be practiced in any atmosphere with potentially high concentrations 
of CO.
    5.2 This method may involve sampling at locations having high 
positive or negative pressures, high temperatures, elevated heights, 
high concentrations of hazardous or toxic pollutants, or other diverse 
sampling conditions. It is the responsibility of the tester(s) to ensure 
proper safety and health practices, and to determine the applicability 
of regulatory limitations before performing this test method.

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

    The equipment and supplies are based on the schematic of a sampling 
train shown in Figure 1. Either the evacuated or purged sampling 
technique may be used with this sampling train. Alternatives may be 
used, provided that the data quality objectives of this method are met.
    6.1 Sampling Probe. Glass, stainless steel, or other appropriate 
material of sufficient length and physical integrity to sustain heating, 
prevent adsorption of analytes, and to reach gas sampling point.
    6.2 Particulate Filters. A glass wool plug (optional) inserted at 
the probe tip (for large particulate removal) and a filter rated at 1-
micron (e.g., Balston \TM\) for fine particulate removal, placed 
immediately after the heated probe.
    6.3 Sampling Line/Heating System. Heated (maintained at 250 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>25 degrees F) stainless steel, Teflon \TM\, or other 
inert material that does not adsorb the analytes, to transport the 
sample to analytical system.
    6.4 Stainless Steel Tubing. Type 316, e.g., \3/8\ in. diameter, and 
appropriate length for heated connections.
    6.5 Gas Regulators. Appropriate for individual gas cylinders.

[[Page 474]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.052

    6.6 Teflon \TM\ Tubing. Diameter (e.g., \3/8\ in.) and length 
suitable to connect cylinder regulators.
    6.7 Sample Pump. A leak-free pump (e.g., KNF \TM\), with by-pass 
valve, capable of pulling sample through entire sampling system at a 
rate of about 10 to 20 L/min. If placed before the analytical system, 
heat the pump and use a pump fabricated from materials non-reactive to 
the target pollutants. If the pump is located after the instrument, 
systematically record the sample pressure in the gas cell.
    6.8 Gas Sample Manifold. A heated manifold that diverts part of the 
sample stream to the analyzer, and the rest to the by-pass discharge 
vent or other analytical instrumentation.
    6.9 Rotameter. A calibrated 0 to 20 L/min range rotameter.
    6.10 FTIR Analytical System. Spectrometer and detector, capable of 
measuring formaldehyde, phenol, methanol, COS and CO to the 
predetermined minimum detectable level. The system shall include a 
personal computer with compatible software that provides real-time 
updates of the spectral profile during sample collection and spectral 
collection.
    6.11 FTIR Cell Pump. Required for the evacuated sampling technique, 
capable of evacuating the FTIR cell volume within 2 minutes. The FTIR 
cell pump should allow the operator to obtain at least 8 sample spectra 
in 1 hour.
    6.12 Absolute Pressure Gauge. Heatable and capable of measuring 
pressure from 0 to 1000 mmHg to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.5 mmHg 
(e.g., Baratron \TM\).
    6.13 Temperature Gauge. Capable of measuring the cell temperature to 
within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 [deg]C.

[[Page 475]]

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards

    7.1 Ethylene (Calibration Transfer Standard). Obtain NIST traceable 
(or Protocol) cylinder gas.
    7.2 Nitrogen. Ultra high purity (UHP) grade.
    7.3 Reference Spectra. Obtain reference spectra for the target 
pollutants at concentrations that bracket (in ppm-meter/K) the emission 
source levels. Also, obtain reference spectra for SF<INF>6</INF> and 
ethylene. Suitable concentrations are 0.0112 to 0.112 (ppm-meter)/K for 
SF<INF>6</INF> and 5.61 (ppm-meter)/K or less for ethylene. The 
reference spectra shall meet the criteria for acceptance outlined in 
Section 2.2.2. The optical density (ppm-meters/K) of the reference 
spectrum must match the optical density of the sample spectrum within 
(less than) 25 percent.

            8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, and Storage

    Sampling should be performed in the following sequence: Collect 
background, collect CTS spectrum, collect samples, collect post-test CTS 
spectrum, verify that two copies of all data were stored on separate 
computer media.
    8.1 Pretest Preparations and Evaluations. Using the procedure in 
Section 4.0 of the FTIR Protocol, determine the optimum sampling system 
configuration for sampling the target pollutants. Table 2 gives some 
example values for AU, DL, and MAU. Based on a study (Reference 1), an 
FTIR system using 1 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> resolution, 22 meter path length, 
and a broad band MCT detector was suitable for meeting the requirements 
in Table 2. Other factors that must be determined are:
    a. Test requirements: AU<INF>i</INF>, CMAX<INF>i</INF>, 
DL<INF>i</INF>, OFU<INF>i</INF>, and t<INF>AN</INF> for each.
    b. Interferants: See Table 1.
    c. Sampling system: L<INF>S</INF>', P<INF>min</INF>, P<INF>S</INF>', 
T<INF>S</INF>', t<INF>SS</INF>, V<INF>SS</INF>; fractional error, MIL.
    d. Analytical regions: 1 through N<INF>m</INF>, FL<INF>m</INF>, 
FC<INF>m</INF>, and FU<INF>m</INF>, plus interferants, FFU<INF>m</INF>, 
FFL<INF>m</INF>, wavenumber range FNU to FNL. See Tables 1 and 2.
    8.1.1 If necessary, sample and acquire an initial spectrum. Then 
determine the proper operational pathlength of the instrument to obtain 
non-saturated absorbances of the target analytes.
    8.1.2 Set up the sampling train as shown in Figure 1.
    8.2 Sampling System Leak-check. Leak-check from the probe tip to 
pump outlet as follows: Connect a 0- to 250-mL/min rate meter (rotameter 
or bubble meter) to the outlet of the pump. Close off the inlet to the 
probe, and note the leakage rate. The leakage rate shall be <=200 mL/
min.
    8.3 Analytical System Leak-check.
    8.3.1 For the evacuated sample technique, close the valve to the 
FTIR cell, and evacuate the absorption cell to the minimum absolute 
pressure P<INF>min</INF>. Close the valve to the pump, and determine the 
change in pressure [Delta]P<INF>v</INF> after 2 minutes.
    8.3.2 For both the evacuated sample and purging techniques, 
pressurize the system to about 100 mmHg above atmospheric pressure. 
Isolate the pump and determine the change in pressure 
[Delta]P<INF>p</INF> after 2 minutes.
    8.3.3 Measure the barometric pressure, P<INF>b</INF> in mmHg.
    8.3.4 Determine the percent leak volume %V<INF>L</INF> for the 
signal integration time t<INF>SS</INF> and for [Delta]P<INF>max</INF>, 
i.e., the larger of [Delta]P<INF>v</INF> or [Delta]P<INF>p</INF>, as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.047

Where:

50 = 100% divided by the leak-check time of 2 minutes.

    8.3.5 Leak volumes in excess of 4 percent of the sample system 
volume V<INF>SS</INF> are unacceptable.
    8.4 Background Spectrum. Evacuate the gas cell to <=5 mmHg, and fill 
with dry nitrogen gas to ambient pressure. Verify that no significant 
amounts of absorbing species (for example water vapor and 
CO<INF>2</INF>) are present. Collect a background spectrum, using a 
signal averaging period equal to or greater than the averaging period 
for the sample spectra. Assign a unique file name to the background 
spectrum. Store the spectra of the background interferogram and 
processed single-beam background spectrum on two separate computer media 
(one is used as the back-up). If continuous sampling will be used during 
sample collection, collect the background spectrum with nitrogen gas 
flowing through the cell at the same pressure and temperature as will be 
used during sampling.
    8.5 Pre-Test Calibration Transfer Standard. Evacuate the gas cell to 
<=5 mmHg absolute pressure, and fill the FTIR cell to atmospheric 
pressure with the CTS gas. Or, purge the cell with 10 cell volumes of 
CTS gas. Record the spectrum. If continuous sampling will be used during 
sample collection, collect the CTS spectrum with CTS gas flowing through 
the cell at the same pressure and temperature as will be used during 
sampling.
    8.6 Samples
    8.6.1 Evacuated Samples. Evacuate the absorbance cell to <=5 mmHg 
absolute pressure. Fill the cell with flue gas to ambient pressure and 
record the spectrum. Before taking the next sample, evacuate the cell 
until no further evidence of absorption exists. Repeat this procedure to 
collect at least 8 separate spectra (samples) in 1 hour.
    8.6.2 Purge Sampling. Purge the FTIR cell with 10 cell volumes of 
flue gas and at least for about 10 minutes. Discontinue the gas cell 
purge, isolate the cell, and record the

[[Page 476]]

sample spectrum and the pressure. Before taking the next sample, purge 
the cell with 10 cell volumes of flue gas.
    8.6.3 Continuous Sampling. Spectra can be collected continuously 
while the FTIR cell is being purged. The sample integration time, 
t<INF>ss</INF>, the sample flow rate through the FTIR gas cell, and the 
total run time must be chosen so that the collected data consist of at 
least 10 spectra with each spectrum being of a separate cell volume of 
flue gas. More spectra can be collected over the run time and the total 
run time (and number of spectra) can be extended as well.
    8.7 Sampling QA, Data Storage and Reporting
    8.7.1 Sample integration times should be sufficient to achieve the 
required signal-to-noise ratios. Obtain an absorbance spectrum by 
filling the cell with nitrogen. Measure the RMSD in each analytical 
region in this absorbance spectrum. Verify that the number of scans is 
sufficient to achieve the target MAU (Table 2).
    8.7.2 Identify all sample spectra with unique file names.
    8.7.3 Store on two separate computer media a copy of sample 
interferograms and processed spectra. The data shall be available to the 
Administrator on request for the length of time specified in the 
applicable regulation.
    8.7.4 For each sample spectrum, document the sampling conditions, 
the sampling time (while the cell was being filled), the time the 
spectrum was recorded, the instrumental conditions (path length, 
temperature, pressure, resolution, integration time), and the spectral 
file name. Keep a hard copy of these data sheets.
    8.8 Signal Transmittance. While sampling, monitor the signal 
transmittance through the instrumental system. If signal transmittance 
(relative to the background) drops below 95 percent in any spectral 
region where the sample does not absorb infrared energy, obtain a new 
background spectrum.
    8.9 Post-run CTS. After each sampling run, record another CTS 
spectrum.
    8.10 Post-test QA
    8.10.1 Inspect the sample spectra immediately after the run to 
verify that the gas matrix composition was close to the expected 
(assumed) gas matrix.
    8.10.2 Verify that the sampling and instrumental parameters were 
appropriate for the conditions encountered. For example, if the moisture 
is much greater than anticipated, it will be necessary to use a shorter 
path length or dilute the sample.
    8.10.3 Compare the pre and post-run CTS spectra. They shall agree to 
within -5 percent. See FTIR Protocol, Appendix E.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    Follow the quality assurance procedures in the method, including the 
analysis of pre and post-run calibration transfer standards (Sections 
8.5 and 8.9) and the post-test quality assurance procedures in Section 
8.10.

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    10.1 Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N). The S/N shall be sufficient to 
meet the MAU in each analytical region.
    10.2 Absorbance Pathlength. Verify the absorbance path length by 
comparing CTS spectra to reference spectra of the calibration gas(es). 
See FTIR Protocol, Appendix E.
    10.3 Instrument Resolution. Measure the line width of appropriate 
CTS band(s) and compare to reference CTS spectra to verify instrumental 
resolution.
    10.4 Apodization Function. Choose appropriate apodization function. 
Determine any appropriate mathematical transformations that are required 
to correct instrumental errors by measuring the CTS. Any mathematical 
transformations must be documented and reproducible.
    10.5 FTIR Cell Volume. Evacuate the cell to <=5 mmHg. Measure the 
initial absolute temperature (T<INF>i</INF>) and absolute pressure 
(P<INF>i</INF>). Connect a wet test meter (or a calibrated dry gas 
meter), and slowly draw room air into the cell. Measure the meter volume 
(V<INF>m</INF>), meter absolute temperature (T<INF>m</INF>), and meter 
absolute pressure (P<INF>m</INF>), and the cell final absolute 
temperature (T<INF>f</INF>) and absolute pressure (P<INF>f</INF>). 
Calculate the FTIR cell volume V<INF>ss</INF>, including that of the 
connecting tubing, as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.048

As an alternative to the wet test meter/calibrated dry gas meter 
procedure, measure the inside dimensions of the cell cylinder and 
calculate its volume.

                             11.0 Procedure

    Refer to Sections 4.6-4.11, Sections 5, 6, and 7, and the appendices 
of the FTIR Protocol.

                   12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

    a. Data analysis is performed using appropriate reference spectra 
whose concentrations can be verified using CTS spectra. Various 
analytical programs are available to relate sample absorbance to a 
concentration standard. Calculated concentrations should be verified by 
analyzing spectral baselines after mathematically subtracting scaled 
reference spectra from the sample spectra. A full description of the 
data analysis and calculations may be found in the FTIR Protocol 
(Sections 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 and appendices).

[[Page 477]]

    b. Correct the calculated concentrations in sample spectra for 
differences in absorption pathlength between the reference and sample 
spectra by:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.049

Where:

C<INF>corr</INF> = The pathlength corrected concentration.
C<INF>calc</INF> = The initial calculated concentration (output of the 
Multicomp program designed for the compound).
L<INF>r</INF> = The pathlength associated with the reference spectra.
L<INF>s</INF> = The pathlength associated with the sample spectra.
T<INF>s</INF> = The absolute temperature (K) of the sample gas.
T<INF>r</INF> = The absolute gas temperature (K) at which reference 
spectra were recorded.

                    13.0 Reporting and Recordkeeping

    All interferograms used in determining source concentration shall be 
stored for the period of time required in the applicable regulation. The 
Administrator has the option of requesting the interferograms recorded 
during the test in electronic form as part of the test report.

                         14.0 Method Performance

    Refer to the FTIR Protocol.

 Method 319--Determination of Filtration Efficiency for Paint Overspray 
                                Arrestors

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 This method applies to the determination of the initial, 
particle size dependent, filtration efficiency for paint arrestors over 
the particle diameter range from 0.3 to 10 [micro]m. The method applies 
to single and multiple stage paint arrestors or paint arrestor media. 
The method is applicable to efficiency determinations from 0 to 99 
percent. Two test aerosols are used--one liquid phase and one solid 
phase. Oleic acid, a low-volatility liquid (CAS Number 112-80-1), is 
used to simulate the behavior of wet paint overspray. The solid-phase 
aerosol is potassium chloride salt (KCl, CAS Number 7447-40-7) and is 
used to simulate the behavior of a dry overspray. The method is limited 
to determination of the initial, clean filtration efficiency of the 
arrestor. Changes in efficiency (either increase or decrease) due to the 
accumulation of paint overspray on and within the arrestor are not 
evaluated.
    1.2 Efficiency is defined as 1--Penetration (e.g., 70 percent 
efficiency is equal to 0.30 penetration). Penetration is based on the 
ratio of the downstream particle concentration to the upstream 
concentration. It is often more useful, from a mathematical or 
statistical point of view, to discuss the upstream and downstream counts 
in terms of penetration rather than the derived efficiency value. Thus, 
this document uses both penetration and efficiency as appropriate.
    1.3 For a paint arrestor system or subsystem which has been tested 
by this method, adding additional filtration devices to the system or 
subsystem shall be assumed to result in an efficiency of at least that 
of the original system without the requirement for additional testing. 
(For example, if the final stage of a three-stage paint arrestor system 
has been tested by itself, then the addition of the other two stages 
shall be assumed to maintain, as a minimum, the filtration efficiency 
provided by the final stage alone. Thus, in this example, if the final 
stage has been shown to meet the filtration requirements of Table 1 of 
Sec. 63.745 of subpart GG, then the final stage in combination with any 
additional paint arrestor stages also passes the filtration 
requirements.)

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 This method applies to the determination of the fractional 
(i.e., particle-size dependent) aerosol penetration of several types of 
paint arrestors. Fractional penetration is computed from aerosol 
concentrations measured upstream and downstream of an arrestor installed 
in a laboratory test rig. The aerosol concentrations upstream and 
downstream of the arrestors are measured with an aerosol analyzer that 
simultaneously counts and sizes the particles in the aerosol stream. The 
aerosol analyzer covers the particle diameter size range from 0.3 to 10 
[micro]m in a minimum of 12 contiguous sizing channels. Each sizing 
channel covers a narrow range of particle diameters. For example, 
Channel 1 may cover from 0.3 to 0.4 [micro]m, Channel 2 from 0.4 to 0.5 
[micro]m, * * * By taking the ratio of the

[[Page 478]]

downstream to upstream counts on a channel by channel basis, the 
penetration is computed for each of the sizing channels.
    2.2 The upstream and downstream aerosol measurements are made while 
injecting the test aerosol into the air stream upstream of the arrestor 
(ambient aerosol is removed with HEPA filters on the inlet of the test 
rig). This test aerosol spans the particle size range from 0.3 to 10 
[micro]m and provides sufficient upstream concentration in each of the 
optical particle counter (OPC) sizing channels to allow accurate 
calculation of penetration, down to penetrations of approximately 0.01 
(i.e., 1 percent penetration; 99 percent efficiency). Results are 
presented as a graph and a data table showing the aerodynamic particle 
diameter and the corresponding fractional efficiency.

                             3.0 Definitions

    Aerodynamic Diameter--diameter of a unit density sphere having the 
same aerodynamic properties as the particle in question.
    Efficiency is defined as equal to 1--Penetration.
    Optical Particle Counter (OPC)--an instrument that counts particles 
by size using light scattering. An OPC gives particle diameters based on 
size, index of refraction, and shape.
    Penetration--the fraction of the aerosol that penetrates the filter 
at a given particle diameter. Penetration equals the downstream 
concentration divided by the upstream concentration.

                            4.0 Interferences

    4.1 The influence of the known interferences (particle losses) are 
negated by correction of the data using blanks.

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 There are no specific safety precautions for this method above 
those of good laboratory practice. This standard does not purport to 
address all of the safety problems, if any, associated with its use. It 
is the responsibility of the user of this method to establish 
appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability 
of regulatory limitations prior to use.

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

    6.1 Test Facility. A schematic diagram of a test duct used in the 
development of the method is shown in Figure 319-1.

[[Page 479]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MR98.008

    6.1.1 The test section, paint spray section, and attached 
transitions are constructed of stainless and galvanized steel. The 
upstream and downstream ducting is 20 cm diameter polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC). The upstream transition provides a 7 [deg] angle of expansion to 
provide a uniform air flow distribution to the paint arrestors. Aerosol 
concentration is

[[Page 480]]

measured upstream and downstream of the test section to obtain the 
challenge and penetrating aerosol concentrations, respectively. Because 
the downstream ducting runs back under the test section, the challenge 
and penetrating aerosol taps are located physically near each other, 
thereby facilitating aerosol sampling and reducing sample-line length. 
The inlet nozzles of the upstream and downstream aerosol probes are 
designed to yield isokinetic sampling conditions.
    6.1.2 The configuration and dimensions of the test duct can deviate 
from those of Figure 319-1 provided that the following key elements are 
maintained: the test duct must meet the criteria specified in Table 319-
1; the inlet air is HEPA filtered; the blower is on the upstream side of 
the duct thereby creating a positive pressure in the duct relative to 
the surrounding room; the challenge air has a temperature between 50 
[deg] and 100 [deg]F and a relative humidity of less than 65 percent; 
the angle of the upstream transition (if used) to the paint arrestor 
must not exceed 7 [deg]; the angle of the downstream transition (if 
used) from the paint arrestor must not exceed 30 [deg]; the test duct 
must provide a means for mixing the challenge aerosol with the upstream 
flow (in lieu of any mixing device, a duct length of 15 duct diameters 
fulfills this requirement); the test duct must provide a means for 
mixing any penetrating aerosol with the downstream flow (in lieu of any 
mixing device, a duct length of 15 duct diameters fulfills this 
requirement); the test section must provide a secure and leak-free 
mounting for single and multiple stage arrestors; and the test duct may 
utilize a 180 [deg] bend in the downstream duct.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.2 Aerosol Generator. The aerosol generator is used to produce a 
stable aerosol covering the particle size range from 0.3 to 10 [micro]m 
diameter. The generator used in the development of this method consists 
of an air atomizing nozzle positioned at the top of a 0.30-m (12-in.) 
diameter, 1.3-m (51-in.) tall, acrylic, transparent, spray tower. This 
tower allows larger sized particles, which would otherwise foul the test 
duct and sample lines, to fall out of the aerosol. It also adds drying 
air to ensure that the KCl droplets dry to solid salt particles. After 
generation, the aerosol passes through an aerosol neutralizer (Kr85 
radioactive source) to neutralize any electrostatic charge on the 
aerosol (electrostatic charge is an unavoidable consequence of most 
aerosol generation methods). To improve the mixing of the aerosol with 
the air stream, the aerosol is injected counter to the airflow. 
Generators of other designs may be used, but they must produce a stable 
aerosol concentration over the 0.3 to 10 [micro]m diameter size range; 
provide a means of ensuring the complete drying of the KCl aerosol; and 
utilize a charge neutralizer to neutralize any electrostatic charge on 
the aerosol. The resultant challenge aerosol must meet the minimum count 
per channel and maximum concentration criteria of Table 319-1.
    6.3 Installation of Paint Arrestor. The paint arrestor is to be 
installed in the test duct in a manner that precludes air bypassing the 
arrestor. Since arrestor media are often sold unmounted, a mounting 
frame may be used to provide back support for the media in addition to 
sealing it into the duct. The mounting frame for 20 in.x20 in. arrestors 
will have minimum open internal dimensions of 18 in. square. Mounting 
frames for 24 in.x24 in. arrestors will have minimum open internal 
dimensions of 22 in. square. The open internal dimensions of the 
mounting frame shall not be less than 75 percent of the approach duct 
dimensions.

[[Page 481]]

    6.4 Optical Particle Counter. The upstream and downstream aerosol 
concentrations are measured with a high-resolution optical particle 
counter (OPC). To ensure comparability of test results, the OPC shall 
utilize an optical design based on wide-angle light scattering and 
provided a minimum of 12 contiguous particle sizing channels from 0.3 to 
10 [micro]m diameter (based on response to PSL) where, for each channel, 
the ratio of the diameter corresponding to the upper channel bound to 
the lower channel bound must not exceed 1.5.
    6.5 Aerosol Sampling System. The upstream and downstream sample 
lines must be made of rigid electrically-grounded metallic tubing having 
a smooth inside surface, and they must be rigidly secured to prevent 
movement during testing. The upstream and downstream sample lines are to 
be nominally identical in geometry. The use of a short length (100 mm 
maximum) of straight flexible tubing to make the final connection to the 
OPC is acceptable. The inlet nozzles of the upstream and downstream 
probes must be sharp-edged and of appropriate entrance diameter to 
maintain isokinetic sampling within 20 percent of the air velocity.
    6.5.1 The sampling system may be designed to acquire the upstream 
and downstream samples using (a) sequential upstream-downstream sampling 
with a single OPC, (b) simultaneous upstream and downstream sampling 
with two OPC's, or (c) sequential upstream-downstream sampling with two 
OPC's.
    6.5.2 When two particle counters are used to acquire the upstream 
and downstream counts, they must be closely matched in flowrate and 
optical design.
    6.6 Airflow Monitor. The volumetric airflow through the system shall 
be measured with a calibrated orifice plate, flow nozzle, or laminar 
flow element. The measurement device must have an accuracy of 5 percent 
or better.

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards

    7.1 The liquid test aerosol is reagent grade, 98 percent pure, oleic 
acid (Table 319-2). The solid test aerosol is KCl aerosolized from a 
solution of KCl in water. In addition to the test aerosol, a calibration 
aerosol of monodisperse polystyrene latex (PSL) spheres is used to 
verify the calibration of the OPC.

            8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, and Storage

    8.1 In this test, all sampling occurs in real-time, thus no samples 
are collected that require preservation or storage during the test. The 
paint arrestors are shipped and stored to avoid structural damage or 
soiling. Each arrestor may be shipped in its original box from the 
manufacturer or similar cardboard box. Arrestors are stored at the test 
site in a location that keeps them clean and dry. Each arrestor is 
clearly labeled for tracking purposes.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    9.1 Table 319-1 lists the QC control limits.
    9.2 The standard deviation ([sigma]) of the penetration (P) for a 
given test at each of the 15 OPC sizing channels is computed from the 
coefficient of variation (CV, the standard deviation divided by the 
mean) of the upstream and downstream measurements as:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MR98.009

For a properly operating system, the standard deviation of the 
penetration is < 0.10 at particle diameters from 0.3 to 3 [micro]m and 
less than 0.30 at diameters <ls-thn-eq> 3 [micro]m.
    9.3 Data Quality Objectives (DQO).
    9.3.1 Fractional Penetration. From the triplicate tests of each 
paint arrestor model, the standard deviation for the penetration 
measurements at each particle size (i.e., for each sizing channel of the 
OPC) is computed as:

[[Page 482]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MR98.010

where P<INF>i</INF> represents an individual penetration measurement, 
and P the average of the 3 (n = 3) individual measurements.

    9.3.2 Bias of the fractional penetration values is determined from 
triplicate no-filter and HEPA filter tests. These tests determine the 
measurement bias at 100 percent penetration and 0 percent penetration, 
respectively.
    9.3.3 PSL-Equivalent Light Scattering Diameter. The precision and 
bias of the OPC sizing determination are based on sampling a known 
diameter of PSL and noting whether the particle counts peak in the 
correct channel of the OPC. This is a pass/fail measurement with no 
calculations involved.
    9.3.4 Airflow. The precision of the measurement must be within 5 
percent of the set point.

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    10.1 Optical Particle Counter. The OPC must have an up-to-date 
factory calibration. Check the OPC zero at the beginning and end of each 
test by sampling HEPA-filtered air. Verify the sizing accuracy on a 
daily basis (for days when tests are performed) with 1-size PSL spheres.
    10.2 Airflow Measurement. Airflow measurement devices must have an 
accuracy of 5 percent or better. Manometers used in conjunction with the 
orifice plate must be inspected prior to use for proper level, zero, and 
mechanical integrity. Tubing connections to the manometer must be free 
from kinks and have secure connections.
    10.3 Pressure Drop. Measure pressure drop across the paint arrestor 
with an inclined manometer readable to within 0.01 in. H<INF>2</INF>O. 
Prior to use, the level and zero of the manometer, and all tubing 
connections, must be inspected and adjusted as needed.

                             11.0 Procedure

    11.1 Filtration Efficiency. For both the oleic acid and KCl 
challenges, this procedure is performed in triplicate using a new 
arrestor for each test.

    11.1.1.6 Visually confirm the manometer zero and level. Adjust as 
needed.
    11.1.2 Clean Efficiency Test.
    11.1.2.1 Record the date and time upon beginning this section.
    11.1.2.2 Optical Particle Counter.
    11.1.2.2.1 General: Operate the OPC per the manufacturer's 
instructions allowing a minimum of 20 minutes warm up before making any 
measurements.
    11.1.2.2.2 Overload: The OPC will yield inaccurate data if the 
aerosol concentration it is attempting to measure exceeds its operating 
limit. To ensure reliable measurements, the maximum aerosol 
concentration will not exceed 10 percent of the manufacturer's claimed 
upper concentration limit corresponding to a 10 percent count error. If 
this value is exceeded, reduce the aerosol concentration until the 
acceptable conditions are met.
    11.1.2.2.3 Zero Count: Connect a HEPA capsule to the inlet of the 
OPC and obtain printouts for three samples (each a minimum of 1-minute 
each). Record maximum cumulative zero count. If the count rate exceeds 
50 counts per minute, the OPC requires servicing before continuing.
    11.1.2.2.4 PSL Check of OPC Calibration: Confirm the calibration of 
the OPC by sampling a known size PSL aerosol. Aerosolize the PSL using 
an appropriate nebulizer. Record whether the peak count is observed in 
the proper channel. If the peak is not seen in the appropriate channel, 
have the OPC recalibrated.
    11.1.2.3 Test Conditions:
    11.1.2.3.1 Airflow: The test airflow corresponds to a nominal face 
velocity of 120 FPM through the arrestor. For arrestors having nominal 
20 in.x20 in. face dimensions, this measurement corresponds to an 
airflow of 333 cfm. For arrestors having nominal face dimensions of 24 
in.x24 in., this measurement corresponds to an airflow of 480 cfm.
    11.1.2.3.2 Temperature and Relative Humidity: The temperature and 
relative humidity of the challenge air stream will be measured to within 
an accuracy of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 [deg]F and <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>10 percent RH. To protect the probe from fouling, it may 
be removed during periods of aerosol generation.
    11.1.2.3.3 Barometric Pressure: Use a mercury barometer. Record the 
atmospheric pressure.
    11.1.2.4 Upstream and Downstream Background Counts.
    11.1.2.4.1 With the arrestor installed in the test duct and the 
airflow set at the proper value, turn on the data acquisition computer 
and bring up the data acquisition program.
    11.1.2.4.2 Set the OPC settings for the appropriate test sample 
duration with output for both printer and computer data collection.
    11.1.2.4.3 Obtain one set of upstream-downstream background 
measurements.
    11.1.2.4.4 After obtaining the upstream-downstream measurements, 
stop data acquisition.
    11.1.2.5 Efficiency Measurements:
    11.1.2.5.1 Record the arrestor pressure drop.
    11.1.2.5.2 Turn on the Aerosol Generator. Begin aerosol generation 
and record the operating parameters.
    11.1.2.5.3 Monitor the particle counts. Allow a minimum of 5 minutes 
for the generator to stabilize.
    11.1.2.5.4 Confirm that the total particle count does not exceed the 
predetermined upper limit. Adjust generator as needed.
    11.1.2.5.5 Confirm that a minimum of 50 particle counts are measured 
in the upstream sample in each of the OPC channels per sample. (A 
minimum of 50 counts per channel per sample will yield the required 
minimum 500 counts per channel total for the 10 upstream samples as 
specified in Table 319-1.) Adjust generator or sample time as needed.
    11.1.2.5.6 If you are unable to obtain a stable concentration within 
the concentration limit and with the 50 count minimum per channel, 
adjust the aerosol generator.
    11.1.2.5.7 When the counts are stable, perform repeated upstream-
downstream sampling until 10 upstream-downstream measurements are 
obtained.
    11.1.2.5.8 After collection of the 10 upstream-downstream samples, 
stop data acquisition and allow 2 more minutes for final purging of 
generator.
    11.1.2.5.9 Obtain one additional set of upstream-downstream 
background samples.
    11.1.2.5.10 After obtaining the upstream-downstream background 
samples, stop data acquisition.
    11.1.2.5.11 Record the arrestor pressure drop.
    11.1.2.5.12 Turn off blower.
    11.1.2.5.13 Remove the paint arrestor assembly from the test duct. 
Note any signs of physical deterioration.
    11.1.2.5.14 Remove the arrestor from the frame and place the 
arrestor in an appropriate storage bag.
    11.2 Control Test: 100 Percent Penetration Test. A 100 percent 
penetration test must be performed immediately before each individual 
paint arrestor test using the same challenge aerosol substance (i.e., 
oleic acid or KCl) as to be used in the arrestor test. These tests are 
performed with no arrestor installed in the test housing. This test is a 
relatively stringent test of the adequacy of the overall duct, sampling, 
measurement, and aerosol generation system. The test is performed as a 
normal penetration test except the paint arrestor is not used. A perfect 
system would yield a measured penetration of 1 at all particle sizes. 
Deviations from 1

[[Page 484]]

can occur due to particle losses in the duct, differences in the degree 
of aerosol uniformity (i.e., mixing) at the upstream and downstream 
probes, and differences in particle transport efficiency in the upstream 
and downstream sampling lines.
    11.3 Control Test: 0 Percent Penetration. One 0 percent penetration 
test must be performed at least monthly during testing. The test is 
performed by using a HEPA filter rather than a paint arrestor. This test 
assesses the adequacy of the instrument response time and sample line 
lag.

                   12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

    12.1 Analysis. The analytical procedures for the fractional 
penetration and flow velocity measurements are described in Section 11. 
Note that the primary measurements, those of the upstream and downstream 
aerosol concentrations, are performed with the OPC which acquires the 
sample and analyzes it in real time. Because all the test data are 
collected in real time, there are no analytical procedures performed 
subsequent to the actual test, only data analysis.

   Test Method 320--Measurement of Vapor Phase Organic and Inorganic 
 Emissions by Extractive Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy

                            1.0 Introduction

    Persons unfamiliar with basic elements of FTIR spectroscopy should 
not attempt to use this method. This method describes sampling and 
analytical procedures for extractive emission measurements using Fourier 
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Detailed analytical procedures 
for interpreting infrared spectra are described in the ``Protocol for 
the Use of Extractive Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometry in 
Analyses of Gaseous Emissions from Stationary Sources,'' hereafter 
referred to as the ``Protocol.'' Definitions not given in this method 
are given in appendix A of the Protocol. References to specific sections 
in the Protocol are made throughout this Method. For additional 
information refer to references 1 and 2, and other EPA reports, which 
describe the use of FTIR spectrometry in specific field measurement 
applications and validation tests. The sampling procedure described here 
is extractive. Flue gas is extracted through a heated gas transport and 
handling system. For some sources, sample conditioning systems may be 
applicable. Some examples are given in this method.

    Note: sample conditioning systems may be used providing the method 
validation requirements in Sections 9.2 and 13.0 of this method are met.
    1.1 Scope and Applicability.
    1.1.1 Analytes. Analytes include hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) for 
which EPA reference spectra have been developed. Other compounds can 
also be measured with this method if reference spectra are prepared 
according to section 4.6 of the protocol.
    1.1.2 Applicability. This method applies to the analysis of vapor 
phase organic or inorganic compounds which absorb energy in the mid-
infrared spectral region, about 400 to 4000 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> (25 to 2.5 
[micro]m). This method is used to determine compound-specific 
concentrations in a multi-component vapor phase sample, which is 
contained in a closed-path gas cell. Spectra of samples are collected 
using double beam infrared absorption spectroscopy. A computer program 
is used to analyze spectra and report compound concentrations.
    1.2 Method Range and Sensitivity. Analytical range and sensitivity 
depend on the frequency-dependent analyte absorptivity, instrument 
configuration, data collection parameters, and gas stream composition. 
Instrument factors include: (a) spectral resolution, (b) interferometer 
signal averaging time, (c) detector sensitivity and response, and (d) 
absorption path length.
    1.2.1 For any optical configuration the analytical range is between 
the absorbance values of about .01 (infrared transmittance relative to 
the background = 0.98) and 1.0
(T = 0.1). (For absorbance <ls-thn-eq> 1.0 the relation between 
absorbance and concentration may not be linear.)
    1.2.2 The concentrations associated with this absorbance range 
depend primarily on the cell path length and the sample temperature. An 
analyte absorbance greater than 1.0, can be lowered by decreasing the 
optical path length. Analyte absorbance increases with a longer path 
length. Analyte detection also depends on the presence of other species 
exhibiting absorbance in the same analytical region. Additionally, the 
estimated lower absorbance (A) limit

[[Page 486]]

(A = 0.01) depends on the root mean square deviation (RMSD) noise in the 
analytical region.
    1.2.3 The concentration range of this method is determined by the 
choice of optical configuration.
    1.2.3.1 The absorbance for a given concentration can be decreased by 
decreasing the path length or by diluting the sample. There is no 
practical upper limit to the measurement range.
    1.2.3.2 The analyte absorbance for a given concentration may be 
increased by increasing the cell path length or (to some extent) using a 
higher resolution. Both modifications also cause a corresponding 
increased absorbance for all compounds in the sample, and a decrease in 
the signal throughput. For this reason the practical lower detection 
range (quantitation limit) usually depends on sample characteristics 
such as moisture content of the gas, the presence of other interferants, 
and losses in the sampling system.
    1.3 Sensitivity. The limit of sensitivity for an optical 
configuration and integration time is determined using appendix D of the 
Protocol: Minimum Analyte Uncertainty, (MAU). The MAU depends on the 
RMSD noise in an analytical region, and on the absorptivity of the 
analyte in the same region.
    1.4 Data Quality. Data quality shall be determined by executing 
Protocol pre-test procedures in appendices B to H of the protocol and 
post-test procedures in appendices I and J of the protocol.
    1.4.1 Measurement objectives shall be established by the choice of 
detection limit (DL<INF>i</INF>) and analytical uncertainty 
(AU<INF>i</INF>) for each analyte.
    1.4.2 An instrumental configuration shall be selected. An estimate 
of gas composition shall be made based on previous test data, data from 
a similar source or information gathered in a pre-test site survey. 
Spectral interferants shall be identified using the selected 
DL<INF>i</INF> and AU<INF>i</INF> and band areas from reference spectra 
and interferant spectra. The baseline noise of the system shall be 
measured in each analytical region to determine the MAU of the 
instrument configuration for each analyte and interferant 
(MIU<INF>i</INF>).
    1.4.3 Data quality for the application shall be determined, in part, 
by measuring the RMS (root mean square) noise level in each analytical 
spectral region (appendix C of the Protocol). The RMS noise is defined 
as the RMSD of the absorbance values in an analytical region from the 
mean absorbance value in the region.
    1.4.4 The MAU is the minimum analyte concentration for which the 
AU<INF>i</INF> can be maintained; if the measured analyte concentration 
is less than MAU<INF>i</INF> then data quality are unacceptable.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 Principle. References 4 through 7 provide background material on 
infrared spectroscopy and quantitative analysis. A summary is given in 
this section.
    2.1.1 Infrared absorption spectroscopy is performed by directing an 
infrared beam through a sample to a detector. The frequency-dependent 
infrared absorbance of the sample is measured by comparing this detector 
signal (single beam spectrum) to a signal obtained without a sample in 
the beam path (background).
    2.1.2 Most molecules absorb infrared radiation and the absorbance 
occurs in a characteristic and reproducible pattern. The infrared 
spectrum measures fundamental molecular properties and a compound can be 
identified from its infrared spectrum alone.
    2.1.3 Within constraints, there is a linear relationship between 
infrared absorption and compound concentration. If this frequency 
dependent relationship (absorptivity) is known (measured), it can be 
used to determine compound concentration in a sample mixture.
    2.1.4 Absorptivity is measured by preparing, in the laboratory, 
standard samples of compounds at known concentrations and measuring the 
FTIR ``reference spectra'' of these standard samples. These ``reference 
spectra'' are then used in sample analysis: (1) Compounds are detected 
by matching sample absorbance bands with bands in reference spectra, and 
(2) concentrations are measured by comparing sample band intensities 
with reference band intensities.
    2.1.5 This method is self-validating provided that the results meet 
the performance requirement of the QA spike in sections 8.6.2 and 9.0 of 
this method, and results from a previous method validation study support 
the use of this method in the application.
    2.2 Sampling and Analysis. In extractive sampling a probe assembly 
and pump are used to extract gas from the exhaust of the affected source 
and transport the sample to the FTIR gas cell. Typically, the sampling 
apparatus is similar to that used for single-component continuous 
emission monitor (CEM) measurements.
    2.2.1 The digitized infrared spectrum of the sample in the FTIR gas 
cell is measured and stored on a computer. Absorbance band intensities 
in the spectrum are related to sample concentrations by what is commonly 
referred to as Beer's Law.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.003

Where:

A<INF>i</INF> = absorbance at a given frequency of the ith sample 
component.
a<INF>i</INF> = absorption coefficient (absorptivity) of the ith sample 
component.
b = path length of the cell.

[[Page 487]]

c<INF>i</INF> = concentration of the ith sample component.

    2.2.2 Analyte spiking is used for quality assurance (QA). In this 
procedure (section 8.6.2 of this method) an analyte is spiked into the 
gas stream at the back end of the sample probe. Analyte concentrations 
in the spiked samples are compared to analyte concentrations in unspiked 
samples. Since the concentration of the spike is known, this procedure 
can be used to determine if the sampling system is removing the spiked 
analyte(s) from the sample stream.
    2.3 Reference Spectra Availability. Reference spectra of over 100 
HAPs are available in the EPA FTIR spectral library on the EMTIC 
(Emission Measurement Technical Information Center) computer bulletin 
board service and at internet address http://info.arnold.af.mil/epa/
welcome.htm. Reference spectra for HAPs, or other analytes, may also be 
prepared according to section 4.6 of the Protocol.
    2.4 Operator Requirements. The FTIR analyst shall be trained in 
setting up the instrumentation, verifying the instrument is functioning 
properly, and performing routine maintenance. The analyst must evaluate 
the initial sample spectra to determine if the sample matrix is 
consistent with pre-test assumptions and if the instrument configuration 
is suitable. The analyst must be able to modify the instrument 
configuration, if necessary.
    2.4.1 The spectral analysis shall be supervised by someone familiar 
with EPA FTIR Protocol procedures.
    2.4.2 A technician trained in instrumental test methods is qualified 
to install and operate the sampling system. This includes installing the 
probe and heated line assembly, operating the analyte spike system, and 
performing moisture and flow measurements.

                             3.0 Definitions

    See appendix A of the Protocol for definitions relating to infrared 
spectroscopy. Additional definitions are given in sections 3.1 through 
3.29.
    3.1 Analyte. A compound that this method is used to measure. The 
term ``target analyte'' is also used. This method is multi-component and 
a number of analytes can be targeted for a test.
    3.2 Reference Spectrum. Infrared spectrum of an analyte prepared 
under controlled, documented, and reproducible laboratory conditions 
according to procedures in section 4.6 of the Protocol. A library of 
reference spectra is used to measure analytes in gas samples.
    3.3 Standard Spectrum. A spectrum that has been prepared from a 
reference spectrum through a (documented) mathematical operation. A 
common example is de-resolving of reference spectra to lower-resolution 
standard spectra (Protocol, appendix K to the addendum of this method). 
Standard spectra, prepared by approved, and documented, procedures can 
be used as reference spectra for analysis.
    3.4 Concentration. In this method concentration is expressed as a 
molar concentration, in ppm-meters, or in (ppm-meters)/K, where K is the 
absolute temperature (Kelvin). The latter units allow the direct 
comparison of concentrations from systems using different optical 
configurations or sampling temperatures.
    3.5 Interferant. A compound in the sample matrix whose infrared 
spectrum overlaps with part of an analyte spectrum. The most accurate 
analyte measurements are achieved when reference spectra of interferants 
are used in the quantitative analysis with the analyte reference 
spectra. The presence of an interferant can increase the analytical 
uncertainty in the measured analyte concentration.
    3.6 Gas Cell. A gas containment cell that can be evacuated. It is 
equipped with the optical components to pass the infrared beam through 
the sample to the detector. Important cell features include: path length 
(or range if variable), temperature range, materials of construction, 
and total gas volume.
    3.7 Sampling System. Equipment used to extract the sample from the 
test location and transport the sample gas to the FTIR analyzer. This 
includes sample conditioning systems.
    3.8 Sample Analysis. The process of interpreting the infrared 
spectra to obtain sample analyte concentrations. This process is usually 
automated using a software routine employing a classical least squares 
(cls), partial least squares (pls), or K- or P-matrix method.
    3.9 One hundred percent line. A double beam transmittance spectrum 
obtained by combining two background single beam spectra. Ideally, this 
line is equal to 100 percent transmittance (or zero absorbance) at every 
frequency in the spectrum. Practically, a zero absorbance line is used 
to measure the baseline noise in the spectrum.
    3.10 Background Deviation. A deviation from 100 percent 
transmittance in any region of the 100 percent line. Deviations greater 
than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent in an analytical region are 
unacceptable (absorbance of 0.021 to -0.022). Such deviations indicate a 
change in the instrument throughput relative to the background single 
beam.
    3.11 Batch Sampling. A procedure where spectra of discreet, static 
samples are collected. The gas cell is filled with sample and the cell 
is isolated. The spectrum is collected. Finally, the cell is evacuated 
to prepare for the next sample.
    3.12 Continuous Sampling. A procedure where spectra are collected 
while sample gas

[[Page 488]]

is flowing through the cell at a measured rate.
    3.13 Sampling resolution. The spectral resolution used to collect 
sample spectra.
    3.14 Truncation. Limiting the number of interferogram data points by 
deleting points farthest from the center burst (zero path difference, 
ZPD).
    3.15 Zero filling. The addition of points to the interferogram. The 
position of each added point is interpolated from neighboring real data 
points. Zero filling adds no information to the interferogram, but 
affects line shapes in the absorbance spectrum (and possibly analytical 
results).
    3.16 Reference CTS. Calibration Transfer Standard spectra that were 
collected with reference spectra.
    3.17 CTS Standard. CTS spectrum produced by applying a de-resolution 
procedure to a reference CTS.
    3.18 Test CTS. CTS spectra collected at the sampling resolution 
using the same optical configuration as for sample spectra. Test spectra 
help verify the resolution, temperature and path length of the FTIR 
system.
    3.19 RMSD. Root Mean Square Difference, defined in EPA FTIR 
Protocol, appendix A.
    3.20 Sensitivity. The noise-limited compound-dependent detection 
limit for the FTIR system configuration. This is estimated by the MAU. 
It depends on the RMSD in an analytical region of a zero absorbance 
line.
    3.21 Quantitation Limit. The lower limit of detection for the FTIR 
system configuration in the sample spectra. This is estimated by 
mathematically subtracting scaled reference spectra of analytes and 
interferences from sample spectra, then measuring the RMSD in an 
analytical region of the subtracted spectrum. Since the noise in 
subtracted sample spectra may be much greater than in a zero absorbance 
spectrum, the quantitation limit is generally much higher than the 
sensitivity. Removing spectral interferences from the sample or 
improving the spectral subtraction can lower the quantitation limit 
toward (but not below) the sensitivity.
    3.22 Independent Sample. A unique volume of sample gas; there is no 
mixing of gas between two consecutive independent samples. In continuous 
sampling two independent samples are separated by at least 5 cell 
volumes. The interval between independent measurements depends on the 
cell volume and the sample flow rate (through the cell).
    3.23 Measurement. A single spectrum of flue gas contained in the 
FTIR cell.
    3.24 Run. A run consists of a series of measurements. At a minimum a 
run includes 8 independent measurements spaced over 1 hour.
    3.25 Validation. Validation of FTIR measurements is described in 
sections 13.0 through 13.4 of this method. Validation is used to verify 
the test procedures for measuring specific analytes at a source. 
Validation provides proof that the method works under certain test 
conditions.
    3.26 Validation Run. A validation run consists of at least 24 
measurements of independent samples. Half of the samples are spiked and 
half are not spiked. The length of the run is determined by the interval 
between independent samples.
    3.27 ning. Screening is used when there is little or no available 
information about a source. The purpose of screening is to determine 
what analytes are emitted and to obtain information about important 
sample characteristics such as moisture, temperature, and interferences. 
Screening results are semi-quantitative (estimated concentrations) or 
qualitative (identification only). Various optical and sampling 
configurations may be used. Sample conditioning systems may be evaluated 
for their effectiveness in removing interferences. It is unnecessary to 
perform a complete run under any set of sampling conditions. Spiking is 
not necessary, but spiking can be a useful screening tool for evaluating 
the sampling system, especially if a reactive or soluble analyte is used 
for the spike.
    3.28 Emissions Test. An FTIR emissions test is performed according 
specific sampling and analytical procedures. These procedures, for the 
target analytes and the source, are based on previous screening and 
validation results. Emission results are quantitative. A QA spike 
(sections 8.6.2 and 9.2 of this method) is performed under each set of 
sampling conditions using a representative analyte. Flow, gas 
temperature and diluent data are recorded concurrently with the FTIR 
measurements to provide mass emission rates for detected compounds.
    3.29 Surrogate. A surrogate is a compound that is used in a QA spike 
procedure (section 8.6.2 of this method) to represent other compounds. 
The chemical and physical properties of a surrogate shall be similar to 
the compounds it is chosen to represent. Under given sampling 
conditions, usually a single sampling factor is of primary concern for 
measuring the target analytes: for example, the surrogate spike results 
can be representative for analytes that are more reactive, more soluble, 
have a lower absorptivity, or have a lower vapor pressure than the 
surrogate itself.

                            4.0 Interferences

    Interferences are divided into two classifications: analytical and 
sampling.
    4.1 Analytical Interferences. An analytical interference is a 
spectral feature that complicates (in extreme cases may prevent) the 
analysis of an analyte. Analytical interferences are classified as 
background or spectral interference.
    4.1.1 Background Interference. This results from a change in 
throughput relative to the

[[Page 489]]

single beam background. It is corrected by collecting a new background 
and proceeding with the test. In severe instances the cause must be 
identified and corrected. Potential causes include: (1) Deposits on 
reflective surfaces or transmitting windows, (2) changes in detector 
sensitivity, (3) a change in the infrared source output, or (4) failure 
in the instrument electronics. In routine sampling throughput may 
degrade over several hours. Periodically a new background must be 
collected, but no other corrective action will be required.
    4.1.2 Spectral Interference. This results from the presence of 
interfering compound(s) (interferant) in the sample. Interferant 
spectral features overlap analyte spectral features. Any compound with 
an infrared spectrum, including analytes, can potentially be an 
interferant. The Protocol measures absorbance band overlap in each 
analytical region to determine if potential interferants shall be 
classified as known interferants (FTIR Protocol, section 4.9 and 
appendix B). Water vapor and CO<INF>2</INF> are common spectral 
interferants. Both of these compounds have strong infrared spectra and 
are present in many sample matrices at high concentrations relative to 
analytes. The extent of interference depends on the (1) interferant 
concentration, (2) analyte concentration, and (3) the degree of band 
overlap. Choosing an alternate analytical region can minimize or avoid 
the spectral interference. For example, CO<INF>2</INF> interferes with 
the analysis of the 670 cm<INF>-1</INF> benzene band. However, benzene 
can also be measured near 3000 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> (with less sensitivity).
    4.2 Sampling System Interferences. These prevent analytes from 
reaching the instrument. The analyte spike procedure is designed to 
measure sampling system interference, if any.
    4.2.1 Temperature. A temperature that is too low causes condensation 
of analytes or water vapor. The materials of the sampling system and the 
FTIR gas cell usually set the upper limit of temperature.
    4.2.2 Reactive Species. Anything that reacts with analytes. Some 
analytes, like formaldehyde, polymerize at lower temperatures.
    4.2.3 Materials. Poor choice of material for probe, or sampling line 
may remove some analytes. For example, HF reacts with glass components.
    4.2.4 Moisture. In addition to being a spectral interferant, 
condensed moisture removes soluble compounds.

                               5.0 Safety

    The hazards of performing this method are those associated with any 
stack sampling method and the same precautions shall be followed. Many 
HAPs are suspected carcinogens or present other serious health risks. 
Exposure to these compounds should be avoided in all circumstances. For 
instructions on the safe handling of any particular compound, refer to 
its material safety data sheet. When using analyte standards, always 
ensure that gases are properly vented and that the gas handling system 
is leak free. (Always perform a leak check with the system under maximum 
vacuum and, again, with the system at greater than ambient pressure.) 
Refer to section 8.2 of this method for leak check procedures. This 
method does not address all of the potential safety risks associated 
with its use. Anyone performing this method must follow safety and 
health practices consistent with applicable legal requirements and with 
prudent practice for each application.

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

    Note: Mention of trade names or specific products does not 
constitute endorsement by the Environmental Protection Agency.

    The equipment and supplies are based on the schematic of a sampling 
system shown in Figure 1. Either the batch or continuous sampling 
procedures may be used with this sampling system. Alternative sampling 
configurations may also be used, provided that the data quality 
objectives are met as determined in the post-analysis evaluation. Other 
equipment or supplies may be necessary, depending on the design of the 
sampling system or the specific target analytes.
    6.1 Sampling Probe. Glass, stainless steel, or other appropriate 
material of sufficient length and physical integrity to sustain heating, 
prevent adsorption of analytes, and to transport analytes to the 
infrared gas cell. Special materials or configurations may be required 
in some applications. For instance, high stack sample temperatures may 
require special steel or cooling the probe. For very high moisture 
sources it may be desirable to use a dilution probe.
    6.2 Particulate Filters. A glass wool plug (optional) inserted at 
the probe tip (for large particulate removal) and a filter (required) 
rated for 99 percent removal efficiency at 1-micron (e.g., Balston'') 
connected at the outlet of the heated probe.
    6.3 Sampling Line/Heating System. Heated (sufficient to prevent 
condensation) stainless steel, polytetrafluoroethane, or other material 
inert to the analytes.
    6.4 Gas Distribution Manifold. A heated manifold allowing the 
operator to control flows of gas standards and samples directly to the 
FTIR system or through sample conditioning systems. Usually includes 
heated flow meter, heated valve for selecting and sending sample to the 
analyzer, and a by-pass vent. This is typically constructed of stainless 
steel tubing and fittings, and high-temperature valves.
    6.5 Stainless Steel Tubing. Type 316, appropriate diameter (e.g., 3/
8 in.) and length for

[[Page 490]]

heated connections. Higher grade stainless may be desirable in some 
applications.
    6.6 Calibration/Analyte Spike Assembly. A three way valve assembly 
(or equivalent) to introduce analyte or surrogate spikes into the 
sampling system at the outlet of the probe upstream of the out-of-stack 
particulate filter and the FTIR analytical system.
    6.7 Mass Flow Meter (MFM). These are used for measuring analyte 
spike flow. The MFM shall be calibrated in the range of 0 to 5 L/min and 
be accurate to <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent (or better) of the flow 
meter span.
    6.8 Gas Regulators. Appropriate for individual gas standards.
    6.9 Polytetrafluoroethane Tubing. Diameter (e.g., \3/8\ in.) and 
length suitable to connect cylinder regulators to gas standard manifold.
    6.10 Sample Pump. A leak-free pump (e.g., KNF \TM\), with by-pass 
valve, capable of producing a sample flow rate of at least 10 L/min 
through 100 ft of sample line. If the pump is positioned upstream of the 
distribution manifold and FTIR system, use a heated pump that is 
constructed from materials non-reactive to the analytes. If the pump is 
located downstream of the FTIR system, the gas cell sample pressure will 
be lower than ambient pressure and it must be recorded at regular 
intervals.
    6.11 Gas Sample Manifold. Secondary manifold to control sample flow 
at the inlet to the FTIR manifold. This is optional, but includes a by-
pass vent and heated rotameter.
    6.12 Rotameter. A 0 to 20 L/min rotameter. This meter need not be 
calibrated.
    6.13 FTIR Analytical System. Spectrometer and detector, capable of 
measuring the analytes to the chosen detection limit. The system shall 
include a personal computer with compatible software allowing automated 
collection of spectra.
    6.14 FTIR Cell Pump. Required for the batch sampling technique, 
capable of evacuating the FTIR cell volume within 2 minutes. The pumping 
speed shall allow the operator to obtain 8 sample spectra in 1 hour.
    6.15 Absolute Pressure Gauge. Capable of measuring pressure from 0 
to 1000 mmHg to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.5 mmHg (e.g., Baratron 
\TM\).
    6.16 Temperature Gauge. Capable of measuring the cell temperature to 
within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 [deg]C.
    6.17 Sample Conditioning. One option is a condenser system, which is 
used for moisture removal. This can be helpful in the measurement of 
some analytes. Other sample conditioning procedures may be devised for 
the removal of moisture or other interfering species.
    6.17.1 The analyte spike procedure of section 9.2 of this method, 
the QA spike procedure of section 8.6.2 of this method, and the 
validation procedure of section 13 of this method demonstrate whether 
the sample conditioning affects analyte concentrations. Alternatively, 
measurements can be made with two parallel FTIR systems; one measuring 
conditioned sample, the other measuring unconditioned sample.
    6.17.2 Another option is sample dilution. The dilution factor 
measurement must be documented and accounted for in the reported 
concentrations. An alternative to dilution is to lower the sensitivity 
of the FTIR system by decreasing the cell path length, or to use a 
short-path cell in conjunction with a long path cell to measure more 
than one concentration range.

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards

    7.1 Analyte(s) and Tracer Gas. Obtain a certified gas cylinder 
mixture containing all of the analyte(s) at concentrations within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent of the emission source levels (expressed in 
ppm-meter/K). If practical, the analyte standard cylinder shall also 
contain the tracer gas at a concentration which gives a measurable 
absorbance at a dilution factor of at least 10:1. Two ppm SF<INF>6</INF> 
is sufficient for a path length of 22 meters at 250 [deg]F.
    7.2 Calibration Transfer Standard(s). Select the calibration 
transfer standards (CTS) according to section 4.5 of the FTIR Protocol. 
Obtain a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable 
gravimetric standard of the CTS (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent).
    7.3 Reference Spectra. Obtain reference spectra for each analyte, 
interferant, surrogate, CTS, and tracer. If EPA reference spectra are 
not available, use reference spectra prepared according to procedures in 
section 4.6 of the EPA FTIR Protocol.

                   8.0 Sampling and Analysis Procedure

    Three types of testing can be performed: (1) Screening, (2) 
emissions test, and (3) validation. Each is defined in section 3 of this 
method. Determine the purpose(s) of the FTIR test. Test requirements 
include: (a) AU<INF>i</INF>, DL<INF>i</INF>, overall fractional 
uncertainty, OFU<INF>i</INF>, maximum expected concentration 
(CMAX<INF>i</INF>), and t<INF>AN</INF> for each, (b) potential 
interferants, (c) sampling system factors, e.g., minimum absolute cell 
pressure, (P<INF>min</INF>), FTIR cell volume (V<INF>SS</INF>), 
estimated sample absorption pathlength, L<INF>S</INF>', estimated sample 
pressure, P<INF>S</INF>', T<INF>S</INF>', signal integration time 
(t<INF>SS</INF>), minimum instrumental linewidth, MIL, fractional error, 
and (d) analytical regions, e.g., m = 1 to M, lower wavenumber position, 
FLm, center wavenumber position, FC<INF>m</INF>, and upper wavenumber 
position, FU<INF>m</INF>, plus interferants, upper wavenumber position 
of the CTS absorption band, FFU<INF>m</INF>, lower wavenumber position 
of the CTS absorption band, FFL<INF>m</INF>, wavenumber range FNU to 
FNL. If necessary, sample and acquire an initial spectrum. From analysis 
of this preliminary spectrum determine a suitable operational path 
length. Set up the sampling train as shown in Figure 1 or use an 
appropriate alternative configuration. Sections 8.1 through 8.11 of this 
method provide guidance on pre-

[[Page 491]]

test calculations in the EPA protocol, sampling and analytical 
procedures, and post-test protocol calculations.
    8.1 Pretest Preparations and Evaluations. Using the procedure in 
section 4.0 of the FTIR Protocol, determine the optimum sampling system 
configuration for measuring the target analytes. Use available 
information to make reasonable assumptions about moisture content and 
other interferences.
    8.1.1 Analytes. Select the required detection limit (DL<INF>i</INF>) 
and the maximum permissible analytical uncertainty (AU<INF>i</INF>) for 
each analyte (labeled from 1 to i). Estimate, if possible, the maximum 
expected concentration for each analyte, CMAX<INF>i</INF>. The expected 
measurement range is fixed by DL<INF>i</INF> and CMAX<INF>i</INF> for 
each analyte (i).
    8.1.2 Potential Interferants. List the potential interferants. This 
usually includes water vapor and CO<INF>2</INF>, but may also include 
some analytes and other compounds.
    8.1.3. Optical Configuration. Choose an optical configuration that 
can measure all of the analytes within the absorbance range of .01 to 
1.0 (this may require more than one path length). Use Protocol sections 
4.3 to 4.8 for guidance in choosing a configuration and measuring CTS.
    8.1.4 Fractional Reproducibility Uncertainty (FRU<INF>i</INF>). The 
FRU is determined for each analyte by comparing CTS spectra taken before 
and after the reference spectra were measured. The EPA para-xylene 
reference spectra were collected on 10/31/91 and 11/01/91 with 
corresponding CTS spectra ``cts1031a,'' and ``cts1101b.'' The CTS 
spectra are used to estimate the reproducibility (FRU) in the system 
that was used to collect the references. The FRU must be < AU. Appendix 
E of the protocol is used to calculate the FRU from CTS spectra. Figure 
2 plots results for 0.25 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> CTS spectra in EPA reference 
library: S<INF>3</INF> (cts1101b-cts1031a), and S<INF>4</INF> 
[(cts1101b+cts1031a)/2]. The RMSD (SRMS) is calculated in the subtracted 
baseline, S<INF>3</INF>, in the corresponding CTS region from 850 to 
1065 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. The area (BAV) is calculated in the same region of 
the averaged CTS spectrum, S<INF>4</INF>.
    8.1.5 Known Interferants. Use appendix B of the EPA FTIR Protocol.
    8.1.6 Calculate the Minimum Analyte Uncertainty, MAU (section 1.3 of 
this method discusses MAU and protocol appendix D gives the MAU 
procedure). The MAU for each analyte, i, and each analytical region, m, 
depends on the RMS noise.
    8.1.7 Analytical Program. See FTIR Protocol, section 4.10. Prepare 
computer program based on the chosen analytical technique. Use as input 
reference spectra of all target analytes and expected interferants. 
Reference spectra of additional compounds shall also be included in the 
program if their presence (even if transient) in the samples is 
considered possible. The program output shall be in ppm (or ppb) and 
shall be corrected for differences between the reference path length, 
L<INF>R</INF>, temperature, T<INF>R</INF>, and pressure, P<INF>R</INF>, 
and the conditions used for collecting the sample spectra. If sampling 
is performed at ambient pressure, then any pressure correction is 
usually small relative to corrections for path length and temperature, 
and may be neglected.
    8.2 Leak-Check
    8.2.1 Sampling System. A typical FTIR extractive sampling train is 
shown in Figure 1. Leak check from the probe tip to pump outlet as 
follows: Connect a 0-to 250-mL/min rate meter (rotameter or bubble 
meter) to the outlet of the pump. Close off the inlet to the probe, and 
record the leak rate. The leak rate shall be <=200 mL/min.
    8.2.2 Analytical System Leak check. Leak check the FTIR cell under 
vacuum and under pressure (greater than ambient). Leak check connecting 
tubing and inlet manifold under pressure.
    8.2.2.1 For the evacuated sample technique, close the valve to the 
FTIR cell, and evacuate the absorption cell to the minimum absolute 
pressure P<INF>min</INF>. Close the valve to the pump, and determine the 
change in pressure [Delta]P<INF>v</INF> after 2 minutes.
    8.2.2.2 For both the evacuated sample and purging techniques, 
pressurize the system to about 100 mmHg above atmospheric pressure. 
Isolate the pump and determine the change in pressure 
[Delta]P<INF>p</INF> after 2 minutes.
    8.2.2.3 Measure the barometric pressure, P<INF>b</INF> in mmHg.
    8.2.2.4 Determine the percent leak volume %V<INF>L</INF> for the 
signal integration time t<INF>SS</INF> and for [Delta]P<INF>max</INF>, 
i.e., the larger of [Delta]P<INF>v</INF> or [Delta]P<INF>p</INF>, as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.004

where 50 = 100% divided by the leak-check time of 2 minutes. 8.2.2.5 
Leak volumes in excess of 4 percent of the FTIR system volume 
V<INF>SS</INF> are unacceptable.
    8.3 Detector Linearity. Once an optical configuration is chosen, use 
one of the procedures of sections 8.3.1 through 8.3.3 to verify that the 
detector response is linear. If the detector response is not linear, 
decrease the aperture, or attenuate the infrared beam. After a change in 
the instrument configuration perform a linearity check until it is 
demonstrated that the detector response is linear.
    8.3.1 Vary the power incident on the detector by modifying the 
aperture setting. Measure the background and CTS at three instrument 
aperture settings: (1) at the aperture setting to be used in the 
testing, (2) at one half this aperture and (3) at twice the proposed 
testing aperture. Compare the three CTS spectra. CTS band areas shall

[[Page 492]]

agree to within the uncertainty of the cylinder standard and the RMSD 
noise in the system. If test aperture is the maximum aperture, collect 
CTS spectrum at maximum aperture, then close the aperture to reduce the 
IR throughput by half. Collect a second background and CTS at the 
smaller aperture setting and compare the spectra again.
    8.3.2 Use neutral density filters to attenuate the infrared beam. 
Set up the FTIR system as it will be used in the test measurements. 
Collect a CTS spectrum. Use a neutral density filter to attenuate the 
infrared beam (either immediately after the source or the 
interferometer) to approximately \1/2\ its original intensity. Collect a 
second CTS spectrum. Use another filter to attenuate the infrared beam 
to approximately \1/4\ its original intensity. Collect a third 
background and CTS spectrum. Compare the CTS spectra. CTS band areas 
shall agree to within the uncertainty of the cylinder standard and the 
RMSD noise in the system.
    8.3.3 Observe the single beam instrument response in a frequency 
region where the detector response is known to be zero. Verify that the 
detector response is ``flat'' and equal to zero in these regions.
    8.4 Data Storage Requirements. All field test spectra shall be 
stored on a computer disk and a second backup copy must stored on a 
separate disk. The stored information includes sample interferograms, 
processed absorbance spectra, background interferograms, CTS sample 
interferograms and CTS absorbance spectra. Additionally, documentation 
of all sample conditions, instrument settings, and test records must be 
recorded on hard copy or on computer medium. Table 1 gives a sample 
presentation of documentation.
    8.5 Background Spectrum. Evacuate the gas cell to <=5 mmHg, and fill 
with dry nitrogen gas to ambient pressure (or purge the cell with 10 
volumes of dry nitrogen). Verify that no significant amounts of 
absorbing species (for example water vapor and CO<INF>2</INF>) are 
present. Collect a background spectrum, using a signal averaging period 
equal to or greater than the averaging period for the sample spectra. 
Assign a unique file name to the background spectrum. Store two copies 
of the background interferogram and processed single-beam spectrum on 
separate computer disks (one copy is the back-up).
    8.5.1 Interference Spectra. If possible, collect spectra of known 
and suspected major interferences using the same optical system that 
will be used in the field measurements. This can be done on-site or 
earlier. A number of gases, e.g. CO<INF>2</INF>, SO<INF>2</INF>, CO, 
NH<INF>3</INF>, are readily available from cylinder gas suppliers.
    8.5.2 Water vapor spectra can be prepared by the following 
procedure. Fill a sample tube with distilled water. Evacuate above the 
sample and remove dissolved gasses by alternately freezing and thawing 
the water while evacuating. Allow water vapor into the FTIR cell, then 
dilute to atmospheric pressure with nitrogen or dry air. If quantitative 
water spectra are required, follow the reference spectrum procedure for 
neat samples (protocol, section 4.6). Often, interference spectra need 
not be quantitative, but for best results the absorbance must be 
comparable to the interference absorbance in the sample spectra.
    8.6 Pre-Test Calibrations
    8.6.1 Calibration Transfer Standard. Evacuate the gas cell to <= 5 
mmHg absolute pressure, and fill the FTIR cell to atmospheric pressure 
with the CTS gas. Alternatively, purge the cell with 10 cell volumes of 
CTS gas. (If purge is used, verify that the CTS concentration in the 
cell is stable by collecting two spectra 2 minutes apart as the CTS gas 
continues to flow. If the absorbance in the second spectrum is no 
greater than in the first, within the uncertainty of the gas standard, 
then this can be used as the CTS spectrum.) Record the spectrum.
    8.6.2 QA Spike. This procedure assumes that the method has been 
validated for at least some of the target analytes at the source. For 
emissions testing perform a QA spike. Use a certified standard, if 
possible, of an analyte, which has been validated at the source. One 
analyte standard can serve as a QA surrogate for other analytes which 
are less reactive or less soluble than the standard. Perform the spike 
procedure of section 9.2 of this method. Record spectra of at least 
three independent (section 3.22 of this method) spiked samples. 
Calculate the spiked component of the analyte concentration. If the 
average spiked concentration is within 0.7 to 1.3 times the expected 
concentration, then proceed with the testing. If applicable, apply the 
correction factor from the Method 301 of this appendix validation test 
(not the result from the QA spike).
    8.7 Sampling. If analyte concentrations vary rapidly with time, 
continuous sampling is preferable using the smallest cell volume, 
fastest sampling rate and fastest spectra collection rate possible. 
Continuous sampling requires the least operator intervention even 
without an automated sampling system. For continuous monitoring at one 
location over long periods, Continuous sampling is preferred. Batch 
sampling and continuous static sampling are used for screening and 
performing test runs of finite duration. Either technique is preferred 
for sampling several locations in a matter of days. Batch sampling gives 
reasonably good time resolution and ensures that each spectrum measures 
a discreet (and unique) sample volume. Continuous static (and 
continuous) sampling provide a very stable background over long periods. 
Like batch sampling, continuous static sampling also ensures that each 
spectrum measures a unique sample volume. It is essential that the leak 
check procedure under

[[Page 493]]

vacuum (section 8.2 of this method) is passed if the batch sampling 
procedure is used. It is essential that the leak check procedure under 
positive pressure is passed if the continuous static or continuous 
sampling procedures are used. The sampling techniques are described in 
sections 8.7.1 through 8.7.2 of this method.
    8.7.1 Batch Sampling. Evacuate the absorbance cell to <=5 mmHg 
absolute pressure. Fill the cell with exhaust gas to ambient pressure, 
isolate the cell, and record the spectrum. Before taking the next 
sample, evacuate the cell until no spectral evidence of sample 
absorption remains. Repeat this procedure to collect eight spectra of 
separate samples in 1 hour.
    8.7.2 Continuous Static Sampling. Purge the FTIR cell with 10 cell 
volumes of sample gas. Isolate the cell, collect the spectrum of the 
static sample and record the pressure. Before measuring the next sample, 
purge the cell with 10 more cell volumes of sample gas.
    8.8 Sampling QA and Reporting
    8.8.1 Sample integration times shall be sufficient to achieve the 
required signal-to-noise ratio. Obtain an absorbance spectrum by filling 
the cell with N2. Measure the RMSD in each analytical region in this 
absorbance spectrum. Verify that the number of scans used is sufficient 
to achieve the target MAU.
    8.8.2 Assign a unique file name to each spectrum.
    8.8.3 Store two copies of sample interferograms and processed 
spectra on separate computer disks.
    8.8.4 For each sample spectrum, document the sampling conditions, 
the sampling time (while the cell was being filled), the time the 
spectrum was recorded, the instrumental conditions (path length, 
temperature, pressure, resolution, signal integration time), and the 
spectral file name. Keep a hard copy of these data sheets.
    8.9 Signal Transmittance. While sampling, monitor the signal 
transmittance. If signal transmittance (relative to the background) 
changes by 5 percent or more (absorbance = -.02 to .02) in any 
analytical spectral region, obtain a new background spectrum.
    8.10 Post-test CTS. After the sampling run, record another CTS 
spectrum.
    8.11 Post-test QA
    8.11.1 Inspect the sample spectra immediately after the run to 
verify that the gas matrix composition was close to the expected 
(assumed) gas matrix.
    8.11.2 Verify that the sampling and instrumental parameters were 
appropriate for the conditions encountered. For example, if the moisture 
is much greater than anticipated, it may be necessary to use a shorter 
path length or dilute the sample.
    8.11.3 Compare the pre- and post-test CTS spectra. The peak 
absorbance in pre- and post-test CTS must be <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 
percent of the mean value. See appendix E of the FTIR Protocol.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    Use analyte spiking (sections 8.6.2, 9.2 and 13.0 of this method) to 
verify that the sampling system can transport the analytes from the 
probe to the FTIR system.
    9.1 Spike Materials. Use a certified standard (accurate to <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent) of the target analyte, if one can be 
obtained. If a certified standard cannot be obtained, follow the 
procedures in section 4.6.2.2 of the FTIR Protocol.
    9.2 Spiking Procedure. QA spiking (section 8.6.2 of this method) is 
a calibration procedure used before testing. QA spiking involves 
following the spike procedure of sections 9.2.1 through 9.2.3 of this 
method to obtain at least three spiked samples. The analyte 
concentrations in the spiked samples shall be compared to the expected 
spike concentration to verify that the sampling/analytical system is 
working properly. Usually, when QA spiking is used, the method has 
already been validated at a similar source for the analyte in question. 
The QA spike demonstrates that the validated sampling/analytical 
conditions are being duplicated. If the QA spike fails then the 
sampling/analytical system shall be repaired before testing proceeds. 
The method validation procedure (section 13.0 of this method) involves a 
more extensive use of the analyte spike procedure of sections 9.2.1 
through 9.2.3 of this method. Spectra of at least 12 independent spiked 
and 12 independent unspiked samples are recorded. The concentration 
results are analyzed statistically to determine if there is a systematic 
bias in the method for measuring a particular analyte. If there is a 
systematic bias, within the limits allowed by Method 301 of this 
appendix, then a correction factor shall be applied to the analytical 
results. If the systematic bias is greater than the allowed limits, this 
method is not valid and cannot be used.
    9.2.1 Introduce the spike/tracer gas at a constant flow rate of <=10 
percent of the total sample flow, when possible.
    Note: Use the rotameter at the end of the sampling train to estimate 
the required spike/tracer gas flow rate.

    Use a flow device, e.g., mass flow meter (<greek-i> 2 percent), to 
monitor the spike flow rate. Record the spike flow rate every 10 
minutes.
    9.2.2 Determine the response time (RT) of the system by continuously 
collecting spectra of the spiked effluent until the spectrum of the 
spiked component is constant for 5 minutes. The RT is the interval from 
the first measurement until the spike becomes constant. Wait for twice 
the duration of the RT, then collect spectra of two independent spiked 
gas samples. Duplicate analyses of the spiked concentration shall be 
within 5

[[Page 494]]

percent of the mean of the two measurements.
    9.2.3 Calculate the dilution ratio using the tracer gas as follows: 
where:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.005

Where:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.006

DF=Dilution factor of the spike gas; this value shall be <ls-thn-eq>=10.

measured directly in undiluted spike gas.
SF<INF>6(spk)</INF>=Diluted SF<INF>6</INF> (or tracer gas) concentration 
measured in a spiked sample.
Spike\dir\=Concentration of the analyte in the spike standard measured 
by filling the FTIR cell directly.
CS=Expected concentration of the spiked samples.
Unspike=Native concentration of analytes in unspiked samples.

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    10.1 Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N). The RMSD in the noise must be less 
than one tenth of the minimum analyte peak absorbance in each analytical 
region. For example if the minimum peak absorbance is 0.01 at the 
required DL, then RMSD measured over the entire analytical region must 
be <=0.001.
    10.2 Absorbance Path length. Verify the absorbance path length by 
comparing reference CTS spectra to test CTS spectra. See appendix E of 
the FTIR Protocol.
    10.3 Instrument Resolution. Measure the line width of appropriate 
test CTS band(s) to verify instrument resolution. Alternatively, compare 
CTS spectra to a reference CTS spectrum, if available, measured at the 
nominal resolution.
    10.4 Apodization Function.In transforming the sample interferograms 
to absorbance spectra use the same apodization function that was used in 
transforming the reference spectra.
    10.5 FTIR Cell Volume. Evacuate the cell to <=5 mmHg. Measure the 
initial absolute temperature (T<INF>i</INF>) and absolute pressure 
(P<INF>i</INF>). Connect a wet test meter (or a calibrated dry gas 
meter), and slowly draw room air into the cell. Measure the meter volume 
(V<INF>m</INF>), meter absolute temperature (T<INF>m</INF>), and meter 
absolute pressure (P<INF>m</INF>); and the cell final absolute 
temperature (T<INF>f</INF>) and absolute pressure (P<INF>f</INF>). 
Calculate the FTIR cell volume VSS, including that of the connecting 
tubing, as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.007

                   11.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

    Analyte concentrations shall be measured using reference spectra 
from the EPA FTIR spectral library. When EPA library spectra are not 
available, the procedures in section 4.6 of the Protocol shall be 
followed to prepare reference spectra of all the target analytes.
    11.1 Spectral De-resolution. Reference spectra can be converted to 
lower resolution standard spectra (section 3.3 of this method) by 
truncating the original reference sample and background interferograms. 
Appendix K of the FTIR Protocol gives specific deresolution procedures. 
Deresolved spectra shall be transformed using the same apodization 
function and level of zero filling as the sample spectra. Additionally, 
pre-test FTIR protocol calculations (e.g., FRU, MAU, FCU) shall be 
performed using the de-resolved standard spectra.
    11.2 Data Analysis. Various analytical programs are available for 
relating sample absorbance to a concentration standard. Calculated 
concentrations shall be verified by analyzing residual baselines after 
mathematically subtracting scaled reference spectra from the sample 
spectra. A full description of the data analysis and calculations is 
contained in the FTIR Protocol (sections 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 and appendices). 
Correct the calculated concentrations in the sample spectra for 
differences in absorption path length and temperature between the 
reference and sample spectra using equation 6,

                         12.0 Method Performance

    12.1 Spectral Quality. Refer to the FTIR Protocol appendices for 
analytical requirements, evaluation of data quality, and analysis of 
uncertainty.
    12.2 Sampling QA/QC. The analyte spike procedure of section 9 of 
this method, the QA spike of section 8.6.2 of this method, and the 
validation procedure of section 13 of this method are used to evaluate 
the performance of the sampling system and to quantify sampling system 
effects, if any, on the measured concentrations. This method is self-
validating provided that the results meet the performance requirement of 
the QA spike in sections 9.0 and 8.6.2 of this method and results from a 
previous method validation study support the use of this method in the 
application. Several factors can contribute to uncertainty in the 
measurement of spiked samples. Factors which can be controlled to 
provide better accuracy in the spiking procedure are listed in sections 
12.2.1 through 12.2.4 of this method.
    12.2.1 Flow meter. An accurate mass flow meter is accurate to <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent of its span. If a flow of 1 L/min is monitored 
with such a MFM, which is calibrated in the range of 0-5 L/min, the flow 
measurement has an uncertainty of 5 percent. This may be improved by re-
calibrating the meter at the specific flow rate to be used.
    12.2.2 Calibration gas. Usually the calibration standard is 
certified to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent. With reactive 
analytes, such as HCl, the certified accuracy in a commercially 
available standard may be no better than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 
percent.
    12.2.3 Temperature. Temperature measurements of the cell shall be 
quite accurate. If practical, it is preferable to measure sample 
temperature directly, by inserting a thermocouple into the cell chamber 
instead of monitoring the cell outer wall temperature.
    12.2.4 Pressure. Accuracy depends on the accuracy of the barometer, 
but fluctuations in pressure throughout a day may be as much as 2.5 
percent due to weather variations.

                    13.0 Method Validation Procedure

    This validation procedure, which is based on EPA Method 301 (40 CFR 
part 63, appendix (A), may be used to validate this method for the 
analytes in a gas matrix. Validation at one source may also apply to 
another type of source, if it can be shown that the exhaust gas 
characteristics are similar at both sources.
    13.1 Section 5.3 of Method 301 (40 CFR part 63, appendix A), the 
Analyte Spike procedure, is used with these modifications. The 
statistical analysis of the results follows section 6.3 of EPA Method 
301. Section 3 of this method defines terms that are not defined in 
Method 301.
    13.1.1 The analyte spike is performed dynamically. This means the 
spike flow is continuous and constant as spiked samples are measured.
    13.1.2 The spike gas is introduced at the back of the sample probe.
    13.1.3 Spiked effluent is carried through all sampling components 
downstream of the probe.
    13.1.4 A single FTIR system (or more) may be used to collect and 
analyze spectra (not quadruplicate integrated sampling trains).
    13.1.5 All of the validation measurements are performed sequentially 
in a single ``run'' (section 3.26 of this method).
    13.1.6 The measurements analyzed statistically are each independent 
(section 3.22 of this method).
    13.1.7 A validation data set can consist of more than 12 spiked and 
12 unspiked measurements.
    13.2 Batch Sampling. The procedure in sections 13.2.1 through 13.2.2 
may be used for stable processes. If process emissions are highly 
variable, the procedure in section 13.2.3 shall be used.
    13.2.1 With a single FTIR instrument and sampling system, begin by 
collecting spectra of two unspiked samples. Introduce the spike flow 
into the sampling system and allow 10 cell volumes to purge the sampling 
system and FTIR cell. Collect spectra of two spiked samples. Turn off 
the spike and allow 10 cell volumes of unspiked sample to purge the FTIR 
cell. Repeat this procedure until the 24 (or more) samples are 
collected.
    13.2.2 In batch sampling, collect spectra of 24 distinct samples. 
(Each distinct sample consists of filling the cell to ambient pressure 
after the cell has been evacuated.)
    13.2.3 Alternatively, a separate probe assembly, line, and sample 
pump can be used for spiked sample. Verify and document that sampling 
conditions are the same in both the spiked and the unspiked sampling 
systems. This can be done by wrapping both sample lines in the same 
heated bundle. Keep the same flow rate in both sample lines. Measure 
samples in sequence in pairs. After two spiked samples are measured, 
evacuate the FTIR cell, and turn the manifold valve so that spiked 
sample flows to the FTIR cell. Allow the connecting line from the 
manifold to the FTIR cell to purge thoroughly (the

[[Page 496]]

time depends on the line length and flow rate). Collect a pair of spiked 
samples. Repeat the procedure until at least 24 measurements are 
completed.
    13.3 Simultaneous Measurements With Two FTIR Systems. If unspiked 
effluent concentrations of the target analyte(s) vary significantly with 
time, it may be desirable to perform synchronized measurements of spiked 
and unspiked sample. Use two FTIR systems, each with its own cell and 
sampling system to perform simultaneous spiked and unspiked 
measurements. The optical configurations shall be similar, if possible. 
The sampling configurations shall be the same. One sampling system and 
FTIR analyzer shall be used to measure spiked effluent. The other 
sampling system and FTIR analyzer shall be used to measure unspiked flue 
gas. Both systems shall use the same sampling procedure (i.e., batch or 
continuous).
    13.3.1 If batch sampling is used, synchronize the cell evacuation, 
cell filling, and collection of spectra. Fill both cells at the same 
rate (in cell volumes per unit time).
    13.3.2 If continuous sampling is used, adjust the sample flow 
through each gas cell so that the same number of cell volumes pass 
through each cell in a given time (i.e. TC<INF>1</INF> = 
TC<INF>2</INF>).
    13.4 Statistical Treatment. The statistical procedure of EPA Method 
301 of this appendix, section 6.3 is used to evaluate the bias and 
precision. For FTIR testing a validation ``run'' is defined as spectra 
of 24 independent samples, 12 of which are spiked with the analyte(s) 
and 12 of which are not spiked.
    13.4.1 Bias. Determine the bias (defined by EPA Method 301 of this 
appendix, section 6.3.2) using equation 7:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.009

Where:

B = Bias at spike level.
S<INF>m</INF> = Mean concentration of the analyte spiked samples.
CS = Expected concentration of the spiked samples.

    13.4.2 Correction Factor. Use section 6.3.2.2 of Method 301 of this 
appendix to evaluate the statistical significance of the bias. If it is 
determined that the bias is significant, then use section 6.3.3 of 
Method 301 to calculate a correction factor (CF). Analytical results of 
the test method are multiplied by the correction factor, if 0.7 <= CF <= 
1.3. If is determined that the bias is significant and CF <ls-thn-eq> 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>30 percent, then the test method is considered to 
``not valid.''
    13.4.3 If measurements do not pass validation, evaluate the sampling 
system, instrument configuration, and analytical system to determine if 
improper set-up or a malfunction was the cause. If so, repair the system 
and repeat the validation.

                        14.0 Pollution Prevention

    The extracted sample gas is vented outside the enclosure containing 
the FTIR system and gas manifold after the analysis. In typical method 
applications the vented sample volume is a small fraction of the source 
volumetric flow and its composition is identical to that emitted from 
the source. When analyte spiking is used, spiked pollutants are vented 
with the extracted sample gas. Approximately 1.6 x 10-\4\ to 3.2 x 10-
\4\ lbs of a single HAP may be vented to the atmosphere in a typical 
validation run of 3 hours. (This assumes a molar mass of 50 to 100 g, 
spike rate of 1.0 L/min, and a standard concentration of 100 ppm). 
Minimize emissions by keeping the spike flow off when not in use.

                          15.0 Waste Management

    Small volumes of laboratory gas standards can be vented through a 
laboratory hood. Neat samples must be packed and disposed according to 
applicable regulations. Surplus materials may be returned to supplier 
for disposal.

Addendum to Test Method 320--Protocol for the Use of Extractive Fourier 
   Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometry for the Analyses of Gaseous 
                    Emissions from Stationary Sources

                            1.0 Introduction

    The purpose of this addendum is to set general guidelines for the 
use of modern FTIR spectroscopic methods for the analysis of gas samples 
extracted from the effluent of stationary emission sources. This 
addendum outlines techniques for developing and evaluating such methods 
and sets basic requirements for reporting and quality assurance 
procedures.
    1.1 Nomenclature
    1.1.1 Appendix A to this addendum lists definitions of the symbols 
and terms used in this Protocol, many of which have been taken directly 
from American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) publication E 
131-90a, entitled ``Terminology Relating to Molecular Spectroscopy.''
    1.1.2 Except in the case of background spectra or where otherwise 
noted, the term ``spectrum'' refers to a double-beam spectrum in units 
of absorbance vs. wavenumber (cm<SUP>-1</SUP>).
    1.1.3 The term ``Study'' in this addendum refers to a publication 
that has been subjected to EPA- or peer-review.

               2.0 Applicability and Analytical Principle

    2.1 Applicability. This Protocol applies to the determination of 
compound-specific concentrations in single- and multiple-component gas 
phase samples using double-beam absorption spectroscopy in the mid-
infrared band. It does not specifically address other FTIR applications, 
such as single-beam spectroscopy, analysis of open-path (non-enclosed) 
samples, and continuous measurement techniques. If multiple 
spectrometers, absorption cells, or instrumental linewidths are used in 
such analyses, each distinct operational configuration of the system 
must be evaluated separately according to this Protocol.
    2.2 Analytical Principle
    2.2.1 In the mid-infrared band, most molecules exhibit 
characteristic gas phase absorption spectra that may be recorded by FTIR 
systems. Such systems consist of a source of mid-infrared radiation, an 
interferometer, an enclosed sample cell of known absorption pathlength, 
an infrared detector, optical elements for the transfer of infrared 
radiation between components, and gas flow control and measurement 
components. Adjunct and integral computer systems are used for 
controlling the instrument, processing the signal, and for performing 
both Fourier transforms and quantitative analyses of spectral data.

[[Page 499]]

    2.2.2 The absorption spectra of pure gases and of mixtures of gases 
are described by a linear absorbance theory referred to as Beer's Law. 
Using this law, modern FTIR systems use computerized analytical programs 
to quantify compounds by comparing the absorption spectra of known 
(reference) gas samples to the absorption spectrum of the sample gas. 
Some standard mathematical techniques used for comparisons are classical 
least squares, inverse least squares, cross-correlation, factor 
analysis, and partial least squares. Reference A describes several of 
these techniques, as well as additional techniques, such as 
differentiation methods, linear baseline corrections, and non-linear 
absorbance corrections.

             3.0 General Principles of Protocol Requirements

    The characteristics that distinguish FTIR systems from gas analyzers 
used in instrumental gas analysis methods (e.g., Methods 6C and 7E of 
appendix A to part 60 of this chapter) are: (1) Computers are necessary 
to obtain and analyze data; (2) chemical concentrations can be 
quantified using previously recorded infrared reference spectra; and (3) 
analytical assumptions and results, including possible effects of 
interfering compounds, can be evaluated after the quantitative analysis. 
The following general principles and requirements of this Protocol are 
based on these characteristics.
    3.1 Verifiability and Reproducibility of Results. Store all data and 
document data analysis techniques sufficient to allow an independent 
agent to reproduce the analytical results from the raw interferometric 
data.
    3.2 Transfer of Reference Spectra. To determine whether reference 
spectra recorded under one set of conditions (e.g., optical bench, 
instrumental linewidth, absorption pathlength, detector performance, 
pressure, and temperature) can be used to analyze sample spectra taken 
under a different set of conditions, quantitatively compare 
``calibration transfer standards'' (CTS) and reference spectra as 
described in this Protocol.
    Note: The CTS may, but need not, include analytes of interest). To 
effect this, record the absorption spectra of the CTS (a) immediately 
before and immediately after recording reference spectra and (b) 
immediately after recording sample spectra.
    3.3 Evaluation of FTIR Analyses. The applicability, accuracy, and 
precision of FTIR measurements are influenced by a number of 
interrelated factors, which may be divided into two classes:
    3.3.1 Sample-Independent Factors. Examples are system configuration 
and performance (e.g., detector sensitivity and infrared source output), 
quality and applicability of reference absorption spectra, and type of 
mathematical analyses of the spectra. These factors define the 
fundamental limitations of FTIR measurements for a given system 
configuration. These limitations may be estimated from evaluations of 
the system before samples are available. For example, the detection 
limit for the absorbing compound under a given set of conditions may be 
estimated from the system noise level and the strength of a particular 
absorption band. Similarly, the accuracy of measurements may be 
estimated from the analysis of the reference spectra.
    3.3.2 Sample-Dependent Factors. Examples are spectral interferants 
(e.g., water vapor and CO<INF>2</INF>) or the overlap of spectral 
features of different compounds and contamination deposits on reflective 
surfaces or transmitting windows. To maximize the effectiveness of the 
mathematical techniques used in spectral analysis, identification of 
interferants (a standard initial step) and analysis of samples (includes 
effect of other analytical errors) are necessary. Thus, the Protocol 
requires post-analysis calculation of measurement concentration 
uncertainties for the detection of these potential sources of 
measurement error.

                4.0 Pre-Test Preparations and Evaluations

    Before testing, demonstrate the suitability of FTIR spectrometry for 
the desired application according to the procedures of this section.
    4.1 Identify Test Requirements. Identify and record the test 
requirements described in sections 4.1.1 through 4.1.4 of this addendum. 
These values set the desired or required goals of the proposed analysis; 
the description of methods for determining whether these goals are 
actually met during the analysis comprises the majority of this 
Protocol.
    4.1.1 Analytes (specific chemical species) of interest. Label the 
analytes from i = 1 to I.
    4.1.2 Analytical uncertainty limit (AU<INF>i</INF>). The 
AU<INF>i</INF> is the maximum permissible fractional uncertainty of 
analysis for the i\th\ analyte concentration, expressed as a fraction of 
the analyte concentration in the sample.
    4.1.3 Required detection limit for each analyte (DL<INF>i</INF>, 
ppm). The detection limit is the lowest concentration of an analyte for 
which its overall fractional uncertainty (OFU<INF>i</INF>) is required 
to be less than its analytical uncertainty limit (AU<INF>i</INF>).
    4.1.4 Maximum expected concentration of each analyte 
(CMAX<INF>i</INF>, ppm).
    4.2 Identify Potential Interferants. Considering the chemistry of 
the process or results of previous studies, identify potential 
interferants, i.e., the major effluent constituents and any relatively 
minor effluent constituents that possess either strong absorption 
characteristics or strong structural similarities to any analyte of 
interest. Label them 1 through N<INF>j</INF>, where the subscript ``j'' 
pertains to potential interferants. Estimate

[[Page 500]]

the concentrations of these compounds in the effluent (CPOT<INF>j</INF>, 
ppm).
    4.3 Select and Evaluate the Sampling System. Considering the source, 
e.g., temperature and pressure profiles, moisture content, analyte 
characteristics, and particulate concentration), select the equipment 
for extracting gas samples. Recommended are a particulate filter, 
heating system to maintain sample temperature above the dew point for 
all sample constituents at all points within the sampling system 
(including the filter), and sample conditioning system (e.g., coolers, 
water-permeable membranes that remove water or other compounds from the 
sample, and dilution devices) to remove spectral interferants or to 
protect the sampling and analytical components. Determine the minimum 
absolute sample system pressure (P<INF>min</INF>, mmHg) and the infrared 
absorption cell volume (V<INF>SS</INF>, liter). Select the techniques 
and/or equipment for the measurement of sample pressures and 
temperatures.
    4.4 Select Spectroscopic System. Select a spectroscopic 
configuration for the application. Approximate the absorption pathlength 
(L<INF>S</INF>', meter), sample pressure (P<INF>S</INF>', kPa), absolute 
sample temperature T<INF>S</INF>', and signal integration period 
(t<INF>SS</INF>, seconds) for the analysis. Specify the nominal minimum 
instrumental linewidth (MIL) of the system. Verify that the fractional 
error at the approximate values P<INF>S</INF>' and T<INF>S</INF>' is 
less than one half the smallest value AU<INF>i</INF> (see section 4.1.2 
of this addendum).
    4.5 Select Calibration Transfer Standards (CTS's). Select CTS's that 
meet the criteria listed in sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3 of this 
addendum.
    Note: It may be necessary to choose preliminary analytical regions 
(see section 4.7 of this addendum), identify the minimum analyte 
linewidths, or estimate the system noise level (see section 4.12 of this 
addendum) before selecting the CTS. More than one compound may be needed 
to meet the criteria; if so, obtain separate cylinders for each 
compound.
    4.5.1 The central wavenumber position of each analytical region 
shall lie within 25 percent of the wavenumber position of at least one 
CTS absorption band.
    4.5.2 The absorption bands in section 4.5.1 of this addendum shall 
exhibit peak absorbances greater than ten times the value 
RMS<INF>EST</INF> (see section 4.12 of this addendum) but less than 1.5 
absorbance units.
    4.5.3 At least one absorption CTS band within the operating range of 
the FTIR instrument shall have an instrument-independent linewidth no 
greater than the narrowest analyte absorption band. Perform and document 
measurements or cite Studies to determine analyte and CTS compound 
linewidths.
    4.5.4 For each analytical region, specify the upper and lower 
wavenumber positions (FFU<INF>m</INF> and FFL<INF>m</INF>, respectively) 
that bracket the CTS absorption band or bands for the associated 
analytical region. Specify the wavenumber range, FNU to FNL, containing 
the absorption band that meets the criterion of section 4.5.3 of this 
addendum.
    4.5.5 Associate, whenever possible, a single set of CTS gas 
cylinders with a set of reference spectra. Replacement CTS gas cylinders 
shall contain the same compounds at concentrations within 5 percent of 
that of the original CTS cylinders; the entire absorption spectra (not 
individual spectral segments) of the replacement gas shall be scaled by 
a factor between 0.95 and 1.05 to match the original CTS spectra.
    4.6 Prepare Reference Spectra
    Note: Reference spectra are available in a permanent soft copy from 
the EPA spectral library on the EMTIC (Emission Measurement Technical 
Information Center) computer bulletin board; they may be used if 
applicable.
    4.6.1 Select the reference absorption pathlength (L<INF>R</INF>) of 
the cell.
    4.6.2 Obtain or prepare a set of chemical standards for each 
analyte, potential and known spectral interferants, and CTS. Select the 
concentrations of the chemical standards to correspond to the top of the 
desired range.
    4.6.2.1 Commercially-Prepared Chemical Standards. Chemical standards 
for many compounds may be obtained from independent sources, such as a 
specialty gas manufacturer, chemical company, or commercial laboratory. 
These standards (accurate to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent) 
shall be prepared according to EPA Traceability Protocol (see Reference 
D) or shall be traceable to NIST standards. Obtain from the supplier an 
estimate of the stability of the analyte concentration. Obtain and 
follow all of the supplier's recommendations for recertifying the 
analyte concentration.
    4.6.2.2 Self-Prepared Chemical Standards. Chemical standards may be 
prepared by diluting certified commercially prepared chemical gases or 
pure analytes with ultra-pure carrier (UPC) grade nitrogen according to 
the barometric and volumetric techniques generally described in 
Reference A, section A4.6.
    4.6.3 Record a set of the absorption spectra of the CTS {R1{time} , 
then a set of the reference spectra at two or more concentrations in 
duplicate over the desired range (the top of the range must be less than 
10 times that of the bottom), followed by a second set of CTS spectra 
{R2{time} . (If self-prepared standards are used, see section 4.6.5 of 
this addendum before disposing of any of the standards.) The maximum 
accepted standard concentration-pathlength product (ASCPP) for each 
compound shall be higher than the maximum estimated concentration-
pathlength products for both analytes and known interferants in the 
effluent gas. For

[[Page 501]]

each analyte, the minimum ASCPP shall be no greater than ten times the 
concentration-pathlength product of that analyte at its required 
detection limit.
    4.6.4 Permanently store the background and interferograms in 
digitized form. Document details of the mathematical process for 
generating the spectra from these interferograms. Record the sample 
pressure (P<INF>R</INF>), sample temperature (T<INF>R</INF>), reference 
absorption pathlength (L<INF>R</INF>), and interferogram signal 
integration period (t<INF>SR</INF>). Signal integration periods for the 
background interferograms shall be <ls-thn-eq>=t<INF>SR</INF>. Values of 
P<INF>R</INF>, L<INF>R</INF>, and t<INF>SR</INF> shall not deviate by 
more than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent from the time of recording 
[R1] to that of recording [R2].
    4.6.5 If self-prepared chemical standards are employed and spectra 
of only two concentrations are recorded for one or more compounds, 
verify the accuracy of the dilution technique by analyzing the prepared 
standards for those compounds with a secondary (non-FTIR) technique in 
accordance with sections 4.6.5.1 through 4.6.5.4 of this addendum.
    4.6.5.1 Record the response of the secondary technique to each of 
the four standards prepared.
    4.6.5.2 Perform a linear regression of the response values 
(dependant variable) versus the accepted standard concentration (ASC) 
values (independent variable), with the regression constrained to pass 
through the zero-response, zero ASC point.
    4.6.5.3 Calculate the average fractional difference between the 
actual response values and the regression-predicted values (those 
calculated from the regression line using the four ASC values as the 
independent variable).
    4.6.5.4 If the average fractional difference value calculated in 
section 4.6.5.3 of this addendum is larger for any compound than the 
corresponding AU<INF>i</INF>, the dilution technique is not sufficiently 
accurate and the reference spectra prepared are not valid for the 
analysis.
    4.7 Select Analytical Regions. Using the general considerations in 
section 7 of Reference A and the spectral characteristics of the 
analytes and interferants, select the analytical regions for the 
application. Label them m = 1 to M. Specify the lower, center and upper 
wavenumber positions of each analytical region (FL<INF>m</INF>, 
FC<INF>m</INF>, and FU<INF>m</INF>, respectively). Specify the analytes 
and interferants which exhibit absorption in each region.
    4.8 Determine Fractional Reproducibility Uncertainties. Using 
appendix E of this addendum, calculate the fractional reproducibility 
uncertainty for each analyte (FRU<INF>i</INF>) from a comparison of [R1] 
and [R2]. If FRU<INF>i</INF> <ls-thn-eq> AU<INF>i</INF> for any analyte, 
the reference spectra generated in accordance with section 4.6 of this 
addendum are not valid for the application.
    4.9 Identify Known Interferants. Using appendix B of this addendum, 
determine which potential interferants affect the analyte concentration 
determinations. Relabel these potential interferant as ``known'' 
interferants, and designate these compounds from k = 1 to K. Appendix B 
to this addendum also provides criteria for determining whether the 
selected analytical regions are suitable.
    4.10 Prepare Computerized Analytical Programs
    4.10.1 Choose or devise mathematical techniques (e.g, classical 
least squares, inverse least squares, cross-correlation, and factor 
analysis) based on equation 4 of Reference A that are appropriate for 
analyzing spectral data by comparison with reference spectra.
    4.10.2 Following the general recommendations of Reference A, prepare 
a computer program or set of programs that analyzes all of the analytes 
and known interferants, based on the selected analytical regions 
(section 4.7 of this addendum) and the prepared reference spectra 
(section 4.6 of this addendum). Specify the baseline correction 
technique (e.g., determining the slope and intercept of a linear 
baseline contribution in each analytical region) for each analytical 
region, including all relevant wavenumber positions.
    4.10.3 Use programs that provide as output [at the reference 
absorption pathlength (L<INF>R</INF>), reference gas temperature 
(T<INF>R</INF>), and reference gas pressure (P<INF>R</INF>)] the analyte 
concentrations, the known interferant concentrations, and the baseline 
slope and intercept values. If the sample absorption pathlength 
(L<INF>S</INF>), sample gas temperature (T<INF>S</INF>), or sample gas 
pressure (P<INF>S</INF>) during the actual sample analyses differ from 
L<INF>R</INF>, T<INF>R</INF>, and P<INF>R</INF>, use a program or set of 
programs that applies multiplicative corrections to the derived 
concentrations to account for these variations, and that provides as 
output both the corrected and uncorrected values. Include in the report 
of the analysis (see section 7.0 of this addendum) the details of any 
transformations applied to the original reference spectra (e.g., 
differentiation), in such a fashion that all analytical results may be 
verified by an independent agent from the reference spectra and data 
spectra alone.
    4.11 Determine the Fractional Calibration Uncertainty. Calculate the 
fractional calibration uncertainty for each analyte (FCUi) according to 
appendix F of this addendum, and compare these values to the fractional 
uncertainty limits (AU<INF>i</INF>; see section 4.1.2 of this addendum). 
If FCU<INF>i</INF> <ls-thn-eq>AU<INF>i</INF>, either the reference 
spectra or analytical programs for that analyte are unsuitable.
    4.12 Verify System Configuration Suitability. Using appendix C of 
this addendum, measure or obtain estimates of the noise level 
(RMS<INF>EST</INF>, absorbance) of the FTIR system. Alternatively, 
construct the complete spectrometer system and determine the values

[[Page 502]]

RMS<INF>Sm</INF> using appendix G of this addendum. Estimate the minimum 
measurement uncertainty for each analyte (MAU<INF>i</INF>, ppm) and 
known interferant (MIU<INF>k</INF>, ppm) using appendix D of this 
addendum. Verify that (a) MAU<INF>i</INF> < 
(AU<INF>i</INF>)(DL<INF>i</INF>), FRUi < AU<INF>i</INF>, and FCUi < 
AU<INF>i</INF> for each analyte and that (b) the CTS chosen meets the 
requirements listed in sections 4.5.1 through 4.5.5 of this addendum.

                   5.0 Sampling and Analysis Procedure

    5.1 Analysis System Assembly and Leak-Test. Assemble the analysis 
system. Allow sufficient time for all system components to reach the 
desired temperature. Then, determine the leak-rate (L<INF>R</INF>) and 
leak volume (V<INF>L</INF>), where V<INF>L</INF>=L<INF>R</INF> 
t<INF>SS</INF>. Leak volumes shall be <=4 percent of V<INF>SS</INF>.
    5.2 Verify Instrumental Performance. Measure the noise level of the 
system in each analytical region using the procedure of appendix G of 
this addendum. If any noise level is higher than that estimated for the 
system in section 4.12 of this addendum, repeat the calculations of 
appendix D of this addendum and verify that the requirements of section 
4.12 of this addendum are met; if they are not, adjust or repair the 
instrument and repeat this section.
    5.3 Determine the Sample Absorption Pathlength
    Record a background spectrum. Then, fill the absorption cell with 
CTS at the pressure P<INF>R</INF> and record a set of CTS spectra [R3]. 
Store the background and unscaled CTS single beam interferograms and 
spectra. Using appendix H of this addendum, calculate the sample 
absorption pathlength (L<INF>S</INF>) for each analytical region. The 
values L<INF>S</INF> shall not differ from the approximated sample 
pathlength L<INF>S</INF>' (see section 4.4 of this addendum) by more 
than 5 percent.
    5.4 Record Sample Spectrum. Connect the sample line to the source. 
Either evacuate the absorption cell to an absolute pressure below 5 mmHg 
before extracting a sample from the effluent stream into the absorption 
cell, or pump at least ten cell volumes of sample through the cell 
before obtaining a sample. Record the sample pressure P<INF>S</INF>. 
Generate the absorbance spectrum of the sample. Store the background and 
sample single beam interferograms, and document the process by which the 
absorbance spectra are generated from these data. (If necessary, apply 
the spectral transformations developed in section 5.6.2 of this 
addendum). The resulting sample spectrum is referred to below as 
S<INF>S</INF>.

    Note: Multiple sample spectra may be recorded according to the 
procedures of section 5.4 of this addendum before performing sections 
5.5 and 5.6 of this addendum.

    5.5 Quantify Analyte Concentrations. Calculate the unscaled analyte 
concentrations RUA<INF>i</INF> and unscaled interferant concentrations 
RUI<INF>K</INF> using the programs developed in section 4 of this 
addendum. To correct for pathlength and pressure variations between the 
reference and sample spectra, calculate the scaling factor, 
R<INF>LPS</INF> using equation A.1,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.012

Calculate the final analyte and interferant concentrations 
RSA<INF>i</INF> and RSI<INF>k</INF> using equations A.2 and A.3,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.013

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.014

    5.6 Determine Fractional Analysis Uncertainty. Fill the absorption 
cell with CTS at the pressure P<INF>S</INF>. Record a set of CTS spectra 
[R4]. Store the background and CTS single beam interferograms. Using 
appendix H of this addendum, calculate the fractional analysis 
uncertainty (FAU) for each analytical region. If the FAU indicated for 
any analytical region is greater than the required accuracy requirements 
determined in sections 4.1.1 through 4.1.4 of this addendum, then 
comparisons to previously recorded reference spectra are invalid in that 
analytical region, and the analyst shall perform one or both of the 
procedures of sections 5.6.1 through 5.6.2 of this addendum.
    5.6.1 Perform instrumental checks and adjust the instrument to 
restore its performance to acceptable levels. If adjustments are made, 
repeat sections 5.3, 5.4 (except for the recording of a sample 
spectrum), and 5.5 of this addendum to demonstrate that acceptable 
uncertainties are obtained in all analytical regions.
    5.6.2 Apply appropriate mathematical transformations (e.g., 
frequency shifting, zero-filling, apodization, smoothing) to the spectra 
(or to the interferograms upon which the spectra are based) generated 
during the performance of the procedures of section 5.3 of this 
addendum. Document these transformations and their reproducibility. Do 
not apply multiplicative scaling of the spectra, or any set of 
transformations that is mathematically equivalent to multiplicative 
scaling. Different transformations may be applied to different 
analytical regions. Frequency shifts shall be less than one-half the 
minimum instrumental linewidth, and must be applied to all spectral data 
points in an analytical region. The mathematical transformations may be 
retained for the analysis if they are also applied to the appropriate 
analytical regions of all sample spectra recorded, and if all original 
sample spectra are digitally stored. Repeat sections 5.3, 5.4 (except 
the recording of a sample spectrum), and 5.5 of this addendum to 
demonstrate that these transformations lead to acceptable calculated 
concentration uncertainties in all analytical regions.

                      6.0 Post-Analysis Evaluations

    Estimate the overall accuracy of the analyses performed in 
accordance with sections 5.1 through 5.6 of this addendum using the 
procedures of sections 6.1 through 6.3 of this addendum.
    6.1 Qualitatively Confirm the Assumed Matrix. Examine each 
analytical region of the sample spectrum for spectral evidence of 
unexpected or unidentified interferants. If found, identify the 
interfering compounds (see Reference C for guidance) and add them to the 
list of known interferants. Repeat the procedures of section 4 of this 
addendum to include the interferants in the uncertainty calculations and 
analysis procedures. Verify that the MAU and FCU values do not increase 
beyond acceptable levels for the application requirements. Re-calculate 
the analyte concentrations (section 5.5 of this addendum) in the 
affected analytical regions.
    6.2 Quantitatively Evaluate Fractional Model Uncertainty (FMU). 
Perform the procedures of either section 6.2.1 or 6.2.2 of this 
addendum:
    6.2.1 Using appendix I of this addendum, determine the fractional 
model error (FMU) for each analyte.
    6.2.2 Provide statistically determined uncertainties FMU for each 
analyte which are equivalent to two standard deviations at the 95 
percent confidence level. Such determinations, if employed, must be 
based on mathematical examinations of the pertinent sample spectra (not 
the reference spectra alone). Include in the report of the analysis (see 
section 7.0 of this addendum) a complete description of the 
determination of the concentration uncertainties.
    6.3 Estimate Overall Concentration Uncertainty (OCU). Using appendix 
J of this addendum, determine the overall concentration uncertainty 
(OCU) for each analyte. If the OCU is larger than the required accuracy 
for any analyte, repeat sections 4 and 6 of this addendum.

                       7.0 Reporting Requirements

[Documentation pertaining to virtually all the procedures of sections 4, 
5, and 6 will be required. Software copies of reference spectra and 
sample spectra will be retained for some minimum time following the 
actual testing.]

 Appendix A to Addendum to Method 320--Definitions of Terms and Symbols

    A.1 Definitions of Terms. All terms used in this method that are not 
defined below have the meaning given to them in the CAA and in subpart A 
of this part.
    Absorption band means a contiguous wavenumber region of a spectrum 
(equivalently, a contiguous set of absorbance spectrum data points) in 
which the absorbance passes through a maximum or a series of maxima.
    Absorption pathlength means the distance in a spectrophotometer, 
measured in the direction of propagation of the beam of radiant energy, 
between the surface of the specimen on which the radiant energy is 
incident and the surface of the specimen from which it is emergent.
    Analytical region means a contiguous wavenumber region 
(equivalently, a contiguous set of absorbance spectrum data points) used 
in the quantitative analysis for one or more analytes.

    Note: The quantitative result for a single analyte may be based on 
data from more than one analytical region.

    Apodization means modification of the ILS function by multiplying 
the interferogram by a weighing function whose magnitude varies with 
retardation.
    Background spectrum means the single beam spectrum obtained with all 
system components without sample present.
    Baseline means any line drawn on an absorption spectrum to establish 
a reference point that represents a function of the radiant power 
incident on a sample at a given wavelength.
    Beers's law means the direct proportionality of the absorbance of a 
compound in a homogeneous sample to its concentration.
    Calibration transfer standard (CTS) gas means a gas standard of a 
compound used to achieve and/or demonstrate suitable quantitative 
agreement between sample spectra and the reference spectra; see section 
4.5.1 of this addendum.
    Compound means a substance possessing a distinct, unique molecular 
structure.
    Concentration (c) means the quantity of a compound contained in a 
unit quantity of sample. The unit ``ppm'' (number, or mole, basis) is 
recommended.
    Concentration-pathlength product means the mathematical product of 
concentration of

[[Page 504]]

the species and absorption pathlength. For reference spectra, this is a 
known quantity; for sample spectra, it is the quantity directly 
determined from Beer's law. The units ``centimeters-ppm'' or ``meters-
ppm'' are recommended.
    Derivative absorption spectrum means a plot of rate of change of 
absorbance or of any function of absorbance with respect to wavelength 
or any function of wavelength.
    Double beam spectrum means a transmission or absorbance spectrum 
derived by dividing the sample single beam spectrum by the background 
spectrum.

    Note: The term ``double-beam'' is used elsewhere to denote a 
spectrum in which the sample and background interferograms are collected 
simultaneously along physically distinct absorption paths. Here, the 
term denotes a spectrum in which the sample and background 
interferograms are collected at different times along the same 
absorption path.

    Fast Fourier transform (FFT) means a method of speeding up the 
computation of a discrete FT by factoring the data into sparse matrices 
containing mostly zeros.
    Flyback means interferometer motion during which no data are 
recorded.
    Fourier transform (FT) means the mathematical process for converting 
an amplitude-time spectrum to an amplitude-frequency spectrum, or vice 
versa.
    Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer means an analytical 
system that employs a source of mid-infrared radiation, an 
interferometer, an enclosed sample cell of known absorption pathlength, 
an infrared detector, optical elements that transfer infrared radiation 
between components, and a computer system. The time-domain detector 
response (interferogram) is processed by a Fourier transform to yield a 
representation of the detector response vs. infrared frequency.

    Note: When FTIR spectrometers are interfaced with other instruments, 
a slash should be used to denote the interface; e.g., GC/FTIR; HPCL/
FTIR, and the use of FTIR should be explicit; i.e., FTIR not IR.

    Frequency, v means the number of cycles per unit time.
    Infrared means the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum 
containing wavelengths from approximately 0.78 to 800 microns.
    Interferogram, I([sigma]) means record of the modulated component of 
the interference signal measured as a function of retardation by the 
detector.
    Interferometer means device that divides a beam of radiant energy 
into two or more paths, generates an optical path difference between the 
beams, and recombines them in order to produce repetitive interference 
maxima and minima as the optical retardation is varied.
    Linewidth means the full width at half maximum of an absorption band 
in units of wavenumbers (cm<SUP>-1</SUP>).
    Mid-infrared means the region of the electromagnetic spectrum from 
approximately 400 to 5000 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>.
    Reference spectra means absorption spectra of gases with known 
chemical compositions, recorded at a known absorption pathlength, which 
are used in the quantitative analysis of gas samples.
    Retardation, [sigma] means optical path difference between two beams 
in an interferometer; also known as ``optical path difference'' or 
``optical retardation.''
    Scan means digital representation of the detector output obtained 
during one complete motion of the interferometer's moving assembly or 
assemblies.
    Scaling means application of a multiplicative factor to the 
absorbance values in a spectrum.
    Single beam spectrum means Fourier-transformed interferogram, 
representing the detector response vs. wavenumber.

    Note: The term ``single-beam'' is used elsewhere to denote any 
spectrum in which the sample and background interferograms are recorded 
on the same physical absorption path; such usage differentiates such 
spectra from those generated using interferograms recorded along two 
physically distinct absorption paths (see ``double-beam spectrum'' 
above). Here, the term applies (for example) to the two spectra used 
directly in the calculation of transmission and absorbance spectra of a 
sample.

    Standard reference material means a reference material, the 
composition or properties of which are certified by a recognized 
standardizing agency or group.

    Note: The equivalent ISO term is ``certified reference material.''

    Transmittance, T means the ratio of radiant power transmitted by the 
sample to the radiant power incident on the sample. Estimated in FTIR 
spectroscopy by forming the ratio of the single-beam sample and 
background spectra.
    Wavenumber, v means the number of waves per unit length.

    Note: The usual unit of wavenumber is the reciprocal centimeter, 
cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. The wavenumber is the reciprocal of the wavelength, 
[lambda], when [lambda] is expressed in centimeters.

    Zero-filling means the addition of zero-valued points to the end of 
a measured interferogram.

    Note: Performing the FT of a zero-filled interferogram results in 
correctly interpolated points in the computed spectrum.

 Appendix B to Addendum to Method 320--Identifying Spectral Interferants

                               B.1 General

    B.1.1 Assume a fixed absorption pathlength equal to the value 
L<INF>S</INF>'.
    B.1.2 Use band area calculations to compare the relative absorption 
strengths of the analytes and potential interferants. In the m\th\ 
analytical region (FL<INF>m</INF> to FU<INF>m</INF>), use either 
rectangular or trapezoidal approximations to determine the band areas 
described below (see Reference A, sections A.3.1 through A.3.3). 
Document any baseline corrections applied to the spectra.
    B.1.3 Use the average total absorbance of the analytes and potential 
interferants in each analytical region to determine whether the 
analytical region is suitable for analyte concentration determinations.

    Note: The average absorbance in an analytical region is the band 
area divided by the width of the analytical region in wavenumbers. The 
average total absorbance in an analytical region is the sum of the 
average absorbances of all analytes and potential interferants.

                            B.2 Calculations

    B.2.1 Prepare spectral representations of each analyte at the 
concentration CL<INF>i</INF> = (DL<INF>i</INF>)(AU<INF>i</INF>), where 
DL<INF>i</INF> is the required detection limit and AU<INF>i</INF> is the 
maximum permissible analytical uncertainty. For the m\th\ analytical 
region, calculate the band area (AAI<INF>im</INF>) and average 
absorbance (AAV<INF>im</INF>) from these scaled analyte spectra.
    B.2.2 Prepare spectral representations of each potential interferant 
at its expected concentration (CPOT<INF>j</INF>). For the m\th\ 
analytical region, calculate the band area (IAI<INF>jm</INF>) and 
average absorbance (IAV<INF>jm</INF>) from these scaled potential 
interferant spectra.
    B.2.3 Repeat the calculation for each analytical region, and record 
the band area results in matrix form as indicated in Figure B.1.
    B.2.4 If the band area of any potential interferant in an analytical 
region is greater than the one-half the band area of any analyte (i.e., 
IAI<INF>jm</INF> <ls-thn-eq> 0.5 AAI<INF>im</INF> for any pair ij and 
any m), classify the potential interferant as a known interferant. Label 
the known interferants k = 1 to K. Record the results in matrix form as 
indicated in Figure B.2.
    B.2.5 Calculate the average total absorbance (AVT<INF>m</INF>) for 
each analytical region and record the values in the last row of the 
matrix described in Figure B.2. Any analytical region where 
AVT<INF>m</INF> <ls-thn-eq> 2.0 is unsuitable.

      Appendix C to Addendum to Method 320--Estimating Noise Levels

                               C.1 General

    C.1.1 The root-mean-square (RMS) noise level is the standard measure 
of noise in this addendum. The RMS noise level of a contiguous segment 
of a spectrum is defined as the RMS difference (RMSD) between the 
absorbance values which form the segment and the mean value of that 
segment (see appendix A of this addendum).
    C.1.2 The RMS noise value in double-beam absorbance spectra is 
assumed to be inversely proportional to: (a) the square root of the 
signal integration period of the sample single beam spectra from which 
it is formed, and (b) the total infrared power transmitted through the 
interferometer and absorption cell.
    C.1.3 Practically, the assumption of C.1.2 allows the RMS noise 
level of a complete system to be estimated from the quantities described 
in sections C.1.3.1 through C.1.3.4:
    C.1.3.1 RMS<INF>MAN</INF>, the noise level of the system (in 
absorbance units), without the absorption cell and transfer optics, 
under those conditions necessary to yield the specified minimum 
instrumental linewidth, e.g., Jacquinot stop size.
    C.1.3.2 t<INF>MAN</INF>, the manufacturer's signal integration time 
used to determine RMS<INF>MAN</INF>.
    C.1.3.3 t<INF>SS</INF>, the signal integration time for the 
analyses.
    C.1.3.4 TP, the manufacturer's estimate of the fraction of the total

 Appendix D to Addendum to Method 320--Estimating Minimum Concentration 
                 Measurement Uncertainties (MAU and MIU)

                               D.1 General

    Estimate the minimum concentration measurement uncertainties for the 
i\th\ analyte (MAU<INF>i</INF>) and j\th\ interferant (MIU<INF>j</INF>) 
based on the spectral data in the m\th\ analytical region by comparing 
the analyte band area in the analytical region (AAI<INF>im</INF>) and 
estimating or measuring the noise level of the system (RMS<INF>EST</INF> 
or RMS<INF>SM</INF>).

    Note: For a single analytical region, the MAU or MIU value is the 
concentration of the analyte or interferant for which the band area is 
equal to the product of the analytical region width (in wavenumbers) and 
the noise level of the system (in absorbance units). If data from more 
than one analytical region are used in the determination of an analyte 
concentration, the MAU or MIU is the mean of the separate MAU or MIU 
values calculated for each analytical region.

                            D.2 Calculations

    D.2.1 For each analytical region, set RMS = RMS<INF>SM</INF> if 
measured (appendix G of this addendum), or set RMS = RMS<INF>EST</INF> 
if estimated (appendix C of this addendum).
    D.2.2 For each analyte associated with the analytical region, 
calculate MAU<INF>im</INF> using equation D.1,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.020

    D.2.3 If only the m\th\ analytical region is used to calculate the 
concentration of the i\th\ analyte, set MAU<INF>i</INF> = 
MAU<INF>im</INF>.
    D.2.4 If more than one analytical region is used to calculate the 
concentration of the i\th\ analyte, set MAU<INF>i</INF> equal to the 
weighted mean of the appropriate MAU<INF>im</INF> values calculated 
above; the weight for each term in the mean is equal to the fraction of 
the total wavenumber range used for the calculation

represented by each analytical region. Mathematically, if the set of 
analytical regions employed is [m'], then the MAU for each analytical 
region is given by equation D.2.

    D.2.5 Repeat sections D.2.1 through D.2.4 of this appendix to 
calculate the analogous values MIU<INF>j</INF> for the interferants j = 
1 to J. Replace the value (AU<INF>i</INF>) (DL<INF>i</INF>) in equation 
D.1 with CPOT<INF>j</INF>/20; replace the value AAI<INF>im</INF> in 
equation D.1 with IAI<INF>jm</INF>.

      Appendix E to Addendum to Method 320--Determining Fractional 
                   Reproducibility Uncertainties (FRU)

                               E.1 General

    To estimate the reproducibility of the spectroscopic results of the 
system, compare the CTS spectra recorded before and after preparing the 
reference spectra. Compare the difference between the spectra to their 
average band area. Perform the calculation for each analytical region on 
the portions of the CTS spectra associated with that analytical region.

                            E.2 Calculations

    E.2.1 The CTS spectra {R1{time}  consist of N spectra, denoted by 
S<INF>1i</INF>, i=1, N. Similarly, the CTS spectra {R2{time}  consist of 
N spectra, denoted by S<INF>2i</INF>, i=1, N. Each S<INF>ki</INF> is the 
spectrum of a single compound, where i denotes the compound and k 
denotes the set {{time}  of which S<INF>ki</INF> is a member. Form the 
spectra S<INF>3</INF> according to S<INF>3i</INF> = S<INF>2i</INF>-
S<INF>1i</INF> for each i. Form the spectra S<INF>4</INF> according to 
S<INF>4i</INF> = [S<INF>2i</INF>+S<INF>1i</INF>]/2 for each i.
    E.2.2 Each analytical region m is associated with a portion of the 
CTS spectra S<INF>2i</INF> and S<INF>1i</INF>, for a particular i, with 
lower and upper wavenumber limits FFL<INF>m</INF> and FFU<INF>m</INF>, 
respectively.
    E.2.3 For each m and the associated i, calculate the band area of 
S<INF>4i</INF> in the wavenumber range FFU<INF>m</INF> to 
FFL<INF>m</INF>. Follow the guidelines of section B.1.2 of this addendum 
for this band area calculation. Denote the result by BAV<INF>m</INF>.
    E.2.4 For each m and the associated i, calculate the RMSD of 
S<INF>3i</INF> between the absorbance values and their mean in the 
wavenumber range FFU<INF>m</INF> to FFL<INF>m</INF>. Denote the result 
by SRMS<INF>m</INF>.
    E.2.5 For each analytical region m, calculate FM<INF>m</INF> using 
equation E.1,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.023

    E.2.6 If only the m\th\ analytical region is used to calculate the 
concentration of the i\th\ analyte, set FRU<INF>i</INF> = 
FM<INF>m</INF>.
    E.2.7 If a number p<INF>i</INF> of analytical regions are used to 
calculate the concentration of the i\th\ analyte, set FRU<INF>i</INF> 
equal to the weighted mean of the appropriate FM<INF>m</INF> values 
calculated according to section E.2.5. Mathematically, if the set of 
analytical regions employed is {m'{time} , then FRU<INF>i</INF> is given 
by equation E.2,

where the W<INF>ik</INF> are calculated as described in appendix D of 
this addendum.

Appendix F of Addendum to Method 320--Determining Fractional Calibration 
                           Uncertainties (FCU)

                               F.1 General

    F.1.1 The concentrations yielded by the computerized analytical 
program applied to each single-compound reference spectrum are defined 
as the indicated standard concentrations (ISC's). The ISC values for a 
single compound spectrum should ideally equal the accepted standard 
concentration (ASC) for one analyte or interferant, and should ideally 
be zero for all other compounds. Variations from these results are 
caused by errors in the ASC values, variations from the Beer's law (or 
modified Beer's law) model used to determine the concentrations, and

[[Page 510]]

noise in the spectra. When the first two effects dominate, the 
systematic nature of the errors is often apparent and the analyst shall 
take steps to correct them.
    F.1.2 When the calibration error appears non-systematic, apply the 
procedures of sections F.2.1 through F.2.3 of this appendix to estimate 
the fractional calibration uncertainty (FCU) for each compound. The FCU 
is defined as the mean fractional error between the ASC and the ISC for 
all reference spectra with non-zero ASC for that compound. The FCU for 
each compound shall be less than the required fractional uncertainty 
specified in section 4.1 of this addendum.
    F.1.3 The computerized analytical programs shall also be required to 
yield acceptably low concentrations for compounds with ISC = 0 when 
applied to the reference spectra. The ISC of each reference spectrum for 
each analyte or interferant shall not exceed that compound's minimum 
measurement uncertainty (MAU or MIU).

                            F.2 Calculations

    F.2.1 Apply each analytical program to each reference spectrum. 
Prepare a similar table to that in Figure F.1 to present the ISC and ASC 
values for each analyte and interferant in each reference spectrum. 
Maintain the order of reference file names and compounds employed in 
preparing Figure F.1.
    F.2.2 For all reference spectra in Figure F.1, verify that the 
absolute values of the ISC's are less than the compound's MAU (for 
analytes) or MIU (for interferants).
    F.2.3 For each analyte reference spectrum, calculate the quantity 
(ASC-ISC)/ASC. For each analyte, calculate the mean of these values (the 
FCU<INF>i</INF> for the i\th\ analyte) over all reference spectra. 
Prepare a similar table to that in Figure F.2 to present the 
FCU<INF>i</INF> and analytical uncertainty limit (AU<INF>i</INF>) for 
each analyte.

      Appendix G to Addendum to Method 320--Measuring Noise Levels

                               G.1 General

    The root-mean-square (RMS) noise level is the standard measure of 
noise. The RMS noise level of a contiguous segment of a spectrum is the 
RMSD between the absorbance values that form the segment and the mean 
value of the segment (see appendix A of this addendum).

                            G.2 Calculations

    G.2.1 Evacuate the absorption cell or fill it with UPC grade 
nitrogen at approximately one atmosphere total pressure.
    G.2.2 Record two single beam spectra of signal integration period 
t<INF>SS</INF>.
    G.2.3 Form the double beam absorption spectrum from these two single 
beam spectra, and calculate the noise level RMS<INF>Sm</INF> in the M 
analytical regions.

  Appendix H of Addendum to Method 320--Determining Sample Absorption 
 Pathlength (L<INF>S</INF>) and Fractional Analytical Uncertainty (FAU)

                               H.1 General

    Reference spectra recorded at absorption pathlength (L<INF>R</INF>), 
gas pressure (P<INF>R</INF>), and gas absolute temperature 
(T<INF>R</INF>) may be used to determine analyte concentrations in 
samples whose spectra are recorded at conditions different from that of 
the reference spectra, i.e., at absorption pathlength (L<INF>S</INF>), 
absolute temperature (T<INF>S</INF>), and pressure (P<INF>S</INF>). This 
appendix describes the calculations for estimating the fractional 
uncertainty (FAU) of this practice. It also describes the calculations 
for determining the sample absorption pathlength from comparison of CTS 
spectra, and for preparing spectra for further instrumental and 
procedural checks.
    H.1.1 Before sampling, determine the sample absorption pathlength 
using least squares analysis. Determine the ratio L<INF>S</INF>/
L<INF>R</INF> by comparing the spectral sets {R1{time}  and {R3{time} , 
which are recorded using the same CTS at L<INF>S</INF> and 
L<INF>R</INF>, and T<INF>S</INF> and T<INF>R</INF>, but both at 
P<INF>R</INF>.
    H.1.2 Determine the fractional analysis uncertainty (FAU) for each 
analyte by comparing a scaled CTS spectral set, recorded at 
L<INF>S</INF>, T<INF>S</INF>, and P<INF>S</INF>, to the CTS reference 
spectra of the same gas, recorded at L<INF>R</INF>, T<INF>R</INF>, and 
P<INF>R</INF>. Perform the quantitative comparison after recording the 
sample spectra, based on band areas of the spectra in the CTS absorbance 
band associated with each analyte.

    H.2.1 Absorption Pathlength Determination. Perform and document 
separate linear baseline corrections to each analytical region in the 
spectral sets {R1{time}  and {R3{time} . Form a one-dimensional array 
A<INF>R</INF> containing the absorbance values from all segments of 
{R1{time}  that are associated with the analytical regions; the members 
of the array are A<INF>Ri</INF>, i = 1, n. Form a similar one-
dimensional array A<INF>S</INF> from the absorbance values in the 
spectral set {R3{time} ; the members of the array are A<INF>Si</INF>, i 
= 1, n. Based on the model A<INF>S</INF> = rA<INF>R</INF> + E, determine 
the least-squares estimate of r, the value of r which minimizes the 
square error E\2\. Calculate the sample absorption pathlength,

A<INF>R</INF> as described in section H.2.1 of this appendix, using 
values from {R1{time}  to form A<INF>R</INF>, and values from {R4{time}  
to form A<INF>S</INF>. Calculate NRMS<INF>E</INF> and IA<INF>AV</INF>

   Appendix I to Addendum to Method 320--Determining Fractional Model 
                           Uncertainties (FMU)

                               I.1 General

    To prepare analytical programs for FTIR analyses, the sample 
constituents must first be assumed. The calculations in this appendix, 
based upon a simulation of the sample spectrum, shall be used to verify 
the appropriateness of these assumptions. The simulated spectra consist 
of the sum of single compound reference spectra scaled to represent 
their contributions to the sample absorbance spectrum; scaling factors 
are based on the indicated standard concentrations (ISC) and measured 
(sample) analyte and interferant concentrations, the sample and 
reference absorption pathlengths, and the sample and reference gas 
pressures. No band-shape correction for differences in the temperature 
of the sample and reference spectra gases is made; such errors are 
included in the FMU estimate. The actual and simulated sample spectra 
are quantitatively compared to determine the fractional model 
uncertainty; this comparison uses the reference

[[Page 512]]

spectra band areas and residuals in the difference spectrum formed from 
the actual and simulated sample spectra.

                            I.2 Calculations

    I.2.1 For each analyte (with scaled concentration RSA<INF>i</INF>), 
select a reference spectrum SA<INF>i</INF> with indicated standard 
concentration ISC<INF>i</INF>. Calculate the scaling factors, 
RA<INF>i</INF>, using equation I.1,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.029

Form the spectra SAC<INF>i</INF> by scaling each SA<INF>i</INF> by the 
factor RA<INF>i</INF>.
    I.2.2 For each interferant, select a reference spectrum 
SI<INF>k</INF> with indicated standard concentration ISC<INF>k</INF>. 
Calculate the scaling factors, RI<INF>k</INF>, using equation I.2,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.030

Form the spectra SIC<INF>k</INF> by scaling each SI<INF>k</INF> by the 
factor RI<INF>k</INF>.
    I.2.3 For each analytical region, determine by visual inspection 
which of the spectra SAC<INF>i</INF> and SIC<INF>k</INF> exhibit 
absorbance bands within the analytical region. Subtract each spectrum 
SAC<INF>i</INF> and SIC<INF>k</INF> exhibiting absorbance from the 
sample spectrum S<INF>S</INF> to form the spectrum SUB<INF>S</INF>. To 
save analysis time and to avoid the introduction of unwanted noise into 
the subtracted spectrum, it is recommended that the calculation be made 
(1) only for those spectral data points within the analytical regions, 
and (2) for each analytical region separately using the original 
spectrum S<INF>S</INF>.
    I.2.4 For each analytical region m, calculate the RMSD of 
SUB<INF>S</INF> between the absorbance values and their mean in the 
region FFU<INF>m</INF> to FFL<INF>m</INF>. Denote the result by 
RMSS<INF>m</INF>.
    I.2.5 For each analyte i, calculate FM<INF>m</INF>, using equation 
I.3,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.031

for each analytical region associated with the analyte.
    I.2.6 If only the m\th\ analytical region is used to calculate the 
concentration of the i\th\ analyte, set FMU<INF>i</INF>=FM<INF>m</INF>.
    I.2.7 If a number of analytical regions are used to calculate the 
concentration of the i\th\ analyte, set FM<INF>i</INF> equal to the 
weighted mean of the appropriate FM<INF>m</INF> values calculated using 
equation I-3. Mathematically, if the set of analytical regions employed 
is {m'{time} , then the fractional model uncertainty, FMU, is given by 
equation I.4,

where W<INF>ik</INF> is calculated as described in appendix D of this 
addendum.

Appendix J of Addendum to Method 320--Determining Overall Concentration 
                           Uncertainties (OCU)

    The calculations in this addendum estimate the measurement 
uncertainties for various FTIR measurements. The lowest possible overall 
concentration uncertainty (OCU) for an analyte is its MAU value, which 
is an estimate of the absolute concentration uncertainty when spectral 
noise dominates the measurement error. However, if the product of the 
largest fractional concentration uncertainty (FRU, FCU, FAU, or FMU) and 
the measured concentration of an analyte exceeds the MAU for the 
analyte, then the OCU is this product. In mathematical terms, set 
OFU<INF>i</INF> = MAX{FRU<INF>i</INF>, FCU<INF>i</INF>, FAU<INF>i</INF>, 
FMU<INF>i</INF>{time}  and OCU<INF>i</INF> = 
MAX{RSA<INF>i</INF>*OFU<INF>i</INF>, MAU<INF>i</INF>{time} .

 Test Method 321--Measurement of Gaseous Hydrogen Chloride Emissions At 
 Portland Cement Kilns by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy

                            1.0 Introduction

    This method should be performed by those persons familiar with the 
operation of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) instrumentation in the 
application to source sampling. This document describes the sampling 
procedures for use in the application of FTIR spectrometry for the 
determination of vapor phase hydrogen chloride (HCl) concentrations both 
before and after particulate matter control devices installed at 
portland cement kilns. A procedure for analyte spiking is included for 
quality assurance. This method is considered to be self validating 
provided that the requirements listed in section 9 of this method are 
followed. The analytical procedures for interpreting infrared spectra 
from emission measurements are described in the ``Protocol For The Use 
of Extractive

[[Page 513]]

Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometry in Analyses of Gaseous 
Emissions From Stationary Industrial Sources'', included as an addendum 
to proposed Method 320 of this appendix (hereafter referred to as the 
``FTIR Protocol)''. References 1 and 2 describe the use of FTIR 
spectrometry in field measurements. Sample transport presents the 
principal difficulty in directly measuring HCl emissions. This identical 
problem must be overcome by any extractive measurement method. HCl is 
reactive and water soluble. The sampling system must be adequately 
designed to prevent sample condensation in the system.
    1.1 Scope and Application
    This method is specifically designed for the application of FTIR 
Spectrometry in extractive measurements of gaseous HCl concentrations in 
portland cement kiln emissions.

                            1.2 Applicability

    This method applies to the measurement of HCl [CAS No. 7647-01-0]. 
This method can be applied to the determination of HCl concentrations 
both before and after particulate matter control devices installed at 
portland cement manufacturing facilities. This method applies to either 
continuous flow through measurement (with isolated sample analysis) or 
grab sampling (batch analysis). HCl is measured using the mid-infrared 
spectral region for analysis (about 400 to 4000 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> or 25 to 
2.5 [micro]m). Table 1 lists the suggested analytical region for 
quantification of HCl taking the interference from water vapor into 
consideration.

    1.3 Method Range and Sensitivity
    1.3.1 The analytical range is determined by the instrumental design 
and the composition of the gas stream. For practical purposes there is 
no upper limit to the range because the pathlength may be reduced or the 
sample may be diluted. The lower detection range depends on (1) the 
absorption coefficient of the compound in the analytical frequency 
region, (2) the spectral resolution, (3) the interferometer sampling 
time, (4) the detector sensitivity and response, and (5) the absorption 
pathlength.
    1.3.2 The practical lower quantification range is usually higher 
than the instrument sensitivity allows and is dependent upon (1) the 
presence of interfering species in the exhaust gas including 
H<INF>2</INF>O, CO<INF>2</INF>, and SO<INF>2</INF>, (2) analyte losses 
in the sampling system, (3) the optical alignment of the gas cell and 
transfer optics, and (4) the quality of the reflective surfaces in the 
cell (cell throughput). Under typical test conditions (moisture content 
of up to 30% and CO<INF>2</INF> concentrations from 1 to 15 percent), a 
22 meter path length cell with a suitable sampling system may achieve a 
lower quantification range of from 1 to 5 ppm for HCl.
    1.4 Data Quality Objectives
    1.4.1 In designing or configuring the analytical system, data 
quality is determined by measuring of the root mean square deviation 
(RMSD) of the absorbance values within a chosen spectral (analytical) 
region. The RMSD provides an indication of the signal-to-noise ratio (S/
N) of the spectral baseline. Appendix D of the FTIR Protocol (the 
addendum to Method 320 of this appendix) presents a discussion of the 
relationship between the RMSD, lower detection limit, DL<INF>i</INF>, 
and analytical uncertainty, AU<INF>i</INF>. It is important to consider 
the target analyte quantification limit when performing testing with 
FTIR instrumentation, and to optimize the system to achieve the desired 
detection limit.
    1.4.2 Data quality is determined by measuring the root mean square 
(RMS) noise level in each analytical spectral region (appendix C of the 
FTIR Protocol). The RMS noise is defined as the root mean square 
deviation (RMSD) of the absorbance values in an analytical region from 
the mean absorbance value in the same region. Appendix D of the FTIR 
Protocol defines the minimum analyte uncertainty (MAU), and how the RMSD 
is used to calculate the MAU. The MAU<INF>im</INF> is the minimum 
concentration of the ith analyte in the mth analytical region for which 
the analytical uncertainty limit can be maintained. Table 2 presents 
example values of AU and MAU using the analytical region presented in 
Table 1.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 Principle
    See Method 320 of this appendix. HCl can also undergo rotation 
transitions by absorbing energy in the far-infrared spectral region. The 
rotational transitions are superimposed on the vibrational fundamental 
to give a series of lines centered at the fundamental vibrational 
frequency, 2885 cm-\1\. The frequencies of absorbance and the pattern of 
rotational/vibrational lines are unique to HCl. When this distinct 
pattern is observed in an infrared spectrum of an unknown sample, it 
unequivocally identifies HCl as a component of the mixture. The infrared 
spectrum of HCl is very distinctive and cannot be confused with the 
spectrum of any other compound. See Reference 6.
    2.2 Sampling and Analysis. See Method 320 of this appendix.
    2.3 Operator Requirements. The analyst must have knowledge of 
spectral patterns to choose an appropriate absorption path length or 
determine if sample dilution is necessary. The analyst should also 
understand FTIR instrument operation well enough to choose instrument 
settings that are consistent with the objectives of the analysis.

                             3.0 Definitions

    See appendix A of the FTIR Protocol.

                            4.0 Interferences

    This method will not measure HCl under conditions: (1) where the 
sample gas stream can condense in the sampling system or the 
instrumentation, or (2) where a high moisture content sample relative to 
the analyte concentrations imparts spectral interference due to the 
water vapor absorbance bands. For measuring HCl the first (sampling) 
consideration is more critical. Spectral interference from water vapor 
is not a significant problem except at very high moisture levels and low 
HCl concentrations.
    4.1 Analytical Interferences. See Method 320 of this appendix.
    4.1.1 Background Interferences. See Method 320 of this appendix.
    4.1.2 Spectral interferences. Water vapor can present spectral 
interference for FTIR gas analysis of HCl. Therefore, the water vapor in 
the spectra of kiln gas samples must be accounted for. This means 
preparing at least one spectrum of a water vapor sample where the 
moisture concentration is close to that in the kiln gas.
    4.2 Sampling System Interferences. The principal sampling system 
interferant for measuring HCl is water vapor. Steps must be taken to 
ensure that no condensation forms anywhere in the probe assembly, sample 
lines, or analytical instrumentation. Cold spots anywhere in the 
sampling system must be avoided. The extent of sampling system bias in 
the FTIR analysis of HCl depends on concentrations of potential 
interferants, moisture content of the gas stream, temperature of the gas 
stream, temperature of sampling system components, sample flow rate, and 
reactivity of HCl with other species in the gas stream (e.g., ammonia). 
For measuring HCl in a wet gas stream the temperatures of the gas 
stream, sampling components, and the sample flow rate are of primary 
importance. Analyte spiking with HCl is performed to demonstrate the 
integrity of the sampling system for transporting HCl vapor in the flue 
gas to the FTIR instrument. See section 9 of this method for a complete 
description of analyte spiking.

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 Hydrogen chloride vapor is corrosive and can cause irritation or 
severe damage to respiratory system, eyes and skin. Exposure to this 
compound should be avoided.
    5.2 This method may involve sampling at locations having high 
positive or negative pressures, or high concentrations of hazardous or 
toxic pollutants, and can not address all safety problems encountered 
under these diverse sampling conditions. It is the responsibility of the 
tester(s) to ensure proper safety and health practices, and to determine 
the applicability of regulatory limitations before performing this test 
method. Leak-check procedures are outlined in section 8.2 of Method 320 
of this appendix.

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

    Note: Mention of trade names or specific products does not 
constitute endorsement by the Environmental Protection Agency.

(interferometer, transfer optics, gas cell and detector) having the 
capability of measuring HCl to the predetermined minimum detectable 
level required (see section 4.1.3 of the FTIR Protocol). The system must 
also include an accurate means to control and/or measure the temperature 
of the FTIR gas analysis cell, and a personal computer with compatible 
software that provides real-time updates of the spectral profile during 
sample and spectral collection.

(133.3 Pascals) within two minutes (for batch sample analysis).

[[Page 515]]

    6.3 Mass Flow Meters/Controllers. To accurately measure analyte 
spike flow rate, having the appropriate calibrated range and a stated 
accuracy of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent of the absolute measurement 
value. This device must be calibrated with the major component of the 
calibration/spike gas (e.g., nitrogen) using an NIST traceable bubble 
meter or equivalent. Single point calibration checks should be performed 
daily in the field. When spiking HCl, the mass flow meter/controller 
should be thoroughly purged before and after introduction of the gas to 
prevent corrosion of the interior parts.
    6.4 Polytetrafluoroethane tubing. Diameter and length suitable to 
connect cylinder regulators.

Torr (133.3 Pa=1 Torr) within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent.
    6.8 Sampling Probe. Glass, stainless steel or other appropriate 
material of sufficient length and physical integrity to sustain heating, 
prevent adsorption of analytes and capable of reaching gas sampling 
point.
    6.9 Sampling Line. Heated 180 [deg]C (360 [deg]F) and fabricated of 
either stainless steel, polytetrafluoroethane or other material that 
prevents adsorption of HCl and transports effluent to analytical 
instrumentation. The extractive sample line must have the capability to 
transport sample gas to the analytical components as well as direct 
heated calibration spike gas to the calibration assembly located at the 
sample probe. It is important to minimize the length of heated sample 
line.
    6.10 Particulate Filters. A sintered stainless steel filter rated at 
20 microns or greater may be placed at the inlet of the probe (for 
removal of large particulate matter). A heated filter (Balston or 
equivalent) rated at 1 micron is necessary for primary particulate 
matter removal, and shall be placed immediately after the heated probe. 
The filter/filter holder temperature should be maintained at 180 [deg]C 
(360 [deg]F).
    6.11 Calibration/Analyte Spike Assembly. A heated three-way valve 
assembly (or equivalent) to introduce surrogate spikes into the sampling 
system at the outlet of the probe before the primary particulate filter.
    6.12 Sample Extraction Pump. A leak-free heated head pump (KNF 
Neuberger or equivalent) capable of extracting sample effluent through 
entire sampling system at a rate which prevents analyte losses and 
minimizes analyzer response time. The pump should have a heated by-pass 
and may be placed either before the FTIR instrument or after. If the 
sample pump is located upstream of the FTIR instrument, it must be 
fabricated from materials non-reactive to HCl. The sampling system and 
FTIR measurement system shall allow the operator to obtain at least six 
sample spectra during a one-hour period.

calibrations) to the analytical instrumentation;
    6.14.4 Delivery (optional) of a humidified nitrogen sample stream.
    6.15 Flow Measurement Device. Type S Pitot tube (or equivalent) and 
Magnahelic set for measurement of volumetric flow rate.

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards

    HCl can be purchased in a standard compressed gas cylinder. The most 
stable HCl cylinder mixture available has a concentration certified at 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent. Such a cylinder is suitable for 
performing analyte spiking because it will provide reproducible samples. 
The stability of the cylinder can be monitored over time by periodically 
performing direct FTIR analysis of cylinder samples. It is recommended 
that a 10-50 ppm cylinder of HCl be prepared having from 2-5 ppm SF6 as 
a tracer compound. (See sections 7.1 through 7.3 of Method 320 of this 
appendix for a complete description of the use of existing HCl reference 
spectra. See section 9.1 of Method 320 of this appendix for a complete 
discussion of standard concentration selection.)

             8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation and Storage

    See also Method 320 of this appendix.
    8.1 Pretest. A screening test is ideal for obtaining proper data 
that can be used for preparing analytical program files. Information 
from literature surveys and source personnel is also acceptable. 
Information about the sampling location and gas stream composition is 
required to determine the optimum sampling system configuration for 
measuring HCl. Determine the percent moisture of the kiln gas by Method 
4 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter or by performing a wet bulb/
dry bulb measurement. Perform a preliminary traverse of the sample duct 
or stack and select the sampling point(s). Acquire an initial spectrum 
and determine the optimum operational pathlength of the instrument.
    8.2 Leak-Check. See Method 320 of this appendix, section 8.2 for 
direction on performing leak-checks.

[[Page 516]]

    8.3 Background Spectrum. See Method 320 of this appendix, section 
8.5 for direction in background spectral acquisition.
    8.4 Pre-Test Calibration Transfer Standard (Direct Instrument 
Calibration). See Method 320 of this appendix, section 8.3 for direction 
in CTS spectral acquisition.
    8.5 Pre-Test System Calibration. See Method 320 of this appendix, 
sections 8.6.1 through 8.6.2 for direction in performing system 
calibration.
    8.6 Sampling
    8.6.1 Extractive System. An extractive system maintained at 180 
[deg]C (360 [deg]F) or higher which is capable of directing a total flow 
of at least 12 L/min to the sample cell is required (References 1 and 
2). Insert the probe into the duct or stack at a point representing the 
average volumetric flow rate and 25 percent of the cross sectional area. 
Co-locate an appropriate flow monitoring device with the sample probe so 
that the flow rate is recorded at specified time intervals during 
emission testing (e.g., differential pressure measurements taken every 
10 minutes during each run).
    8.6.2 Batch Samples. Evacuate the absorbance cell to 5 Torr (or 
less) absolute pressure before taking first sample. Fill the cell with 
kiln gas to ambient pressure and record the infrared spectrum, then 
evacuate the cell until there is no further evidence of infrared 
absorption. Repeat this procedure, collecting a total of six separate 
sample spectra within a 1-hour period.
    8.6.3 Continuous Flow Through Sampling. Purge the FTIR cell with 
kiln gas for a time period sufficient to equilibrate the entire sampling 
system and FTIR gas cell. The time required is a function of the 
mechanical response time of the system (determined by performing the 
system calibration with the CTS gas or equivalent), and by the chemical 
reactivity of the target analytes. If the effluent target analyte 
concentration is not variable, observation of the spectral up-date of 
the flowing gas sample should be performed until equilibration of the 
sample is achieved. Isolate the gas cell from the sample flow by 
directing the purge flow to vent. Record the spectrum and pressure of 
the sample gas. After spectral acquisition, allow the sample gas to 
purge the cell with at least three volumes of kiln gas. The time 
required to adequately purge the cell with the required volume of gas is 
a function of (1) cell volume, (2) flow rate through the cell, and (3) 
cell design. It is important that the gas introduction and vent for the 
FTIR cell provides a complete purge through the cell.
    8.6.4 Continuous Sampling. In some cases it is possible to collect 
spectra continuously while the FTIR cell is purged with sample gas. The 
sample integration time, t<INF>ss</INF>, the sample flow rate through 
the gas cell, and the sample integration time must be chosen so that the 
collected data consist of at least 10 spectra with each spectrum being 
of a separate cell volume of flue gas. Sampling in this manner may only 
be performed if the native source analyte concentrations do not affect 
the test results.
    8.7 Sample Conditioning
    8.7.1 High Moisture Sampling. Kiln gas emitted from wet process 
cement kilns may contain 3- to 40 percent moisture. Zinc selenide 
windows or the equivalent should be used when attempting to analyze hot/
wet kiln gas under these conditions to prevent dissolution of water 
soluble window materials (e.g., KBr).
    8.7.2 Sample Dilution. The sample may be diluted using an in-stack 
dilution probe, or an external dilution device provided that the sample 
is not diluted below the instrument's quantification range. As an 
alternative to using a dilution probe, nitrogen may be dynamically 
spiked into the effluent stream in the same manner as analyte spiking. A 
constant dilution rate shall be maintained throughout the measurement 
process. It is critical to measure and verify the exact dilution ratio 
when using a dilution probe or the nitrogen spiking approach. 
Calibrating the system with a calibration gas containing an appropriate 
tracer compound will allow determination of the dilution ratio for most 
measurement systems. The tester shall specify the procedures used to 
determine the dilution ratio, and include these calibration results in 
the report.
    8.8 Sampling QA, Data Storage and Reporting. See the FTIR Protocol. 
Sample integration times shall be sufficient to achieve the required 
signal-to-noise ratio, and all sample spectra should have unique file 
names. Two copies of sample interferograms and processed spectra will be 
stored on separate computer media. For each sample spectrum the analyst 
must document the sampling conditions, the sampling time (while the cell 
was being filled), the time the spectrum was recorded, the instrumental 
conditions (path length, temperature, pressure, resolution, integration 
time), and the spectral file name. A hard copy of these data must be 
maintained until the test results are accepted.
    8.9 Signal Transmittance. Monitor the signal transmittance through 
the instrumental system. If signal transmittance (relative to the 
background) drops below 95 percent in any spectral region where the 
sample does not absorb infrared energy, then a new background spectrum 
must be obtained.
    8.10 Post-test CTS. After the sampling run completion, record the 
CTS spectrum. Analysis of the spectral band area used for quantification 
from pre- and post-test CTS spectra should agree to within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent or corrective action must be taken.
    8.11 Post-test QA. The sample spectra shall be inspected immediately 
after the run to verify that the gas matrix composition was

[[Page 517]]

close to the assumed gas matrix, (this is necessary to account for the 
concentrations of the interferants for use in the analytical analysis 
programs), and to confirm that the sampling and instrumental parameters 
were appropriate for the conditions encountered.

                           9.0 Quality Control

    Use analyte spiking to verify the effectiveness of the sampling 
system for the target compounds in the actual kiln gas matrix. QA 
spiking shall be performed before and after each sample run. QA spiking 
shall be performed after the pre- and post-test CTS direct and system 
calibrations. The system biases calculated from the pre- and post-test 
dynamic analyte spiking shall be within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>30 percent 
for the spiked surrogate analytes for the measurements to be considered 
valid. See sections 9.3.1 through 9.3.2 for the requisite calculations. 
Measurement of the undiluted spike (direct-to-cell measurement) involves 
sending dry, spike gas to the FTIR cell, filling the cell to 1 
atmosphere and obtaining the spectrum of this sample. The direct-to-cell 
measurement should be performed before each analyte spike so that the 
recovery of the dynamically spiked analytes may be calculated. Analyte 
spiking is only effective for assessing the integrity of the sampling 
system when the concentration of HCl in the source does not vary 
substantially. Any attempt to quantify an analyte recovery in a variable 
concentration matrix will result in errors in the expected concentration 
of the spiked sample. If the kiln gas target analyte concentrations vary 
by more than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent (or 5 ppm, whichever is 
greater) in the time required to acquire a sample spectrum, it may be 
necessary to: (1) Use a dual sample probe approach, (2) use two 
independent FTIR measurement systems, (3) use alternate QA/QC 
procedures, or (4) postpone testing until stable emission concentrations 
are achieved. (See section 9.2.3 of this method). It is recommended that 
a laboratory evaluation be performed before attempting to employ this 
method under actual field conditions. The laboratory evaluation shall 
include (1) performance of all applicable calculations in section 4 of 
the FTIR Protocol; (2) simulated analyte spiking experiments in dry 
(ambient) and humidified sample matrices using HCl; and (3) performance 
of bias (recovery) calculations from analyte spiking experiments. It is 
not necessary to perform a laboratory evaluation before every field 
test. The purpose of the laboratory study is to demonstrate that the 
actual instrument and sampling system configuration used in field 
testing meets the requirements set forth in this method.
    9.1 Spike Materials. Perform analyte spiking with an HCl standard to 
demonstrate the integrity of the sampling system.
    9.1.1 An HCl standard of approximately 50 ppm in a balance of ultra 
pure nitrogen is recommended. The SF<INF>6</INF> (tracer) concentration 
shall be 2 to 5 ppm depending upon the measurement pathlength. The spike 
ratio (spike flow/total flow) shall be no greater than 1:10, and an 
ideal spike concentration should approximate the native effluent 
concentration.
    9.1.2 The ideal spike concentration may not be achieved because the 
target concentration cannot be accurately predicted prior to the field 
test, and limited calibration standards will be available during 
testing. Therefore, practical constraints must be applied that allow the 
tester to spike at an anticipated concentration. For these tests, the 
analyte concentration contributed by the HCl standard spike should be 1 
to 5 ppm or should more closely approximate the native concentration if 
it is greater.
    9.2 Spike Procedure
    9.2.1 A spiking/sampling apparatus is shown in Figure 2. Introduce 
the spike/tracer gas mixture at a constant flow (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 
percent) rate at approximately 10 percent of the total sample flow. (For 
example, introduce the surrogate spike at 1 L/min 20 cc/min, into a 
total sample flow rate of 10 L/min). The spike must be pre-heated before 
introduction into the sample matrix to prevent a localized condensation 
of the gas stream at the spike introduction point. A heated sample 
transport line(s) containing multiple transport tubes within the heated 
bundle may be used to spike gas up through the sampling system to the 
spike introduction point. Use a calibrated flow device (e.g., mass flow 
meter/controller), to monitor the spike flow as indicated by a 
calibrated flow meter or controller, or alternately, the SF<INF>6</INF> 
tracer ratio may be calculated from the direct measurement and the 
diluted measurement. It is often desirable to use the tracer approach in 
calculating the spike/total flow ratio because of the difficulty in 
accurately measuring hot/wet total flow. The tracer technique has been 
successfully used in past validation efforts (Reference 1).
    9.2.2 Perform a direct-to-cell measurement of the dry, undiluted 
spike gas. Introduce the spike directly to the FTIR cell, bypassing the 
sampling system. Fill cell to 1 atmosphere and collect the spectrum of 
this sample. Ensure that the spike gas has equilibrated to the 
temperature of the measurement cell before acquisition of the spectra. 
Inspect the spectrum and verify that the gas is dry and contains 
negligible CO<INF>2</INF>. Repeat the process to obtain a second direct-
to-cell measurement. Analysis of spectral band areas for HCl from these 
duplicate measurements should agree to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 
percent of the mean.
    9.2.3 Analyte Spiking. Determine whether the kiln gas contains 
native concentrations

[[Page 518]]

of HCl by examination of preliminary spectra. Determine whether the 
concentration varies significantly with time by observing a continuously 
up-dated spectrum of sample gas in the flow-through sampling mode. If 
the concentration varies by more than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent 
during the period of time required to acquire a spectra, then an 
alternate approach should be used. One alternate approach uses two 
sampling lines to convey sample to the gas distribution manifold. One of 
the sample lines is used to continuously extract unspiked kiln gas from 
the source. The other sample line serves as the analyte spike line. One 
FTIR system can be used in this arrangement. Spiked or unspiked sample 
gas may be directed to the FTIR system from the gas distribution 
manifold, with the need to purge only the components between the 
manifold and the FTIR system. This approach minimizes the time required 
to acquire an equilibrated sample of spiked or unspiked kiln gas. If the 
source varies by more than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent (or 5 ppm, 
whichever is greater) in the time it takes to switch from the unspiked 
sample line to the spiked sample line, then analyte spiking may not be a 
feasible means to determine the effectiveness of the sampling system for 
the HCl in the sample matrix. A second alternative is to use two 
completely independent FTIR measurement systems. One system would 
measure unspiked samples while the other system would measure the spiked 
samples. As a last option, (where no other alternatives can be used) a 
humidified nitrogen stream may be generated in the field which 
approximates the moisture content of the kiln gas. Analyte spiking into 
this humidified stream can be employed to assure that the sampling 
system is adequate for transporting the HCl to the FTIR instrumentation.
    9.2.3.1 Adjust the spike flow rate to approximately 10 percent of 
the total flow by metering spike gas through a calibrated mass flowmeter 
or controller. Allow spike flow to equilibrate within the sampling 
system before analyzing the first spiked kiln gas samples. A minimum of 
two consecutive spikes are required. Analysis of the spectral band area 
used for quantification should agree to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 
percent or corrective action must be taken.
    9.2.3.2 After QA spiking is completed, the sampling system 
components shall be purged with nitrogen or dry air to eliminate traces 
of the HCl compound from the sampling system components. Acquire a 
sample spectra of the nitrogen purge to verify the absence of the 
calibration mixture.
    9.2.3.3 Analyte spiking procedures must be carefully executed to 
ensure that meaningful measurements are achieved. The requirements of 
sections 9.2.3.3.1 through 9.2.3.3.4 shall be met.
    9.2.3.3.1 The spike must be in the vapor phase, dry, and heated to 
(or above) the kiln gas temperature before it is introduced to the kiln 
gas stream.
    9.2.3.3.2 The spike flow rate must be constant and accurately 
measured.
    9.2.3.3.3 The total flow must also be measured continuously and 
reliably or the dilution ratio must otherwise be verified before and 
after a run by introducing a spike of a non-reactive, stable compound 
(i.e., tracer).
    9.2.3.3.4 The tracer must be inert to the sampling system 
components, not contained in the effluent gas, and readily detected by 
the analytical instrumentation. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF<INF>6</INF>) has 
been used successfully (References 1 and 2) for this purpose.

    9.3.1 Recovery. Calculate the percent recovery of the spiked 
analytes using equations 1 and 2.

S<INF>m</INF> = Mean concentration of the analyte spiked effluent 
samples (observed).

(theoretical).

spike flow plus effluent flow.
C<INF>s</INF> = cylinder concentration of spike gas.
S<INF>u</INF> = native concentration of analytes in unspiked samples.

The spike dilution factor may be confirmed by measuring the total flow 
and the spike flow directly. Alternately, the spike dilution can be 
verified by comparing the concentration of the tracer compound in the 
spiked samples (diluted) to the tracer concentration in the direct 
(undiluted) measurement of the spike gas.

concentration measured in a spiked sample.
[SF<INF>6</INF>]<INF>direct</INF> = the SF<INF>6</INF> concentration 
measured directly.

    9.3.2 Bias. The bias may be determined by the difference between the 
observed spike value and the expected response (i.e., the equivalent 
concentration of the spiked material plus the analyte concentration 
adjusted for spike dilution). Bias is defined by section 6.3.1 of EPA 
Method 301 of this appendix (Reference 8) as,

Acceptable recoveries for analyte spiking are <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>30 
percent. Application of correction factors to the data based upon bias 
and recovery calculations is subject to the approval of the 
Administrator.

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    10.1 Calibration transfer standards (CTS). The EPA Traceability 
Protocol gases or NIST traceable standards, with a minimum accuracy of 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent shall be used. For other requirements of 
the CTS, see the FTIR Protocol section 4.5.
    10.2 Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N). The S/N shall be less than the 
minimum acceptable measurement uncertainty in the analytical regions to 
be used for measuring HCl.
    10.3 Absorbance Pathlength. Verify the absorbance path length by 
comparing CTS spectra to reference spectra of the calibration gas(es).
    10.4 Instrument Resolution. Measure the line width of appropriate 
CTS band(s) to verify instrumental resolution.
    10.5 Apodization Function. Choose the appropriate apodization 
function. Determine any appropriate mathematical transformations that 
are required to correct instrumental errors by measuring the CTS. Any 
mathematical transformations must be documented and reproducible. 
Reference 9 provides additional information about FTIR instrumentation.

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    A full description of the analytical procedures is given in sections 
4.6-4.11, sections 5, 6, and 7, and the appendices of the FTIR Protocol. 
Additional description of quantitative spectral analysis is provided in 
References 10 and 11.

                   12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

    Data analysis is performed using appropriate reference spectra whose 
concentrations can be verified using CTS spectra. Various analytical 
programs (References 10 and 11) are available to relate sample 
absorbance to a concentration standard. Calculated concentrations should 
be verified by analyzing spectral baselines after mathematically 
subtracting scaled reference spectra from the sample spectra. A full 
description of the data analysis and calculations may be found in the 
FTIR Protocol (sections 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 and appendices).
    12.1 Calculated concentrations in sample spectra are corrected for 
differences in absorption pathlength between the reference and sample 
spectra by

were recorded.

    12.2 The temperature correction in equation 5 is a volumetric 
correction. It does not account for temperature dependence of 
rotational-vibrational relative line intensities. Whenever possible, the 
reference spectra used in the analysis should be collected at a 
temperature near the temperature of the FTIR cell used in the test to 
minimize the calculated error in the measurement (FTIR Protocol, 
appendix D). Additionally, the analytical region chosen for the analysis 
should be sufficiently broad to minimize errors caused by small 
differences in relative line intensities between reference spectra and 
the sample spectra.

                         13.0 Method Performance

    A description of the method performance may be found in the FTIR 
Protocol. This method is self validating provided the results meet the 
performance specification of the QA spike in sections 9.0 through 9.3 of 
this method.

 Sec. Appendix C to Part 63--Determination of the Fraction Biodegraded 
            (F<INF>bio</INF>) in a Biological Treatment Unit

                               I. Purpose

    The purpose of this appendix is to define the procedures for an 
owner or operator to use to calculate the site specific fraction of 
organic compounds biodegraded (F<INF>bio</INF>) in a biological 
treatment unit. If an acceptable level of organic compounds is destroyed 
rather than emitted to the air or remaining in the effluent, the 
biological treatment unit may be used to comply with the applicable 
treatment requirements without the unit being covered and vented through 
a closed vent system to an air pollution control device.
    The determination of F<INF>bio</INF> shall be made on a system as it 
would exist under the rule. The owner or operator should anticipate 
changes that would occur to the wastewater flow and concentration of 
organics, to be treated by the biological treatment unit, as a result of 
enclosing the collection and treatment system as required by the rule.
    Unless otherwise specified, the procedures presented in this 
appendix are designed to be applied to thoroughly mixed treatment units. 
A thoroughly mixed treatment unit is a unit that is designed and 
operated to approach or achieve uniform biomass distribution and organic 
compound concentration throughout the aeration unit by quickly 
dispersing the recycled biomass and the wastewater entering the unit. 
Detailed discussion on how to determine if a biological treatment unit 
is thoroughly mixed can be found in reference 7. Systems that are not 
thoroughly mixed treatment units should be subdivided into a series of 
zones that have uniform characteristics within each zone. The number of 
zones required to characterize a biological treatment system will depend 
on the design and operation of the treatment system. Detailed discussion 
on how to determine the number of zones in a biological treatment unit 
and examples of determination of f <INF>bio</INF> can be found in 
reference 8. Each zone should then be modeled as a separate unit. The 
amount of air emissions and biodegradation from the modeling of these 
separate zones can then be added to reflect the entire system.

                             II. Definitions

    Biological treatment unit = wastewater treatment unit designed and 
operated to promote the growth of bacteria to destroy organic materials 
in wastewater.

f<INF>bio</INF> = The fraction of individual applicable organic 
compounds in the wastewater biodegraded in a biological treatment unit.
F<INF>bio</INF> = The fraction of total applicable organic compounds in 
the wastewater biodegraded in a biological treatment unit.
Fe = The fraction of applicable organic compounds emitted from the 
wastewater to the atmosphere.
K1 = First order biodegradation rate constant, L/g MLVSS-hr
KL = liquid-phase mass transfer coefficient, m/s
M = compound specific mass flow weighted average of organic compounds in 
the wastewater, Mg/Yr

          III. Procedures for Determination of f<INF>bio</INF>

    The first step in the analysis to determine if a biological 
treatment unit may be used without being covered and vented through a 
closed-vent system to an air pollution control device is to determine 
the compound-specific f<INF>bio</INF>. The following procedures may be 
used to determine f<INF>bio</INF>:
    (1) The EPA Test Method 304A or 304B (appendix A, part 63)--Method 
for the Determination of Biodegradation Rates of Organic Compounds,
    (2) Performance data with and without biodegradation,
    (3) Inlet and outlet concentration measurements,
    (4) Batch tests,
    (5) Multiple zone concentration measurements.
    All procedures must be executed so that the resulting 
f<INF>bio</INF> is based on the collection system and waste management 
units being

[[Page 524]]

in compliance with the rule. If the collection system and waste 
management units meet the suppression requirements at the time of the 
test, any of the procedures may be chosen. If the collection system and 
waste management units are not in compliance at the time of the 
performance test, then only Method 304A, B, or the batch test shall be 
chosen. If Method 304A, B, or the batch test is used, any anticipated 
changes to the influent of the full-scale biological treatment unit that 
will occur after the facility has enclosed the collection system must be 
represented in the influent feed to the benchtop bioreactor unit, or 
test unit.
    Select one or more appropriate procedures from the five listed above 
based on the availability of site specific data and the type of mixing 
that occurs in the unit (thoroughly mixed or multiple mixing zone). If 
the facility does not have site-specific data on the removal efficiency 
of its biological treatment unit, then Procedure 1 or Procedure 4 may be 
used. Procedure 1 allows the use of a benchtop bioreactor to determine 
the first-order biodegradation rate constant. An owner or operator may 
elect to assume the first order biodegradation rate constant is zero for 
any regulated compound(s) present in the wastewater. Procedure 4 
explains two types of batch tests which may be used to estimate the 
first order biodegradation rate constant. An owner or operator may elect 
to assume the first order biodegradation rate constant is zero for any 
regulated compound(s) present in the wastewater. Procedure 3 would be 
used if the facility has, or measures to determine, data on the inlet 
and outlet individual organic compound concentration for the biological 
treatment unit. Procedure 3 may only be used on a thoroughly mixed 
treatment unit. Procedure 5 is the concentration measurement test that 
can be used for units with multiple mixing zones. Procedure 2 is used if 
a facility has or obtains performance data on a biotreatment unit prior 
to and after addition of the microbial mass. An example where Procedure 
2 could be used is an activated sludge unit where measurements have been 
taken on inlet and exit concentration of organic compounds in the 
wastewater prior to seeding with the microbial mass and startup of the 
unit. The flow chart in figure 1 outlines the steps to use for each of 
the procedures.

                  A. Method 304A or 304B (Procedure 1)

    If the first procedure is selected, follow the instructions in 
appendix A of part 63 Method 304A ``Method for the Determination of 
Biodegradation Rates of Organic Compounds (Vented Option)'' or Method 
304B ``Method for the Determination of Biodegradation Rates of Organic 
Compounds (Scrubber Option).'' Method 304A or 304B provides instruction 
on setting up and operating a self-contained benchtop bioreactor system 
which is operated under conditions representative of the target full-
scale system. Method 304A uses a benchtop bioreactor system with a vent, 
and uses modeling to estimate any air emissions. Method 304B uses a 
benchtop bioreactor system which is equipped with a scrubber and is not 
vented.
    There are some restrictions on which method a source may use. If the 
facility is measuring the rate of biodegradation of compounds that may 
tend to react or hydrolyze in the scrubber of Method 304B, this method 
shall not be used and Method 304A is the required method. If a Henry's 
law value is not available to use with Form V, then Method 304A shall 
not be used and Method 304B is the required method. When using either 
method, the feed flow to the benchtop bioreactor shall be representative 
of the flow and concentration of the wastewater that will be treated by 
the full-scale biological treatment unit after the collection and 
treatment system has been enclosed as required under the applicable 
subpart.
    The conditions under which the full-scale biological treatment unit 
is run establish the operating parameters of Method 304A or 304B. If the 
biological treatment unit is operated under abnormal operating 
conditions (conditions outside the range of critical parameters examined 
and confirmed in the laboratory), the EPA believes this will adversely 
affect the biodegradation rate and is an unacceptable treatment option. 
The facility would be making multiple runs of the test method to 
simulate the operating range for its biological treatment unit. For wide 
ranges of variation in operating parameters, the facility shall 
demonstrate the biological treatment unit is achieving an acceptable 
level of control, as required by the regulation, across the ranges and 
not only at the endpoints.
    If Method 304A is used, complete Form V initially. Form V is used to 
calculate K1 from the Method 304A results. Form V uses the Henry's law 
constant to estimate the fraction lost from the benchtop reactor vent. 
The owner or operator shall use the Henry's law values in Table I. Form 
V also gives direction for calculating an equivalent KL. Note on Form V 
if the calculated number for line 11 is greater than the calculated 
value for line 13, this procedure shall not be used to demonstrate the 
compound is biodegradable. If line 11 is greater than line 13, this is 
an indication the fraction emitted from the vent is greater than the 
fraction biodegraded. The equivalent KL determined on Form V is used in 
Form II (line 6). Estimation of the Fe and f<INF>bio</INF> must be done 
following the steps in Form III. Form III uses the previously calculated 
values of K1 and KL (equivalent KL), and site-specific parameters of the 
full-scale bioreactor as input to the calculations. Forms II, III, and V 
must

[[Page 525]]

be completed for each organic compound in the wastewater to determine Fe 
and f<INF>bio</INF>.
    If Method 304B is used, perform the method and use the measurements 
to determine K1, which is the first-order biodegradation rate constant. 
Form I lists the sequence of steps in the procedure for calculating K1 
from the Method 304B results. Once K1 is determined, KL must be 
calculated by use of mass transfer equations. Form II outlines the 
procedure to follow for use of mass transfer equations to determine KL. 
A computer program which incorporates these mass transfer equations may 
be used. Water7 is a program that incorporates these mass transfer 
equations and may be used to determine KL. Refer to Form II-A to 
determine KL, if Water7 or the most recent update to this model is used. 
In addition, the Bay Area Sewage Toxics Emission (BASTE) model version 
3.0 or equivalent upgrade and the TOXCHEM (Environment Canada's 
Wastewater Technology Centre and Environmega, Ltd.) model version 1.10 
or equivalent upgrade may also be used to determine KL for the 
biological treatment unit with several stipulations. The programs must 
be altered to output a KL value which is based on the site-specific 
parameters of the unit modeled, and the Henry's law values listed in 
Table I must be substituted for the existing Henry's law values in the 
programs. Input values used in the model and corresponding output values 
shall become documentation of the f<INF>bio</INF> determination. The 
owner or operator should be aware these programs do not allow modeling 
of certain units. To model these units, the owner or operator shall use 
one of the other appropriate procedures as outlined in this appendix. 
The owner or operator shall not use a default value for KL. The KL value 
determined by use of these models shall be based on the site-specific 
parameters of the specific unit. This KL value shall be inserted in Form 
II (line 6). Estimation of the Fe and f<INF>bio</INF> must be done 
following the steps in Form III. Form III uses the previously calculated 
values of K1 and KL, and site-specific parameters of the full-scale 
bioreactor as input to the calculations. Forms I, II, and III must be 
completed for each organic compound in the wastewater to determine Fe 
and f<INF>bio</INF>.

    B. Performance Data With and Without Biodegradation (Procedure 2)

    Procedure 2 uses site-specific performance data that represents or 
characterizes operation of the unit both with and without 
biodegradation. As previously mentioned, proper determination of 
f<INF>bio</INF> must be made on a system as it would exist under the 
rule. Using Form IV, calculate KL and K1. After KL and K1 are 
determined, Form III is used to calculate Fe and f<INF>bio</INF> for 
each organic compound present in the wastewater.

      C. Inlet and Outlet Concentration Measurements (Procedure 3)

    Procedure 3 uses measured inlet and outlet organic compound 
concentrations for the unit. This procedure may only be used on a 
thoroughly mixed treatment unit. Again, proper determination of 
f<INF>bio</INF> must be made on a system as it would exist under the 
rule. The first step in using this procedure is to calculate KL using 
Form II. A computer model may be used. If the Water7 model or the most 
recent update to this model is used, then use Form II-A to calculate KL. 
After KL is determined using field data, complete Form VI to calculate 
K1. The TOXCHEM or BASTE model may also be used to calculate KL for the 
biological treatment unit, with the stipulations listed in procedure 
304B. After KL and K1 are determined, Form III is used to calculate Fe 
and f<INF>bio</INF> for each organic compound.

                      D. Batch Tests (Procedure 4)

    Two types of batch tests which may be used to determine kinetic 
parameters are: (1) The aerated reactor test and (2) the sealed reactor 
test. The aerated reactor test is also known as the BOX test (batch test 
with oxygen addition). The sealed reactor test is also known as the 
serum bottle test. These batch tests should be conducted only by persons 
familiar with procedures for determining biodegradation kinetics. 
Detailed discussions of batch procedures for determining biodegradation 
kinetic parameters can be found in references 1-4.
    For both batch test approaches, a biomass sample from the activated 
sludge unit of interest is collected, aerated, and stored for no more 
than 4 hours prior to testing. To collect sufficient data when 
biodegradation is rapid, it may be necessary to dilute the biomass 
sample. If the sample is to be diluted, the biomass sample shall be 
diluted using treated effluent from the activated sludge unit of 
interest to a concentration such that the biodegradation test will last 
long enough to make at least six concentration measurements. It is 
recommended that the tests not be terminated until the compound 
concentration falls below the limit of quantitation (LOQ). Measurements 
that are below the LOQ should not be used in the data analysis. Biomass 
concentrations shall be determined using standard methods for 
measurement of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) (reference 
5).
    The change in concentration of a test compound may be monitored by 
either measuring the concentration in the liquid or in the reactor 
headspace. The analytical technique chosen for the test should be as 
sensitive as possible. For the batch test procedures described in this 
section, equilibrium conditions must exist between the liquid and gas 
phases of the experiments because the

[[Page 526]]

data analysis procedures are based on this premise. To use the headspace 
sampling approach, the reactor headspace must be in equilibrium with the 
liquid so that the headspace concentrations can be correlated with the 
liquid concentrations. Before the biodegradation testing is conducted, 
the equilibrium assumption must be verified. A discussion of the 
equilibrium assumption verification is given below in sections D.1 and 
D.2 since different approaches are required for the two types of batch 
tests.
    To determine biodegradation kinetic parameters in a batch test, it 
is important to choose an appropriate initial substrate (compound(s) of 
interest) concentration for the test. The outcome of the batch 
experiment may be influenced by the initial substrate (S<INF>O</INF>) to 
biomass (X<INF>O</INF>) ratio (see references 3, 4, and 6). This ratio 
is typically measured in chemical oxygen demand (COD) units. When the 
S<INF>O</INF>/X<INF>O</INF> ratio is low, cell multiplication and growth 
in the batch test is negligible and the kinetics measured by the test 
are representative of the kinetics in the activated sludge unit of 
interest. The S<INF>O</INF>/X<INF>O</INF> ratio for a batch test is 
determined with the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.034

Where:

S<INF>O</INF>/X<INF>O</INF>=initial substrate to biomass ratio on a COD 
basis
S<INF>i</INF>=initial substrate concentration in COD units (g COD/L)
X=biomass concentration in the batch test (g MLVSS/L)
1.42 = Conversion factor to convert to COD units

    For the batch tests described in this section, the S<INF>O</INF>/
X<INF>O</INF> ratio (on a COD basis) must be initially less than 0.5.
    1. Aerated Reactor Test. An aerated draft tube reactor may be used 
for the biokinetics testing (as an example see Figure 2 of appendix C). 
Other aerated reactor configurations may also be used. Air is bubbled 
through a porous frit at a rate sufficient to aerate and keep the 
reactor uniformly mixed. Aeration rates typically vary from 50 to 200 
ml/min for a 1 liter system. A mass flow rate controller is used to 
carefully control the air flow rate because it is important to have an 
accurate measure of this rate. The dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration 
in the system must not fall below 2 mg/liter so that the biodegradation 
observed will not be DO-limited. Once the air flow rate is established, 
the test mixture (or compound) of interest is then injected into the 
reactor and the concentration of the compound(s) is monitored over time. 
Concentrations may be monitored in the liquid or in the headspace. A 
minimum of six samples shall be taken over the period of the test. 
However, it is necessary to collect samples until the compound 
concentration falls below the LOQ. If liquid samples are collected, they 
must be small enough such that the liquid volume in the batch reactor 
does not change by more than 10%.
    Before conducting experiments with biomass, it is necessary to 
verify the equilibrium assumption. The equilibrium assumption can be 
verified by conducting a stripping experiment using the effluent (no 
biomass) from the activated sludge unit of interest. Effluent is 
filtered with a 0.45 um or smaller filter and placed in the draft tube 
reactor. Air is sparged into the system and the compound concentration 
in the liquid or headspace is monitored over time. This test with no 
biomass may provide an estimate of the Henry's law constant. If the 
system is at equilibrium, the Henry's law constant may be estimated with 
the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.035

Where:

C=cencentration at time, t (min)
C<INF>O</INF>=concentration at t=0
G=volumetric gas flow rate (ml/min)
V=liquid volume in the batch reactor (ml)
K<INF>eq</INF>=Henry's law constant (mg/L-gas)/(mg/L-liquid)
t=time (min)

    A plot of--ln(C/C<INF>o</INF>) as a function of t will have a slope 
equal to GK<INF>eq</INF>/V. The equilibrium assumption can be verified 
by comparing the experimentally determined K<INF>eq</INF> for the system 
to literature values of the Henry's Law constant (including those listed 
in this appendix). If K<INF>eq</INF> does not match the Henry's law 
constant, K<INF>eq</INF> shall be determined from analysis of the 
headspace and liquid concentration in a batch system.
    The concentration of a compound decreases in the bioreactor due to 
both biodegradation and stripping. Biodegradation processes are 
typically described with a Monod model. This model and a stripping 
expression are combined to give a mass balance for the aerated draft 
tube reactor ):

[[Page 527]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.036

Where:

s=test compound concentration, mg/liter
G=volumetric gas flow rate, liters/hr
K<INF>eq</INF>=Henry's Law constant measured in the system, (mg/liter 
gas)/(mg/liter liquid)
V=volume of liquid in the reactor, liters
X=biomass concentration (g MLVSS/liter)
Q<INF>m</INF>=maximum rate of substrate removal, mg/g MLVSS/hr
K<INF>S</INF>=Monod biorate constant at half the maximum rate, mg/liter

    Equation App. C-3 can be integrated to obtain the following 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR22JA01.162

Where:

A=GK<INF>eq</INF>K<INF>s</INF> + Q<INF>m</INF>VX
B=GK<INF>eq</INF>
S<INF>o</INF>=test compound concentration at t=0
    This equation is used along with the substrate concentration versus 
time data to determine the best fit parameters (Q<INF>m</INF> and 
K<INF>S</INF>) to describe the biodegradation process in the aerated 
reactor. If the aerated reactor test is used, the following procedure is 
used to analyze the data. Evaluate K<INF>eq</INF> for the compound of 
interest with Form XI. The concentration in the vented headspace or 
liquid is measured as a function of time and the data is entered on Form 
XI. A plot is made from the data and attached to the Form XI. 
K<INF>eq</INF> is calculated on Form XI and the results are contrasted 
with the expected value of Henry's law obtained from Form IX. If the 
comparison is satisfactory, the stripping constant is calculated from 
K<INF>eq</INF>, completing Form XI. The values of K<INF>eq</INF> may 
differ because the theoretical value of K<INF>eq</INF> may not be 
applicable to the system of interest. If the comparison of the 
calculated K<INF>eq</INF> from the form and the expected value of 
Henry's law is unsatisfactory, Form X can alternatively be used to 
validate K<INF>eq</INF>. If the aerated reactor is demonstrated to not 
be at equilibrium, either modify the reactor design and/or operation, or 
use another type of batch test.
    The compound-specific biorate constants are then measured using Form 
XII. The stripping constant that was determined from Form XI and a 
headspace correction factor of 1 are entered on Form XII. The aerated 
reactor biotest may then be run, measuring concentrations of each 
compound of interest as a function of time. If headspace concentrations 
are measured instead of liquid concentrations, then the corresponding 
liquid concentrations are calculated from the headspace measurements 
using the K<INF>eq</INF> determined on Form XI and entered on Form XII.
    The concentration data on Form XII may contain scatter that can 
adversely influence the data interpretation. It is possible to curve fit 
the concentration data and enter the concentrations on the fitted curve 
instead of the actual data. If curve fitting is used, the curve-fitting 
procedure must be based upon the Equation App. C-4. When curve fitting 
is used, it is necessary to attach a plot of the actual data and the 
fitted curve to Form XII.
    If the stripping rate constant is relatively large when compared to 
the biorate at low concentrations, it may be difficult to obtain 
accurate evaluations of the first-order biorate constant. In these 
cases, either reducing the stripping rate constant by lowering the 
aeration rate, or increasing the biomass concentrations should be 
considered.
    The final result of the batch testing is the measurement of a 
biorate that can be used to estimate the fraction biodegraded, 
f<INF>bio</INF>. The number transferred to Form III is obtained from 
Form XII, line 9.
    2. Sealed Reactor Test. This test uses a closed system to prevent 
losses of the test compound by volatilization. This test may be 
conducted using a serum bottle or a sealed draft tube reactor (for an 
example see Figure 3 of appendix C). Since no air is supplied, it is 
necessary to ensure that sufficient oxygen is present in the system. The 
DO concentration in the system must not fall below 2 mg/liter so that 
the biodegradation observed will not be DO-limited. As an alternative, 
oxygen may be supplied by electrolysis as needed to maintain the DO 
concentration above 2 mg/liter. The reactor contents must be uniformly 
mixed, by stirring

[[Page 528]]

or agitation using a shaker or similar apparatus. The test mixture (or 
compound) of interest is injected into the reactor and the concentration 
is monitored over time. A minimum of six samples shall be taken over the 
period of the test. However, it is necessary to monitor the 
concentration until it falls below the LOQ.
    The equilibrium assumption must be verified for the batch reactor 
system. In this case, K<INF>eq</INF> may be determined by simultaneously 
measuring gas and liquid phase concentrations at different times within 
a given experiment. A constant ratio of gas/liquid concentrations 
indicates that equilibrium conditions are present and K<INF>eq</INF> is 
not a function of concentration. This ratio is then taken as the 
K<INF>eq</INF> for the specific compound in the test. It is not 
necessary to measure K<INF>eq</INF> for each experiment. If the ratio is 
not constant, the equilibrium assumption is not valid and it is 
necessary to (1) increase mixing energy for the system and retest for 
the equilibrium assumption, or (2) use a different type of test (for 
example, a collapsible volume reactor).
    The concentration of a compound decreases in the bioreactor due to 
biodegradation according to Equation App. C-5:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.038

Where:

s=test compound concentration (mg/liters)
V<INF>l</INF>=the average liquid volume in the reactor (liters)
V<INF>g</INF>=the average gas volume in the reactor (liters)
Q<INF>m</INF>=maximum rate of substrate removal (mg/g ML VSS/hr)
K<INF>eq</INF>=Henry's Law constant determined for the test, (mg/liter 
gas)/(mg/liter liquid)
K<INF>s</INF>=Monod biorate constant at one-half the maximum rate (mg/
liter)
t=time (hours)
X=biomass concentration (g ML VSS/liter )
s<INF>o</INF>=test compound concentration at time t=0

    Equation App. C-5 can be solved analytically to give:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR22JA01.163
    
    This equation is used along with the substrate concentration versus 
time data to determine the best fit parameters (Q<INF>m</INF> and 
K<INF>s</INF>) to describe the biodegradation process in the sealed 
reactor.
    If the sealed reactor test is used, Form X is used to determine the 
headspace correction factor. The disappearance of a compound in the 
sealed reactor test is slowed because a fraction of the compound is not 
available for biodegradation because it is present in the headspace. If 
the compound is almost entirely in the liquid phase, the headspace 
correction factor is approximately one. If the headspace correction 
factor is substantially less than one, improved mass transfer or reduced 
headspace may improve the accuracy of the sealed reactor test. A 
preliminary sealed reactor test must be conducted to test the 
equilibrium assumption. As the compound of interest is degraded, 
simultaneous headspace and liquid samples should be collected and Form X 
should be used to evaluate K<INF>eq</INF>. The ratio of headspace to 
liquid concentrations must be constant in order to confirm that 
equilibrium conditions exist. If equilibrium conditions are not present, 
additional mixing or an alternate reactor configuration may be required.
    The compound-specific biorate constants are then calculated using 
Form XII. For the sealed reactor test, a stripping rate constant of zero 
and the headspace correction factor that was determined from Form X are 
entered on Form XII. The sealed reactor test may then be run, measuring 
the concentrations of each compound of interest as a function of time. 
If headspace concentrations are measured instead of liquid 
concentrations, then the corresponding liquid concentrations are 
calculated from the headspace measurements using K<INF>eq</INF> from 
Form X and entered on Form XII.
    The concentration data on Form XII may contain scatter that can 
adversely influence the data interpretation. It is possible to

[[Page 529]]

curve fit the concentration data and enter the concentrations on the 
fitted curve instead of the actual data. If curve fitting is used, the 
curve-fitting procedure must be based upon Equation App. C-6. When curve 
fitting is used, it is necessary to attach a plot of the actual data and 
the fitted curve to Form XII.
    If a sealed collapsible reactor is used that has no headspace, the 
headspace correction factor will equal 1, but the stripping rate 
constant may not equal 0 due to diffusion losses through the reactor 
wall. The ratio of the rate of loss of compound to the concentration of 
the compound in the reactor (units of per hour) must be evaluated. This 
loss ratio has the same units as the stripping rate constant and may be 
entered as the stripping rate constant on line 1 of Form XII.
    If the loss due to diffusion through the walls of the collapsible 
reactor is relatively large when compared to the biorate at low 
concentrations, it may be difficult to obtain accurate evaluations of 
the first-order biorate constant. In these cases, either replacing the 
materials used to construct the reactor with materials of low 
permeability or increasing the biomass concentration should be 
considered.
    The final result of the batch testing is the measurement of a 
biorate that can be used to estimate the fraction biodegraded, 
f<INF>bio</INF>. The number transferred to Form III is obtained from 
Form XII, line 9.
    The number on Form XII line 9 will equal the Monod first-order 
biorate constant if the full-scale system is operated in the first-order 
range. If the full-scale system is operated at concentrations above that 
of the Monod first-order range, the value of the number on line 9 will 
be somewhat lower than the Monod first-order biorate constant. With 
supporting biorate data, the Monod model used in Form XII may be used to 
estimate the effective biorate constant K1 for use in Form III.
    If a reactor with headspace is used, analysis of the data using 
equation App. C-6 is valid only if V<INF>l</INF> and V<INF>g</INF> do 
not change more than 10% (i.e., they can be approximated as constant for 
the duration of the test). Since biodegradation is occurring only in the 
liquid, as the liquid concentration decreases it is necessary for mass 
to transfer from the gas to the liquid phase. This may require vigorous 
mixing and/or reducing the volume in the headspace of the reactor.
    If there is no headspace (e.g., a collapsible reactor), equation 
App. C-6 is independent of V<INF>1</INF> and there are no restrictions 
on the liquid volume. If a membrane or bag is used as the collapsible-
volume reactor, it may be important to monitor for diffusion losses in 
the system. To determine if there are losses, the bag should be used 
without biomass and spiked with the compound(s) of interest. The 
concentration of the compound(s) in the reactor should be monitored over 
time. The data are analyzed as described above for the sealed reactor 
test.
    3. Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QA/QC). A QA/QC plan outlining 
the procedures used to determine the biodegradation rate constants shall 
be prepared and a copy maintained at the source. The plan should 
include, but may not be limited to:
    1. A description of the apparatus used (e.g., size, volume, method 
of supplying air or oxygen, mixing, and sampling procedures) including a 
simplified schematic drawing.
    2. A description of how biomass was sampled from the activated 
sludge unit.
    3. A description of how biomass was held prior to testing (age, 
etc.).
    4. A description of what conditions (DO, gas-liquid equilibrium, 
temperature, etc.) are important, what the target values are, how the 
factors were controlled, and how well they were controlled.
    5. A description of how the experiment was conducted, including 
preparation of solutions, dilution procedures, sampling procedures, 
monitoring of conditions, etc.
    6. A description of the analytical instrumentation used, how the 
instruments were calibrated, and a summary of the precision for that 
equipment.
    7. A description of the analytical procedures used. If appropriate, 
reference to an ASTM, EPA or other procedure may be used. Otherwise, 
describe how the procedure is done, what is done to measure precision, 
accuracy, recovery, etc., as appropriate.
    8. A description of how data are captured, recorded, and stored.
    9. A description of the equations used and their solutions, 
including a reference to any software used for calculations and/or 
curve-fitting.

        E. Multiple Zone Concentration Measurements (Procedure 5)

    Procedure 5 is the concentration measurement method that can be used 
to determine the f<INF>bio</INF> for units that are not thoroughly mixed 
and thus have multiple zones of mixing. As with the other procedures, 
proper determination of f<INF>bio</INF> must be made on a system as it 
would exist under the rule. For purposes of this calculation, the 
biological unit must be divided \1\ into zones with uniform 
characteristics within each zone. The number of zones that is used 
depends on the complexity of the unit. Reference 8, ``Technical Support

[[Page 530]]

Document for the Evaluation of Aerobic Biological Treatment Units with 
Multiple Mixing Zones,'' is a source for further information concerning 
how to determine the number of zones that should be used for evaluating 
your unit. The following information on the biological unit must be 
available to use this procedure: basic unit variables such as inlet and 
recycle wastewater flow rates, type of agitation, and operating 
conditions; measured representative organic compound concentrations in 
each zone and the inlet and outlet; and estimated mass transfer 
coefficients for each zone.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ This is a mathematical division of the actual unit; not addition 
of physical barriers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Reference 8 ``Technical Support Document for the Evaluation of 
Aerobic Biological Treatment Units with Multiple Mixing Zones,'' is a 
source for further information concerning how to interpolate the 
biorates for multiple zones. In units with well-characterized 
concentration measurements obtained in an initial evaluation of the 
unit, it may be possible to demonstrate that there is a good correlation 
of the component concentrations with the locations in the multiple-zone 
unit. With this good correlation, it may be possible to accurately 
predict the concentrations in selected zones without actually testing 
each selected zone. This correlation method may be used for units that 
have many zones (greater than 5) or where one of the interior zones is 
not readily accessible for sampling. To use this correlation method of 
estimating zone concentrations, it is necessary to measure the 
concentrations in the inlet unit, the exit unit, and sufficient interior 
units to obtain a correlation of component concentrations with the 
locations. You cannot use this correlation method of estimating selected 
zone concentrations if monitoring of each zone is required, or if the 
accuracy and precision of the correlation is inferior to actual 
individual sampling error. The accuracy and precision of the correlation 
may be improved by increasing the number of locations tested. Because 
the correlation is based on many samples, it should provide an accurate 
representation of a stable operating system.
    The estimated mass transfer coefficient for each compound in each 
zone is obtained from Form II using the characteristics of each zone. A 
computer model may be used. If the Water7 model or the most recent 
update to this model is used, then use Form II-A to calculate KL. The 
TOXCHEM or BASTE model may also be used to calculate KL for the 
biological treatment unit, with the stipulations listed in Procedure 
304B. Compound concentration measurements for each zone are used in Form 
XIII to calculate the f<INF>bio</INF>. A copy of Form XIII is completed 
for each of the compounds of concern treated in the biological unit.

                         IV. Calculation of Fbio

    At this point, the individual f<INF>bios</INF> determined by the 
previously explained procedures must be summed to obtain the total 
F<INF>bio</INF>. To determine the F<INF>bio</INF> multiply each compound 
specific f<INF>bio</INF> by the compound-specific average mass flow rate 
of the organic compound in the wastewater stream (see regulation for 
instruction on calculation of average mass flow rate). Sum these 
products and divide by the total wastewater stream average mass flow 
rate of organic compounds.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.040

M=compound specific average mass flow rate of the organic compounds in 
the wastewater (Mg/Yr)
n=number of organic compounds in the wastewater

    The F<INF>bio</INF> is then used in the applicable compliance 
equations in the regulation to determine if biodegradation may be used 
to comply with the treatment standard without covering and venting to an 
air pollution control device.

  Sec. Appendix D to Part 63--Alternative Validation Procedure for EPA 
                      Waste and Wastewater Methods

                            1. Applicability

    This procedure is to be applied exclusively to Environmental 
Protection Agency methods developed by the Office of Water and the 
Office of Solid Waste. Alternative methods developed by any other group 
or agency shall be validated according to the procedures in Sections 5.1 
and 5.3 of Test Method 301, 40 CFR Part 63, Appendix A. For the purposes 
of this appendix, ``waste'' means waste and wastewater.

                              2. Procedure

    This procedure shall be applied once for each waste matrix. Waste 
matrix in the context of this procedure refers to the target compound 
mixture in the waste as well as the formulation of the medium in which 
the

[[Page 555]]

target compounds are suspended. The owner or operator shall prepare a 
sampling plan. Wastewater samples shall be collected using sampling 
procedures which minimize loss of organic compounds during sample 
collection and analysis and maintain sample integrity. The sample plan 
shall include procedures for determining recovery efficiency of the 
relevant compounds regulated in the applicable subpart. An example of an 
acceptable sampling plan would be one that incorporates similar sampling 
and sample handling requirements to those of Method 25D of 40 CFR part 
60, appendix A.
    2.1. Sampling and Analysis
    2.1.1. For each waste matrix, collect twice the number of samples 
required by the applicable regulation. Designate and label half the 
sample vials the ``spiked'' sample set, and the other half the 
``unspiked'' sample set. Immediately before or immediately after 
sampling (immediately after in the context of this procedure means after 
placing the sample into the sample vial, but before the sample is 
capped, cooled, and shipped to the laboratory for analysis), inject, 
either individually or as a solution, all the target compounds into each 
spiked sample.
    2.1.2. The mass of each spiked compound shall be 40 to 60 percent of 
the mass expected to be present in the waste matrix. If the 
concentration of the target compounds in the waste are not known, the 
mass of each spiked compound shall be 40 to 60 percent of the limit 
allowed in the applicable regulation. Analyze both sets of samples 
(spiked and unspiked) with the chosen method.

                             3. Calculations

    For each pair of spiked and unspiked samples, determine the fraction 
of spiked compound recovered (R) using the following equations.

where:

m<INF>r</INF> = mass spiked compound measured ([micro] g).
m<INF>s</INF> = total mass of compound measured in spiked sample 
([micro] g).
m<INF>u</INF> = total mass of compound measured in unspiked sample 
([micro] g).

where:

S = theoretical mass of compound spiked into spiked sample ([micro] g).
    3.1. Method Evaluation
    In order for the chosen method to be acceptable for a compound, 
0.70<=R<=1.30 (R in this case is an average value of all the spiked and 
unspiked sample set R values). If the average R value does not meet this 
criterion for a target compound, the chosen method is not acceptable for 
that compound, and therefore another method shall be evaluated for 
acceptance (by repeating the procedures outlined above with another 
method).
    3.2. Records and Reports
    Report the average R value in the test report and correct all 
reported measurements made with the method with the calculated R value 
for that compound by using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01JY96.048

    3.3. Optional Correction Step
    If the applicable regulation allows for correction of the mass of 
the compound in the waste by a published f<INF>m</INF> value, multiply 
the reported result calculated above with the appropriate f<INF>m</INF> 
value for that compound.

Sec. Appendix E to Part 63--Monitoring Procedure for Nonthoroughly Mixed 
   Open Biological Treatment Systems at Kraft Pulp Mills Under Unsafe 
                           Sampling Conditions

                               I. Purpose

    This procedure is required to be performed in subpart S of this 
part, entitled National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants 
from the Pulp and Paper Industry. Subpart S requires this procedure in 
Sec. 63.453(p)(3) to be followed during unsafe sampling conditions when 
it is not practicable to obtain representative samples of hazardous air 
pollutants (HAP) concentrations from an open biological treatment unit. 
It is assumed that inlet and outlet HAP concentrations from the open 
biological treatment unit may be obtained during the unsafe sampling 
conditions. The purpose of this procedure is to estimate the 
concentration of HAP within the open biological treatment unit based on 
information obtained at inlet and outlet sampling locations in units 
that are not thoroughly mixed and, therefore, have different 
concentrations of HAP at different locations within the unit.

                             II. Definitions

    Biological treatment unit = wastewater treatment unit designed and 
operated to promote the growth of bacteria to destroy organic materials 
in wastewater.


[[Page 556]]


f<INF>bio</INF> =The fraction of organic compounds in the wastewater 
biodegraded in a biological treatment unit.
Fe=The fraction of applicable organic compounds emitted from the 
wastewater to the atmosphere.
K1=First-order biodegradation rate constant, L/g mixed liquor volatile 
suspended solids (MLVSS)-hr
KL=Liquid-phase mass transfer coefficient, m/s
Ks=Monod biorate constant at half the maximum rate, g/m\3\

 III. Test Procedure for Determination of fbio for Nonthoroughly Mixed 
    Open Biological Treatment Units Under Unsafe Sampling Conditions

    This test procedure is used under unsafe sampling conditions that do 
not permit practicable sampling of open biological treatment units 
within the unit itself, but rather relies on sampling at the inlet and 
outlet locations of the unit. This procedure may be used only under 
unsafe sampling conditions to estimate f<INF>bio</INF>. Once the unsafe 
conditions have passed, then the formal compliance demonstration 
procedures of f<INF>bio</INF> based upon measurements within the open 
biological treatment unit must be completed.

                   A. Overview of Estimation Procedure

    The steps in the estimation procedure include data collection, the 
estimation of concentrations within the unit, and the use of Form 1 to 
estimate f<INF>bio</INF>. The data collection procedure consists of two 
separate components. The first data collection component demonstrates 
that the open biological treatment unit can be represented by Monod 
kinetics and characterizes the effectiveness of the open biological 
treatment unit as part of the initial performance test, and the second 
data collection component is used when there are unsafe sampling 
conditions. These two data collection components are used together in a 
data calculation procedure based on a Monod kinetic model to estimate 
the concentrations in each zone of the open biological treatment unit. 
After the first two components of data collection are completed, the 
calculation procedures are used to back estimate the zone 
concentrations, starting with the last zone in the series and ending 
with the first zone.

                     B. Data Collection Requirements

    This method is based upon modeling the nonthoroughly mixed open 
biological treatment unit as a series of well-mixed zones with internal 
recycling between the units and assuming that two Monod biological 
kinetic parameters can be used to characterize the biological removal 
rates in each unit. The data collection procedure consists of two 
separate components. The first data collection component is part of the 
initial performance test, and the second data collection component is 
used during unsafe sampling conditions.

                       1. Initial Performance Test

    The objective of the first data collection component is to 
demonstrate that the open biological treatment unit can be represented 
by Monod kinetics and to characterize the performance of the open 
biological treatment unit. An appropriate value of the biorate constant, 
Ks, is determined using actual sampling data from the open biological 
treatment unit. This is done during the initial performance test when 
the open biological treatment unit is operating under normal conditions. 
This specific Ks value obtained during the initial performance test is 
used in the calculation procedure to characterize the open biological 
treatment unit during unsafe sampling conditions. The following open 
biological treatment unit characterization information is obtained from 
the first component of the data collection procedure:
    (1) The value of the biorate constant, Ks;
    (2) The number and characteristics of each zone in the open 
biological treatment unit (depth, area, characterization parameters for 
surface aeration, submerged aeration rates, biomass concentration, 
concentrations of organic compounds, dissolved oxygen (DO), dissolved 
solids, temperature, and other relevant variables); and
    (3) The recycle ratio of internal recirculation between the zones. 
The number of zones and the above characterization of the zones are also 
used to determine the performance of the unit under the unsafe sampling 
conditions of concern.

           2. Data Collected Under Unsafe Sampling Conditions

    In the second data collection component obtained under unsafe 
sampling conditions, the measured inlet and outlet HAP concentrations 
and the biomass concentration are obtained for the open biological 
treatment unit. After the site specific data collection is completed on 
the day a parameter excursion occurs, the inlet and outlet 
concentrations are used with the prior open biological treatment unit 
characterization to estimate the concentrations of HAP in each zone. The 
following information on the open biological treatment unit must be 
available in the second data collection component:
    (1) Basic unit variables such as inlet and recycle wastewater flow 
rates, type of agitation, and operating conditions;
    (2) The value of the inlet and outlet HAP concentrations; and
    (3) The biomass concentration in the open biological treatment unit.

[[Page 557]]

 C. One Time Determination of a Single Value of Ks (Initial Performance 
                                  Test)

    A single value of Ks is calculated using Form 3 for each data set 
that is collected during the initial performance test. A single 
composite value of Ks, deemed to be representative of the biological 
unit, is subsequently selected so that the f<INF>bio</INF> values 
calculated by the procedures in this appendix (using this single value 
of Ks) for the data sets collected during the initial performance test 
are within 10 percent of the f<INF>bio</INF> value determined by using 
Form 1 with these same data sets. The value of Ks meeting these criteria 
is obtained by the following steps:
    (1) Determine the median of the Ks values calculated for each data 
set;
    (2) Estimate f<INF>bio</INF> for each data set using the selected Ks 
value (Form 1 and Form 2);
    (3) Calculate f<INF>bio</INF> for each data set using Form 1; and
    (4) Compare the f<INF>bio</INF> values obtained in steps (2) and 
(3); if the f<INF>bio</INF> value calculated using step (2) differs from 
that calculated using step (3) by more than 10 percent, adjust Ks 
(decrease Ks if the f<INF>bio</INF> value is lower than that calculated 
by Form 1 and vice versa) and repeat this procedure starting at step 
(2). If a negative value is obtained for the values of Ks, then this 
negative kinetic constant may not be used with the Monod model. If a 
negative value of Ks is obtained, this test procedure cannot be used for 
evaluating the performance of the open biological treatment unit.

      D. Confirmation of Monod Kinetics (Initial Performance Test)

    (1) Confirmation that the unit can be represented by Monod kinetics 
is made by identifying the following two items:
    (i) The zone methanol concentrations measured during the initial 
performance test; and
    (ii) The zone methanol concentrations estimated by the Multiple Zone 
Concentrations Calculations Procedure based on inlet and outlet 
concentrations (Column A of Form 2). For each zone, the concentration in 
item 1 is compared to the concentration in item 2.
    (2) For each zone, the estimated value of item 2 must be:
    (i) Within 25 percent of item 1 when item 1 exceeds 8 mg/L; or
    (ii) Within 2 mg/L of item 1 when item 1 is 8 mg/L or less.
    (3) Successful demonstration that the calculated zone concentrations 
meet these criteria must be achieved for 80 percent of the performance 
test data sets.
    (4) If negative values are obtained for the values of K1 and Ks, 
then these negative kinetic constants may not be used with the Monod 
model, even if the criteria are met. If negative values are obtained, 
this test procedure cannot be used for evaluating the performance of the 
open biological treatment unit.

    E. Determination of KL for Each Zone (Unsafe Sampling Conditions)

    (1) A site-specific liquid-phase mass transfer coefficient (KL) must 
be obtained for each zone during the unsafe sampling conditions. Do not 
use a default value for KL. The KL value for each zone must be based on 
the site-specific parameters of the specific unit. The first step in 
using this procedure is to calculate KL for each zone in the unit using 
Form 4. Form 4 outlines the procedure to follow for using mass transfer 
equations to determine KL. Form 4 identifies the appropriate form to use 
for providing the detailed calculations to support the estimate of the 
value of KL. Forms 5 and 6 are used to provide individual compound 
estimates of KL for quiescent and aerated impoundments, respectively. A 
computer model may be used to perform the calculations. If the WATER8 
model or the most recent update to this model is used, then report the 
computer model input parameters that you used as an attachment to Form 
4. In addition, the Bay Area Sewage Toxics Emission (BASTE) model, 
version 3.0, or equivalent upgrade and the TOXCHEM (Environment Canada's 
Wastewater Technology Centre and Environmega, Ltd.) model, version 1.10, 
or equivalent upgrade may also be used to determine KL for the open 
biological treatment unit with the following stipulations:
    (i) The programs must be altered to output a KL value that is based 
on the site-specific parameters of the unit modeled; and
    (ii) The Henry's law value listed in Form 4 must be substituted for 
the existing Henry's law values in the models.
    (2) The Henry's law value listed in Form 4 may be obtained from the 
following sources:
    (i) Values listed by EPA with temperature adjustment if needed;
    (ii) Measured values for the system of concern with temperature 
adjustment; or
    (iii) Literature values of Henry's law values for methanol, adjusted 
for temperature if needed.
    (3) Input values used in the model and corresponding output values 
shall become part of the documentation of the f<INF>bio</INF> 
determination. The owner or operator should be aware that these models 
may not provide equivalent KL values for some types of units. To obtain 
an equivalent KL value in this situation, the owner or operator shall 
either use the appropriate procedure on Form 4 or adjust the KL value 
from the model to the equivalent KL value as described on Form 4.
    (4) Report the input parameters that you used in the computer model 
on Forms 5, 6, and 7 as an attachment to Form 4. If you have submerged 
air flow in your unit, you must add the value of KL estimated on Form 7 
to the value of KL obtained with Forms 5

[[Page 558]]

and 6 before using the value of KL with Form 2.

    F. Estimation of Zone Concentrations (Unsafe Sampling Conditions)

    Form 2 is used to estimate the zone concentrations of HAP based on 
the inlet and outlet data. The value of Ks entered on the form is that 
single composite value of Ks discussed in section III.C of this 
appendix. This value of Ks is calculated during the Initial Performance 
Test (and subsequently updated, if necessary). A unique value of the 
biorate K1 is entered on line 5 of Form 2, and the inlet concentration 
is estimated in Column A of Form 2. The inlet concentration is located 
in the row of Form 2 corresponding to zone 0. If there are three zones 
in the system, n-3 equals 0 for the inlet concentration row. These 
estimated zone concentrations are then used in Form 1 to estimate f bio 
for the treatment unit.

              G. Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QA/QC)

    A QA/QC plan outlining the procedures used to determine the measured 
inlet and outlet concentrations during unsafe conditions and how the 
zone characterization data were obtained during the initial performance 
test shall be prepared and submitted with the initial performance test 
report. The plan should include, but may not be limited to:
    (1) A description of each of the sampling methods that were used 
(method, procedures, time, method to avoid losses during sampling and 
holding, and sampling procedures) including simplified schematic 
drawings;
    (2) A description of how that biomass was sampled from the 
biotreatment unit, including methods, locations, and times;
    (3) A description of what conditions (DO, temperature, etc.) are 
important, what the target values are in the zones, how the factors were 
controlled, and how they were monitored. These conditions are primarily 
used to establish that the conditions of the initial performance test 
correspond to the conditions of the day in question;
    (4) A description of how each analytical measurement was conducted, 
including preparation of solutions, dilution procedures, sampling 
procedures, monitoring of conditions, etc;
    (5) A description of the analytical instrumentation used, how the 
instruments were calibrated, and a summary of the accuracy and precision 
for each instrument;
    (6) A description of the test methods used to determine HAP 
concentrations and other measurements. Section 63.457(c)(3) specifies 
the test methods that must be used to determine HAP concentrations. 
During unsafe sampling conditions, you do not have to sample over an 
extended period of time or obtain more than one sample at each sample 
point.
    (7) A description of how data are captured, recorded, and stored; 
and
    (8) A description of the equations used and their solutions for 
sampling and analysis, including a reference to any software used for 
calculations and/or curve-fitting.

     IV. Calculation of Individual fbio (Unsafe Sampling Conditions)

    Use Form 1 with your zone concentration information to estimate the 
value of f bio under unsafe sampling conditions. Form 1 uses measured 
concentrations of HAP in the unit inlet and outlet, and Form 1 also uses 
the estimated concentrations in each zone of the unit obtained from Form 
2. This procedure may be used on an open biological treatment unit that 
has defined zones within the unit. Use Form 1 to determine 
f<INF>bio</INF> for each open biological treatment unit as it exists 
under subpart S of part 63. The first step in using Form 1 is to 
calculate KL for each zone in the unit using Form 4. Form 7 must also be 
used if submerged aeration is used. After KL is determined using field 
data, obtain the concentrations of the HAP in each zone. In this 
alternative procedure for unsafe sampling conditions, the actual 
measured concentrations of the HAP in each zone are replaced with the 
zone concentrations that are estimated with Form 2. After KL and the 
zone concentrations are determined, Form 1 is used to estimate the 
overall unit Fe and f<INF>bio</INF> for methanol.
