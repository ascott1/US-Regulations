                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2003), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

<R05>
Sec. 202.21  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart sets forth the procedures to be followed when a 
subpoena, order, or other demand (hereinafter referred to as a 
``demand'') of a court or other authority is issued for the production 
or disclosure of (1) any material contained in the files of the 
Department of Energy (DOE), (2) any information relating to material 
contained in the files of the DOE, or (3) any information or material 
acquired by any person while such person was an employee of the DOE as a 
part of the performance of his official duties or because of his 
official status.
    (b) For purposes of this subpart, the term ``Employee of the DOE'' 
includes all officers and employees of the United States appointed by, 
or subject to the supervision, jurisdiction, or control of, the 
Administrator of DOE.


<R05>
Sec. 202.22  Production or disclosure prohibited unless approved by appropriate DOE official.

    No employee or former employee of the DOE shall, in response to a 
demand of a court or other authority, produce any material contained in 
the file of the DOE or disclose any information relating to material 
contained in the files of the DOE, or disclose any information or 
produce any material acquired as part of the performance of his official 
duties or because of his official status without prior approval of the 
General Counsel of DOE.


<R05>
Sec. 202.23  Procedure in the event of a demand for production or disclosure.

    (a) Whenever a demand is made upon an employee or former employee of 
the DOE for the production of material or the disclosure of information 
described in Sec. 202.21(a), he shall immediately notify the Regional 
Counsel for the region where the issuing authority is located. The 
Regional Counsel shall immediately request instructions from the General 
Counsel of DOE.
    (b) If oral testimony is sought by the demand, an affidavit, or, if 
that is not feasible, a statement by the party seeking the testimony or 
his attorney, setting forth a summary of the testimony desired, must be 
furnished for submission by the Regional Counsel to the General Counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 202.24  Final action by the appropriate DOE official.

    If the General Counsel approves a demand for the production of 
material or disclosure of information, he shall so notify the Regional 
Counsel and such other persons as circumstances may warrant.

[[Page 6]]


<R05>
Sec. 202.25  Procedure where a decision concerning a demand is not made prior to the time a response to the demand is required.

    If response to the demand is required before the instructions from 
the General Counsel are received, a U.S. attorney or DOE attorney 
designated for the purpose shall appear with the employee or former 
employee of the DOE upon whom the demand has been made, and shall 
furnish the court or other authority with a copy of the regulations 
contained in this subpart and inform the court or other authority that 
the demand has been, or is being, as the case may be, referred for the 
prompt consideration of the appropriate DOE official and shall 
respectfully request the court or authority to stay the demand pending 
receipt of the requested instructions.


<R05>
Sec. 202.26  Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling.

    If the court or other authority declines to stay the effect of the 
demand in response to a request made in accordance with Sec. 202.25 
pending receipt of instructions, of if the court or other authority 
rules that the demand must be complied with irrespective of instructions 
not to produce the material or disclose the information sought, the 
employee or former employee upon whom the demand has been made shall 
respectfully decline to comply with the demand. ``United States ex rel

document or information because of a claim of attorney-client or other 
privilege, the person submitting the certification required by paragraph 
(f) of this section also shall submit a written list of the documents or 
the information withheld indicating a description of each document or 
information, the date of the document, each person shown on the document

Official shall determine whether the testimony shall be recorded and the 
means by which the testimony is recorded.

document with the DOE or a State Office claims that some or all the

person wishes to claim confidential treatment. The person shall indicate 
in the original document that it is confidential or contains 
confidential information and may file a statement specifying the 
justification for non-disclosure of the information for which 
confidential treatment is claimed. If the person states that the

confidentiality of information no less than five days prior to its 
public disclosure.

<R05>
Sec. 205.80  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart establishes the procedures for the filing of a 
formal request for an interpretation and for the consideration of such 
request. Responses, which may include verbal or written responses to 
general inquiries or to other than formal written requests for 
interpretation filed with the General Counsel or his delegate or a 
Regional Counsel, are not interpretations and merely provide general 
information.
    (b) A request for interpretation that includes, or could be 
construed to include an application for an exception or an exemption may 
be treated solely as a request for interpretation and processed as such.

Sec. 205.81  What to file.

    (a) A person filing under this subpart shall file a ``Request for 
Interpretation,'' which should be clearly labeled as such both on the 
request and on the outside of the envelope in which the request is 
transmitted, and shall be in writing and signed by the person filing the

filing requirements stated in Sec. 205.9 in addition to the requirements 
stated in this subpart.
    (b) If the person filing the request wishes to claim confidential

Sec. 205.9(f) shall apply.


<R05>
Sec. 205.82  Where to file.

<R05>
Sec. 205.83  Contents.

    (a) The request shall contain a full and complete statement of all 
relevant facts pertaining to the circumstances,

[[Page 18]]

act or transaction that is the subject of the request and to the DOE 
action sought. Such facts shall include the names and addresses of all 
affected persons (if reasonably ascertainable) and a full discussion of 
the pertinent provisions and relevant facts contained in the documents 
submitted with the request. Copies of all relevant contracts, 
agreements, leases, instruments, and other documents shall be submitted 
with the request. When the request pertains to only one step of a larger 
integrated transaction, the facts, circumstances, and other relevant 
information pertaining to the entire transaction must be submitted.
    (b) The request for interpretation shall include a discussion of all 
relevant authorities, including, but not limited to, DOE rulings, 
regulations, interpretations and decisions on appeals and exceptions 
relied upon to support the particular interpretation sought therein.


<R05>
Sec. 205.84  DOE evaluation.

    (a) Processing. (1) The DOE may initiate an investigation of any 
statement in a request and utilize in its evaluation any relevant facts 
obtained by such investigation. The DOE may accept submissions from 
third persons relevant to any request for interpretation provided that 
the person making the request is afforded an opportunity to respond to 
all third person submissions. In evaluating a request for 
interpretation, the DOE may consider any other source of information. 
The DOE on its own initiative may convene a conference, if, in its 
discretion, it considers that such conference will advance its 
evaluation of the request.
    (2) The DOE shall issue its interpretation on the basis of the 
information provided in the request, unless that information is 
supplemented by other information brought to the attention of the 
General Counsel or a Regional Counsel during the proceeding. The 
interpretation shall, therefore, depend for its authority on the 
accuracy of the factual statement and may be relied upon only to the 
extent that the facts of the actual situation correspond to those upon 
which the interpretation was based.
    (3) If the DOE determines that there is insufficient information 
upon which to base a decision and if upon request additional information 
is not submitted by the person requesting the interpretation, the DOE 
may refuse to issue an interpretation.
    (b) Criteria. (1) The DOE shall base an interpretation on the FEA 
and EPAA and the regulations and published rulings of the DOE as applied 
to the specific factual situation.
    (2) The DOE shall take into consideration previously issued 
interpretations dealing with the same or a related issue.


<R05>
Sec. 205.85  Decision and effect.

    (a) An interpretation may be issued after consideration of the 
request for interpretation and other relevant information received or 
obtained during the proceeding.
    (b) The interpretation shall contain a statement of the information 
upon which it is based and a legal analysis of and conclusions regarding 
the application of rulings, regulations and other precedent to the 
situation presented in the request.
    (c) Only those persons to whom an interpretation is specifically 
addressed and other persons upon whom the DOE serves the interpretation 
and who are directly involved in the same transaction or act may rely 
upon it. No person entitled to rely upon an interpretation shall be 
subject to civil or criminal penalties stated in subpart P of this part 
for any act taken in reliance upon the interpretation, notwithstanding 
that the interpretation shall thereafter be declared by judicial or 
other competent authority to be invalid.
    (d) An interpretation may be rescinded or modified at any time. 
Rescission or modification may be effected by notifying persons entitled 
to rely on the interpretation that it is rescinded or modified. This 
notification shall include a statement of the reasons for the recision 
or modification and, in the case of a modification, a restatement of the 
interpretation as modified.
    (e) An interpretation is modified by a subsequent amendment to the 
regulations or ruling to the extent that it is

[[Page 19]]

inconsistent with the amended regulation or ruling.
    (f)(1) Any person aggrieved by an interpretation may submit a 
petition for reconsideration to the General Counsel within 30 days of 
service of the interpretation from which the reconsideration is sought. 
There has not been an exhaustion of administrative remedies until a 
period of 30 days from the date of service of the interpretation has 
elapsed without receipt by the General Counsel of a petition for 
reconsideration or, if a petition for reconsideration of the 
interpretation has been filed in a timely manner, until that petition 
has been acted on by the General Counsel. However, a petition to which 
the General Counsel does not respond within 60 days of the date of 
receipt thereof, or within such extended time as the General Counsel may 
prescribe by written notice to the petitioner concerned within that 60 
day period, shall be considered denied.
    (2) A petition for reconsideration may be summarily denied if--
    (i) It is not filed in a timely manner, unless good cause is shown; 
or
    (ii) It is defective on its face for failure to state, and to 
present facts and legal argument in support thereof, that the 
interpretation was erroneous in fact or in law, or that it was arbitrary 
or capricious.
    (3) The General Counsel may deny any petition for reconsideration if 
the petitioner does not establish that--
    (i) The petition was filed by a person aggrieved by an 
interpretation;
    (ii) The interpretation was erroneous in fact or in law; or
    (iii) The interpretation was arbitrary or capricious. The denial of 
a petition shall be a final order of which the petitioner may seek 
judicial review.

<R05>
Sec. 205.170  Purpose and scope.

    This subpart establishes the procedures for requesting and 
conducting a DOE conference, hearing, or public hearing. Such 
proceedings shall be convened in the discretion of the DOE, consistent 
with the requirements of the FEAA.


<R05>
Sec. 205.171  Conferences.

    (a) The DOE in its discretion may direct that a conference be 
convened, on its own initiative or upon request by a person, when it 
appears that such conference will materially advance the proceeding. The 
determination as to who may attend a conference convened under this 
subpart shall be in the discretion of the DOE, but a conference will 
usually not be open to the public.
    (b) A conference may be requested in connection with any proceeding 
of the DOE by any person who might be aggrieved by that proceeding. The 
request may be made in writing or verbally, but must include a specific 
showing as to why such conference will materially advance the 
proceeding. The request shall be addressed to the DOE office that is 
conducting the proceeding.
    (c) A conference may only be convened after actual notice of the 
time, place, and nature of the conference is provided to the person who 
requested the conference.
    (d) When a conference is convened in accordance with this section, 
each person may present views as to the issue or issues involved. 
Documentary evidence may be presented at the conference, but will be 
treated as if submitted in the regular course of the proceedings. A 
transcript of the conference will not usually be prepared. However, the 
DOE in its discretion may have a verbatim transcript prepared.
    (e) Because a conference is solely for the exchange of views 
incident to a proceeding, there will be no formal reports or findings 
unless the DOE in its discretion determines that such would be 
advisable.


<R05>
Sec. 205.172  Hearings.

    (a) The DOE in its discretion may direct that a hearing be convened 
on its own initiative or upon request by a person, when it appears that 
such hearing will materially advance the proceedings. The determination 
as to who may attend a hearing convened under this subpart shall be in 
the discretion of DOE, but a hearing will usually not be open to the 
public. Where the hearing involves a matter arising under part 213, the 
Director of Oil Imports shall be notified as to its time and place, in 
order that he or his representative may present views as to the issue or 
issues involved.
    (b) A hearing may only be requested in connection with an 
application for an exception or an appeal. Such request may be by the 
applicant, appellant, or any other person who might be aggrieved by the 
DOE action sought. The request shall be in writing and shall include a 
specific showing as to why such hearing will materially advance the 
proceeding. The request shall be addressed to the DOE office that is 
considering the application for an exception or the appeal.
    (c) The DOE will designate an agency official to conduct the 
hearing, and will specify the time and place for the hearing.
    (d) A hearing may only be convened after actual notice of the time, 
place, and nature of the hearing is provided both to the applicant or 
appellant and to any other person readily identifiable by the DOE as one 
who will be aggrieved by the DOE action involved. The notice shall 
include, as appropriate:

[[Page 21]]

    (1) A statement that such person may participate in the hearing; or
    (2) A statement that such person may request a separate conference 
or hearing regarding the application or appeal.
    (e) When a hearing is convened in accordance with this section, each 
person may present views as to the issue or issues involved. Documentary 
evidence may be presented at the hearing, but will be treated as if 
submitted in the regular course of the proceedings. A transcript of the 
hearing will not usually be prepared. However, the DOE in its discretion 
may have a verbatim transcript prepared.
    (f) The official conducting the hearing may administer oaths and 
affirmations, rule on the presentation of information, receive relevant 
information, dispose of procedural requests, determine the format of the 
hearing, and otherwise regulate the course of the hearing.
    (g) Because a hearing is solely for the exchange of views incident 
to a proceeding, there will be no formal reports or findings unless the 
DOE in its discretion determines that such would be advisable.

substantial impact on the Nation's economy or large numbers of 
individuals or businesses; or
    (2) When the DOE determines that a public hearing would materially 
advance the consideration of the issue. A public hearing may be 
requested by any interested person in connection with a rulemaking 
proceeding, but shall only be convened on the initiative of the DOE 
unless otherwise required by statute.
    (b) A public hearing may be convened incident to any proceeding when 
the DOE in its discretion determines that such public hearing would

time, place, and nature of the public hearing.
    (d) Interested persons may file a request to participate in the 
public hearing in accordance with the instructions in the notice 
published in the Federal Register. The request shall be in writing and 
signed by the person making the request. It shall include a description 
of the person's interest in the issue or issues involved and of the 
anticipated content of the presentation. It shall also contain a 
statement explaining why the person would be an appropriate spokesperson 
for the particular view expressed.

<R05>
Sec. 205.190  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart establishes the procedures for determining the 
nature and extent of violations of the DOE regulations in parts 210, 
211, and 212 and the procedures for issuance of a Notice of Probable 
Violation, a Proposed Remedial Order, a Remedial Order, an Interim 
Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, a Remedial Order for Immediate 
Compliance, a Notice of Probable Disallowance, a Proposed Order of 
Disallowance, an Order of Disallowance, or a Consent Order. Nothing in 
these regulations shall affect the authority of DOE enforcement 
officials in coordination with the Department of Justice to initiate 
appropriate civil or criminal enforcement actions in court at any time.
    (b) When any report required by the ERA or any audit or 
investigation discloses, or the ERA otherwise discovers, that there is 
reason to believe a violation of any provision of this chapter, or any 
order issued thereunder, has occurred, is continuing or is about to 
occur, the ERA may conduct an inquiry to determine the nature and extent 
of the violation. A Remedial Order or Order of Disallowance may be 
issued thereafter by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. The ERA may 
commence enforcement proceedings by serving a Notice of Probable 
Violation, a Notice of Probable Disallowance, a Proposed Remedial Order, 
a Proposed Order of Disallowance, or an Interim Remedial Order for 
Immediate Compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 205.191  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 205.192  Proposed remedial order.

    (a) If the ERA finds, after the 30-day or other period authorized 
for reply to the Notice of Probable Violation, that a violation has 
occurred, is continuing, or is about to occur, it may issue a Proposed 
Remedial Order, which shall set forth the relevant facts and law.
    (b) The ERA may issue a Proposed Remedial Order at any time it finds 
that a violation has occurred, is continuing, or is about to occur even 
if it has not previously issued a Notice of Probable Violation.
    (c) The ERA shall serve a copy of the Proposed Remedial Order upon 
the person to whom it is directed. The ERA shall promptly publish a 
notice in the Federal Register which states the person to whom the 
Proposed Remedial Order is directed, his address, and the products, 
dollar amounts, time period, and geographical area specified in the 
Proposed Remedial Order. The notice shall indicate that a copy of the 
Proposed Remedial Order with confidential information, if any, deleted 
may be obtained from the ERA and that within 15 days after the date of 
publication any aggrieved person may file a Notice of Objection with the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals of accordance with Sec. 205.193. The ERA 
shall mail copies of the Federal Register notice to all readily 
identifiable persons who are likely to be aggrieved by issuance of the 
Proposed Remedial Order as a final order.
    (d) The Proposed Remedial Order shall set forth the proposed 
findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which it is based. It shall 
also include a discussion of the relevant authorities which support the 
position asserted, including rules, regulations, rulings, 
interpretations and previous decisions issued by DOE or its predecessor 
agencies. The Proposed Remedial Order shall be accompaned by a 
declaration executed by the DOE employee primarily knowledgeable about 
the facts of the case stating that, to the best of declarant's knowledge 
and belief, the findings of fact are correct.
    (e) The ERA may amend or withdraw a Proposed Remedial Order at its 
discretion prior to the date of service of a Statement of Objections in 
that proceeding. The date of service of the amended documents shall be 
considered the date of service of the Proposed Remedial Order in 
calculating the time periods specified in this part 205.


<R05>
Sec. 205.192A  Burden of proof.

    (a) In a Proposed Remedial Order proceeding the ERA has the burden 
of establishing a prima facie case as to the validity of the findings of 
fact and conclusions of law asserted therein. The ERA shall be deemed to 
meet this burden by the service of a Proposed Remedial Order that meets 
the requirements of Sec. 205.192(d) and any supplemental information 
that may be made available under Sec. 205.193A.

[[Page 23]]

    (b) Once a prima facie case has been established, a person who 
objects to a finding of fact or conclusion of law in the Proposed 
Remedial Order has the burden of going forward with the evidence. 
Furthermore, the proponent of additional factual representations has the 
burden of going forward with the evidence.
    (c) Unless otherwise specified by the Director of the Office of 
Hearings and Appeals or his designee, the proponent of an order or a 
motion or additional factual representations has the ultimate burden of 
persuasion.


<R05>
Sec. 205.193  Notice of Objection.

    (a) Within 15 days after publication of the notice of a Proposed 
Remedial Order in the Federal Register any aggrieved person may file a 
Notice of Objection to the Proposed Remedial Order with the Office of 
Hearings and Appeals. The Notice shall be filed in duplicate, shall 
briefly describe how the person would be aggrieved by issuance of the 
Proposed Remedial Order as a final order and shall state the person's 
intention to file a Statement of Objections. No confidential information 
shall be included in a Notice of Objection. The DOE shall place one copy 
of the Notice in the Office of Hearings and Appeals Public Docket Room.
    (b) A person who fails to file a timely Notice of Objection shall be 
deemed to have admitted the findings of fact and conclusions of law as 
stated in the Proposed Remedial Order. If a Notice of Objection is not 
filed as provided by paragraph (a) of this section, the Proposed 
Remedial Order may be issued as a final order.
    (c) A person who files a Notice of Objection shall on the same day 
serve a copy of the Notice upon the person to whom the Proposed Remedial 
Order is directed, the DOE Office that issued the Proposed Remedial 
Order, and the DOE Assistant General Counsel for Administrative 
Litigation.
    (d) The Notice shall include a certification of compliance with the 
provisions of this section, the names and addresses of each person 
served with a copy of the Notice, and the date and manner of service.
    (e) If no person files a timely Notice of Objection, ERA may request 
the Office of Hearings and Appeals to issue the Proposed Remedial Order 
as a final Remedial Order.
    (f) In order to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to a 
Remedial Order proceeding, a person must file a timely Notice of 
Objection and Statement of Objections with the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals.


<R05>
Sec. 205.193A  Submission of ERA supplemental information.

    Within 20 days after service of a Notice of Objection to a Proposed 
Remedial Order the ERA may serve, upon the person to whom the Proposed 
Remedial Order was directed, supplemental information relating to the 
calculations and determinations which support the findings of fact set 
forth in the Proposed Remedial Order.

and Appeals shall publish a notice in the Federal Register which states 
the person to whom the Proposed Remedial Order is directed, his address 
and the products, dollar amounts, time period, and geographical area 
specified in the Proposed Remedial Order. The notice shall state that 
any person who wishes to participate in the proceeding must file an 
appropriate request with the Office of Hearings and Appeals.
    (b) The Office that issued the Proposed Remedial Order and the 
person to whom the Order is directed shall be considered participants 
before the Office of Hearings and Appeals at all stages of an 
enforcement proceeding. Any other person whose interest may be affected 
by the proceeding may file a request to participate in the proceeding 
with the Office of Hearings and Appeals within 20 days after publication 
of the notice referred to in paragraph (a) of this section. The request 
shall contain
    (1) The person's name, address, and telephone number and similar

    (c) After considering the requests submitted pursuant to paragraph 
(b) of this section, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall determine 
those persons who may participate on an active basis in the proceeding 
and the nature of their participation. Participants with similar 
interests may be required to consolidate their submissions and to appear 
in the proceeding through a common representative.
    (d) Within 30 days after publication of the notice referred to in 
paragraph (a) of this section, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall 
prepare an official service list for the proceeding. Within the same 30 
day period the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall mail the official 
service list to all persons who filed requests to participate. For good 
cause shown a person may be placed on the official service list as a 
non-participant, for the receipt of documents only. An opportunity shall 
be afforded to participants to oppose the placement of a non-participant 
on the official service list.
    (e) A person requesting to participate after the period for 
submitting requests has expired must show good cause for failure to file 
a request within the prescribed time period.
    (f) The Office of Hearings and Appeals may limit the nature of a 
person's participation in the proceeding, if it finds that the facts 
upon which the person's request was based have changed or were incorrect 
when stated or that the person has not been actively participating or 
has engaged in disruptive or dilatory conduct. The action referred to in 
this provision shall be taken only after notice and an opportunity to be 
heard are afforded.

service list except DOE offices, which shall be served both an original 
filing and one with deletions.
    (2) A DOE office shall on the date it files a submission serve all

delay the service of a submission containing arguably confidential 
information upon all persons other than the possessor of the 
confidential information and other DOE offices up to 14 days. The

request that the Motion be denied in whole or in part, stating the 
reasons which support the request.
    (e) Discovery may be conducted only pursuant to an Order issued by 
the Office of Hearings and Appeals. A Motion for Discovery will be 
granted if it is concluded that discovery is necessary for the party to 
obtain relevant and material evidence and that discovery will not unduly 
delay the proceeding. Depositions will be permitted if a convincing 
showing is made that the participant cannot obtain the material sought 
through one of the other discovery means specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (f) The Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his

    A participant who has unsuccessfully attempted in writing to obtain 
information that another participant claims is confidential may file a 
Motion for Discovery and Protective Order. This motion shall meet the 
requirements of Sec. 205.198 and shall specify the particular

the response, if any, shall be appended to the motion. The motion must 
give the possessor of the information notice that a Response to the 
Motion must be filed within ten days. The Response shall specify the 
safeguards, if any, that should be imposed if the information is ordered 
to be released. The Office of Hearings and Appeals may issue a

established only through the direct questioning of witnesses at an 
evidentiary hearing.
    (c) Response to Motion for Evidentiary Hearing. Within 20 days after 
service of any Motion for Evidentiary Hearing, the Office that issued

not in a position to accept or deny;
    (4) Each particular factual representation which is not accepted and 
the participant wishes proven by the submission of evidence;
    (5) Each particular factual representation which the participant is 
prepared to dispute through the testimony of witnesses or the submission 
of verified documents; and
    (6) Each particular factual representation which the participant 
asserts should be dismissed as immaterial or irrelevant.
    (d) Prehearing Conferences. After all submissions with respect to a 
Motion for Evidentiary Hearing are filed, the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals may conduct conferences or hearings to resolve differences of 
view among the participants.
    (e) Decision on Motion for Evidentiary Hearing. After considering 
all relevant information received in connection with the Motion, the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals shall enter an Order. In the Order the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals shall direct that an evidentiary hearing 
be convened if it concludes that a genuine dispute exists as to relevant 
and material issues of fact and an evidentiary hearing would 
substantially assist it in making findings of fact in an effective 
manner. If the Motion for Evidentiary Hearing is granted in whole or in 
part, the Order shall specify the parties to the hearing, any 
limitations on the participation of a party, and the issues of fact set 
forth for the evidentiary hearing. The Order may also require parties 
that have adopted similar positions to consolidate their presentations 
and to appear at the evidentiary hearing through a common 
representative. If the Motion is denied, the Order may allow the movant 
to file affidavits and other documents in support of his asserted 
findings of fact.
    (f) Review of Decision. The Order of the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals with respect to a Motion for Evidentiary Hearing shall be 
subject to further administrative review or appeal only upon issuance of 
the determination referred to in Sec. 205.199B.
    (g) Conduct of Evidentiary Hearing. All evidentiary hearings 
convened pursuant to this section shall be conducted by the Director of 
the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee. At any evidentiary 
hearing the parties shall have the opportunity to present material 
evidence which directly relates to a particular issue of fact set forth 
for hearing. The presiding officer shall afford the parties an 
opportunity to cross examine all witnesses. The presiding officer may 
administer oaths and affirmations, rule on objections to the 
presentation of evidence, receive relevant material, rule on any motion 
to conform the Proposed Remedial Order to the evidence presented, rule 
on motions for continuance, dispose of procedural requests, determine 
the format of the hearing, modify any order granting a Motion for 
Evidentiary Hearing, direct that written motions or briefs be provided 
with respect to issues raised during the course of the hearing, issue 
subpoenas, and otherwise regulate the conduct of the hearing. The 
presiding officer may take reasonable measures to exclude duplicative 
material from the hearing, and may place appropriate limitations on the 
number of witnesses that may be called by a party. The presiding officer 
may also require that evidence be submitted through affidavits or other 
documents if the direct testimony of witnesses will unduly delay the 
orderly

[[Page 28]]

progress of the hearing and would not contribute to resolving the issues 
involved in the hearing. The provisions of Sec. 205.8 which relate to 
subpoenas and witness fees shall apply to any evidentiary hearing, 
except that subsection Sec. 205.8(h) (2), (3), and (4) shall not apply.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199A  Hearing for the purpose of oral argument only.

    (a) A participant is entitled upon timely request to a hearing to 
present oral argument with respect to the Proposed Remedial Order, 
whether or not an evidentiary hearing is requested or convened. A 
participant's request shall normally be considered untimely, if made 
more than 10 days after service of a determination regarding any motion 
filed by the requestor or, if no motions were filed by him, if made 
after the date for filing his Reply or his Response to a Statement of 
Objections.
    (b) If an evidentiary hearing is convened, and a hearing for oral 
argument is requested, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall 
determine whether the hearing for oral argument shall be held in 
conjunction with the evidentiary hearing or at a separate time.
    (c) A hearing for the purpose of receiving oral argument will 
generally be conducted only after the issues involved in the proceeding 
have been delineated, and any written material which the Office of 
Hearings and Appeals has requested to supplement a Statement of 
Objections or Responses has been submitted. The presiding officer may 
require further written submissions in support of any position advanced 
or issued at the hearing, and shall allow responses any such 
submissions.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199B  Remedial order.

    (a) After considering all information received during the 
proceeding, the Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his 
designee may issue a final Remedial Order. The Remedial Order may adopt 
the findings and conclusions contained in the Proposed Remedial Order or 
may modify or rescind any such finding or conclusion to conform the 
Order to the evidence or on the basis of a determination that the 
finding or conclusion is erroneous in fact or law or is arbitrary or 
capricious. In the alternative, the Office of Hearings and Appeals may 
determine that no Remedial Order should be issued or may remand all or a 
portion of the Proposed Remedial Order to the issuing DOE office for 
further consideration or modification. Every determination made pursuant 
to this section shall state the relevant facts and legal bases 
supporting the determination.
    (b) The DOE shall serve a copy of any determination issued pursuant 
to paragraph (a) of this section upon the person to whom it is directed, 
any person who was served with a copy of the Proposed Remedial Order, 
the DOE office that issued the Proposed Remedial Order, the DOE 
Assistant General Counsel for Administrative Litigation and any other 
person on the official service list. Appropriate deletions may be made 
in the determinations to ensure that confidentiality of information 
protected from disclosure under 18 U.S.C. 1905 and 5 U.S.C. 552. A copy 
of the determination with appropriate deletions to protect confidential 
and proprietary data shall be placed in the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals Public Docket Room.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199C  Appeals of remedial order to FERC.

    (a) The person to whom a Remedial Order is issued by the Office of 
Hearings and Appeals may file an administrative appeal if the Remedial 
Order proceeding was initiated by a Notice of Probable Violation issued 
after October 1, 1977, or, in those situations in which no Notice of 
Probable Violation was issued, if the proceeding was initiated by a 
Proposed Remedial Order issued after October 1, 1977.
    (b) Any such appeal must be initiated within 30 days after service 
of the Order by giving written notice to the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals that the person to whom a Remedial Order is issued wishes to 
contest the Order.
    (c) The Office of Hearings and Appeals shall promptly advise the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission of its receipt of a notice 
described in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) The Office of Hearings and Appeals may, on a case by case basis, 
set reasonable time limits for the Federal

[[Page 29]]

Energy Regulatory Commission to complete its action on such an appeal 
proceeding.
    (e) In order to exhaust administrative remedies, a person who is 
entitled to appeal a Remedial Order issued by the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals must file a timely appeal and await a decision on the merits. 
Any Remedial Order that is not appealed within the 30-day period shall 
become effective as a final Order of the DOE and is not subject to 
review by any court.

<R05>
Sec. 205.199F  Ex parte communications.

    (a) No person who is not employed or otherwise supervised by the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals shall submit ex parte communications to 
the Director or any person employed or otherwise supervised by the 
Office with respect to any matter involved in Remedial Order or Order of 
Disallowance proceedings.
    (1) Ex parte communications include any ex parte oral or written 
communications relative to the merits of a Proposed Remedial Order, 
Interim Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, or Proposed Order of 
Disallowance proceeding pending before the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals. The term shall not, however, include requests for status 
reports, inquiries as to procedures, or the submission of proprietary or 
confidential information. Notice that proprietary or confidential 
submissions have been made shall be given to all persons on the official 
service list.
    (b) If any communication occurs that violates the provisions of this 
section, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall promptly make the 
substance of the communication available to the public and serve a copy 
of a written communication or a memorandum summarizing an oral 
communication to all participants in the affected proceeding. The Office 
of Hearings and Appeals may also take any other appropriate action to 
mitigate the adverse impact to any person whose interest may be affected 
by the ex parte contact.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199G  Extension of time; Interim and Ancillary Orders.

    The Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee 
may permit upon motion any document or submission referred to in this 
subpart other than appeals to FERC to be amended or withdrawn after it 
has been filed or to be filed within a time period different from that 
specified in this subpart. The Director or his designee may upon motion 
or on his own initiative issue any interim or ancillary Orders, 
reconsider any determinations, or make any rulings or determinations 
that are deemed necessary to ensure that the proceedings specified in 
this subpart are conducted in an appropriate manner and are not unduly 
delayed.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199H  Actions not subject to administrative appeal.

    A Notice of Probable Violation, Notice of Proposed Disallowance, 
Proposed Remedial Order or Interim Remedial Order for Immediate 
Compliance issued pursuant to this subpart shall not be an action from 
which there may be an administrative appeal pursuant to subpart H. In 
addition, a determination by the Office of Hearings and Appeals that a 
Remedial Order, an Order of Disallowance, or a Remedial Order for 
Immediate Compliance should not be issued shall not be appealable 
pursuant to subpart H.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199I  Remedies.

    (a) A Remedial Order, a Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, an 
Order of Disallowance, or a Consent Order may require the person to whom 
it is directed to roll back prices, to make refunds equal to the amount 
(plus interest) charged in excess of those amounts permitted under DOE 
Regulations, to make appropriate compensation to third persons for 
administrative expenses of effectuating appropriate remedies, and to 
take such other action as the DOE determines is necessary to eliminate 
or to compensate for the effects of a violation or any cost disallowance 
pursuant to Sec. 212.83 or Sec. 212.84. Such action may include a 
direction to the person to whom the Order is issued to establish an 
escrow account or take other measures to

[[Page 30]]

make refunds directly to purchasers of the products involved, 
notwithstanding the fact that those purchasers obtained such products 
from an intermediate distributor of such person's products, and may 
require as part of the remedy that the person to whom the Order is 
issued maintain his prices at certain designated levels, notwithstanding 
the presence or absence of other regulatory controls on such person's 
prices. In cases where purchasers cannot be reasonably identified or 
paid or where the amount of each purchaser's overcharge is incapable of 
reasonable determination, the DOE may refund the amounts received in 
such cases directly to the Treasury of the United States on behalf of 
such purchasers.
    (b) The DOE may, when appropriate, issue final Orders ancillary to a 
Remedial Order, Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, Order of 
Disallowance, or Consent Order requiring that a direct or indirect 
recipient of a refund pass through, by such means as the DOE deems 
appropriate, including those described in paragraph (a) of this section, 
all or a portion of the refund, on a pro rata basis, to those customers 
of the recipient who were adversely affected by the initial overcharge. 
Ancillary Orders may be appealed to the Office of Hearings and Appeals 
only pursuant to subpart H.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199J  Consent order.

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, the DOE may 
at any time resolve an outstanding compliance investigation or 
proceeding, or a proceeding involving the disallowance of costs pursuant 
to Sec. 205.199E with a Consent Order. A Consent Order must be signed by 
the person to whom it is issued, or a duly authorized representative, 
and must indicate agreement to the terms contained therein. A Consent 
Order need not constitute an admission by any person that DOE 
regulations have been violated, nor need it constitute a finding by the 
DOE that such person has violated DOE regulations. A Consent Order 
shall, however, set forth the relevant facts which form the basis for 
the Order.
    (b) A Consent Order is a final Order of the DOE having the same 
force and effect as a Remedial Order issued pursuant to Sec. 205.199B or 
an Order of Disallowance issued pursuant to Sec. 205.199E, and may 
require one or more of the remedies authorized by Sec. 205.199I and 
Sec. 212.84(d)(3). A Consent Order becomes effective no sooner than 30 
days after publication under paragraph (c) of this section, unless (1) 
the DOE makes a Consent Order effective immediately, because it 
expressly deems it necessary in the public interest, or (2) the Consent 
Order involves a sum of less than $500,000 in the aggregate, excluding 
penalties and interest, in which case it will be effective when signed 
both by the person to whom it is issued and the DOE, and will not be 
subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section unless the 
DOE determines otherwise. A Consent Order shall not be appealable 
pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 205.199C or Sec. 205.199D and subpart 
H, and shall contain an express waiver of such appeal or judicial review 
rights as might otherwise attach to a final Order of the DOE.
    (c) When a Consent Order has been signed, both by the person to whom 
it is issued and the DOE, the DOE will publish notice of such Consent 
Order in the Federal Register and in a press release to be issued 
simultaneously therewith. The Federal Register notice and the press 
release will state at a minimum the name of the company concerned, a 
brief summary of the Consent Order and other facts or allegations 
relevant thereto, the address and telephone number of the DOE office at 
which copies of the Consent Order will be available free of charge, the 
address to which comments on the Consent Order will be received by the 
DOE, and the date by which such comments should be submitted, which date 
will not be less than 30 days after publication of the Federal Register 
notice. After the expiration of the comment period the DOE may withdraw 
its agreement to the Consent Order, attempt to negotiate a modification 
of the Consent Order, or issue the Consent Order as signed. The DOE will 
publish in the Federal Register, and by press release, notice of any 
action taken on a Consent Order and such explanation of

[[Page 31]]

the action taken as deemed appropriate. The provisions of this paragraph 
shall be applicable notwithstanding the fact that a Consent Order may 
have been made immediately effective pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section (except in cases where the Consent Order involves sums of less 
than $500,000 in the aggregate, excluding penalties and interest).
    (d) At any time and in accordance with the procedures of subpart J, 
a Consent Order may be modified or rescinded, upon petition by the 
person to whom the Consent Order was issued, and may be rescinded by the 
DOE upon discovery of new evidence which is materially inconsistent with 
evidence upon which the DOE's acceptance of the Consent Order was based. 
Modifications of a Consent Order which is subject to public comment 
under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, which in the 
opinion of the DOE significantly change the terms or the impact of the 
original Order, shall be republished under the provisions of that 
paragraph.
    (e) Notwithstanding the issuance of a Consent Order, the DOE may 
seek civil or criminal penalties or compromise civil penalties pursuant 
to subpart P concerning matters encompassed by the Consent Order, unless 
the Consent Order by its terms expressly precludes the DOE from so 
doing.
    (f) If at any time after a Consent Order becomes effective it 
appears to the DOE that the terms of the Consent Order have been 
violated, the DOE may refer such violations to the Department of Justice 
for appropriate action in accordance with subpart P.

<R05>
Sec. 205.280  Purpose and scope.

    This subpart establishes special procedures pursuant to which 
refunds may be made to injured persons in order to remedy the effects of 
a violation of the regulations of the Department of Energy. This subpart 
shall be applicable to those situations in which the Department of 
Energy is unable to readily identify persons who are entitled to

[[Page 33]]

refunds specified in a Remedial Order, a Remedial Order for Immediate 
Compliance, an Order of Disallowance or a Consent Order, or to readily 
ascertain the amounts that such persons are entitled to receive.


<R05>
Sec. 205.281  Petition for implementation of special refund procedures.

    (a) At any time after the issuance of a Remedial Order (including 
for purposes of this subpart a Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance 
and an Order of Disallowance), or a Consent Order, the Special Counsel 
of the Department of Energy, the ERA Office of Enforcement, or any other 
enforcement official of the Department of Energy may file with the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals a Petition for the Implementation of 
Special Refund Procedures.
    (b) The Petition shall state that the person filing it has been 
unable readily either to identify the persons who are entitled to 
refunds to be remitted pursuant to a Remedial Order or a Consent Order 
or to ascertain the amounts of refunds that such persons are entitled to 
receive. The Petition shall request that the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals institute appropriate proceedings under this Subpart to 
distribute the funds referred to in the enforcement documents.
    (c) The Petition shall contain a copy of each relevant enforcement 
document, shall be filed in duplicate, and shall meet the requirements 
of Sec. 205.9 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 205.282  Evaluation of petition by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.

    (a) After considering the Petition, the Director of the Office of 
Hearings and Appeals or his designee shall issue a Proposed Decision and 
Order. The Proposed Decision and Order shall generally describe the 
nature of the particular refund proceeding and shall set forth the 
standards and procedures that the Office of Hearings and Appeals intends 
to apply in evaluating refund claims.
    (b) The Proposed Decision and Order shall be published in the 
Federal Register together with a statement that any member of the public 
may submit written comments to the Office of Hearings and Appeals with 
respect to the matter. At least 30 days following publication in the 
Federal Register shall be provided for the submission of comments.
    (c) After considering the comments submitted, the Director of the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee shall issue a final 
Decision and Order which shall govern the disposition of the refunds. 
The final Decision and Order shall also be published in the Federal 
Register.
    (d) The final Decision and Order shall set forth the standards and 
procedures that will be used in evaluating individual Applications for 
Refunds and distributing the refund amount. Those standards and 
procedures shall be consistent with the provisions of this subpart.
    (e) In establishing standards and procedures for implementing refund 
distributions, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall take into 
account the desirability of distributing the refunds in an efficient, 
effective and equitable manner and resolving to the maximum extent 
practicable all outstanding claims. In order to do so, the standards for 
evaluation of individual claims may be based upon appropriate 
presumptions.


<R05>
Sec. 205.283  Applications for refund.

    (a) Any person entitled to a refund pursuant to a final Decision and 
Order issued pursuant to Sec. 205.282 may file an Application for 
Refund. All Applications must be signed by the applicant and specify the 
DOE order to which they pertain. Any Application for a refund in excess 
of $100 must be file in duplicate, and a copy of that Application will 
be available for public inspection in the DOE Public Docket Room at 2000 
M Street, NW., Washington, DC. Any applicant who believes that his 
Application contains confidential information must so indicate on the 
first page of his Application and submit two additional copies of his 
Application from which the information that the applicant claims is 
confidential has been deleted, together with a statement specifying why 
any such information is privileged or confidential.
    (b) The contents of an Application for Refund shall be specified in 
the final

[[Page 34]]

Decision and Order referred to in Sec. 205.282(c). A filing deadline for 
Applications shall also be specified in the final Decision and Order, 
and shall be no less than 90 days after the publication of the Order in 
the Federal Register.
    (c) Each Application shall be in writing and signed by the 
applicant, and shall indicate whether the applicant or any person acting 
on his instructions has filed or intends to file any other Application 
or claim of whatever nature regarding the matters at issue in the 
underlying enforcement proceeding. Each Application shall also include a 
sworn statement by the applicant that all information in his Application 
is true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief.


<R05>
Sec. 205.284  Processing of applications.

    (a) The Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals may appoint 
an administrator to evaluate Applications under guidelines established 
by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. The administrator, if he is not a 
Federal Government employee, may be compensated from the funds referred 
to in the Remedial Order or Consent Order. The administrator may design 
and distribute an optional application form for the convenience of the 
applicants.
    (b) The Office of Hearings and Appeals or its designee may initiate 
an investigation of any statement made in an Application and may require 
verification of any document submitted in support of a claim. In 
evaluating an Application, the Office of Hearings and Appeals or its 
designee may solicit and consider information obtained from any source 
and may on its own initiative convene a hearing or conference, if it 
determines that a hearing or conference will advance its evaluation of 
an Application.
    (c) The Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his 
designee shall conduct any hearing or conference convened with respect 
to an Application for Refund and shall specify the time and place for 
the hearing or conference and notify the applicant. The official 
conducting the hearing may administer oaths and affirmations, rule on 
the presentation of information, receive relevant information, dispose 
of procedural requests, determine the format of the hearing and 
otherwise regulate the course of the hearing. The provisions of 
Sec. 205.8 of this part which relate to subpoenas and witness fees shall 
apply to any hearing convened with respect to an application for refund, 
except that Sec. 205.8(h) (2), (3) and (4) shall not apply.
    (d) Upon consideration of an Application and other relevant 
information received during the course of a refund proceeding, the 
Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee shall 
issue an order granting or denying the Application. The order shall 
contain a concise statement of the relevant facts and the legal basis 
for the order. A copy of the order, with such modification as is 
necessary to ensure the confidentiality of information protected from 
public disclosure by 18 U.S.C. 1905, may be obtained upon request by an 
applicant or any other person who participated in the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 205.285  Effect of failure to file a timely application.

    An Application for Refund must be filed no later than the date that 
the Office of Hearings and Appeals establishes pursuant to 
Sec. 205.283(b). Any Application that is not filed on a timely basis may

<R05>
Sec. 205.328  Environmental requirements for Presidential Permits--Alternative 1.

    (a) NEPA Compliance. Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (e) of 
this section, when an applicant seeks a Presidential Permit, such 
applicant will be responsible for the costs of preparing any necessary 
environmental document, including an Environmental Impact Statement 
(EIS), arising from ERA's obligation to comply with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). ERA will determine whether an 
environmental assessment (EA) or EIS is required within 45 days of the 
receipt of the Presidential Permit application and of environmental 
information submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 205.322 (c) and (d). ERA will 
use these and other sources of information as the basis for making the 
environmental determination:
    (1) If an EIS is determined to be necessary, the applicant shall 
enter into a contract with an independent third party, which may be a 
Government-owned, contractor-operated National Laboratory, or a 
qualified private entity selected by ERA. The third party contractor 
must be qualified to conduct an environmental review and prepare an EIS, 
as appropriate, under the supervision of ERA, and may not have a 
financial or other interest in the outcome of the proceedings. The NEPA 
process must be completed and approved before ERA will issue a 
Presidential Permit.
    (2) If an EA is determined to be necessary, the applicant may be 
permitted to prepare an environmental assessment pursuant to 10 CFR 
1506.5(b) for review and adoption by ERA, or the applicant may enter 
into a third party contract as set forth in this section.
    (b) Environmental Review Procedure. Except as provided in paragraphs 
(c) and (e) of this section, environmental documents, including the EIS, 
where necessary, will be prepared utilizing the process set forth above. 
ERA, the applicant, and the independent third party, which may be a 
Government-owned, contractor-operated National Laboratory or a private 
entity, shall enter into an agreement in which the applicant will engage 
and pay directly for the services of the qualified third party to 
prepare the necessary environmental documents. The agreement shall 
outline the responsibilities of each party and its relationship to the 
other two parties regarding the work to be done or supervised. ERA shall 
approve the information to be developed and supervise the gathering, 
analysis

[[Page 41]]

and presentation of the information. In addition, ERA will have the 
authority to approve and modify any statement, analysis, and conclusion 
contained in the environmental documents prepared by the third party. 
Before commencing preparation of the environmental document the third 
party will execute an ERA-prepared disclosure document stating that it 
does not have any conflict of interest, financial or otherwise, in the 
outcome of either the environmental process or the Permit application.
    (c) Financial Hardship. Whenever ERA determines that a project is no 
longer economically feasible, or that a substantial financial burden 
would be imposed by the applicant bearing all of the costs of the NEPA 
studies, ERA may waive the requirement set forth in paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section and perform the necessary environmental review, 
completely or in part, with its own resources.
    (d) Discussions Prior to Filing. Prior to the preparation of any 
Presidential Permit application and environmental report, a potential 
applicant is encouraged to contact ERA and each affected State public 
utility regulatory agency to discuss the scope of the proposed project 
and the potential for joint State and Federal environmental review.
    (e) Federal Exemption. Upon a showing by the applicant that it is 
engaged in the transaction of official business of the Federal 
Government in filing the application pursuant to 10 CFR 205.320 et seq., 
it will be exempt from the requirements of this section.

[48 FR 33819, July 25, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 205.329  Environmental requirements for Presidential Permits--Alternative 2.

    (a) NEPA Compliance. Except as provided in paragraph (b) and (e) of 
this section, applicants seeking Presidential Permits will be 
financially responsible for the expenses of any contractor chosen by ERA 
to prepare any necessary environmental document arising from ERA's 
obligation to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
(NEPA) in issuing such Presidential Permits:
    (1) ERA will determine whether an Environmental Impact Statement 
(EIS) or an Environmental Assessment (EA) is required within 45 days of 
receipt of the Presidential Permit application and of the environmental 
information submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 205.322 (c) and (d). ERA will 
use these and other sources of information as the basis for making the 
environmental determination.
    (2) If an EIS is determined to be necessary, ERA will notify the 
applicant of the fee for completing the EIS within 90 days after the 
submission of the application and environmental information. The fee 
shall be based on the expenses estimated to be incurred by DOE in 
contracting to prepare the EIS (i.e., the estimated fee charges to ERA 
by the contractor). DOE employee salaries and other fixed costs, as set 
forth in OMB Circular A-25, shall not be included in the applicant's 
fee. Fee payment shall be by check, draft, or money order payable to the 
Treasurer of the United States, and shall be submitted to ERA. Upon 
submission of fifty percent of the environmental fee, ERA will provide 
to the applicant a tentative schedule for completion of the EIS.
    (3) If an EA is determined to be necessary, the applicant may be 
permitted to prepare an environmental assessment pursuant to 40 CFR 
1506.5(b) for review and adoption by ERA, or the applicant may choose to 
have ERA prepare the EA pursuant to the fee procedures set forth above.
    (4) The NEPA process must be completed and approved before ERA will 
issue a Presidential Permit.
    (b) Financial Hardship. Whenever ERA determines that a project is no 
longer economically feasible, or that a substantial financial burden 
would be imposed by the applicant bearing all of the costs of the NEPA 
studies, ERA may waive the requirement set forth in paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section and perform the necessary environmental review, 
completely or in part, with its own resources.
    (c) Discussions Prior to Filing. Prior to the preparation of any 
Presidential Permit application and environmental

[[Page 42]]

assessment, a potential applicant is encouraged to contact ERA and each 
affected State public utility regulatory agency to discuss the scope of 
the proposed project and the potential for joint State and Federal 
environmental review.
    (d) Fee Payment. The applicant shall make fee payment for completing 
the EIS to ERA in the following manner:
    (1) 50 percent of the total amount due to be paid within 30 days of 
receipt of the fee information from DOE;
    (2) 25 percent to be paid upon publication of the draft EIS; and
    (3) 25 percent to be paid upon publication of the final EIS.

If costs are less than the amount collected, ERA will refund to the 
applicant the excess fee collected. If costs exceed the initial fee, ERA 
will fund the balance, unless the increase in costs is caused by actions 
or inactions of the applicant, such as the applicant's failure to submit 
necessary environmental information in a timely fashion. If the

Sec. 205.351  Reporting requirements.

    For the purpose of this section, a report or a part of a report may 
be made jointly by two or more entities. Every electric utility or other 
entity engaged in the generation, transmission or distribution of 
electric energy for delivery and/or sale to the public shall report 
promptly, through the DOE Emergency Operations Center, by telephone, the 
occurrence of any event such as described in paragraphs (a) through (d) 
of this section. These reporting procedures are mandatory. Entities that 
fail to comply within 24 hours will be contacted and reminded of their 
reporting obligation.
    (a) Loss of Firm System Loads, caused by:
    (1) Any load shedding actions resulting in the reduction of over 100 
megawatts (MW) of firm customer load for reasons of maintaining the 
continuity of the bulk electric power supply system.
    (2) Equipment failures/system operational actions attributable to 
the loss of firm system loads for a period in excess of 15 minutes, as 
described below:
    (i) Reports from entities with a previous year recorded peak load of 
over 3000 MW are required for all such losses of firm loads which total 
over 300 MW.
    (ii) Reports from all other entities are required for all such 
losses of firm loads which total over 200 MW or 50 percent of the system 
load being supplied immediately prior to the incident, whichever is 
less.
    (3) Other events or occurrences which result in a continuous 
interruption for 3 hours or longer to over 50,000 customers, or more 
than 50 percent of the total customers being served immediately prior to 
the interruption, whichever is less.
    (b) Voltage Reductions or Public Appeals:

[[Page 43]]

    (1) Reports are required for any anticipated or actual system 
voltage reductions of 3 percent or greater for purposes of maintaining 
the continuity of the bulk electric power supply system.
    (2) Reports are required for any issuance of a public appeal to 
reduce the use of electricity for purposes of maintaining the continuity 
of the bulk electric power system.
    (c) Vulnerabilities that could Impact System Reliability:
    (1) Reports are required for any actual or suspected act(s) of 
physical sabotage (not vandalism) or terrorism directed at an electric 
power supply system, local or regional, in an attempt to either:
    (i) Disrupt or degrade the service reliability of the local or 
regional bulk electric power supply system, or
    (ii) Disrupt, degrade, or deny bulk electric power service to:
    (A) A specific facility (industrial, military, governmental, 
private), or
    (B) A specific service (transportation, communications), or
    (C) A specific locality (town, city, county).
    (2) Reports are required for any abnormal emergency system operating 
condition(s) or other event(s) which in the judgment of the reporting 
entity could or would constitute a hazard to maintaining the continuity 
of the bulk electric power supply system. Examples will be provided in 
the DOE pamphlet on reporting procedures.
    (d) Fuel Supply Emergencies:
    (1) Reports are required for any anticipated or existing fuel supply 
emergency situation which would threaten the continuity of the bulk 
electric power supply system, such as:
    (i) Fuel stocks or hydro project water storage levels are at 50 
percent (or less) of normal for that time of the year, and a continued 
downward trend is projected.
    (ii) Unscheduled emergency generation is dispatched causing an 
abnormal use of a particular fuel type, such that the future supply or 
stocks of that fuel could reach a level which threatens the reliability 
or adequacy of electric service.

<R05>
Sec. 205.370  Applicability.

    Sections 202(c) and 202(d) of the Federal Power Act are applicable 
to any ``entity'' which owns or operates electric power generation, 
transmission or distribution facilities. An ``entity'' is a private or 
public corporation (utility), a governmental agency, a municipality, a 
cooperative or a lawful association of the foregoing. Under this 
section, the DOE has the authority to order the temporary connection of 
facilities, or the generation or delivery of electricity, which it deems 
necessary to alleviate an emergency. Such orders shall be effective for 
the time specified and will be subject to the terms and conditions the 
DOE specifies. The DOE retains the right to cancel, modify or otherwise 
change any order, with or without notice, hearing, or report. Requests 
for action under these regulations will be accepted from any ``entity,'' 
State Public Utility Commission, State Energy Agency, or State Governor. 
Actions under these regulations also may be initiated by the DOE on its 
own motion. Orders under this authority may be made effective without 
prior notice.


<R05>
Sec. 205.371  Definition of emergency.

    ``Emergency,'' as used herein, is defined as an unexpected 
inadequate supply of electric energy which may result from the 
unexpected outage or breakdown of facilities for the generation, 
transmission or distribution of electric power. Such events may be the 
result of weather conditions, acts of God, or unforeseen occurrences not 
reasonably within the power of the affected ``entity'' to prevent. An 
emergency also can result from a sudden increase in customer demand, an 
inability to obtain adequate amounts of the necessary fuels to generate 
electricity, or a regulatory action which prohibits the use of certain 
electric power supply facilities. Actions under this authority are 
envisioned as meeting a specific inadequate power supply situation. 
Extended periods of insufficient power supply as a result of inadequate 
planning or the failure to construct necessary facilities can result in 
an emergency as contemplated in these regulations. In such cases, the 
impacted ``entity'' will be expected to make firm arrangements to 
resolve the problem until new facilities become available, so that a 
continuing emergency order is not needed. Situations where a shortage of 
electric energy is projected due solely to the failure of parties to 
agree to terms, conditions or other economic factors relating to 
service, generally will not be considered as emergencies unless the 
inability to supply electric service is imminent. Where an electricity 
outage or service inadequacy qualifies for a section 202(c) order, 
contractual difficulties alone will not be sufficient to preclude the 
issuance of an emergency order.


<R05>
Sec. 205.372  Filing procedures; number of copies.

    An original and two conformed copies of the applications and reports 
required under Secs. 205.370 through 205.379 shall be filed with the

<R05>
Sec. 205.374  Responses from ``entities'' designated in the application.

    Each ``entity'' designated as a potential source of emergency 
assistance or as a potential supplier of transmission services and which 
has received a copy of the application under Sec. 205.373, shall have 
three (3) calendar days from the time of receipt of the application to 
file the information designated below with the DOE. The DOE will grant 
extensions of the filing period when appropriate. The designated 
``entities'' shall provide an analysis of the impact the requested 
action would have on its system reliability and its ability to supply 
its own interruptible and firm customers. The effects of the requested 
action on the ability to serve firm loads shall be clearly distinguished 
from the ability to serve contractually interruptible loads. The 
designated ``entity'' also may provide other information relevant to the 
requested action, which is not included in the reliability analysis. 
Copies of any response shall be provided to the applicant, the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission, any State Regulatory Agency having 
responsibility for service standards or rates of any ``entity'' that may 
be directly involved in the proposed action, and the appropriate 
Regional Electric Reliability Council. Pursuant to section 202(c) of the 
Federal Power Act, DOE may issue an emergency order even though a 
designated ``entity'' has failed to file a timely response.


<R05>
Sec. 205.375  Guidelines defining inadequate fuel or energy supply.

    An inadequate utility system fuel inventory or energy supply is a 
matter of managerial and engineering judgment based on such factors as 
fuels in stock, fuels en route, transportation time, and constraints on 
available storage facilities. A system may be considered to have an 
inadequate fuel or energy supply capability when, combined with other 
conditions, the projected energy deficiency upon the applicant's system 
without emergency action by the DOE, will equal or exceed 10 percent of 
the applicant's then normal daily net energy for load, or will cause the 
applicant to be unable to meet its normal peak load requirements based 
upon use of all of its otherwise available resources so that it is 
unable to supply adequate electric service to its ultimate customers. 
The following conditions will be considered in determining that a system 
has inadequate fuel or energy supply capability:
    (1) System coal stocks are reduced to 30 days (or less) of normal 
burn days and a continued downward trend in stock is projected;
    (2) System residual oil stocks are reduced to 15 days (or less) of 
normal burn days and a continued downward trend in stocks is projected;
    (3) System distillate oil stocks which cannot be replaced by 
alternate fuels are reduced to 15 days (or less) of normal burn days and 
a continued downward trend in stocks is projected;
    (4) System natural gas deliveries which cannot be replaced by 
alternate fuels have been or will be reduced 20 percent below normal 
requirements and no improvement in natural gas deliveries is projected 
within 30 days;
    (5) Delays in nuclear fuel deliveries will extend a scheduled 
refueling shutdown by more than 30 days; and
    (6) Water supplies required for power generation have been reduced 
to the level where the future adequacy of the power supply may be 
endangered and no near term improvement in water supplies is projected.

The use of the prescribed criteria does not preclude an applicant from 
claiming the existence of an emergency when its stocks of fuel or water 
exceed the amounts and time frames specified above.


<R05>
Sec. 205.376  Rates and charges.

    The applicant and the generating or transmitting systems from which 
emergency service is requested are encouraged to utilize the rates and 
charges contained in approved existing rate schedules or to negotiate 
mutually satisfactory rates for the proposed

[[Page 47]]

transactions. In the event that the DOE determines that an emergency 
exists under section 202(c), and the ``entities'' are unable to agree on 
the rates to be charged, the DOE shall prescribe the conditions of 
service and refer the rate issues to the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission for determination by that agency in accordance with its 
standards and procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 205.377  Reports.

    In addition to the information specified below, the DOE may require 
additional reports as it deems necessary.
    (a) Where the DOE has authorized the temporary connection of 
transmission facilities, all ``entities'' whose transmission facilities 
are thus temporarily interconnected shall report the following 
information to the DOE within 15 days following completion of the 
interconnection:
    (1) The date the temporary interconnection was completed;
    (2) The location of the interconnection;
    (3) A description of the interconnection; and
    (4) A one-line electric diagram of the interconnection.
    (b) Where the DOE orders the transfer of power, the ``entity'' 
receiving such service shall report the following information to the DOE 
by the 10th of each month for the preceding month's activity for as long 
as such order shall remain in effect:
    (1) Amounts of capacity and/or energy received each day;
    (2) The name of the supplier;
    (3) The name of any ``entity'' supplying transmission services; and
    (4) Preliminary estimates of the associated costs.
    (c) Where the DOE has approved the installation of permanent 
facilities that will be used only during emergencies, any use of such 
facilities shall be reported to the DOE within 24 hours. Details of such 
usage shall be furnished as deemed appropriate by the DOE after such 
notification.
    (d) Any substantial change in the information provided under 
Sec. 205.373 shall be promptly reported to the DOE.

<R05>
Sec. 205.378  Disconnection of temporary facilities.

    Upon the termination of any emergency for the mitigation of which 
the DOE ordered the construction of temporary facilities, such 
facilities shall be disconnected and any temporary construction removed 
or otherwise disposed of, unless application is made as provided in 
Sec. 205.379 for permanent connection for emergency use. This 
disconnection and removal of temporary facilities shall be accomplished 
within 30 days of the termination of the emergency unless an extension 
is granted by the DOE. The DOE shall be notified promply when such 
removal of facilities is completed.


<R05>
Sec. 205.379  Application for approval of the installation of permanent facilities for emergency use only.

    Application for DOE approval of a permanent connection for emergency 
use only shall conform with the requirements in Sec. 205.373. However, 
the baseline data specified in Sec. 205.373(d) need not be included in 
an application made under this section. In addition, the application 
shall state in full the reasons why such permanent connection for 
emergency use is in the public interest.

Sec. 207.6  Notice of probable violation and remedial order.

    (a) Purpose and scope. (1) This section establishes the procedures 
for determining the nature and extent of violations of this subpart and 
the procedures for issuance of a notice of probable violation, a 
remedial order or a remedial order for immediate compliance.
    (2) When the DOE discovers that there is reason to believe a 
violation of any provision of this subpart, or any order issued 
thereunder, has occurred, is continuing or is about to occur, the DOE 
may conduct proceedings to determine the nature and extent of the 
violation and may issue a remedial order thereafter. The DOE may 
commence such proceeding by serving a notice of probable violation or by 
issuing a remedial order for immediate compliance.
    (b) Notice of probable violation. (1) The DOE may begin a proceeding 
under this subpart by issuing a notice of probable

[[Page 50]]

violation if the DOE has reason to believe that a violation has 
occurred, is continuing, or is about to occur.
    (2) Within 10 days of the service of a notice of probable violation, 
the person upon whom the notice is served may file a reply with the DOE 
office that issued the notice of probable violation at the address 
provided in Sec. 205.12 of this chapter. The DOE may extend the 10-day 
period for good cause shown.
    (3) The reply shall be in writing and signed by the person filing 
it. The reply shall contain a full and complete statement of all 
relevant facts pertaining to the act or transaction that is the subject 
of the notice of probable violation. Such facts shall include a complete 
statement of the business or other reasons that justify the act or 
transaction, it appropriate; a detailed description of the act or 
transaction; and a full discussion of the pertinent provisions and 
relevant facts reflected in any documents submitted with the reply. 
Copies of all relevant documents shall be submitted with the reply.
    (4) The reply shall include a discussion of all relevant 
authorities, including, but not limited to, DOE rulings, regulations, 
interpretations, and decisions on appeals and exceptions relied upon to 
support the particular position taken.
    (5) The reply should indicate whether the person requests or intends 
to request a conference regarding the notice. Any request not made at 
the time of the reply shall be made as soon thereafter as possible to 
insure that the conference is held when it will be most beneficial. A 
request for a conference must conform to the requirements of subpart M 
of part 205 of this chapter.
    (6) If a person has not filed a reply with the DOE within the 10-day 
period provided, and the DOE has not extended the 10-day period, the 
person shall be deemed to have conceded the accuracy of the factual 
allegations and legal conclusions stated in the notice of probable 
violation.
    (7) If the DOE finds, after the 10-day period provided in 
Sec. 207.6(b)(2), that no violation has occurred, is continuing, or is 
about to occur, or that for any reason the issuance of a remedial order 
would not be appropriate, it shall notify, in writing, the person to 
whom a notice of probable violation has been issued that the notice is 
rescinded.
    (c) Remedial order. (1) If the DOE finds, after the 10-day period 
provided in Sec. 207.6(b)(2), that a violation has occurred, is 
continuing, or is about to occur, the DOE may issue a remedial order. 
The order shall include a written opinion setting forth the relevant 
facts and the legal basis of the remedial order.
    (2) A remedial order issued under this subpart shall be effective 
upon issuance, in accordance with its terms, until stayed, suspended, 
modified or rescinded. The DOE may stay, suspend, modify or rescind a 
remedial order on its own initiative or upon application by the person 
to whom the remedial order is issued. Such action and application shall 
be in accordance with the procedures for such proceedings provided for 
in part 205 of this chapter.
    (3) A remedial order may be referred at any time to the Department 
of Justice for appropriate action in accordance with Sec. 207.7.
    (d) Remedial order for immediate compliance. (1) Notwithstanding 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the DOE may issue a remedial 
order for immediate compliance, which shall be effective upon issuance 
and until rescinded or suspended, if it finds:
    (i) There is a strong probability that a violation has occurred, is 
continuing or is about to occur;
    (ii) Irreparable harm will occur unless the violation is remedied 
immediately; and
    (iii) The public interest requires the avoidance of such irreparable 
harm through immediate compliance and waiver of the procedures afforded 
under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (2) A remedial order for immediate compliance shall be served 
promptly upon the person against whom such order is issued by telex or 
telegram, with a copy served by registered or certified mail. The copy 
shall contain a written statement of the relevant facts and the legal 
basis for the remedial order for immediate compliance, including the 
findings required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

[[Page 51]]

    (3) The DOE may rescind or suspend a remedial order for immediate 
compliance if it appears that the criteria set forth in paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section are no longer satisfied. When appropriate, however, such 
a suspension or rescission may be accompanied by a notice of probable 
violation issued under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (4) If at any time in the course of a proceeding commenced by a 
notice of probable violation the criteria set forth in paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section are satisfied, the DOE may issue a remedial order for 
immediate compliance, even if the 10-day period for reply specified in 
Sec. 207.6(b)(2) of this part has not expired.
    (5) At any time after a remedial order for immediate compliance has 
become effective the DOE may refer such order to the Department of 
Justice for appropriate action in accordance with Sec. 207.7 of this 
part.
    (e) Remedies. A remedial order or a remedial order for immediate 
compliance may require the person to whom it is directed to take such 
action as the DOE determines is necessary to eliminate or to compensate 
for the effects of a violation.
    (f) Appeal. (1) No notice of probable violation issued pursuant to 
this subpart shall be deemed to be an action of which there may be an 
administrative appeal.
    (2) Any person to whom a remedial order or a remedial order for 
immediate compliance is issued under this subpart may file an appeal 
with the DOE Office of Exceptions and Appeals in accordance with the 
procedures for such appeal provided in subpart H of part 205 of this 
chapter. The appeal must be filed within 10 days of service of the order 
from which the appeal is taken.


<R05>
Sec. 207.7  Sanctions.

    (a) General. (1) Penalties and sanctions shall be deemed cumulative 
and not mutually exclusive.
    (2) Each day that a violation of the provisions of this subpart or 
any order issued pursuant thereto continues shall be deemed to 
constitute a separate violation within the meaning of the provisions of 
this subpart relating to criminal fines and civil penalties.
    (b) Criminal penalties. Any person who willfully violates any 
provision of this subpart or any order issued pursuant thereto shall be 
subject to a fine of not more than $5,000 for each violation. Criminal 
violations are prosecuted by the Department of Justice upon referral by 
the DOE.
    (c) Civil Penalties. (1) Any person who violates any provision of 
this subpart or any order issued pursuant thereto shall be subject to a 
civil penalty of not more than $2,750 for each violation. Actions for 
civil penalties are prosecuted by the Department of Justice upon 
referral by the DOE.
    (2) When the DOE considers it to be appropriate or advisable, the 
DOE may compromise and settle, and collect civil penalties.

<R05>
Sec. 207.8  Judicial actions.

    (a) Enforcement of subpoenas; contempt. Any United States district 
court within the jurisdiction of which any inquiry is carried on may, 
upon petition by the Attorney General at the request of the 
Administrator, in the case of refusal to obey a subpoena or order of the 
Administrator issued under this subpart, issue an order requiring 
compliance. Any failure to obey such an order of the court may be 
punished by the court as contempt.
    (b) Injunctions. Whenever it appears to the Administrator that any 
person has engaged, is engaged, or is about to engage in any act or 
practice constituting a violation of any regulation or order issued 
under this subpart, the Administrator may request the Attorney General 
to bring a civil action in the appropriate district court of the United 
States to enjoin such acts or practices and, upon a proper showing, a 
temporary restraining order or preliminary or permanent injunction shall 
be granted without bond. The relief sought may include a mandatory 
injunction commanding any person to comply with any provision of such 
order or regulation, the violation of which is prohibited by section 
12(a) of ESECA, as implemented by this subpart.

    (c) Except where the Department of Energy otherwise provides, all 
records and transcripts prepared pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, shall be deposited within seven (7) days after the close 
of the week (ending Saturday) of their preparation during an 
international energy supply emergency or a test of the IEA emergency 
allocation system, and within fifteen (15) days after the close of the 
month of their preparation during periods of non-emergency, together 
with any agreement resulting therefrom, with the Department of Energy 
and shall be available to the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade 
Commission, and the Department of State. Such records and transcripts 
shall be available for public inspection and copying to the extent set 
forth in subpart D. Any person depositing materials pursuant to this 
section shall indicate with particularity what portions, if any, the 
person believes are not subject to disclosure to the public pursuant to

    (d) Any meeting between a participant and an official of DOE for the 
purpose of carrying out a voluntary agreement or developing or carrying 
out a plan of action shall, if not otherwise required to be recorded 
pursuant to this section, be recorded by such official as provided in 
Sec. 204.5.
    (e) During international oil allocation under chapters III and IV of 
the IEP or during an IEA allocation systems test, the Department of 
Energy may issue such additional guidelines amplifying the requirements

<R05>
Sec. 210.1  Records.

    (a) The recordkeeping requirements that were in effect on January 
27, 1981, in parts 210, 211, and 212 will remain in effect for (1) all 
transactions prior to February 1, 1981; and (2) all allowed expenses 
incurred and paid prior to April 1, 1981 under Sec. 212.78 of part 212. 
These requirements include, but are not limited to, the requirements 
that were in effect on January 27, 1981, in Sec. 210.92 of this part; in 
Secs. 211.67(a)(5)(ii); 211.89; 211.109, 211.127; and 211.223 of part 
211; and in Secs. 212.78(h)(5)(ii); 212.78(h)(6); 
212.83(c)(2)(iii)(E)(I); 212.83(c)(2)(iii)(E)(II); 212.83(c)(2)(iii); 
``F<INF>i</INF> t''; 212.83(i); 212.93(a); 212.93(b)(4)(iii)(B)(I); 
212.93(i)(4); 212.94(b)(2)(iii); 212.128; 212.132; 212.172; and 
Sec. 212.187 of part 212.
    (b) Effective February 5, 1985, paragraph (a) of this section shall 
apply, to the extent indicated, only to firms in the following 
categories. A firm may be included in more than one category, and a firm 
may move from one category to another. The fact that a firm becomes no 
longer subject to the recordkeeping requirements of one category shall 
not relieve that firm of compliance with the recordkeeping requirements 
of any other category in which the firm is still included.
    (1) Those firms which are or become parties in litigation with DOE, 
as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Any such firm shall 
remain subject to paragraph (a) of this section. DOE shall notify the 
firm in writing of the final resolution of the litigation and whether or 
not any of its records must be maintained for a further period. DOE 
shall notify a firm which must maintain any records for a further period 
when such records are no longer needed.
    (2)(i) Those firms which as of November 30 1984, have completed 
making all restitutionary payments required by an administrative or 
judicial order, consent order, or other settlement or order but which 
payments are on February 5, 1985, still subject to distribution by DOE. 
This requirement is applicable to only those firms listed in appendix B. 
Any such firm shall maintain all records for the time period covered by 
the administrative or judicial order, consent order, or other settlement 
or order requiring the payments, evidencing sales volume data for each 
product subject to controls and customers' names and addresses, until 
one of the following: June 30, 1985, unless this period is extended on a 
firm-by-firm basis; the end of the individual firm's extension; or the 
firm is notified in writing that its records are no longer needed.
    (ii) Those firms which as of November 30, 1984, are required to make 
restitutionary or other payments pursuant to an administrative or 
judicial order, consent order, or other settlement or order. Any such 
firm shall remain subject to paragraph (a) of this

[[Page 58]]

section until the firm completes all restitutionary payments required by 
the administrative or judicial order, consent order, or other settlement 
or order. However, after completing all such payments, a firm shall 
maintain all records described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section 
until one of the following: Six months after the firm completes all such 
payments, unless this period is extended on a firm-by-firm basis; the 
end of the individual firm's extension; or the firm is notified in 
writing that its records are no longer needed.
    (3)(i) Those firms with completed audits in which DOE has not yet 
made a determination to initiate a formal enforcement action and firms 
under audit which do not have outstanding subpoenas. Any such firm shall 
maintain all records for the period covered by the audit including all 
records necessary to establish historical prices or volumes which serve 
as the basis for determining the lawful prices or volumes for any 
subsequent regulated transaction which is subject to audit, until one of 
the following: June 30, 1985, unless this period is extended on a firm-
by-firm basis; the end of the individual firm's extension; or the firm 
is notified in writing by DOE that its records are no longer needed. 
However, if a firm in this group shall become a party in litigation, the 
firm shall then be subject to the recordkeeping requirements for firms 
in litigation set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Those firms under audit which have outstanding subpoenas on 
February 5, 1985, or which receive subpoenas at any time thereafter or 
which have supplied records for an audit as the result of a subpoena 
enforced after November 1, 1983. Any such firm shall remain subject to 
paragraph (a) of this section until two years after ERA has notified the 
firm in writing that is in full compliance with the subpoena or until 
ERA has received from the firm a sworn certification of compliance with 
the subpoena as required by 10 CFR 205.8. However, if a firm in this 
group shall become a party in litigation, the firm shall then be subject 
to the recordkeeping requirements for firms in litigation set forth in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (4) Those firms which are subject to requests for data necessary to 
verify that crude oil qualifies as ``newly discovered'' crude oil under 
10 CFR 212.79. Any such firm shall maintain the records evidencing such 
data until one of the following: June 30, 1985, unless this period is 
extended on a firm-by-firm basis; the end of an individual firm's 
extension; or the firm is notified in writing by DOE that its records 
are no longer needed. However, if a firm in this group shall become a 
party in litigation, the firm shall then be subject to the recordkeeping 
requirements for firms in litigation set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section.
    (5) Those firms whose records are determined by DOE as necessary to 
complete the enforcement activity relating to another firm which is also 
subject to paragraph (a) of this section unless such firms required to 
keep records have received certified notice letters specifically 
describing the records determined as necessary. At that time, the 
specific notice will control the recordkeeping requirements. These firms 
have been identified in appendix A. Any such firm shall maintain these 
records until one of the following: June 30, 1985, unless this period is 
extended on a firm-by-firm basis; the end of the individual firm's 
extension; or the firm is notified in writing by DOE that its records 
are no longer needed.
    (6) Those firms which participated in the Entitlements program. Any 
such firm shall maintain its Entitlements-related records until six 
months after the final judicial resolution (including any and all 
appeals) of Texaco v. DOE, Nos. 84-391, 84-410, and 84-456 (D. Del.), or 
the firm is notified by DOE that its records are no longer needed, 
whichever occurs first.
    (c) For purposes of this section:
    (1) A firm is ``a party in litigation'' if:
    (i)(A) The firm has received a Notice of Probable Violation, a 
Notice of Probable Disallowance, a Proposed Remedial Order, or a 
Proposed Order of Disallowance; or
    (B) The firm and DOE are parties in a lawsuit arising under the 
Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, as amended (15 U.S.C. 751 et 
seq.) or 10 CFR parts 205, 210, 211, or 212; and

[[Page 59]]

    (ii)(A) There has been no final (that is, non-appealable) 
administrative or judicial resolution, or
    (B) DOE has not informed the firm in writing that the Department has 
completed its review of the matter.
    (2) A firm means any association, company, corporation, estate, 
individual, joint-venture, partnership, or sole proprietorship, or any 
other entity, however organized, including charitable, educational, or 
other eleemosynary institutions, and state and local governments. A firm 
includes a parent and the consolidated and unconsolidated entities (if 
any) which it directly or indirectly controls.

<R05>
Sec. 216.1  Introduction.

    (a) This part describes and establishes the procedures to be used by 
the Department of Energy (``DOE'') in considering and making certain 
findings required by section 101(c)(3) of the Defense Production Act of 
1950, as amended, 50 U.S.C. App. 2071(c)(3) (``DPA''). Section 101(c) 
authorizes the allocation of, or priority performance under contracts or 
orders (other than contracts of employment) relating to, supplies of 
materials and equipment in order to maximize domestic energy supplies if 
the findings described in section 101(c)(3) are made. Among these 
findings are that such supplies of materials and equipment are critical 
and essential to maintain or further exploration, production, refining, 
transportation or the conservation of energy supplies or for the 
construction and maintenance of energy facilities. The function of 
finding if such supplies are critical and essential was delegated to the 
Administrator of the Department of Energy (``DOE'') pursuant to 
Executive Order

[[Page 67]]

11912 of April 13, 1976, Defense Mobilization Order (``DMO'') No. 13 
dated September 22, 1976, 41 FR 43720, and Department of Commerce, 
Bureau of Domestic Commerce, Delegation No. 4, effective date December 
1, 1976, 41 FR 52331. Delegation No. 4 was superseded by Defense 
Priorities and Allocations System Delegation No. 2, effective date 
August 29, 1984, 49 FR 30430. On October 1, 1977, pursuant to section 
301(a) of the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. 95-91), all 
of the functions of DOE and all of the functions of the DOE 
Administrator were transferred to the Secretary of Energy.
    (b) The purpose of these regulations is to establish the procedures 
and the criteria to be used by DOE in determining whether programs or 
projects maximize domestic energy supplies and finding whether or not 
supplies of material and equipment are critical and essential, as 
required by DPA section 101(c)(3). The critical and essential finding 
will be made only for supplies of materials and equipment related to 
those programs or projects determined by DOE to maximize domestic energy 
supplies. These regulations do not require or imply that the findings, 
on which the exercise of such authority is conditioned, will be made in 
any particular case.
    (c) If DOE determines that a program or project maximizes domestic 
energy supplies and finds that supplies of materials and equipment are 
critical and essential to maintain or further the exploration, 
production, refining, transportation or conservation of energy supplies 
or for the construction and maintenance of energy facilities, such 
determination and finding will be communicated to the Department of 
Commerce. If not, the applicant will be so informed. If the 
determination and finding described above are made, the Department of 
Commerce, pursuant to DPA section 101(c), Executive Order 11912 and DMO 
No. 13, will find whether or not (1) the supplies of materials and 
equipment in question are scarce and (2) maintenance or furtherance of 
exploration, production, refining, transportation, or conservation of 
energy supplies or the construction and maintenance of energy facilities 
cannot be reasonably accomplished without exercising the authority 
specified in section 101(c). If these additional two findings are made, 
the Department of Commerce will notify DOE, and DOE will inform the 
applicant that it has been granted the right to use priority ratings 
under the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (``DPAS'') 
regulation established by the Department of Commerce, 15 CFR 350.

believes is relevant to the discharge of its functions pursuant to DPA 
section 101(c).

[43 FR 6212, Feb. 14, 1978, as amended at 51 FR 8311, Mar. 11, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 216.4  Evaluation by DOE of applications.

    (a) Based on the information provided by the applicant and other 
available information, DOE will assess the application and (1) determine 
whether or not the energy program or project in connection with which 
the application is made maximizes domestic energy supplies and should be 
designated an eligible energy program or project and (2) find whether 
the described supplies of materials and equipment are critical

[[Page 69]]

and essential to the eligible energy program or project.
    (b) In determining whether the program or project referred to in the 
application should be designated an eligible energy program or project, 
DOE will consider all factors which it considers relevant including, but 
not limited to, the following:
    (1) Quantity of energy involved;
    (2) Benefits of timely energy program furtherance or project 
completion;
    (3) Socioeconomic impact;
    (4) The need for the end product for which the materials and 
equipment are allegedly required; and
    (5) Established national energy policies.
    (c) In findings whether the supplies of materials or equipment 
described in the application are critical and essential to an eligible 
energy program or project, DOE will consider all factors which it 
considers relevant including, but not limited to, the following:
    (1) Availability and utility of substitute materials or equipment; 
and
    (2) Impact of the nonavailability of the specific supplies of 
materials and equipment on the furtherance or timely completion of the 
approved energy program or project.
    (d) Increased costs which may be associated with obtaining materials 
or equipment without assistance shall not be considered a valid reason 
for finding the materials and equipment to be critical and essential.
    (e) After DOE has determined a program or project to be an eligible 
energy program or project, this determination shall be deemed made with 
regard to subsequent applications involving the same program or project 
unless and until DOE announces otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 216.5  Notification of findings.

    (a) DOE will notify the DOC if it finds that supplies of materials 
and equipment, for which an applicant requested assistance, are critical 
and essential to an eligible energy program or project, and in such 
cases will forward to the DOC the application and whatever information 
or comments DOE believes appropriate. If DOE believes at any time that 
findings previously made may no longer be valid, it will immediately 
notify the DOC and the affected applicant(s) and afford such 
applicant(s) an opportunity to show cause why such findings should not 
be withdrawn.
    (b) If DOC notifies DOE that DOC has found that supplies of 
materials and equipment, for which the applicant requested assistance, 
are scarce and that the related eligible energy program or project 
cannot reasonably be accomplished without exercising the authority 
specified in DPA section 101(c)(1), DOE will notify the applicant that 
the applicant is authorized to place rated orders and/or authorized 
controlled material orders for specific supplies of materials and 
equipment pursuant to the provisions of the DPAS Regulation, as 
promulgated by the Department of Commerce.

[43 FR 6212, Feb. 14, 1978, as amended at 51 FR 8312, Mar. 11, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 216.6  Petition for reconsideration.

    If DOE, after evaluating an application in accordance with 
Sec. 216.4, does not determine that the energy program or project 
maximizes domestic energy supplies or does not find that the supplies of 
materials and equipment described in the application are critical and 
essential to an eligible energy program or project, it will so notify 
the applicant and the applicant may petition DOE for reconsideration. If 
DOE concludes at any time that findings previously made are no longer 
valid and should be withdrawn, DOE will so notify the affected 
applicant(s), and such applicant(s) may petition DOE for reconsideration 
of the withdrawal decision. Such a petition is deemed accepted when 
received by DOE at the address stated in Sec. 216.8. DOE will consider 
the petition for reconsideration and either grant or deny the relief 
requested. Written notice of the decision and of the reasons for the 
decision will be provided to the applicant. There has not been an 
exhaustion of administrative remedies until a petition for 
reconsideration has been submitted and the review procedure completed by 
grant or denial of the relief requested.

[[Page 70]]

The denial of relief requested in a petition for reconsideration is a 
final administrative decision.

[43 FR 6212, Feb. 14, 1978, as amended at 51 FR 8312, Mar. 11, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 216.7  Conflict in priority orders.

    If it appears that the use of assistance pursuant to DPA section 
101(c) creates or threatens to create a conflict with priorities and 
allocation support provided in connection with the national defense 
pursuant to DPA section 101(a), DOE will work with the DOC and other 
claimant agencies affected by such conflict in an attempt to reschedule 
deliveries or otherwise accommodate such competing demands. If

application for review is a summary proceeding which will be initiated 
only if the critieria described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section are 
satisfied.
    (b) What to file. (1) A firm filing under this subpart shall file an 
``Application for Review'' which should be clearly labeled as such both 
on the application and on the outside of the envelope in which the 
application is transmitted, and shall be in writing and signed by the 
firm filing the application. The applicant shall comply with the general 
filing requirements stated in 10 CFR 205.9 in addition to the 
requirements stated in this section.
    (2) If the applicant wishes to claim confidential treatment for any 
information contained in the application or other documents submitted 
under this

[[Page 73]]

subpart, the procedures set out in 10 CFR 205.9(f) shall apply.
    (c) When to file. An application for review should be filed no later 
than 5 days after the receipt by the applicant of the supply order that 
is the subject of the application, or no later than 2 days after the 
occurrence of an event that results in a substantial change in the facts 
or circumstances affecting the applicant.
    (d) Where to file. The application for review shall be filed with 
DOE Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), 2000 M Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20461.
    (e) Notice. The applicant shall send by United States mail or 
deliver by hand a copy of the application and any subsequent amendments 
or other documents relating to the application to the Administrator of 
the Economic Regulatory Administration of DOE, 2000 M Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20461. Service shall be made on the ERA at same time the 
document is filed with OHA and each document filed with the OHA shall 
include certification that the applicant has complied with the 
requirements of this paragraph.
    (f) Contents. (1) The application shall contain a full and complete 
statement of all relevant facts pertaining to the application and to the 
DOE action sought. Such facts shall include a complete statement of the 
business or other reasons that justify review of the supply order and a 
full description of the pertinent provisions and relevant facts 
contained in any relevant documents. Copies of all contracts, 
agreements, leases, instruments, and other documents relevant to the 
application shall be submitted with the application. A copy of the order 
of which review is sought shall be included with the application. When 
the application pertains to only one step of a larger integrated 
transaction, the facts, circumstances, and other relevant information 
pertaining to the entire transaction shall be submitted.
    (2) The application shall include a discussion of all relevant 
authorities, including, but not limited to, DOE and DOE rulings, 
regulations, interpretations and decisions on appeal and exception 
relied upon to support the action sought therein.
    (g) DOE evaluation--(1) Processing. (i) The DOE may initiate an 
investigation of any statement in an application and utilize in its 
evaluation any relevant facts obtained by such investigation. The DOE 
may solicit and accept submissions from third parties relevant to any 
application for review provided that the applicant is afforded an 
opportunity to respond to all third party submissions. In evaluating an 
application for review, the DOE may convene a conference, on its own 
initiative, if, in its discretion, it considers that a conference will 
advance its evaluation of the application.
    (ii) If the DOE determines that there is insufficient information 
upon which to base a decision and if upon request the necessary 
additional information is not submitted, the DOE may dismiss the 
application without prejudice. If the failure to supply additional 
information is repeated or willful, the DOE may dismiss the application 
with prejudice. If the applicant fails to provide the notice required by 
paragraph (e) of this section, the DOE may dismiss the application 
without prejudice.
    (iii) An order dismissing an application for any of the reasons 
specified in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section shall contain a 
statement of the grounds for the dismissal. The order shall become final 
within 5 days of its service upon the applicant, unless within such 5-
day period the applicant files an amendment correcting the deficiencies 
identified in the order. Within 5 days of the filing of such amendment, 
the DOE shall notify the applicant whether the amendment corrects the 
specified deficiencies. If the amendment does not correct the 
deficiencies specified in the order, the order shall become a final 
order of the DOE of which the applicant may seek judicial review.
    (2) An application for review of an order shall be processed only if 
the applicant demonstrates that--
    (i) There is probable cause to believe that the supply order is 
erroneous, inequitable, or unduly burdensome; or
    (ii) There has been discovered a law, regulation, interpretation, 
ruling, order or decision that was in effect at the time of the 
application which, if it had been made known to the DOE, would have been 
relevant to the supply

[[Page 74]]

order and would have substantially altered the supply order; or
    (iii) There has been a substantial change in the facts or 
circumstances affecting the applicant, which change has occurred during 
the interval between issuance of the supply order and the date of the 
application and was caused by forces or circumstances beyond the control 
of the applicant.
    (h) Decision. (1) Upon consideration of the application and other 
relevant information received or obtained during the proceeding, the DOE 
shall issue an order granting or denying the modification or rescission 
of the supply order requested in the application for review.
    (2) The DOE shall process applications for review as expeditiously 
as possible. When administratively feasible, the DOE shall issue an 
order granting or denying the application within 20 business days after 
receipt of the application.
    (3) The order shall include a written statement setting forth the 
relevant facts and the legal basis of the order. The order shall state 
that it is a final order of which the applicant may seek judicial 
review.

any other party who participated in the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 218.33  Stay.

    (a) The DOE may issue an order granting a stay if the DOE determines 
that an applicant has made a compelling showing that it would incur 
serious and irreparable injury unless immediate stay relief is granted 
pending determination of an application for review pursuant to this 
subpart. An application for a stay shall be labeled as such on the 
application and on the outside of the envelope in which the application 
is transmitted, and shall be in writing and signed by the firm filing 
the application. It shall include a description of the proceeding 
incident to which the stay is being sought and of the facts and 
circumstances which support the applicant's claim that it will incur 
irreparable injury unless immediate stay relief is granted. The 
applicant shall comply with the general filing requirements stated in 10 
CFR 205.9 in addition to the requirements stated in this section. The 
DOE on its own initiative may also issue an order granting a stay upon a 
finding that a firm will incur irreparable injury if such an order is 
not granted.
    (b) An order granting a stay shall expire by its terms within such 
time after issuance, not to exceed 30 days as the DOE specifies in the 
order, except that it shall expire automatically 5 days following its 
issuance if the applicant fails within that period to file an 
application for review unless within that period the DOE for good cause 
shown, extends the time during which the applicant may file an 
application for review.
    (c) The order granting or denying a stay is not an order of the DOE 
subject to administrative review.


<R05>

petroleum product and the reasons, if known, why the suppliers will not 
supply the requested crude oil or petroleum product;
    (5) The degree to which it is feasible for DOD to use an alternate 
product in lieu of that requested and, if such an alternative product 
can be used, the efforts which have been made to obtain the alternate 
product;
    (6) The period during which the shortage of crude oil or petroleum 
products is expected to exist;
    (7) The proposed supply source for the additional crude oil or

    (a) Upon receipt of a request from DOD for a priority rating as 
provided in Sec. 221.31, it shall be reviewed promptly by ERA. The ERA 
will assess the request in terms of:
    (1) The information provided under Sec. 221.31;
    (2) Whether DOD's national defense needs for crude oil or petroleum 
products can reasonably be satisfied without exercising the authority 
specified in this part;

request for a priority rating specified under this part. The proposed 
supplier shall have a period specified in the notice, not to exceed 
fifteen (15) days from the date it is notified of DOD's request, to show 
cause in writing why it cannot supply the requested quantity and quality 
of crude oil or petroleum products. ERA shall consider this information 
in determining whether to issue the priority rating.
    (c) If acceptance by a supplier of a rated order would create a 
conflict with another rated order of the supplier, it shall include all 
pertinent information regarding such conflict in its response to the 
show cause order provided for in subsection (b), and ERA, in 
consultation with DOD and the Federal Emergency Management Agency shall

[[Page 78]]

determine the priorities for meeting all such requirements.
    (d) ERA may waive some or all of the requirements of Sec. 221.31 or 
this section where the Secretary of Defense or his designee certifies, 
and has so notified the Federal Emergency Management Agency, that a fuel 
shortage for DOD exists or is imminent and that compliance with such 
requirements would have a substantial negative impact on the national 
defense.


<R05>
Sec. 221.33  Order.

    (a) Issuance. If ERA determines that issuance of a priority rating 
for a crude oil or refined petroleum product is necessary to provide the 
crude oil or petroleum products needed to meet the national defense 
requirement established by DOD, it shall issue such a rating to DOD for 
delivery of specified qualities and quantities of the crude oil or 
refined petroleum products on or during specified delivery dates or 
periods. In accordance with the terms of the order, DOD may then place 
such priority rating on a supply order.
    (b) Compliance. Each person who receives a priority-rated supply 
order pursuant to this part shall supply the specified crude oil or 
petroleum products to DOD in accordance with the terms of that order.
    (c) ERA directives. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this 
part, where necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense ERA 
is authorized to issue a directive to a supplier of crude oil or 
petroleum product requiring delivery of specified qualities and 
quantities of such crude oil or petroleum products to DOD at or during 
specified delivery dates or periods.
    (d) Use of ratings by suppliers. No supplier who receives a 
priority-rated supply order or directive issued under the authority of 
this section may use such priority order or directive in order to obtain 
materials necessary to meet its supply obligations thereunder.


<R05>
Sec. 221.34  Effect of order.

    Defense against claims for damages. No person shall be liable for 
damages or penalties for any act or failure to act resulting directly or 
indirectly from compliance with any ERA authorized priority-rated supply 
order or ERA directive issued pursuant to this part, notwithstanding 
that such priority-rated supply order or directive thereafter be 
declared by judicial or other competent authority to be invalid.


<R05>
Sec. 221.35  Contractual requirements.

    (a) No supplier may discriminate against an order or contract on 
which a priority rating has been placed under this part by charging 
higher prices, by imposing terms and conditions for such orders or 
contracts different from other generally comparable orders or contracts, 
or by any other means.
    (b) Contracts with priority ratings shall be subject to all 
applicable laws and regulations which govern the making of such 
contracts, including those specified in 10 CFR 211.26(e).


<R05>
Sec. 221.36  Records and reports.

    (a) Each person receiving an order or directive under this part 
shall keep for at least two years from the date of full compliance with 
such order or directive accurate and complete records of crude oil and 
petroleum product deliveries made in accordance with such order or 
directive.
    (b) All records required to be maintained shall be made available

determining measures of energy consumption under paragraphs (m)(2)(ii) 
and (m)(4) of this section must either subject a sample of their units 
to independent testing on a regular basis, e.g., voluntary certification 
program, or have the representations reviewed and certified by an 
independent state-registered professional engineer who is not an 
employee of the manufacturer. The registered professional engineer is to 
certify that the results of the alternative rating procedure accurately 
represent the energy consumption of the unit(s). The manufacturer is to 
keep the registered professional engineer's certifications on file for 
review by DOE for as long as said combination is made available for sale 
by the manufacturer. Any change to be made to the alternative rating 
method, must be approved by DOE prior to its use for rating.

    (a)(1) Any interested person may submit a petition to waive for a 
particular basic model any requirements of Sec. 430.23, or of any 
appendix to this subpart, upon the grounds that the basic model contains 
one or more design characteristics which either prevent testing of the 
basic model according to the prescribed test procedures, or the 
prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner so 
unrepresentative of its true energy consumption characteristics, or 
water consumption characteristics (in the case of faucets, showerheads, 
water closets, and urinals) as to provide materially inaccurate 
comparative data.
    (2) Any interested person who has submitted a Petition for Waiver as 
provided in this subpart may also file an Application for Interim Waiver 
of the applicable test procedure requirements.
    (b)(1) A Petition for Waiver shall be submitted, in triplicate, to 
the Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energy, United 
States Department of Energy. Each Petition for Waiver shall:
    (i) Identify the particular basic model(s) for which a waiver is 
requested, the design characteristic(s) constituting the grounds for the 
petition, and the specific requirements sought to be waived and shall 
discuss in detail the need for the requested waiver;
    (ii) Identify manufacturers of all other basic models marketed in 
the United States and known to the petitioner to incorporate similar 
design characteristic(s);
    (iii) Include any alternate test procedures known to the petitioner 
to evaluate in a manner representative of the energy consumption 
characteristics, or water consumption characteristics (in the case of 
faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals) of the basic model; 
and
    (iv) Be signed by the petitioner or by an authorized representative. 
In accordance with the provisions set forth in 10 CFR 1004.11, any

for noncompliance with any requirements of this subpart, until a waiver 
or interim waiver has been granted.
    (l) Waivers will be granted by the Assistant Secretary for 
Conservation and Renewable Energy, if it is determined that the basic 
model for which the waiver was requested contains a design 
characteristic which either prevents testing of the basic model 
according to the prescribed test procedures, or the prescribed test 
procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner so unrepresentative 
of its true energy consumption characteristics, or water consumption 
characteristics (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and 
urinals) as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers 
may be granted subject to conditions, which may include adherence to 
alternate test procedures specified by the Assistant Secretary for 
Conservation and Renewable Energy. The Assistant Secretary shall consult 
with the Federal Trade Commission prior to granting any waiver, and 
shall promptly publish in the Federal Register notice of each waiver 
granted or denied, and any limiting conditions of each waiver granted.
    (m) Within one year of the granting of any waiver, the Department of 
Energy will publish in the Federal Register a notice of proposed 
rulemaking to amend its regulations so as to eliminate any need for the 
continuation of such waiver. As soon thereafter as practicable, the 
Department of Energy will publish in the Federal Register a final rule. 
Such waiver will terminate on the effective date of such final rule.
    (n) In order to exhaust administrative remedies, any person 
aggrieved by an action under this section must file an appeal with the 
DOE's Office of Hearings and Appeals as provided in 10 CFR part 1003, 
subpart C.

     the Energy Consumption of Electric Refrigerators and Electric 
                          Refrigerator-Freezers

                             1. Definitions

    1.1  ``HRF-1-1979'' means the Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers standard for household refrigerators, combination 
refrigerator-freezers, and household freezers, also approved as an 
American National Standard as a revision of ANSI B 38.1-1970.
    1.2  ``Adjusted total volume'' means the sum of (i) the fresh food 
compartment volume as defined in HRF-1-1979 in cubic feet, and (ii) the 
product of an adjustment factor and the net freezer compartment volume 
as defined in HRF-1-1979, in cubic feet.
    1.3  ``Anti-sweat heater'' means a device incorporated into the 
design of a refrigerator or refrigerator-freezer to prevent the 
accumulation of moisture on exterior surfaces of the cabinet under 
conditions of high ambient humidity.
    1.4  ``All-refrigerator'' means an electric refrigerator which does 
not include a compartment for the freezing and long time storage of food 
at temperatures below 32  deg.F. (0.0  deg.C.). It may include a 
compartment of 0.50 cubic feet capacity (14.2 liters) or less for the 
freezing and storage of ice.
    1.5  ``Cycle'' means the period of 24 hours for which the energy use 
of an electric refrigerator or electric refrigerator-freezer is 
calculated as though the consumer activated compartment temperature 
controls were set

[[Page 129]]

so that the desired compartment temperatures were maintained.
    1.6  ``Cycle type'' means the set of test conditions having the 
calculated effect of operating an electric refrigerator or electric 
refrigerator-freezer for a period of 24 hours, with the consumer 
activated controls other than those that control compartment 
temperatures set to establish various operating characteristics.
    1.7  ``Standard cycle'' means the cycle type in which the anti-sweat 
heater control, when provided, is set in the highest energy consuming 
position.
    1.8  ``Automatic defrost'' means a system in which the defrost cycle 
is automatically initiated and terminated, with resumption of normal 
refrigeration at the conclusion of the defrost operation. The system 
automatically prevents the permanent formation of frost on all 
refrigerated surfaces. Nominal refrigerated food temperatures are

system where successive defrost cycles are separated by 14 hours or more 
of compressor-operating time.
    1.10  ``Stabilization Period'' means the total period of time during 
which steady-state conditions are being attained or evaluated.
    1.11  ``Variable defrost control'' means a long-time automatic 
defrost system (except the 14-hour defrost qualification does not apply) 
where successive defrost cycles are determined by an operating condition 
variable or variables other than solely compressor operating time. This 
includes any electrical or mechanical device. Demand defrost is a type 
of variable defrost control.
    1.12  ``Externally vented refrigerator or refrigerator-freezer'' 
means an electric refrigerator or electric refrigerator-freezer that: 
has an enclosed condenser or an enclosed condenser/compressor 
compartment and a set of air ducts for transferring the exterior air 
from outside the building envelope into, through and out of the 
refrigerator or refrigerator-freezer cabinet; is capable of mixing 
exterior air with the room air before discharging into, through, and out 
of the condenser or condenser/compressor compartment; includes 
thermostatically controlled dampers or controls that enable the mixing 
of the exterior and room air at low outdoor temperatures, and the 
exclusion of exterior air when the outdoor air temperature is above 80 
deg.F or the room air temperature; and may have a thermostatically 
actuated exterior air fan.

                           2. Test Conditions

    2.1  Ambient temperature. The ambient temperature shall be 90.0 
<plus-minus> 1  deg.F. (32.3<plus-minus>0.6  deg.C.) during the 
stabilization period and during the test period. The ambient temperature 
shall be 80<plus-minus>2  deg.F dry bulb and 67  deg.F wet bulb during 
the stabilization period and during the test period when the unit is 
tested in accordance with section 3.3.
    2.2  Operational conditions. The electric refrigerator or electric 
refrigerator-freezer shall be installed and its operating conditions 
maintained in accordance with HRF-1-1979, section 7.2 through section 
7.4.3.3, except that the vertical ambient temperature gradient at 
locations 10 inches (25.4 cm) out from the centers of the two sides of 
the unit being tested is to be maintained during the test. Unless the 
area is obstructed by shields or baffles, the gradient is to be 
maintained from 2 inches (5.1 cm) above the floor or supporting platform 
to a height one foot (30.5 cm) above the unit under test. Defrost 
controls are to be operative and the anti-sweat heater switch is to be 
``on'' during one test and ``off'' during a second test. Other 
exceptions are noted in 2.3, 2.4, and 5.1 below.
    2.3  Conditions for automatic defrost refrigerator-freezers. For 
automatic defrost refrigerator-freezers, the freezer compartments shall 
not be loaded with any frozen food packages. Cylindrical metallic masses 
of dimensions 1.12<plus-minus>0.25 inches (2.9<plus-minus>0.6 cm) in 
diameter and height shall be attached in good thermal contact with each 
temperature sensor within the refrigerated compartments. All temperature 
measuring sensor masses shall be supported by nonthermally conductive 
supports in such a manner that there will be at least one inch (2.5 cm) 
of air space separating the thermal mass from contact with any surface. 
In case of interference with hardware at the sensor locations specified 
in section 5.1, the sensors shall be placed at the nearest adjacent 
location such that there will be a one inch air space separating the 
sensor mass from the hardware.
    2.4  Conditions for all-refrigerators. There shall be no load in the 
freezer compartment during the test.
    2.5  Steady State Condition. Steady state conditions exist if the 
temperature measurements in all measured compartments taken at four 
minute intervals or less during a stabilization period are not changing 
at a rate greater than 0.042  deg.F. (0.023  deg.C.) per hour as 
determined by the applicable condition of A or B.
    A. The average of the measurements during a two hour period if no 
cycling occurs or during a number of complete repetitive compressor 
cycles through a period of no less than two hours is compare to the 
average over an equivalent time period with three hours elapsed between 
the two measurement periods.
    B. If A above cannot be used, the average of the measurements during 
a number of complete repetitive compressor cycles through a period of no 
less than two hours and including the last complete cycle prior to a 
defrost period, or if no cycling occurs,

[[Page 130]]

the average of the measurements during the last two hours prior to a 
defrost period; are compared to the same averaging period prior to the 
following defrost period.
    2.6  Exterior air for externally vented refrigerator or 
refrigerator-freezer. An exterior air source shall be provided with 
adjustable temperature and pressure capabilities. The exterior air 
temperature shall be adjustable from 35<plus-minus>1  deg.F 
(1.7<plus-minus>0.6  deg.C) to 90<plus-minus>1  deg.F 
(32.2<plus-minus>0.6  deg.C).
    2.6.1  Air duct. The exterior air shall pass from the exterior air 
source to the test unit through an insulated air duct.
    2.6.2  Air temperature measurement. The air temperature entering the 
condenser or condenser/compressor compartment shall be maintained to 
<plus-minus>3  deg.F (1.7  deg.C) during the stabilization and test 
periods and shall be measured at the inlet point of the condenser or 
condenser/compressor compartment (``condenser inlet''). Temperature 
measurements shall be taken from at least three temperature sensors or 
one sensor per 4 square inches of the air duct cross sectional area, 
whichever is greater, and shall be averaged. For a unit that has a 
condenser air fan, a minimum of three temperature sensors at the 
condenser fan discharge shall be required. Temperature sensors shall be 
arranged to be at the centers of equally divided cross sectional areas. 
The exterior air temperature, at its source, shall be measured and 
maintained to <plus-minus>1  deg.F (0.6  deg.C) during the test period. 
The temperature measuring devices shall have an error not greater than 
<plus-minus>0.5  deg.F (<plus-minus>0.3  deg.C). Measurements of the air 
temperature during the test period shall be taken at regular intervals 
not to exceed four minutes.
    2.6.3  Exterior air static pressure. The exterior air static 
pressure at the inlet point of the unit shall be adjusted to maintain a 
negative pressure of 0.20<gr-thn-eq><plus-minus>0.05<gr-thn-eq> water 
column (62 Pa<plus-minus>12.5 Pa) for all air flow rates supplied to the 
unit. The pressure sensor shall be located on a straight duct with a 
distance of at least 7.5 times the diameter of the duct upstream and a 
distance of at least 3 times the diameter of the duct downstream. There 
shall be four static pressure taps at 90 deg.angles apart. The four 
pressures shall be averaged by interconnecting the four pressure taps. 
The air pressure measuring instrument shall have an error not greater 
than 0.01<gr-thn-eq> water column (2.5 Pa).

                        3. Test Control Settings

    3.1  Model with no user operable temperature control. A test shall 
be performed during which the compartment temperatures and energy use 
shall be measured. A second test shall be performed with the temperature 
control electrically short circuited to cause the compressor to run 
continuously.
    3.2  Model with user operable temperature control. Testing shall be 
performed in accordance with one of the following sections using the 
standardized temperatures of:

All-refrigerator: 38  deg.F. (3.3  deg.C.) fresh food compartment 
temperature
Refrigerator: 15  deg.F. (-9.4  deg.C.) freezer compartment temperature
Refrigerator-freezer: 5  deg.F. (-15  deg.C.) freezer compartment 
temperature
Variable defrost control models: 5  deg.F (-15  deg.C) freezer 
compartment temperature and 38 <plus-minus>2  deg.F fresh food 
compartment temperature during steady-state conditions with no door-
openings. If both settings cannot be obtained, then test with the fresh 
food compartment temperature at 38<plus-minus>2  deg.F and the freezer 
compartment as close to 5  deg.F as possible.

    3.2.1  A first test shall be performed with all compartment 
temperature controls set at their median position midway between their 
warmest and coldest settings. Knob detents shall be mechanically 
defeated if necessary to attain a median setting. A second test shall be 
performed with all controls set at either their warmest or their coldest 
setting (not electrically or mechanically bypassed), whichever is 
appropriate, to attempt to achieve compartment temperatures measured 
during the two tests which bound (i.e., one is above and one is below) 
the standardized temperature for the type of product being tested. If 
the compartment temperatures measured during these two tests bound the 
appropriate standardized temperature, then these test results shall be 
used to determine energy consumption. If the compartment temperature 
measured with all controls set at their coldest setting is above the 
standardized temperature, a third test shall be performed with all 
controls set at their warmest setting and the result of this test shall 
be used with the result of the test performed with all controls set at 
their coldest setting to determine energy consumption. If the 
compartment temperature measured with all controls set at their warmest 
setting is below the standardized temperature; and the fresh food 
compartment temperature is below 45  deg.F. (7.22  deg.C.) in the case 
of a refrigerator or a refrigerator-freezer, excluding an all-
refrigerator, then the result of this test alone will be used to 
determine energy consumption.
    3.2.2  Alternatively, a first test may be performed with all 
temperature controls set at their warmest setting. If the compartment 
temperature is below the appropriate standardized temperature, and the 
fresh food compartment temperature is below 45  deg.F. (7.22  deg.C.) in 
the case of a refrigerator or a refrigerator-freezer, excluding an all-
refrigerator, then the result of this test alone will be used to 
determine energy consumption. If the above conditions are not met, then 
the unit shall be tested in accordance with 3.2.1 above.

[[Page 131]]

    3.2.3  Alternatively, a first test may be performed with all 
temperature controls set at their coldest setting. If the compartment 
temperature is above the appropriate standardized temperature, a second 
test shall be performed with all controls set at their warmest control 
setting and the results of these two tests shall be used to determine 
energy consumption. If the above condition is not met, then the unit 
shall be tested in accordance with 3.2.1 above.
    3.3  Variable defrost control optional test. After a steady-state 
condition is achieved, the optional test requires door-openings for 
12<plus-minus>2 seconds every 60 minutes on the fresh food compartment 
door and a simultaneous 12<plus-minus>2 second freezer compartment door-
opening occurring every 4th time, to obtain 24 fresh food and six 
freezer compartment door-openings per 24-hour period. The first freezer 
door-opening shall be simultaneous with the fourth fresh food door-
opening. The doors are to be opened 60 deg. to 90 deg.with an average 
velocity for the leading edge of the door of approximately 2 ft./sec. 
Prior to the initiation of the door-opening sequence, the refrigerator 
defrost control mechanism may be re-initiated in order to minimize the 
test duration.

                             4. Test Period

    4.1  Test Period. Tests shall be performed by establishing the 
conditions set forth in Section 2, and using control settings as set 
forth in Section 3, above.
    4.1.1  Nonautomatic Defrost. If the model being tested has no 
automatic defrost system, the test time period shall start after steady 
state conditions have been achieved and be of not less than three hours 
in duration. During the test period, the compressor motor shall complete 
two or more whole compressor cycles (a compressor cycle is a complete 
``on'' and a complete ``off'' period of the motor). If no ``off'' 
cycling will occur, as determined during the stabilization period, the 
test period shall be three hours. If incomplete cycling (less than two 
compressor cycles) occurs during a 24 hour period, the results of the 24 
hour period shall be used.
    4.1.2  Automatic Defrost. If the model being tested has an automatic 
defrost system, the test time period shall start after steady state 
conditions have been achieved and be from one point during a defrost 
period to the same point during the next defrost period. If the model 
being tested has a long-time automatic defrost system, the alternative 
provisions of 4.1.2.1 may be used.If the model being tested has a 
variable defrost control, the provisions of section 4.1.2.2 or 4.1.2.3 
shall apply. If the model has a dual compressor system the provisions of 
4.1.2.4 shall apply.
    4.1.2.1   Long-time Automatic Defrost. If the model being tested has 
a long-time automatic defrost system, the test time period may consist 
of two parts. A first part would be the same as the test for a unit 
having no defrost provisions (section 4.1.1). The second part would 
start when a defrost period is initiated during a compressor ``on'' 
cycle and terminate at the second turn ``on'' of the compressor motor or 
after four hours, whichever comes first.
    4.1.2.2  Variable defrost control. If the model being tested has a 
variable defrost control system, the test shall consist of three parts. 
Two parts shall be the same as the test for long-time automatic defrost 
(section 4.1.2.1). The third part is the optional test to determine the 
time between defrosts (section 5.2.1.3). The third part is used by 
manufacturers that choose not to accept the default value of F of 0.20, 
to calculate CT.
    4.1.2.3  Variable defrost control optional test. After steady-state 
conditions with no door openings are achieved in accordance with section 
3.3 above, the test is continued using the above daily door-opening 
sequence until stabilized operation is achieved. Stabilization is 
defined as a minimum of three consecutive defrost cycles with times 
between defrosts that will allow the calculation of a Mean Time Between 
Defrosts (MTBD1) that satisfies the statistical relationship of 90 
percent confidence. The test is repeated on at least one more unit of 
the model and until the Mean Time Between Defrosts for the multiple unit 
tests (MTBD2) satisfies the statistical relationship. If the time 
between defrosts is greater than 96 hours (compressor ``on'' time) and 
this defrost period can be repeated on a second unit, the test may be 
terminated at 96 hours (CT) and the absolute time value used for MTBD 
for each unit.
    4.1.2.4  Dual compressor systems with automatic defrost. If the 
model being tested has separate compressor systems for the refrigerator 
and freezer sections, each with its own automatic defrost system, then 
the two-part method in 4.1.2.1 shall be used. The second part of the 
method will be conducted separately for each automatic defrost system. 
The auxiliary components (fan motors, anti-sweat heaters, etc.) will be 
identified for each system and the energy consumption measured during 
each test.

                          5. Test Measurements

    5.1  Temperature Measurements. Temperature measurements shall be 
made at the locations prescribed in Figures 7.1 and 7.2 of HRF-1-1979 
and shall be accurate to within <plus-minus> 0.5  deg.F. (0.3  deg.C.) 
of true value. No freezer temperature measurements need be taken in an 
all-refrigerator model.
    If the interior arrangements of the cabinet do not conform with 
those shown in Figure 7.1 and 7.2 of HRF-1-1979, measurements shall be 
taken at selected locations chosen

[[Page 132]]

to represent approximately the entire refrigerated compartment. The 
locations selected shall be a matter of record.
    5.1.1  Measured Temperature. The measured temperature of a 
compartment is to be the average of all sensor temperature readings 
taken in that compartment at a particular time. Measurements shall be 
taken at regular intervals not to exceed four minutes.
    5.1.2  Compartment Temperature. The compartment temperature for each 
test period shall be an average of the measured temperatures taken in a 
compartment during a complete cycle or several complete cycles of the 
compressor motor (one compressor cycle is one complete motor ``on'' and 
one complete motor ``off'' period). For long-time automatic defrost 
models, compartment temperatures shall be those measured in the first 
part of the test period specified in 4.1.1. For models equipped with 
variable defrost controls, compartment temperatures shall be those 
measured in the first part of the test period specified in 4.1.2.2 
above.
    5.1.2.1  The number of complete compressor motor cycles over which 
the measured temperatures in a compartment are to be averaged to 
determine compartment temperature shall be equal to the number of 
minutes between measured temperature readings, rounded up to the next 
whole minute or a number of complete cycles over a time period exceeding 
one hour. One of the cycles shall be the last complete compressor motor 
cycle during the test period.
    5.1.2.2  If no compressor motor cycling occurs, the compartment 
temperature shall be the average of the measured temperatures taken 
during the last thirty-two minutes of the test period.
    5.1.2.3  If incomplete cycling occurs, the compartment temperatures 
shall be the average of the measured temperatures taken during the last 
three hours of the last complete ``on'' period.
    5.2  Energy Measurements
    5.2.1  Per-day Energy Consumption. The energy consumption in 
kilowatt-hours per day for each test period shall be the energy expended 
during the test period as specified in section 4.1 adjusted to a 24 hour 
period. The adjustment shall be determined as follows:
    5.2.1.1  Nonautomatic and automatic defrost models. The energy 
consumption in kilowatt-hours per day shall be calculated equivalent to:

ET=EPx1440/T

where

ET=test cycle energy expended in kilowatt-hours per day,
EP=energy expended in kilowatt-hours during the test period,
T=length of time of the test period in minutes, and
1440=conversion factor to adjust to a 24 hour period in minutes per day.

    5.2.1.2  Long-time Automatic Defrost. If the two part test method is 
used, the energy consumption in kilowatt-hours per day shall be 
calculated equivalent to:

ET=(1440xEP1/T1)+((EP2-(EP1xT2/T1))x12/CT)

where

ET and 1440 are defined in 5.2.1.1,
EP1=energy expended in kilowatt-hours during the first part of the test,
EP2=energy expended in kilowatt-hours during the second part of the 
test,
T1 and T2=length of time in minutes of the first and second test parts 
respectively,
CT=Defrost timer run time in hours required to cause it to go through a 
complete cycle, to the nearest tenth hour per cycle, and
12=factor to adjust for a 50% run time of the compressor in hours per 
day.

    5.2.1.3  Variable defrost control. The energy consumption in 
kilowatt-hours per day shall be calculated equivalent to:

ET=(1440xEP1/T1)+(EP2-(EP1xT2/T1))x(12/CT) where 1440 is defined in 
5.2.1.1 and EP1, EP2, T1, T2 and 12 are defined in 5.2.1.2.

CT=CT<INF>L</INF>xCT<INF>M</INF>)/(Fx(CT<INF>M</INF>-
CT<INF>L</INF>)+CT<INF>L</INF>)

(greater than CT<INF>L</INF> but not more than 96 hours)
F=ratio of per day energy consumption in excess of the least energy and 
the maximum difference in per day energy consumption and is equal to
F = (1/CT - 1/CT<INF>M</INF>)/(1/CT<INF>L</INF> - 1/CT<INF>M</INF> = 
(ET-ET<INF>L</INF>)/ET<INF>M</INF> - ET<INF>L</INF>) or 0.20 in lieu of 
testing to find CT.
ET<INF>L</INF> = least electrical energy used (kilowatt hours)

to conducting energy consumption tests, the operability of thermostatic 
controls that permit the mixing of exterior and ambient air when 
exterior air temperatures are less than 60  deg.F must be verified. The 
operability of such controls shall be verified by operating the unit 
under ambient air temperature of 90  deg.F and exterior air temperature 
of 45  deg.F. If the inlet air entering the condenser or condenser/
compressor compartment is maintained at 60  deg.F, plus or minus three 
degrees, energy consumption of the unit shall be measured under 5.4.2.2 
and 5.4.2.3. If the inlet air entering the condenser or condenser/
compressor compartment is not maintained at 60  deg.F, plus or minus 
three degrees, energy consumption of the unit shall also be measured 
under 5.4.2.4.

correction factor, K, two full cycle tests shall be conducted to measure 
energy consumption of the unit with air mixing controls disabled and the 
condenser inlet air temperatures set at 90  deg.F (32.2  deg.C) and 80 
deg.F (26.7  deg.C). Both tests shall be conducted with all compartment 
temperature controls set at the position midway between their warmest 
and coldest settings and the anti-sweat heater switch off. Record the 
energy consumptions ec<INF>90</INF> and ec<INF>80,</INF> in kWh/day.

at 90  deg.F (32.2  deg.C) exterior air temperature to record the energy 
consumptions (e<INF>90</INF>)<INF>i</INF> in kWh/day. For a given 
setting of the anti-sweat heater, i corresponds to each of the two 
states of the compartment temperature control positions.
    5.4.2.3  Energy consumption at 60  deg.F. The unit shall be tested 
at 60  deg.F (26.7  deg.C) exterior air temperature to record the energy 
consumptions (e<INF>60</INF>)<INF>i</INF> in kWh/day. For a given 
setting of the anti-sweat heater, i corresponds to each of the two 
states of the compartment temperature control positions.
    5.4.2.4  Energy consumption if mixing controls do not operate 
properly. If the operability of temperature and mixing controls has not 
been verified as required under 5.4.1, the unit shall be tested at 50 
deg.F (10.0  deg.C) and 30  deg.F (-1.1  deg.C) exterior air 
temperatures to record the energy consumptions 
(e<INF>50</INF>)<INF>i</INF> and (e<INF>30</INF>)<INF>i</INF>. For a 
given setting of the anti-sweat heater, i corresponds to each of the two 
states of the compartment temperature control positions.

cycle energy consumption measurements for the externally vented 
refrigerator or refrigerator-freezer shall be calculated in accordance 
with the requirements of this Appendix, as modified in sections 6.3.1-
6.3.7.

where ec<INF>90</INF> and ec<INF>80</INF> = the energy consumption test 
results as determined under 5.4.2.1.

    6.3.2  Combining test results of different settings of compartment 
temperature controls. For a given setting of the anti-sweat heater, 
follow the calculation procedures of 6.2 to combine the test results for 
energy consumption of the unit at different temperature control settings 
for each condenser inlet air temperature tested under 5.4.2.2, 5.4.2.3,

[egr]<INF>60</INF>, [egr]<INF>50</INF>, and [egr]<INF>30</INF> 
calculated in 6.3.2 shall be adjusted by multiplying the correction 
factor K to obtain the corrected energy consumptions per day, in kWh/
day:

E<INF>90</INF> = K x [egr]<INF>90</INF>,
E<INF>60</INF> = K x [egr]<INF>60</INF>
E<INF>50</INF> = K x [egr]<INF>50</INF>, and
E<INF>30</INF> = K x [egr]<INF>30</INF>

where,

K is determined under section 6.3.1, and [egr]<INF>90</INF>, 
[egr]<INF>60</INF>, [egr]<INF>50</INF>, and [egr]<INF>30</INF> are 
determined under section 6.3.2.


[[Page 135]]


    6.3.4  Energy profile equation. For a given setting of the anti-
sweat heater, the energy consumption E<INF>X</INF>, in kWh/day, at a 
specific exterior air temperature between 80  deg.F (26.7  deg.C) and 60 
 deg.F (26.7  deg.C) shall be calculated by the following equation:

temperatures, E<INF>80</INF>, E<INF>75</INF> and E<INF>65</INF>, 
respectively, in kWh/day, using the equation in 6.3.4.
    6.3.6  National average per cycle energy consumption. For a given 
setting of the anti-sweat heater, calculate the national average energy 
consumption, E<INF>N</INF>, in kWh/day, using one of the following

x E<INF>75</INF> + 0.131 x E<INF>80</INF>, for units not tested under 
5.4.2.4,

E<INF>N</INF> = 0.257 x E<INF>30</INF> + 0.266 x E<INF>50</INF> + 0.165 
x E<INF>65</INF> + 0.181 x E<INF>75</INF> + 0.131 x E<INF>80</INF>, for

average per cycle energy consumption is required to be calculated, for a 
given setting of the anti-sweat heater, calculate the regional average 
per cycle energy consumption, E<INF>R</INF>, in kWh/day, for the regions 
in figure 1 using one of the following equations and the coefficients in

Appendix B1 to Subpart B of Part 430--Uniform Test Method for Measuring 
                   the Energy Consumption of Freezers

                             1. Definitions.

    1.1  ``HRF-1-1979'' means the Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers standard for household refrigerators, combination 
refrigerators-freezers, and household freezers, also approved as an 
American National Standard as a revision of ANSI B38.1-1970.
    1.2  ``Anti-sweat heater'' means a device incorporated into the 
design of a freezer to prevent the accumulation of moisture on exterior 
surfaces of the cabinet under conditions of high ambient humidity.
    1.3  ``Cycle'' means the period of 24 hours for which the energy use 
of a freezer is calculated as though the consumer-activated compartment 
temperature controls were preset so that the desired compartment 
temperatures were maintained.
    1.4  ``Cycle type'' means the set of test conditions having the 
calculated effect of operating a freezer for a period of 24 hours with 
the consumer-activated controls other than the compartment temperature 
control set to establish various operating characteristics.
    1.5  ``Standard cycle'' means the cycle type in which the anti-sweat 
heater switch, when provided, is set in the highest energy consuming 
position.
    1.6  ``Adjusted total volume'' means the product of, (1) the freezer 
volume as defined in HRF-1-1979 in cubic feet, times (2) an adjustment 
factor.
    1.7  ``Automatic Defrost'' means a system in which the defrost cycle 
is automatically initiated and terminated, with resumption of normal 
refrigeration at the conclusion of defrost operation. The system 
automatically prevents the permanent formation of frost on all 
refrigerated surfaces. Nominal refrigerated food temperatures are 
maintained during the operation of the automatic defrost system.
    1.8  ``Long-time Automatic Defrost'' means an automatic defrost 
system where successive defrost cycles are separated by 14 hours or more 
of compressor-operating time.
    1.9  ``Stabilization Period'' means the total period of time during 
which steady-state conditions are being attained or evaluated.
    1.10  ``Variable defrost control'' means a long-time automatic 
defrost system (except the 14-hour defrost qualification does not

[[Page 137]]

apply) where successive defrost cycles are determined by an operating 
condition variable or variables other than solely compressor operating 
time. This includes any electrical or mechanical device. Demand defrost 
is a type of variable defrost control.
    1.11  ``Quick freeze'' means an optional feature on freezers which 
is initiated manually and shut off manually. It bypasses the thermostat 
control and places the compressor in a steady-state operating condition 
until it is shut off.

                           2. Test Conditions.

    2.1  Ambient temperature. The ambient temperature shall be 
90.0<plus-minus>1.0  deg.F. (32.2<plus-minus>0.6  deg.C.) during the 
stabilization period and during the test period. The ambient temperature 
shall be 80<plus-minus>2  deg.F dry bulb and 67  deg.F wet bulb during 
the stabilization period and during the test period when the unit is 
tested in accordance with section 3.3.
    2.2  Operational conditions. The freezer shall be installed and its 
operating conditions maintained in accordance with HRF-1-1979, section 
7.2 through section 7.4.3.3, except that the vertical ambient gradient 
at locations 10 inches (25.4 cm) out from the the centers of the two 
sides of the unit being tested is to be maintained during the test. 
Unless the area is obstructed by shields or baffles, the gradient is to 
be maintained from 2 inches (5.1 cm) above the floor or supporting 
platform to a height one foot (30.5 cm) above the unit under test. 
Defrost controls are to be operative and the anti-sweat heater switch is 
to be ``on'' during one test and ``off'' during a second test. The quick 
freeze option shall be switched off unless specified.
    2.3  Steady State Condition. Steady state conditions exist if the 
temperature measurements taken at four minute intervals or less during a 
stabilization period are not changing at a rate greater than 0.042 
deg.F. (0.023  deg.C.) per hour as determined by the applicable 
condition of A or B.
A--The average of the measurements during a two hour period if no 
cycling occurs or during a number of complete repetitive compressor 
cycles through a period of no less than two hours is compared to the 
average over an equivalent time period with three hours elapsed between 
the two measurement periods.
B--If A above cannot be used, the average of the measurements during a 
number of complete repetitive compressor cycles through a period of no 
less than two hours and including the last complete cycle prior to a 
defrost period, or if no cycling occurs, the average of the measurements 
during the last two hours prior to a defrost period; are compared to the 
same averaging period prior to the following defrost period.

                        3. Test Control Settings.

    3.1  Model with no user operable temperature control. A test shall 
be performed during which the compartment temperature and energy use 
shall be measured. A second test shall be performed with the temperature 
control electrically short circuited to cause the compressor to run 
continuously. If the model has the quick freeze option, it is to be used 
to bypass the temperature control.
    3.2  Model with user operable temperature control. Testing shall be 
performed in accordance with one of the following sections using the 
standardized temperature of 0.0  deg.F. (-17.8  deg.C.). Variable 
defrost control models shall achieve 0<plus-minus>2  deg.F during the 
steady-state conditions prior to the optional test with no door 
openings.
    3.2.1  A first test shall be performed with all temperature controls 
set at their median position midway between their warmest and coldest 
settings. Knob detents shall be mechanically defeated if necessary to 
attain a median setting. A second test shall be performed with all 
controls set at either their warmest or their coldest setting (not 
electrically or mechanically bypassed), whichever is appropriate, to 
attempt to achieve compartment temperatures measured during the two 
tests which bound (i.e., one is above and one is below) the standardized 
temperature. If the compartment temperatures measured during these two 
tests bound the standardized temperature, then these test results shall 
be used to determine energy consumption. If the compartment temperature 
measured with all controls set at their coldest setting is above the 
standardized temperature, a third test shall be performed with all 
controls set at their warmest setting and the result of this test shall 
be used with the result of the test performed with all controls set at 
their coldest setting to determine energy consumption. If the 
compartment temperature measured with all controls set at their warmest 
setting is below the standardized temperature; then the result of this 
test alone will be used to determine energy consumption.
    3.2.2  Alternatively, a first test may be performed with all 
temperature controls set at their warmest setting. If the compartment 
temperature is below the standardized temperature, then the result of 
this test alone will be used to determine energy consumption. If the 
above condition is not met, then the unit shall be tested in accordance 
with 3.2.1 above.
    3.2.3  Alternatively, a first test may be performed with all 
temperature controls set at their coldest setting. If the compartment 
temperature is above the standardized temperature, a second test shall 
be performed with all controls set at their warmest setting and the 
results of these two tests shall be used to determine energy 
consumption. If

[[Page 138]]

the above condition is not met, then the unit shall be tested in 
accordance with 3.2.1 above.
    3.3 Variable defrost control optional test. After a steady-state 
condition is achieved, the door-opening sequence is initiated with an 
18<plus-minus>2 second freezer door-opening occurring every eight hours 
to obtain three door-openings per 24-hour period. The first freezer 
door-opening shall occur at the initiation of the test period. The 
door(s) are to be opened 60 to 90 deg.with an average velocity for the 
leading edge of the door of approximately two feet per second. Prior to 
the initiation of the door-opening sequence, the freezer defrost control 
mechanism may be re-initiated in order to minimize the test duration.

                             4. Test Period.

    4.1  Test Period. Tests shall be performed by establishing the 
conditions set forth in Section 2 and using control settings as set 
forth in Section 3 above.
    4.1.1  Nonautomatic Defrost. If the model being tested has no 
automatic defrost system, the test time period shall start after steady 
state conditions have been achieved, and be of not less than three 
hours' duration. During the test period the compressor motor shall 
complete two or more whole cycles (a compressor cycle is a complete 
``on'' and a complete ``off'' period of the motor). If no ``off'' 
cycling will occur, as determined during the stabilization period, the 
test period shall be three hours. If incomplete cycling (less than two 
compressor cycles) occurs during a 24 hour period, the results of the 24 
hour period shall be used.
    4.1.2  Automatic Defrost. If the model being tested has an automatic 
defrost system, the test time period shall start after steady state 
conditions have been achieved and be from one point during a defrost 
period to the same point during the next defrost period. If the model 
being tested has a long-time automatic defrost system, the alternate 
provisions of 4.1.2.1 may be used. If the model being tested has a 
variable defrost control the provisions of 4.1.2.2. shall apply.
    4.1.2.1  Long-time Automatic Defrost. If the model being tested has 
a long-time automatic defrost system, the test time period may consist 
of two parts. A first part would be the same as the test for a unit 
having no defrost provisions (section 4.1.1). The second part would 
start when a defrost period is initiated during a compressor ``on'' 
cycle and terminate at the second turn ``on'' of the compressor motor or 
after four hours, whichever comes first.
    4.1.2.2 Variable defrost control. If the model being tested has a 
variable defrost control system, the test shall consist of three parts. 
Two parts shall be the same as the test for long-time automatic defrost 
in accordance with section 4.1.2.1 above. The third part is the optional 
test to determine the time between defrosts (5.2.1.3). The third part is 
used by manufacturers that choose not to accept the default value of F 
of 0.20, to calculate CT.
    4.1.2.3 Variable defrost control optional test. After steady-state 
conditions with no door-openings are achieved in accordance with section 
3.3 above, the test is continued using the above daily door-opening 
sequence until stabilized operation is achieved. Stabilization is 
defined as a minimum of three consecutive defrost cycles with times 
between defrost that will allow the calculation of a Mean Time Between 
Defrosts (MTBD1) that satisfies the statistical relationship of 90 
percent confidence. The test is repeated on at least one more unit of 
the model and until the Mean Time Between Defrosts for the multiple unit 
test (MTBD2) satisfies the statistical relationship. If the time between 
defrosts is greater than 96 hours (compressor ``on'' time) and this 
defrost period can be repeated on a second unit, the test may be 
terminated at 96 hours (CT) and the absolute time value used for MTBD 
for each unit.

motor (one compressor cycle is one complete motor ``on'' and one 
complete motor ``off'' period). For long-time automatic defrost models, 
compartment temperature shall be that measured in the first part of the 
test period specified in 4.1.1. For models equipped with variable 
defrost controls, compartment temperatures shall be those measured in 
the first part of the test period specified in 4.1.2.2.

the measured temperatures in a compartment are to be averaged to 
determine compartment temperature shall be equal to the number of 
minutes between measured temperature readings rounded up to the next 
whole minute or a number of complete cycles over a time period exceeding 
one hour. One of the cycles shall be the last complete compressor motor 
cycles during the test period.

                   3. test procedures and measurements

    3.1  Drum capacity. Measure the drum capacity by sealing all 
openings in the drum except the loading port with a plastic bag, and 
ensure that all corners and depressions are filled and that there are no 
extrusions of the plastic bag through the opening in the drum. Support 
the dryer's rear drum surface on a platform scale to prevent deflection 
of the dryer, and record the weight of the empty dryer. Fill the drum 
with water to a level determined by the intersection of the door plane 
and the loading port. Record the temperature of the water and then the 
weight of the dryer with the added water and then determine the mass of 
the water in pounds. Add or subtract the appropriate volume depending on 
whether or not the plastic bag protrudes into the drum interior. The 
drum capacity is calculated as follows:

C=w/d

setting and dry the test load until the moisture content of the test 
load is between 2.5 percent to 5.0 percent of the bone-dry weight of the 
test load, but do not permit the dryer to advance into cool down. If 
required, reset the timer or automatic dry control.

                             4. Installation

    4.1  Water Heater Mounting. A water heater designed to be 
freestanding shall be placed on a \3/4\ inch (2 cm) thick plywood 
platform supported by three 2 x 4 inch (5 cm x 10 cm) runners. If the 
water heater is not approved for installation on combustible flooring, 
suitable non-combustible material shall be placed between the water 
heater and the platform. Counter-top water heaters shall be placed 
against a simulated wall section. Wall-mounted water heaters shall be 
supported on a simulated wall in accordance with the manufacturer-
published installation instructions. When a simulated wall is used, the 
recommended construction is 2 x 4 inch (5 cm x 10 cm) studs, faced with 
\3/4\ inch (2 cm) plywood. For heat pump water heaters that are supplied 
with a storage tank, the two components, if not delivered as a single 
package, shall be connected in accordance with the manufacturer-
published installation instructions and the overall system shall be 
placed on the above-described plywood platform. If installation 
instructions are not provided by the heat pump manufacturer, uninsulated 
8 foot (2.4 m) long connecting hoses having an inside diameter of \5/8\ 
inch (1.6 cm) shall be used to connect the storage tank and the heat 
pump water heater. With the exception of using the storage tank 
described in 4.10, the same requirements shall apply for heat pump water 
heaters that are supplied without a storage tank from the manufacturer. 
The testing of the water heater shall occur in an area that is protected 
from drafts.
    4.2  Water Supply. Connect the water heater to a water supply 
capable of delivering water at conditions as specified in Sections 2.3 
and 2.5 of this appendix.
    4.3  Water Inlet and Outlet Configuration. For freestanding water 
heaters that are taller than 36 inches (91.4 cm), inlet and outlet 
piping connections shall be configured in a manner consistent with 
Figures 1 and 2. Inlet and outlet piping connections for wall-mounted 
water heaters shall be consistent with Figure 3. For freestanding water 
heaters that are 36 inches or less in height and not supplied as part of 
a counter-top enclosure (commonly referred to as an under-the-counter 
model), inlet and outlet piping shall be installed in a manner 
consistent with Figures 4, 5, and 6. For water heaters that are supplied 
with a counter-top enclosure, inlet and outlet piping shall be made in a 
manner consistent with Figures 7A and 7B, respectively. The vertical 
piping noted in Figures 7A and 7B shall be located (whether inside the 
enclosure or along the outside in a recessed channel) in accordance with 
the manufacturer-published installation instructions.
    All dimensions noted in Figures 1 through 7 shall be achieved. All 
piping between the water heater and the inlet and outlet temperature 
sensors, noted as T<INF>IN</INF> and T<INF>OUT</INF> in the figures, 
shall be Type ``L'' hard copper having the same diameter as the 
connections on the water heater. Unions may be used to facilitate 
installation and removal of the piping arrangements. A pressure gauge 
and diaphragm expansion tank shall be installed in the supply water 
piping at a location upstream of the inlet temperature sensor. An 
appropriately rated pressure and temperature relief valve shall be 
installed on all

[[Page 150]]

water heaters at the port specified by the manufacturer. Discharge 
piping for the relief valve shall be non-metallic. If heat traps, piping 
insulation, or pressure relief valve insulation are supplied with the 
water heater, they shall be installed for testing. Except when using a 
simulated wall, clearance shall be provided such that none of the piping 
contacts other surfaces in the test room.

    4.4  Fuel and/or Electrical Power and Energy Consumption. Install 
one or more instruments which measure, as appropriate, the quantity and 
rate of electrical energy and/or fossil fuel consumption in accordance 
with Section 3. For heat pump water heaters that use supplemental 
resistive heating, the electrical energy supplied to the resistive 
element(s) shall be metered separately from the electrical energy 
supplied to the entire appliance or to the remaining components (e.g., 
compressor, fans, pumps, controls).
    4.5  Internal Storage Tank Temperature Measurements. Install six 
temperature measurement sensors inside the water heater tank with a 
vertical distance of at least 4 inches (100 mm) between successive 
sensors. A temperature sensor shall be positioned at the vertical 
midpoint of each of the six equal

[[Page 155]]

volume nodes within the tank. Nodes designate the equal volumes used to 
evenly partition the total volume of the tank. As much as is possible, 
the temperature sensor should be positioned away from any heating 
elements, anodic protective devices, tank walls, and flue pipe walls. If 
the tank cannot accommodate six temperature sensors and meet the 
installation requirements specified above, install the maximum number of 
sensors which comply with the installation requirements. The temperature 
sensors shall be installed either through (1) the anodic device opening; 
(2) the relief valve opening; or (3) the hot water outlet. If installed 
through the relief valve opening or the hot water outlet, a tee fitting 
or outlet piping, as applicable, shall be installed as close as possible 
to its original location. If the relief valve temperature sensor is 
relocated, and it no longer extends into the top of the tank, a 
substitute relief valve that has a sensing element that can reach into 
the tank shall be installed. If the hot water outlet includes a heat 
trap, the heat trap shall be installed on top of the tee fitting. Added 
fittings shall be covered with thermal insulation having an R value 
between 4 and 8 h<SUP>0</SUP>ft<SUP>2/</SUP>  deg.F/Btu (0.7 and 1.4 
m<SUP>2/</SUP>  deg.C/W).
    4.6  Ambient Air Temperature Measurement. Install an ambient air 
temperature sensor at the vertical mid-point of the water heater and 
approximately 2 feet (610 mm) from the surface of the water heater. The 
sensor shall be shielded against radiation.
    4.7  Inlet and Outlet Water Temperature Measurements. Install 
temperature sensors in the cold-water inlet pipe and hot-water outlet 
pipe as shown in Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7a and 7b, as applicable.
    4.8  Flow Control. A valve shall be installed to provide flow as 
specified in sections 5.1.4.1 for storage tank water heaters and 5.2.1 
for instantaneous water heaters.
    4.9  Flue Requirements.
    4.9.1  Gas-Fired Water Heaters. Establish a natural draft in the 
following manner. For gas-fired water heaters with a vertically 
discharging draft hood outlet, a 5-foot (1.5-meter) vertical vent pipe 
extension with a diameter equal to the largest flue collar size of the 
draft hood shall be connected to the draft hood outlet. For gas-fired 
water heaters with a horizontally discharging draft hood outlet, a 90-
degree elbow with a diameter equal to the largest flue collar size of 
the draft hood shall be connected to the draft hood outlet. A 5-foot 
(1.5-meter) length of vent pipe shall be connected to the elbow and 
oriented to discharge vertically upward. Direct vent gas-fired water 
heaters shall be installed with venting equipment specified in the 
manufacturer's instructions using the minimum vertical and horizontal 
lengths of vent pipe recommended by the manufacturer.
    4.9.2  Oil-Fired Water Heaters. Establish a draft at the flue collar 
at the value specified in the manufacturer's instructions. Establish the 
draft by using a sufficient length of vent pipe connected to the water 
heater flue outlet, and directed vertically upward. For an oil-fired 
water heater with a horizontally discharging draft hood outlet, a 90-
degree elbow with a diameter equal to the largest flue collar size of 
the draft hood shall be connected to the draft hood outlet. A length of 
vent pipe sufficient to establish the draft shall be connected to the 
elbow fitting and oriented to discharge vertically upward. Direct-vent 
oil-fired water heaters should be installed with venting equipment as 
specified in the manufacturer's instructions, using the minimum vertical 
and horizontal lengths of vent pipe recommended by the manufacturer.
    4.10  Heat Pump Water Heater Storage Tank. The tank to be used for 
testing a heat pump water heater without a tank supplied by the 
manufacturer (see Section 1.12.3b) shall be an electric storage-type 
water heater having a measured volume of 47.0 gallons <plus-minus>1.0 
gallon (178 liters <plus-minus>3.8 liters); two 4.5 kW heating elements 
controlled in such a manner as to prevent both elements from operating 
simultaneously; and an energy factor greater than or equal to the 
minimum energy conservation standard (as determined in accordance with 
Section 6.1.7) and less than or equal to the sum of the minimum energy 
conservation standard and 0.02.

                           5. Test Procedures

    5.1  Storage-type Water Heaters, Including Heat Pump Water Heaters.
    5.1.1  Determination of Storage Tank Volume. Determine the storage 
capacity, V<INF>st,</INF> of the water heater under test, in gallons 
(liters), by subtracting the tare weight--measured while the tank is 
empty--from the gross weight of the storage tank when completely filled 
with water (with all air eliminated and line pressure applied as 
described in section 2.5) and dividing the resulting net weight by the 
density of water at the measured temperature.
    5.1.2  Setting the Thermostat.
    5.1.2.1  Single Thermostat Tanks. Starting with a tank at the supply 
water temperature, initiate normal operation of the water heater. After 
cut-out, determine the mean tank temperature every minute until the 
maximum value is observed. Determine whether this maximum value for the 
mean tank temperature is within the range of 135  deg.F<plus-minus>5 
deg.F (57.2  deg.C<plus-minus>2.8  deg.C). If not, turn off the water 
heater, adjust the thermostat, drain and refill the tank with supply 
water. Then, once again, initiate normal operation of the water heater, 
and determine the maximum mean tank temperature after cut-out. Repeat 
this sequence until the maximum mean

[[Page 156]]

tank temperature after cut-out is 135  deg.F<plus-minus>5  deg.F (57.2 
deg.C<plus-minus>2.8  deg.C).
    5.1.2.2  Tanks with Two or More Thermostats. Follow the same 
sequence as for a single thermostat tank, i.e. start at the supply water 
temperature, operate normally until cutout. Determine if the thermostat 
that controls the uppermost heating element yields a maximum water 
temperature of 135  deg.F<plus-minus>5  deg.F (57.2 
deg.C<plus-minus>2.8  deg.C), as measured by the in-tank sensors that 
are positioned above the uppermost heating element. If the tank 
temperature at the thermostat is not within 135  deg.F<plus-minus>5 
deg.F (57.2  deg.C<plus-minus>2.8  deg.C), turn off the water heater, 
adjust the thermostat, drain and refill the tank with supply water. The 
thermostat that controls the heating element positioned next highest in 
the tank shall then be set to yield a maximum water temperature of 135 
deg.F<plus-minus>5  deg.F (57.2  deg.C<plus-minus>2.8  deg.C). This 
process shall be repeated until the thermostat controlling the lowest 
element is correctly adjusted. When adjusting the thermostat that 
controls the lowest element, the maximum mean tank temperature after 
cut-out, as determined using all the in-tank sensors, shall be 135 
deg.F<plus-minus>5  deg.F (57.2  deg.C<plus-minus>2.8  deg.C). When 
adjusting all other thermostats, use only the in-tank temperature 
sensors positioned above the heating element in question to evaluate the 
maximum water temperature after cut-out.
    For heat pump water heaters that control an auxiliary resistive 
element, the thermostat shall be set in accordance with the 
manufacturer's installation instructions.
    5.1.3  Power Input Determination. For all water heaters except 
electric types having immersed heating elements, initiate normal 
operation and determine the power input, P, to the main burners 
(including pilot light power, if any) after 15 minutes of operation. If 
the water heater is equipped with a gas appliance pressure regulator, 
the regulator outlet pressure shall be set within <plus-minus> 10% of 
that recommended by the manufacturer. For oil-fired water heaters the 
fuel pump pressure shall be within <plus-minus> 10% of the 
manufacturer's specified pump pressure. All burners shall be adjusted to 
achieve an hourly Btu (kJ) rating that is within <plus-minus> 2% of the 
value specified by the manufacturer. For an oil-fired water heater, 
adjust the burner to give a CO<INF>2</INF> reading recommended by the 
manufacturer and an hourly Btu (kJ) rating that is within <plus-minus> 
2% of that specified by the manufacturer. Smoke in the flue may not 
exceed No. 1 smoke as measured by the procedure in ASTM-D-2156-80.
    5.1.4  First-Hour Rating Test.
    5.1.4.1  General. During hot water draws, remove water at a rate of 
3.0<plus-minus>0.25 gallons per minute (11.4<plus-minus>0.95 liters per 
minute). Collect the water in a container that is large enough to hold 
the volume removed during an individual draw and suitable for weighing 
at the termination of each draw. Alternatively, a water meter may be 
used to directly measure the water volume(s) withdrawn.
    5.1.4.2  Draw Initiation Criteria. Begin the first-hour rating test 
by imposing a draw on the storage-type water heater. After completion of 
this first draw, initiate successive draws based on the following 
criteria. For gas-and oil-fired water heaters, initiate successive draws 
when the thermostat acts to reduce the supply of fuel to the main 
burner. For electric water heaters having a single element or multiple 
elements that all operate simultaneously, initiate successive draws when 
the thermostat acts to reduce the electrical input supplied to the 
element(s). For electric water heaters having two or more elements that 
do not operate simultaneously, initiate successive draws when the 
applicable thermostat acts to reduce the electrical input to the element 
located vertically highest in the storage tank. For heat pump waters 
heaters that do not use supplemental resistive heating, initiate 
successive draws immediately after the electrical input to the 
compressor is reduced by the action of the water heater's thermostat. 
For heat pump waters heaters that use supplemental resistive heating, 
initiate successive draws immediately after the electrical input to the 
compressor or the uppermost resistive element is reduced by the action 
of the applicable water heater thermostat. This draw initiation 
criterion for heat pump water heaters that use supplemental resistive 
heating, however, shall only apply when the water located above the 
thermostat at cut-out is heated to 135  deg.F<plus-minus>5  deg.F (57.2 
deg.C<plus-minus>2.8  deg.C).
    5.1.4.3  Test Sequence. Establish normal water heater operation. If 
the water heater is not presently operating, initiate a draw. The draw 
may be terminated anytime after cut-in occurs. After cut-out occurs 
(i.e., all thermostats are satisfied), monitor the internal storage tank 
temperature sensors described in section 4.5 every minute.
    Initiate a draw after a maximum mean tank temperature has been 
observed following cut-out. Record the time when the draw is initiated 
and designate it as an elapsed time of zero ([tgr]* = 0). (The 
superscript * is used to denote variables pertaining to the first-hour 
rating test.) Record the outlet water temperature beginning 15 seconds 
after the draw is initiated and at 5-second intervals thereafter until 
the draw is terminated. Determine the maximum outlet temperature that 
occurs during this first draw and record it as T*<INF>max, 1</INF>. For 
the duration of this first draw and all successive draws, in addition, 
monitor the inlet temperature to the water heater to ensure that the 
required 58  deg.F<plus-minus>2  deg.F (14.4  deg.C<plus-minus>1.1 
deg.C) test condition is met. Terminate the hot water draw when the 
outlet temperature decreases to T*<INF>max,1</INF>-25  deg.F 
(T*<INF>max,1</INF>-13.9  deg.C). Record this temperature as

[[Page 157]]

T*<INF>min,1</INF>. Following draw termination, determine the average 
outlet water temperature and the mass or volume removed during this 
first draw and record them as T*<INF>del,1</INF> and M*<INF>1</INF> or 
V*<INF>1,</INF> respectively.
    Initiate a second and, if applicable, successive draw each time the 
applicable draw initiation criteria described in section 5.1.4.2 are 
satisfied. As required for the first draw, record the outlet water 
temperature 15 seconds after initiating each draw and at 5-second 
intervals thereafter until the draw is terminated. Determine the maximum 
outlet temperature that occurs during each draw and record it as 
T*<INF>max, i</INF>, where the subscript i refers to the draw number. 
Terminate each hot water draw when the outlet temperature decreases to 
T*<INF>max, i</INF>-25  deg.F (T*<INF>max, i</INF>-13.9  deg.C). Record 
this temperature as T*<INF>min, i</INF>. Calculate and record the 
average outlet temperature and the mass or volume removed during each 
draw (T*<INF>del, i</INF> and M*<INF>i</INF> or V*<INF>i,</INF> 
respectively). Continue this sequence of draw and recovery until one 
hour has elapsed, then shut off the electrical power and/or fuel 
supplied to the water heater.
    If a draw is occurring at an elapsed time of one hour, continue this 
draw until the outlet temperature decreases to T*<INF>max, n</INF>-25 
deg.F (T*<INF>max, n</INF> -13.9  deg.C), at which time the draw shall 
be immediately terminated. (The subscript n shall be used to denote 
quantities associated with the final draw.) If a draw is not occurring 
at an elapsed time of one hour, a final draw shall be imposed at one 
hour. This draw shall be immediately terminated when the outlet 
temperature first indicates a value less than or equal to the cut-off 
temperature used for the previous draw (T*<INF>min, n</INF>-1). For 
cases where the outlet temperature is close to T*<INF>min, n</INF>-1, 
the final draw shall proceed for a minimum of 30 seconds. If an outlet 
temperature greater than T*<INF>min, n</INF>-1 is not measured within 30 
seconds, the draw shall be immediately terminated and zero additional 
credit shall be given towards first-hour rating (i.e., M*<INF>n</INF> = 
0 or V*<INF>n</INF> = 0). After the final draw is terminated, calculate 
and record the average outlet temperature and the mass or volume removed 
during the draw (T*<INF>del, n</INF> and M*<INF>n</INF> or 
V*<INF>n,</INF> respectively).
    5.1.5  24-Hour Simulated Use Test. During the simulated use test, a 
total of 64.<plus-minus>3 1.0 gallons (243<plus-minus>3.8 liters) shall 
be removed. This value is referred to as the daily hot water usage in 
the following text.
    With the water heater turned off, fill the water heater with supply 
water and apply pressure as described in section 2.5. Turn on the water 
heater and associated heat pump unit, if present. After the cut-out 
occurs, the water heater may be operated for up to three cycles of 
drawing until cut-in, and then operating until cut-out, prior to the 
start of the test.
    At this time, record the mean tank temperature (T<INF>o</INF>), and 
the electrical and/or fuel measurement readings, as appropriate. Begin 
the 24-hour simulated use test by withdrawing a volume from the water 
heater that equals one-sixth of the daily hot water usage. Record the 
time when this first draw is initiated and assign it as the test elapsed 
time ([tgr]) of zero (0). Record the average storage tank and ambient 
temperature every 15 minutes throughout the 24-hour simulated use test 
unless a recovery or a draw is occurring. At elapsed time intervals of 
one, two, three, four, and five hours from [tgr] = 0, initiate 
additional draws, removing an amount of water equivalent to one-sixth of 
the daily hot water usage with the maximum allowable deviation for any 
single draw being <plus-minus> 0.5 gallons (1.9 liters). The quantity of 
water withdrawn during the sixth draw shall be increased or decreased as 
necessary such that the total volume of water withdrawn equals 64.3 
gallons <plus-minus> 1.0 gallon (243.4 liters <plus-minus> 3.8 liters).
    All draws during the simulated use test shall be made at flow rates 
of 3.0 gallons <plus-minus> 0.25 gallons per minute (11.4 liters 
<plus-minus> 0.95 liters per minute). Measurements of the inlet and 
outlet temperatures shall be made 15 seconds after the draw is initiated 
and at every subsequent 5-second interval throughout the duration of 
each draw. The arithmetic mean of the hot water discharge temperature 
and the cold water inlet temperature shall be determined for each draw 
(T<INF>del, i</INF> and T<INF>in, i</INF>). Determine and record the net 
mass or volume removed (M<INF>i</INF> or V<INF>i</INF> ), as 
appropriate, after each draw.
    At the end of the recovery period following the first draw, record 
the maximum mean tank temperature observed after cut-out, 
T<INF>max, 1</INF>, and the energy consumed by an electric resistance, 
gas or oil-fired water heater, Q<INF>r</INF>. For heat pump water 
heaters, the total electrical energy consumed during the first recovery 
by the heat pump (including compressor, fan, controls, pump, etc.) and, 
if applicable, by the resistive element(s) shall be recorded as 
Q<INF>r</INF>.
    At the end of the recovery period that follows the sixth draw, 
determine and record the total electrical energy and/or fossil fuel 
consumed since the beginning of the test, Q<INF>su</INF>. In preparation 
for determining the energy consumed during standby, record the reading 
given on the electrical energy (watt-hour) meter, the gas meter, and/or 
the scale used to determine oil consumption, as appropriate. Record the 
maximum value of the mean tank temperature after cut-out as 
T<INF>su</INF>. Except as noted below, allow the water heater to remain 
in the standby mode until 24 hours have elapsed from the start of the 
test (i.e., since = 0). Prevent the water heater from beginning a 
recovery cycle during the last hour of the test by turning off the 
electric power to the electrical heating elements and heat pump, if 
present, or by turning down the fuel supply to the main burner at

[[Page 158]]

an elapsed time of 23 hours. If a recovery is taking place at an elapsed 
time of 23 hours, wait until the recovery is complete before reducing 
the electrical and/or fuel supply to the water heater. At 24 hours, 
record the mean tank temperature, T<INF>24</INF>, and the electric and/
or fuel instrument readings. Determine the total fossil fuel or 
electrical energy consumption, as appropriate, for the entire 24-hour 
simulated use test, Q. Record the time interval between the time at 
which the maximum mean tank temperature is observed after the sixth draw 
and the end of the 24-hour test as <INF>stby, 1</INF>. Record the time 
during which water is not being withdrawn from the water heater during 
the entire 24-hour period as <INF>stby, 2</INF>.
    5.2  Instantaneous Gas and Electric Water Heaters
    5.2.1  Setting the Outlet Discharge Temperature. Initiate normal 
operation of the water heater at the full input rating for electric 
instantaneous water heaters and at the maximum firing rate specified by 
the manufacturer for gas instantaneous water heaters. Monitor the 
discharge water temperature and set to a value of 135  deg.F 
<plus-minus> 5  deg.F (57.2  deg.C <plus-minus> 2.8  deg.C) in 
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. If the water heater is 
not capable of providing this discharge temperature when the flow rate 
is 3.0 gallons <plus-minus> 0.25 gallons per minute (11.4 liters 
<plus-minus> 0.95 liters per minute), then adjust the flow rate as 
necessary to achieve the specified discharge water temperature. Record 
the corresponding flow rate as V<INF>max</INF>.
    5.2.2  Additional Requirements for Variable Input Instantaneous Gas 
Water Heaters. If the instantaneous water heater incorporates a 
controller that permits operation at a reduced input rate, adjust the 
flow rate as necessary to achieve a discharge water temperature of 135 
deg.F <plus-minus> 5  deg.F (57.2  deg.C <plus-minus> 2.8  deg.C) while 
maintaining the minimum input rate. Record the corresponding flow rate 
as V<INF>min</INF>. If an outlet temperature of 135  deg.F <plus-minus> 
5  deg.F (57.2  deg.C <plus-minus> 2.8  deg.C) cannot be achieved at the 
minimum flow rate permitted by the instantaneous water heater, record 
the flow rate as V<INF>min</INF> and the corresponding outlet 
temperature as T<INF>min</INF>.
    5.2.3  Maximum GPM Rating Test for Instantaneous Water Heaters. 
Establish normal water heater operation at the full input rate for 
electric instantaneous water heaters and at the maximum firing rate for 
gas instantaneous water heaters with the discharge water temperature set 
in accordance with Section 5.2.1. During the 10-minute test, either 
collect the withdrawn water for later measurement of the total mass 
removed, or alternatively, use a water meter to directly measure the 
water volume removed.
    After recording the scale or water meter reading, initiate water 
flow throughout the water heater, record the inlet and outlet water 
temperatures beginning 15 seconds after the start of the test and at 
subsequent 5-second intervals throughout the duration of the test. At 
the end of 10 minutes, turn off the water. Determine the mass of water 
collected, M<INF>10m</INF>, in pounds (kilograms), or the volume of 
water, V<INF>10m</INF>, in gallons (liters).
    5.2.4 24-hour Simulated Use Test for Gas Instantaneous Water 
Heaters.
    5.2.4.1  Fixed Input Instantaneous Water Heaters. Establish normal 
operation with the discharge water temperature and flow rate set to 
values of 135  deg.F <plus-minus> 5  deg.F (57.2  deg.C <plus-minus> 2.8 
 deg.C) and V<INF>max</INF> per Section 5.2.1, respectively. With no 
draw occurring, record the reading given by the gas meter and/or the 
electrical energy meter as appropriate. Begin the 24-hour simulated use 
test by drawing an amount of water out of the water heater equivalent to 
one-sixth of the daily hot water usage. Record the time when this first 
draw is initiated and designate it as an elapsed time, [tgr], of 0. At 
elapsed time intervals of one, two, three, four, and five hours from 
[tgr] = 0, initiate additional draws, removing an amount of water 
equivalent to one-sixth of the daily hot water usage, with the maximum 
allowable deviation for any single draw being <plus-minus> 0.5 gallons 
(1.9 liters). The quantity of water drawn during the sixth draw shall be 
increased or decreased as necessary such that the total volume of water 
withdrawn equals 64.3 gallons <plus-minus> 1.0 gallons (243.4 liters 
<plus-minus> 3.8 liters).
    Measurements of the inlet and outlet water temperatures shall be 
made 15 seconds after the draw is initiated and at every 5-second 
interval thereafter throughout the duration of the draw. The arithmetic 
mean of the hot water discharge temperature and the cold water inlet 
temperature shall be determined for each draw. Record the scale used to 
measure the mass of the withdrawn water or the water meter reading, as 
appropriate, after each draw. At the end of the recovery period 
following the first draw, determine and record the fossil fuel or 
electrical energy consumed, Q<INF>r</INF>. Following the sixth draw and 
subsequent recovery, allow the water heater to remain in the standby 
mode until exactly 24 hours have elapsed since the start of the test 
(i.e., since [tgr] = 0). At 24 hours, record the reading given by the 
gas meter and/or the electrical energy meter as appropriate. Determine 
the fossil fuel or electrical energy consumed during the entire 24-hour 
simulated use test and designate the quantity as Q.
    5.2.4.2  Variable Input Instantaneous Water Heaters. If the 
instantaneous water heater incorporates a controller that permits 
continuous operation at a reduced input rate, the first three draws 
shall be conducted using the maximum flow rate, V<INF>max</INF>, while 
removing an amount of water equivalent to one-sixth of the daily hot 
water usage, with the maximum allowable deviation for any one of

[[Page 159]]

the three draws being <plus-minus> 0.5 gallons (1.9 liters). The second 
three draws shall be conducted at V<INF>min</INF>. If an outlet 
temperature of 135  deg.F <plus-minus> 5  deg.F (57.2  deg.C 
<plus-minus> 2.8  deg.C) could not be achieved at the minimum flow rate 
permitted by the instantaneous water heater, the last three draws should 
be lengthened such that the volume removed is:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11MY98.001

or
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11MY98.002

where T<INF>min</INF> is the outlet water temperature at the flow rate 
V<INF>min</INF> as determined in Section 5.2.1, and where the maximum 
allowable variation for any one of the three draws is <plus-minus> 0.5 
gallons (1.9 liters). The quantity of water withdrawn during the sixth 
draw shall be increased or decreased as necessary such that the total 
volume of water withdrawn equals (32.15 + 
3<INF>/</INF>V<INF>4,5,6</INF>) <plus-minus> 1.0 gallons

((121.7 + 3 / V<SUP>.</SUP> <INF>4,5,6</INF>) <plus-minus> 3.8 liters).

    Measurements of the inlet and outlet water temperatures shall be 
made 5 seconds after a draw is initiated and at every 5-second interval 
thereafter throughout the duration of the draw. Determine the arithmetic 
mean of the hot water discharge temperature and the cold water inlet 
temperature for each draw. Record the scale used to measure the mass of 
the withdrawn water or the water meter reading, as appropriate, after 
each draw. At the end of the recovery period following the first draw, 
determine and record the fossil fuel or electrical energy consumed, 
Q<INF>r, max</INF>. Likewise, record the reading of the meter used to 
measure fossil fuel or electrical energy consumption prior to the fourth 
draw and at the end of the recovery period following the fourth draw, 
and designate the difference as Q<INF>r,min</INF>. Following the sixth 
draw and subsequent recovery, allow the water heater to remain in the 
standby mode until exactly 24 hours have elapsed since the start of the 
test (i.e., since [tgr]=0). At 24 hours, record the reading given by the 
gas meter and/or the electrical energy meter, as appropriate. Determine 
the fossil fuel or electrical energy consumed during the entire 24-hour 
simulated use test and designate the quantity as Q.

simulated use test, recorded one minute before the first draw is 
initiated,  deg.F ( deg.C).
[eta]<INF>r</INF> = as defined in section 6.1.3.

    6.1.6  Adjusted Daily Water Heating Energy Consumption. The adjusted 
daily water heating energy consumption, Q<INF>da</INF>, takes into 
account that the temperature difference between the storage tank and 
surrounding ambient air may not be the nominal value of 67.5  deg.F (135 
 deg.F-67.5  deg.F) or 37.5  deg.C (57.2  deg.C-19.7  deg.C) due to the 
10  deg.F (5.6  deg.C) allowable variation in storage tank temperature, 
135  deg.F <plus-minus> 5  deg.F (57.2  deg.C <plus-minus> 2.8  deg.C), 
and the 5  deg.F (2.8  deg.C) allowable variation in surrounding ambient 
temperature 65  deg.F (18.3  deg.C) to 70  deg.F (21.1  deg.C). The 
adjusted daily water heating energy consumption is computed as:

Q<INF>da</INF> = Q<INF>D</INF> - [(T<INF>stby,</INF> 2</INF> - T<INF>a,</INF> 
stby,2</INF>) - (135  deg.F - 67.5  deg.F)] UA[tgr]<INF>stby,</INF> 2
</INF>or Q<INF>da</INF> = Q<INF>D</INF> - [(T<INF>stby,</INF> 2</INF> - 
T<INF>a,</INF> stby,</INF> 2</INF>) - (57.2  deg.C - 19.7  deg.C)]

test,  deg.F ( deg.C).
UA = as defined in section 6.1.4.
[tgr]<INF>stby, 2</INF> = the number of hours during the 24-hour 
simulated test when water is not being withdrawn from the water heater.

    A modification is also needed to take into account that the 
temperature difference between the outlet water temperature and supply 
water temperature may not be equivalent to the nominal value of 77 
deg.F (135  deg.F-58  deg.F) or 42.8  deg.C (57.2  deg.C-14.4  deg.C). 
The following equations adjust the experimental data to a nominal 77 
deg.F (42.8  deg.C) temperature rise.
    The energy used to heat water, Btu/day (kJ/day), may be computed as:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11MY98.011
    
Where:

M<INF>i</INF> = the mass withdrawn for the ith draw (i = 1 to 6), lb 
(kg).

 deg.F (kJ/kg/  deg.C).
T<INF>del, i</INF> = the average water outlet temperature measured 
during the ith draw (i=1 to 6),  deg.F ( deg.C).
T<INF>in, i</INF> = the average water inlet temperature measured during 
the ith draw (i=1 to 6),  deg.F ( deg.C).
[eta]<INF>r</INF> = as defined in section 6.1.3.
    The energy required to heat the same quantity of water over a 77 
deg.F (42.8  deg.C) temperature rise, Btu/day (kJ/day), is:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11MY98.012

    The difference between these two values is:

Q<INF>HWD</INF> = Q<INF>HW, 77 deg.-F</INF> -Q<INF>HW</INF>
or Q<INF>HWD</INF> = Q<INF>HW,42.8 deg.-F</INF> -Q<INF>HW</INF>
which must be added to the adjusted daily water heating energy 
consumption value. Thus, the daily energy consumption value which takes 
into account that the temperature difference between the storage tank 
and ambient temperature may not be 67.5  deg.F (37.5  deg.C) and that 
the temperature rise across the storage tank may not be 77  deg.F (42.8 
deg.C) is:

Q<INF>dm</INF> = Q<INF>da</INF> + Q<INF>HWD</INF>

    6.1.7  Energy Factor. The energy factor, Ef, is computed as:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11MY98.013
    
or
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11MY98.014

Where:

Q<INF>dm</INF> = the modified daily water heating energy consumption as 
computed in accordance with section 6.1.6, Btu (kJ).

(kg).
C<INF>pi</INF> = the specific heat of the water of the ith draw, Btu/lb 
deg.F (kJ/kg  deg.C).

    6.1.8  Annual Energy Consumption. The annual energy consumption for 
storage-type and heat pump water heaters is computed as:

E<INF>annual</INF> = 365 x Q<INF>dm</INF>

Where:

Q<INF>dm</INF> = the modified daily water heating energy consumption as 
computed in accordance with section 6.1.6, Btu (kJ).
365 = the number of days in a year.

Where:

hour simulated use test, gal (L).
[rho]= density of the water at the water temperature measured at the 
point where the flow volume is measured, lb/gal (kg/L).
C<INF>p1</INF> = specific heat of the withdrawn water, 
(T<INF>del,1</INF> + T<INF>in,1</INF>) / 2, Btu/lb  deg.F (kJ/kg

Q<INF>r</INF> = the total energy used by the water heater between cut-
out prior to the first draw and cut-out following the first draw,

using the following conversion: 1 kWh = 3,412 Btu.)
    6.2.2.2  Variable Input Instantaneous Water Heaters. For 
instantaneous water heaters that have a variable firing rate, two 
recovery efficiency values are computed, one at the maximum input rate 
and one at the minimum input rate. The recovery efficiency used in

Where:

M<INF>1</INF> = as defined in section 6.2.2.1.
C<INF>p1</INF> = as defined in section 6.2.2.1.
T<INF>del, 1</INF> = as defined in section 6.2.2.1.

Where:

M<INF>4</INF> = the mass withdrawn during the fourth draw, lb (kg), or, 
if the volume of water is being measured,
M<INF>4</INF> = V<INF>4</INF> [rho]

Where:

V<INF>4</INF> = total volume removed during the first draw of the 24-
hour simulated use test, gal (L).
[rho] = as defined in 6.2.2.1

[[Page 163]]

C<INF>p4</INF> = the specific heat of water, Btu/lb  deg.F (kJ/kg 
deg.C).
T<INF>del, 4</INF> = the average delivery temperature for the fourth 
draw,  deg.F ( deg.C).
T<INF>in, 4</INF> = the average inlet temperature for the fourth draw, 
deg.F ( deg.C).
Q<INF>r, min</INF> = the total energy consumed between the beginning of

Where:

[eta]<INF>r,max</INF> = as calculated above.
[eta]<INF>r,min</INF> = as calculated above.

    6.2.3  Daily Water Heating Energy Consumption. The daily water 
heating energy consumption, Q<INF>d</INF>, is computed as:

Q<INF>d</INF> = Q

Where:

Q = the energy used by the instantaneous water heater during the 24-hr 
simulated use test.

    A modification is needed to take into account that the temperature 
difference between the outlet water temperature and supply water 
temperature may not be equivalent to the nominal value of 77  deg.F (135 
 deg.F-58  deg.F) or 42.8  deg.C (57.2  deg.C-14.4  deg.C). The 
following equations adjust the experimental data to a nominal 77  deg.F 
(42.8  deg.C) temperature rise.
    The energy used to heat water may be computed as:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11MY98.022
    
Where:

M<INF>i</INF> = the mass withdrawn during the ith draw, lb (kg).
C<INF>pi</INF> = the specific heat of water of the ith draw, Btu/lb 
deg.F (kJ/kg ( deg.C).
T<INF>del,i</INF> = the average delivery temperature of the ith draw, 
deg.F ( deg.C).
T<INF>in,i</INF> = the average inlet temperature of the ith draw,  deg.F 
( deg.C).
[eta]<INF>r</INF> = as calculated in section 6.2.2.2.

    The energy required to heat the same quantity of water over a 77 
deg.F (42.8  deg.C) temperature rise is:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11MY98.023

Where:

M<INF>i</INF> = the mass withdrawn during the ith draw, lb (kg).
C<INF>pi</INF> = the specific heat of water of the ith draw, Btu/lb 
deg.F (kJ/kg ( deg.C).
[eta]<INF>r</INF> = as calculated above.

    The difference between these two values is:

Q<INF>HWD</INF> = Q<INF>HW,</INF> 77</INF> \<INF>F</INF> - Q<INF>HW
</INF>or Q<INF>HWD</INF> = Q<INF>HW,</INF> 42.8</INF> \<INF>C</INF> - 
Q<INF>HW

</INF>which much be added to the daily water heating energy consumption 
value. Thus, the daily energy consumption value which takes into account 
that the temperature rise across the storage tank may not be 77  deg.F 
(42.8  deg.C) is:

Q<INF>dm</INF> = Q<INF>d</INF> + Q<INF>HWD

    </INF>6.2.4  Energy Factor. The energy factor, E<INF>f</INF>, is 
computed as:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11MY98.024

Where:

Q<INF>dm</INF> = the daily water heating energy consumption as computed 
in accordance with section 6.2.3, Btu (kJ).
M<INF>i</INF> = the mass associated with the ith draw, lb (kg).
C<INF>pi</INF> = the specific heat of water computed at a temperature of 
(58  deg.F + 135  deg.F) / 2, Btu/lb  deg.F [(14.4  deg.C + 57.2  deg.C) 
/ 2, kJ/kg  deg.C].

    6.2.5  Annual Energy Consumption. The annual energy consumption for 
instantaneous type water heaters is computed as:

E<INF>annual</INF> = 365 x Q<INF>dm

</INF>Where:

Q<INF>dm</INF> = the modified daily energy consumption, Btu/day (kJ/
day).
365 = the number of days in a year.

                     7. Ratings for Untested Models

    In order to relieve the test burden on manufacturers who offer water 
heaters which differ only in fuel type or power input, ratings for 
untested models may be established in accordance with the following 
procedures. In lieu of the following procedures a manufacturer may elect 
to test the unit for which a rating is sought.
    7.1  Gas Water Heaters. Ratings obtained for gas water heaters using 
natural gas can be used for an identical water heater which utilizes 
propane gas if the input ratings are within <plus-minus> 10%.
    7.2  Electric Water Heaters
    7.2.1  First-Hour Rating. If an electric storage-type water heater 
is available with more

[[Page 164]]

than one input rating, the manufacturer shall designate the standard 
input rating, and the water heater need only be tested with heating 
elements at the designated standard input ratings. The first-hour 
ratings for units having power input rating less than the designated 
standard input rating shall be assigned a first-hour rating equivalent 
to the first draw of the first-hour rating for the electric water heater 
with the standard input rating. For units having power inputs greater 
than the designated standard input rating, the first-hour rating shall 
be equivalent to that measured for the water heater with the standard 
input rating.
    7.2.2  Energy Factor. The energy factor for identical electric 
storage-type water heaters, with the exception of heating element 
wattage, may use the energy factor obtained during testing of the water 
heater with the designated standard input rating.

switch, a vacation switch or both, turn the power switch, any

[[Page 168]]

vacation switch, and any remote er consumptions, (P<INF>max</INF>).The 
standby power is then calculated from the equation:

P<INF>s</INF>=[(P<INF>max</INF>-P<INF>min</INF>)/2]+P<INF>min</INF>

where

P<INF>s</INF>=standby power consumption in watts
P<INF>max</INF>=power consumption, in watts, measured with the

thermostat setting to provide an average internal temperature which is 
325 deg.<plus-minus>5  deg.F (180.6<plus-minus>2.8  deg.C) higher than 
the room ambient air temperature. This shall be done by measuring the 
maximum and minimum temperatures in any three consecutive cut-off/cut-on 
actions of the gas burners, excluding the initial cut-off/cut-on action, 
by the thermostat after the temperature rise of 325 deg.<plus-minus>5 
deg.F (180.6  deg.<plus-minus>2.8  deg.C) has been attained by the

conditions set forth

[[Page 172]]

in Section 2, ``TEST CONDITIONS,'' of this Appendix, and adjust any 
pilot lights of a conventional gas oven in accordance with the 
manufacturer's instructions and turn off the gas flow to the 
conventional cooking top, if so equipped. Before beginning the test, the 
conventional oven shall be at its normal nonoperating temperature as 
defined in Section 1.6 and described in Section 2.6. Set the 
conventional oven test block W<INF>1</INF> approximately in the center 
of the usable baking space. If there is a selector switch for selecting 
the mode of operation of the oven, set it for normal baking. If an oven 
permits baking by either forced convection by using a fan, or without 
forced convection, the oven is to be tested in each of those two modes. 
The oven shall remain on for at least one complete thermostat ``cut-off/
cut-on'' of the electrical resistance heaters or gas burners after the 
test block temperature has increased 234  deg.F (130  deg.C) above its 
initial temperature.
    3.1.1.1  Self-cleaning operation of a conventional oven. Establish 
the test conditions set forth in Section 2, ``TEST CONDITIONS,'' of this 
Appendix. Adjust any pilot lights of a conventional gas oven in 
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and turn off the gas 
flow to the conventional cooking top. The temperature of the 
conventional oven shall be its normal nonoperating temperature as 
defined in Section 1.6 and described in Section 2.6. Then set the 
conventional oven's self-cleaning process in accordance with the 
manufacturer's instructions. If the self-cleaning process is adjustable, 
use the average time recommended by the manufacturer for a moderately 
soiled oven.
    3.1.1.2  Continuously burning pilot lights of a conventional gas 
oven. Establish the test conditions set forth in Section 2, ``TEST 
CONDITIONS,'' of this Appendix. Adjust any pilot lights of a 
conventional gas oven in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions 
and turn off the gas flow to the conventional cooking top. If a positive 
displacement gas meter is used the, test duration shall be sufficient to 
measure a gas consumption which is at least 200 times the resolution of 
the gas meter.
    3.1.2  Conventional cooking top. Establish the test conditions set 
forth in Section 2, ``TEST CONDITIONS,'' of this Appendix. Adjust any 
pilot lights of a conventional gas cooking top in accordance with the 
manufacturer's instructions and turn off the gas flow to the 
conventional oven(s), if so equipped. The temperature of the 
conventional cooking top shall be its normal nonoperating temperature as 
defined in Section 1.6 and described in Section 2.6. Set the test block 
in the center of the surface unit under test. The small test block, 
W<INF>2</INF>, shall be used on electric surface units of 7 inches (178 
mm) or less in diameter. The large test block, W<INF>3</INF>, shall be 
used on electric surface units over 7 inches (177.8 mm) in diameter and 
on all gas surface units. Turn on the surface unit under test and set 
its energy input rate to the maximum setting. When the test block 
reaches 144  deg.F (80  deg.C) above its initial test block temperature, 
immediately reduce the energy input rate to 25<plus-minus>5 percent of 
the maximum energy input rate. After 15<plus-minus>0.1 minutes at the 
reduced energy setting, turn off the surface unit under test.
    3.1.2.1  Continuously burning pilot lights of a conventional gas 
cooking top. Establish the test conditions set forth in Section 2, 
``TEST CONDITIONS,'' of this Appendix. Adjust any pilot lights of a 
conventional gas cooking top in accordance with the manufacturer's 
instructions and turn off the gas flow to the conventional oven(s). If a 
positive displacement gas meter is used, the test duration shall be 
sufficient to measure a gas consumption which is at least 200 times the 
resolution of the gas meter.
    3.1.3  Microwave oven.
    3.1.3.1  Microwave oven test energy or power output. Establish the 
testing conditions set forth in Section 2, ``TEST CONDITIONS,'' of this 
Appendix. Follow the test procedure as specified in Section 4, Paragraph 
12.4 of IEC 705 Amendment 2.
    3.2  Test measurements.
    3.2.1  Conventional oven test energy consumption. If the oven 
thermostat controls the oven temperature without cycling on and off, 
measure the energy consumed, E<INF>O</INF>, when the temperature of the 
block reaches T<INF>O</INF> (T<INF>O</INF> is 234  deg.F (130  deg.C) 
above the initial block temperature, T<INF>I</INF>). If the oven 
thermostat operates by cycling on and off, make the following series of 
measurements: Measure the block temperature, T<INF>A</INF>, and the 
energy consumed, E<INF>A</INF>, or volume of gas consumed, 
V<INF>A</INF>, at the end of the last ``ON'' period of the conventional 
oven before the block reaches T<INF>O</INF>. Measure the block 
temperature, T<INF>B</INF>, and the energy consumed, E<INF>B</INF>, or 
volume of gas consumed, V<INF>B</INF>, at the beginning of the next 
``ON'' period. Measure the block temperature, T<INF>C</INF>, and the 
energy consumed, E<INF>C</INF>, or volume of gas consumed, 
V<INF>C</INF>, at the end of that ``ON'' period. Measure the block 
temperature, T<INF>D</INF>, and the energy consumed, E<INF>D</INF>, or 
volume of gas consumed, V<INF>D</INF>, at the beginning of the following 
``ON'' period. Energy measurements for E<INF>O</INF>, E<INF>A</INF>, 
E<INF>B</INF>, E<INF>C</INF> and E<INF>D</INF>, should be expressed in 
watt-hours (kJ) for conventional electric ovens and volume measurements 
for V<INF>A</INF>, V<INF>B</INF>, V<INF>C</INF> and V<INF>D</INF> should 
be expressed in standard cubic feet (L) of gas for conventional gas 
ovens. For a gas oven, measure in watt-hours (kJ) any electrical energy, 
E<INF>IO</INF>, consumed by an ignition device or other electrical 
components required for the operation of a conventional gas oven while 
heating the test block to T<INF>O</INF>. The energy consumed by a 
continuously operating clock that is an integral part of the timing or 
temperature control circuit and cannot be

[[Page 173]]

disconnected during the test may be subtracted from the oven test energy 
to obtain the test energy consumption, E<INF>O</INF> or E<INF>IO</INF>.
    3.2.1.1  Conventional oven average test energy consumption. If the 
conventional oven permits baking by either forced convection or without 
forced convection and the oven thermostat does not cycle on and off, 
measure the energy consumed with the forced convection mode, 
(E<INF>O</INF>)<INF>1</INF>, and without the forced convection mode, 
(E<INF>O</INF>)<INF>2</INF>, when the temperature of the block reaches 
T<INF>O</INF> (T<INF>O</INF> is 234  deg.F (130  deg.C) above the 
initial block temperature, T<INF>I</INF>). If the conventional oven 
permits baking by either forced convection or without forced convection 
and the oven thermostat operates by cycling on and off, make the 
following series of measurements with and without the forced convection 
mode: Measure the block temperature, T<INF>A</INF>, and the energy 
consumed, E<INF>A</INF>, or volume of gas consumed, V<INF>A</INF>, at 
the end of the last ``ON'' period of the conventional oven before the 
block reaches T<INF>O</INF>. Measure the block temperature, 
T<INF>B</INF>, and the energy consumed, E<INF>B</INF>, or volume of gas

of continuously operating clocks, that are an integral part of the 
timing or temperature control circuits and cannot be disconnected during 
testing, shall be multiplied by the applicable test period to calculate 
the clock energy consumption, in watt-hours (kJ), during a test. The 
energy consumed by the clock during the test may then be subtracted from 
the test energy to obtain the specified test energy consumption value.
    3.2.2  Conventional surface unit test energy consumption. For the 
surface unit under test, measure the energy consumption, E<INF>CT</INF>,

device of a gas heating element in watt-hours (kJ). The energy consumed

test may be subtracted from the cooktop test energy to obtain the test 
energy consumption, E<INF>CT</INF> or E<INF>IC</INF>.

the conventional gas cooking top under test has one or more continuously

    2.8.2  For a compact size clothes washer, a three pound test load as 
described in section 2.7.2 shall be used to test the maximum and minimum 
water fill levels.
    2.8.3  A vertical-axis clothes washer without adaptive water fill 
control system also shall be tested without a test load for purposes of 
calculating the energy factor.
    2.8.4  The test load sizes to be used to measure remaining moisture 
content (RMC) are specified in section 3.3.2.
    2.8.5  Load the energy test cloths by grasping them in the center, 
shaking them to hang loosely and then dropping them into the clothes 
container prior to activating the clothes washer.
    2.9  Preconditioning. If the clothes washer has not been filled with 
water in the preceding 96 hours, pre-condition it by running it through 
a cold rinse cycle and then draining it to ensure that the hose, pump, 
and sump are filled with water.
    2.10  Wash time (period of agitation or tumble) setting. If the 
maximum available wash time in the normal cycle is greater than 9.75 
minutes, the wash time shall be not less than 9.75 minutes. If the 
maximum available wash time in the normal cycle is less than 9.75 
minutes, the wash time shall be the maximum available wash time.
    2.11  Agitation speed and spin speed settings. Where controls are 
provided for agitation speed and spin speed selections, set them as 
follows:
    2.11.1  For energy and water consumption tests, set at the normal 
cycle settings. If settings at the normal cycle are not offered, set the 
control settings to the maximum speed permitted on the clothes washer.
    2.11.2  For remaining moisture content tests, see section 3.3.

                          3. TEST MEASUREMENTS

    3.1  Clothes container capacity. Measure the entire volume which a 
dry clothes load could occupy within the clothes container during washer 
operation according to sections 3.1.1 through 3.1.5.
    3.1.1  Place the clothes washer in such a position that the 
uppermost edge of the clothes container opening is leveled horizontally, 
so that the container will hold the maximum amount of water.
    3.1.2  Line the inside of the clothes container with 2 mil (0.051 
mm) plastic sheet. All clothes washer components which occupy space 
within the clothes container and which are recommended for use with the 
energy test cycle shall be in place and shall be lined with 2 mil (0.051 
mm) plastic sheet to prevent water from entering any void space.
    3.1.3  Record the total weight of the machine before adding water.

[[Page 184]]

    3.1.4  Fill the clothes container manually with either 60  deg.F 
<plus-minus>5  deg.F (15.6  deg.C <plus-minus>2.8  deg.C) or 100  deg.F 
<plus-minus>10  deg.F (37.8  deg.C <plus-minus>5.5  deg.C) water to its 
uppermost edge. Measure and record the weight of water, W, in pounds.
    3.1.5  The clothes container capacity is calculated as follows:

C=W/d.

where:

C=Capacity in cubic feet (or liters).
W=Mass of water in pounds (or kilograms).
d=Density of water (62.0 lbs/ft <SUP>3</SUP> for 100  deg.F (993 kg/m 
<SUP>3</SUP> for 37.8  deg.C) or 62.3 lbs/ft <SUP>3</SUP> for 60  deg.F 
(998 kg/m <SUP>3</SUP> for 15.6  deg.C)).

    3.2  Test cycle. Establish the test conditions set forth in section 
2 of this Appendix.
    3.2.1  A clothes washer that has infinite temperature selections 
shall be tested at the following temperature settings: hottest setting 
available on the machine, hot (a minimum of 140  deg.F (60.0  deg.C) and 
a maximum of 145  deg.F (62.8  deg.C)), warm (a minimum of 100  deg.F 
(37.8  deg.C) and a maximum of 105  deg.F (40.6  deg.C)), and coldest 
setting available on the machine. These temperatures must be confirmed 
by measurement using a temperature measuring device. If the measured 
final water temperature is not within the specified range, stop testing, 
adjust the temperature selector accordingly, and repeat the procedure.
    3.2.2  Clothes washers with adaptive water fill control system and/
or unique temperature selections.
    3.2.2.1  Clothes washers with adaptive water fill control system. 
When testing a clothes washer that has adaptive water fill control, the 
maximum and the minimum test loads as specified in 2.8.1 and 2.8.2 shall 
be used. The amount of water fill shall be determined by the control 
system. If the clothes washer provides consumer selection of variable 
water fill amounts for the adaptive water fill control system, two 
complete sets of tests shall be conducted. The first set of tests shall 
be conducted with the adaptive water fill control system set in the 
setting that will use the greatest amount of energy. The second set of 
tests shall be conducted with the adaptive water fill control system set 
in the setting that will use the smallest amount of energy. Then, the 
results from these two tests shall be averaged to determine the adaptive 
water fill energy consumption value. If a clothes washer with an 
adaptive water fill control system allows consumer selection of manual 
controls as an alternative, both the manual and adaptive modes shall be 
tested and the energy consumption values, E<INF>T</INF>, M<INF>E</INF>, 
and D<INF>E</INF> (if desired), calculated in section 4 for each mode, 
shall be averaged between the manual and adaptive modes.
    3.2.2.2  Clothes washers with multiple warm wash temperature 
combination selections.
    3.2.2.2.1  If a clothes washer's temperature combination selections 
are such that the temperature of each warm wash setting that is above 
the mean warm wash temperature (the mean temperature of the coldest and 
warmest warm settings) is matched by a warm wash setting that is an 
equal distance below the mean, then the energy test shall be conducted 
at the mean warm wash temperature if such a selection is provided, or if 
there is no position on the control that permits selection of the mean 
temperature, the energy test shall be conducted with the temperature 
selection set at the next hotter temperature setting that is available 
above the mean.
    3.2.2.2.2  If the multiple warm wash temperature combination 
selections do not meet criteria in section 3.2.2.2.1, the energy test 
shall be conducted with the temperature selection set at the warm wash 
temperature setting that gives the next higher water temperature than 
the mean temperature of the coldest and warmest warm settings.
    3.2.2.3  Clothes washers with multiple temperature settings within a 
temperature combination selection. When a clothes washer is provided 
with a secondary control that can modify the wash or rinse temperature 
within a temperature combination selection, the secondary control shall 
be set to provide the hottest wash temperature available and the hottest 
rinse temperature available. For instance, when the temperature 
combination selection is set for the middle warm wash temperature and a 
secondary control exists which allows this temperature to be increased 
or decreased, the secondary control shall be set to provide the hottest 
warm wash temperature available for the middle warm wash setting.
    3.2.3  Clothes washers that do not lockout any wash/rinse 
temperature combinations in the normal cycle. Test in the normal cycle 
all temperature combination selections that are required to be tested.
    3.2.3.1  Hot water consumption, cold water consumption, and 
electrical energy consumption at maximum fill. Set the water level 
selector at maximum fill available on the clothes washer, if manually 
controlled, and insert the appropriate test load, if applicable. 
Activate the normal cycle of the clothes washer and also any suds-saver 
switch.
    3.2.3.1.1  For automatic clothes washers, set the wash/rinse 
temperature selector to the hottest temperature combination setting. For 
semi-automatic clothes washers, open the hot water faucet valve 
completely and close the cold water faucet valve completely to achieve 
the hottest temperature combination setting.
    3.2.3.1.2  Measure the electrical energy consumption of the clothes 
washer for the complete cycle.

[[Page 185]]

    3.2.3.1.3  Measure the respective number of gallons (or liters) of 
hot and cold water used to fill the tub for the wash cycle.
    3.2.3.1.4  Measure the respective number of gallons (or liters) of 
hot and cold water used for all deep rinse cycles.
    3.2.3.1.5  Measure the respective gallons (or liters) of hot and 
cold water used for all spray rinse cycles.
    3.2.3.1.6  For non-water-heating automatic clothes washers repeat 
sections 3.2.3.1.3 through 3.2.3.1.5 for each of the other wash/rinse 
temperature selections available that uses heated water and is required 
to be tested. For water-heating clothes washers, repeat sections 
3.2.3.1.2 through 3.2.3.1.5 for each of the other wash/rinse temperature 
selections available that uses heated water and is required to be 
tested. (When calculating water consumption under section 4.3 for any 
machine covered by the previous two sentences, also test the cold wash/
cold rinse selection.) For semi-automatic clothes washers, repeat 
sections 3.2.3.1.3 through 3.2.3.1.5 for the other wash/rinse 
temperature settings in section 6 with the following water faucet valve 
adjustments:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                  Faucet position
                                  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  Hot valve                              Cold valve

incorporate a partial fill during the rinse cycle. For clothes washers 
that incorporate a partial fill during the rinse cycle, activate any 
suds-saver switch and operate the clothes washer for the complete normal 
cycle at both the maximum water fill level and the minimum water fill 
level for each of the wash/rinse temperature selections available. 
Measure the respective hot and cold water consumed during the complete 
normal cycle.
    3.2.4  Clothes washers that lockout any wash/rinse temperature 
combinations in the normal cycle. In addition to the normal cycle tests 
in section 3.2.3, perform the following tests on non-normal cycles for 
each wash/rinse temperature combination selection that is locked out in 
the normal cycle.
    3.2.4.1  Set the cycle selector to a non-normal cycle which has the 
wash/rinse temperature combination selection that is locked out. Set the 
water level selector at maximum fill and insert the appropriate test 
load, if applicable. Activate the cycle of the clothes washer and also 
any suds-saver switch. Set the wash/rinse temperature selector to the 
temperature combination setting that is locked out in the normal cycle 
and repeat sections 3.2.3.1.2 through 3.2.3.1.5.
    3.2.4.2  Repeat section 3.2.4.1 under the same temperature 
combination setting for all other untested non-normal cycles on the 
machine that have the wash/rinse temperature combination selection that 
is locked out.
    3.2.4.3  Total the measured hot water consumption of the wash, deep 
rinse, and spray rinse of each non-normal cycle tested in sections 
3.2.4.1 through 3.2.4.2 and compare the total for each cycle. The cycle 
that has the highest hot water consumption shall be the most energy 
intensive cycle for that particular wash/rinse temperature combination 
setting.
    3.2.4.4  Set the water level selector at minimum fill and insert the 
appropriate test load, if applicable. Activate the most energy intensive 
cycle, as determined in section 3.2.4.3, of the clothes washer and also 
any suds-saver switch. Repeat tests as described in section 3.2.4.1.
    3.3    Remaining Moisture Content (RMC).
    3.3.1  The wash temperature shall be the same as the rinse 
temperature for all testing. Cold rinse is the coldest rinse temperature 
available on the machine. Warm rinse is the hottest rinse temperature 
available on the machine.

[[Page 187]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AU97.000

where:

Vh<INF>i</INF>=reported hot water consumption in gallons per cycle (or 
liters per cycle) at maximum fill for each wash/rinse temperature 
combination setting, as provided in section 3.4.2. If a clothes washer 
is equipped with two or more different wash/rinse temperature selections 
that have the same basic temperature combination selection label (for 
example, one of them has its water temperature controlled by 
thermostatically controlled valves and the other one does not), then the 
largest Vh<INF>i</INF> shall be used for this calculation. If a clothes 
washer has lockout(s), there will be ``Vh<INF>i</INF>'s'' for wash/rinse 
temperature combination settings available in the normal cycle and 
``Vh<INF>i</INF>'s'' for wash/rinse temperature combination settings in 
the most energy intensive cycle.
Vh<INF>j</INF>=reported hot water consumption in gallons per cycle (or 
liters per cycle) at minimum fill for each wash/rinse temperature 
combination setting, as provided in section 3.4.3. If a clothes washer 
is equipped with two or more different wash/rinse temperature selections 
that have the same basic temperature combination selection label (for 
example, one of them has its water temperature controlled by 
thermostatically controlled valves and the other one does not), then the 
largest Vh<INF>j</INF> shall be used for the calculation. If a clothes 
washer has lockouts, there will be ``Vh<INF>j</INF>'s'' for wash/rinse 
temperature combination settings available in the normal cycle and 
``Vh<INF>j</INF>'s'' for wash/rinse temperature combination settings in 
the most energy intensive cycle.
L=lockout factor to be applied to the reported hot water consumption. 
For wash/rinse temperature combination settings that are not locked out 
in the normal cycle, L=1. For each wash/rinse temperature combination 
setting that is locked out in the normal cycle, L=0.32 in the normal 
cycle and L=0.68, in the most energy intensive cycle.
TUF<INF>i</INF>=applicable temperature use factor in section 5 or 6.
TUF<INF>j</INF>=applicable temperature use factor in section 5 or 6.
n=number of wash/rinse temperature combination settings available to the 
user for the clothes washer under test. For clothes washers that lockout 
temperature selections in the normal cycle, n=the number of wash/rinse 
temperature combination settings on the washers plus the number of wash/
rinse temperature combination settings that lockout the temperature 
selections in the normal cycle.
TUF<INF>w</INF>=temperature use factor for warm wash setting.

    For clothes washers equipped with the suds-saver feature:

X<INF>1</INF>=frequency of use without the suds-saver feature=0.86.
X<INF>2</INF>=frequency of use with the suds-saver feature=0.14.
Sh<INF>H</INF>=fresh make-up water measured during suds-return cycle at 
maximum water fill level.
Sh<INF>L</INF>=fresh hot make-up water measured during suds-return cycle 
at minimum water fill level.

    For clothes washers not equipped with the suds-saver feature:

X<INF>1</INF>=1.0
X<INF>2</INF>=0.0

    4.1.2  Total per-cycle hot water energy consumption for maximum and 
minimum water fill levels. Calculate the total per-cycle hot water 
energy consumption for the maximum water fill level, E<INF>max</INF> and 
for the minimum water fill level, E<INF>min</INF>, expressed in 
kilowatt-hours per cycle and defined as:

E<INF>max</INF>=[Vh<INF>max</INF>xTxKxMF]

E<INF>min</INF>=[Vh<INF>min</INF>xTxKxMF]

where:

T=temperature rise=90  deg.F (50  deg.C).
K=water specific heat=0.00240 kWh/(gal-  deg.F) [0.00114kWh/(L- 
deg.C)].
Vh<INF>max</INF>=as defined in section 4.1.1.
Vh<INF>min</INF>=as defined in section 4.1.1.
MF=multiplying factor to account for absence of test load=0.94 for top-
loader vertical axis clothes washers that are sensor filled, 1.0 for all 
other clothes washers.

                      7. WAIVERS AND FIELD TESTING

    7.1  Waivers and Field Testing for Non-conventional Clothes Washers. 
Manufacturers of non-conventional clothes washers, such as clothes 
washers with adaptive control systems, must submit a petition for waiver 
pursuant to 10 CFR 430.27 to establish an acceptable test procedure for 
that clothes washer. For these and other clothes washers that have 
controls or systems such that the DOE

[[Page 191]]

test procedures yield results that are so unrepresentative of the 
clothes washer's true energy consumption characteristics as to provide 
materially inaccurate comparative data, field testing may be appropriate 
for establishing an acceptable test procedure. The following are 
guidelines for field testing which may be used by manufacturers in 
support of petitions for waiver. These guidelines are not mandatory and 
the Department may determine that they do not apply to a particular 
model. Depending upon a manufacturer's approach for conducting field 
testing, additional data may be required. Manufacturers are encouraged 
to communicate with the Department prior to the commencement of field 
tests which may be used to support a petition for waiver. Section 7.3 
provides an example of field testing for a clothes washer with an 
adaptive water fill control system. Other features, such as the use of 
various spin speed selections, could be the subject of field tests.
    7.2  Non-conventional Wash System Energy Consumption Test. The field 
test may consist of a minimum of 10 of the nonconventional clothes 
washers (``test clothes washers'') and 10 clothes washers already being 
distributed in commerce (``base clothes washers''). The tests should 
include a minimum of 50 normal test cycles per clothes washer. The test 
clothes washers and base clothes washers should be identical in 
construction except for the controls or systems being tested. Equal 
numbers of both the test clothes washer and the base clothes washer 
should be tested simultaneously in comparable settings to minimize 
seasonal and/or consumer laundering conditions and/or variations. The 
clothes washers should be monitored in such a way as to accurately 
record the total energy consumption per cycle. At a minimum, the 
following should be measured and recorded throughout the test period for 
each clothes washer: Hot water usage in gallons (or liters), electrical 
energy usage in kilowatt-hours, and the cycles of usage. The field test 
results would be used to determine the best method to correlate the 
rating of the test clothes washer to the rating of the base clothes 
washer. If the base clothes washer is rated at A kWh per year, but field 
tests at B kWh per year, and the test clothes washer field tests at D 
kWh per year, the test unit would be rated as follows:

Ax(D/B)=G kWh per year

    7.3  Adaptive water fill control system field test. Section 3.2.2.1 
defines the test method for measuring energy consumption for clothes 
washers which incorporate control systems having both adaptive and 
alternate manual selections. Energy consumption calculated by the method 
defined in section 3.2.2.1 assumes the adaptive cycle will be used 50 
percent of the time. This section can be used to develop field test data 
in support of a petition for waiver when it is believed that the 
adaptive cycle will be used more than 50 percent of the time. The field 
test sample size should be a minimum of 10 test clothes washers. The 
test clothes washers should be totally representative of the design, 
construction, and control system that will be placed in commerce. The 
duration of field testing in the user's house should be a minimum of 50 
normal test cycles, for each unit. No special instructions as to cycle 
selection or product usage should be given to the field test 
participants, other than inclusion of the product literature pack which 
should be shipped with all units, and instructions regarding filling out 
data collection forms, use of data collection equipment, or basic 
procedural methods. Prior to the test clothes washers being installed in 
the field test locations, baseline data should be developed for all 
field test units by conducting laboratory tests as defined by section 1 
through section 6 of these test procedures to determine the energy 
consumption values. The following data should be measured and recorded 
for each wash load during the test period: wash cycle selected, the mode 
of the clothes washer (adaptive or manual), clothes load dry weight 
(measured after the clothes washer and clothes dryer cycles are 
completed) in pounds, and type of articles in the clothes load (i.e., 
cottons, linens, permanent press, etc.). The wash loads used in 
calculating the in-home percentage split between adaptive and manual 
cycle usage should be only those wash loads which conform to the 
definition of the normal test cycle.
    Calculate:

T=The total number of normal test cycles run during the field test
T<INF>a</INF>=The total number of adaptive control normal test cycles
T<INF>m</INF>=The total number of manual control normal test cycles

    The percentage weighting factors:

P<INF>a</INF>=(T<INF>a</INF>/T) x 100 (the percentage weighting for 
adaptive control selection)
P<INF>m</INF>=(T<INF>m</INF>/T) x 100 (the percentage weighting for 
manual control selection)

    Energy consumption values, E<INF>T</INF>, M<INF>E</INF>, and 
D<INF>E</INF> (if desired) calculated in section 4 for the manual and 
adaptive modes, should be combined using P<INF>a</INF> and P<INF>m</INF> 
as the weighting factors.

Appendix J1 to Subpart B of Part 430--Uniform Test Method for Measuring 
 the Energy Consumption of Automatic and Semi-Automatic Clothes Washers

    Note: Appendix J1 to Subpart B of part 430 is informational. It will 
not be used for determining compliance with standards, or as a basis for 
representations, until amended energy conservation standards for clothes 
washers at 10 CFR 430.32(g) become effective.

                       1. DEFINITIONS AND SYMBOLS

    1.1  Adaptive control system means a clothes washer control system, 
other than an adaptive water fill control system, which is capable of 
automatically adjusting washer operation or washing conditions based on 
characteristics of the clothes load placed in the clothes container, 
without allowing or requiring consumer intervention or actions. The 
automatic adjustments may, for example, include automatic selection, 
modification, or control of any of the following: wash water 
temperature, agitation or tumble cycle time, number of rinse cycles, and 
spin speed. The characteristics of the clothes load, which could trigger 
such adjustments, could, for example, consist of or be indicated by the 
presence of either soil, soap, suds, or any other additive laundering 
substitute or complementary product.
    Note: Appendix J1 does not provide a means for determining the 
energy consumption of a clothes washer with an adaptive control system. 
Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 430.27, a waiver must be obtained to 
establish an acceptable test procedure for each such clothes washer.
    1.2  Adaptive water fill control system means a clothes washer water 
fill control system which is capable of automatically adjusting the 
water fill level based on the size or weight of the clothes load placed 
in the clothes container, without allowing or requiring consumer 
intervention or actions.
    1.3  Bone-dry means a condition of a load of test cloth which has 
been dried in a dryer at maximum temperature for a minimum of 10 
minutes, removed and weighed before cool down, and then dried again for 
10 minute periods until the final weight change of the load is 1 percent 
or less.
    1.4  Clothes container means the compartment within the clothes 
washer that holds the clothes during the operation of the machine.
    1.5  Compact means a clothes washer which has a clothes container 
capacity of less than 1.6 ft<SUP>3</SUP> (45 L).
    1.6  Deep rinse cycle means a rinse cycle in which the clothes 
container is filled with water to a selected level and the clothes load 
is rinsed by agitating it or tumbling it through the water.
    1.7  Energy test cycle for a basic model means (A) the cycle 
recommended by the manufacturer for washing cotton or linen clothes, and 
includes all wash/rinse temperature selections and water levels offered 
in that cycle, and (B) for each other wash/rinse temperature selection 
or water level available on that basic model, the portion(s) of other 
cycle(s) with that temperature selection or water level that, when 
tested pursuant to these test procedures, will contribute to an accurate 
representation of the energy consumption of the basic model as used by 
consumers. Any cycle under (A) or (B) shall include the agitation/tumble 
operation, spin speed(s), wash times, and rinse times applicable to that 
cycle, including water heating time for water heating clothes washers.

when the water temperatures are plotted against equally spaced 
consecutive warm wash selections between the hottest warm wash and the 
coldest warm wash. If the warm wash has infinite selections, the warm 
wash water temperature has a linear relationship with the distance on

relationship as specified above is that the difference between the 
actual water temperature at any warm wash selection and the point where 
that temperature is depicted on the temperature/selection line formed by 
connecting the warmest and the coldest warm selections is less than 
<plus-minus>5 percent. In all cases, the mean water temperature of the 
warmest and the coldest warm selections must coincide with the mean of 
the ``hot wash'' (maximum wash temperature [le]135  deg.F (57.2  deg.C))

    3.1  Clothes container capacity. Measure the entire volume which a 
dry clothes load could occupy within the clothes container during washer 
operation according to the following procedures:
    3.1.1  Place the clothes washer in such a position that the 
uppermost edge of the clothes container opening is leveled horizontally, 
so that the container will hold the maximum amount of water.
    3.1.2  Line the inside of the clothes container with 2 mil (0.051 
mm) plastic sheet. All clothes washer components which occupy space 
within the clothes container and which are recommended for use with the 
energy test cycle shall be in place and shall be lined with 2 mil (0.051 
mm) plastic sheet to prevent water from entering any void space.
    3.1.3  Record the total weight of the machine before adding water.
    3.1.4  Fill the clothes container manually with either 60 
deg.F<plus-minus>5  deg.F (15.6  deg.C<plus-minus>2.8  deg.C) or 100 
deg.F<plus-minus>10  deg.F (37.8  deg.C<plus-minus>5.5  deg.C) water to 
its uppermost edge. Measure and record the weight of water, W, in 
pounds.
    3.1.5  The clothes container capacity is calculated as follows:

C=W/d.

where:

C=Capacity in cubic feet (liters).
W=Mass of water in pounds (kilograms).
d=Density of water (62.0 lbs/ft\3\ for 100  deg.F (993 kg/m\3\ for 37.8 
deg.C) or 62.3 lbs/ft\3\ for 60  deg.F (998 kg/m\3\ for 15.6  deg.C)).

    3.2  Procedure for measuring water and energy consumption values on 
all automatic and semi-automatic washers. All energy consumption tests 
shall be performed under the energy test cycle(s), unless otherwise 
specified. Table 3.2 defines the sections below which govern tests of 
particular clothes washers, based on the number of wash/rinse 
temperature selections available on the model, and also, in some 
instances, method of water heating. The procedures prescribed are 
applicable regardless of a clothes washer's washing capacity, loading 
port location, primary axis of rotation of the clothes container, and 
type of control system.
    3.2.1  Inlet water temperature and the wash/rinse temperature 
settings.
    3.2.1.1  For automatic clothes washers set the wash/rinse 
temperature selection control to obtain the wash water temperature 
desired (extra hot, hot, warm, or cold) and cold rinse, and open both 
the hot and cold water faucets.
    3.2.1.2  For semi-automatic washers: (1) For hot water temperature, 
open the hot water faucet completely and close the cold water faucet; 
(2) for warm inlet water temperature, open both hot and cold water 
faucets completely; (3) for cold water temperature, close the hot water 
faucet and open the cold water faucet completely.
    3.2.1.3  Determination of warm wash water temperature(s) to decide 
whether a clothes washer has uniformly distributed warm wash temperature 
selections. The wash water temperature, Tw, of each warm water wash 
selection shall be calculated or measured.
    For non-water-heating clothes washers, calculate Tw as follows:

Tw(  deg.F)=((Hwx135  deg.F)+(Cwx60  deg.F))/(Hw+Cw)

    or

Tw(  deg.C)=((Hwx57.2  deg.C)+(Cwx15.6  deg.C))/(Hw+Cw)

where:

Hw=Hot water consumption of a warm wash
Cw=Cold water consumption of a warm wash

    For water-heating clothes washers, measure and record the 
temperature of each warm wash selection after fill.
    3.2.2  Total water consumption during the energy test cycle shall be 
measured, including hot and cold water consumption during wash, deep 
rinse, and spray rinse.
    3.2.3  Clothes washers with adaptive water fill/manual water fill 
control systems
    3.2.3.1  Clothes washers with adaptive water fill control system and 
alternate manual water fill control systems. If a clothes washer with an 
adaptive water fill control system allows consumer selection of manual 
controls as an alternative, then both manual and adaptive modes shall be 
tested and, for each mode, the

[[Page 196]]

energy consumption (HE<INF>T</INF>, ME<INF>T</INF>, and D<INF>E</INF>) 
and water consumption (Q<INF>T</INF>), values shall be calculated as set 
forth in section 4. Then the average of the two values (one from each 
mode, adaptive and manual) for each variable shall be used in section 4 
for the clothes washer.
    3.2.3.2  Clothes washers with adaptive water fill control system.
    3.2.3.2.1.  Not user adjustable. The maximum, minimum, and average 
water levels as defined in the following sections shall be interpreted 
to mean that amount of water fill which is selected by the control 
system when the respective test loads are used, as defined in Table 2.8. 
The load usage factors which shall be used when calculating energy 
consumption values are defined in Table 4.1.3.
    3.2.3.2.2  User adjustable. Four tests shall be conducted on clothes 
washers with user adjustable adaptive water fill controls which affect 
the relative wash water levels. The first test shall be conducted with 
the maximum test load and with the adaptive water fill control system 
set in the setting that will give the most energy intensive result. The 
second test shall be conducted with the minimum test load and with the 
adaptive water fill control system set in the setting that will give the 
least energy intensive result. The third test shall be conducted with 
the average test load and with the adaptive water fill control system 
set in the setting that will give the most energy intensive result for 
the given test load. The fourth test shall be conducted with the average 
test load and with the adaptive water fill control system set in the 
setting that will give the least energy intensive result for the given 
test load. The energy and water consumption for the average test load 
and water level, shall be the average of the third and fourth tests.
    3.2.3.3  Clothes washers with manual water fill control system. In 
accordance with Table 2.8, the water fill selector shall be set to the 
maximum water level available on the clothes washer for the maximum test 
load size and set to the minimum water level for the minimum test load 
size. The load usage factors which shall be used when calculating energy 
consumption values are defined in Table 4.1.3.

conducted with the hottest rinse temperature available. If multiple wash 
temperatures are available with the hottest rinse temperature, any 
``warm wash'' temperature may be selected to conduct the tests.
    3.7.1  For the rinse only, measure the amount of hot water consumed 
by the clothes washer including all deep and spray rinses, for the 
maximum (R<INF>x</INF>), minimum (R<INF>n</INF>), and, if required by

                      6. WAIVERS AND FIELD TESTING

    6.1  Waivers and Field Testing for Non-conventional Clothes Washers. 
Manufacturers of nonconventional clothes washers, such as clothes 
washers with adaptive control systems, must submit a petition for waiver 
pursuant to 10 CFR 430.27 to establish an acceptable test procedure for 
that clothes washer. For these and other clothes washers that have 
controls or systems such that the DOE test procedures yield results that 
are so unrepresentative of the clothes washer's true energy consumption 
characteristics as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data, 
field testing may be appropriate for establishing an acceptable test 
procedure. The following are guidelines for field testing which may be 
used by manufacturers in support of petitions for waiver. These 
guidelines are not mandatory and the Department may determine that they 
do not apply to a particular model. Depending upon a manufacturer's 
approach for conducting field testing, additional data may be required. 
Manufacturers are encouraged to communicate with the Department prior to 
the commencement of field tests which may be used to support a petition 
for waiver. Section 6.3 provides an example of field testing for a 
clothes washer with an adaptive water fill control system. Other 
features, such as the use of various spin speed selections, could be the 
subject of field tests.
    6.2  Nonconventional Wash System Energy Consumption Test. The field 
test may consist of a minimum of 10 of the nonconventional clothes 
washers (``test clothes washers'') and 10 clothes washers already being 
distributed in commerce (``base clothes washers''). The tests should 
include a minimum of 50 energy test cycles per clothes washer. The test 
clothes washers and base clothes washers should be identical in 
construction except for the controls or systems being tested. Equal 
numbers of both the test clothes washer and the base clothes washer 
should be tested simultaneously in comparable settings to minimize 
seasonal or consumer laundering conditions or variations. The clothes 
washers should be monitored in such a way as to accurately record the 
total energy consumption per cycle. At a minimum, the following should 
be measured and recorded throughout the test period for each clothes 
washer: Hot water usage in gallons (or liters), electrical energy usage 
in kilowatt-hours, and the cycles of usage.
    The field test results would be used to determine the best method to 
correlate the rating of the test clothes washer to the rating of the 
base clothes washer. If the base clothes washer is rated at A kWh per 
year, but field tests at B kWh per year, and the test clothes washer 
field tests at D kWh per year, the test unit would be rated as follows:

Ax(D/B)=G kWh per year

    6.3  Adaptive water fill control system field test. Section 3.2.3.1 
defines the test method for measuring energy consumption for clothes 
washers which incorporate control systems having both adaptive and 
alternate cycle selections. Energy consumption calculated by the method 
defined in section 3.2.3.1 assumes the adaptive cycle will be used 50 
percent of the time. This section can be used to develop field test data 
in support of a petition for waiver when it is believed that the 
adaptive cycle will be used more than 50 percent of the time. The field 
test sample size should be a minimum of 10 test clothes washers. The 
test clothes washers should be totally representative of the design, 
construction, and control system that will be placed in commerce. The 
duration of field testing in the user's house should be a minimum of 50 
energy test cycles, for each

[[Page 202]]

unit. No special instructions as to cycle selection or product usage 
should be given to the field test participants, other than inclusion of 
the product literature pack which would be shipped with all units, and 
instructions regarding filling out data collection forms, use of data 
collection equipment, or basic procedural methods. Prior to the test 
clothes washers being installed in the field test locations, baseline 
data should be developed for all field test units by conducting 
laboratory tests as defined by section 1 through section 5 of these test 
procedures to determine the energy consumption, water consumption, and 
remaining moisture content values. The following data should be measured 
and recorded for each wash load during the test period: wash cycle 
selected, the mode of the clothes washer (adaptive or manual), clothes 
load dry weight (measured after the clothes washer and clothes dryer 
cycles are completed) in pounds, and type of articles in the clothes 
load (e.g., cottons, linens, permanent press). The wash loads used in 
calculating the in-home percentage split between adaptive and manual 
cycle usage should be only those wash loads which conform to the 
definition of the energy test cycle.
    Calculate:

T=The total number of energy test cycles run during the field test
T<INF>a</INF>=The total number of adaptive control energy test cycles
T<INF>m</INF>=The total number of manual control energy test cycles

    The percentage weighting factors:

P<INF>a</INF>=(T<INF>a</INF>/T)x100 (the percentage weighting for 
adaptive control selection)
P<INF>m</INF>=(T<INF>m</INF>/T)x100 (the percentage weighting for manual 
control selection)

    Energy consumption (HE<INF>T</INF>, ME<INF>T</INF>, and 
D<INF>E</INF>) and water consumption (Q<INF>T</INF>), values calculated 
in section 4 for the manual and adaptive modes, should be combined using 
P<INF>a</INF> and P<INF>m</INF> as the weighting factors.

    2.6.5.1  The standard extractor RMC tests shall be run in a Bock 
Model 215 extractor (having a basket diameter of 19.5 inches, length of 
12 inches, and volume of 2.1 ft<SUP>3</SUP>), with a variable speed 
drive (Bock Engineered Products, P.O. Box 5127, Toledo, OH 43611) or an 
equivalent extractor with same basket design (i.e. diameter, length, 
volume, and hole configuration) and variable speed drive.
    2.6.5.2 Test Load. Test cloths shall be preconditioned in accordance 
with 2.6.3 of this appendix. The load size shall be 8.4 lbs., consistent 
with 3.8.1 of this appendix.
    2.6.5.3  Procedure.
    2.6.5.3.1  Record the ``bone-dry'' weight of the test load (WI).
    2.6.5.3.2  Soak the test load for 20 minutes in 10 gallons of soft 
(<17 ppm) water. The entire test load shall be submerged. The water 
temperature shall be 100  deg.F <plus-minus> 5  deg.F.
    2.6.5.3.3  Remove the test load and allow water to gravity drain off 
of the test cloths. Then manually place the test cloths in the basket of 
the extractor, distributing them evenly by eye. Spin the load at a fixed 
speed corresponding to the intended centripetal acceleration level 
(measured in units of the acceleration of gravity, g) <plus-minus>1 g 
for the intended time period <plus-minus>5 seconds.
    2.6.5.3.4  Record the weight of the test load immediately after the 
completion of the extractor spin cycle (WC).
    2.6.5.3.5  Calculate the RMC as (WC-WI)/WI.
    2.6.5.3.6  The RMC of the test load shall be measured at three (3) g 
levels: 50g; 200g; and 350g, using two different spin times at each g

                           2. testing required

    2.1  Testing required for air source cooling only units. Two steady 
state wet coil tests required to be performed, test A and test B. Test A 
is to be conducted as an outdoor dry bulb temperature of 95  deg. F and 
test B at 82  deg. F. Test C and D are optional tests to be conducted 
when cyclic performance parameters are to be measured in order to 
determine the degradation coefficient, C<SUP>D</SUP> Test C is a steady 
state dry coil test conducted at an outdoor dry bulb temperature of 82 
deg. F. Test D is a cyclic test also conducted at an outdoor dry bulb 
temperature of 82  deg. F. In lieu of conducting tests C and D, an 
assigned value of 0.25 may be used for the degradation coefficient, 
C<SUP>D</SUP>.
    2.1.1  Testing required for units with single speed compressors and 
single speed condenser fans. Test A and test B shall be performed 
according to the test procedures outlined in 4.1 of this Appendix. In 
addition, the cyclic performance shall be evaluated by conducting test C 
and D according to the requirements outlined in 4.1 of this Appendix.
    2.1.2  Testing required for units with single speed compressors and 
multiple-speed condenser fans. The test requirements for multiple-speed 
condenser fan units shall be the same as described in section 2.1.1 for 
single speed condensor fan units.
    2.1.3  Testing required for units with two-speed compressors, two 
compressors, or cylinder unloading. The test requirements for two-speed 
compressor units, two compressor units, or units with cylinder unloading 
are the same as described in 2.1.1 of this Appendix except that test A 
and test B shall be performed at each compressor speed or at each 
compressor capacity.
    2.1.4  Testing required for units with two-speed compressors, two 
compressors, or cylinder unloading capable of varying the sensible to 
total (S/T) capacity ratio. When a unit employing a two-speed 
compressor, two compressors, or cylinder unloading provides a method of 
varying the ratio of the sensible cooling capacity to the total cooling 
capacity, (S/T), the test requirements are the same as for two-speed 
compressor units as described in 2.1.3 of this Appendix.
    2.1.5  Testing required for units with triple-capacity compressors. 
(Reserved)
    2.1.6  Testing required for units with variable-speed compressors. 
The tests for variable-speed equipment consist of five (5) wet coil 
tests and two (2) dry coil tests. Two of the wet coil tests, A and B, 
are conducted at the maximum speed. Two wet coil tests, B<INF>2</INF> 
and low temperature test, are conducted at the minimum speed. The fifth 
wet coil test is conducted at an intermediate speed. Dry coil tests, C 
and D, are conducted at the minimum speed if the coefficient of 
degradation (C<INF>D</INF>) value of 0.25 is not adopted. The test 
conditions and procedures for the above are outlined in sections 3.1 and 
4.1 of this Appendix.
    2.1.7  Testing required for split-type ductless systems. The tests 
for split-type ductless systems are determined by the type of compressor 
installed in the outdoor unit. For the appropriate tests refer to 
sections 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3, 2.1.4, 2.1.5, or 2.1.6 of this Appendix.
    2.2  Testing required for air source heating only units. Four types 
of tests are required to be performed: High Temperature, Cyclic, Frost 
Accumulation, and Low Temperature. In lieu of conducting the Cyclic Test 
an assigned value of 0.25 may be used for the degradation coefficient, 
C<SUP>D</SUP>.
    2.2.1  Testing required for units with single speed compressors. 
Units with single speed compressors shall be subjected respectively to 
the High Temperature Test at 47  deg. F described in section 3.2.1.1, 
the Cyclic Test as described in section 3.2.1.2, the Frost Accumulation 
Test as described in section 3.2.1.3, and the Low Temperature Test as 
described in section 3.2.1.4.
    2.2.2  Testing required for units with two-speed compressors, two 
compressors, or cylinder unloading. With the unit operating: at high 
compressors speed (two-speed compressor), with both compressors in 
operation (two-compressors), or at the maximum capacity (cylinder 
unloading); the following tests are required to be performed on all 
units; the High Temperature Test at 47  deg. F, the Frost Accumulation 
Test, and the Low Temperature Test. An additional test (cyclic at 47 
deg. F)

[[Page 207]]

is required, with the unit operating at the high compressor speed (two-
speed compressor), with both compressors in operation (two compressors), 
or at the maximum capacity (cylinder unloading); if the normal mode of 
operation requires cycling ``on'' and ``off'' of the compressor(s) at 
high speed or maximum capacity.
    With the unit operating: at the low compressor speed (two-speed 
compressor), with the single compressor which normally operates at low 
loads (two compressors), or at the low compressor capacity (cylinder 
unloading); the following tests are required to be performed on all 
units: the High Temperature Test at 47  deg. F, the High Temperature 
Test at 62  deg. F, and the Cyclic Test. Additional tests, (Frost 
Accumulation Test and Low Temperature Test) are required, with the unit 
operating: on low compressor speed (two-speed compressor), with the 
single compressor which normally operates at low loads (two compressors) 
or at the low compressor capacity (cylinder unloading), if the unit's 
low speed, one compressor or low capacity performance at and below 40 
deg. F is needed to calculate its seasonal performance.
    2.2.3  Testing required for units with triple-capacity compressors. 
(Reserved)
    2.2.4  Testing required for units with variable-speed compressors. 
There are seven basic tests and one optional test for variable-speed 
units. Three tests (high temperature test, low temperature test, and 
frost accumulation test) are performed at the maximum speed. Three tests 
(two high temperature and one cyclic test) are performed with the unit 
operating at minimum speed. A second frost accumulation test is 
performed at an intermediate speed. The intermediate speed is the same 
as in the cooling mode.
    In lieu of the maximum speed frost accumulation test, two equations 
are provided in section 4.2 of this Appendix. In lieu of the cyclic test 
an assigned value of 0.25 may be used for the coefficient of degradation 
C<INF>D</INF>. The optional test is a nominal capacity test applicable 
to units which have a heating mode maximum speed greater than the 
cooling mode maximum speed. The conditions and procedures for the above 
tests are described in sections 3.2 and 4.2 respectively, of this 
Appendix.
    2.2.5  Testing required for split-type ductless system. The type of 
compressor installed in the outdoor unit determines the testing 
required, refer to previous sections 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3, or 2.2.4. The 
conditions and procedures will be modified as indicated for the various 
types as stated in sections 3.2 and 4.2 respectively.
    2.3  Testing required for air source units which provide both 
heating and cooling. The requirements for units which provide both 
heating and cooling shall be the same as the requirements in Section 
2.1. and 2.2 of this Appendix.

                          3. testing conditions

    3.1  Testing conditions for air source cooling only units. The test 
room requirement and equipment installation procedures are the same as 
those specified in sections 11.1 and 11.2 of ASHRAE Standard 37-78. 
Units designed for both horizontal and vertical installation shall be 
tested in the orientation in which they are most frequently installed. 
All tests shall be performed at the normal residential voltage and 
frequency for which the equipment is designed (either 115 or 230 volts 
and 60 hertz), the test installation shall be designed such that there 
will be no air flow through the cooling coil due to natural or forced 
convection while the indoor fan is ``off''. This shall be accomplished 
by installing dampers upstream and downstream of the test unit to block 
the off period air flow. Values of capacity for rating purposes are to 
be rounded off to the nearest 100 Btu/hour for capacities less than 
20,000 Btu/hour; to the nearest 200 Btu/hour for capacities between 
20,000 and 37,999 Btu/hour; and to the nearest 500 Btu/hour for 
capacities between 38,000 and 64,999 Btu/hour.
    The following conditions listed in ARI Standard 210.79 shall apply 
to all tests performed in Section 3.1 of this Appendix:

5.1.3.4  Cooling Coil Air Quantity.
5.1.3.6  Requirements for Separated Assemblies.
3.1.1  Testing conditions for units with single speed compressors and 
single speed condenser fans.
    3.1.1.1  Steady state wet-coil performance tests (Test A and Test 
B). Test A and test B shall be performed with the air entering the 
indoor side of the unit having a dry-bulb temperature of 80  deg. F and 
a wet-bulb temperature of 87  deg. F. The dry-bulb temperature of the 
air entering the outdoor side of the unit shall be 95  deg. F in test A 
and 82  deg. F in test B. The temperature of the air surrounding the 
outdoor side of the unit in each test shall be the same as the outdoor 
entering air temperature except for units or sections thereof intended 
to be installed only indoors, in which case the dry-bulb temperature 
surrounding that indoor side of the unit shall be 80  deg. F. For those 
units which reject condensate to the condenser, located in the outdoor 
side of the unit, the outdoor wet-bulb temperature surrounding the 
outdoor side of the unit shall be 75  deg. F in test A and 65  deg. F in 
test B.
    3.1.1.2  Steady state dry coil performance test (Test C) and cyclic 
dry coil performance test (Test D). Test C and test D shall be performed 
with the air entering the indoor side of the unit having a dry-bulb 
temperature of 80  deg. F and a wet-bulb temperature which does not 
result in formation of condensate on the indoor coil. (It is recommended 
that an indoor wet-bulb temperature of 57  deg. F or less be used.) The 
dry-bulb temperature of the air

[[Page 208]]

entering the outdoor portion of the unit shall be 82  deg. F. The 
outdoor portion of the unit shall be subject to the same conditions as 
the requirements for conducting test B as stated previously in section 
3.1.1.1. Test C shall be conducted with the unit operating steadily. 
Test D shall be conducted by cycling the unit ``on'' and ``off'' by 
manual or automatic operation of the normal control circuit of the unit. 
The unit shall cycle with the compressor ``on'' for 6 minutes and 
``off'' for 24 minutes. The indoor fan shall also cycle ``on'' and 
``off'', the duration of the indoor fan ``on'' and ``off'' periods being 
governed by the automatic controls which the manufacturer normally 
supplies with the unit. The results of tests C and D shall be used to 
calculate a degradation coefficient, C<INF>D</INF> by the procedures 
outlined in 5.1 of this Appendix.
    3.1.2  Testing conditions for units with single speed compressors 
and multiple-speed condenser fans. The condenser fan speed to be used in 
test A shall be that speed which normally occurs at an outdoor dry-bulb 
temperature of 95  deg. F, and for test B, the fan speed shall be that 
which normally occurs at an outdoor dry-bulb temperature of 82  deg. F. 
If elected to be performed, tests C and D shall be conducted at the same 
condenser fan speed as in test B.
    3.1.3  Testing conditions for units with two-speed compressors, two 
compressors, or cylinder unloading. The condenser fan speed used in 
conducting test A at each compressor speed shall be that which normally 
occurs at an outdoor dry-bulb temperature of 95  deg. F. For test B, the 
condenser fan speed at each compressor speed shall be that which 
normally occurs at an outdoor dry-bulb temperature of 82  deg. F. If 
elected to be performed, tests C and D shall be conducted at the low 
compressor speed with the same condenser fan speed as used in test B. 
For those two-speed units in which the normal mode of operation involves 
cycling the compressor ``on'' and ``off'' at high speed, tests C and D 
shall also be performed with the compressor operating at high speed and 
at a condenser fan speed that normally occurs at test A ambient 
conditions. Units consisting of two compressors are subject to the same 
requirements as those units containing two-speed compressors, except 
that when operated at high speed, both compressors shall be operating 
and when operating at low speed, only the compressor which normally 
operates at an outdoor dry-bulb temperature of 82  deg. F shall be 
operating.
    In lieu of conducting tests C and D, an assigned value of 0.25 may 
be used for the degradation coefficient, C<INF>D</INF> , at each 
compressor speed. If the assigned degradation coefficient is used for 
one compressor speed it must also be used for the other compressor 
speed.
    In the case of units with cylinder unloading, the loaded and the 
unloaded conditions correspond to high and low compressor speed on two-
speed units respectively.
    3.1.4  Testing conditions for units with two-speed compressors, two 
compressors, or cylinder unloading capable of varying the sensible to 
total (S/T) capacity ratio. The mode of operation selected for 
controlling the S/T ratio in the performance of test A and test B at 
each compressor speed shall be such that it does not result in an 
operating configuration which is not typical of a normal residential 
installation. If elected to be performed, tests C and D shall be 
conducted at low compressor speed (single compressor operating) with the 
same S/T control mode as used in test B when performed at the low 
compressor speed. Likewise, tests C and D shall also be conducted at 
high compressor speed (two compressors operating) and with the same S/T 
control mode as in test A when performed at the high compressor speed.
    In the case of units with cylinder unloading, the loaded and 
unloaded conditions correspond to high and low compressor speed on two-
speed units respectively.
    3.1.5  Testing conditions for units with triple-capacity 
compressors. (Reserved)
    3.1.6  Additional testing conditions for cooling-only units with 
variable-speed compressors. For cooling-only units and air-source heat 
pumps with varaible-speed compressors, the air flow rate at fan speeds 
less than the maximum fan speed shall be determined by using the fan law 
for a fixed resistance system. The air flow rate is given by the ratio 
of the actual fan speed to the maximum fan speed multiplied by the air 
flow rate at the maximum fan speed. Minimum static pressure requirements 
only apply when the fan is running at the maximum speed.
    3.1.6.1  Testing conditions for steady-state wet coil tests. Tests A 
and B shall be performed at the maximum speed at conditions specified in 
section 3.1.1 of this Appendix. Test B<INF>2</INF> and the low 
temperature test are performed at the minimum speed with outdoor dry 
bulb temperatures of 82  deg.F and 67  deg.F respectively. The 
intermediate speed wet coil test is performed at the outdoor dry bulb 
temperature of 87  deg.F. For units which reject condensate the outdoor 
wet bulb temperature shall be maintained at 75  deg.F for Test A, 65 
deg.F for Tests B and B<INF>2</INF>, 53.5  deg.F for the low temperature 
test and 69  deg.F for the intermediate test. The indoor conditions for 
all wet coil tests are the same as those given in section 3.1.1 of this 
Appendix.
    3.1.6.2  Test conditions for dry coil tests. Dry coil Tests C and D 
are conducted at an outdoor dry bulb temperature of 67  deg.F. For units 
which reject condensate the outdoor wet bulb temperature shall be 
maintained at 53.5  deg.F. The indoor dry bulb temperature shall be 80 
deg.F and the wet bulb temperature shall be sufficiently low so no 
condensation occurs on the evaporator (It is recommended that an

[[Page 209]]

indoor wet bulb temperature of 57  deg.F or less be used).
    3.1.7  Split-type ductless systems. Test conditions shall be the 
same as those specified for the same single outdoor unit compressor 
type, assuming it was matched with a single indoor coil.
    3.1.7.1  Interconnection. For split-type ductless systems, all 
standard rating tests shall be performed with a minimum length of 25 
feet of interconnecting tubing between each indoor fan-coil unit and the 
common outdoor unit. Such equipment in which the interconnection tubing 
is furnished as an integral part of the machine not recommended for 
cutting to length shall be tested with complete length of tubing 
furnished, or with 25 feet of tubing, whichever is greater. At least 10 
feet of the interconnection tubing shall be exposed to the outside 
conditions. The line sizes, insulation and details of installation shall 
be in accordance with the manufacturer's published recommendation.
    3.1.7.2  Control testing conditions for split-type ductless systems. 
For split-type ductless systems, a single control circuit shall be 
substituted for any multiple thermostats in order to maintain a uniform 
cycling rate during test D and the high temperature heating cyclic test. 
During the steady-state tests, all thermostats shall be shunted 
resulting in all indoor fan-coil units being in operation.
    3.1.7.3  Split-type ductless systems with multiple coils or multiple 
discharge outlets shall have short plenums attached to each outlet. Each 
plenum shall discharge into a single common duct section, the duct 
section in turn discharging into the air measuring device (or a suitable 
dampering device when direct air measurement is not employed). Each 
plenum shall have an adjustable restrictor located in the plane where 
the plenums enter the common duct section for the purpose of equalizing 
the static pressures in each plenum. The length of the plenum is a 
minimum of 2.5x(AxB)<SUP>.5</SUP>, A=width and B=height of duct or 
outlet. Static pressure readings are taken at a distance of 
2x(AxB)<SUP>.5</SUP> from the outlet.
    3.2  Testing conditions for air source heating only units. The 
equipment under test shall be installed according to the requirements of 
Section 11.2 of ASHRAE Standard 37-78 and Section 5.1.4.5 of ARI 
Standard 240-77. Test chamber requirements are the same as given in 
Section 11.1 of ASHRAE Standard 37-78. Units designed for both 
horizontal and vertical installation shall be tested in the orientation 
in which they are most often installed. All tests shall be performed at 
the normal residential voltage and frequency for which the equipment is 
designed (either 115 or 230 volts and 60 hertz). Values of capacity for 
rating purposes are to be rounded off to the nearest 100 Btu/hour for 
capacities less than 20,000 Btu/hour; to the nearest 200 Btu/hour for 
capacities between 20,000 and 37,999 Btu/hour; and to the nearest 500 
Btu/hour for capacities between 38,000 and 64,999 Btu/hour.
    3.2.1  Testing conditions for units with single speed compressors.
    3.2.1.1  High temperature test conditions. The High Temperature Test 
at 47  deg. F shall be conducted at an outdoor dry-bulb temperature of 
47  deg. F and an outdoor wet-bulb temperature at 43  deg. F. The High 
Temperature Test at 62  deg. F shall be conducted at an outdoor dry-bulb 
temperature of 62  deg. F and an outdoor wet-bulb temperature of 56.5 
deg. F. For both tests, the dry-bulb air temperature entering and 
surrounding the indoor portion of the unit shall be 70  deg. F and a 
maximum wet-bulb temperature of 60  deg. F. The duration of the tests 
shall be for a minimum of \1/2\ hour.
    3.2.1.2  Cycling test conditions. The Cycling Test at 47  deg.F 
shall be conducted at the same dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperature as the 
High Temperature Test at 47  deg.F as described in 3.2.1.1. During the 
Cycling Test, the indoor fan shall cycle ``on'' and ``off'', as the 
compressor cycles ``on'' and ``off'', except that the indoor fan cycling 
times may be delayed due to controls that are normally installed with 
the unit. The compressor cycling times shall be 6 minutes ``On'' and 24 
minutes ``off.'' The test installation shall be designed such that there 
will be no airflow through the indoor unit due to natural or forced 
convection while the indoor fan is ``off.'' This shall be accomplished 
by installing dampers upstream and downstream of the test unit to block 
the off period airflow.
    3.2.1.3  Frost accumulation test conditions. The dry-bulb 
temperature and the resultant dew-point temperature of the air entering 
the outdoor portion of the unit shall be 35  deg.F and 30  deg.F 
respectively. The indoor dry-bulb temperature shall be 70  deg.F and the 
maximum indoor wet-bulb temperature shall be 60  deg.F. The Frost 
Accumulation Test requires that the unit undergo a defrost prior to the 
actual test. The test then begins at defrost termination and ends at the 
next defrost termination. Defrost termination occurs when the controls 
normally installed within the unit are actuated to cause it to change 
defrost operation to normal heating operation. During the test, 
auxiliary resistance heaters shall not be employed during either the 
heating or defrost portion of the test.
    3.2.1.4  Low temperature test conditions. The Low Temperature Test 
shall be conducted at a dry-bulb temperature entering the outdoor 
portion of the unit of 17  deg.F and a wet-bulb temperature of 15 
deg.F. The air entering the indoor portion of the unit shall have a dry-
bulb temperature of 70  deg.F and a maximum wet-bulb temperature of 60 
deg.F.
    3.2.1.5  Additional testing conditions. All tests shall be conducted 
at the indoor-side air quantities specified in Sections 4.1.4.3 and 
5.1.4.6 and Table 2 of ARI Standard 240-77. The following conditions 
listed in ARI

[[Page 210]]

Standard 240-77 shall apply to all tests performed in Section 3.2 of 
this Appendix.

    3.2.3  Testing conditions for units with triple-capacity 
compressors. (Reserved)
    3.2.4  Testing conditions for units with variable-speed compressors. 
The testing condition for variable-speed compressors shall be the same 
as those for single speed units as described in section 3.2.1 of this 
Appendix with the following exceptions; the cyclic test is performed 
with an outdoor dry bulb temperature of 62  deg.F and a wet bulb 
temperature of 56.5  deg.F. The optional, nominal capacity test shall be 
performed at the conditions specified for the 47  deg.F high temperature 
test.
    3.2.5  Testing conditions for split-type ductless system. The 
testing conditions for split-type ductless systems shall be based on the 
type of compressor installed in the single outdoor unit. The heating 
mode shall have the same piping and control requirements as in 3.1.7.
5.4.4.4  Outdoor-Side Air Quantity; and
5.1.4.5  Requirements for Separated Assemblies.

In all tests, the specified dry-bulb temperature entering the outdoor 
portion of the unit also applies to the air temperature surrounding the 
outdoor portion of the unit. Similarly, models where portions are 
intended to be installed indoors shall have the air temperature 
surrounding that portion of the unit the same as the indoor air 
temperature.
    3.2.2  Testing conditions for units with two-speed compressors, two 
compressors or cylinder unloading. The testing conditions for two-speed 
compressors, two compressors, or cylinder unloading shall be the same as 
those for single speed units as described in 3.2.1.
    3.3  Testing conditions for air source units which provide both 
heating and cooling. The testing conditions for units which provide both 
heating and cooling shall be the same as the requirements in Sections 
3.1 and 3.2 of this Appendix.
    4.0  Testing procedures. Measure all electrical inputs as described 
in the procedures below. All electrical measurements during all ``on'' 
and ``off'' periods shall include auxiliary power or energy (controls, 
transformers, crankcase heaters, etc.) delivered to the unit.
    4.1  Test procedures for air source cooling-only units. All steady-
state wet- and dry-coil performance tests on single package units shall 
simultaneously employ the Air-Enthalpy Method (Section 3 of ASHRAE 
Standard 37-78) on the indoor side and one other method consisting of 
either the Air-Enthalpy Method or the Compressor Calibration Method 
(Section 4 of ASHRAE Standard 37-78 on the outdoor side. All steady-
state wet- and dry-coil performance tests on split systems shall 
simultaneously employ the Air-Enthalpy Method or the Compressor 
Calibration Method on the indoor side and the Air-Enthalpy Method, the 
Compressor Calibration Method or the Volatile Refrigerant Flow Method 
(Section 5 of ASHRAE Standard 37-78) on the outside. All cyclic dry-coil 
performance tests shall employ the Air-Enthalpy Method, indoor side 
only. The values calculated from the two test methods must agree within 
6 percent in order to constitute a valid test. Only the results from the 
Air-Enthalpy Method on the indoor side shall be used in the calculations 
in Section 5.1. Units shall be installed and tested in such a manner 
that when operated under steady-state conditions, the cooling coil and 
condenser coil air flows meet the requirements of Sections 5.1.3.4, 
5.1.3.5, and 5.1.3.7 of ARI Standard 210.79.
    4.1.1  Test operating procedures.
    4.1.1.1  Steady-state wet-coil performance tests (Test A and Test 
B). Steady-state wet-coil performance tests (A and B) shall be conducted 
in accordance with the conditions described in sections 3.1.1.1, 3.1.2, 
3.1.3, 3.1.4, and 3.1.5 of this Appendix and the procedures described 
for cooling tests in Section 11.3 of ASHRAE standard 37-78 and evaluated 
in accordance with the cooling-related requirements of Section 12 of the 
ASHRAE Standard 37-78. The test room reconditioning apparatus and the 
equipment under test shall be operated until equilibrium conditions are 
attained.
    4.1.1.2  Steady-state and cyclic dry-coil performance tests (Test C 
and Test D). The steady-state and cyclic dry-coil tests (C and D) shall 
be conducted as described below in accordance with the conditions 
described in sections 3.1.1.2, 3.1.2, 3.1.3, 3.1.4, and 3.1.5 of this 
Appendix. The results shall be evaluated in accordance with the cooling 
related requirements of Sections 12.1.5, 12.1.6, 12.1.7, of ASHRAE 
Standard 37.78. The test room reconditioning apparatus and the equipment 
under test shall be operated until equilibrium conditions are attained, 
but not for less than one hour before data for test C are recorded. For 
all equipment test methods including the Compressor Calibration Method, 
test C shall be performed with data recorded at 10-minute intervals 
until four consecutive sets of readings are attained with the tolerance 
prescribed in Section 11.6 of ASHRAE Standard 37-78. When the Air-
Enthalpy Method is used on the outdoor side for test C, the requirements 
of this section shall apply to both the preliminary test and the regular 
equipment test; the requirements of Section 3.6 of ASHRAE Standard 37-78 
shall also apply. Immediately after test C is completed the test unit 
shall be manually cycled ``off'' and ``on'' using the time periods from 
3.1.1 of this Appendix until steadily repeating ambient conditions are 
again achieved in both the indoor and outdoor test chambers, but for not 
less than 2 complete ``off''/``on'' cycles. Without a break in the 
cycling pattern, the

[[Page 211]]

unit shall be run through an additional ``off''/``on'' cycle during 
which the test data required in 5.1 shall be recorded. During this last 
cycle, which is referred to as the test cycle, the indoor and outdoor 
test room ambient conditions shall remain within the tolerances 
specified in 4.1.3 of this Appendix during the cyclic dry-coil tests, 
all air moving equipment on the condenser side shall cycle ``on'' and 
``off'' when the compressor cycles ``on'' and ``off''. The indoor air 
moving equipment shall also cycle ``off'' as governed by any automatic 
controls normally installed with the unit. This last requirement applies 
to units having an indoor fan time delay. Units not supplied with an 
indoor fan time delay shall have the indoor air moving equipment cycle 
``on'' and ``off'' as the compressor cycles ``on'' and ``off.''
    Cooling cyclic tests for variable-speed units shall be conducted by 
cycling the compressor 12 minutes ``on'' and 48 minutes ``off''. The 
capacity shall be measured for the integration time ([thetas]), which is 
the compressor ``on'' time of 12 minutes or the ``on'' time as extended 
by fan delay, if so equipped. The electrical energy shall be measured 
for the total integration time ([thetas]<INF>cyc</INF>) of 60 minutes. 
In lieu of conducting C and D tests, an assigned value of 0.25 shall be 
used for the degradation coefficient for cooling, C<INF>D</INF>.
    4.1.1.3  Testing procedures for triple-capacity compressors. 
(Reserved)
    4.1.1.4  Intermediate cooling steady-state test for units with 
variable-speed compressors. For units with variable-speed compressors, 
an intermediate cooling steady-state test shall be conducted in which 
the unit shall be operated at a constant, intermediate compressor speed 
(k=i) in which the dry/bulb and wet-bulb temperatures of the air 
entering the indoor coil are 80  deg.F<INF>DB</INF> and 67 
deg.F<INF>WB</INF> and the outdoor coil are 87  deg.<INF>DB</INF> and 69 
 deg.F<INF>WB</INF>. The tolerances for the dry-bulb and wet-bulb 
temperatures of the air entering the indoor and outdoor coils shall be 
the test operating tolerance and test condition tolerance specified in 
Table 6.1.1 of this Appendix. The intermediate compressor speed shall be 
the minimum compressor speed plus one-third the difference between the 
maximum and minimum speeds of the cooling mode. (Inter. speed=min. 
speed+\1/3\ (max. speed-min. speed.) A tolerance of plus five percent or 
the next higher inverter frequency step from that calculated is allowed.
    4.1.1.5  Testing procedures for split-type ductless systems. Cyclic 
tests of ductless units will be conducted without dampers. The data 
cycle shall be preceded by a minimum of two cycles in which the indoor 
fan cycles on and off with the compressor. For the data cycle the indoor 
fan will operate three minutes prior to compressor cut-on and remain on 
for three minutes after compressor cut-off. The integration time for 
capacity and power shall be from compressor cut-on time to indoor fan 
cut-off time. The fan power for three minutes after compressor cut-off 
shall be added to the integrated cooling capacity.
    4.1.2  Test instrumentation. The steady-state and cyclic performance 
tests shall have the same requirements pertaining to instrumentation and 
data as those specified in Section 10 and Table II of ASHRAE Standard 
37.78. For the cyclic dry-coil performance tests, the dry-bulb 
temperature of the air entering and leaving the cooling coil, or the 
difference between these two dry-bulb temperatures, shall be 
continuously recorded with instrumentation accurate to within 
<plus-minus>0.3  deg.F of indicated value and have a response time of 
2.5 seconds or less. Response time in the time required for the 
instrumentation to obtain 63 percent of the final steady-state 
temperature difference when subjected to a step change in temperature 
difference of 15  deg.F or more. Electrical measurement devices (watt-
hour meters) used during all tests shall be accurate to within 
<plus-minus>0.5 percent of indicated value.
    4.1.3  Test tolerances. All steady-state wet-and dry-coil 
performance tests shall be performed within the applicable operating and 
test condition tolerances specified in Section 11.6 and Table III of 
ASHRAE Standard 37-78.
    4.1.3.1  The indoor and outdoor average dry-bulb temperature for the 
cyclic dry coil test D shall both be within 1.0  deg.F of the indoor and 
outdoor average dry bulb temperature for the steady-state dry coil test 
C, respectively.
    4.1.3.2  The test condition and test operating tolerances for 
conducting test D are stated in 6.1.1 of this Appendix. Variation in the 
test conditions greater than the tolerances prescribed in 6.1.1 of this 
Appendix shall invalidate the test. It is suggested that an electric 
resistance heater having a heating capacity approximately equal to the 
sum of the cooling capacity and compressor and condenser fan power 
should be installed in the outdoor test room and cycled ``off'' and 
``on'' as the unit cycles ``on'' and ``off'' respectively to improve 
control in the outdoor test room. Similarly, an electric resistance 
heater having a heating capacity approximately equal to the cooling 
capacity of the unit could be installed in the indoor test room, and 
cycled ``on'' and ``off'' as the test unit cycles ``on'' and ``off'' to 
improve indoor room control.
    4.2  Testing procedures for air source heating only units.
    4.2.1  Test operating procedures. All High Temperature Tests, the 
Cyclic Test, the Frost Accumulation Test, and the low Temperature test 
shall have the performance evaluated by the Air-Enthalpy Method on the 
indoor side. In addition, the High Temperature Test and the Low 
Temperature Test shall have a simultaneous test method (as described in 
4.1) used as a check. The values calculated from the two methods must 
agree

[[Page 212]]

within 6 percent in order to constitute a valid test. Only the results 
from the Air-Enthalpy Method on the indoor side shall be used in the 
calulations in section 5.2.
    4.2.1.1  Test procedure for high temperature test. When the outdoor 
Air-Enthalpy Method is used, the outdoor chamber must not interfere with 
the normal air circulating pattern during the preliminary test. It is 
necessary to determine and adjust for system resistance when the outdoor 
air measuring apparatus is attached to the outdoor portion of the unit. 
The test room apparatus and test units must be operated for at least one 
hour with at least \1/2\ hour at equilibrium and at the specified test 
conditions prior to starting the test. The High Temperature Test shall 
then be conducted for a minimum of \1/2\ hour with intermittent data 
being recorded at 10-minute intervals. For all units, especially those 
having controls which periodically cause the unit to operate in defrost 
mode, attention should be given to prevent defrost during the High 
Temperature Test. Units which have undergone a defrost should operate in 
the heating mode for at least 10-minutes after defrost termination prior 
to the start of the test. When the outdoor Air-Enthalpy Method is used 
as a second test then a preliminary test must be conducted for a minimum 
of 30 minutes with 4 or more sets of data recorded at 10 minute 
intervals, all remaining requirements of Section 3.6.1 in the ASHRAE 
Standard 37-78 shall then apply in conducting the preliminary test for 
the outdoor air enthalpy method. For some units, at the ambient 
condition of the test, frost may accumulate on the outdoor coil. If the 
supply air temperature or the difference between the supply air 
temperature and the indoor air entering temperature has decreased by 
more than 1.5  deg.F at the end of the test, the unit shall be defrosted 
and the test restarted. Only the results of this second High Temperature 
Test shall be used in the heating seasonal performance calculation in 
section 5.2. Prior to beginning the High Temperature Test, a unit shall 
operate in the heating mode for at least 10 minutes after defrost 
termination to establish equilibrium conditions for the unit and the 
room reconditioning apparatus. The High Temperature Test may only begin 
when the test unit and room conditions are within the test condition 
tolerances specified in Section 6.2.1 of this Appendix.
    4.2.1.2  Test procedures for the cyclic test. The cyclic test shall 
follow the High Temperature Test and by cycled ``on'' and ``off'' as 
specified in 3.2.1.2 until steadily repeating ambient conditions are 
achieved for both the indoor and outdoor test chambers, but for not less 
than 2 complete ``off''/``on'' cycles. Without a break in the cycling 
pattern, the unit shall be operated through an additional ``off''/``on'' 
cycle, during which the required test data shall be recorded. During the 
last cycle, which is referred to as the test cycle, the indoor and 
outdoor test room ambient conditions shall remain within the tolerance 
specified in section 6.2.2. of this Appendix. If, prior to the High 
Temperature Test, the unit underwent a defrost cycle to rid the outdoor 
coil of any accumulated frost, then prior to cycling the unit ``off'' 
and ``on'' it should be made to undergo a defrost. After defrost is 
completed and before starting the cycling process, the unit shall be 
operated continuously in the heating mode for a least 10 minutes to 
assure that equilibrium conditions have again been established for the 
unit and the room conditioning apparatus. Cycling the unit may begin 
when the test unit and room conditions are within the High Temperature 
Test condition tolerances specified in section 6.2.1 of this Appendix. 
Attention should be given to prevent defrost after the cycling process 
has begun.
    The cycle times for variable-speed units is the same as the cyclic 
time in the cooling mode as specified in section 4.1.1.2 of this 
Appendix. Cyclic tests of split-type ductless units will be conducted 
without dampers, and the data cycle shall be preceded by a minimum of 
two cycles in which the indoor fan cycles on and off with the 
compressor. During the data cycle for the split type ductless units, the 
indoor fan will operate three minutes prior to compressor ``cut-on'' and 
remain on for three minutes after compressor ``cut-off''. The 
integration time for capacity and power will be from compressor ``cut-
on'' time to indoor fan ``cut-off'' time. The fan power for the three 
minutes after compressor ``cut-off'' shall be subtracted from the 
integrated heating capacity. For split-type ductless systems which turn 
the indoor fan off during defrost, the indoor supply duct shall not be 
blocked.
    4.2.1.3  Test procedures for the frost accumulation test. The 
defrost controls shall be set at the normal settings which most typify 
those encountered in Region IV as described in section 6.2.4 and 6.2.5 
of this Appendix. The test room reconditioning equipment and the unit 
under test shall be operated for at least \1/2\ hour prior to the start 
of a ``preliminary'' test period. The preliminary test period and the 
test period itself are to be conducted within the test tolerances given 
in section 4.2.3.3 of this Appendix. In some cases, the preliminary 
defrost cycle may be manually induced, however, it is important that the 
normally operating controls govern the defrost termination in all cases. 
For units containing defrost controls which are likely to cause defrost 
at intervals less than one hour when the unit is operating at the 
required test conditions, the preliminary test period shall start at the 
termination of a defrost cycle which automatically occurs and shall end 
at the termination of the next automatically occurring defrost cycle. 
For units containing defrost controls which are

[[Page 213]]

likely to cause defrost at intervals exceeding one hour when operating 
at the required test condition, the preliminary test period consists of 
``heating-only'' preliminary operation for at least one hour, after 
which a defrost may be manually or automatically induced. The test 
period then begins at the termination of this defrost cycle and ends at 
the termination of the next automatically occurring defrost cycle. If 
the unit has not undergone a defrost after 12 hours, then the tests 
shall be concluded and the results calculated for this 12-hour period. 
For units which turn the indoor fan off during defrost the indoor supply 
duct shall be blocked during all defrost cycles to prevent natural or 
forced convection through the indoor unit. During defrost, resistance 
heaters normally installed with the unit shall be prevented from 
operating.
    For units with variable-speed compressors, the frost accumulation 
test at the intermediate speed shall be conducted such that the unit 
will operate at a constant, intermediate compressor speed (k=i) as 
determined in section 4.1.1.4 of this Appendix. The following two 
equations may be used in lieu of the frost accumulation test for 
variable-speed.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.039

    4.2.1.4  Test procedures for the low temperature test. Where 
applicable, the High Temperature Test preparation and performance 
requirements shall also be used in the Low Temperature Test. The test 
room reconditioning equipment shall first be operated in a steady-state 
manner for at least one-half hour at equilibrium and at the specified 
test conditions. The unit shall then undergo a defrost, either automatic 
or manually induced. It is important that the unit terminate the defrost 
sequence by the action of its own defrost controls. The defrost controls 
are to remain at the same setting as specified in 4.2.1.3. At a time no 
earlier than 10 minutes after defrost termination, the test shall start. 
Test duration is one-half hour. For all units, defrost should be 
prevented during the one-half hour test period.
    4.2.2  Test instrumentation.
    4.2.2.1  Test instrumentation for the high temperature test. The 
indoor air flow rate shall be determined as described in Section 7.1 
through 7.4 of ASHRAE Standard 37-78. This requires the construction of 
an air receiving chamber and discharge chamber separated by partition in 
which one or more nozzles are located. The receiving chamber is 
connected to the indoor air discharge side of the test specimen through 
a short plenum. The exhaust side of the air flow rate measuring device 
contains an exhaust fan with some means to vary its capacity to obtain 
the desired external resistance to air flow rate. The exhaust side is 
then left open to the test room or is ducted through a conditioning 
apparatus and then back to the test specimen inlet. The static pressure 
across the nozzles, the velocity pressure, and the static pressure 
measurements at the nozzle throat shall be measured with manometers 
which will result in errors which are no greater than <plus-minus>1.0 
percent of indicated value and having minimum scale divisions not 
exceeding 2.0 percent of the reading. Static pressure and temperature 
measurements must be taken at the nozzle throat in order to obtain 
density of the air. The areas of the nozzles shall be determined by 
measuring their diameter with an error no greater than <plus-minus>0.2 
percent in four places approximately 45 degrees apart around the nozzle 
in each of two places through the nozzle throat, one at the outlets and 
the others in the straight section near the radius. The energy usage of 
the compressor, indoor and outdoor fan, and all other equipment 
components shall be measured with a watt-hour meter which is accurate to 
within <plus-minus>0.5 percent of the quantity measured. Measurements of 
the air temperature entering and leaving the indoor coil or the 
difference between these two shall be made in accordance with the 
requirements of ASHRAE Standard 41 part 1. These temperatures shall be 
continuously recorded with instrumentation having a total system 
accuracy within <plus-minus>0.3  deg.F of indicated value and a response 
time of 2.5 seconds or less. Temperature measurements are to be made 
upstream of the static pressure tap on the inlet and downstream of the 
static pressure taps on the outlet. The indoor and outdoor dry-bulb 
temperatures shall be continuously recorded with instrumentation which 
will result in an error no greater than <plus-minus>0.3  deg.F of 
indicated value. The outdoor wet-bulb temperature shall be continuously 
recorded. Static pressure measurements in the ducts and across the unit 
shall

[[Page 214]]

be made in accordance with Section 8 of ASHRAE Standard 37-78 using 
equipment which will result in an error no greater than <plus-minus>0.01 
inch of water. Static pressure measurements shall be made and recorded 
at 5 minute intervals. All other data not continuously recorded shall be 
recorded at 10 minute intervals.
    4.2.2.2  Test instrumentation for the cycling test. The air flow 
rate during the on-period of the Cyclic Test shall be the same agreed 
within <plus-minus>1. percent as the air flow rate measured during the 
previously conducted High Temperature Test. All other instrumentation 
requirements are identical to 4.2.2.1 of this Appendix.
    4.2.2.3  Test instrumentation for the frost accumulation test. The 
air flow rate for the Frost Accumulation Test shall be the same as 
described in 4.2.2.1. The indoor-side dry-bulb temperature and outdoor-
side dry-bulb temperature shall be continuously recorded with 
instrumentation having a total system accuracy within <plus-minus>0.3 
deg.F of indicated value. The outdoor dew point temperature shall be 
determined with an error no greater than <plus-minus>0.5  deg.F of 
indicated value using continuously recording instrumentation. All other 
data shall be recorded at 10 minute intervals during the heating cycle. 
Defrost initiation, termination and complete test cycle time (from 
defrost termination to defrost termination) shall be recorded. Defrost 
initiation is defined as the actuation (either automatically or 
manually) of the controls normally installed with the unit which cause 
it to alter its normal heating operation in order to eliminate possible 
accumulations of frost on the outdoor coil. Defrost termination occurs 
when the controls normally within the unit are actuated to change from 
defrost operation to normal heating operation. Provisions should be made 
so that instrumentation in capable of recording the cooling done during 
defrost as well as the total electrical energy usage during defrost. 
These data and the continuously recorded data need be the only data 
obtained during defrost.
    4.2.2.4  Test instrumentation for the low temperature test. 
Instrumentation for the Low Temperature Test is identical to that of the 
High Temperature Test described in section 4.2.2.1 of this Appendix.
    4.2.3  Test tolerances.
    4.2.3.1  Test tolerances for the high temperature test. All tests 
shall be conducted within the tolerances specified in Section 6.2.1. 
Variation greater than those given shall invalidate the test. The 
heating capacity results by the indoor Air Enthalpy Method shall agree 
within 6 percent of the value determined by any other simultaneously 
conducted capacity test in order for the test to be valid.
    4.2.3.2  Test tolerances for the cyclic test. The test condition 
tolerances and test operating tolerances for the on-period portion of 
the test cycle are specified in Section 6.2.2. Variation exceeding any 
specified test tolerance shall invalidate the test results.
    4.2.3.3  Test tolerances for the frost accumulation test. Test 
condition and test operating tolerances for Frost Accumulation Tests are 
specified in Section 6.2.3. Test operating tolerances during heating 
applies when the unit is in the heating mode, except for the first 5 
minutes after the termination of a defrost cycle. Test operating 
tolerance during defrost applies during a defrost cycle and during the 
first 5 minutes after defrost termination when the unit is operating in 
the heating mode. In determining whether the test condition tolerances 
are met, only the heating portion of the test period shall be used in 
calculating the average values. Variations exceeding the tolerances 
presented in Section 6.2.3 shall invalidate the test.
    4.2.3.4  Test tolerances for the low temperature test. During the 
test period for the Low Temperature Test, the operating conditions shall 
be within the tolerances specified in Section 6.2.1 of this Appendix.
    4.3  Testing procedures for air source units which provide both 
heating and cooling. The testing procedures for units which provide both 
heating and cooling shall be the same as those specified in Sections 4.1 
and 4.2 of this Appendix. Also during the off-period of the dry-coil 
cooling test (test D), the switch-over valve shall remain in the cooling 
mode, unless the controls normally supplied with the unit are designed 
to reverse it, in which case the controls shall operate the valve. 
During the off-period of the cyclic heating test at 47  deg. F, the 
switch-over valve shall remain in the heating mode, unless the controls

case the controls shall operate the valve.
    5.0  Calculations for performance factors.
    5.1  Calculations of seasonal energy efficiency ratios (SEER) in 
air-source units.
    The testing data and results required to calculate the seasonal 
energy efficiency ratio (SEER) in Btu's per watt-hour shall include the 
following:
    (i) Cooling capacities (Btu/hr) from tests A and B and, if 
applicable, the cooling capacity (Btu/hr) from test C and the total 
cooling done from test D (Btu's).
Q<INF>ss</INF> k (95F)
Q<INF>ss</INF> k (82F)
Q<INF>ss</INF>, dry
Q<INF>cyc</INF>, dry
    (ii) Electrical power input to all components and controls (watts) 
from tests A, B, and if applicable the electrical power input to all 
components and controls (watts) from test C and the electrical usage 
(watt-hour) from test D.

    Where the cooling capacities Q<INF>ss</INF> k (95F), from test A, 
Q<INF>ss</INF> k (82), from test B, and Q<INF>ss</INF>, dry, from test 
C, are calculated using the equations specified in section 3.7 of ASHRAE 
Standard 37-78. The total cooling done, Q<INF>cyc</INF>, dry from test 
D, is calculated using equation (1) below.
    Units which do not have indoor air circulating fans furnished as 
part of the model shall have their measured total cooling capacities 
adjusted by subtracting 1250 Btu/hr per 1,000 CFM of measured indoor air 
flow and adding to the total steady-state electrical power input 365 
watts per 1,000 CFM of measured indoor air flow.
    Energy efficiency ratios from tests A, B, and C, EER<INF>A</INF>, 
EER<INF>B</INF>, EER<INF>ss</INF>, dry respectively, are each calculated 
as the ratio of the total cooling capacity in Btu/hr to the total 
electrical power input in watts.
    Units which do not have indoor air circulating fans furnished as 
part of the model shall adjust their total cooling done and energy used 
in one complete cycle for the effect of circulating indoor air equipment 
power. The value to be used for the circulating indoor air equipment 
power shall be 1250 Btu/hr per 1,000 CFM of circulating indoor air. The 
energy usage required in one complete cycle required for indoor air 
circulation is the product of the circulating indoor air equipment power 
and the duration of time in one cycle that the circulating indoor air 
equipment is on. The total cooling done shall then be the measured 
cooling in one complete cycle minus the energy usage required for indoor 
air circulation in one complete cycle. The total electrical energy usage 
shall be the sum of the energy usage required for indoor air circulation 
in one complete cycle and the energy used by the remaining equipment 
components (compressor(s), outdoor fan, crankcase heater, 
transformer(s), etc.) in one complete test cycle.
    Energy efficiency ratio from tests D, EER<INF>cyc</INF> dry is 
calculated as the ratio of the total cooling done in Btu's to the total 
electrical energy usage in watt-hours.

 Appendix N to Subpart B of Part 430--Uniform Test Method for Measuring 
             the Energy Consumption of Furnaces and Boilers

    1.0  Scope. The scope of this appendix is as specified in section 
2.0 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993.
    2.0  Definitions. Definitions include the definitions specified in 
section 3 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993 and the following additional 
and modified definitions:
    2.1  ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993 means the test standard published 
in 1993 by ASHRAE, approved by the American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI) on October 4, 1993, and entitled ``Method of Testing for Annual 
Fuel Utilization Efficiency of Residential Central Furnaces and 
Boilers'' (with errata of October 24, 1996).
    2.2  ASHRAE means the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and 
Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc.
    2.3  Thermal stack damper means a type of stack damper which is 
dependent for operation exclusively upon the direct conversion of 
thermal energy of the stack gases to open the damper.
    2.4  Isolated combustion system. The definition of isolation 
combustion system in section 3 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993 is 
incorporated with the addition of the following: ``The unit is installed 
in an un-conditioned indoor space isolated from the heated space.''
    3.0  Classifications. Classifications are as specified in section 4 
of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993.
    4.0  Requirements. Requirements are as specified in section 5 of 
ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993.
    5.0  Instruments. Instruments must be as specified in section 6 of 
ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993.
    6.0  Apparatus. The apparatus used in conjunction with the furnace 
or boiler during the testing shall be as specified in section 7 of ANSI/
ASHRAE Standard 103-1993 except for the second paragraph of section 
7.2.2.2 and except for section 7.2.2.5, and as specified in section 6.1 
of this appendix.
    6.1  Downflow furnaces. Install the internal section of vent pipe 
the same size as the flue collar for connecting the flue collar to the 
top of the unit, if not supplied by the manufacturer. Do not insulate 
the internal vent pipe during the jacket loss test (if conducted) 
described in section 8.6 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993 or the steady-
state test described in section 9.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993. Do 
not insulate the internal vent pipe before the cool-down and heat-up 
tests described in sections 9.5 and 9.6, respectively, of ANSI/ASHRAE 
Standard 103-1993. If the vent pipe is surrounded by a metal jacket, do 
not insulate the metal jacket. Install a 5-ft test stack of the same 
cross sectional area or perimeter as the vent pipe above the top of the 
furnace. Tape or seal around the junction connecting the vent pipe and 
the 5-ft test stack. Insulate the 5-ft test stack with insulation having 
an R-value not less than 7 and an outer layer of aluminum foil. (See 
Figure 3-E of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993.)
    7.0  Testing conditions. The testing conditions shall be as 
specified in section 8 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993 with errata of 
October 24, 1996, except for section 8.6.1.1; and as specified in 
section 7.1 of this appendix.
    7.1  Measurement of jacket surface temperature. The jacket of the 
furnace or boiler shall be subdivided into 6-inch squares when 
practical, and otherwise into 36-square-inch regions comprising 4 in. x 
9 in. or 3 in. x 12 in. sections, and the surface temperature at the 
center of each square or section shall be determined with a surface 
thermocouple. The 36-square-inch areas shall be recorded in groups where 
the temperature differential of the 36-square-inch area is less than 10 
deg.F for temperature up to 100  deg.F above room temperature and less 
than 20  deg.F for temperature more than 100  deg.F above room 
temperature. For forced air central furnaces, the circulating air blower 
compartment is considered as part of the duct system and no surface 
temperature measurement of the blower compartment needs to be recorded 
for the purpose of this test. For downflow furnaces, measure all cabinet 
surface temperatures of the heat exchanger and combustion section, 
including the bottom around the outlet duct, and the burner door, using 
the 36 square-inch thermocouple grid. The cabinet surface temperatures 
around the blower section do not need to be measured (See figure 3-E of 
ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993.)
    8.0  Test procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified 
in section 9 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993 except for sections 
9.5.1.1, 9.5.1.2.1, 9.5.1.2.2, 9.5.2.1, and section 9.7.1. ; and as 
specified in sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5, of this appendix.
    8.1  Input to interrupted ignition device. For burners equipped with 
an interrupted ignition device, record the nameplate electric power used 
by the ignition device, PE<INF>IG</INF>, or use PE<INF>IG</INF>=0.4 kW 
if no nameplate power input

[[Page 235]]

is provided. Record the nameplate ignition device on-time interval, 
t<INF>IG</INF>, or measure the on-time period at the beginning of the 
test at the time the burner is turned on with a stop watch, if no 
nameplate value is given. Set t<INF>IG</INF>=0 and PE<INF>IG</INF>=0 if 
the device on-time is less than or equal to 5 seconds after the burner 
is on.
    8.2  Gas- and oil-fueled gravity and forced air central furnaces 
without stack dampers cool-down test. Turn off the main burner after 
steady-state testing is completed, and measure the flue gas temperature 
by means of the thermocouple grid described in section 7.6 of ANSI/
ASHRAE 103-1993 at 1.5 minutes (T<INF>F,OFF</INF>(t<INF>3</INF>)) and 9 
minutes (T<INF>F,OFF</INF>(t<INF>4</INF>)) after the burner shuts off. 
An integral draft diverter shall remain blocked and insulated, and the 
stack restriction shall remain in place. On atmospheric systems with an 
integral draft diverter or draft hood, equipped with either an 
electromechanical inlet damper or an electro-mechanical flue damper that 
closes within 10 seconds after the burner shuts off to restrict the flow 
through the heat exchanger in the off-cycle, bypass or adjust the 
control for the electromechanical damper so that the damper remains open 
during the cool-down test. For furnaces that employ post purge, measure 
the length of the post-purge period with a stopwatch. The time from 
burner OFF to combustion blower OFF (electrically de-energized) shall be 
recorded as t<INF>p</INF>. For the case where t<INF>p</INF> is intended 
to be greater than 180 seconds, stop the combustion blower at 180 
seconds and use that value for t<INF>p</INF>. Measure the flue gas 
temperature by means of the thermocouple grid described in section 7.6 
of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-1993 at the end of post-purge period, t<INF>p</INF> 
(T<INF>F,OFF</INF>(t<INF>p</INF>)), and at the time (1.5 + 
t<INF>p</INF>) minutes (T<INF>F,OFF</INF>(t<INF>3</INF>)) and (9.0 + 
t<INF>p</INF>) minutes (T<INF>F,OFF</INF>(t<INF>4</INF>)) after the main 
burner shuts off. For the case where the measured tp is less than or 
equal to 30 seconds, it shall be tested as if there is no post purge and 
t<INF>p</INF> shall be set equal to 0.
    8.3  Gas- and oil-fueled gravity and forced air central furnaces 
without stack dampers with adjustable fan control--cool-down test. For a 
furnace with adjustable fan control, this time delay will be 3.0 minutes 
for non-condensing furnaces or 1.5 minutes for condensing furnaces or 
until the supply air temperature drops to a value of 40  deg.F above the 
inlet air temperature, whichever results in the longest fan on-time. For 
a furnace without adjustable fan control or with the type of adjustable 
fan control whose range of adjustment does not allow for the delay time 
specified above, the control shall be bypassed and the fan manually 
controlled to give the delay times specified above. For a furnace which 
employs a single motor to drive the power burner and the indoor air 
circulating blower, the power burner and indoor air circulating blower 
shall be stopped together.
    8.4  Gas-and oil-fueled boilers without stack dampers cool-down 
test. After steady-state testing has been completed, turn the main 
burner(s) OFF and measure the flue gas temperature at 3.75 
(T<INF>F,OFF</INF>(t<INF>3</INF>)) and 22.5 
(T<INF>F,OFF</INF>(t<INF>4</INF>)) minutes after the burner shut off, 
using the thermocouple grid described in section 7.6 of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-
1993. During this off-period, for units that do not have pump delay 
after shutoff, no water shall be allowed to circulate through the hot 
water boilers. For units that have pump delay on shutoff, except those 
having pump controls sensing water temperature, the pump shall be 
stopped by the unit control and the time t<SUP>+</SUP>, between burner 
shutoff and pump shutoff shall be measured within one-second accuracy. 
For units having pump delay controls that sense water temperature, the 
pump shall be operated for 15 minutes and t<SUP>+</SUP> shall be 15 
minutes. While the pump is operating, the inlet water temperature and 
flow rate shall be maintained at the same values as used during the 
steady-state test as specified in sections 9.1 and 8.4.2.3 of ANSI/
ASHRAE 103-1993.
    For boilers that employ post purge, measure the length of the post-
purge period with a stopwatch. The time from burner OFF to combustion 
blower OFF (electrically de-energized) shall be recorded as 
t<INF>P</INF>. For the case where t<INF>P</INF> is intended to be 
greater than 180 seconds, stop the combustion blower at 180 seconds and 
use that value for t<INF>P</INF>. Measure the flue gas temperature by 
means of the thermocouple grid described in section 7.6 of ANSI/ASHRAE 
103-1993 at the end of the post purge period 
t<INF>P</INF>(T<INF>F,OFF</INF>(t<INF>P</INF>)) and at the time (3.75 + 
t<INF>P</INF>) minutes (T<INF>F,OFF</INF>(t<INF>3</INF>)) and (22.5 + 
t<INF>P</INF>) minutes (T<INF>F,OFF</INF>(t<INF>4</INF>)) after the main 
burner shuts off. For the case where the measured t<INF>P</INF> is less 
or equal to 30 seconds, it shall be tested as if there is no post purge 
and t<INF>P</INF> shall be set to equal 0.
    8.5  Direct measurement of off-cycle losses testing method.

mechanical device designed to maintain a constant draft in a vented 
heater.
    1.4  ``Draft hood'' means an external device which performs the same 
function as an integral draft diverter, as defined in section 1.17 of 
this appendix.
    1.5  ``Electro-mechanical stack damper'' means a type of stack 
damper which is operated by electrical and/or mechanical means.

vent terminal through which the flue gases pass prior to the point of 
draft relief.
    1.8  ``Flue damper'' means a device installed between the furnace 
and the integral draft diverter, draft hood, barometric draft regulator, 
or vent terminal which is not equipped with a draft control device, 
designed to open the venting system when the appliance is in operation 
and to close the venting system when the appliance is in a standby 
condition.

exhaust of the products of combustion in the event of no draft, back 
draft, or stoppage beyond the draft diverter, (2) prevent a back draft 
from entering the vented heater, and (3) neutralize the stack action of 
the chimney or gas vent upon the operation of the vented heater.

    1.24  ``Stack damper'' means a device installed downstream of the 
integral draft diverter, draft hood, or barometric draft regulator, 
designed to open the venting system when the appliance is in operation 
and to close off the venting system when the appliance is in the standby 
condition.
    1.25  ``Stack gases'' means the flue gases combined with dilution 
air that enters at the integral draft diverter, draft hood or barometric 
draft regulator.
    1.26  ``Steady-state conditions for vented home heating equipment'' 
means equilibrium conditions as indicated by temperature variations of 
not more than 5  deg.F (2.8C) in the flue gas temperature for units 
equipped with draft hoods, barometric draft regulators or direct vent 
systems, in three successive readings taken 15 minutes apart or not more 
than 3  deg.F (1.7C) in the stack gas temperature for units equipped 
with integral draft diverters in three successive readings taken 15 
minutes apart.
    1.27  ``Step-modulating control'' means a control that either cycles 
off and on at the low input if the heating load is light, or gradually, 
increases the heat input to meet any higher heating load that cannot be 
met with the low firing rate.
    1.28  ``Thermal stack damper'' means a type of stack damper which is 
dependent for operation exclusively upon the direct conversion of 
thermal energy of the stack gases into movement of the damper plate.
    1.29  ``Two stage control'' means a control that either cycles a 
burner at the reduced heat input rate and off or cycles a burner at the 
maximum heat input rate and off.
    1.30  ``Vaporizing-type oil burner'' means a device with an oil 
vaporizing bowl or other receptacle designed to operate by vaporizing 
liquid fuel oil by the heat of combustion and mixing the vaporized fuel

on the outside of a building and is connected to a vented heater by a 
system of conduits. It is composed of an air intake terminal through 
which the air for combustion is taken from the outside atmosphere and a 
vent terminal from which flue gases are discharged.
    1.32  ``Vent limiter'' means a device which limits the flow of air 
from the atmospheric diaphragm chamber of a gas pressure regulator to 
the atmosphere. A vent limiter may be a limiting orifice or other 
limiting device.
    1.33  ``Vent pipe'' means the passages and conduits in a direct vent 
system through which gases pass from the combustion chamber to the 
outdoor air.

1, fuel oil (kerosene) for vaporizing-type burners and either No. 1 or 
No. 2 fuel oil, as specified by the manufacturer, for mechanical 
atomizing type burners. Use No. 1 fuel oil with a viscosity meeting the 
specifications as specified in UL-730-1974, section 36.9. Use test fuel 
conforming to the specifications given in tables 2 and 3 of ANSI 
Standard Z91.1-1972

    2.4  Burner adjustments.
    2.4.1  Gas burner adjustments. Adjust the burners of gas fueled 
vented heaters to their maximum Btu ratings at the test pressure 
specified in section 2.3 of this appendix. Correct the burner volumetric 
flow rate to 60  deg.F (15.6C) and 30 inches of mercury barometric 
pressure, set the fuel flow rate to obtain a heat rate of within 
<plus-minus>2 percent of the hourly Btu rating specified by the 
manufacturer as measured after 15 minutes of operation starting with all 
parts of the vented heater at room temperature. Set the primary air 
shutters in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations to give a 
good flame at this adjustment. Do not allow the deposit of carbon during 
any test specified herein.
    If a vent limiting means is provided on a gas pressure regulator, 
have it in place during all tests.
    For gas fueled heaters with modulating controls adjust the controls 
to operate the heater at the maximum fuel input rate. Set the thermostat 
control to the maximum setting. Start the heater by turning the safety 
control valve to the ``on'' position. In order to prevent modulation of 
the burner at maximum input, place the thermostat sensing element in a 
temperature control bath which is held at a temperature below the 
maximum set point temperature of the control.
    For gas fueled heaters with modulating controls adjust the controls 
to operate the heater at the reduced fuel input rate. Set the thermostat 
control to the minimum setting. Start the heater by turning the safety 
control valve to the ``on'' position. If ambient test room temperature 
is above the lowest control set point temperature, initiate burner 
operation by placing the thermostat sensing element in a temperature 
control bath that is held at a temperature below the minimum set point 
temperature of the control.
    2.4.2  Oil burner adjustments. Adjust the burners of oil fueled 
vented heaters to give the CO<INF>2</INF> reading recommended by the 
manufacturer and an hourly Btu input, during the steady-state 
performance test described below, which is within <plus-minus>2 percent 
of the heater manufacturer's specified normal hourly Btu input rating. 
On units employing a power burner do not allow smoke in the flue to 
exceed a No. 1 smoke during the steady-state performance test as 
measured by the procedure in ANSI Standard Z11.182-1965 (R1971) (ASTM D 
2156-65 (1970)). If, on units employing a power burner, the smoke in the 
flue exceeds a No. 1 smoke during the steady-state test, readjust the 
burner to give a lower smoke reading, and, if necessary a lower 
CO<INF>2</INF> reading, and start all tests over. Maintain the average 
draft over the fire and in the flue during the steady-state performance 
test at that recommended by the manufacturer within <plus-minus>0.005 
inches of water gauge. Do not make additional adjustments to the burner 
during the required series of performance tests. The instruments and 
measuring apparatus for this test are described in section 6.3 of ANSI

    2.5.1  Forced air vented wall furnaces (including direct vent 
systems). During tests maintain the air flow through the heater as 
specified by the manufacturer and operate the vented heater with the 
outlet air temperature between 80  deg.F and 130  deg.F above room

the maximum possible air restriction.
    2.6  Location of temperature measuring instrumentation.
    2.6.1  Gas fueled vented home heating equipment (including direct 
vent systems). For units employing an integral draft diverter, install 
nine thermocouples, wired in parallel, in a horizontal plane in the five 
foot test stack located one foot from the test stack inlet. Equalize the 
length of all thermocouple leads before paralleling. Locate one 
thermocouple in the center of the stack. Locate eight thermocouples 
along imaginary lines intersecting at right angles in this horizontal 
plane at points one third and two thirds of the distance between the 
center of the stack and the stack wall.
    For units which employ a direct vent system, locate at least one 
thermocouple at the center of each flue way exiting the heat exchanger. 
Provide radiation shields if the thermocouples are exposed to burner 
radiation.
    For units which employ a draft hood or units which employ a direct 
vent system which does not significantly preheat the incoming combustion 
air, install nine thermocouples, wired in parallel, in a horizontal 
plane located within 12 inches (304.8 mm) of the heater outlet and 
upstream of the draft hood on units so equipped. Locate one thermocouple 
in the center of the pipe and eight thermocouples along imaginary lines 
intersecting at right angles in this horizontal plane at points one 
third and two thirds of the distance between the center of the pipe and 
the pipe wall.
    For units which employ direct vent systems that significantly 
preheat the incoming combustion air, install nine thermocouples, wired 
in parallel, in a plane parallel to and located within 6 inches (152.4 
mm) of the vent/air intake terminal. Equalize the length of all 
thermocouple leads before paralleling. Locate one thermocouple in the 
center of the vent pipe and eight thermocouples along imaginary lines 
intersecting at right angles in this plane at points one third and two 
thirds of the distance between the center of the flue pipe and the pipe 
wall.
    Use bead-type thermocouples having wire size not greater than No. 24 
American Wire Gauge (AWG). If there is a possibility that the 
thermocouples could receive direct radiation from the fire, install 
radiation shields on the fire side of the thermocouples only and 
position the shields so that they do not touch the thermocouple 
junctions.
    Install thermocouples for measuring conditioned warm air temperature 
as described in ANSI Z21.49-1975, section 2.14. Establish the 
temperature of the inlet air by means of single No. 24 AWG bead-type 
thermocouple, suitably shielded from direct radiation and located in the 
center of the plane of each inlet air opening.
    2.6.2  Oil fueled vented home heating equipment (including direct 
vent systems). Install nine thermocouples, wired in parallel and having 
equal length leads, in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the flue 
pipe. Locate this plane at the position shown in Figure 34.4 of UL 730-
1974, or Figures 35.1 and 35.2 of UL 729-1976 for a single thermocouple, 
except that on direct vent systems which significantly preheat the 
incoming combustion air, it shall be located within 6 inches (152.5 mm) 
of the outlet of the vent/air intake terminal. Locate one thermocouple 
in the center of the flue pipe and eight thermocouples along imaginary 
lines intersecting at right angles in this plane at points one third and 
two thirds of the distance between the center of the pipe and pipe wall.
    Use bead-type thermocouples having a wire size not greater than No. 
24 AWG. If there is a possibility that the thermocouples could receive 
direct radiation from the fire, install radiation shields on the fire 
side of the thermocouples only and position the shields so that they do 
not touch the thermocouple junctions.
    Install thermocouples for measuring the conditioned warm air 
temperature as described in sections 35.12 through 35.17 of UL 730-1974. 
Establish the temperature of the inlet air by means of a single No. 24 
AWG bead-type thermocouple, suitably shielded from direct radiation and 
located in the center of the plane of each inlet air opening.
    2.7  Combustion measurement instrumentation. Analyze the samples of 
stack and flue gases for vented heaters to determine the concentration 
by volume of carbon dioxide present in the dry gas with instrumentation 
which will result in a reading having an accuracy of <plus-minus>0.1 
percentage points.
    2.8  Energy flow instrumentation. Install one or more instruments, 
which measure the rate of gas flow or fuel oil supplied to the vented 
heater, and if appropriate, the electrical energy with an error no 
greater than one percent.
    2.9  Room ambient temperature. During the time period required to 
perform all the testing and measurement procedures specified in section 
3.0 of this appendix, maintain the room temperature within <plus-minus>5 
 deg.F (<plus-minus>2.8C) of the value T<INF>RA</INF> measured during 
the steady-state performance test. At no time during these tests shall 
the room temperature exceed 100  deg.F (37.8C) or fall below 65  deg.F 
(18.3C).
    Temperature (T<INF>RA</INF>) shall be the arithmetic average 
temperature of the test area, determined by measurement with four No. 24 
AWG bead-type thermocouples with junctions shielded against radiation, 
located approximately at 90-degree positions on a circle circumscribing 
the heater or heater
enclosure under test, in a horizontal plane approximately at the 
vertical midpoint of

[[Page 245]]

the appliance or test enclosure, and with the junctions approximately 24 
inches from sides of the heater or test enclosure and located so as not 
to be affected by other than room air. Locate a thermocouple at each 
elevation of draft relief inlet opening and combustion air inlet opening 
at a distance of approximately 24 inches from the inlet openings. The 
temperature of the air for combustion and the air for draft relief shall 
not differ more than <plus-minus>5  deg.F from room temperature as 
measured above.
    2.10  Equipment used to measure mass flow rate in flue and stack. 
The tracer gas chosen for this task should have a density which is less 
than or approximately equal to the density of air. Use a gas unreactive 
with the environment to be encountered. Using instrumentation of either 
the batch or continuous type, measure the concentration of tracer gas 
with an error no greater than 2 percent of the value of the 
concentration measured.
    3.0  Testing and measurements.
    3.1  Steady-state testing.
    3.1.1  Gas fueled vented home heating equipment (including direct 
vent systems). Set up the vented heater as specified in sections 2.1, 
2.2, and 2.3 of this appendix. The draft diverter shall be in the normal 
open condition and the stack shall not be insulated. (Insulation of the 
stack is no longer required for the vented heater test.) Begin the 
steady-state performance test by operating the burner and the 
circulating air blower, on units so equipped, with the adjustments 
specified by sections 2.4.1 and 2.5 of this appendix, until steady-state 
conditions are attained as indicated by a temperature variation of not 
more than 3  deg.F (1.7 C) in the stack gas temperature for vented 
heaters equipped with draft diverters or 5  deg.F (2.8 C) in the flue 
gas temperature for vented heaters equipped with either draft hoods or 
direct vent systems; in three successive readings taken 15 minutes 
apart.
    On units employing draft diverters, measure the room temperature 
(T<INF>RA</INF>) as described in section 2.9 of this appendix and 
measure the steady-state stack gas temperature (T<INF>S,SS</INF>) using 
the nine thermocouples located in the 5 foot test stack as specified in 
section 2.6.1 of this appendix. Secure a sample of the stack gases in 
the plane where T<INF>S,SS</INF> is measured or within 3.5 feet 
downstream of this plane. Determine the concentration by volume of 
carbon dioxide (X<INF>CO2S</INF>) present in the dry stack gas. If the 
location of the gas sampling differs from the temperature measurement 
plane, there shall be no air leaks through the stack between these two 
locations.
    On units employing draft hoods or direct vent systems, measure the 
room temperature (T<INF>RA</INF>) as described in section 2.9 of this 
appendix and measure the steady-state flue gas temperature 
(T<INF>F,SS</INF>), using the nine thermocouples located in the flue 
pipe as described in section 2.6.1 of this appendix. Secure a sample of 
the flue gas in the plane of temperature measurement and determine the 
concentration by volume of CO<INF>2</INF> (X<INF>CO2F</INF>) present in 
dry flue gas. In addition, for units employing draft hoods, secure a 
sample of the stack gas in a horizontal plane in the five foot test 
stack located one foot from the test stack inlet; and determine the 
concentration by volume of CO<INF>2</INF> (X<INF>CO2S</INF>) present in 
dry stack gas.
    Determine the steady-state heat input rate (Q<INF>in</INF>) 
including pilot gas by multiplying the measured higher heating value of 
the test gas by the steady-state gas input rate corrected to standard 
conditions of 60  deg.F and 30 inches of mercury. Use measured values of 
gas temperature and pressure at the meter and the barometric pressure to 
correct the metered gas flow rate to standard conditions.
    After the above test measurements have been completed on units 
employing draft diverters, secure a sample of the flue gases at the exit 
of the heat exchanger(s) and determine the concentration of 
CO<INF>2</INF> (X<INF>CO2F</INF>) present. In obtaining this sample of 
flue gas, move the sampling probe around or use a sample probe with 
multiple sampling ports in order to assure that an average value is 
obtained for the CO<INF>2</INF> concentration. For units with multiple 
heat exchanger outlets, measure the CO<INF>2</INF> concentration in a 
sample from each outlet to obtain the average CO<INF>2</INF> 
concentration for the unit. A manifold (parallel connected sampling 
tubes) may be used to obtain this sample.
    For heaters with single stage thermostat control (wall mounted 
electric thermostats), determine the steady-state efficiency at the 
maximum fuel input rate as specified in section 2.4 of this appendix.
    For gas fueled vented heaters equipped with either two stage 
thermostats or step-modulating thermostats, determine the steady-state 
efficiency at the maximum fuel input rate, as specified in section 2.4.1 
of this appendix, and at the reduced fuel input rate, as specified in 
section 2.4.1 of this appendix.
    For manually controlled gas fueled vented heaters, with various 
input rates determine the steady-state efficiency at a fuel input rate 
that is within <plus-minus>5 percent of 50 percent of the maximum fuel 
input rate. If the heater is designed to use a control that precludes 
operation at other than maximum output (single firing rate) determine 
the steady state efficiency at the maximum input rate only.
    3.1.2  Oil fueled vented home heating equipment (including direct 
vent systems). Set up and adjust the vented heater as specified in 
sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3.4 of this appendix. Begin the steady-state 
performance test by operating the burner and the circulating air blower, 
on units so equipped, with the adjustments specified by sections 2.4.2 
and 2.5

[[Page 246]]

of this appendix until steady-state conditions are attained as indicated 
by a temperature variation of not more than 5  deg.F (2.8 C) in the flue 
gas temperature in three successive readings taken 15 minutes apart.
    Do not allow smoke in the flue, for units equipped with power 
burners, to exceed a No. 1 smoke during the steady-state performance 
test as measured by the procedure described in ANSI standard Z11.182-
1965 (R1971) (ASTM D 2156-65 (1970)). Maintain the average draft over 
the fire and in the breeching during the steady-state performance test 
at that recommended by the manufacturer <plus-minus>0.005 inches of 
water gauge.
    Measure the room temperature (T<INF>RA</INF>) as described in 
section 2.9 of this appendix and measure the steady-state flue gas 
temperature (T<INF>F,SS</INF>) using nine thermocouples located in the 
flue pipe as described in section 2.6.2 of this appendix. Secure a 
sample of the flue gas in the plane of temperature measurement and 
determine the concentration by volume of 
CO<INF>2</INF>(X<INF>CO2F</INF>) present in dry flue gas. Measure and 
record the steady-state heat input rate (Q<INF>in</INF>).
    For manually controlled oil fueled vented heaters, determine the 
steady-state efficiency at a fuel input rate that is within 
<plus-minus>5 percent of 50 percent of the maximum fuel input rate.
    3.1.3  Auxiliary Electric Power Measurement. Allow the auxiliary 
electrical system of a gas or oil vented heater to operate for at least 
five minutes before recording the maximum auxiliary electric power 
measurement from the wattmeter. Record the maximum electric power 
(P<INF>E</INF>) expressed in kilowatts. For vented heaters with 
modulating controls, the recorded (P<INF>E</INF>) shall be maximum 
measured electric power multiplied by the following factor (R). For two 
stage controls, R=1.3. For step modulating controls, R=1.4 when the 
ratio of minimum-to-maximum fuel input is greater than or equal to 0.7, 
R=1.7 when the ratio of minimum-to-maximum fuel input is less than 0.7 
and greater than or equal to 0.5, and R=2.2 when the ratio of minimum-
to-maximum fuel input is less than 0.5.
    3.2  Jacket loss measurement. Conduct a jacket loss test for vented 
floor furnaces. Measure the jacket loss (L<INF>j</INF>) in accordance 
with the ANSI standard Z21.48-1976 section 2.12.
    3.3  Measurement of the off-cycle losses for vented heaters equipped 
with thermal stack dampers. Install the thermal stack damper according 
to the manufacturer's instructions. Unless specified otherwise, the 
thermal stack damper should be at the draft diverter exit collar. Attach 
a five foot length of bare stack to the outlet of the damper. Install 
thermocouples as specified in section 2.6.1 of this appendix.
    For vented heaters equipped with single stage thermostats, measure 
the off-cycle losses at the maximum fuel input rate. For vented heaters 
equipped with two stage thermostats, measure the off-cycle losses at the 
maximum fuel input rate and at the reduced fuel input rate. For vented 
heaters equipped with step-modulating thermostats, measure the off-cycle 
losses at the reduced fuel input rate.
    Let the vented heater heat up to a steady-state condition. Feed a 
tracer gas at a constant metered rate into the stack directly above and 
within one foot above the stack damper. Record tracer gas flow rate and 
temperature. Measure the tracer gas concentration in the stack at 
several locations in a horizontal plane through a cross section of the 
stack at a point sufficiently above the stack damper to ensure that the 
tracer gas is well mixed in the stack.
    Continuously measure the tracer gas concentration and temperature 
during a 10 minute cool down period. Shut the burner off and immediately 
begin measuring tracer gas concentration in the stack, stack 
temperature, room temperature, and barometric pressure. Record these 
values as the midpoint of each one-minute interval between burner shut 
down and ten minutes after burner shut down. Meter response time and 
sampling delay time shall be considered in timing these measurements.
    3.4  Measurement of the effectiveness of electro-mechanical stack 
dampers. For vented heaters equipped with electro-mechanical stack 
dampers, measure the cross sectional area of the stack (A<INF>s</INF>), 
the net area of the damper plate (A<INF>o</INF>), and the angle that the 
damper plate makes when closed with a plane perpendicular to the axis of 
the stack ([Omega]). The net area of the damper plate means the area of 
the damper plate minus the area of any holes through the damper plate.
    3.5  Pilot light measurement.
    3.5.1  Measure the energy input rate to the pilot light 
(Q<INF>P</INF>) with an error no greater than 3 percent for vented 
heaters so equipped.
    3.5.2  For manually controlled heaters where the pilot light is 
designed to be turned off by the user when the heater is not in use, 
that is, turning the control to the OFF position will shut off the gas 
supply to the burner(s) and to the pilot light, the measurement of 
Q<INF>P</INF> is not needed. This provision applies only if an 
instruction to turn off the unit is provided on the heater near the gas 
control valve (e.g. by label) by the manufacturer.

    3.6  Optional procedure for determining D<INF>p'</INF> 
D<INF>F'</INF> and D<INF>s</INF> for systems for all types of vented 
heaters. For all types of vented heaters, D<INF>p'</INF> D<INF>F'</INF> 
and D<INF>S</INF> can be measured by the following optional cool down 
test.
    Conduct a cool down test by letting the unit heat up until steady-
state conditions are reached, as indicated by temperature variation of 
not more than 5  deg.F (2.8  deg.C) in the flue gas temperature in three 
successive

[[Page 247]]

readings taken 15 minutes apart, and then shutting the unit off with the 
stack or flue damper controls by-passed or adjusted so that the stack or 
flue damper remains open during the resulting cool down period. If a 
draft was maintained on oil fueled units in the flue pipe during the 
steady-state performance test described in section 3.1 of this appendix, 
maintain the same draft (within a range of -.001 to +.005 inches of 
water gauge of the average steady-state draft) during this cool down 
period.
    Measure the flue gas mass flow rate (m<INF>F,OFF</INF>) during the 
cool down test described above at a specific off-period flue gas 
temperature and corrected to obtain its value at the steady-state flue 
gas temperature (T<INF>F,SS</INF>), using the procedure described below.
    Within one minute after the unit is shut off to start the cool down 
test for determining D<INF>F</INF>, begin feeding a tracer gas into the 
combustion chamber at a constant flow rate of V<INF>T</INF>, and at a 
point which will allow for the best possible mixing with the air flowing 
through the chamber. (On units equipped with an oil fired power burner, 
the best location for injecting this tracer gas appears to be through a 
hole drilled in the air tube.) Periodically measure the value of 
V<INF>T</INF> with an instantaneously reading flow meter having an 
accuracy of <plus-minus>3 percent of the quantity measured. Maintain 
V<INF>T</INF> at less than 1 percent of the air flow rate through the 
furnace. If a combustible tracer gas is used, there should be a delay 
period between the time the burner gas is shut off and the time the 
tracer gas is first injected to prevent ignition of the tracer gas.
    Between 5 and 6 minutes after the unit is shut off to start the cool 
down test, measure at the exit of the heat exchanger the average flue 
gas temperature, T*<INF>F,Off</INF>. At the same instant the flue gas 
temperature is measured, also measure the percent volumetric 
concentration of tracer gas C<INF>T</INF> in the flue gas in the same 
plane where T*<INF>F,Off</INF> is determined. Obtain the concentration 
of tracer gas using an instrument which will result in an accuracy of 
<plus-minus>2 percent in the value of C<INF>T</INF> measured. If use of 
a continuous reading type instrument results in a delay time between 
drawing of a sample and its analysis, this delay should be taken into 
account so that the temperature measurement and the measurement of 
tracer gas concentration coincide. In addition, determine the 
temperature of the tracer gas entering the flow meter (T<INF>T</INF>) 
and the barometric pressure (P<INF>B</INF>).
    The rate of the flue gas mass flow through the vented heater and the 
factors D<INF>P</INF>, D<INF>F</INF>, and D<INF>S</INF> are calculated 
by the equations in sections 4.5.1 through 4.5.3 of this appendix.

energy efficiency, energy use, or water use (in the case of faucets, 
showerheads, water closets, or urinals) of a covered product that is not 
identical to a Federal standard in effect under this subpart is 
preempted by that standard, except as provided for in sections 327 (b) 
and (c) of the Act.

                              1. Objectives

    This Appendix establishes procedures, interpretations and policies 
to guide the DOE in the consideration and promulgation of new or revised 
appliance efficiency standards under the Energy Policy and Conservation 
Act (EPCA). The Department's objectives in establishing these guidelines 
include:
    (a) Provide for early input from stakeholders. The Department seeks 
to provide opportunities for public input early in the rulemaking 
process so that the initiation and direction of rulemakings is informed 
by comment from interested parties. Under the guidelines established by 
this Appendix, DOE will seek early input from interested parties in 
setting rulemaking priorities and structuring the analyses for 
particular products. Interested parties will be invited to provide input 
for the selection of design options and will help DOE identify analysis, 
data, and modeling needs. DOE will gather input from interested parties 
through a variety of mechanisms, including public workshops.
    (b) Increase predictability of the rulemaking timetable. The 
Department seeks to make informed, strategic decisions about how to 
deploy its resources on the range of possible standards development 
activities, and to announce these prioritization decisions so that all 
interested parties have a common expectation about the timing of 
different rulemaking activities. The guidelines in this Appendix provide 
for setting priorities and timetables for standards development and test 
procedure modification and reflect these priorities in the Regulatory 
Agenda.
    (c) Increase use of outside technical expertise. The Department 
seeks to expand its use of outside technical experts in evaluating 
product-specific engineering issues to ensure that decisions on 
technical issues are fully informed. The guidelines in this Appendix 
provide for increased use of outside technical experts in developing, 
performing and reviewing the analyses. Draft analytical results will be 
distributed for peer and stakeholder review.
    (d) Eliminate problematic design options early in the process. The 
Department seeks to eliminate from consideration, early in the process, 
any design options that present unacceptable problems with respect to 
manufacturability, consumer utility, or safety, so that the detailed 
analysis can focus only on viable design options. Under the guidelines 
in this Appendix, DOE will eliminate from consideration design options 
if it concludes that manufacture, installation or service of the design 
will be impractical, or that the design option will adversely affect the 
utility of the product, or if the design has adverse safety or health 
impacts. This screening will be done at the outset of a rulemaking.
    (e) Fully consider non-regulatory approaches. The Department seeks 
to understand the effects of market forces and voluntary programs on 
encouraging the purchase of energy efficient products so that the 
incremental impacts of a new or revised standard can be accurately 
assessed and the Department can make informed decisions about where 
standards and voluntary ``market pull'' programs can be used most 
effectively. Under the guidelines in this Appendix, DOE will solicit 
information on the effectiveness of market forces and non-regulatory 
approaches for encouraging the purchase of energy efficient products, 
and will carefully consider this information in assessing the benefits 
of standards. In addition, DOE will continue to support voluntary 
efforts by manufacturers, retailers, utilities and others to increase 
product efficiency.
    (f) Conduct thorough analysis of impacts. In addition to 
understanding the aggregate costs and benefits of standards, the 
Department seeks to understand the distribution of those costs and 
benefits among consumers, manufacturers and others, and the uncertainty 
associated with these analyses of costs and benefits, so that any 
adverse impacts on significant subgroups and uncertainty concerning any 
adverse impacts can be fully considered in selecting a standard. Under 
the guidelines in this Appendix, the analyses will consider the 
variability of impacts on significant groups of manufacturers

[[Page 272]]

and consumers in addition to aggregate costs and benefits, report the 
range of uncertainty associated with these impacts, and take into 
account cumulative impacts of regulation on manufacturers.
    (g) Use transparent and robust analytical methods. The Department 
seeks to use qualitative and quantitative analytical methods that are 
fully documented for the public and that produce results that can be 
explained and reproduced, so that the analytical underpinnings for 
policy decisions on standards are as sound and well-accepted as 
possible. Under the guidelines in this Appendix, DOE will solicit input 
from interested parties in identifying analysis, data, and modeling 
needs with respect to measurement of impacts on manufacturers and 
consumers.
    (h) Articulate policies to guide selection of standards. The 
Department seeks to adopt policies elaborating on the statutory criteria 
for selecting standards, so that interested parties are aware of the 
policies that will guide these decisions. Under the guidelines in this 
Appendix, policies for screening design options, selecting candidate 
standard levels, selecting a proposed standard level, and establishing 
the final standard are established.
    (i) Support efforts to build consensus on standards. The Department 
seeks to encourage development of consensus proposals for new or revised 
standards because standards with such broad-based support are likely to 
balance effectively the economic, energy, and environmental interests 
affected by standards. Under the guidelines in this Appendix, DOE will 
support the development and submission of consensus recommendations for 
standards by representative groups of interested parties to the fullest 
extent possible.
    (j) Reduce time and cost of developing standards. The Department 
seeks to establish a clear protocol for initiating and conducting 
standards rulemakings in order to eliminate time-consuming and costly 
missteps. Under the guidelines in this Appendix, increased and earlier 
involvement by interested parties and increased use of technical experts 
should minimize the need for re-analysis. This process should reduce the 
period between the publication of an Advance Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (ANOPR) and the publication of a final rule to not more than 
18 months, and should decrease the government and private sector 
resources required to complete the standard development process.

                                2. Scope

    (a) The procedures, interpretations and policies described in this 
Appendix will be fully applicable to:
    (1) Rulemakings concerning new or revised Federal energy 
conservation standards for consumer products initiated after August 14, 
1996, and
    (2) Rulemakings concerning new or revised Federal energy 
conservation standards for consumer products that have been initiated 
but for which a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) has not been 
published as of August 14, 1996.
    (b) For rulemakings described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, 
to the extent analytical work has already been done or public comment on 
an ANOPR has already been provided, such analyses and comment will be 
considered, as appropriate, in proceeding under the new process.
    (c) With respect to incomplete rulemakings concerning new or revised 
Federal energy conservation standards for consumer products for which a 
NOPR was published prior to August 14, 1996, the Department will conduct 
a case-by-case review to decide whether any of the analytical or 
procedural steps already completed should be repeated. In any case, the 
approach described in this Appendix will be used to the extent possible 
to conduct any analytical or procedural steps that have not been 
completed.

              3. Setting Priorities for Rulemaking Activity

    (a) Priority-setting analysis and development of list of priorities. 
At least once a year, the Department will prepare an analysis of each of 
the factors identified in paragraph (d) of this section based on 
existing literature, direct communications with interested parties and 
other experts, and other available information. The results of this 
analysis will be used to develop rulemaking priorities and proposed 
schedules for the development and issuance of all rulemakings. The DOE 
analysis, priorities and proposed rulemaking schedules will be 
documented and distributed for review and comment.
    (b) Public review and comment. Each year, DOE will invite public 
input to review and comment on the priority analysis.
    (c) Issuance of final listing of rulemaking priorities. Each fall, 
the Department will issue, simultaneously with the issuance of the 
Administration's Regulatory Agenda, a final set of rulemaking 
priorities, the accompanying analysis, and the schedules for all 
priority rulemakings that it anticipates within the next two years.
    (d) Factors for priority-setting. The factors to be considered by 
DOE in developing priorities and establishing schedules for conducting 
rulemakings will include:
    (1) Potential energy savings.
    (2) Potential economic benefits.
    (3) Potential environmental or energy security benefits.
    (4) Applicable deadlines for rulemakings.
    (5) Incremental DOE resources required to complete rulemaking 
process.
    (6) Other relevant regulatory actions affecting products.

[[Page 273]]

    (7) Stakeholder recommendations.
    (8) Evidence of energy efficiency gains in the market absent new or 
revised standards.
    (9) Status of required changes to test procedures.
    (10) Other relevant factors.

    4. Process for Developing Efficiency Standards and Factors to be 
                               Considered

    This section describes the process to be used in developing 
efficiency standards and the factors to be considered in the process. 
The policies of the Department to guide the selection of standards and 
the decisions preliminary thereto are described in section 5.
    (a) Identifying and screening design options. Once the Department 
has initiated a rulemaking for a specific product but before publishing 
an ANOPR, DOE will identify the product categories and design options to 
be analyzed in detail, and identify those design options eliminated from 
further consideration. Interested parties will be consulted to identify 
key issues, develop a list of design options, and to help the Department 
identify the expertise necessary to conduct the analysis.
    (1) Identification of issues for analysis. The Department, in 
consultation with interested parties, will identify issues that will be 
examined in the standards development process.
    (2) Identification of experts and other interested parties for peer 
review. DOE, in consultation with interested parties, will identify a 
group of independent experts and other interested parties who can 
provide expert review of the results of the engineering analysis and the 
subsequent impact analysis.
    (3) Identification and screening of design options. In consultation 
with interested parties, the Department will develop a list of design 
options for consideration. Initially, the candidate design options will 
encompass all those technologies considered to be technologically 
feasible. Following the development of this initial list of design 
options, DOE will review each design option based on the factors 
described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section and the policies stated in 
section 5(b). The reasons for eliminating any design option at this 
stage of the process will be fully documented and published as part of 
the ANOPR. The technologically feasible design options that are not 
eliminated in this screening will be considered further in the 
Engineering Analysis described in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (4) Factors for screening of design options. The factors for 
screening design options include:
    (i) Technological feasibility. Technologies incorporated in 
commercial products or in working prototypes will be considered 
technologically feasible.
    (ii) Practicability to manufacture, install and service. If mass 
production of a technology in commercial products and reliable 
installation and servicing of the technology could be achieved on the 
scale necessary to serve the relevant market at the time of the 
effective date of the standard, then that technology will be considered 
practicable to manufacture, install and service.
    (iii) Adverse Impacts on Product Utility or Product Availability.
    (iv) Adverse Impacts on Health or Safety.
    (5) Selection of contractors. Using the specifications of necessary 
contractor expertise developed in consultation with interested parties, 
DOE will select appropriate contractors, subcontractors, and as 
necessary, expert consultants to perform the engineering analysis and 
the impact analysis.
    (b) Engineering analysis of design options and selection of 
candidate standard levels. After design options are identified and 
screened, DOE will perform the engineering analysis and the benefit/cost 
analysis and select the candidate standard levels based on these 
analyses. The results of the analyses will be published in a Technical 
Support Document (TSD) to accompany the ANOPR.
    (1) Identification of engineering analytical methods and tools. DOE, 
in consultation with outside experts, will select the specific 
engineering analysis tools (or multiple tools, if necessary to address 
uncertainty) to be used in the analysis of the design options identified 
as a result of the screening analysis.
    (2) Engineering and life-cycle cost analysis of design options. The 
DOE and its contractor will perform engineering and life-cycle cost 
analyses of the design options.
    (3) Review by expert group and stakeholders. The results of the 
engineering and life-cycle cost analyses will be distributed for review 
by experts and interested parties. If appropriate, a public workshop 
will be conducted to review these results. The analyses will be revised 
as appropriate on the basis of this input.
    (4) New information relating to the factors used for screening 
design options. If further information or analysis leads to a 
determination that a design option, or a combination of design options, 
has unacceptable impacts based on the policies stated in section 5(b), 
that design option or combination of design options will not be included 
in a candidate standard level.
    (5) Selection of candidate standard levels. Based on the results of 
the engineering and life-cycle cost analysis of design options and the 
policies stated in section 5(c), DOE will select the candidate standard 
levels for further analysis.
    (c) Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
    (1) Documentation of decisions on candidate standard selection. (i) 
If the screening analysis indicates that continued development of a 
standard is appropriate, the Department

[[Page 274]]

will publish an ANOPR in the Federal Register and will distribute a 
draft TSD containing the analyses performed to this point. The ANOPR 
will specify candidate standard levels but will not propose a particular 
standard. The ANOPR will also include the preliminary analysis of 
consumer life-cycle costs, national net present value, and energy 
impacts for the candidate standard levels based on the engineering 
analysis.
    (ii) If the preliminary analysis indicates that no candidate 
standard level is likely to meet the criteria specified in law, that 
conclusion will be announced. In such cases, the Department may decide 
to proceed with a rulemaking that proposes not to adopt new or amended 
standards, or it may suspend the rulemaking and conclude that further 
action on such standards should be assigned a low priority under section 
3.
    (2) Public comment and hearing. There will be 75 days for public 
comment on the ANOPR with at least one public hearing or workshop.
    (3) Revisions based on comments. Based on consideration of the 
comments received, any necessary changes to the engineering analysis or 
the candidate standard levels will be made.
    If major changes are required at this stage, interested parties and 
experts will be given an opportunity to review the revised analysis.
    (d) Analysis of impacts and selection of proposed standard level. 
After the ANOPR, economic analyses of the impacts of the candidate 
standard levels will be conducted. The Department will propose updated 
standards based on the results of the impact analysis.
    (1) Identification of issues for analysis. The Department, in 
consultation with interested parties, will identify issues that will be 
examined in the impacts analysis.
    (2) Identification of analytical methods and tools. DOE, in 
consultation with outside experts, will select the specific economic 
analysis tools (or multiple tools if necessary to address uncertainty) 
to be used in the analysis of the candidate standard levels.
    (3) Analysis of impacts. DOE will conduct the analysis of the 
impacts of candidate standard levels including analysis of the factors 
described in paragraphs (d)(7)(ii)-(viii) of this section.
    (4) Review by expert group and stakeholders. The results of the 
analysis of impacts will be distributed for review by experts and 
interested parties. If appropriate, a public workshop will be conducted 
to review these results. The analysis will be revised as appropriate on 
the basis of this input.
    (5) Efforts to develop consensus among stakeholders. If a 
representative group of interested parties undertakes to develop joint 
recommendations to the Department on standards, DOE will consider 
deferring its impact analysis until these discussions are completed or 
until participants in the efforts indicate that they are unable to reach 
a timely agreement.
    (6) Selection of proposed standard level based on analysis of 
impacts. On the basis of the analysis of the factors described in 
paragraph (d)(7) of this section and the policies stated in section 
5(e), DOE will select a proposed standard level.
    (7) Factors to be considered in selecting a proposed standard. The 
factors to be considered in selection of a proposed standard include:
    (i) Consensus stakeholder recommendations.
    (ii) Impacts on manufacturers. The analysis of manufacturer impacts 
will include: Estimated impacts on cash flow; assessment of impacts on 
manufacturers of specific categories of products and small 
manufacturers; assessment of impacts on manufacturers of multiple 
product-specific Federal regulatory requirements, including efficiency 
standards for other products and regulations of other agencies; and 
impact on manufacturing capacity, plant closures, and loss of capital 
investment.
    (iii) Impacts on consumers. The analysis of consumer impacts will 
include: Estimated impacts on consumers based on national average energy 
prices and energy usage; assessments of impacts on subgroups of 
consumers based on major regional differences in usage or energy prices 
and significant variations in installation costs or performance; 
sensitivity analyses using high and low discount rates and high and low 
energy price forecasts; consideration of changes to product utility and 
other impacts of likely concern to all or some consumers, based to the 
extent practicable on direct input from consumers; estimated life-cycle 
cost with sensitivity analysis; and consideration of the increased first 
cost to consumers and the time required for energy cost savings to pay 
back these first costs.
    (iv) Impacts on competition.
    (v) Impacts on utilities. The analysis of utility impacts will 
include estimated marginal impacts on electric and gas utility costs and 
revenues.
    (vi) National energy, economic and employment impacts. The analysis 
of national energy, economic and employment impacts will include: 
Estimated energy savings by fuel type; estimated net present value of 
benefits to all consumers; and estimates of the direct and indirect 
impacts on employment by appliance manufacturers, relevant service 
industries, energy suppliers and the economy in general.
    (vii) Impacts on the environment and energy security. The analysis 
of environmental and energy security impacts will include estimated 
impacts on emissions of carbon and relevant criteria pollutants, impacts 
on pollution control costs, and impacts on oil use.

[[Page 275]]

    (viii) Impacts of non-regulatory approaches. The analysis of energy 
savings and consumer impacts will incorporate an assessment of the 
impacts of market forces and existing voluntary programs in promoting 
product efficiency, usage and related characteristics in the absence of 
updated efficiency standards.
    (ix) New information relating to the factors used for screening 
design options.
    (e) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
    (1) Documentation of decisions on proposed standard selection. The 
Department will publish a NOPR in the Federal Register that proposes 
standard levels and explains the basis for the selection of those 
proposed levels, and will distribute a draft TSD documenting the 
analysis of impacts. As required by Sec. 325(p)(2) of EPCA, the NOPR 
also will describe the maximum improvement in energy efficiency or 
maximum reduction in energy use that is technologically feasible and, if 
the proposed standards would not achieve these levels, the reasons for 
proposing different standards.
    (2) Public comment and hearing. There will be 75 days for public 
comment on the NOPR, with at least one public hearing or workshop.
    (3) Revisions to impact analyses and selection of final standard. 
Based on the public comments received and the policies stated in section 
5(f), DOE will review the proposed standard and impact analyses, and 
make modifications as necessary. If major changes to the analyses are 
required at this stage, interested parties and experts will be given an 
opportunity to review the revised analyses.
    (f) Notice of Final Rulemaking. The Department will publish a Notice 
of Final Rulemaking in the Federal Register that promulgates standard 
levels and explains the basis for the selection of those standards, 
accompanied by a final TSD.

                 5. Policies on Selection of Standards.

    (a) Purpose. (1) Section 4 describes the process that will be used 
to consider new or revised energy efficiency standards and lists a 
number of factors and analyses that will be considered at specified 
points in the process. Department policies concerning the selection of 
new or revised standards, and decisions preliminary thereto, are 
described in this section.
    These policies are intended to elaborate on the statutory criteria 
provided in section 325 of the EPCA, 42 U.S.C. 6295.
    (2) The policies described below are intended to provide guidance 
for making the determinations required by EPCA. This statement of policy 
is not intended to preclude consideration of any information pertinent 
to the statutory criteria. The Department will consider all pertinent 
information in determining whether a new or revised standard is 
consistent with the statutory criteria. Moreover, the Department will 
not be guided by a policy in this section if, in the particular 
circumstances presented, such a policy would lead to a result 
inconsistent with the criteria in section 325 of EPCA.
    (b) Screening design options. Section 4(a)(4) lists factors to be 
considered in screening design options. These factors will be considered 
as follows in determining whether a design option will receive any 
further consideration:
    (1) Technological feasibility. Technologies that are not 
incorporated in commercial products or in working prototypes will not be 
considered further.
    (2) Practicability to manufacture, install and service. If it is 
determined that mass production of a technology in commercial products 
and reliable installation and servicing of the technology could not be 
achieved on the scale necessary to serve the relevant market at the time 
of the effective date of the standard, then that technology will not be 
considered further.
    (3) Impacts on product utility to consumers. If a technology is 
determined to have significant adverse impact on the utility of the 
product to significant subgroups of consumers, or result in the 
unavailability of any covered product type with performance 
characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, 
and volumes that are substantially the same as products generally 
available in the U.S. at the time, it will not be considered further.
    (4) Safety of technologies. If it is determined that a technology 
will have significant adverse impacts on health or safety, it will not 
be considered further.
    (c) Identification of candidate standard levels. Based on the 
results of the engineering and cost and benefit analyses of design 
options, DOE will identify the candidate standard levels for further 
analysis. Candidate standard levels will be selected as follows:
    (1) Costs and savings of design options. Design options which have 
payback periods that exceed the average life of the product or which 
cause life-cycle cost increases relative to the base case, using typical 
fuel costs, usage and discount rates, will not be used as the basis for 
candidate standard levels.
    (2) Further information on factors used for screening design 
options. If further information or analysis leads to a determination 
that a design option, or a combination of design options, has 
unacceptable impacts under the policies stated in paragraph (b) of this 
section, that design option or combination of design options will not be 
included in a candidate standard level.
    (3) Selection of candidate standard levels. Candidate standard 
levels, which will be identified in the ANOPR and on which impact 
analyses will be conducted, will be based on the remaining design 
options.

[[Page 276]]

    (i) The range of candidate standard levels will typically include:
    (A) The most energy efficient combination of design options;
    (B) The combination of design options with the lowest life-cycle 
cost; and
    (C) A combination of design options with a payback period of not 
more than three years.
    (ii) Candidate standard levels that incorporate noteworthy 
technologies or fill in large gaps between efficiency levels of other 
candidate standard levels also may be selected.
    (d) Advance notice of proposed rulemaking. New information provided 
in public comments on the ANOPR will be considered to determine whether 
any changes to the candidate standard levels are needed before 
proceeding to the analysis of impacts. This review, and any appropriate 
adjustments, will be based on the policies in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (e) Selection of proposed standard. Based on the results of the 
analysis of impacts, DOE will select a standard level to be proposed for 
public comment in the NOPR. Section 4(d)(7) lists the factors to be 
considered in selecting a proposed standard level. Section 325(o)(2)(A) 
of EPCA provides that any new or revised standard must be designed to 
achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency that is determined 
to be technologically feasible and economically justified.
    (1) Statutory policies. The fundamental policies concerning 
selection of standards are established in the EPCA, including the 
following:
    (i) A candidate standard level will not be proposed or promulgated 
if the Department determines that it is not technologically feasible and 
economically justified. See EPCA section 325(o)(3)(B). A standard level 
is economically justified if the benefits exceed the burdens. See EPCA 
section 325(o)(2)(B)(i). A standard level is rebuttably presumed to be 
economically justified if the payback period is three years or less. See 
EPCA section 325(o)(2)(B)(iii).
    (ii) If the Department determines that a standard level is likely to 
result in the unavailability of any covered product type with 
performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, 
capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as products 
generally available in the U.S. at the time, that standard level will 
not be proposed. See EPCA section 325(o)(4).
    (iii) If the Department determines that a standard level would not 
result in significant conservation of energy, that standard level will 
not be proposed. See EPCA section 325(o)(3)(B).
    (2) Selection of proposed standard on the basis of consensus 
stakeholder recommendations. Development of consensus proposals for new 
or revised standards is an effective mechanism for balancing the 
economic, energy, and environmental interests affected by standards. 
Thus, notwithstanding any other policy on selection of proposed 
standards, a consensus recommendation on an updated efficiency level 
submitted by a group that represents all interested parties will be 
proposed by the Department if it is determined to meet the statutory 
criteria.
    (3) Considerations in assessing economic justification.
    (i) The following policies will guide the application of the 
economic justification criterion in selecting a proposed standard:
    (A) If the Department determines that a candidate standard level 
would result in a negative return on investment for the industry, would 
significantly reduce the value of the industry, or would cause 
significant adverse impacts to a significant subgroup of manufacturers 
(including small manufacturing businesses), that standard level will be 
presumed not to be economically justified unless the Department 
determines that specifically identified expected benefits of the 
standard would outweigh this and any other expected adverse effects.
    (B) If the Department determines that a candidate standard level 
would be the direct cause of plant closures, significant losses in 
domestic manufacturer employment, or significant losses of capital 
investment by domestic manufacturers, that standard level will be 
presumed not to be economically justified unless the Department 
determines that specifically identified expected benefits of the 
standard would outweigh this and any other expected adverse effects.
    (C) If the Department determines that a candidate standard level 
would have a significant adverse impact on the environment or energy 
security, that standard level will be presumed not to be economically 
justified unless the Department determines that specifically identified 
expected benefits of the standard would outweigh this and any other 
expected adverse effects.
    (D) If the Department determines that a candidate standard level 
would not result in significant energy conservation relative to non-
regulatory approaches, that standard level will be presumed not to be 
economically justified unless the Department determines that other 
specifically identified expected benefits of the standard would outweigh 
the expected adverse effects.
    (E) If the Department determines that a candidate standard level is 
not consistent with the policies relating to practicability to 
manufacture, consumer utility, or safety in paragraphs (b) (2), (3) and 
(4) of this section, that standard level will be presumed not to be 
economically justified unless the Department determines that 
specifically identified expected benefits of the standard would outweigh 
this and any other expected adverse effects.

[[Page 277]]

    (F) If the Department determines that a candidate standard level is 
not consistent with the policies relating to consumer costs in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, that standard level will be presumed not to be 
economically justified unless the Department determines that 
specifically identified expected benefits of the standard would outweigh 
this and any other expected adverse effects.
    (G) If the Department determines that a candidate standard level 
will have significant adverse impacts on a significant subgroup of 
consumers (including low-income consumers), that standard level will be 
presumed not to be economically justified unless the Department 
determines that specifically identified expected benefits of the 
standard would outweigh this and any other expected adverse effects.
    (H) If the Department or the Department of Justice determines that a 
candidate standard level would have significant anticompetitive effects, 
that standard level will be presumed not to be economically justified 
unless the Department determines that specifically identified expected 
benefits of the standard would outweigh this and any other expected 
adverse effects.
    (ii) The basis for a determination that triggers any presumption in 
paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section and the basis for a determination 
that an applicable presumption has been rebutted will be supported by 
substantial evidence in the record and the evidence and rationale for 
making these determinations will be explained in the NOPR.
    (iii) If none of the policies in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section 
is found to be dispositive, the Department will determine whether the 
benefits of a candidate standard level exceed the burdens considering 
all the pertinent information in the record.
    (f) Selection of a final standard. New information provided in the 
public comments on the NOPR and any analysis by the Department of 
Justice concerning impacts on competition of the proposed standard will 
be considered to determine whether any change to the proposed standard 
level is needed before proceeding to the final rule. The same policies 
used to select the proposed standard level, as described in section 5(e) 
above, will be used to guide the selection of the final standard level.

                     6. Effective Date of a Standard

    The effective date for new or revised standards will be established 
so that the period between the publication of the final rule and the 
effective date is not less than any period between the dates for 
publication and effective date provided for in EPCA. The effective date 
of any revised standard will be established so that the period between 
the effective date of the prior standard and the effective date of such 
revised standard is not less than period between the two effective dates 
provided for in EPCA.

                           7. Test Procedures

    (a) Identifying the need to modify test procedures. DOE, in 
consultation with interested parties, experts, and the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology, will attempt to identify any 
necessary modifications to established test procedures when initiating 
the standards development process.
    (b) Developing and proposing revised test procedures. Needed 
modifications to test procedures will be identified in consultation with 
experts and interested parties early in the screening stage of the 
standards development process. Any necessary modifications will be 
proposed before issuance of an ANOPR in the standards development 
process.
    (c) Issuing final test procedure modification. Final, modified test 
procedures will be issued prior to the NOPR on proposed standards.
    (d) Effective date of modified test procedures. If required only for 
the evaluation and issuance of updated efficiency standards, modified 
test procedures typically will not go into effect until the effective 
date of updated standards.

                  8. Joint Stakeholder Recommendations

    (a) Joint recommendations. Consensus recommendations, and supporting 
analyses, submitted by a representative group of interested parties will 
be given substantial weight by DOE in the development of a proposed 
rule. See section 5(e)(2). If the supporting analyses provided by the 
group addresses all of the statutory criteria and uses valid economic 
assumptions and analytical methods, DOE expects to use this supporting 
analyses as the basis of a proposed rule. The proposed rule will explain 
any deviations from the consensus recommendations from interested 
parties.
    (b) Breadth of participation. Joint recommendations will be of most 
value to the Department if the participants are reasonably 
representative of those interested in the outcome of the standards 
development process, including manufacturers, consumers, utilities, 
states and representatives of environmental or energy efficiency 
interest groups.
    (c) DOE support of consensus development, including impact analyses. 
In order to facilitate such consensus development, DOE will make 
available, upon request, appropriate technical and legal support to the 
group and will provide copies of all relevant public documents and 
analyses. The Department also will consider any requests for its active 
participation in such discussions, recognizing that the procedural 
requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act may apply to such 
participation.

[[Page 278]]

          9. Principles for the Conduct of Engineering Analysis

    (a) The purpose of the engineering analysis is to develop the 
relationship between efficiency and cost of the subject product. The 
Department will use the most appropriate means available to determine 
the efficiency/cost relationship, including an overall system approach 
or engineering modeling to predict the improvement in efficiency that 
can be expected from individual design options as discussed in the 
paragraphs below. From this efficiency/cost relationship, measures such 
as payback, life cycle cost, and energy savings can be developed. The 
Department, in consultation with interested parties, will identify 
issues that will be examined in the engineering analysis and the types 
of specialized expertise that may be required. With these 
specifications, DOE will select appropriate contractors, subcontractors, 
and expert consultants, as necessary, to perform the engineering 
analysis and the impact analysis. Also, the Department will consider 
data, information and analyses received from interested parties for use 
in the analysis wherever feasible.
    (b) The engineering analysis begins with the list of design options 
developed in consultation with the interested parties as a result of the 
screening process. In consultation with the technology/industry expert 
peer review group, the Department will establish the likely cost and 
performance improvement of each design option. Ranges and uncertainties 
of cost and performance will be established, although efforts will be 
made to minimize uncertainties by using measures such as test data or 
component or material supplier information where available. Estimated 
uncertainties will be carried forward in subsequent analyses. The use of 
quantitative models will be supplemented by qualitative assessments as 
appropriate.
    (c) The next step includes identifying, modifying or developing any 
engineering models necessary to predict the efficiency impact of any one 
or combination of design options on the product. A base case 
configuration or starting point will be established as well as the order 
and combination/blending of the design options to be evaluated. The DOE, 
utilizing expert consultants, will then perform the engineering analysis 
and develop the cost efficiency curve for the product. The cost 
efficiency curve and any necessary models will be subject to peer review 
before being issued with the ANOPR.

       10. Principles for the Analysis of Impacts on Manufacturers

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of the manufacturer analysis is to identify 
the likely impacts of efficiency standards on manufacturers. The 
Department will analyze the impact of standards on manufacturers with 
substantial input from manufacturers and other interested parties. The 
use of quantitative models will be supplemented by qualitative 
assessments by industry experts. This section describes the principles 
that will be used in conducting future manufacturing impact analysis.
    (b) Issue identification. In the impact analysis stage (section 
4(d)), the Department, in consultation with interested parties, will 
identify issues that will require greater consideration in the detailed 
manufacturer impact analysis. Possible issues may include identification 
of specific types or groups of manufacturers and concerns over access to 
technology. Specialized contractor expertise, empirical data 
requirements, and analytical tools required to perform the manufacturer 
impact analysis also would be identified at this stage.
    (c) Industry characterization. Prior to initiating detailed impact 
studies, the Department will seek input on the present and past industry 
structure and market characteristics. Input on the following issues will 
be sought:
    (1) Manufacturers and their relative market shares;
    (2) Manufacturer characteristics, such as whether manufacturers make 
a full line of models or serve a niche market;
    (3) Trends in the number of manufacturers;
    (4) Financial situation of manufacturers;
    (5) Trends in product characteristics and retail markets; and
    (6) Identification of other relevant regulatory actions and a 
description of the nature and timing of any likely impacts.
    (d) Cost impacts on manufacturers. The costs of labor, material, 
engineering, tooling, and capital are difficult to estimate, 
manufacturer-specific, and usually proprietary. The Department will seek 
input from interested parties on the treatment of cost issues. 
Manufacturers will be encouraged to offer suggestions as to possible 
sources of data and appropriate data collection methodologies. Costing 
issues to be addressed include:
    (1) Estimates of total cost impacts, including product-specific 
costs (based on cost impacts estimated for the engineering analysis) and 
front-end investment/conversion costs for the full range of product 
models.
    (2) Range of uncertainties in estimates of average cost, considering 
alternative designs and technologies which may vary cost impacts and 
changes in costs of material, labor and other inputs which may vary 
costs.
    (3) Variable cost impacts on particular types of manufacturers, 
considering factors such as atypical sunk costs or characteristics of 
specific models which may increase or decrease costs.
    (e) Impacts on product sales, features, prices and cost recovery. In 
order to make manufacturer cash flow calculations, it is necessary to 
predict the number of products sold and

[[Page 279]]

their sale price. This requires an assessment of the likely impacts of 
price changes on the number of products sold and on typical features of 
models sold. Past analyses have relied on price and shipment data 
generated by economic models. The Department will develop additional 
estimates of prices and shipments by drawing on multiple sources of data 
and experience including: actual shipment and pricing experience, data 
from manufacturers, retailers and other market experts, financial 
models, and sensitivity analyses. The possible impacts of candidate 
standard levels on consumer choices among competing fuels will be 
explicitly considered where relevant.
    (f) Measures of impact. The manufacturer impact analysis will 
estimate the impacts of candidate standard levels on the net cash flow 
of manufacturers. Computations will be performed for the industry as a 
whole and for typical and atypical manufacturers. The exact nature and 
the process by which the analysis will be conducted will be determined 
by DOE, in conjunction with interested parties. Impacts to be analyzed 
include:
    (1) Industry net present value, with sensitivity analyses based on 
uncertainty of costs, sales prices and sales volumes;
    (2) Cash flows, by year;
    (3) Other measures of impact, such as revenue, net income and return 
on equity, as appropriate;
    The characteristics of atypical manufacturers worthy of special 
consideration will be determined in consultation with manufacturers and 
other interested parties and may include: manufacturers incurring higher 
or lower than average costs; and manufacturers experiencing greater or 
fewer adverse impacts on sales. Alternative scenarios based on other 
methods of estimating cost or sales impacts also will be performed, as 
needed.
    (g) Cumulative impacts of other Federal regulatory actions. (1) The 
Department will recognize and seek to mitigate the overlapping effects 
on manufacturers of new or revised DOE standards and other regulatory 
actions affecting the same products. DOE will analyze and consider the 
impact on manufacturers of multiple product-specific regulatory actions. 
These factors will be considered in setting rulemaking priorities, 
assessing manufacturer impacts of a particular standard, and 
establishing the effective date for a new or revised standard. In 
particular, DOE will seek to propose effective dates for new or revised 
standards that are appropriately coordinated with other regulatory 
actions to mitigate any cumulative burden.
    (2) If the Department determines that a proposed standard would 
impose a significant impact on product manufacturers within three years 
of the effective date of another DOE standard that imposes significant 
impacts on the same manufacturers (or divisions thereof, as 
appropriate), the Department will, in addition to evaluating the impact 
on manufacturers of the proposed standard, assess the joint impacts of 
both standards on manufacturers.
    (3) If the Department is directed to establish or revise standards 
for products that are components of other products subject to standards, 
the Department will consider the interaction between such standards in 
setting rulemaking priorities and assessing manufacturer impacts of a 
particular standard. The Department will assess, as part of the 
engineering and impact analyses, the cost of components subject to 
efficiency standards.
    (h) Summary of quantitative and qualitative assessments. The summary 
of quantitative and qualitative assessments will contain a description 
and discussion of uncertainties. Alternative estimates of impacts, 
resulting from the different potential scenarios developed throughout 
the analysis, will be explicitly presented in the final analysis 
results.
    (i) Key modeling and analytical tools. In its assessment of the 
likely impacts of standards on manufacturers, the Department will use 
models which are clear and understandable, feature accessible 
calculations, and have assumptions that are clearly explained. As a 
starting point, the Department will use the Government Regulatory Impact 
Model (GRIM). The Department will consider any enhancements to the GRIM 
that are suggested by interested parties. If changes are made to the 
GRIM methodology, DOE will provide notice and seek public input. The 
Department will also support the development of economic models for 
price and volume forecasting. Research required to update key economic 
data will be considered.

         11. Principles for the Analysis of Impacts on Consumers

    (a) Early consideration of impacts on consumer utility. The 
Department will consider at the earliest stages of the development of a 
standard whether particular design options will lessen the utility of 
the covered products to the consumer. See section 4(a).
    (b) Impacts on product availability. The Department will determine, 
based on consideration of information submitted during the standard 
development process, whether a proposed standard is likely to result in 
the unavailability of any covered product type with performance 
characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, 
and volumes that are substantially the same as products generally 
available in the U.S. at the time. DOE will not promulgate a standard if 
it concludes that it would result in such unavailability.
    (c) Department of justice review. As required by law, the Department 
will solicit the views of the Justice Department on any lessening of 
competition that is likely to result from

[[Page 280]]

the imposition of a proposed standard and will give the views provided 
full consideration in assessing economic justification of a proposed 
standard. In addition, DOE may consult with the Department of Justice at 
earlier stages in the standards development process to seek to obtain 
preliminary views on competitive impacts.
    (d) Variation in consumer impacts. The Department will use regional 
analysis and sensitivity analysis tools, as appropriate, to evaluate the 
potential distribution of impacts of candidate standards levels among 
different subgroups of consumers. The Department will consider impacts 
on significant segments of consumers in determining standards levels. 
Where there are significant negative impacts on identifiable subgroups, 
DOE will consider the efficacy of voluntary approaches as a means to 
achieve potential energy savings.
    (e) Payback period and first cost. (1) In the assessment of consumer 
impacts of standards, the Department will consider Life-Cycle Cost, 
Payback Period and Cost of Conserved Energy to evaluate the savings in 
operating expenses relative to increases in purchase price. The 
Department intends to increase the level of sensitivity analysis and 
scenario analysis for future rulemakings. The results of these analyses 
will be carried throughout the analysis and the ensuing uncertainty 
described.
    (2) If, in the analysis of consumer impacts, the Department 
determines that a candidate standard level would result in a substantial 
increase in the product first costs to consumers or would not pay back 
such additional first costs through energy cost savings in less than 
three years, Department will specifically assess the likely impacts of 
such a standard on low-income households, product sales and fuel 
switching.

             12. Consideration of Non-Regulatory Approaches

    (a) The Department recognizes that voluntary or other non-regulatory 
efforts by manufacturers, utilities and other interested parties can 
result in substantial efficiency improvements. The Department intends to 
consider fully the likely effects of non-regulatory initiatives on 
product energy use, consumer utility and life cycle costs, 
manufacturers, competition, utilities and the environment, as well as 
the distribution of these impacts among different regions, consumers, 
manufacturers and utilities. DOE will attempt to base its assessment on 
the actual impacts of such initiatives to date, but also will consider 
information presented regarding the impacts that any existing initiative 
might have in the future. Such information is likely to include a 
demonstration of the strong commitment of manufacturers, distribution 
channels, utilities or others to such voluntary efficiency improvements. 
This information will be used in assessing the likely incremental 
impacts of establishing or revising standards, in assessing appropriate 
effective dates for new or revised standards and in considering DOE 
support of non-regulatory initiatives.
    (b) DOE believes that non-regulatory approaches are valuable 
complements to the standards program. In particular, DOE will consider 
pursuing voluntary programs where it appears that highly efficient 
products can obtain a significant market share but less efficient 
products cannot be eliminated altogether because, for instance, of 
unacceptable adverse impacts on a significant subgroup of consumers. In 
making this assessment, the Department will consider the success more 
efficient designs have had in the market, their acceptance to date, and 
their potential market penetration.

                 13. Crosscutting Analytical Assumptions

    In selecting values for certain crosscutting analytical assumptions, 
DOE expects to continue relying upon the following sources and general 
principles:
    (a) Underlying economic assumptions. The appliance standards 
analyses will generally use the same economic growth and development 
assumptions that underlie the most current Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) 
published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
    (b) Energy price and demand trends. Analyses of the likely impact of 
appliance standards on typical users will generally adopt the mid-range 
energy price and demand scenario of the EIA's most current AEO. The 
sensitivity of such estimated impacts to possible variations in future 
energy prices are likely to be examined using the EIA's high and low 
energy price scenarios.
    (c) Product-specific energy-efficiency trends, without updated 
standards. Product specific energy-efficiency trends will be based on a 
combination of the efficiency trends forecast by the EIA's residential 
and commercial demand model of the National Energy Modeling System 
(NEMS) and product-specific assessments by DOE and its contractors with 
input from interested parties.
    (d) Discount rates. For residential and commercial consumers, ranges 
of three different real discount rates will be used. For residential 
consumers, the mid-range discount rate will represent DOE's 
approximation of the average financing cost (or opportunity costs of 
reduced savings) experienced by typical consumers. Sensitivity analyses 
will be performed using discount rates reflecting the costs more likely 
to be experienced by residential consumers with little or no savings and 
credit card financing and consumers with substantial savings. For 
commercial users, a mid-range discount rate reflecting the DOE's 
approximation of the average real rate of return on commercial 
investment

[[Page 281]]

will be used, with sensitivity analyses being performed using values 
indicative of the range of real rates of return likely to be experienced 
by typical commercial businesses. For national net present value 
calculations, DOE would use the Administration's approximation of the 
average real rate of return on private investment in the U.S. economy. 
For manufacturer impacts, DOE plans to use a range of real discount 
rates which are representative of the real rates of return experienced 
by typical U.S. manufacturers affected by the program.
    (e) Environmental impacts. The emission rates of carbon, sulfur 
oxides and nitrogen oxides used by DOE to calculate the physical 
quantities of emissions likely to be avoided by candidate standard 
levels will be based on the current average carbon emissions of the U.S. 
electric utilities and on the projected rates of emissions of sulfur and 
nitrogen oxides. Projected rates of emissions, if available, will be 
used for the estimation of any other environmental impacts. The 
Department will consider the effects of the proposed standards on these 
emissions in reaching a decision about whether the benefits of the 
proposed standards exceed their burdens but will not determine the 
monetary value of these environmental externalities.

             14. Deviations, Revisions, and Judicial Review

    (a) Deviations. This Appendix specifies procedures, interpretations 
and policies for the development of new or revised energy efficiency 
standards in considerable detail. As the approach described in this 
Appendix is applied to the development of particular standards, the 
Department may find it necessary or appropriate to deviate from these 
procedures, interpretations or policies. If the Department concludes 
that such deviations are necessary or appropriate in a particular 
situation, DOE will provide interested parties with notice of the 
deviation and an explanation.
    (b) Revisions. If the Department concludes that changes to the 
procedures, interpretations or policies in this Appendix are necessary 
or appropriate, DOE will provide notice in the Federal Register of 
modifications to this Appendix with an accompanying explanation. DOE 
expects to consult with interested parties prior to any such 
modification.
    (c) Judicial review. The procedures, interpretations, and policies 
stated in this Appendix are not intended to establish any new cause of 
action or right to judicial review.

Sec. 430.40  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart prescribes the procedures to be followed in 
connection with petitions requesting a rule that a State regulation 
prescribing an energy conservation standard, water conservation standard 
(in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals), or 
other requirement respecting energy efficiency, energy use, or water use 
(in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals) of a 
type (or class) of covered product not be preempted.
    (b) This subpart also prescribes the procedures to be followed in 
connection with petitions to withdraw a rule exempting a State 
regulation prescribing an energy conservation standard, water 
conservation standard (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water 
closets, and urinals), or other requirement respecting energy 
efficiency, energy use, or water use (in the case of faucets, 
showerheads, water closets, and urinals) of a type (or class) of covered 
product.

[63 FR 13318, Mar. 18, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 430.41  Prescriptions of a rule.

    (a) Criteria for exemption from preemption. Upon petition by a State 
which has prescribed an energy conservation standard, water conservation 
standard (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and 
urinals), or other requirement for a type or class of covered equipment 
for which a Federal energy conservation standard or water conservation 
standard is applicable, the Secretary shall prescribe a rule that such 
standard not be preempted if he determines that the State has 
established by a preponderance of evidence that such requirement is 
needed to meet unusual and compelling State or local energy interests or 
water interests. For the purposes of this section,

[[Page 282]]

the term ``unusual and compelling State or local energy interests or 
water interests'' means interests which are substantially different in 
nature or magnitude than those prevailing in the U.S. generally, and are 
such that when evaluated within the context of the State's energy plan 
and forecast, or water plan and forecast the costs, benefits, burdens, 
and reliability of energy savings or water savings resulting from the 
State regulation make such regulation preferable or necessary when 
measured against the costs, benefits, burdens, and reliability of 
alternative approaches to energy savings or water savings or production, 
including reliance on reasonably predictable market-induced improvements 
in efficiency of all equipment subject to the State regulation. The 
Secretary may not prescribe such a rule if he finds that interested 
persons have established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the 
State's regulation will significantly burden manufacturing, marketing, 
distribution, sale or servicing of the covered equipment on a national 
basis. In determining whether to make such a finding, the Secretary 
shall evaluate all relevant factors including: the extent to which the 
State regulation will increase manufacturing or distribution costs of 
manufacturers, distributors, and others; the extent to which the State 
regulation will disadvantage smaller manufacturers, distributors, or 
dealers or lessen competition in the sale of the covered product in the 
State; the extent to which the State regulation would cause a burden to 
manufacturers to redesign and produce the covered product type (or 
class), taking into consideration the extent to which the regulation 
would result in a reduction in the current models, or in the projected 
availability of models, that could be shipped on the effective date of 
the regulation to the State and within the U.S., or in the current or 
projected sales volume of the covered product type (or class) in the 
State and the U.S.; and the extent to which the State regulation is 
likely to contribute significantly to a proliferation of State appliance 
efficiency requirements and the cumulative impact such requirements 
would have. The Secretary may not prescribe such a rule if he finds that 
such a rule will result in the unavailability in the State of any 
covered product (or class) of performance characteristics (including 
reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are 
substantially the same as those generally available in the State at the 
time of the Secretary's finding. The failure of some classes (or types) 
to meet this criterion shall not affect the Secretary's determination of 
whether to prescribe a rule for other classes (or types).
    (1) Requirements of petition for exemption from preemption. A 
petition from a State for a rule for exemption from preemption shall 
include the information listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through 
(a)(1)(vi) of this section. A petition for a rule and correspondence 
relating to such petition shall be available for public review except 
for confidential or proprietary information submitted in accordance with 
the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information Regulations set forth 
in 10 CFR part 1004:
    (i) The name, address, and telephone number of the petitioner;
    (ii) A copy of the State standard for which a rule exempting such 
standard is sought;
    (iii) A copy of the State's energy plan or water plan and forecast;
    (iv) Specification of each type or class of covered product for 
which a rule exempting a standard is sought;
    (v) Other information, if any, believed to be pertinent by the 
petitioner; and
    (vi) Such other information as the Secretary may require.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) Criteria for exemption from preemption when energy emergency 
conditions or water emergency conditions (in the case of faucets, 
showerheads, water closets, and urinals) exist within State. Upon 
petition by a State which has prescribed an energy conservation standard 
or water conservation standard (in the case of faucets, showerheads, 
water closets, and urinals) or other requirement for a type or class of 
covered product for which a Federal energy conservation standard or 
water conservation standard is applicable, the Secretary may

[[Page 283]]

prescribe a rule, effective upon publication in the Federal Register, 
that such State regulation not be preempted if he determines that in 
addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section 
the State has established that: an energy emergency condition or water 
emergency condition exists within the State that imperils the health, 
safety, and welfare of its residents because of the inability of the 
State or utilities within the State to provide adequate quantities of 
gas, electric energy, or water to its residents at less than prohibitive 
costs; and cannot be substantially alleviated by the importation of 
energy or water or the use of interconnection agreements; and the State 
regulation is necessary to alleviate substantially such condition.
    (1) Requirements of petition for exemption from preemption when 
energy emergency conditions or water emergency conditions (in the case 
of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals) exist within a 
State. A petition from a State for a rule for exemption from preemption 
when energy emergency conditions or water emergency conditions exist 
within a State shall include the information listed in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(vi) of this section. A petition shall also 
include the information prescribed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through 
(b)(1)(iv) of this section, and shall be available for public review 
except for confidential or proprietary information submitted in 
accordance with the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information 
Regulations set forth in 10 CFR part 1004:
    (i) A description of the energy emergency condition or water 
emergency condition (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, 
and urinals) which exists within the State, including causes and 
impacts.
    (ii) A description of emergency response actions taken by the State 
and utilities within the State to alleviate the emergency condition;
    (iii) An analysis of why the emergency condition cannot be 
alleviated substantially by importation of energy or water or the use of 
interconnection agreements; and
    (iv) An analysis of how the State standard can alleviate 
substantially such emergency condition.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (c) Criteria for withdrawal of a rule exempting a State standard. 
Any person subject to a State standard which, by rule, has been exempted 
from Federal preemption and which prescribes an energy conservation 
standard or water conservation standard (in the case of faucets, 
showerheads, water closets, and urinals) or other requirement for a type 
or class of a covered product, when the Federal energy conservation 
standard or water conservation standard (in the case of faucets, 
showerheads, water closets, and urinals) for such product subsequently 
is amended, may petition the Secretary requesting that the exemption 
rule be withdrawn. The Secretary shall consider such petition in 
accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, 
except that the burden shall be on the petitioner to demonstrate that 
the exemption rule received by the State should be withdrawn as a result 
of the amendment to the Federal standard. The Secretary shall withdraw 
such rule if he determines that the petitioner has shown the rule should 
be withdrawn.
    (1) Requirements of petition to withdraw a rule exempting a State 
standard. A petition for a rule to withdraw a rule exempting a State 
standard shall include the information prescribed in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(vii) of this section, and shall be available 
for public review, except for confidential or proprietary information 
submitted in accordance with the Department of Energy's Freedom of 
Information Regulations set forth in 10 CFR part 1004:
    (i) The name, address and telephone number of the petitioner;
    (ii) A statement of the interest of the petitioner for which a rule 
withdrawing an exemption is sought;
    (iii) A copy of the State standard for which a rule withdrawing an 
exemption is sought;
    (iv) Specification of each type or class of covered product for 
which a rule withdrawing an exemption is sought;

[[Page 284]]

    (v) A discussion of the factors contained in paragraph (a) of this 
section;
    (vi) Such other information, if any, believed to be pertinent by the 
petitioner; and
    (vii) Such other information as the Secretary may require.
    (2) [Reserved]

Sec. 430.42  Filing requirements.

    (a) Service. All documents required to be served under this subpart 
shall, if mailed, be served by first class mail. Service upon a person's 
duly authorized representative shall constitute service upon that 
person.
    (b) Obligation to supply information. A person or State submitting a

conducted. The test notice may also provide for situations in which the 
selected basic model is unavailable for testing, and may include 
alternative basic models.
    (iv) The Secretary may require in the test notice that the 
manufacturer of a covered product shall ship at his expense a reasonable 
number of units of a basic model specified in such test notice to a 
testing laboratory designated by the Secretary. The number of units of a 
basic model specified in a test notice shall not exceed twenty (20).
    (v) Within 5 working days of the time units are selected, the 
manufacturer shall ship the specified test units of a basic model to the 
testing laboratory.
    (2) Testing Laboratory. Whenever DOE conducts enforcement testing at 
a designated laboratory in accordance with a test notice under this 
section, the resulting test data shall constitute official test data for 
that basic model. Such test data will be used by DOE to make a 
determination of compliance or noncompliance if a sufficient number of 
tests have been conducted to satisfy the requirements of appendix B of 
this subpart.
    (3) Sampling. The determination that a manufacturer's basic model 
complies with the applicable energy performance standard or water 
performance standard (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water 
closets, and urinals) shall be based on the testing conducted in 
accordance with the statistical sampling procedures set forth in 
appendix B of this subpart and the test procedures set forth in subpart 
B of this part.

[[Page 292]]

    (4) Test unit selection. A DOE inspector shall select a batch, a 
batch sample, and test units from the batch sample in accordance with 
the provisions of this paragraph and the conditions specified in the 
test notice.
    (i) The batch may be subdivided by DOE utilizing criteria specified 
in the test notice, e.g., date of manufacture, component-supplier, 
location of manufacturing facility, or other criteria which may 
differentiate one unit from another within a basic model.
    (ii) A batch sample of up to 20 units will then be randomly selected 
from one or more subdivided groups within the batch. The manufacturer 
shall keep on hand all units in the batch sample until such time as the 
basic model is determined to be in compliance or noncompliance.
    (iii) Individual test units comprising the test sample shall be 
randomly selected from the batch sample.
    (iv) All random selection shall be achieved by sequentially 
numbering all of the units in a batch sample and then using a table of 
random numbers to select the units to be tested.
    (5) Test unit preparation. (i) Prior to and during testing, a test 
unit selected in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section shall 
not be prepared, modified, or adjusted in any manner unless such 
preparation, modification, or adjustment is allowed by the applicable 
DOE test procedure. One test shall be conducted for each test unit in 
accordance with the applicable test procedures prescribed in subpart B.
    (ii) No quality control, testing or assembly procedures shall be 
performed on a test unit, or any parts and subassemblies thereof, that 
is not performed during the production and assembly of all other units 
included in the basic model.
    (iii) A test unit shall be considered defective if such unit is 
inoperative or is found to be in noncompliance due to failure of the 
unit to operate according to the manufacturer's design and operating 
instructions. Defective units, including those damaged due to shipping 
or handling, shall be reported immediately to DOE. DOE shall authorize 
testing of an additional unit on a case-by-case basis.
    (6) Testing at manufacturer's option. (i) If a manufacturer's basic 
model is determined to be in noncompliance with the applicable energy 
performance standard or water performance standard (in the case of 
faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals) at the conclusion of 
DOE testing in accordance with the double sampling plan specified in 
appendix B of this subpart, the manufacturer may request that DOE 
conduct additional testing of the model according to procedures set 
forth in appendix B of this subpart.
    (ii) All units tested under paragraph (a)(6) of this section shall 
be selected and tested in accordance with the provisions given in 
paragraphs (a) (1) through (5) of this section.
    (iii) The manufacturer shall bear the cost of all testing conducted 
under paragraph (a)(6) of this section.
    (iv) The manufacturer shall cease distribution of the basic model 
being tested under the provisions of paragraph (a)(6) of this section 
from the time the manufacturer elects to exercise the option provided in 
this paragraph until the basic model is determined to be in compliance. 
DOE may seek civil penalties for all units distributed during such 
period.
    (v) If the additional testing results in a determination of 
compliance, a notice of allowance to resume distribution shall be issued 
by the Department.
    (b) Design standard. In the case of a design standard, a model is 
determined noncompliant by DOE after the Secretary or his designated 
representative has examined the underlying design information provided 
by the manufacturer and after the manufacturer has been offered the 
opportunity to verify compliance with the applicable design standard.

Sec. 430.71  Cessation of distribution of a basic model.

    (a) In the event that a model is determined noncompliant by DOE in 
accordance with Sec. 430.70 of this part or if a manufacturer or private 
labeler determines a model to be in noncompliance, then the manufacturer 
or private labeler shall:

[[Page 293]]

    (1) Immediately cease distribution in commerce of the basic model;
    (2) Give immediate written notification of the determination of 
noncompliance, to all persons to whom the manufacturer has distributed 
units of the basic model manufactured since the date of the last 
determination of compliance.
    (3) Pursuant to a request made by the Secretary, provide DOE within 
30 days of the request, records, reports and other documentation 
pertaining to the acquisition, ordering, storage, shipment, or sale of a 
basic model determined to be in noncompliance.
    (4) The manufacturer may modify the noncompliant basic model in such 
manner as to make it comply with the applicable performance standard. 
Such modified basic model shall then be treated as a new basic model and 
must be certified in accordance with the provisions of this subpart; 
except that in addition satisfying all requirements of this subpart, the 
manufacturer shall also maintain records that demonstrate that 
modifications have been made to all units of the new basic model prior 
to distribution in commerce.
    (b) If a basic model is not properly certified in accordance with 
the requirements of this subpart, the Secretary may seek, among other 
remedies, injunctive action to prohibit distribution in commerce of such 
basic model.


<R05>
Sec. 430.72  Subpoena.

    Pursuant to section 329(a) of the Act, for purposes of carrying out 
this part, the Secretary or the Secretary's designee, may sign and issue 
subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the 
production of relevant books, records, papers, and other documents, and 
administer the oaths. Witnesses summoned under the provisions of this 
section shall be paid the same fees and mileage as are paid to witnesses 
in the courts of the United States. In case of contumacy by, or refusal 
to obey a subpoena served, upon any persons subject to this part, the 
Secretary may seek an order from the District Court of the United States 
for any District in which such person is found or resides or transacts 
business requiring such person to appear and give testimony, or to 
appear and produce documents. Failure to obey such order is punishable 
by such court as a contempt thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 430.73  Remedies.

    If DOE determines that a basic model of a covered product does not 
comply with an applicable energy conservation standard or water 
conservation standard (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water 
closets, and urinals):
    (a) DOE will notify the manufacturer, private labeler or any other 
person as required, of this finding and of the Secretary's intent to 
seek a judicial order restraining further distribution in commerce of 
such basic model unless the manufacturer, private labeler or any other 
person as required, delivers to DOE within 15 calendar days a statement, 
satisfactory to DOE, of the steps he will take to insure that the 
noncompliant model will no longer be distributed in commerce. DOE will 
monitor the implementation of such statement.
    (b) If the manufacturer, private labeler or any other person as 
required, fails to stop distribution of the noncompliant model, the 
Secretary may seek to restrain such violation in accordance with section 
334 of the Act.
    (c) The Secretary shall determine whether the facts of the case 
warrant the assessment of civil penalties for knowing violations in 
accordance with section 333 of the Act.

Sec. 430.74  Hearings and appeals.

    (a) Pursuant to section 333(d) of the Act, before issuing an order 
assessing a civil penalty against any person under this section, the 
Secretary shall provide to such person notice of the proposed penalty. 
Such notice shall inform such person of that person's opportunity to 
elect in writing within 30 days after the date of receipt of such notice 
to have the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section (in lieu of 
those in paragraph (b) of this section) apply with respect to such 
assessment.
    (b)(1) Unless an election is made within 30 calendar days after 
receipt of

[[Page 294]]

notice under paragraph (a) of this section to have paragraph (c) of this 
section apply with respect to such penalty, the Secretary shall assess

on the record after an opportunity for an agency hearing pursuant to 
section 554 of title 5, United States Code, before an administrative law 
judge appointed under section 3105 of such title 5. Such assessment 
order shall include the administrative law judge's findings and the 
basis for such assessment.
    (2) Any person against whom a penalty is assessed under this section 
may, within 60 calendar days after the date of the order of the 
Secretary assessing such penalty, institute an action in the United 
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate judicial circuit for 
judicial review of such order in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5, 
United States Code. The court shall have jurisdiction to enter a 
judgment affirming, modifying, or setting aside in whole or in part, the 
order of the Secretary, or the court may remand the proceeding to the 
Secretary for such further action as the court may direct.
    (c)(1) In the case of any civil penalty with respect to which the 
procedures of this section have been elected, the Secretary shall 
promptly assess such penalty, by order, after the date of the receipt of 
the notice under paragraph (a) of this section of the proposed penalty.
    (2) If the civil penalty has not been paid within 60 calendar days 
after the assessment has been made under paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, the Secretary shall institute an action in the appropriate 
District Court of the United States for an order affirming the 
assessment of the civil penalty. The court shall have authority to 
review de novo the law and the facts involved and shall have 
jurisdiction to enter a judgment enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as 
so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part, such assessment.
    (3) Any election to have this paragraph apply may not be revoked 
except with the consent of the Secretary.
    (d) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty 
after it has become a final and unappealable order under paragraph (b) 
of this section, or after the appropriate District Court has entered 
final judgment in favor of the Secretary under paragraph (c) of this 
section, the Secretary shall institute an action to recover the amount 
of such penalty in any appropriate District Court of the United States. 
In such action, the validity and appropriateness of such final 
assessment order or judgment shall not be subject to review.
    (e)(1) In accordance with the provisions of section 333(d)(5)(A) of 
the Act and notwithstanding the provisions of title 28, United States 
Code, or section 502(c) of the Department of Energy Organization Act, 
the Secretary shall be represented by the General Counsel of the 
Department of Energy (or any attorney or attorneys within DOE designated 
by the Secretary) who shall supervise, conduct, and argue any civil 
litigation to which paragraph (c) of this section applies including any 
related collection action under paragraph (d) of this section in a court 
of the United States or in any other court, except the Supreme Court of 
the United States. However, the Secretary or the General Counsel shall 
consult with the Attorney General concerning such litigation and the 
Attorney General shall provide, on request, such assistance in the 
conduct of such litigation as may be appropriate.
    (2) In accordance with the provisions of section 333(d)(5)(B) of the

   Appendix B to Subpart F of Part 430--Sampling Plan For Enforcement 
                                 Testing

                             Double Sampling

    Step 1. The first sample size (n<INF>1</INF>) must be four or more 
units.
    Step 2. Compute the mean (x<INF>1</INF>) of the measured energy 
performance or water performance (in the case of faucets, showerheads, 
water closets, and urinals) of the n<INF>1</INF> units in the first 
sample as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.010

where (x<INF>1</INF>) is the measured energy efficiency, energy or water 
(in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals) 
consumption of unit I.
    Step 3. Compute the standard deviation (s<INF>1</INF>) of the 
measured energy or water performance of the (n<INF>1</INF>) units in the 
first sample as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.011


[[Page 296]]


    Step 4. Compute the standard error (S<INF>X</INFS1) of the measured 
energy or water performance of the n<INF>1</INF> units in the first 
sample as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.012

    Step 5. Compute the upper control limit (UCL<INF>1</INF>) and lower 
control limit (LCL<INF>1</INF>) for the mean of the first sample using 
the applicable DOE energy or water performance standard (EPS) as the 
desired mean and a probability level of 95 percent (two-tailed test) as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.013

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.014

where t is a statistic based on a 95 percent two-tailed probability 
level and a sample size of n<INF>1</INF>.
    Step 6(a). For an Energy Efficiency Standard, compare the mean of 
the first sample (x<INF>1</INF>) with the upper and lower control limits 
(UCL<INF>1</INF> and LCL<INF>1</INF>) to determine one of the following:
    (1) If the mean of the first sample is below the lower control 
limit, then the basic model is in noncompliance and testing is at an 
end. (Do not go on to any of the steps below.)
    (2) If the mean of the first sample is equal to or greater than the 
upper control limit, then the basic model is in compliance and testing 
is at an end. (Do not go on to any of the steps below.)
    (3) If the sample mean is equal to or greater than the lower control 
limit but less than the upper control limit, then no determination of 
compliance or noncompliance can be made and a second sample size is 
determined by Step 7(a).
    Step 6(b). For an Energy or Water Consumption Standard, compare the 
mean of the first sample (x<INF>1</INF>) with the upper and lower 
control limits (UCL<INF>1</INF> and LCL<INF>1</INF>) to determine one of 
the following:
    (1) If the mean of the first sample is above the upper control 
limit, then the basic model is in noncompliance and testing is at an 
end. (Do not go on to any of the steps below.)
    (2) If the mean of the first sample is equal to or less than the 
lower control limit, then the basic model is in compliance and testing 
is at an end. (Do not go on to any of the steps below.)
    (3) If the sample mean is equal to or less than the upper control 
limit but greater than the lower control limit, then no determination of 
compliance or noncompliance can be made and a second sample size is 
determined by Step 7(b).
    Step 7(a). For an Energy Efficiency Standard, determine the second 
sample size (n<INF>2</INF>) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.015

    where s<INF>1</INF> and t have the values used in Steps 4 and 5, 
respectively. The term ``0.05 EPS'' is the difference between the 
applicable energy efficiency standard and 95 percent of the standard, 
where 95 percent of the standard is taken as the lower control limit. 
This procedure yields a sufficient combined sample size 
(n<INF>1</INF>+n<INF>2</INF>) to give an estimated 97.5 percent 
probability of obtaining a determination of compliance when the true 
mean efficiency is equal to the applicable standard. Given the solution 
value of n<INF>2</INF>, determine one of the following:
    (1) If the value of n<INF>2</INF> is less than or equal to zero and 
if the mean energy efficiency of the first sample (x<INF>1</INF>) is 
either equal to or greater than the lower control limit 
(LCL<INF>1</INF>) or equal to or greater than 95 percent of the 
applicable energy efficiency standard (EES), whichever is greater, i.e., 
if n<INF>2</INF> [le] 0 and x<INF>1</INF> [ge] max (LCL<INF>1</INF>, 
0.95 EES), the basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end.
    (2) If the value of n<INF>2</INF> is less than or equal to zero and 
the mean energy efficiency of the first sample (x<INF>1</INF>) is less 
than the lower control limit (LCL<INF>1</INF>) or less than 95 percent 
of the applicable energy efficiency standard (EES), whichever is 
greater, i.e., if n<INF>2</INF> [le] 0 and x<INF>1</INF> [ge] max 
(LCL<INF>1</INF>, 0.95 EES), the basic model is in noncompliance and 
testing is at an end.
    (3) If the value of n<INF>2</INF> is greater than zero, then value 
of the second sample size is determined to be the smallest integer equal 
to or greater than the solution value of n<INF>2</INF> for equation 
(6a). If the value of n<INF>2</INF> so calculated is greater than 20-
n<INF>1</INF>, set n<INF>2</INF> equal to 20-n<INF>1</INF>.
    Step 7(b). For an Energy or Water Consumption Standard, determine 
the second sample size (n<INF>2</INF>) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.016

where s<INF>1</INF> and t have the values used in Steps 4 and 5, 
respectively. The term ``0.05 EPS'' is the difference between the 
applicable energy or water consumption standard and 105 percent of the 
standard, where 105 percent of the standard is taken as the upper 
control limit. This procedure yields a sufficient combined sample size 
(n<INF>1</INF>+n<INF>2</INF>) to give an estimated 97.5 percent 
probability of obtaining a determination of compliance when the true 
mean consumption is equal to the applicable standard. Given the solution 
value of n<INF>2</INF>, determine one of the following:
    (1) If the value of n<INF>2</INF> is less than or equal to zero and 
if the mean energy or water consumption of the first sample 
(x<INF>1</INF>) is either equal to or less than the upper control limit 
(UCL<INF>1</INF>) or equal to or less than 105 percent of

[[Page 297]]

the applicable energy or water performance standard (EPS), whichever is 
less, i.e., if n<INF>2</INF> [le] 0 and x<INF>1</INF> [le] min 
(UCL<INF>1</INF>, 1.05 EPS), the basic model is in compliance and 
testing is at an end.
    (2) If the value of n<INF>2</INF> is less than or equal to zero and 
the mean energy or water consumption of the first sample (x<INF>1</INF>) 
is greater than the upper control limit (UCL<INF>1</INF>) or more than 
105 percent of the applicable energy or water performance standard 
(EPS), whichever is less, i.e., if n<INF>2</INF> [le] 0 and 
x<INF>1</INF> <ls-thn-eq> min (UCL<INF>1</INF>, 1.05 EPS), the basic 
model is in noncompliance and testing is at an end.
    (3) If the value of n<INF>2</INF> is greater than zero, then the 
value of the second sample size is determined to be the smallest integer 
equal to or greater than the solution value of n<INF>2</INF> for 
equation (6b). If the value of n<INF>2</INF> so calculated is greater 
than 20-n<INF>1</INF>, set n<INF>2</INF> equal to 20-n<INF>1</INF>.
    Step 8. Compute the combined mean (x<INF>2</INF>) of the measured 
energy or water performance of the n<INF>1</INF> and n<INF>2</INF> units 
of the combined first and second samples as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.017

    Step 9. Compute the standard error (S<INF>x</INF>1) of the measured 
energy or water performance of the n<INF>1</INF> and n<INF>2</INF> units 
in the combined first and second samples as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.018

    Note: s<INF>1</INF> is the value obtained in Step 3.

    Step 10(a). For an Energy Efficiency Standard, compute the lower 
control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>) for the mean of the combined first and 
second samples using the DOE energy efficiency standard (EES) as the 
desired mean and a one-tailed probability level of 97.5 percent 
(equivalent to the two-tailed probability level of 95 percent used in 
Step 5) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.019

where the t-statistic has the value obtained in Step 5.
    Step 10(b). For an Energy or Water Consumption Standard, compute the 
upper control limit (UCL<INF>2</INF>) for the mean of the combined first 
and second samples using the DOE energy or water performance standard 
(EPS) as the desired mean and a one-tailed probability level of 102.5 
percent (equivalent to the two-tailed probability level of 95 percent 
used in Step 5) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.020

where the t-statistic has the value obtained in Step 5.
    Step 11(a). For an Energy Efficiency Standard, compare the combined 
sample mean (x<INF>2</INF>) to the lower control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>) 
to find one of the following:
    (1) If the mean of the combined sample (x<INF>2</INF>) is less than 
the lower control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>) or 95 percent of the 
applicable energy efficiency standard (EES), whichever is greater, i.e., 
if x<INF>2</INF> < max (LCL<INF>2</INF>, 0.95 EES), the basic model is 
in noncompliance and testing is at an end.
    (2) If the mean of the combined sample (x<INF>2</INF>) is equal to 
or greater than the lower control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>) or 95 percent 
of the applicable energy efficiency standard (EES), whichever is 
greater, i.e., if x<INF>2</INF> [ge] max (LCL<INF>2</INF>, 0.95 EES), 
the basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end.
    Step 11(b). For an Energy or Water Consumption Standard, compare the 
combined sample mean (x<INF>2</INF>) to the upper control limit 
(UCL<INF>2</INF>) to find one of the following:
    (1) If the mean of the combined sample (x<INF>2</INF>) is greater 
than the upper control limit (UCL<INF>2</INF>) or 105 percent of the 
applicable energy or water performance standard (EPS), whichever is 
less, i.e., if x<INF>2</INF> <ls-thn-eq> min (UCL<INF>2</INF>, 1.05 
EPS), the basic model is in noncompliance and testing is at an end.
    (2) If the mean of the combined sample (x<INF>2</INF>) is equal to 
or less than the upper control limit (UCL<INF>2</INF>) or 105 percent of 
the applicable energy or water performance standard (EPS), whichever is 
less, i.e., if x<INF>2</INF> [le] min (UCL<INF>2</INF>, 1.05 EPS), the 
basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end.

                       Manufacturer-Option Testing

    If a determination of non-compliance is made in Steps 6, 7 or 11, 
the manufacturer may request that additional testing be conducted, in 
accordance with the following procedures.
    Step A. The manufacturer requests that an additional number, 
n<INF>3</INF>, of units be tested, with n<INF>3</INF> chosen such that 
n<INF>1</INF>+n<INF>2</INF>+n<INF>3</INF> does not exceed 20.
    Step B. Compute the mean energy or water performance, standard 
error, and lower or upper control limit of the new combined sample in 
accordance with the procedures prescribed in Steps 8, 9, and 10, above.
    Step C. Compare the mean performance of the new combined sample to 
the revised lower or upper control limit to determine one of the 
following:
    a.1. For an Energy Efficiency Standard, if the new combined sample 
mean is equal to or greater than the lower control limit or 95 percent 
of the applicable energy efficiency standard, whichever is greater, the 
basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end.
    a.2. For an Energy or Water Consumption Standard, if the new 
combined sample mean is equal to or less than the upper control limit or 
105 percent of the applicable energy or water consumption standard, 
whichever is

[[Page 298]]

less, the basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end.
    b.1. For an Energy Efficiency Standard, if the new combined sample 
mean is less than the lower control limit or 95 percent of the 
applicable energy efficiency standard, whichever, is greater, and the 
value of n<INF>1</INF>+n<INF>2</INF>+n<INF>3</INF> is less than 20, the 
manufacturer may request that additional units be tested. The total of 
all units tested may not exceed 20. Steps A, B, and C are then repeated.
    b.2. For an Energy or Water Consumption Standard, if the new 
combined sample mean is greater than the upper control limit or 105 
percent of the applicable energy or water consumption standard, 
whichever is less, and the value of 
n<INF>1</INF>+n<INF>2</INF>+n<INF>3</INF> is less than 20, the 
manufacturer may request that additional units be tested. The total of 
all units tested may not exceed 20. Steps A, B, and C are then repeated.
    c. Otherwise, the basic model is determined to be in noncompliance.

   Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 431--Policy Statement for Electric 
       Motors Covered Under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act

    This is a reprint of a policy statement which was published on 
November 5, 1997 at 62 FR 59978.

Policy Statement for Electric Motors Covered Under the Energy Policy and 
                            Conservation Act

                             I. Introduction

    The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), 42 U.S.C. 6311, et 
seq., establishes energy efficiency standards and test procedures for 
certain commercial and industrial electric motors manufactured (alone or 
as a component of another piece of equipment) after October 24, 1997, 
or, in the case of an electric motor which requires listing or 
certification by a nationally recognized safety testing laboratory, 
after October 24, 1999.\1\ EPCA also directs the Department of Energy 
(DOE or Department) to implement the statutory test procedures 
prescribed for motors, and to require efficiency labeling of motors and 
certification that covered motors comply with the standards.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The term ``manufacture'' means ``to manufacture, produce, 
assemble or import.'' EPCA section 321(10). Thus, the standards apply to 
motors produced, assembled, imported or manufactured after these 
statutory deadlines.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 340(13)(A) of EPCA defines the term ``electric motor'' based 
essentially on the construction and rating system in the National 
Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) Standards Publication MG1. 
Sections 340(13)(B) and (C) of EPCA define the terms ``definite purpose 
motor'' and ``special purpose motor,'' respectively, for which the 
statute prescribes no efficiency standards.
    In its proposed rule to implement the EPCA provisions that apply to 
motors (61 FR 60440, November 27, 1996), DOE has proposed to clarify the 
statutory definition of ``electric motor,'' to mean a machine which 
converts electrical power into rotational mechanical power and which: 
(1) is a general purpose motor, including motors with explosion-proof 
construction; \2\ (2) is a single speed, induction motor; (3) is rated 
for continuous duty operation, or is rated duty type S-1 (IEC) \3\; (4) 
contains a squirrel-cage or

[[Page 302]]

cage (IEC) rotor; (5) has foot-mounting, including foot-mounting with 
flanges or detachable feet; (6) is built in accordance with NEMA T-frame 
dimensions, or IEC metric equivalents (IEC); (7) has performance in 
accordance with NEMA Design A or B characteristics, or equivalent 
designs such as IEC Design N (IEC); and (8) operates on polyphase 
alternating current 60-Hertz sinusoidal power, and is (i) rated 230 
volts or 460 volts, or both, including any motor that is rated at multi-
voltages that include 230 volts or 460 volts, or (ii) can be operated on 
230 volts or 460 volts, or both.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Section 342(b)(1) of EPCA recognizes that EPCA's efficiency 
standards cover ``motors which require listing or certification by a 
nationally recognized safety testing laboratory.'' This applies, for 
example, to explosion-proof motors which are otherwise general purpose 
motors.
    \3\ Terms followed by the parenthetical ``IEC'' are referred to in 
the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Standard 34-1. Such 
terms are included in DOE's proposed definition of ``electric motor'' 
because DOE believes EPCA's efficiency requirements apply to metric 
system motors that conform to IEC Standard 34, and that are identical or 
equivalent to motors constructed in accordance with NEMA MG1 and covered 
by the statute.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Notwithstanding the clarification provided in the proposed rule, 
there still appears to be uncertainty as to which motors EPCA covers. It 
is widely understood that the statute covers ``general purpose'' motors 
that are manufactured for a variety of applications, and that meet 
EPCA's definition of ``electric motor.'' Many modifications, however, 
can be made to such generic motors. Motor manufacturers have expressed 
concern as to precisely which motors with such modifications are covered 
under the statute, and as to whether manufacturers will be able to 
comply with the statute by October 25, 1997 with respect to all of these 
covered motors. Consequently, motor manufacturers have requested that 
the Department provide additional guidance as to which types of motors 
are ``electric motors,'' ``definite purpose motors,'' and ``special 
purpose motors'' under EPCA. The policy statement that follows is based 
upon input from motor manufacturers and energy efficiency advocates, and 
provides such guidance.

    II. Guidelines for Determining Whether a Motor Is Covered by EPCA

                               A. General

    EPCA specifies minimum nominal full-load energy efficiency standards 
for 1 to 200 horsepower electric motors, and, to measure compliance with 
those standards, prescribes use of the test procedures in NEMA Standard 
MG1 and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc., (IEEE) 
Standard 112. In DOE's view, as stated in Assistant Secretary Ervin's 
letter of May 9, 1996, to NEMA's Malcolm O'Hagan, until DOE's 
regulations become effective, manufacturers can establish compliance 
with these EPCA requirements through use of competent and reliable 
procedures or methods that give reasonable assurance of such compliance. 
So long as these criteria are met, manufacturers may conduct required 
testing in their own laboratories or in independent laboratories, and 
may employ alternative correlation methods (in lieu of actual testing) 
for some motors. Manufacturers may also establish their compliance with 
EPCA standards and test procedures through use of third party 
certification or verification programs such as those recognized by 
Natural Resources Canada. Labeling and certification requirements will 
become effective only after DOE has promulgated a final rule prescribing 
such requirements.
    Motors with features or characteristics that do not meet the 
statutory definition of ``electric motor'' are not covered, and 
therefore are not required to meet EPCA requirements. Examples include 
motors without feet and without provisions for feet, and variable speed 
motors operated on a variable frequency power supply. Similarly, 
multispeed motors and variable speed motors, such as inverter duty 
motors, are not covered equipment, based on their intrinsic design for 
use at variable speeds. However, NEMA Design A or B motors that are 
single speed, meet all other criteria under the definitions in EPCA for 
covered equipment, and can be used with an inverter in variable speed 
applications as an additional feature, are covered equipment under EPCA. 
In other words, being suitable for use on an inverter by itself does not 
exempt a motor from EPCA requirements.
    Section 340(13)(F) of EPCA, defines a ``small electric motor'' as 
``a NEMA general purpose alternating current single-speed induction 
motor, built in a two-digit frame number series in accordance with NEMA 
Standards Publication MG 1-1987.'' Section 346 of EPCA requires DOE to 
prescribe testing requirements and efficiency standards only for those 
small electric motors for which the Secretary determines that standards 
are warranted. The Department has not yet made such a determination.

                         B. Electrical Features

    As noted above, the Department's proposed definition of ``electric 
motor'' provides in part that it is a motor that ``operates on polyphase 
alternating current 60-Hertz sinusoidal power, and * * * can be operated 
on 230 volts or 460 volts, or both.'' In DOE's view, ``can be operated'' 
implicitly means that the motor can be operated successfully. According 
to NEMA Standards Publication MG1-1993, paragraph 12.44, ``Variations 
from Rated Voltage and Rated Frequency,'' alternating-current motors 
must operate successfully under running conditions at rated load with a 
variation in the voltage or the frequency up to the following: plus or 
minus 10 percent of rated voltage, with rated frequency for induction 
motors; <SUP>4</SUP> plus or minus 5 percent of

[[Page 303]]

rated frequency, with rated voltage; and a combined variation in voltage 
and frequency of 10 percent (sum of absolute values) of the rated 
values, provided the frequency variation does not exceed plus or minus 5 
percent of rated frequency. DOE believes that, for purposes of 
determining whether a motor meets EPCA's definition of ``electric 
motor,'' these criteria should be used to determine when a motor that is 
not rated at 230 or 460 volts or 60 Hertz can be operated at such 
voltage and frequency.<SUP>5</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ For example, a motor that is rated at 220 volts should operate 
successfully on 230 volts, since 220 + .10(220) = 242 volts. A 208 volt 
motor, however, would not be expected to operate successfully on 230 
volts, since 208 + .10(208) = 228.8 volts.
    \5\ The Department understands that a motor that can operate at such 
voltage and frequency, based on variations defined for successful 
operation, will not necessarily perform in accordance with the industry 
standards established for operation at the motor's rated voltage and 
frequency. In addition, under the test procedures prescribed by EPCA, 
motors are to be tested at their rated values. Therefore, in DOE's view 
a motor that is not rated for 230 or 460 volts, or 60 Hertz, but that 
can be successfully operated at these levels, must meet the energy 
efficiency requirements at its rated voltage(s) and frequency. DOE also 
notes that when a motor is rated to include a wider voltage range that 
includes 230/460 volts, the motor should meet the energy efficiency 
requirements at 230 volts or 460 volts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NEMA Standards Publication MG1 categorizes electrical modifications 
to motors according to performance characteristics that include locked 
rotor torque, breakdown torque, pull-up torque, locked rotor current, 
and slip at rated load, and assigns design letters, such as Design A, B, 
C, D, or E, to identify various combinations of such electrical 
performance characteristics. Under section 340(13)(A) of EPCA, electric 
motors subject to EPCA efficiency requirements include only motors that 
fall within NEMA ``Design A and B * * * as defined in [NEMA] Standards 
Publication MG1-1987.'' As to locked rotor torque, for example, MG1 
specifies a minimum performance value for a Design A or B motor of a 
given speed and horsepower, and somewhat higher minimum values for 
Design C and D motors of the same speed and horsepower. The Department 
understands that, under MG1, the industry classifies a motor as Design A 
or B if it has a locked rotor torque at or above the minimum for A and B 
but below the minimum for Design C, so long as it otherwise meets the 
criteria for Design A or B. Therefore, in the Department's view, such a 
motor is covered by EPCA's requirements for electric motors. By contrast 
a motor that meets or exceeds the minimum locked rotor torque for Design 
C or D is not covered by EPCA. In sum, if a motor has electrical 
modifications that meet Design A or B performance requirements it is 
covered by EPCA, and if its characteristics meet Design C, D or E it is 
not covered.

    Motors designed for use on a particular type of application which 
are in a frame size that is one or more frame series larger than the 
frame size assigned to that rating by sections 1.2 and 1.3 of NEMA 
Standards Publication MG 13-1984 (R1990), ``Frame Assignments for 
Alternating Current Integral-Horsepower Induction Motors,'' are not, in 
the Department's view, usable in most general purpose applications. This 
is due to the physical size increase associated with a frame series 
change. A frame series is defined as the first two digits of the frame 
size designation. For example, 324T and 326T are both in the same frame 
series, while 364T is in the next larger frame series. Hence, in the 
Department's view, a motor that is of a larger frame series than 
normally assigned to that standard rating of motor is not covered by 
EPCA. A physically larger motor within the same frame series would be 
covered, however, because it would be usable in most general purpose 
applications.
    Motors built in a T-frame series or a T-frame size smaller than that 
assigned by MG 13-1984 (R1990) are also considered usable in most 
general purpose applications. This is because simple modifications can 
generally be made to fit a smaller motor in place of a motor with a 
larger frame size assigned in conformity with NEMA MG 13. Therefore, DOE 
believes that such smaller motors are covered by EPCA.

                          D. Motors with Seals

    Some electric motors have seals to prevent ingress of water, dust, 
oil, and other foreign materials into the motor. DOE understands that, 
typically, a manufacturer will add seals to a motor that it 
manufactures, so that it will sell two motors that are identical except 
that one has seals and the other does not. In such a situation, if the 
motor without seals is ``general purpose'' and covered by EPCA's 
efficiency requirements, then the motor with seals will also be covered 
because it can still be used in most general purpose applications. DOE 
understands, however, that manufacturers previously believed motors with 
seals were not covered under EPCA, in part because IEEE Standard 112, 
``Test Procedure for Polyphase Induction Motors and Generators,'' 
prescribed by EPCA, does not address how to test a motor with seals 
installed.
    The efficiency rating of such a motor, if determined with seals 
installed and when the motor is new, apparently would significantly

[[Page 304]]

understate the efficiency of the motor as operated. New seals are stiff, 
and provide friction that is absent after their initial break-in period. 
DOE understands that, after this initial period, the efficiency ratings 
determined for the same motor with and without seals would be virtually 
identical. To construe EPCA, therefore, as requiring such separate 
efficiency determinations would impose an unnecessary burden on 
manufacturers.
    In light of the foregoing, the Department believes that EPCA 
generally permits the efficiency of a motor with seals to be determined 
without the seals installed. Furthermore, notwithstanding the prior 
belief that such motors are not covered by EPCA, use of this approach to 
determining efficiency will enable manufacturers to meet EPCA's 
standards with respect to covered motors with seals by the date the 
standards go into effect on October 25, 1997.

   III. Discussion of How DOE Would Apply EPCA Definitions, Using the 
                          Foregoing Guidelines

    Using the foregoing guidelines, the attached matrix provides DOE's 
view as to which motors with common features are covered by EPCA. 
Because manufacturers produce many basic models that have many 
modifications of generic general purpose motors, the Department does not 
represent that the matrix is all-inclusive. Rather it is a set of 
examples demonstrating how DOE would apply EPCA definitions, as 
construed by the above guidelines, to various motor types. By extension 
of these examples, most motors currently in production, or to be 
designed in the future, could probably be classified. The matrix 
classifies motors into five categories, which are discussed in the 
following passages.

    Category I--For ``electric motors'' (manufactured alone or as a 
component of another piece of equipment) in Category I, DOE will enforce 
 EPCA efficiency standards and test procedures beginning on October 25, 
                                  1997

    The Department understands that some motors essentially are 
relatively simple modifications of generic general purpose motors. 
Modifications could consist, for example, of minor changes such as the 
addition of temperature sensors or a heater, the addition of a shaft 
extension and a brake disk from a kit, or changes in exterior features 
such as the motor housing. Such motors can still be used for most 
general purpose applications, and the modifications have little or no 
effect on motor performance. Nor do the modifications affect energy 
efficiency.

Category II--For certain motors that are ``definite purpose'' according 
   to present industry practice, but that can be used in most general 
    purpose applications, DOE will generally enforce EPCA efficiency 
 standards and test procedures beginning no later than October 25, 1999

                            General Statement

    EPCA does not prescribe standards and test procedures for ``definite 
purpose motors.'' Section 340(13)(B) of EPCA defines the term ``definite 
purpose motor'' as ``any motor designed in standard ratings with 
standard operating characteristics or standard mechanical construction 
for use under service conditions other than usual or for use on a 
particular type of application and which cannot be used in most general 
purpose applications.'' [Emphasis added.] Except, significantly, for 
exclusion of the italicized language, the industry definition of 
``definite purpose motor,'' set forth in NEMA MG1, is identical to the 
foregoing.
    Category II consists of electric motors with horsepower ratings that 
fall between the horsepower ratings in section 342(b)(1) of EPCA, 
thermally protected motors, and motors with roller bearings. As with 
motors in Category I, these motors are essentially modifications of 
generic general purpose motors. Generally, however, the modifications 
contained in these motors are more extensive and complex than the 
modifications in Category I motors. These Category II motors have been 
considered ``definite purpose'' in common industry parlance, but are 
covered equipment under EPCA because they can be used in most general 
purpose applications.
    According to statements provided during the January 15, 1997, Public 
Hearing, Tr. pgs. 238-239, Category II motors were, until recently, 
viewed by most manufacturers as definite purpose motors, consistent with 
the industry definition that did not contain the clause ``which cannot 
be used in most general purpose applications.'' Hence, DOE understands 
that many manufacturers assumed these motors were not subject to EPCA's 
efficiency standards. During the period prior and subsequent to the 
hearing, discussions among manufacturers resulted in a new understanding 
that such motors are general purpose under EPCA, since they can be used 
in most general purpose applications. Thus, the industry only recently 
recognized that such motors are covered under EPCA. Although the 
statutory definition adopted in 1992 contained the above-quoted 
definition of ``definite purpose,'' the delay in issuing regulations 
which embody this definition may have contributed to industry's delay in 
recognizing that these motors are covered.
    The Department understands that redesign and testing these motors in 
order to meet the efficiency standards in the statute may require a 
substantial amount of time. Given

[[Page 305]]

the recent recognition that they are covered, it is not realistic to 
expect these motors will be able to comply by October 25, 1997. A 
substantial period beyond that will be required. Moreover, the 
Department believes different manufacturers will need to take different 
approaches to achieving compliance with respect to these motors, and 
that, for a particular type of motor, some manufacturers will be able to 
comply sooner than others. Thus, the Department intends to refrain from 
taking enforcement action for two years, until October 25, 1999, with 
respect to motors with horsepower ratings that fall between the 
horsepower ratings in section 342(b)(1) of EPCA, thermally protected 
motors, and motors with roller bearings. Manufacturers are encouraged, 
however, to manufacture these motors in compliance with EPCA at the 
earliest possible date.
    The following sets forth in greater detail, for each of these types 
of motors, the basis for the Department's policy to refrain from 
enforcement for two years. Also set forth is additional explanation of 
the Department's understanding as to why manufacturers previously 
believed intermediate horsepower motors were not covered by EPCA.

                     Intermediate Horsepower Ratings

    Section 342(b)(1) of EPCA specifies efficiency standards for 
electric motors with 19 specific horsepower ratings, ranging from one 
through 200 horsepower. Each is a preferred or standardized horsepower 
rating as reflected in the table in NEMA Standards Publication MG1-1993, 
paragraph 10.32.4, Polyphase Medium Induction Motors. However, an 
``electric motor,'' as defined by EPCA, can be built at other horsepower 
ratings, such as 6 horsepower, 65 horsepower, or 175 horsepower. Such 
motors, rated at horsepower levels between any two adjacent horsepower 
ratings identified in section 342(b)(1) of EPCA will be referred to as 
``intermediate horsepower motors.'' In the Department's view, efficiency 
standards apply to every motor that has a rating from one through 200 
horsepower (or kilowatt equivalents), and that otherwise meets the 
criteria for an ``electric motor'' under EPCA, including an electric 
motor with an intermediate horsepower (or kW) rating.
    To date, these motors have typically been designed in conjunction 
with and supplied to a specific customer to fulfill certain performance 
and design requirements of a particular application, as for example to 
run a certain type of equipment. See the discussion in Section IV below 
on ``original equipment'' and ``original equipment manufacturers.'' In 
large part for these reasons, manufacturers believed intermediate 
horsepower motors to be ``definite purpose motors'' that were not 
covered by EPCA. Despite their specific uses, however, these motors are 
electric motors under EPCA when they are capable of being used in most 
general purpose applications.
    Features of a motor that are directly related to its horsepower 
rating include its physical size, and the ratings of its controller and 
protective devices. These aspects of a 175 horsepower motor, for 
example, which is an intermediate horsepower motor, must be appropriate 
to that horsepower, and would generally differ from the same aspects of 
150 and 200 horsepower motors, the two standard horsepower ratings 
closest to 175. To re-design an existing intermediate horsepower 
electric motor so that it complies with EPCA could involve all of these 
elements of a motor's design. For example, the addition of material 
necessary to achieve EPCA's prescribed level of efficiency could cause 
the size of the motor to increase. The addition of magnetic material 
would invite higher inrush current that could cause an incorrectly sized 
motor controller to malfunction, or the circuit breaker with a standard 
rating to trip unnecessarily, or both. The Department believes motor 
manufacturers will require a substantial amount of time to redesign and 
retest each intermediate horsepower electric motor they manufacture.
    To the extent such intermediate horsepower electric motors become 
unavailable because motor manufacturers have recognized only recently 
that they are covered by EPCA, equipment in which they are incorporated 
would temporarily become unavailable also. Moreover, re-design of such a 
motor to comply with EPCA could cause changes in the motor that require 
re-design of the equipment in which the motor is used. For example, if 
an intermediate horsepower electric motor becomes larger, it might no 
longer fit in the equipment for which it was designed. In such 
instances, the equipment would have to be re-designed. Because these 
motors were previously thought not to be covered, equipment 
manufacturers may not have had sufficient lead time to make the 
necessary changes to the equipment without interrupting its production.
    With respect to intermediate horsepower motors, the Department 
intends to refrain from enforcing EPCA for a period of 24 months only as 
to such motor designs that were being manufactured prior to the date 
this Policy Statement was issued. The Department is concerned that small 
adjustments could be made to the horsepower rating of an existing 
electric motor, in an effort to delay compliance with EPCA, if it 
delayed enforcement as to all intermediate horsepower motors produced 
during the 24 month period. For example, a 50 horsepower motor that has 
a service factor of 1.15 could be renameplated as a 57\1/2\ horsepower 
motor that has a 1.0 service factor. By making this delay in enforcement 
applicable only to pre-existing designs of intermediate horsepower

[[Page 306]]

motors, the Department believes it has made adequate provision for the 
manufacture of bona fide intermediate horsepower motor designs that 
cannot be changed to be in compliance with EPCA by October 25, 1997.

                       Thermally Protected Motors

    The Department understands that in order to redesign a thermally 
protected motor to improve its efficiency so that it complies with EPCA, 
various changes in the windings must be made which will require the 
thermal protector to be re-selected. Such devices sense the inrush and 
running current of the motor, as well as the operating temperature. Any 
changes to a motor that affect these characteristics will prevent the 
protector from operating correctly. When a new protector is selected, 
the motor must be tested to verify proper operation of the device in the 
motor. The motor manufacturer would test the locked rotor and overload 
conditions, which could take several days, and the results may dictate 
that a second selection is needed with additional testing. When the 
manufacturer has finished testing, typically the manufacturer will have 
a third party conduct additional testing. This testing may include 
cycling the motor in a locked-rotor condition to verify that the 
protector functions properly. This testing may take days or even weeks 
to perform for a particular model of motor.
    Since it was only recently recognized by industry that these motors 
are covered by EPCA, in the Department's view the total testing program 
makes it impossible for manufacturers to comply with the EPCA efficiency 
levels in thermally protected motors by October 25, 1997, especially 
since each different motor winding must be tested and motor winding/
thermal protector combinations number in the thousands.

                       Motors With Roller Bearings

    Motors with roller bearings fit within the definition of electric 
motor under the statute. However, because the IEEE Standard 112 Test 
Method B does not provide measures to test motors with roller bearings 
installed, manufacturers mistakenly believed such motors were not 
covered. Under IEEE Standard 112, a motor with roller bearings could 
only be tested for efficiency with the roller bearings removed and 
standard ball bearings installed as temporary substitutes. Then on the 
basis of the energy efficiency information gained from that test, the 
manufacturer may need to redesign the motor in order to comply with the 
statute. In this situation, the Department understands that testing, 
redesigning, and retesting lines of motors with roller bearings, to 
establish compliance, would be difficult and time consuming.

    Categories III, IV and V--Motors not within EPCA's definition of 
               ``electric motor,'' and not covered by EPCA

                        Close-coupled Pump Motors

    NEMA Standards Publication MG1-1993, with revisions one through 
three, Part 18, ``Definite-Purpose Machines,'' defines ``a face-mounting 
close-coupled pump motor'' as ``a medium alternating-current squirrel-
cage induction open or totally enclosed motor, with or without feet, 
having a shaft suitable for mounting an impeller and sealing device.'' 
Paragraphs MG1-18.601-18.614 specify its performance, face and shaft 
mounting dimensions, and frame assignments that replace the suffix 
letters T and TS with the suffix letters JM and JP.
    The Department understands that such motors are designed in standard 
ratings with standard operating characteristics for use in certain 
close-coupled pumps and pumping applications, but cannot be used in non-
pumping applications, such as, for example, conveyors. Consequently, the 
Department believes close-coupled pump motors are definite-purpose 
motors not covered by EPCA. However, a motor that meets EPCA's 
definition of ``electric motor,'' and which can be coupled to a pump, 
for example by means of a C-face or D-flange endshield, as depicted in 
NEMA Standards Publication MG1, Part 4, ``Dimensions, Tolerances, and 
Mounting,'' is covered.

  Totally-enclosed Non-ventilated (TENV) and Totally-enclosed Air-over 
                              (TEAO) Motors

    A motor designated in NEMA MG1-1993, paragraph MG1-1.26.1, as 
``totally-enclosed non-ventilated (IP54, IC410)'' <SUP>6</SUP> is ``not 
equipped for cooling by means external to the enclosing parts.'' This 
means that the motor, when properly applied, does not require the use of 
any additional means of cooling installed external to the motor 
enclosure. The TENV motor is cooled by natural conduction and natural 
convection of the motor heat into the surrounding environment. As stated 
in NEMA MG1-1993, Suggested Standard for Future Design, paragraph MG1-
1.26.1a, a TENV motor ``is only

[[Page 307]]

equipped for cooling by free convection.'' The general requirement for 
the installation of the TENV motor is that it not be placed in a 
restricted space that would inhibit this natural dissipation of the 
motor heat. Most general purpose applications use motors which include a 
means for forcing air flow through or around the motor and usually 
through the enclosed space and, therefore, can be used in spaces that 
are more restrictive than those required for TENV motors. Placing a TENV 
motor in such common restricted areas is likely to cause the motor to 
overheat. The TENV motor may also be larger than the motors used in most 
general purpose applications, and would take up more of the available 
space, thus reducing the size of the open area surrounding the motor. 
Installation of a TENV motor might require, therefore, an additional 
means of ventilation to continually exchange the ambient around the 
motor.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ IP refers to the IEC Standard 34-5: Classification of degrees of 
protection provided by enclosures for rotating machines. IC refers to 
the IEC Standard 34-6: Methods of cooling rotating machinery. The IP and 
IC codes are referenced in the NEMA designations for TENV and TEAO 
motors in MG1-1993 Part 1, ``Classification According to Environmental 
Protection and Methods of Cooling,'' as a Suggested Standard for Future 
Design, since the TENV and TEAO motors conform to IEC Standards. Details 
of protection (IP) and methods of cooling (IC) are defined in MG1 Part 5 
and Part 6, respectively.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A motor designated in NEMA MG1-1993 as ``totally-enclosed air-over 
(IP54, IC417)'' is intended to be cooled by ventilation means external 
to (i.e., separate and independent from) the motor, such as a fan. The 
motor must be provided with the additional ventilation to prevent it 
from overheating.
    Consequently, neither the TENV motor nor the TEAO motor would be 
suitable for most general purpose applications, and, DOE believes they 
are definite-purpose motors not covered by EPCA.

                           Integral Gearmotors

    An ``integral gearmotor'' is an assembly of a motor and a specific 
gear drive or assembly of gears, such as a gear reducer, as a unified 
package. The motor portion of an integral gearmotor is not necessarily a 
complete motor, since the end bracket or mounting flange of the motor 
portion is also part of the gear assembly and cannot be operated when 
separated from the complete gear assembly. Typically, an integral 
gearmotor is not manufactured to standard T-frame dimensions specified 
in NEMA MG1. Moreover, neither the motor portion, nor the entire 
integral gearmotor, are capable of being used in most general purpose 
applications without significant modifications. An integral gearmotor is 
also designed for a specific purpose and can have unique performance 
characteristics, physical dimensions, and casing, flange and shafting 
configurations. Consequently, integral gearmotors are outside the scope 
of the EPCA definition of ``electric motor'' and are not covered under 
EPCA.
    However, an ``electric motor,'' as defined by EPCA, which is 
connected to a stand alone mechanical gear drive or an assembly of 
gears, such as a gear reducer connected by direct coupling, belts, 
bolts, a kit, or other means, is covered equipment under EPCA.

      IV. Electric Motors That Are Components in Certain Equipment

    The primary function of an electric motor is to convert electrical 
energy to mechanical energy which then directly drives machinery such as 
pumps, fans, or compressors. Thus, an electric motor is always connected 
to a driven machine or apparatus. Typically the motor is incorporated 
into a finished product such as an air conditioner, a refrigerator, a 
machine tool, food processing equipment, or other commercial or 
industrial machinery. These products are commonly known as ``original 
equipment'' or ``end-use equipment,'' and are manufactured by firms 
known as ``original equipment manufacturers'' (OEMs).
    Many types of motors used in original equipment are covered under 
EPCA. As noted above, EPCA prescribes efficiency standards to be met by 
all covered electric motors manufactured after October 24, 1997, except 
that covered motors which require listing or certification by a 
nationally recognized safety testing laboratory need not meet the 
standards until after October 24, 1999. Thus, for motors that must 
comply after October 24, 1997, once inventories of motors manufactured 
before the deadline have been exhausted, only complying motors would be 
available for purchase and use by OEMs in manufacturing original 
equipment. Any non-complying motors previously included in such 
equipment would no longer be available.
    The physical, and sometimes operational, characteristics of motors 
that meet EPCA efficiency standards normally differ from the 
characteristics of comparable existing motors that do not meet those 
standards. In part because of such differences, the Department is aware 
of two types of situations where strict application of the October 24, 
1997 deadline could temporarily prevent the manufacture of, and remove 
from the marketplace, currently available original equipment.
    One such situation is where an original equipment manufacturer uses 
an electric motor as a component in end-use equipment that requires 
listing or certification by a nationally recognized safety testing 
laboratory, even though the motor itself does not require listing or 
certification. In some of these instances, the file for listing or 
certification specifies the particular motor to be used. No substitution 
could be made for the motor without review and approval of the new motor 
and the entire system by the safety testing laboratory. Consequently, a 
specified motor that does not meet EPCA standards could not be replaced 
by a complying motor without such review and approval.
    This re-listing or re-certification process is subject to 
substantial variation from one piece of original equipment to the next. 
For

[[Page 308]]

some equipment, it could be a simple paperwork transaction between the 
safety listing or certification organization and the OEM, taking 
approximately four to eight weeks to complete. But the process could 
raise more complex system issues involving redesign of the motor or 
piece of equipment, or both, and actual testing to assure that safety 
and performance criteria are met, and could take several months to 
complete. The completion time could also vary depending on the response 
time of the particular safety approval agency. Moreover, in the period 
immediately after October 24, the Department believes wholesale changes 
could occur in equipment lines when OEMs must begin using motors that 
comply with EPCA. These changes are likely to be concentrated in the 
period immediately after EPCA goes into effect on October 24, and if 
many OEMs seek to re-list or re-certify equipment at the same time, 
substantial delays in the review and approval process at the safety 
approval agencies could occur. For these reasons, the Department is 
concerned that certain end-user equipment that requires safety listing 
or certification could become unavailable in the marketplace, because an 
electric motor specifically identified in a listing or certification is 
covered by EPCA and will become unavailable, and the steps have not been 
completed to obtain safety approval of the equipment when manufactured 
with a complying motor.
    Second, a situation could exist where an electric motor covered by 
EPCA is constructed in a T-frame series or T-frame size that is smaller 
(but still standard) than that assigned by NEMA Standards Publication MG 
13-1984 (R1990), sections 1.2 and 1.3, in order to fit into a restricted 
mounting space that is within certain end-use equipment. (Motors in IEC 
metric frame sizes and kilowatt ratings could also be involved in this 
type of situation.) In such cases, the manufacturer of the end-use 
equipment might need to redesign the equipment containing the mounting 
space to accommodate a larger motor that complies with EPCA. These 
circumstances as well could result in certain currently available 
equipment becoming temporarily unavailable in the market, since the 
smaller size motor would become unavailable before the original 
equipment had been re-designed to accommodate the larger, complying 
motor.
    The Department understands that many motor manufacturers and OEMs 
became aware only recently that the electric motors addressed in the 
preceding paragraphs were covered by EPCA. This is largely for the same 
reasons, discussed above, that EPCA coverage of Category II motors was 
only recently recognized. In addition, the Department understands that 
some motor manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers confused 
motors that themselves require safety listing or certification, which 
need not comply until October 25, 1999, with motors that, while not 
subject to such requirements, are included in original equipment that 
requires safety listing or certification. Consequently, motor 
manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers took insufficient 
action to assure that appropriate complying motors would be available 
for the original equipment involved, and that the equipment could 
accommodate such motors. OEMs involved in such situations may often be 
unable to switch to motors that meet EPCA standards in the period 
immediately following October 24. To mitigate any hardship to purchasers 
of the original equipment, the Department intends to refrain from 
enforcing EPCA in certain limited circumstances, under the conditions 
described below.
    Where a particular electric motor is specified in an approved safety 
listing or certification for a piece of original equipment, and the 
motor does not meet the applicable efficiency standard in EPCA, the 
Department's policy will be as follows: For the period of time necessary 
for the OEM to obtain a revised safety listing or certification for that 
piece of equipment, with a motor specified that complies with EPCA, but 
in no event beyond October 24, 1999, the Department would refrain from 
taking enforcement action under EPCA with respect to manufacture of the 
motor for installation in such original equipment. This policy would 
apply only where the motor has been manufactured and specified in the 
approved safety listing or certification prior to October 25, 1997.
    Where a particular electric motor is used in a piece of original 
equipment and manufactured in a smaller than assigned frame size or 
series, and the motor does not meet the applicable efficiency standard 
in EPCA, the Department's policy will be as follows: For the period of 
time necessary for the OEM to re-design the piece of equipment to 
accommodate a motor that complies with EPCA, but in no event beyond 
October 24, 1999, the Department would refrain from enforcing the 
standard with respect to manufacture of the motor for installation in 
such original equipment. This policy would apply only to a model of 
motor that has been manufactured and included in the original equipment 
prior to October 25, 1997.
    To allow the Department to monitor application of the policy set 
forth in the prior two paragraphs, the Department needs to be informed 
as to the motors being manufactured under the policy. Therefore, each 
motor manufacturer and OEM should jointly notify the Department as to 
each motor they will be manufacturing and using, respectively, after 
October 24, 1997, in the belief that it is covered by the policy. The 
notification should set forth: (1) the name of the motor manufacturer, 
and a description of the motor by type, model number, and date of design 
or production; (2) the name of the original

[[Page 309]]

equipment manufacturer, and a description of the application where the 
motor is to be used; (3) the safety listing or safety certification 
organization and the existing listing or certification file or document 
number for which re-listing or re-certification will be requested, if 
applicable; (4) the reason and amount of time required for continued 
production of the motor, with a statement that a substitute electric 
motor that complies with EPCA could not be obtained by an earlier date; 
and (5) the name, address, and telephone number of the person to contact 
for further information. The joint request should be signed by a 
responsible official of each requesting company, and sent to: U.S. 
Department of Energy, Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and 
Renewable Energy, Office of Building Research and Standards, EE-41, 
Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW, Room 1J-018, 
Washington, DC 20585-0121. The Department does not intend to apply this 
policy to any motor for which it does not receive such a notification. 
Moreover, the Department may use the notification, and make further 
inquiries, to be sure motors listed in the notification meet the 
criteria for application of the policy.
    This part of the Policy Statement will not apply to a motor in 
Category II, discussed above in section III. Because up to 24 months is 
contemplated for compliance by Category II motors, the Department 
believes any issues that might warrant a delay of enforcement for such 
motors can be addressed during that time period.

                         V. Further Information

    The Department intends to incorporate this Policy Statement into an 
appendix to its final rule to implement the EPCA provisions that apply 
to motors. Any comments or suggestions with respect to this Policy 
Statement, as well as requests for further information, should be 
addressed to the Director, Office of Building Research and Standards, 
EE-41, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW, 
Washington, DC 20585-0121.

Sec. 431.23  Test procedures for the measurement of energy efficiency.

    For purposes of 10 CFR Part 431 and EPCA, the test procedures for 
measuring the energy efficiency of an electric motor shall be the test 
procedures specified in appendix A to this subpart B.


<R05>
Sec. 431.24  Determination of efficiency.

    When a party determines the energy efficiency of an electric motor 
in order to comply with an obligation imposed on it by or pursuant to 
Part C of Title III of EPCA, 42 U.S.C. 6311-6316, this section applies. 
This section does not apply to enforcement testing conducted pursuant to 
Sec. 431.127.
    (a) Provisions applicable to all electric motors. (1) General 
Requirements. The average full load efficiency of each basic model of 
electric motor must be determined either by testing in accordance with 
Sec. 431.23 of this subpart, or by application of an alternative 
efficiency determination method (AEDM) that meets the requirements of 
paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section, provided, however, that an 
AEDM may be used to determine the average full load efficiency of one or 
more of a manufacturer's basic models only if the average full load 
efficiency of at least five of its other basic models is determined 
through testing.
    (2) Alternative efficiency determination method. An AEDM applied to 
a basic model must be:
    (i) Derived from a mathematical model that represents the mechanical 
and electrical characteristics of that basic model, and
    (ii) Based on engineering or statistical analysis, computer 
simulation or

[[Page 315]]

modeling, or other analytic evaluation of performance data.
    (3) Substantiation of an alternative efficiency determination 
method. Before an AEDM is used, its accuracy and reliability must be 
substantiated as follows:
    (i) The AEDM must be applied to at least five basic models that have 
been tested in accordance with Sec. 431.23 of this subpart, and
    (ii) The predicted total power loss for each such basic model, 
calculated by applying the AEDM, must be within plus or minus ten 
percent of the mean total power loss determined from the testing of that 
basic model.
    (4) Subsequent verification of an AEDM. (i) Each manufacturer shall 
periodically select basic models representative of those to which it has 
applied an AEDM, and for each basic model selected shall either:
    (A) Subject a sample of units to testing in accordance with 
Secs. 431.23 and 431.24(b)(2) by an accredited laboratory that meets the 
requirements of Sec. 431.25,
    (B) Have a certification body recognized under Sec. 431.27 certify 
its nominal full load efficiency, or
    (C) Have an independent state-registered professional engineer, who 
is qualified to perform an evaluation of electric motor efficiency in a 
highly competent manner and who is not an employee of the manufacturer, 
review the manufacturer's representations and certify that the results 
of the AEDM accurately represent the total power loss and nominal full 
load efficiency of the basic model.
    (ii) Each manufacturer that has used an AEDM under this section 
shall have available for inspection by the Department of Energy records 
showing: the method or methods used; the mathematical model, the 
engineering or statistical analysis, computer simulation or modeling, 
and other analytic evaluation of performance data on which the AEDM is 
based; complete test data, product information, and related information 
that the manufacturer has generated or acquired pursuant to 
Secs. 431.24(a)(3) and (a)(4)(i); and the calculations used to determine 
the average full load efficiency and total power losses of each basic 
model to which the AEDM was applied.
    (iii) If requested by the Department, the manufacturer shall conduct 
simulations to predict the performance of particular basic models of 
electric motors specified by the Department, analyses of previous 
simulations conducted by the manufacturer, sample testing of basic 
models selected by the Department, or a combination of the foregoing.
    (5) Use of a certification program or accredited laboratory. (i) A 
manufacturer may have a certification program, that DOE has classified 
as nationally recognized under Sec. 431.27, certify the nominal full 
load efficiency of a basic model of electric motor, and issue a 
certificate of conformity for the motor.
    (ii) For each basic model for which a certification program is not 
used as described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, any testing of 
the motor pursuant to Sec. 431.24(a)(1) through (3) to determine its 
energy efficiency must be carried out in accordance with Sec. 431.24(b), 
in an accredited laboratory that meets the requirements of Sec. 431.25. 
(This includes testing of the basic model, pursuant to 
Sec. 431.24(a)(3)(i), to substantiate an AEDM.)
    (b) Additional testing requirements applicable when a certification 
program is not used. (1) Selection of basic models for testing. (i) 
Basic models must be selected for testing in accordance with the 
following criteria:
    (A) Two of the basic models must be among the five basic models with 
the highest unit volumes of production by the manufacturer in the prior 
year, or during the prior 12 calendar month period beginning in 1997, 
<SUP>1</SUP> whichever is later;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ In identifying these five basic models, any electric motor that 
does not comply with Sec. 431.42, shall be excluded from consideration.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (B) The basic models should be of different horsepowers without 
duplication;
    (C) The basic models should be of different frame number series 
without duplication; and
    (D) Each basic model should be expected to have the lowest nominal 
full load efficiency among the basic models with the same rating 
(``rating'' as used here has the same meaning as it has in the 
definition of ``basic model'').

[[Page 316]]

    (ii) In any instance where it is impossible for a manufacturer to 
select basic models for testing in accordance with all of these 
criteria, the criteria shall be given priority in the order in which 
they are listed. Within the limits imposed by the criteria, basic models 
shall be selected randomly.
    (2) ection of units for testing. For each basic model selected for 
testing,<SUP>2</SUP> a sample of units shall be selected at random and 
tested. The sample shall be comprised of production units of the basic 
model, or units that are representative of such production units. The 
sample size shall be not fewer than five units, except that when fewer 
than five units of a basic model would be produced over a reasonable 
period of time (approximately 180 days), then each unit shall be tested. 
In a test of compliance with a represented average or nominal 
efficiency:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Components of similar design may be substituted without 
requiring additional testing if the represented measures of energy 
consumption continue to satisfy the applicable sampling provision.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) The average full-load efficiency of the sample X which is 
defined by
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR05OC99.003


where X<INF>i</INF> is the measured full-load efficiency of unit i and n 
is the number of units tested, shall satisfy the condition:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR05OC99.004


where RE is the represented nominal full-load efficiency, and
    (ii) The lowest full-load efficiency in the sample X<INF>min</INF>, 
which is defined by
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR05OC99.005


shall satisfy the condition
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR05OC99.006

    (3) Substantiation of an alternative efficiency determination 
method. The basic models tested under Sec. 431.24(a)(3)(i) must be 
selected for testing in accordance with paragraph (b)(1), and units of 
each such basic model must be tested in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) 
by an accredited laboratory that meets the requirements of Sec. 431.25.


<R05>
Sec. 431.25  Testing laboratories.

    (a) Testing pursuant to Sec. 431.24(a)(5)(ii) must be conducted in 
an accredited laboratory for which the accreditation body was:
    (1) The National Institute of Standards and Technology/National 
Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NIST/NVLAP), or
    (2) A laboratory accreditation body having a mutual recognition 
arrangement with NIST/NVLAP, or
    (3) An organization classified by the Department, pursuant to 
section 431.26, as an accreditation body.
    (b) NIST/NVLAP is under the auspices of the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) which is part of the U.S. Department of 
Commerce. NIST/NVLAP accreditation is granted on the basis of 
conformance with criteria published in 15 CFR Part 285, The National 
Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program Procedures and General 
Requirements. NIST Handbook 150-10, August 1995, presents the technical 
requirements of the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program 
for the Efficiency of Electric Motors field of accreditation. This 
handbook supplements NIST Handbook 150, National Voluntary Laboratory 
Accreditation Program Procedures and General Requirements, which 
contains 15 CFR Part 285 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations plus 
all general NIST/NVLAP procedures, criteria, and policies. Changes in 
NIST/NVLAP's criteria, procedures, policies, standards or other bases 
for granting accreditation, occurring subsequent to the initial 
effective date of 10 CFR part 431 shall not apply to accreditation under 
this part unless approved in writing by the Department of Energy. Copies 
of NIST Handbooks 150 and 150-10 and information regarding NIST/NVLAP 
and its Efficiency of Electric Motors Program (EEM) can be obtained from

entity and request that it take appropriate corrective action. The 
Department will give the entity an opportunity to respond. If after 
receiving such response, or no response, the Department believes 
satisfactory correction has not been made, the Department will withdraw 
its recognition from that entity.
    (2) Voluntary withdrawal. An accreditation body or certification 
program may withdraw itself from recognition by the Department by 
advising the Department in writing of such withdrawal. It must also 
advise those that use it (for an accreditation body, the testing 
laboratories, and for a certification organization, the manufacturers) 
of such withdrawal.
    (3) Notice of withdrawal of recognition. The Department will publish 
in the Federal Register a notice of any withdrawal of recognition that 
occurs pursuant to this paragraph (g).

Sec. 431.29  Petitions for waiver, and applications for interim waiver, of test procedure.

    (a) General criteria. (1) Any interested person may submit a 
petition to waive for a particular basic model any requirements of 
Sec. 431.23 of this subpart, upon the grounds that either the basic 
model contains one or more design characteristics which either prevent 
testing of the basic model according to the prescribed test procedures, 
or the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a 
manner so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption 
characteristics as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data.
    (2) Any interested person who has submitted a Petition for Waiver as 
provided in this subpart may also file an Application for Interim Waiver 
of the applicable test procedure requirements.
    (b) Submission, content, and publication. (1) A Petition for Waiver 
must be submitted, in triplicate, to the Assistant Secretary for Energy 
Efficiency and Renewable Energy, United States Department of Energy. 
Each Petition for Waiver shall:
    (i) Identify the particular basic model(s) for which a waiver is 
requested, the design characteristic(s) constituting the grounds for the 
petition, and the specific requirements sought to be waived and shall 
discuss in detail the need for the requested waiver;
    (ii) Identify manufacturers of all other basic models marketed in 
the United States and known to the petitioner to incorporate similar 
design characteristic(s);
    (iii) Include any alternate test procedures known to the petitioner 
to evaluate in a manner representative of the energy consumption 
characteristics of the basic model; and
    (iv) Be signed by the petitioner or by an authorized representative. 
In accordance with the provisions set forth in 10 CFR 1004.11, any 
request for confidential treatment of any information contained in a 
Petition for Waiver or in supporting documentation must be accompanied 
by a copy of the petition, application or supporting documentation from 
which the information claimed to be confidential has been deleted. DOE 
shall publish in the Federal Register the petition and supporting 
documents from which confidential information, as determined by DOE, has 
been deleted in accordance with 10 CFR 1004.11 and shall solicit 
comments, data and information with respect to the determination of the 
petition.
    (2) An Application for Interim Waiver must be submitted in 
triplicate, with the required three copies of the Petition for Waiver, 
to the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, 
U.S. Department of Energy. Each Application for Interim Waiver shall 
reference the Petition for Waiver by identifying the particular basic 
model(s) for which a waiver and temporary exception are being sought. 
Each Application for Interim Waiver shall demonstrate likely success of 
the Petition for Waiver and shall address

[[Page 321]]

what economic hardship and/or competitive disadvantage is likely to 
result absent a favorable determination on the Application for Interim 
Waiver. Each Application for Interim Waiver shall be signed by the 
applicant or by an authorized representative.
    (c) Notification to other manufacturers. (1) Each petitioner, after 
filing a Petition for Waiver with DOE, and after the Petition for Waiver 
has been published in the Federal Register, must, within five working 
days of such publication, notify in writing all known manufacturers of 
domestically marketed units of the same product type (as listed in 
section 340(1) of the Act) and must include in the notice a statement 
that DOE has published in the Federal Register on a certain date the 
Petition for Waiver and supporting documents from which confidential 
information, if any, as determined by DOE, has been deleted in 
accordance with 10 CFR 1004.11. Each petitioner, in complying with the 
requirements of this paragraph, must file with DOE a statement 
certifying the names and addresses of each person to whom a notice of 
the Petition for Waiver has been sent.
    (2) Each applicant for Interim Waiver, whether filing jointly with, 
or subsequent to, a Petition for Waiver with DOE, must concurrently 
notify in writing all known manufacturers of domestically marketed units 
of the same product type (as listed in Section 340(1) of the Act) and 
must include in the notice a copy of the Petition for Waiver and a copy 
of the Application for Interim Waiver. In complying with this section, 
each applicant must in the written notification include a statement that 
the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy will 
receive and consider timely written comments on the Application for 
Interim Waiver. Each applicant, upon filing an Application for Interim 
Waiver, must in complying with the requirements of this paragraph 
certify to DOE that a copy of these documents have been sent to all 
known manufacturers of domestically marked units of the same product 
type (as listed in section 340(1) of the Act). Such certification must 
include the names and addresses of such persons. Each applicant also 
must comply with the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section with 
respect to the petition for waiver.
    (d) Comments; responses to comments. (1) Any person submitting 
written comments to DOE with respect to an Application for Interim 
Waiver must also send a copy of the comments to the applicant.
    (2) Any person submitting written comments to DOE with the respect 
to a Petition for Waiver must also send a copy of such comments to the 
petitioner. In accordance with subparagraph (b)(1) of this section, a 
petitioner may submit a rebuttal statement to the Assistant Secretary 
for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.
    (e) Provisions specific to interim waivers. (1) Disposition of 
application. If administratively feasible, applicant will be notified in 
writing of the disposition of the Application for Interim Waiver within 
15 business days of receipt of the application. Notice of DOE's 
determination on the Application for Interim Waiver must be published in 
the Federal Register.
    (2) Consequences of filing application. The filing of an Application 
for Interim Waiver shall not constitute grounds for noncompliance with 
any requirements of this subpart, until an Interim Waiver has been 
granted.
    (3) Criteria for granting. An Interim Waiver from test procedure 
requirements will be granted by the Assistant Secretary for Energy 
Efficiency and Renewable Energy if it is determined that the applicant 
will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver 
is denied, if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be 
granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines that it would be 
desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a 
determination on the Petition for Waiver.
    (4) Duration. An interim waiver will terminate 180 days after 
issuance or upon the determination on the Petition for Waiver, whichever 
occurs first. An interim waiver may be extended by DOE for 180 days. 
Notice of such extension and/or any modification of the terms or 
duration of the interim waiver shall be published in the Federal 
Register, and shall be based on relevant information contained in the

[[Page 322]]

record and any comments received subsequent to issuance of the interim 
waiver.
    (f) Provisions specific to waivers--(1) Rebuttal by petitioner. 
Following publication of the Petition for Waiver in the Federal 
Register, a petitioner may, within 10 working days of receipt of a copy 
of any comments submitted in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, submit a rebuttal statement to the Assistant Secretary for 
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. A petitioner may rebut more than 
one response in a single rebuttal statement.
    (2) Disposition of petition. The petitioner will be notified in 
writing as soon as practicable of the disposition of each Petition for 
Waiver. The Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable 
Energy will issue a decision on the petition as soon as is practicable 
following receipt and review of the Petition for Waiver and other 
applicable documents, including, but not limited to, comments and 
rebuttal statements.
    (3) Consequence of filing petition. The filing of a Petition for 
Waiver will not constitute grounds for noncompliance with any 
requirements of this subpart, until a waiver or interim waiver has been 
granted.
    (4) Granting of waivers: criteria, conditions, and publication. 
Waivers will be granted by the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency 
and Renewable Energy, if it is determined that the basic model for which 
the waiver was requested contains a design characteristic which either 
prevents testing of the basic model according to the prescribed test 
procedures, or the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic 
model in a manner so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption 
characteristics as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. 
Waivers may be granted subject to conditions, which may include 
adherence to alternate test procedures specified by the Assistant 
Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. The Assistant 
Secretary will promptly publish in the Federal Register notice of each 
waiver granted or denied, and any limiting conditions of each waiver 
granted.
    (g) Revision of regulation. Within one year of the granting of any 
waiver, the Department of Energy will publish in the Federal Register a 
notice of proposed rulemaking to amend its regulations so as to 
eliminate any need for the continuation of such waiver. As soon 
thereafter as practicable, the Department of Energy will publish in the 
Federal Register a final rule. Such waiver will terminate on the 
effective date of such final rule.
    (h) Exhaustion of remedies. In order to exhaust administrative 
remedies, any person aggrieved by an action under this section must file 
an appeal with the DOE's Office of Hearings and Appeals as provided in 
10 CFR Part 1003, subpart C.

    (b) For purposes of determining the required minimum nominal full 
load efficiency of an electric motor that has a horsepower or kilowatt 
rating between two horsepowers or kilowattages listed consecutively in 
paragraph (a) of this section, each such motor shall be deemed to have a 
horsepower or kilowatt rating that is listed in paragraph (a). The 
rating that the motor is deemed to have shall be determined as follows:
    (1) A horsepower at or above the midpoint between the two 
consecutive horsepowers shall be rounded up to the higher of the two 
horsepowers;
    (2) A horsepower below the midpoint between the two consecutive 
horsepowers shall be rounded down to the lower of the two horsepowers, 
or
    (3) A kilowatt rating shall be directly converted from kilowatts to 
horsepower using the formula, 1 kilowatt = (1/0.746) horsepower, without 
calculating beyond three significant decimal places, and the resulting 
horsepower shall be rounded in accordance with subparagraph (b)(1) or 
(b)(2) of this section, whichever applies.
    (c) This section does not apply to definite purpose motors, special 
purpose motors, and those motors exempted by the Secretary.

Sec. 431.43  Preemption of state regulations.

    Any state regulation providing for any energy conservation standard, 
or other requirement with respect to the energy efficiency or energy 
use, of an electric motor that is not identical to a Federal standard in 
effect under this subpart is preempted by that standard, except as 
provided for in sections 345(a) and 327(b) and (c) of the Act.


<R04>
    Subpart D--Petitions To Exempt State Regulation From Preemption; 
           Petitions To Withdraw Exemption of State Regulation


<R05>
Sec. 431.61  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The regulations in this subpart prescribe the procedures to be 
followed in connection with petitions requesting a rule that a State 
regulation prescribing an energy conservation standard or other 
requirement respecting energy use or energy efficiency of a type (or 
class) of covered equipment not be preempted.
    (b) The regulations in this subpart also prescribe the procedures to 
be followed in connection with petitions to withdraw a rule exempting a 
State regulation prescribing an energy conservation standard or other 
requirement respecting energy use or energy efficiency of a type (or 
class) of covered equipment.


<R05>
Sec. 431.62  Prescriptions of a rule.

    (a) Criteria for exemption from preemption. Upon petition by a State 
which has prescribed an energy conservation standard or other 
requirement for a type or class of covered equipment for which a Federal 
energy conservation standard is applicable, the Secretary shall 
prescribe a rule that such standard not be preempted if he/she 
determines that the State has established by a preponderance of evidence 
that such requirement is needed to meet unusual and compelling State or 
local energy interests. For the purposes of this regulation, the term 
``unusual and compelling State or local energy interests'' means 
interests which are substantially different in nature or magnitude from 
those prevailing in the U.S. generally, and are such that when evaluated 
within the context of the State's energy plan and forecast, the costs, 
benefits, burdens, and reliability of energy savings resulting from the 
State regulation make such regulation preferable or necessary when 
measured against the costs, benefits, burdens, and reliability of 
alternative approaches to energy savings or production, including 
reliance on reasonably predictable market-induced improvements in 
efficiency of all equipment subject to the State regulation. The 
Secretary may not prescribe such a rule if he finds that interested 
persons have established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the 
State's regulation will significantly burden manufacturing, marketing, 
distribution, sale or servicing of the covered equipment on

[[Page 325]]

a national basis. In determining whether to make such a finding, the 
Secretary shall evaluate all relevant factors including: The extent to 
which the State regulation will increase manufacturing or distribution 
costs of manufacturers, distributors, and others; the extent to which 
the State regulation will disadvantage smaller manufacturers, 
distributors, or dealers or lessen competition in the sale of the 
covered equipment in the State; the extent to which the State regulation 
would cause a burden to manufacturers to redesign and produce the 
covered equipment type (or class), taking into consideration the extent 
to which the regulation would result in a reduction in the current 
models, or in the projected availability of models, that could be 
shipped on the effective date of the regulation to the State and within 
the U.S., or in the current or projected sales volume of the covered 
equipment type (or class) in the State and the U.S.; and the extent to 
which the State regulation is likely to contribute significantly to a 
proliferation of State commercial and industrial equipment efficiency 
requirements and the cumulative impact such requirements would have. The 
Secretary may not prescribe such a rule if he/she finds that such a rule 
will result in the unavailability in the State of any covered equipment 
(or class) of performance characteristics (including reliability), 
features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same 
as those generally available in the State at the time of the Secretary's 
finding. The failure of some classes (or types) to meet this criterion 
shall not affect the Secretary's determination of whether to prescribe a 
rule for other classes (or types).
    (1) Requirements of petition for exemption from preemption. A 
petition from a State for a rule for exemption from preemption shall 
include the information listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through 
(a)(1)(vi) of this section. A petition for a rule and correspondence 
relating to such petition shall be available for public review except 
for confidential or proprietary information submitted in accordance with 
the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information Regulations set forth 
in 10 CFR Part 1004.
    (i) The name, address, and telephone number of the petitioner;
    (ii) A copy of the State standard for which a rule exempting such 
standard is sought;
    (iii) A copy of the State's energy plan and forecast;
    (iv) Specification of each type or class of covered product for 
which a rule exempting a standard is sought;
    (v) Other information, if any, believed to be pertinent by the 
petitioner; and
    (vi) Such other information as the Secretary may require.
    (b) Criteria for exemption from preemption when energy emergency 
conditions exist within State. Upon petition by a State which has 
prescribed an energy conservation standard or other requirement for a 
type or class of covered equipment for which a Federal energy 
conservation standard is applicable, the Secretary may prescribe a rule, 
effective upon publication in the Federal Register, that such regulation 
not be preempted if he determines that in addition to meeting the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section the State has established 
that: an energy emergency condition exists within the State that 
imperils the health, safety, and welfare of its residents because of the 
inability of the State or utilities within the State to provide adequate 
quantities of gas or electric energy to its residents at less than 
prohibitive costs; and cannot be substantially alleviated by the 
importation of energy or the use of interconnection agreements; and the 
State regulation is necessary to alleviate substantially such condition.
    (1) Requirements of petition for exemption from preemption when 
energy emergency conditions exist within a State. A petition from a 
State for a rule for exemption from preemption when energy emergency 
conditions exist within a State shall include the information listed in 
paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(vi) of this section. A petition 
shall also include the information prescribed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) 
through (b)(1)(iv) of this section, and shall be available for public

[[Page 326]]

review except for confidential or proprietary information submitted in 
accordance with the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information

obtainable upon the exercise of due care.


<R05>
Sec. 431.123  Compliance certification.

    (a) General. Beginning on the compliance date specified in paragraph 
(g) of this section, a manufacturer or private labeler shall not 
distribute in commerce any basic model of an electric motor which is 
subject to an energy efficiency standard set forth in subpart C of this 
part unless it has submitted to the Department a Compliance 
Certification certifying, in accordance with the provisions of this 
section, that the basic model meets the requirements of the applicable 
standard. The representations in the Compliance Certification must be 
based upon the basic model's energy efficiency as determined in 
accordance with the applicable requirements of subpart B of this part. 
This means, in part, that either:
    (1) the representations as to the basic model must be based on use 
of a certification organization, or
    (2) any testing of the basic model on which the representations are 
based must be conducted at an accredited laboratory.
    (b) Required contents. (1) General representations. Each Compliance 
Certification must certify that:
    (i) The nominal full load efficiency for each basic model of 
electric motor distributed is not less than the minimum nominal full 
load efficiency required for that motor by section Sec. 431.42;
    (ii) All required determinations on which the Compliance 
Certification is based were made in compliance with the applicable 
requirements prescribed in subpart B of this part;
    (iii) All information reported in the Compliance Certification is 
true, accurate, and complete; and

[[Page 331]]

    (iv) The manufacturer or private labeler is aware of the penalties 
associated with violations of the Act and the regulations thereunder, 
and of 18 U.S.C. 1001 which prohibits knowingly making false statements 
to the Federal Government.
    (2) Specific data. (i) For each rating of electric motor (as the 
term ``rating'' is defined in the definition of basic model) which a 
manufacturer or private labeler distributes, the Compliance 
Certification must report the nominal full load efficiency, determined 
pursuant to Secs. 431.23 and 431.24, of the least efficient basic model 
within that rating.
    (ii) The Compliance Certification must identify the basic models on 
which actual testing has been performed to meet the requirements of 
section 431.24.
    (iii) The format for a Compliance Certification is set forth in 
appendix A of this subpart.
    (c) Optional contents. In any Compliance Certification, a 
manufacturer or private labeler may at its option request that DOE 
provide it with a unique Compliance Certification number (``CC number'') 
for any brand name, trademark or other label name under which the 
manufacturer or private labeler distributes electric motors covered by 
the Certification. Such a Compliance Certification must also identify 
all other names, if any, under which the manufacturer or private labeler 
distributes electric motors, and to which the request does not apply.
    (d) Signature and submission. A manufacturer or private labeler must 
submit the Compliance Certification either on its own behalf, signed by 
a corporate officer of the company, or through a third party (for 
example, a trade association or other authorized representative) acting 
on its behalf. Where a third party is used, the Compliance Certification 
must identify the official of the manufacturer or private labeler who 
authorized the third party to make representations on the company's 
behalf, and must be signed by a corporate official of the third party. 
The Compliance Certification must be submitted to the Department by 
certified mail, to Department of Energy, Assistant Secretary for Energy 
Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Office of Building Research and 
Standards, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, 
DC 20585-0121.
    (e) New basic models. For electric motors, a Compliance 
Certification must be submitted for a new basic model only if the 
manufacturer or private labeler has not previously submitted to DOE a 
Compliance Certification, that meets the requirements of section 
431.123, for a basic model that has the same rating as the new basic 
model, and that has a lower nominal full load efficiency than the new 
basic model.
    (f) Response to Compliance Certification; Compliance Certification 
Number (CC number). (1) DOE processing of Certification. Promptly upon 
receipt of a Compliance Certification, the Department will determine 
whether the document contains all of the elements required by this 
section, and may, in its discretion, determine whether all or part of 
the information provided in the document is accurate. The Department 
will then advise the submitting party in writing either that the 
Compliance Certification does not satisfy the requirements of this 
section, in which case the document will be returned, or that the 
Compliance Certification satisfies this section. The Department will 
also advise the submitting party of the basis for its determination.
    (2) Issuance of CC number(s). (i) Initial Compliance Certification. 
When DOE advises that the initial Compliance Certification submitted by 
or on behalf of a manufacturer or private labeler is acceptable, either:
    (A) DOE will provide a single unique CC number, ``CC--------,'' to 
the manufacturer or private labeler, and such CC number shall be 
applicable to all electric motors distributed by the manufacturer or 
private labeler, or
    (B) When required by paragraph (f)(3) of this section, DOE will 
provide more than one CC number to the manufacturer or private labeler.
    (ii) Subsequent Compliance Certification. When DOE advises that any 
other Compliance Certification is acceptable, it will provide a unique 
CC number for any brand name, trademark or other name when required by 
paragraph (f)(3) of this section.

[[Page 332]]

    (iii) When DOE declines to provide a CC number as requested by a 
manufacturer or private labeler in accordance with Sec. 431.123(c), DOE 
will advise the requester of the reasons for such refusal.
    (3) Issuance of two or more CC numbers. (i) DOE will provide a 
unique CC number for each brand name, trademark or other label name for 
which a manufacturer or private labeler requests such a number in 
accordance with Sec. 431.123(c), except as follows. DOE will not provide 
a CC number for any brand name, trademark or other label name:
    (A) For which DOE has previously provided a CC number, or
    (B) That duplicates or overlaps with other names under which the 
manufacturer or private labeler sells electric motors.
    (ii) Once DOE has provided a CC number for a particular name, that 
shall be the only CC number applicable to all electric motors 
distributed by the manufacturer or private labeler under that name.
    (iii) If the Compliance Certification in which a manufacturer or 
private labeler requests a CC number is the initial Compliance 
Certification submitted by it or on its behalf, and it distributes 
electric motors not covered by the CC number(s) DOE provides in response 
to the request(s), DOE will also provide a unique CC number that shall 
be applicable to all of these other motors.
    (g) Compliance date. The compliance date for purposes of this 
section is April 30, 2003, or the date that is 120 days after the date 
of publication in the Federal Register of DOE's final determinations on 
petitions for certification program recognition submitted by CSA 
International and Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., whichever is earlier. 
If DOE publishes the final determinations on different dates, the 
compliance certification date for purposes of this section shall be the 
date that is 120 days after the date of publication of the earlier final 
determination.

alternative efficiency determination method) provided by the 
manufacturer and after the manufacturer has been offered the opportunity 
to meet with the Department to verify, as applicable, compliance with 
the applicable efficiency standard, or the accuracy of labeling 
information, or both. In addition, where compliance of a basic model was 
certified based on an AEDM, the Department shall have the discretion to 
pursue the provisions of section 431.24(a)(4)(iii) prior to invoking the 
test notice procedure. A representative designated by the Secretary 
shall be permitted to observe any reverification procedures undertaken 
pursuant to this subpart, and to inspect the results of such 
reverification.
    (2) The test notice will be signed by the Secretary or his/her 
designee. The test notice will be mailed or delivered by the Department 
to the plant manager or other responsible official, as designated by the 
manufacturer.
    (3) The test notice will specify the model or basic model to be 
selected for testing, the method of selecting the test sample, the date 
and time at which testing shall be initiated, the date by which testing 
is scheduled to be completed and the facility at which testing will be 
conducted. The test notice may also provide for situations in which the 
specified basic model is unavailable for testing, and may include 
alternative basic models.
    (4) The Secretary may require in the test notice that the 
manufacturer of an electric motor shall ship at his expense a reasonable 
number of units of a basic model specified in such test notice to a 
testing laboratory designated by the Secretary. The number of units of a 
basic model specified in a test notice shall not exceed twenty (20).
    (5) Within five working days of the time the units are selected, the 
manufacturer shall ship the specified test units of a basic model to the 
testing laboratory.
    (b) Testing laboratory. Whenever the Department conducts enforcement 
testing at a designated laboratory in accordance with a test notice 
under this section, the resulting test data shall constitute official 
test data for that basic model. Such test data will be used by the 
Department to make a determination of compliance or noncompliance if a 
sufficient number of tests have been conducted to satisfy the 
requirements of appendix B of this subpart.
    (c) Sampling. The determination that a manufacturer's basic model 
complies with its labeled efficiency, or the applicable energy 
efficiency standard, shall be based on the testing conducted in 
accordance with the statistical sampling procedures set forth in 
appendix B of this subpart and the test procedures set forth in appendix 
A to subpart B of this part.
    (d) Test unit selection. A Department inspector shall select a 
batch, a batch sample, and test units from the batch sample in 
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph and the conditions 
specified in the test notice.

[[Page 334]]

    (1) The batch may be subdivided by the Department utilizing criteria 
specified in the test notice.
    (2) A batch sample of up to 20 units will then be randomly selected 
from one or more subdivided groups within the batch. The manufacturer 
shall keep on hand all units in the batch sample until such time as the 
basic model is determined to be in compliance or non-compliance.
    (3) Individual test units comprising the test sample shall be 
randomly selected from the batch sample.
    (4) All random selection shall be achieved by sequentially numbering 
all of the units in a batch sample and then using a table of random 
numbers to select the units to be tested.
    (e) Test unit preparation. (1) Prior to and during the testing, a 
test unit selected in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section 
shall not be prepared, modified, or adjusted in any manner unless such 
preparation, modification, or adjustment is allowed by the applicable 
Department of Energy test procedure. One test shall be conducted for 
each test unit in accordance with the applicable test procedures 
prescribed in appendix A to subpart B.
    (2) No quality control, testing, or assembly procedures shall be 
performed on a test unit, or any parts and sub-assemblies thereof, that 
is not performed during the production and assembly of all other units 
included in the basic model.
    (3) A test unit shall be considered defective if such unit is 
inoperative or is found to be in noncompliance due to failure of the 
unit to operate according to the manufacturer's design and operating 
instructions. Defective units, including those damaged due to shipping 
or handling, shall be reported immediately to the Department. The 
Department shall authorize testing of an additional unit on a case-by-
case basis.
    (f) Testing at manufacturer's option. (1) If a manufacturer's basic 
model is determined to be in noncompliance with the applicable energy 
performance standard at the conclusion of Department testing in 
accordance with the sampling plan specified in appendix B of this 
subpart, the manufacturer may request that the Department conduct 
additional testing of the basic model according to procedures set forth 
in appendix B of this subpart.
    (2) All units tested under this paragraph shall be selected and 
tested in accordance with the provisions given in paragraphs (a) through 
(e) of this section.
    (3) The manufacturer shall bear the cost of all testing conducted 
under this paragraph.
    (4) The manufacturer shall cease distribution of the basic model 
tested under the provisions of this paragraph from the time the 
manufacturer elects to exercise the option provided in this paragraph 
until the basic model is determined to be in compliance. The Department 
may seek civil penalties for all units distributed during such period.
    (5) If the additional testing results in a determination of 
compliance, a notice of allowance to resume distribution shall be issued 
by the Department.


<R05>
Sec. 431.128  Cessation of distribution of a basic model.

    (a) In the event that a model is determined non-compliant by the 
Department in accordance with Sec. 431.127 of this part or if a 
manufacturer or private labeler determines a model to be in 
noncompliance, then the manufacturer or private labeler shall:
    (1) Immediately cease distribution in commerce of the basic model.
    (2) Give immediate written notification of the determination of 
noncompliance, to all persons to whom the manufacturer has distributed 
units of the basic model manufactured since the date of the last 
determination of compliance.
    (3) Pursuant to a request made by the Secretary, provide the 
Department within 30 days of the request, records, reports, and other 
documentation pertaining to the acquisition, ordering, storage, 
shipment, or sale of a basic model determined to be in noncompliance.
    (4) The manufacturer may modify the non-compliant basic model in 
such manner as to make it comply with the applicable performance 
standard. Such modified basic model shall then be treated as a new basic 
model and must be certified in accordance with the provisions of this 
subpart; except that in

[[Page 335]]

addition to satisfying all requirements of this subpart, the 
manufacturer shall also maintain records that demonstrate that 
modifications have been made to all units of the new basic model prior 
to distribution in commerce.
    (b) If a basic model is not properly certified in accordance with 
the requirements of this subpart, the Secretary may seek, among other 
remedies, injunctive action to prohibit distribution in commerce of such 
basic model.


<R05>
Sec. 431.129  Subpoena.

    Pursuant to sections 329(a) and 345 of the Act, for purposes of 
carrying out this part, the Secretary or the Secretary's designee, may 
sign and issue subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses 
and the production of relevant books, records, papers, and other 
documents, and administer the oaths. Witnesses summoned under the 
provisions of this section shall be paid the same fees and mileage as 
are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States. In case of 
contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpoena served upon any persons 
subject to this part, the Secretary may seek an order from the District 
Court of the United States for any District in which such person is 
found or resides or transacts business requiring such person to appear 
and give testimony, or to appear and produce documents. Failure to obey 
such order is punishable by such court as a contempt thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 431.130  Remedies.

    If the Department determines that a basic model of a covered 
equipment does not comply with an applicable energy conservation 
standard:
    (a) The Department will notify the manufacturer, private labeler, or 
any other person as required of this finding and of the Secretary's 
intent to seek a judicial order restraining further distribution in 
commerce of such basic model unless the manufacturer, private labeler or 
any other person as required, delivers to the Department within 15 
calendar days a statement, satisfactory to the Department, of the steps 
he will take to ensure that the non-compliant model will no longer be 
distributed in commerce. The Department will monitor the implementation 
of such statement.
    (b) If the manufacturer, private labeler, or any other person as 
required, fails to stop distribution of the non-compliant model, the 
Secretary may seek to restrain such violation in accordance with 
sections 334 and 345 of the Act.
    (c) The Secretary shall determine whether the facts of the case 
warrant the assessment of civil penalties for knowing violations in 
accordance with sections 333 and 345 of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 431.131  Hearings and appeals.

    (a) Pursuant to sections 333(d) and 345 of the Act, before issuing 
an order assessing a civil penalty against any person under this 
section, the Secretary shall provide to such person notice of the 
proposed penalty. Such notice shall inform such person of that person's 
opportunity to elect in writing within 30 days after the date of receipt 
of such notice to have the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section 
(in lieu of those in paragraph (b) of this section) apply with respect 
to such assessment.
    (b)(1) Unless an election is made within 30 calendar days after 
receipt of notice under paragraph (a) of this section to have paragraph 
(c) of this section apply with respect to such penalty, the Secretary 
shall assess the penalty, by order, after a determination of violation 
has been made on the record after an opportunity for an agency hearing 
pursuant to section 554 of title 5, United States Code, before an 
administrative law judge appointed under section 3195 of such title 5. 
Such assessment order shall include the administrative law judge's 
findings and the basis for such assessment.
    (2) Any person against whom a penalty is assessed under this section 
may, within 60 calendar days after the date of the order of the 
Secretary assessing such penalty, institute an action in the United 
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate judicial circuit for 
judicial review of such order in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5, 
United States Code. The court shall have jurisdiction to enter a 
judgment affirming, modifying, or setting aside in whole or in part, the 
order of the Secretary, or the court

[[Page 336]]

may remand the proceeding to the Secretary for such further action as 
the court may direct.
    (c)(1) In the case of any civil penalty with respect to which the 
procedures of this section have been elected, the Secretary shall 
promptly assess such penalty, by order, after the date of the receipt of 
the notice under paragraph (a) of this section of the proposed penalty.
    (2) If the civil penalty has not been paid within 60 calendar days 
after the assessment has been made under paragraph (c)(1) of this

District Court of the United States for an order affirming the 
assessment of the civil penalty. The court shall have authority to 
review de novo the law and the facts involved and shall have 
jurisdiction to enter a judgment enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as 
so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part, such assessment.
    (3) Any election to have this paragraph apply may not be revoked 
except with the consent of the Secretary.
    (d) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty 
after it has become a final and unappealable order under paragraph (b) 
of this section, or after the appropriate District Court has entered 
final judgment in favor of the Secretary under paragraph (c) of this 
section, the Secretary shall institute an action to recover the amount 
of such penalty in any appropriate District Court of the United States. 
In such action, the validity and appropriateness of such final 
assessment order or judgment shall not be subject to review.
    (e)(1) In accordance with the provisions of sections 333(d)(5)(A) 
and 345 of the Act and notwithstanding the provisions of title 28, 
United States Code, or section 502(c) of the Department of Energy 
Organization Act, the Secretary shall be represented by the General 
Counsel of the Department of Energy (or any attorney or attorneys within 
the Department designated by the Secretary) who shall supervise, 
conduct, and argue any civil litigation to which paragraph (c) of this 
section applies including any related collection action under paragraph 
(d) of this section in a court of the United States or in any other 
court, except the Supreme Court of the United States. However, the 
Secretary or the General Counsel shall consult with the Attorney General 
concerning such litigation and the Attorney General shall provide, on 
request, such assistance in the conduct of such litigation as may be

   Appendix B to Subpart G of Part 431--Sampling Plan for Enforcement 
                                 Testing

Step 1. The first sample size (n<INF>1</INF>) must be five or more 
units.
Step 2. Compute the mean (X<INF>1</INF>) of the measured energy 
performance of the n<INF>1</INF> units in the first sample as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR05OC99.013

    where X<INF>i</INF> is the measured full-load efficiency of unit i.
Step 3. Compute the sample standard deviation (S<INF>1</INF>) of the 
measured full-load efficiency of the n<INF>1,</INF> units in the first 
sample as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR05OC99.014

Step 4. Compute the standard error (SE(X<INF>1</INF>)) of the mean full-
load efficiency of the first sample as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR05OC99.015

Step 5. Compute the lower control limit (LCL<INF>1</INF>) for the mean 
of the first sample using RE as the desired mean as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR05OC99.016

where:

    RE is the applicable EPCA nominal full-load efficiency when the test 
is to determine compliance with the applicable statutory standard, or is 
the labeled nominal full-load efficiency when the test is to determine 
compliance with the labeled efficiency value, and
    t is the 2.5th percentile of a t-distribution for a sample size of 
n<INF>1</INF>, which yields a 97.5 percent confidence level for a one-
tailed t-test.
Step 6. Compare the mean of the first sample (X<INF>1</INF>) with the 
lower control limit (LCL<INF>1</INF>) to determine one of the following:

      (i) If the mean of the first sample is below the lower control 
limit, then the basic model is in non-compliance and testing is at an 
end.
      (ii) If the mean is equal to or greater than the lower control 
limit, no final determination of compliance or non-compliance can be 
made; proceed to Step 7.
Step 7. Determine the recommended sample size (n) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR05OC99.017

where S<INF>1</INF>, RE and t have the values used in Steps 3 and 5, 
respectively. The factor
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR05OC99.018

    is based on a 20 percent tolerance in the total power loss at full-
load and fixed output power.

    Given the value of n, determine one of the following:
    (i) If the value of n is less than or equal to n<INF>1</INF> and if 
the mean energy efficiency of the first sample (X<INF>1</INF>) is equal 
to or greater

[[Page 342]]

than the lower control limit (LCL<INF>1</INF>), the basic model is in 
compliance and testing is at an end.
    (ii) If the value of n is greater than n<INF>1</INF>, the basic 
model is in non-compliance. The size of a second sample n<INF>2</INF> is 
determined to be the smallest integer equal to or greater than the 
difference n-n<INF>1</INF>. If the value of n<INF>2</INF> so calculated 
is greater than 20-n<INF>1</INF>, set n<INF>2</INF> equal to 20-
n<INF>1</INF>.

Step 8. Compute the combined mean (X<INF>2</INF>) of the measured energy 
performance of the n<INF>1</INF> and n<INF>2</INF> units of the combined 
first and second samples as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR05OC99.019

Step 9. Compute the standard error (SE(X<INF>2</INF>)) of the mean full-
load efficiency of the n<INF>1</INF> and n<INF>2</INF> units in the 
combined first and second samples as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR05OC99.020

    (Note that S<INF>1</INF> is the value obtained above in Step 3.)

Step 10. Set the lower control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>) to,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR05OC99.021

    where t has the value obtained in Step 5, and compare the combined 
sample mean (X<INF>2</INF>) to the lower control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>) 
to find one of the following:
    (i) If the mean of the combined sample (X<INF>2</INF>) is less than 
the lower control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>), the basic model is in non-
compliance and testing is at an end.
    (ii) If the mean of the combined sample (X<INF>2</INF>) is equal to 
or greater than the lower control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>), the basic 
model is in compliance and testing is at an end.

                       Manufacturer-Option Testing

    If a determination of non-compliance is made in Steps 6, 7 or 10, 
above, the manufacturer may request that additional testing be 
conducted, in accordance with the following procedures.

Step A. The manufacturer requests that an additional number, 
n<INF>3</INF>, of units be tested, with n<INF>3</INF> chosen such that 
n<INF>1</INF> + n<INF>2</INF> + n<INF>3</INF> does not exceed 20.
Step B. Compute the mean full-load efficiency, standard error, and lower 
control limit of the new combined sample in accordance with the 
procedures prescribed in Steps 8, 9, and 10, above.
Step C. Compare the mean performance of the new combined sample to the 
lower control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>) to determine one of the following:
    (a) If the new combined sample mean is equal to or greater than the 
lower control limit, the basic model is in compliance and testing is at 
an end.
    (b) If the new combined sample mean is less than the lower control 
limit and the value of n<INF>1</INF> + n<INF>2</INF> + n<INF>3</INF> is 
less than 20, the manufacturer may request that additional units be 
tested. The total of all units tested may not exceed 20. Steps A, B, and 
C are then repeated.
    (c) Otherwise, the basic model is determined to be in non-
compliance.

Sec. 434.99  Explanation of numbering system for codes.

    (a) For purposes of this part, a derivative of two different 
numbering systems will be used.
    (1) For the purpose of designating a section, the system employed in 
the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) will be employed. The number 
``434'' which signifies part 434 in chapter II of Title 10, Code of 
Federal Regulations, is used as a prefix for all section headings. The 
suffix is a two or three digit section number. For example the lighting 
section of the standards is designated Sec. 434.401.
    (2) Within each section, a numbering system common to many national 
voluntary consensus standards is used. A decimal system is used to 
denote paragraphs and subparagraphs within a section. For example, in 
Sec. 434.401, ``401.2.1'' refers to subsection 401, paragraph 2, 
subparagraph 1.
    (b) The hybrid numbering system is used for two purposes:
    (1) The use of the Code of Federal Regulations' numbering system 
allows the researcher using the CFR easy access to the standards.
    (2) The use of the second system allows the builder, designer, 
architect or engineer easy access because they are familiar to this 
system numbering. This system was chosen because of its commonality 
among the building industry.


<R04>
           Subpart A--Administration and Enforcement--General


<R05>
Sec. 434.100  Purpose.

    The provisions of this part provide minimum standards for energy 
efficiency for the design of new Federal commercial and multi-family

provisions of subsections 401.3.1 through 401.3.5.
    401.3.1  Building Exteriors. The total connected exterior lighting 
power for the building, or a facility containing multiple buildings, 
shall not exceed the total exterior lighting power allowance, which is 
the sum of the individual allowances determined from Table 401.3.1. The 
individual allowances are determined by multiplying the specific area or 
length of each area description times the allowance for that area. 
Exceptions are as follows: Lighting for outdoor manufacturing or 
processing facilities, commercial greenhouses, outdoor athletic 
facilities, public monuments, designated high-risk security areas, 
signs, retail storefronts, exterior enclosed display windows, and

    401.3.1.1  Trade-offs of exterior lighting budgets among exterior 
areas shall be allowed provided the total connected lighting power of 
the exterior area does not exceed the exterior lighting power allowance. 
Trade-offs between interior lighting power allowances and exterior 
lighting power allowances shall not be allowed.
    401.3.2  Building interiors. The total connected interior lighting 
power for a building, including adjustments in accordance with 
subsection 401.3.3, shall not exceed the total interior lighting power 
allowance explained in this paragraph. Using Table 401.3.2a, multiply 
the interior lighting power allowance value by the gross lighted area of 
the most appropriate building or space activity. For multi-use 
buildings, using Table 401.3.2a, select the interior power allowance 
value for each activity using the column for the gross lighted area of 
the whole building and multiply it by the associated gross area for that 
activity. The interior lighting power allowance is the sum of all the 
wattages for each area/activity. Using Table 401.3.2b, c, or d, multiply 
the interior lighting power allowance values of each individual area/
activity by the area of the space and by the area factor from Figure 
401.3.2e, based on the most appropriate area/activity provided. The 
interior lighting power allowance is the sum of the wattages for each 
individual space. When over 20% of the building's tasks or interior 
areas are undefined, the most appropriate value for that building from 
Table 401.3.2a shall be used for the undefined spaces. Exceptions are as 
follows:
    (a) Lighting power that is an essential technical element for the 
function performed in theatrical, stage, broadcasting, and similar uses.
    (b) Specialized medical, dental, and research lighting.
    (c) Display lighting for exhibits in galleries, museums, and 
monuments.
    (d) Lighting solely for indoor plant growth (between the hours of 
10:00 pm and 6:00 am).
    (e) Emergency lighting that is automatically off during normal 
building operation.
    (f) High-risk security areas.

[[Page 359]]

    (g) Spaces specifically designed for the primary use by the 
physically impaired or aged.
    (h) Lighting in dwelling units.
    401.3.2.1  Trade-offs of the interior lighting power budgets among 
interior spaces shall be allowed provided the total connected lighting 
power within the building does not exceed the interior lighting power 
allowance. Trade-offs between interior lighting power allowances and 
exterior lighting power allowances shall not be allowed.
    401.3.2.2  Building/Space Activities. Definitions of buildings/space 
activity as they apply to Table 401.3.2a are as follows. These 
definitions are necessary to characterize the activities for which 
lighting is provided. They are applicable only to Table 401.3.2a. They 
are not intended to be used elsewhere in place of building use group 
definitions provided in the Building Code. They are not included in 
Sec. 434.201, ``Definitions,'' to avoid confusion with ``Occupancy Type 
Categories.''

    401.3.3  Lighting Power Control Credits. The interior connected 
lighting power determined in accordance with Sec. 434.401.3.2 can be 
decreased for luminaries that are automatically controlled for 
occupancy, daylight, lumen maintenance, or programmable timing. The 
adjusted interior connected lighting power shall be determined by 
subtracting the sum of all lighting power control credits from the 
interior connected lighting power. Using Table 401.3.3, the lighting 
power control credit equals the power adjustment factor times the 
connected lighting power of the controlled lighting. The lighting power 
adjustment shall be applied with the following limitations:
    (a) It is limited to the specific area controlled by the automatic 
control device.
    (b) Only one lighting power adjustment may be used for each building 
space or luminaire, and 50 percent or more of the controlled luminaire 
shall be within the applicable space.
    (c) Controls shall be installed in series with the lights and in 
series with all manual switching devices.
    (d) When sufficient daylight is available, daylight sensing controls 
shall be capable of reducing electrical power consumption for lighting 
(continuously or in steps) to 50 percent or less of maximum power 
consumption.
    (e) Daylight sensing controls shall control all luminaires to which 
the adjustment is applied and that direct a minimum of 50 percent of 
their light output into the daylight zone.
    (f) Programmable timing controls shall be able to program different 
schedules for occupied and unoccupied days, be readily accessible for 
temporary override with automatic return to the original schedule, and 
keep time during power outages for at least four hours.

434.402  Building envelope assemblies and materials.

    The building envelope and its associated assemblies and materials 
shall meet the provisions of this section.
    402.1  Calculations and Supporting Information.
    402.1.1  Material Properties. Information on thermal properties, 
building envelope system performance, and component heat transfer shall 
be obtained from RS-4. When the information is not available from RS-4, 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 434.701) the data shall be obtained 
from manufacturer's information or laboratory or field test measurements 
using RS-5, RS-6, RS-7, or RS-8 (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 434.701).
    402.1.1.1  The shading coefficient (SC) for fenestration shall be 
obtained from RS-4 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 434.701) or from 
manufacturer's test data. The shading coefficient of the fenestration, 
including both internal and external shading devices, is SC<INF>X</INF> 
and excludes the effect of external shading projections, which are 
calculated separately. The shading coefficient used for louvered shade 
screens shall be determined using a profile angle of 30 degrees as found 
in Table 41, Chapter 27 of RS-4 (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 434.701).
    402.1.2  Thermal Performance Calculations. The overall thermal 
transmittance of the building envelope shall be calculated in accordance 
with Equation 402.1.2:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.022

Where:

U<INF>o</INF> = the area-weighted average thermal transmittance of the 
gross area of the building envelope; i.e., the exterior wall assembly 
including fenestration and doors, the roof and ceiling assembly, and the 
floor assembly, Btu/(h<bullet>ft\2\[middot] deg.F)
A<INF>o</INF> = the gross area of the building envelope, ft\2\
U<INF>i</INF> = the thermal transmittance of each individual path of the 
building envelope, i.e., the opaque portion or the fenestration, Btu/
(h[middot]ft\2\[middot] deg.F)
U<INF>i</INF> = 1/R<INF>i</INF> (where R<INF>i</INF> is the total 
resistance to heat flow of an individual path through the building 
envelope)
A<INF>i</INF> = the area of each individual element of the building 
envelope, ft\2\

    The thermal transmittance of each component of the building envelope 
shall be determined with due consideration of all major series and 
parallel heat flow paths through the elements of the component and film 
coefficients and shall account for any compression of insulation. The 
thermal transmittance of opaque elements of assemblies shall be 
determined using a series path procedure with corrections for the 
presence of parallel paths within an element of the envelope assembly 
(such as wall cavities with parallel paths through insulation and 
studs). The thermal performance of adjacent ground in below-grade 
applications shall be excluded from all thermal calculations.
    402.1.2.1  Envelope Assemblies Containing Metal Framing. The thermal 
transmittance of the envelope assembly containing metal framing shall be 
determined from one of three methods:
    (a) Laboratory or field test measurements based on RS-5, RS-6, RS-7, 
or RS-8 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 434.701).
    (b) The zone method described in Chapter 22 of RS-4 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 434.701) and the formulas on page 22.10.
    (c) For metal roof trusses or metal studs covered by Tables 
402.1.2.1a and b, the total resistance of the series path shall be 
calculated in accordance with the following Equations:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.023

Where:

R<INF>t</INF> = the total resistance of the envelope assembly
R<INF>i</INF> = the resistance of the series elements (for i = 1 to n) 
excluding the parallel path element(s)

[[Page 366]]

R<INF>e</INF> = the equivalent resistance of the element containing the 
parallel path (R-value of insulation x F<INF>c</INF>). Values for 
F<INF>c</INF> and equivalent resistances shall be taken from Tables 
402.1.2.1a or b.

components.
    (a) The following equation 402.1.2.4a shall be used.

[[Page 367]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.024

Where:

U<INF>of</INF> = the overall thermal transmittance of the fenestration 
assemblies, including the center-of-glass, edge-of-glass, and frame 
components, Btu/(h[middot]ft<SUP>2</SUP>[middot] deg.F)

envelope systems to assess the potential for condensation within the 
envelope and to determine the position of the vapor retarder within the 
envelope system.
    (b) The vapor retarder shall be installed over the entire building 
envelope.
    (c) The perm rating requirements of the vapor retarder shall be 
determined using the methodologies contained in Chapter 20 of RS-4, 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 434.701) and shall take into 
account local climate and indoor humidity level. The vapor retarder 
shall have a performance rating of 1 perm or less.
    402.3  Thermal Performance Criteria.
    402.3.1  Roofs; Floors and Walls Adjacent to Unconditioned Spaces. 
The area weighted average thermal transmittance of roofs and also of 
floors and walls adjacent to unconditioned spaces shall not exceed the 
criteria in Table 402.3.1a. Exceptions are as follows: Skylights for 
which daylight credit is taken may be excluded from the calculations of 
the roof assembly U<INF>or</INF> if all of the following conditions are 
met:
    (a) The opaque roof thermal transmittance is less than the criteria 
in Table 402.3.1b.
    (b) Skylight areas, including framing, as a percentage of the roof 
area do not exceed the values specified in Table 402.3.1b. The maximum 
skylight area from Table 402.3.1b may be increased by 50% if a shading 
device is used that blocks over 50% of the solar gain during the peak 
cooling design condition. For shell buildings, the permitted skylight 
area shall be based on a light level of 30 foot candles and a lighting 
power density (LPD) of less than 1.0 w/ft \2\. For speculative 
buildings, the permitted skylight area shall be based on

[[Page 370]]

the unit lighting power allowance from Table 401.3.2a and an illuminance 
level as follows: for LPD < 1.0, use 30 footcandles; for 1.0 < LPD < 
2.5, use 50 footcandles; and for LPD [ge] 2.5, use 70 footcandles.
    (c) All electric lighting fixtures within daylighted zones under 
skylights are controlled by automatic daylighting controls.
    (d) The U<INF>o</INF> of the skylight assembly including framing 
does not exceed------------Btu/(h<bullet>ft \2\<bullet> deg.F) [Use 0.70 
for [le] 8000 HDD65 and 0.45 for <ls-thn-eq>8000 HDD65 or both if the 
jurisdiction includes cities that are both below and above 8000 HDD65.]
    (e) Skylight curb U-value does not exceed 0.21 Btu/(h<bullet>ft 
\2\<bullet> deg.F).
    (f) The infiltration coefficient of the skylights does not exceed 
0.05 cfm/ft \2\.
    402.3.2  Below-Grade Walls and Slabs-on-Grade. The thermal 
resistance (R-value) of insulation for slabs-on-grade, or the overall 
thermal resistance of walls in contact with the earth, shall be equal to 
or greater than the values in Table 402.3.2.
    402.4  Exterior Walls. Exterior walls shall comply with either 
402.4.1 or 402.4.2.
    402.4.1  Prescriptive Criteria. (a) The exterior wall shall be 
designed in accordance with subsections 402.4.1.1 and 402.4.1.2. When 
the internal load density range is not known, the 0-1.50 W/ft \2\ range 
shall be used for residential, hotel/motel guest rooms, or warehouse 
occupancies; the 3.01-3.50 w/ft \2\ range shall be used for retail 
stores smaller than 2,000 ft \2\ and technical and vocational schools 
smaller than 10,000 ft \2\; and the 1.51-3.00 W/ft \2\ range shall be 
used for all other occupancies and building sizes. When the building 
envelope is designed or constructed prior to knowing the building 
occupancy type, an internal load density of ------ W/ft \2\ shall be 
used. [Use 3.0 W/ft \2\ for HDD65 <3000, 2.25 W/ft \2\ for 3000 < HDD65 
< 6000, and 1.5 W/ft \2\ for HDD65 <ls-thn-eq> 6000.]
    (b) When more than one condition exists, area weighted averages 
shall be used. This requirement shall apply to all thermal 
transmittances, shading coefficients, projection factors, and internal 
load densities rounded to the same number of decimal places as shown in 
the respective table.
    402.4.1.1  Opaque Walls. The weighted average thermal transmittance 
(U-value) of opaque wall elements shall be less than the values in Table 
402.4.1.1. For mass walls (HC [ge] 5), criteria are presented for low 
and high window/wall ratios and the criteria shall be determined by 
interpolating between these values for the window/wall ratio of the 
building.
    402.4.1.2  Fenestration. The design of the fenestration shall meet 
the criteria of Table 402.4.1.2. When the fenestration columns labeled 
``Perimeter Daylighting'' are used, automatic daylighting controls shall 
be installed in the perimeter daylighted zones of the building. These 
daylighting controls shall be capable of reducing electric lighting 
power to at least 50% of full power. Only those shading or lighting 
controls for perimeter daylighting that are shown on the plans shall be 
considered. The column labeled ``VLT <ls-thn-eq> = SC'' shall be used 
only when the shading coefficient of the glass is less than its visible 
light transmittance.

    403.2.3  Separate Air Distribution System. Zones with special 
process temperature and/or humidity requirements shall be served by air 
distribution systems separate from those serving zones requiring only 
comfort conditions or shall include supplementary provisions so that the 
primary systems may be specifically controlled for comfort purposes 
only. Exceptions: Zones requiring only comfort heating or comfort 
cooling that are served by a system primarily used for process 
temperature and humidity control need not be served by a separate system 
if the total supply air to these comfort zones is no more than 25% of 
the total system supply air or the total conditioned floor area of the 
zones is less than 1000 ft2.
    403.2.4  Ventilation and Fan System Design. Ventilation systems 
shall be designed to be capable of reducing the supply of outdoor air to 
the minimum ventilation rates required by Section 6.1.3 of RS-41 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 434.701) through the use of return

controls, or other devices. Exceptions are as follows: Minimum outdoor 
air rates may be greater if:
    (a) Required to make up air exhausted for source control of 
contaminants such as in a fume hood.

periods. Outside air shall not be reduced below 0.14 cfm/ft\2\. Outside 
air intake shall be controlled by one or more of the following:
    (a) A clearly labeled, readily accessible bypass timer that may be 
used by occupants or operating personnel to temporarily increase minimum 
outside air flow up to design levels.
    (b) A carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>) control system having sensors 
located in the spaces served, or in the return air from the spaces 
served, capable of maintaining space CO<INF>2</INF> concentrations below 
levels recommended by the manufacturer, but no fewer than one sensor per 
25,000 ft\2\ of occupied space shall be provided.

follows: Independent perimeter systems that are designed to offset 
building envelope heat losses or gains or both may serve one or more 
zones also served by an interior system when the perimeter system 
includes at least one thermostatic control zone for each building 
exposure having exterior walls facing only one orientation for at least 
50 contiguous ft and the perimeter system heating and cooling supply is 
controlled by thermostat(s) located within the zone(s) served by the

    (a) Variable-air-volume systems that, during periods of occupancy, 
are designed to reduce the air supply to each zone to a minimum before 
heating, recooling, or mixing takes place. This minimum volume shall be 
no greater than the larger of 30% of the peak supply volume, the minimum 
required to meet minimum ventilation requirements of the Federal agency. 
(0.4 cfm/ft\2\ of zone conditioned floor area, and 300 cfm).
    (b) Zones where special pressurization relationships or cross-
contamination requirements are such that variable-air-volume systems are 
impractical, such as isolation rooms, operating areas of hospitals and 
clean rooms.

expected to operate nonsimultaneously for more than 750 hours per year 
shall include isolation devices and controls to shut off or set back the 
supply of heating and cooling to each zone independently. Isolation is 
not required for zones expected to operate continuously or expected to 
be inoperative only when all other zones are inoperative. For buildings 
where occupancy patterns are not known at the time of system design, 
such as speculative buildings, the designer may predesignate isolation 
areas. The grouping of zones on one floor into a single isolation area 
shall

[[Page 379]]

be permitted when the total conditioned floor area does not exceed

humidification, dehumidification, and supermarket refrigeration systems, 
so as to increase overall energy usage.
    (d) Systems that serve envelope-dominated spaces whose sensible 
cooling load at design conditions, excluding transmission and

is required simultaneously.
    (b) Systems in climates with less than 750 average operating hours 
per year between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. when the ambient dry-bulb 
temperatures are between 55  deg.F and 69  deg.F inclusive.

require that all HVAC systems be balanced in accordance with the 
industry accepted procedures (such as National Environmental Balancing 
Bureau (NEBB) Procedural Standards, Associated Air Balance Council 
(AABC) National Standards, or ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 111). Air and water 
flow rates shall be measured and adjusted to deliver final flow rates 
within 10% of design rates, except variable flow distribution systems 
need not be balanced upstream of the controlling device (VAV box or 
control valve).
    403.2.10.3.1  Construction documents shall require a written balance 
report be provided to the Federal agency for HVAC systems serving zones 
with a total conditioned area exceeding 5,000 ft<SUP>2</SUP>.
    403.2.10.3.2  Air systems shall be balanced in a manner to first 
minimize throttling losses, then fan speed shall be adjusted to meet 
design flow conditions or equivalent procedures. Exceptions are as 
follows: Damper throttling may be used for air system balancing;
    (a) With fan motors of 1 hp (0.746 kW) or less, or
    (b) Of throttling results in no greater than \1/3\ hp (0.248 kW) fan 
horsepower draw above that required if the fan speed were adjusted.
    403.2.10.4 Hydronic System Balancing. Hydronic systems shall be 
balanced in a manner to first minimize throttling losses; then the pump 
impeller shall be trimmed or pump speed shall be adjusted to meet design 
flow conditions. Exceptions are as follows:

[[Page 382]]

    (a) Pumps with pump motors of 10 hp (7.46 kW) or less.
    (b) If throttling results in no greater than 3 hp (2.23 kW) pump 
horsepower draw above that required if the impeller were trimmed.
    (c) To reserve additional pump pressure capability in open circuit 
piping systems subject to fouling. Valve throttling pressure drop shall 
not exceed that expected for future fouling.
    403.2.10.5  Control System Testing. HVAC control systems shall be 
tested to assure that control elements are calibrated, adjusted, and in 
proper working condition. For projects larger than 50,000 ft2 
conditioned area, detailed instructions for commissioning HVAC systems 
shall be provided by the designer in plans and specifications.

satisfy the minimum performance efficiency specified in Table 404.1 when 
tested in accordance with RS-37, RS-38, or RS-39 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 434.701). Omission of equipment from Table 404.1 
shall not preclude the use of such equipment. Service water heating 
equipment used to provide additional function of space heating as part 
of a combination (integrated) system shall satisfy all stated 
requirements for the service water heating equipment. All gas-fired 
storage water heaters that are not equipped with a flue damper and use 
indoor air for combustion or draft hood dilution and that are installed 
in a conditioned space, shall be equipped with a vent damper listed in 
accordance with RS-42 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 434.701). 
Unless the water heater has an available electrical supply, the 
installation of such a vent damper shall not require an electrical 
connection.

    404.1.1  Testing Electric and Oil Storage Water Heaters for Standby 
Loss.
    (a) When testing an electric storage water heater, the procedures of 
Z21.10.3-1990 (RS-39, incorporated by reference, see Sec. 434.701), 
Section 2.9, shall be used. The electrical supply voltage shall be 
maintained with <plus-minus>1% of the center of the voltage range 
specified on the water heater nameplate. Also, when needed for 
calculations, the thermal efficiency (E<INF>t</INF>) shall be 98%. When 
testing an oil-fired water heater, the procedures of Z21.10.3-1990 (RS-
39 incorporated by reference, see Sec. 434.701), Sections 2.8 and 2.9, 
shall be used.
    (b) The following modifications shall be made: A vertical length of 
flue pipe shall be connected to the flue gas outlet of sufficient height 
to establish the minimum draft specified in the manufacturer's 
installation instructions. All measurements of oil consumption shall be 
taken by instruments with an accuracy of <plus-minus>1% or better. The 
burner rate shall be adjusted to achieve an hourly Btu input rate within 
<plus-minus>2% of the manufacturer's specified input rate with the 
CO<INF>2</INF> reading as specified by the manufacturer with smoke no 
greater than 1 and the fuel pump pressure within <plus-minus>1% of the 
manufacturer's specification.
    404.1.2  Unfired Storage Tanks. The heat loss of the tank surface 
area Btu/(h[middot]ft\2\) shall be based on an 80 deg.F water-air 
temperature difference.
    404.1.3  Storage Volume Symbols in Table 404.1. The symbol ``V'' is 
the rated storage volume in gallons as specified by the manufacturer. 
The symbol ``V<INF>T</INF>'' is the storage volume in gallons as 
measured during the test to determine the standby loss. V<INF>T</INF> 
may differ from V, but it is within tolerances allowed by the applicable 
Z21 and Underwriters Laboratories standards. Accordingly, for the 
purpose of estimating the standby loss requirement using the rated 
volume shown on the rating plate, V<INF>T</INF> should be considered as 
no less than 0.95V for gas and oil water heaters and no less than 0.90V 
for electric water heaters.
    404.1.4  Electric Water Heaters. In applications where water 
temperatures not greater than 145 deg.F are required, an economic 
evaluation shall be made on the potential benefit of using an electric 
heat pump water heater(s) instead of an electric resistance water 
heater(s). The analysis shall compare the extra installed costs of the 
heat pump unit with the benefits in reduced energy costs (less increased 
maintenance costs) over the estimated service life of the heat pump 
water heater. Exceptions are as follows: Electric water heaters used in 
conjunction with site-recovered or site-solar energy sources that 
provide 50% or more of the water heating load or off-peak heating with 
thermal storage.
    404.2  Service Hot Water Piping Insulation. Circulating system 
piping and noncirculating systems without heat traps, the first eight 
feet of outlet piping from a constant-temperature noncirculating storage 
system, and the inlet pipe between the storage tank and a heat trap in a 
noncirculating storage system shall meet the provisions of subsection 
403.2.9.
    404.2.1  Vertical risers serving storage water heaters not having an 
integral heat trap and serving a noncirculating system shall have heat 
traps on both the inlet and outlet piping as close as practical to the 
water heater.
    404.3  Service Water Heating System Controls. Temperature controls 
that allow for storage temperature adjustment from 110 deg.F to a 
temperature compatible with the intended use shall be provided in 
systems serving residential dwelling units and from 90 deg.F for other 
systems. When designed to maintain usage temperatures in hot water 
pipes, such as circulating hot water systems or heat trace, the system 
shall be equipped with automatic time switches or other controls that 
can be set to turn off the system.
    404.3.1  The outlet temperature of lavatory faucets in public 
facility restrooms shall be limited to 110 deg.F.
    404.4  Water Conservation. Showerheads and lavatory faucets must 
meet the requirements of 10 CFR 430.32 (o)-(p).
    404.4.1  Lavatory faucets in public facility restrooms shall be 
equipped with a foot switch, occupancy sensor, or similar device or, in 
other than lavatories for physically handicapped persons, limit water 
delivery to 0.25 gal/cycle.

[[Page 385]]

    404.5  Swimming Pools. All pool heaters shall be equipped with a 
readily accessible on-off switch.
    404.5.1  Time switches shall be installed on electric heaters and 
pumps. Exceptions are as follows:
    (a) Pumps required to operate solar or heat recovery pool heating 
systems.
    (b) Where public health requirements require 24-hour pump operation.
    404.5.2  Heated swimming pools shall be equipped with pool covers. 
Exception: When over 70% of the annual energy for heating is obtained 
from a site-recovered or site-solar energy source.
    404.6  Combined Service Water Heating and Space Heating Equipment. A 
single piece of equipment shall not be used to provide both space 
heating and service water heating. Exceptions are as follows:
    (a) The energy input or storage volume of the combined boiler or 
water heater is less than twice the energy input or storage volume of 
the smaller of the separate boilers or water heaters otherwise required 
or
    (b) The input to the combined boiler is less than 150,000 Btuh.

         Subpart E--Building Energy Cost Compliance Alternative


<R05>
Sec. 434.501  General.

    501.1  Subpart E permits the use of the Building Energy Cost 
Compliance Alternative as an alternative to many elements of subpart D. 
When this subpart is used, it must be used with subpart C and subpart D, 
401.1, 401.2, 401.3.4 and in conjunction with the minimum requirements 
found in subsections 402.1, 402.2, and 402.3., 403.1, 403.2.1-7, 403.2.9 
and 404.
    501.2  Compliance. Compliance under this method requires detailed 
energy analyses of the entire Proposed Design, referred to as the Design 
Energy Consumption; an estimate of annual energy cost for the proposed 
design, referred to as the Design Energy Cost; and comparison against an 
Energy Cost Budget. Compliance is achieved when the estimated Design 
Energy Cost is less than or equal to the Energy Cost Budget. This 
subpart provides instructions for determining the Energy Cost Budget and 
for calculating the Design Energy Consumption and Design Energy Cost. 
The Energy Cost Budget shall be determined through the calculation of 
monthly energy consumption and energy cost of a Prototype or Reference 
Building design configured to meet the requirements of subsections 401 
through 404.
    501.3  Designers are encouraged to employ the Building Energy Cost 
Budget compliance method set forth in this section for evaluating 
proposed design alternatives to using the elements prescribed in subpart 
D. The Building Energy Cost Budget establishes the relative 
effectiveness of each design alternative in energy cost savings, 
providing an energy cost basis upon which the building owner and 
designer may select one design over another. This Energy Cost Budget is 
the highest allowable calculated energy cost for a specific building 
design. Other alternative designs are likely to have lower annual energy 
costs and life cycle costs than those used to minimally meet the Energy 
Cost Budget.
    501.4  The Energy Cost Budget is a numerical reference for annual 
energy cost. It's purpose is to assure neutrality with respect to 
choices such as HVAC system type, architectural design and fuel choice 
by providing a fixed, repeatable budget that is independent of any of 
these choices wherever possible (i.e., for the prototype buildings). The 
Energy Cost Budget for a given building size and type will vary only 
with climate, the number of stories, and the choice of simulation tool. 
The specifications of the prototypes are necessary to assure 
repeatability, but have no other significance. They are not necessarily 
recommended energy conserving practice, or even physically reasonable 
practice for some climates or buildings, but represent a reasonable 
worst case of energy cost resulting from compliance with the provisions 
of subsections 401 through 404.


<R05>
Sec. 434.502  Determination of the annual energy cost budget.

    502.1  The annual Energy Cost Budgets shall be determined in 
accordance with the Prototype Building Procedure in Sec. 434.503 and 
Sec. 434.504 or the Reference Building Procedure in Sec. 434.505. Both 
methods calculate an annual Energy

[[Page 386]]

Cost by summing the 12 monthly Energy Cost Budgets. Each monthly Energy 
Cost Budget is the product of the monthly Building Energy Consumption of 
each type of energy used multiplied by the monthly Energy Cost per unit 
of energy for each type of energy used.
    502.2  The Energy Cost Budget shall be determined in accordance with 
Equation 502.2.a as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.025


Based on:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.026

Where:

ECB = The annual Energy Cost Budget
ECB<INF>m</INF> = The monthly Energy Cost Budget
BECON<INF>mi</INF> = The monthly Budget Energy Consumption of the 
i<INF>th</INF> type of energy
ECOS<INF>mi</INF> = The monthly Energy Cost, per unit of the 
i<INF>th</INF> type of energy

    502.3  The monthly Energy Cost Budget shall be determined using 
current rate schedules or contract prices available at the building site 
for all types of energy purchased. These costs shall include demand 
charges, rate blocks, time of use rates, interruptible service rates, 
delivery charges, taxes, and all other applicable rates for the type, 
location, operation, and size of the proposed design. The monthly Budget 
Energy Consumption shall be calculated from the first day through the 
last day of each month, inclusive.


<R05>
Sec. 434.503  Prototype building procedure.

    503.1  The Prototype Building procedure shall be used for all 
building types listed below. For mixed-use buildings the Energy Cost 
Budget is derived by allocating the floor space of each building type 
within the floor space of the prototype building. For buildings not 
listed below, the Reference Building procedure of Sec. 434.505 shall be 
used. Prototype buildings include:
    (a) Assembly;
    (b) Office (Business);
    (c) Retail (Mercantile);
    (d) Warehouse (Storage);
    (e) School (Educational);
    (f) Hotel/Motel;
    (g) Restaurant;
    (h) Health/Institutional; and
    (i) Multi-Family.


<R05>
Sec. 434.504  Use of the prototype building to determine the energy cost budget.

    504.1  Determine the building type of the Proposed Design using the 
categories in subsection 503.1. Using the appropriate Prototype Building 
characteristics from all of the tables contained in Subpart E, the 
building shall be simulated using the same gross floor area and number 
of floors for the Prototype Building as in the Proposed Design.
    504.2  The form, orientation, occupancy and use profiles for the 
Prototype Building shall be fixed as described in subsection 511. 
Envelope, lighting, other internal loads and HVAC systems and equipment 
shall meet the requirements of subsection 301, 401, 402, 403, and 404 
and are standardized inputs.


<R05>
Sec. 434.505  Reference building method.

    505.1  The Reference Building procedure shall be used only when the 
Proposed Design cannot be represented by one or a combination of the 
Prototype Building listed in subsection 503.1 or the assumptions for the 
Prototype Building in Subsection 510, such as occupancy and use-
profiles, do not reasonably represent the Proposed Design.


<R05>
Sec. 434.506  Use of the reference building to determine the energy cost budget.

    506.1  Each floor shall be oriented in the same manner for the 
Reference

[[Page 387]]

Building as in the Proposed Design. The form, gross and conditioned 
floor areas of each floor and the number of floors shall be the same as 
in the Proposed Design. All other characteristics, such as lighting, 
envelope and HVAC systems and equipment, shall meet the requirements of 
subsections 301, 401, 402, 403 and 404.


<R05>
Sec. 434.507  Calculation procedure and simulation tool.

    507.1  The Prototype or Reference Buildings shall be modeled using 
the criteria of subsections 510 and 521. The modeling shall use a 
climate data set appropriate for both the site and the complexity of the 
energy conserving features of the design. ASHRAE Weather Year for Energy 
Calculations (WYEC) data or bin weather data shall be used in the 
absence of other appropriate data.


<R05>
Sec. 434.508  Determination of the design energy consumption and design energy cost.

    508.1  The Design Energy Consumption shall be calculated by modeling 
the Proposed Design using the same methods, assumptions, climate data, 
and simulation tool as were used to establish the Energy Cost Budget, 
except as explicitly stated in 509 through 534. The Design Energy Cost 
shall be calculated per Equation 508.1.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.027


Based on:

                    DECOS<INF>m</INF> = DECON<INF>ml</INF> x 
ECOS<INF>ml</INF> +. . .+ DECON<INF>mi</INF> x ECOS<INF>mi</INF>      
(Equation 508.1.2)

Where:
DECOS = The annual Design Energy Cost
DECOS<INF>m</INF> = The monthly Design Energy Cost
DECON<INF>mi</INF> = The monthly Design Energy Consumption of the 
i<INF>th</INF> type of energy
ECOS<INF>mi</INF> = The monthly Energy Cost per unit of the 
i<INF>th</INF> type of energy

    The DECON<INF>mi</INF> shall be calculated from the first day 
through the last day of the month, inclusive.


<R05>
Sec. 434.509  Compliance.

    509.1  If the Design Energy Cost is less than or equal to the Energy 
Cost Budget, and all of the minimum requirements of subsection 501.2 are 
met, the Proposed Design complies with the standards.


<R05>
Sec. 434.510  Standard calculation procedure.

    510.1  The Standard Calculation Procedure consists of methods and 
assumptions for calculating the Energy Cost Budget for the Prototype or 
Reference Building and the Design Energy Consumption and Design Energy 
Cost of the Proposed Design. In order to maintain consistency between 
the Energy Cost Budget and the Design Energy Cost, the input assumptions 
to be used are stated below. These inputs shall be used to determine the 
Energy Cost Budget and the Design Energy Consumption.
    510.2  Prescribed assumptions shall be used without variation. 
Default assumptions shall be used unless the designer can demonstrate 
that a different assumption better characterizes the building's energy 
use over its expected life. The default assumptions shall be used in 
modeling both the Prototype or Reference Building and the Proposed 
Design, unless the designer demonstrates clear cause to modify these 
assumptions. Special procedures for speculative buildings are discussed 
in subsection 503. Shell buildings may not use subpart E.


<R05>
Sec. 434.511  Orientation and shape.

    511.1  The Prototype Building shall consist of the same number of 
stories, and gross and conditioned floor area as the Proposed Design, 
with equal area

[[Page 388]]

per story. The building shape shall be rectangular, with a 2.5:1 aspect 
ratio. The long dimensions of the building shall face East and West. The 
fenestration shall be uniformly distributed in proportion to exterior 
wall area. Floor-to-floor height for the Prototype Building shall be 13 
ft. except for dwelling units in hotels/motels and multi-family high-
rise residential buildings where floor-to-floor height shall be 9.5 ft.
    511.2  The Reference Building shall consist of the same number of 
stories, and gross floor area for each story as the Proposed Design. 
Each floor shall be oriented in the same manner as the Proposed Design. 
The geometric form shall be the same as the Proposed Design.


<R05>
Sec. 434.512  Internal loads.

    512.1  The systems and types of energy specified in this section are 
provided only for purposes of calculating the Energy Cost Budget. They 
are not requirements for either systems or the type of energy to be used 
in the Proposed Design or for calculation of Design Energy Cost.
    512.2  Internal loads for multi-family high-rise residential 
buildings are prescribed in Tables 512.2.a and b, Multi-Family High Rise 
Residential Building Schedules. Internal loads for other building types 
shall be modeled as noted in this subsection.

Sec. 434.514  Lighting.

    514.1  Interior Lighting Power Allowance (ILPA), for calculating the 
Energy Cost Budget shall be determined from subsection 401.3.2. The 
lighting power used to calculate the Design Energy Consumption shall be 
the actual adjusted power for lighting in the Proposed Design. If the 
lighting controls in the Proposed Design are more effective at saving 
energy than those required by subsection 401.3.1 and 401.3.2, the actual 
installed lighting power shall be used along with the schedules 
reflecting the action of the controls to calculate the Design Energy 
Consumption. This actual installed lighting

    514.2  Table 513.2.b establishes default assumptions for the 
percentage of the lighting load switched-on in each Prototype or 
Reference Building by hour of the day. These default assumptions can be 
changed when calculating the Energy Cost Budget to provide, for example, 
a 12-hour rather than an 8-hour workday.

Sec. 434.515  Receptacles.

    515.1  Receptacle loads and profiles are default assumptions. The 
same assumptions shall be made in calculating Design Energy Consumption 
as were used in calculating the Energy Cost Budget.
    515.2  Receptacle loads include all general service loads that are 
typical in a building. These loads exclude any process electrical usage 
and HVAC primary or auxiliary electrical usage. Table 515.2, Receptacle 
Power Densities, establishes the density, in W/ft\2\, to be used for 
each building type. The receptacle energy profiles shall be the same as 
the lighting energy profiles in Table 513.2.b. This profile establishes 
the percentage of the receptacle load that is switched on by hour of the 
day and by building type.

Sec. 434.516  Building exterior envelope.

    516.1  Insulation and Glazing. The insulation and glazing 
characteristics of the Prototype and Reference Building envelope shall 
be determined by using the first column under ``Base Case'', with no 
assumed overhangs, for the appropriate Alternate Component Tables (ACP) 
in Table 402.4.1.2, as defined by climate range. The insulation and 
glazing characteristics from this ACP are prescribed assumptions for 
Prototype and Reference Buildings for calculating the Energy Cost 
Budget. In calculating the Design Energy Consumption of the Proposed 
Design, the envelope characteristics of the Proposed Design shall be 
used.
    516.2  Infiltration. For Prototype and Reference Buildings, the 
infiltration assumptions in subsection 516.2.1 shall be prescribed 
assumptions for calculating the Energy Cost Budget and default 
assumptions for the Design Energy Consumption. Infiltration shall impact 
perimeter zones only.
    516.2.1  When the HVAC system is switched ``on,'' no infiltration 
shall be assumed. When the HVAC system is switched ``off,'' the 
infiltration rate for buildings with or without operable windows shall 
be assumed to be 0.038 cfm/ft\2\ of gross exterior wall. Hotels/motels 
and multi-family high-rise residential buildings shall have infiltration 
rates of 0.038 cfm/ft\2\ of gross exterior wall area at all times.
    516.3  Envelope and Ground Absorptivities. For Prototype and 
Reference Buildings, absorptivity assumptions shall be prescribed 
assumptions for computing the Energy Cost Budget and default assumptions 
for computing the Design Energy Consumption. The solar absorptivity of 
opaque elements of the building envelope is assumed to be 70%. The solar 
absorptivity of ground surfaces is assumed to be 80% (20% reflectivity).
    516.4  Window Management. For the Prototype and Reference Building, 
window management drapery assumptions shall be prescribed assumptions 
for setting the Energy Cost Budget. No draperies shall be the default 
assumption for computing the Design Energy Consumption. Glazing is 
assumed to be internally shaded by medium-weight draperies, closed one-
half time. The

[[Page 398]]

draperies shall be modeled by assuming that one-half the area in each 
zone is draped and one-half is not. If manually-operated draperies, 
shades, or blinds are to be used in the Proposed Design, the Design 
Energy Consumption shall be calculated by assuming they are effective 
over one-half the glazing area in each zone.
    516.5  Shading. For Prototype and Reference buildings and the 
Proposed Design, shading by permanent structures, terrain, and 
vegetation shall be taken into account for computing energy consumption, 
whether or not these features are located on the building site. A 
permanent fixture is one that is likely to remain for the life of the 
Proposed Design.


<R05>
Sec. 434.517  HVAC systems and equipment.

    517.1  The specifications and requirements for the HVAC systems of 
the Prototype and Reference Buildings shall be those in Table 517.1.1, 
HVAC Systems for Prototype and Reference Buildings. For the calculation 
of the Design Energy Consumption, the HVAC systems and equipment of the 
Proposed Design shall be used.
    517.2  The systems and types of energy presented in Table 517.1.1 
are assumptions for calculating the Energy Cost Budget. They are not 
requirements for either systems or the type of energy to be used in the 
Proposed Building or for the calculation of the Design Energy Cost.

\1\ Space and Service Water Heating budget calculations shall be made
  using both electricity and natural gas. The Energy Cost Budget shall
  be the lower of these two calculations. If natural gas is not
  available at the rate, electricity and <greek-i>2 fuel oil shall be
  used for the budget calculations.
\2\ The system and energy types presented in this Table are not intended
  as requirements or recommendations for the proposed design. Floor
  areas below are the total conditioned floor areas for the listed
  occupancy type in the building. The number of floors indicated below
  is the total number of occupied floors for the listed occupancy type.

    517.3  HVAC Zones. HVAC zones for calculating the Energy Cost Budget 
of the Prototype or Reference Building shall consist of at least four 
perimeter and one interior zones per floor. Prototype Buildings shall 
have one perimeter zone facing each cardinal direction. The perimeter 
zones of Prototype and Reference Buildings shall be 15 ft in width, or 
one-third the narrow dimension of the building, when this dimension is 
between 30 ft and 45 ft inclusive, or one-half the narrow dimension of 
the building when this dimension is less than 30 ft. Zoning requirements 
shall be a default assumption for calculating the Energy Cost Budget. 
For multi-family high-rise residential

[[Page 399]]

buildings, the prototype building shall have one zone per dwelling unit. 
The proposed design shall have one zone per unit unless zonal 
thermostatic controls are provided within units; in this case, two zones 
per unit shall be modeled. Building types such as assembly or warehouse 
may be modeled as a single zone if there is only one space.
    517.4  For calculating the Design Energy Consumption, no fewer zones 
shall be used than were in the Prototype and Reference Buildings. The 
zones in the simulation shall correspond to the zones provided by the 
controls in the Proposed Design. Thermally similar zones, such as those 
facing one orientation on different floors, may be grouped together for 
the purposes of either the Design Energy Consumption or Energy Cost 
Budget simulation.

                    Numbered Notes for Table 517.4.1

     HVAC System Descriptions for Prototype and Reference Buildings

                                 Notes:

    1. For occupancies such as restaurants, assembly and retail which 
are part of a mixed use building which, according to Table 517.4.1, 
includes a central chilled water plant (systems 3, 5, or 6), chilled 
water system type 3 or 5, as indicated in the Table, shall be used.
    2. Constant volume may be used in zones where pressurization 
relationships must be maintained by code. VAV shall be used in all other 
areas, in accordance with Sec. 517.4
    3. Provide run-around heat recovery systems for all fan systems with 
minimum outside air intake greater than 75%. Recovery effectiveness 
shall be 0.60.
    4. If a warehouse is not intended to be mechanically cooled, both 
the Energy Cost Budgets and Design Energy Costs, may be calculated 
assuming no mechanical cooling.
    5. The system listed is for guest rooms only. Areas such as public 
areas and back-of-house areas shall be served by system 4. Other areas 
such as offices and retail shall be served by the systems listed in 
Table 517.4.1 for those occupancy types.
    6. The system listed is for guest rooms only. Areas such as public 
areas and back-of-house areas shall be served by System 5. Other areas 
such as offices and retail shall be served by the systems listed in 
Table 517.4.1.1 for those occupancy types.
    7. System 2 shall be used for Energy Cost Budget calculation except 
in areas with design heating outside air temperatures less than 
10 deg.F.
    8. Prototype energy budget cost calculations shall be made using 
both electricity and natural gas. If natural gas is not available at the 
site, electricity and <greek-i>2 fuel oil shall be used. The Energy Cost 
Budget shall be the lower of these results. Alternatively, the Energy 
Cost Budget may be based on the fuel source that minimizes total 
operating, maintenance, equipment, and installation costs for the 
prototype over the building lifetime. Equipment and installation cost 
estimates shall be prepared using professionally recognized cost 
estimating tools, guides, and techniques. The methods of analysis shall 
conform to those of Subpart A of 10 CFR part 436. Energy costs shall be 
based on actual costs to the building as defined in this Section.
    9. Design supply air circulation rate shall be based on a supply air 
to room air temperature differences of 20 deg.F. A higher supply air 
temperature may be used if required to maintain a minimum circulation 
rate of 4.5 air changes per hour or 15 cfm per person at design 
conditions to each zone served by the system. If return fans are 
specified, they shall be sized from the supply fan capacity less the 
required minimum ventilation with outside air, or 75% or the supply air 
capacity, whichever is larger. Except where noted, supply and return 
fans shall be operated continually during occupied hours.
    10. Fan System Energy when included in the efficiency rating of the 
unit as defined in Sec. 403.2.4.3 need not be modeled explicitly for 
this system. The fan shall cycle with calls for heating or cooling.
    11. Chilled water systems shall be modeled using a reciprocating 
chiller for systems with total cooling capacities less than 175 tons, 
and centrifugal chillers for systems

[[Page 401]]

with cooling capacities of 175 tons or greater. For systems with cooling 
or 600 ton or more, the Energy Cost Budget shall be calculated using two 
centrifugal chillers lead/lag controlled. Chilled water pumps shall be 
sized using a 12 deg.F temperature rise, from 44 deg.F to 56 deg.F 
operating at 65 feed of head and 65% combined impeller and motor 
efficiency. Condenser water pumps shall be sized using a 10 deg.F 
temperature rise, operating at 60 feet of head and 60% combined impeller 
and motor efficiency. The cooling tower shall be an open circuit, 
centrifugal blower type sized for the larger of 85 deg.F leaving water 
temperature or 10 deg.F approach to design wet bulb temperature. The 
tower shall be controlled to provide a 65 deg.F leaving water 
temperature whenever weather conditions permit, floating up to design 
leaving water temperature at design conditions. Chilled water supply 
temperature shall be reset in accordance with Sec. 434.518.
    12. Hot water system shall include a natural draft fossil fuel or 
electric boiler per Note 8. The hot water pump shall be sized based on a 
30 deg.F temperature drop, for 18 deg.F to 150 deg.F, operating at 60 
feet of head and a combined impeller and motor efficiency of 60%. Hot 
water supply temperature shall be reset in accordance with Sec. 434.518.

    517.5  Equipment Sizing and Redundant Equipment. For calculating the 
Energy Cost Budget of Prototype or Reference Buildings, HVAC equipment 
shall be sized to meet the requirements of subsection 403.2.2, without 
using any of the exceptions. The size of equipment shall be that 
required for the building without process loads considered. Redundant or 
emergency equipment need not be simulated if it is controlled so that it 
will not be operated during normal operations of the building. The 
designer shall document the installation of process equipment and the 
size of process loads.
    517.6  For calculating the Design Energy Consumption, actual air 
flow rates and installed equipment size shall be used in the simulation, 
except that excess capacity provided to meet process loads need not be 
modeled unless the process load was not modeled in setting Energy Cost 
Budget. Equipment sizing in the simulation of the Proposed Design shall 
correspond to the equipment actually selected for the design and the 
designer shall not use equipment sized automatically by the simulation 
tool.
    517.6.1  Redundant or emergency equipment need not be simulated if 
it is controlled to not be operated during normal operations of the 
building.

Sec. 434.518  Service water heating.

    518.1  The service water loads for Prototype and Reference Buildings 
are defined in terms of Btu/h per person in Table 518.1.1, Service Hot 
Water Quantities. The service water heating loads from Table 518.1.1 are 
prescribed assumptions for multi-family high-rise residential buildings 
and default assumptions for all other buildings. The same service water 
heating load assumptions shall be made in calculating Design Energy 
Consumption as were used in calculating the Energy Cost Budget.

  Table 513.2.a for occupancy levels.
\2\ Total hot water use per dwelling unit for each hour shall be 3,400
  Btu/h times the multi-family high rise residential building SWH system
  multiplier from Table 513.2.b.

    518.2  The service water heating system, including piping losses for 
the Prototype Building, shall be modeled using the methods of the RS-47 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 434.701) using a system that meets 
all requirements of subsection 404. The service water heating equipment 
for the Prototype or Reference Building shall be either an electric heat 
pump or natural gas, or if natural gas is not available at the site, 
<greek-i>2 fuel oil. Exception: If electric resistance service water 
heating is preferable to an electric heat pump when analyzed according 
to the criteria of Sec. 434.404.1.4 or when service water temperatures 
exceeding 145 deg.F are required for a particular application, electric 
resistance water heating may be used.


<R05>
Sec. 434.519  Controls.

    519.1  All occupied conditioned spaces in the Prototype, Reference 
and

[[Page 402]]

Proposed Design Buildings in all climates shall be simulated as being 
both heated and cooled. The assumptions in this subsection are 
prescribed assumptions. If the Proposed Design does not include 
equipment for cooling or heating, the Design Energy Consumption shall be 
determined by the specifications for calculating the Energy Cost Budget 
as described in Table 517.4.1 HVAC System Description for Prototype and 
Reference Buildings. Exceptions to 519.1 are as follows:
    519.1.1  If a building is to be provided with only heating or 
cooling, both the Prototype or Reference Building and the Proposed 
Design shall be simulated, using the same assumptions. Such an 
assumption cannot be made unless the building interior temperature meets 
the comfort criteria of RS-2 (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 434.701) at least 98% of the occupied hours during the year.
    519.1.2  If warehouses are not intended to be mechanically cooled, 
both the Energy Cost Budget and Design Energy Consumption shall be 
modeled assuming no mechanical cooling; and
    519.1.3  In climates where winter design temperature (97.5% 
occurrence) is greater than 59 deg.F, space heating need not be modeled.
    519.2   Space temperature controls for the Prototype or Reference 
Building, except multi-family high-rise residential buildings, shall be 
set at 70 deg.F for space heating and 75 deg.F for space cooling with a 
deadband per subsection 403.2.6.3. The system shut off during off-hours 
shall be according to the schedule in Table 515.2, except that the 
heating system shall cycle on if any space should drop below the night 
setback setting of 55 deg.F. There shall be no similar setpoint during 
the cooling season. Lesser deadband ranges may be used in calculating 
the Design Energy Consumption. Exceptions to 519.2 are as follows:
    (a) Setback shall not be modeled in determining either the Energy 
Cost Budget or Design Energy Cost if setback is not realistic for the 
Proposed Design, such as 24-hour/day operations. Health facilities need 
not have night setback during the heating season; and
    (b) Hotel/motels and multi-family high-rise residential buildings 
shall have a night setback temperature of 60  deg.F from 11:00 p.m. to 
6:00 a.m. during the heating season; and
    (c) If deadband controls are not to be installed, the Design Energy 
Cost shall be calculated with both heating and cooling thermostat 
setpoints set to the same value between 70  deg.F and 75  deg.F 
inclusive, assumed to be constant for the year.
    519.2.1  For multi-family buildings, the thermostat schedule for the 
dwelling units shall be as in Table 519.1.2, Thermostat Settings for 
Multi-Family High-rise Buildings. The Prototype Building shall use the 
single zone schedule. The Proposed Design shall use the two-zone 
schedule only if zonal thermostatic controls are provided. For Proposed 
Designs that use heat pumps employing supplementary heat, the controls 
used to switch on the auxiliary heat source during morning warm-up 
periods shall be simulated accurately. The thermostat assumptions for 
multi-family high-rise buildings are prescribed assumptions.
    519.3  When providing for outdoor air ventilation in calculating the 
Energy Cost Budget, controls shall be assumed to close the outside air 
intake to reduce the flow of outside air to 0 cfm during setback and 
unoccupied periods. Ventilation using inside air may still be required 
to maintain scheduled setback temperature. Outside air ventilation, 
during occupied periods, shall be as required by RS-41, (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 434.701) or the Proposed Design, whichever is 
greater.
    519.4  If humidification is to be used in the Proposed Design, the 
same level of humidification and system type shall be used in the 
Prototype or Reference Building. If dehumidification requires subcooling 
of supply air, then reheat for the Prototype or Reference Building shall 
be from recovered waste heat such as condenser waste heat.

Sec. 434.520  Speculative buildings.

    520.1  Lighting. The interior lighting power allowance (ILPA) for 
calculating the Energy Cost Budget shall be determined from Table 
401.3.2a. The Design Energy Consumption may be based on an assumed 
adjusted lighting power for future lighting improvements.
    520.2  The assumption about future lighting power used to calculate 
the Design Energy Consumption must be documented so that the future 
installed lighting systems may be in compliance with these standards. 
Documentation must be provided to enable future lighting systems to use 
either the Prescriptive method or the Systems Performance method of 
subsection 401.3.
    520.3  Documentation for future lighting systems that use subsection 
401.3 shall be stated as a maximum adjusted lighting power for the 
tenant spaces. The adjusted lighting power allowance for tenant spaces 
shall account for the lighting power provided for the common areas of 
the building.
    520.4  Documentation for future lighting systems that use subsection 
401.3 shall be stated as a required lighting adjustment. The required 
lighting adjustment is the whole building lighting power assumed in 
order to calculate the Design Energy Consumption minus the ILPA value 
from Table 401.3.2c that was used to calculate the Energy Cost Budget. 
When the required lighting adjustment is less than zero, a complete 
lighting design must be developed for one or more representative tenant 
spaces, demonstrating acceptable lighting within the limits of the 
assumed lighting power allowance.
    520.5  HVAC Systems and Equipment. If the HVAC system is not 
completely specified in the plans, the Design Energy Consumption shall 
be based on reasonable assumptions about the construction of future HVAC 
systems and equipment. These assumptions shall be documented so that 
future HVAC systems and equipment may be in compliance with these 
standards.


<R05>
Sec. 434.521  The simulation tool.

    521.1  Annual energy consumption shall be simulated with a multi-
zone, 8760 hours per year building energy model. The model shall account 
for:
    521.1.1  The dynamic heat transfer of the building envelope such as 
solar and internal gains;
    521.1.2  Equipment efficiencies as a function of load and climate;
    521.1.3  Lighting and HVAC system controls and distribution systems 
by simulating the whole building;
    521.1.4  The operating schedule of the building including night 
setback during various times of the year; and
    521.1.5  Energy consumption information at a level necessary to 
determine the Energy Cost Budget and Design Energy Cost through the 
appropriate utility rate schedules.
    521.1.6  While the simulation tool should simulate an entire year on 
an hour by hour basis (8760 hours), programs that approximate this 
dynamic analysis procedure and provide equivalent results are 
acceptable.
    521.1.7  Simulation tools shall be selected for their ability to 
simulate accurately the relevant features of the building in question, 
as shown in the tool's documentation. For example, a single-zone model 
shall not be used to simulate a large, multi-zone building, and a 
steady-state model such as the degree-day method shall not be used to 
simulate buildings when equipment efficiency or performance is 
significantly affected by the dynamic patterns of weather, solar 
radiation, and occupancy. Relevant energy-related features shall be 
addressed by a model such as daylighting, atriums or sunspaces, night 
ventilation or thermal storage, chilled water storage or heat recovery, 
active or passive solar systems, zoning and controls of heating and 
cooling systems, and ground-coupled buildings. In addition, models shall 
be capable of translating the Design Energy Consumption into energy cost 
using actual utility rate schedules with the coincidental electrical 
demand of a building. Examples of public domain models capable of 
handling such complex building systems and energy cost translations 
available in the United States are DOE--2.1C and BLAST 3.0 and in 
Canada, Energy Systems Analysis Series.

            Subpart F--Building Energy Compliance Alternative


<R05>
Sec. 434.601  General.

    601.1  This subpart provides an alternative path for compliance with 
the standards that allow for greater flexibility in the design of energy 
efficient buildings using an annual energy use method. This path 
provides an opportunity for the use of innovative designs, materials, 
and equipment such as daylighting, passive solar heating, and heat 
recovery, that may not be adequately evaluated by methods found in 
Subpart D.
    601.2  The Building Energy Compliance Alternative shall be used with 
subpart C and subpart D, 401.1, 401.2, 401.3.4 and in conjunction with 
the minimum requirements found in subsections 402.1, 402.2, and 402.3., 
403.1, 403.2.1-7, 403.2.9 and 404.
    601.3  Compliance under this section is demonstrated by showing that 
the calculated annual energy usage for the Proposed Design is less than 
or equal to a calculated Energy Use Budget. (See Figure 601.3, Building 
Energy Compliance Alternative). The analytical procedures in this 
subpart are only for determining design compliance, and are not to be 
used either to predict, document or verify annual energy consumption.

[[Page 406]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.017

    601.4  Compliance under the Building Energy Use Budget method 
requires a detailed energy analysis, using a conventional simulation 
tool, of the Proposed Design. A life cycle cost analysis shall be used 
to select the fuel source for the HVAC systems, service hot water, and 
process loads from available alternatives. The Annual Energy Consumption 
of the Proposed Design with the life cycle cost-effective fuel selection 
is calculated to determine the modeled energy consumption, called the 
Design Energy Use.
    601.5 The Design Energy Use is defined as the energy that is 
consumed within the five foot line of a proposed building per 
ft<SUP>2</SUP> over a 24-hour day, 365-

[[Page 407]]

day year period and specified operating hours. The calculated Design 
Energy Use is then compared to a calculated Energy Use Budget.
    601.6 Compliance. The Energy Use Budget is determined by calculating 
the annual energy usage for a Reference or Prototype Building that is 
configured to comply with the provisions of Subpart E for such 
buildings, except that the fuel source(s) of the Prototype or Reference 
Building shall be the same life cycle cost-effective source(s) selected 
for the Proposed Design. If the Design Energy Use is less than or equal 
to the Energy Use Budget then the proposed design complies with these 
standards.
    601.7 This section provides instructions for determining the Design 
Energy Use and for calculating the Energy Use Budget. The Energy Use 
Budget is the highest allowable calculated annual energy consumption for 
a specified building design. Designers are encouraged to design 
buildings whose Design Energy Use is lower than the Energy Use Budget.


<R05>
Sec. 434.602  Determination of the annual energy budget.

    602.1 The Energy Use Budget shall be calculated for the appropriate 
Prototype or Reference Building in accordance with the procedures 
prescribed in subsection 502 with the following exceptions: The Energy 
Use Budget shall be stated in units of Btu/ft<SUP>2</SUP>/yr and the 
simulation tool shall segregate the calculated energy consumption by 
fuel type producing an Energy Use Budget for each fuel (the fuel 
selections having been made by a life cycle cost analysis in determining 
the proposed design).
    602.2 The Energy Use Budget is calculated similarly for the 
Reference or Prototype Building using equation 602.2.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.029

    Where EUB<INF>1</INF>, EUB<INF>2</INF>, EUB<INF>i</INF> are the 
calculated annual energy targets for each fuel used in the Reference or 
Prototype building and f<INF>1</INF>, f<INF>2</INF>, . . . f<INF>i</INF> 
are the energy conversion factors given in Table 602.2, Fuel Conversion 
Factors for Computing Design Annual Energy Uses. In lieu of case by case 
calculation of the Energy Use Budget, the designer may construct Energy 
Use Budget tables for the combinations of energy source(s) that may be 
considered in a set of project designs, such as electric heating, 
electric service water, and gas cooling or oil heating, gas service 
water and electric cooling. The values in such optional Energy Use 
Budget tables shall be equal to or less than the corresponding Energy 
Use Budgets calculated on a case by case basis according to this 
section. Energy Use Budget tables shall be constructed to correspond to 
the climatic regions and building types in accordance with provisions 
for Prototype or Reference Building models in subpart E of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 434.603  Determination of the design energy use.

    603.1  The Design Energy Use shall be calculated by modeling the 
Proposed Design using the same methods, assumptions, climate data, and 
simulation tool as were used to establish the Energy Use Budget, but 
with the design features that will be used in the final building design. 
The simulation tool used shall segregate the calculated energy 
consumption by fuel type giving an annual Design Energy Use for each 
fuel. The sum of the Design Energy Uses multiplied by the fuel 
conversion factors in Table 602.2 yields the Design Energy Use for the 
proposed design:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.030

    Where f<INF>1</INF>, f<INF>2</INF>, * * * f<INF>i</INF> are the fuel 
conversion factors in Table 602.2.
    603.2 Required Life Cycle Cost Analysis for Fuel Selection.
    603.2.1 Fuel sources selected for the Proposed Design and Prototype 
or Reference buildings shall be determined by considering the energy 
cost and other costs and cost savings that occur during the expected 
economic life of the alternative.
    603.2.2 The designer shall use the procedures set forth in subpart A 
of 10 CFR part 436 to make this determination. The fuel selection life 
cycle cost analysis shall include the following steps:
    603.2.2.1 Determine the feasible alternatives for energy sources of 
the Proposed Design's HVAC systems, service hot water, and process 
loads.
    603.2.2.2 Model the Proposed Design including the alternative HVAC 
and service water systems and conduct an annual energy analysis for each 
fuel source alternative using the simulation tool specified in this 
section. The annual energy analysis shall be computed on a monthly basis 
in conformance with subpart E with the exception that all process loads 
shall be included in the calculation. Separate the output of the 
analysis by fuel type.
    603.2.2.3 Determine the unit price of each fuel using information 
from the utility or other reliable local source. During rapid changes in 
fuel prices it is recommended that an average fuel price for the 
previous twelve months be used in lieu of the current price. Calculate 
the annual energy cost of each energy source alternative in accordance 
with procedures in subpart E for the Design Energy Cost. Estimate the 
initial cost of the HVAC and service water systems and other initial 
costs such as energy distribution lines and service connection fees 
associated with each fuel source alternative. Estimate other costs and 
benefits for each alternative including, but not necessarily limited to, 
annual maintenance and repair, periodic and one time major repairs and 
replacements and salvage of the energy and service water systems. Cost 
estimates shall be prepared using professionally recognized cost 
estimating tools, guides and techniques.
    603.2.2.4 Perform a life cycle cost analysis using the procedure 
specified in subsection 603.2.
    603.2.2.5 Compare the total life cycle cost of each energy source 
alternative. The alternative with the lowest total life cycle cost shall 
be chosen as the energy source for the proposed design.


<R05>
Sec. 434.604  Compliance.

    604.1 Compliance with this section is demonstrated if the Design 
Energy Use is equal to or less than the Energy Use Budget.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.031

    604.2 The energy consumption shall be measured at the building five 
foot line for all fuels. Energy consumed from non-depletable energy 
sources and heat recovery systems shall not be included in the Design 
Energy Use calculations. The thermal efficiency of fixtures, equipment, 
systems or plants in the proposed design shall be simulated by the 
selected calculation tool.

<R05>
Sec. 434.605  Standard Calculation Procedure.

    605.1 The Standard Calculation Procedure consists of methods and 
assumptions for calculating the Energy Use Budgets for Prototype and 
Reference Buildings and the Energy Use for the Proposed Design. In order 
to maintain consistency between the Energy Use Budgets and the Design 
Energy Use, the input assumptions stated in subsection 510.2 are to be 
used.
    605.2 The terms Energy Cost Budget and Design Energy Cost or Design 
Energy Consumption used in subpart E of this part correlate to Energy 
Use Budget and Design Energy Use, respectively, in subpart F of this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 434.606  Simulation tool.

    606.1 The criteria established in subsection 521 for the selection 
of a simulation tool shall be followed when using the compliance path 
prescribed in subpart F of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 434.607  Life cycle cost analysis criteria.

    607.1 The following life cycle cost criteria applies to the fuel 
selection requirements of this subpart and to option life cycle cost 
analyses performed to evaluate energy conservation design alternatives. 
The fuel source(s) selection shall be made in accordance with the 
requirements of subpart A of 10 CFR part 436. When performing optional 
life cycle cost analyses of energy conservation opportunities the 
designer may use the life cycle cost procedures of subpart A of 10 CFR 
part 436 or OMB Circular 1-94 or an equivalent procedure that meets the 
assumptions listed below:
    607.1.1 The economic life of the Prototype Building and Proposed 
Design shall be 25 years. Anticipated replacements or renovations of 
energy related features and systems in the Prototype or Reference 
Building and Proposed Design during this period shall be included in 
their respective life cycle cost calculations.
    607.1.2 The designer shall follow established professional cost 
estimating practices when determining the costs and benefits associated 
with the energy related features of the Prototype or Reference Building 
and Proposed Design.
    607.1.3 All costs shall be expressed in current dollars. General 
inflation shall be disregarded. Differential escalation of prices 
(prices estimated to rise faster or slower than general inflation) for 
energy used in the life cycle cost calculations shall be those in effect 
at the time of the latest ``Annual Energy Outlook'' (DOE/EIA-0383) as 
published by the Department of Energy's Energy Information 
Administration.
    607.1.4 The economic effects of taxes, depreciation and other 
factors not consistent with the practices of subpart A of 10 CFR part 
436 shall not be included in the life cycle cost calculation.

Sec. 435.303  Requirements for the design of a Federal residential building.

    (a) The head of each Federal agency responsible for the construction 
of Federal residential buildings shall establish an energy consumption 
goal for each building to be designed or constructed by or for the 
agency.
    (b) The energy consumption goal for a Federal residential building 
shall be a total point score derived by using the micro-computer program 
and user manual entitled ``Conservation Optimization Standard for 
Savings in Federal Residences (COSTSAFR),'' unless the head of the 
Federal agency shall establish more stringent requirements for that 
agency.
    (c) The head of each Federal agency shall adopt such procedures as 
may be necessary to ensure that the design of a Federal residential 
building is not less energy conserving than the energy consumption goal 
established for the building.


<R05>
Sec. 435.304  The COSTSAFR Program.

    (a) The COSTSAFR Program (Version 3.0) provides a computerized 
calculation procedure to determine the most effective set of energy 
conservation measures, selected from among the measures included within 
the Program that will produce the practicable optimum life cycle cost 
for a type of residential building in a specific geographic location. 
The most effective set of energy conservation measures is expressed as a 
total point score that serves as the energy consumption goal.
    (b) The COSTSAFR Program (Version 3.0) also prints out a point 
system that identifies a wide array of different energy conservation 
measures indicating how many points various levels of each measure would 
contribute to reaching the total point score of the energy consumption 
goal.

[[Page 415]]

This enables a Federal agency to use the energy consumption goal and the 
point system in the design and procurement procedures so that designers 
and builders can pick and choose among different combinations of energy 
conservation measures to meet or exceed the total point score required 
to meet the energy consumption goal.
    (c) The COSTSAFR Program (Version 3.0) operates on a micro-computer 
system that uses the MS DOS operating system and is equipped with an 
8087 co-processor.
    (d) The COSTSAFR Program (Version 3.0) may be obtained from:

National Technical Information Service; Department of Commerce;

    (a) If a proposed building design includes unusual or innovative 
energy conservation measures which are not covered by the COSTSAFR 
program, the Federal agency shall determine whether that design meets or 
exceeds the applicable energy consumption goal in compliance with the 
procedures set forth in this section.
    (b) The Federal agency shall determine the estimated discounted 
energy cost for the COSTSAFR prototype building design, which is the 
most similar of the COSTSAFR prototypes to the proposed building design,

showing the points attributable to levels of various energy conservation 
measures;
    (2) Calculating the estimated unit energy cost on the compliance 
forms, on the basis of selecting the optimum levels on the compliance 
forms or otherwise in the User's Manual for each energy conservation

    (c) The Federal agency shall determine the estimated discounted 
energy cost for the proposed building design by--
    (1) Estimating the heating and cooling total annual coil loads of 
the proposed building design with the DOE 2.1C computer program on the 
basis of input assumptions including--
    (i) Shading coefficients of 0.6 for summer and 0.8 for winter;
    (ii) Thermostat setpoints of 78 degrees Fahrenheit for cooling, 70

    (iii) The infiltration rate measured in air changes per hour as 
calculated using appendix B of the COSTSAFR User's Manual;
    (iv) Natural venting with a constant air change rate of 10 air

Sec. 436.12  Life cycle cost methodology.

    The life cycle cost methodology for this part is a systematic 
analysis of relevant costs, excluding sunk costs, over a study period, 
relating initial costs to future costs by the technique of discounting 
future costs to present values.

Sec. 436.13  Presuming cost-effectiveness results.

    (a) If the investment and other costs for an energy or water 
conservation measure considered for retrofit to an existing Federal 
building or a building energy system or building water system considered 
for incorporation into a new building design are insignificant, a 
Federal agency may presume that such a system is life cycle cost-
effective without further analysis.
    (b) A Federal agency may presume that an investment in an energy or 
water conservation measure retrofit to an existing Federal building is 
not life cycle cost-effective for Federal investment if the Federal 
building is--
    (1) Occupied under a short-term lease with a remaining term of one 
year or less, and without a renewal option or with a renewal option 
which is not likely to be exercised;
    (2) Occupied under a lease which includes the cost of utilities in 
the rent and does not provide a pass-through of energy or water savings 
to the government; or
    (3) Scheduled to be demolished or retired from service within one 
year or less.

<R05>
Sec. 436.14  Methodological assumptions.

    (a) Each Federal Agency shall discount to present values the future 
cash flows established in either current or constant dollars consistent 
with the nominal or real discount rate, and related tables, published in 
the annual supplement to the Life Cycle Costing Manual for the Federal 
Energy Management Program (NIST 85-3273) and determined annually by DOE 
as follows--
    (1) The nominal discount rate shall be a 12 month average of the 
composite yields of all outstanding U.S. Treasury bonds neither due nor 
callable in less than ten years, as most recently reported by the 
Federal Reserve Board; and
    (2) Subject to a ceiling of 10 percent and a floor of three percent 
the real discount rate shall be a 12 month average of the composite 
yields of all outstanding U.S. Treasury bonds neither due nor callable 
in less than ten years, as most recently reported by the Federal Reserve 
Board, adjusted to exclude estimated increases in the general level of 
prices consistent with projections of inflation in the most recent 
Economic Report of the President's Council of Economic Advisors.
    (b) Each Federal agency shall assume that energy prices will change 
at rates projected by DOE's Energy Information Administration and 
published by NIST annually no later than the beginning of the fiscal 
year in the Annual Supplement to the Life Cycle Costing Manual for the

discount rate determined by DOE under paragraph (a) of this section, 
except that--
    (1) If the Federal agency is using component prices under 
Sec. 436.14(c), that agency may use corresponding component escalation 
rates provided by the energy or water supplier.
    (2) For Federal buildings in foreign countries, the Federal agency 
may use a ``reasonable'' escalation rate.
    (c) Each Federal agency shall assume that the price of energy or 
water in the base year is the actual price charged for energy or water 
delivered to the Federal building and may use actual component prices as 
provided by the energy or water supplier.

[[Page 420]]

    (d) Each Federal agency shall assume that the appropriate study 
period is as follows:
    (1) For evaluating and ranking alternative retrofits for an existing 
Federal building, the study period is the expected life of the retrofit, 
or 25 years from the beginning of beneficial use, whichever is shorter.
    (2) For determining the life cycle costs or net savings of mutually 
exclusive alternatives for a given building energy system or building 
water system (e.g., alternative designs for a particular system or size 
of a new or retrofit building energy system or building water system), a 
uniform study period for all alternatives shall be assumed which is 
equal to--
    (i) The estimated life of the mutually exclusive alternative having 
the longest life, not to exceed 25 years from the beginning of 
beneficial use with appropriate replacement and salvage values for each 
of the other alternatives; or
    (ii) The lowest common multiple of the expected lives of the 
alternative, not to exceed 25 from the beginning of beneficial use with 
appropriate replacement and salvage values for each alternative.
    (3) For evaluating alternative designs for a new Federal building, 
the study period extends from the base year through the expected life of 
the building or 25 years from the beginning of beneficial use, whichever 
is shorter.
    (e) Each Federal agency shall assume that the expected life of any 
building energy system or building water system is the period of service 
without major renewal or overhaul, as estimated by a qualified engineer 
or architect, as appropriate, or any other reliable source except that 
the period of service of a building energy or water system shall not be 
deemed to exceed the expected life of the owned building, or the 
effective remaining term of the leased building (taking into account 
renewal options likely to be exercised).
    (f) Each Federal agency may assume that investment costs are a lump 
sum occurring at the beginning of the base year, or may discount future 
investment costs to present value using the appropriate present worth 
factors under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (g) Each Federal agency may assume that energy or water costs and 
non-fuel or non-water operation and maintenance costs begin to accrue at 
the beginning of the base year or when actually projected to occur.
    (h) Each Federal agency may assume that costs occur in a lump sum at 
any time within the year in which they are incurred.
    (i) This section shall not apply to calculations of estimated simple 
payback time under Sec. 436.22 of this part.

Sec. 436.15  Formatting cost data.

    In establishing cost data under Secs. 436.16 and 436.17 and 
measuring cost effectiveness by the modes of analysis described by 
Sec. 436.19 through Sec. 436.22, a format for accomplishing the analysis 
which includes all required input data and assumptions shall be used. 
Subject to Sec. 436.18(b), Federal agencies are encouraged to use 
worksheets or computer software referenced in the Life Cycle Cost Manual 
for the Federal Energy Management Program.


<R05>
Sec. 436.16  Establishing non-fuel and non-water cost categories.

    (a) The relevant non-fuel cost categories are--
    (1) Investment costs;
    (2) Non-fuel operation and maintenance cost;
    (3) Replacement cost; and
    (4) Salvage value.
    (b) The relevant non-water cost categories are--
    (1) Investment costs;
    (2) Non-water operation and maintenance cost;
    (3) Replacement cost; and
    (4) Salvage value.
    (c) The present value of recurring costs is the product of the base 
year value of recurring costs as multiplied by the appropriate uniform 
present worth factor under Sec. 436.14, or as calculated by computer 
software indicated in Sec. 436.18(b) and used with the official discount 
rate and escalation rate assumptions under Sec. 436.14. When recurring 
costs begin to accrue at a later time, subtract the present value of 
recurring costs over the delay, calculated using the appropriate uniform 
present

[[Page 421]]

worth factor for the period of the delay, from the present value of 
recurring costs over the study period or, if using computer software, 
indicate a delayed beneficial occupancy date.
    (d) The present value of non-recurring cost under Sec. 436.16(a) is 
the product of the non-recurring costs as multiplied by appropriate 
single present worth factors under Sec. 436.14 for the respective years 
in which the costs are expected to be incurred, or as calculated by 
computer software provided or approved by DOE and used with the official 
discount rate and escalation rate assumptions under Sec. 436.14.

<R05>
Sec. 436.17  Establishing energy or water cost data.

    (a) Each Federal agency shall establish energy costs in the base 
year by multiplying the total units of energy used in the base year by 
the price per unit of energy in the base year as determined in 
accordance with Sec. 436.14(c).
    (b) When energy costs begin to accrue in the base year, the present 
value of energy costs over the study period is the product of energy 
costs in the base year as established under Sec. 436.17(a), multiplied 
by the appropriate modified uniform present worth factor adjusted for 
energy price escalation for the applicable region, sector, fuel type, 
and study period consistent with Sec. 436.14, or as calculated by 
computer software provided or approved by DOE and used with the official 
discount rate and escalation rate assumptions under Sec. 436.14. When 
energy costs begin to accrue at a later time, subtract the present value 
of energy costs over the delay, calculated using the adjusted, modified 
uniform present worth factor for the period of delay, from the present 
value of energy costs over the study period or, if using computer 
software, indicate a delayed beneficial occupancy date.
    (c) Each Federal agency shall establish water costs in the base year 
by multiplying the total units of water used in the base year by the 
price per unit of water in the base year as determined in accordance 
with Sec. 436.14(c).
    (d) When water costs begin to accrue in the base year, the present 
value of water costs over the study period is the product of water costs 
in the base year as established under Sec. 436.17(a), or as calculated 
by computer software provided or approved by DOE and used with the 
official discount rate and assumptions under Sec. 436.14. When water 
costs begin to accrue at a later time, subtract the present value of 
water costs over the delay, calculated using the uniform present worth 
factor for the period of delay, from the present value of water costs 
over the study period or, if using computer software, indicate a delayed 
beneficial occupancy date.

Sec. 436.18  Measuring cost-effectiveness.

    (a) In accordance with this section, each Federal agency shall 
measure cost-effectiveness by combining cost data established under 
Secs. 436.16 and 436.17 in the appropriate mode of analysis as described 
in Sec. 436.19 through Sec. 436.22.
    (b) Federal agencies performing LCC analysis on computers shall use 
either the Federal Buildings Life Cycle Costing (FBLCC) software 
provided by DOE or software consistent with this subpart.
    (c) Replacement of a building energy or water system with an energy 
or water conservation measure by retrofit to an existing Federal 
building or by substitution in the design for a new Federal building 
shall be deemed cost-effective if--
    (1) Life cycle costs, as described by Sec. 436.19, are estimated to 
be lower; or
    (2) Net savings, as described by Sec. 436.20, are estimated to be 
positive; or
    (3) The savings-to-investment ratio, as described by Sec. 436.21, is 
estimated to be greater than one; or
    (4) The adjusted internal rate of return, as described by 
Sec. 436.22, is estimated to be greater than the discount rate as set by 
DOE.
    (d) As a rough measure, each Federal agency may determine estimated 
simple payback time under Sec. 436.23, which indicates whether a 
retrofit is likely to be cost effective under one of the four 
calculation methods referenced in Sec. 436.18(c). An energy or water 
conservation measure alternative is likely

[[Page 422]]

to be cost-effective if estimated payback time is significantly less 
than the useful life of that system, and of the Federal building in 
which it is to be installed.
    (e) Mutually exclusive alternatives for a given building energy or 
water system, considered in determining such matters as the optimal size 
of a solar energy system, the optimal thickness of insulation, or the 
best choice of double-glazing or triple-glazing for windows, shall be 
compared and evaluated on the basis of life cycle costs or net savings 
over equivalent study periods. The alternative which is estimated to 
result in the lowest life cycle costs or the highest net savings shall 
be deemed the most cost-effective because it tends to minimize the life 
cycle cost of Federal building.
    (f) When available appropriations will not permit all cost-effective 
energy or water conservation measures to be undertaken, they shall be 
ranked in descending order of their savings-to-investment ratios, or 
their adjusted internal rate of return, to establish priority. If 
available appropriations cannot be fully exhausted for a fiscal year by 
taking all budgeted energy or water conservation measures according to 
their rank, the set of energy or water conservation measures that will 
maximize net savings for available appropriations should be selected.
    (g) Alternative building designs for new Federal buildings shall be 
evaluated on the basis of life cycle costs. The alternative design which 
results in the lowest life cycle costs for a given new building shall be 
deemed the most cost-effective.

Sec. 436.19  Life cycle costs.

    Life cycle costs are the sum of the present values of--
    (a) Investment costs, less salvage values at the end of the study 
period;
    (b) Non-fuel operation and maintenance costs:
    (c) Replacement costs less salvage costs of replaced building 
systems; and
    (d) Energy and/or water costs.

<R05>
Sec. 436.20  Net savings.

    For a retrofit project, net savings may be found by subtracting life 
cycle costs based on the proposed project from life cycle costs based on 
not having it. For a new building design, net savings is the difference 
between the life cycle costs of an alternative design and the life cycle 
costs of the basic design.


<R05>
Sec. 436.21  Savings-to-investment ratio.

    The savings-to-investment ratio is the ratio of the present value 
savings to the present value costs of an energy or water conservation 
measure. The numerator of the ratio is the present value of net savings 
in energy or water and non-fuel or non-water operation and maintenance 
costs attributable to the proposed energy or water conservation measure. 
The denominator of the ratio is the present value of the net increase in 
investment and replacement costs less salvage value attributable to the 
proposed energy or water conservation measure.

<R05>
Sec. 436.22  Adjusted internal rate of return.

    The adjusted internal rate of return is the overall rate of return 
on an energy or water conservation measure. It is calculated by 
subtracting 1 from the nth root of the ratio of the terminal value of 
savings to the present value of costs, where n is the number of years in 
the study period. The numerator of the ratio is calculated by using the 
discount rate to compound forward to the end of the study period the 
yearly net savings in energy or water and non-fuel or non-water 
operation and maintenance costs attributable to the proposed energy or 
water conservation measure. The denominator of the ratio is the present 
value of the net increase in investment and replacement costs less 
salvage value attributable to the proposed energy or water conservation 
measure.

Sec. 436.24  Uncertainty analyses.

    If particular items of cost data or timing of cash flows are 
uncertain and are not fixed under Sec. 436.14, Federal agencies may 
examine the impact of uncertainty on the calculation of life cycle cost 
effectiveness or the assignment of rank order by conducting additional 
analyses using any standard engineering economics method such as 
sensitivity and probabilistic analysis. If additional analysis casts 
substantial doubt on the life cycle cost analysis results, a Federal 
agency should consider obtaining more reliable data or eliminating the 
building energy or water system alternative.

<R05>
Sec. 436.30  Purpose and scope.

    (a) General. This subpart provides procedures and methods which 
apply to Federal agencies with regard to the award and administration of 
energy savings performance contracts awarded on or before September 30, 
2003. This subpart applies in addition to the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation at Title 48 of the CFR and related Federal agency 
regulations. The provisions of this subpart are controlling with regard 
to energy savings performance contracts notwithstanding any conflicting 
provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and related Federal 
agency regulations.
    (b) Utility incentive programs. Nothing in this subpart shall 
preclude a Federal agency from--
    (1) Participating in programs to increase energy efficiency, 
conserve water, or manage electricity demand conducted by gas, water, or 
electric utilities and generally available to customers of such 
utilities;
    (2) Accepting financial incentives, goods, or services generally 
available from any such utility to increase energy efficiency or to 
conserve water or manage electricity demand; or
    (3) Entering into negotiations with electric, water, and gas 
utilities to design cost-effective demand management and conservation 
incentive programs to address the unique needs of each Federal agency.
    (c) Promoting competition. To the extent allowed by law, Federal 
agencies should encourage utilities to select contractors for the 
conduct of utility incentive programs in a competitive manner to the 
maximum extent practicable.
    (d) Interpretations. The permissive provisions of this subpart shall 
be liberally construed to effectuate the objectives of Title VIII of the 
National Energy Conservation Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 8287-8287c.

Sec. 436.31  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart--
    Act means Title VIII of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act.
    Annual energy audit means a procedure including, but not limited to, 
verification of the achievement of energy cost savings and energy unit 
savings guaranteed resulting from implementation of energy conservation 
measures and determination of whether an adjustment to the energy 
baseline is justified by conditions beyond the contractor's control.
    Building means any closed structure primarily intended for human 
occupancy in which energy is consumed, produced, or distributed.
    Detailed energy survey means a procedure which may include, but is 
not limited to, a detailed analysis of energy cost savings and energy 
unit savings potential, building conditions, energy consuming equipment, 
and hours of use or occupancy for the purpose of confirming or revising 
technical and price proposals based on the preliminary energy survey.

[[Page 424]]

    DOE means Department of Energy.
    Energy baseline means the amount of energy that would be consumed 
annually without implementation of energy conservation measures based on 
historical metered data, engineering calculations, submetering of 
buildings or energy consuming systems, building load simulation models, 
statistical regression analysis, or some combination of these methods.
    Energy conservation measures means measures that are applied to an 
existing Federally owned building or facility that improves energy 
efficiency, are life-cycle cost-effective under subpart A of this part, 
and involve energy conservation, cogeneration facilities, renewable 
energy sources, improvements in operation and maintenance efficiencies, 
or retrofit activities.
    Energy cost savings means a reduction in the cost of energy and 
related operation and maintenance expenses, from a base cost established 
through a methodology set forth in an energy savings performance 
contract, utilized in an existing federally owned building or buildings 
or other federally owned facilities as a result of--
    (1) The lease or purchase of operating equipment, improvements, 
altered operation and maintenance, or technical services; or
    (2) The increased efficient use of existing energy sources by 
cogeneration or heat recovery, excluding any cogeneration process for 
other than a federally owned building or buildings or other federally 
owned facilities.
    Energy savings performance contract means a contract which provides 
for the performance of services for the design, acquisition, 
installation, testing, operation, and, where appropriate, maintenance 
and repair of an identified energy conservation measure or series of 
measures at one or more locations.
    Energy unit savings means the determination, in electrical or 
thermal units (e.g., kilowatt hour (kwh), kilowatt (kw), or British 
thermal units (Btu)), of the reduction in energy use or demand by 
comparing consumption or demand, after completion of contractor-
installed energy conservation measures, to an energy baseline 
established in the contract.
    Facility means any structure not primarily intended for human 
occupancy, or any contiguous group of structures and related systems, 
either of which produces, distributes, or consumes energy.
    Federal agency has the meaning given such term in section 551(1) of 
Title 5, United States Code.
    Preliminary energy survey means a procedure which may include, but 
is not limited to, an evaluation of energy cost savings and energy unit 
savings potential, building conditions, energy consuming equipment, and 
hours of use or occupancy, for the purpose of developing technical and 
price proposals prior to selection.
    Secretary means the Secretary of Energy.

Sec. 436.32  Qualified contractors lists.

    (a) DOE shall prepare a list, to be updated annually, or more often 
as necessary, of firms qualified to provide energy cost savings 
performance services and grouped by technology. The list shall be 
prepared from statements of qualifications by or about firms engaged in 
providing energy savings performance contract services on questionnaires 
obtained from DOE. Such statements shall, at a minimum, include prior 
experience and capabilities of firms to perform the proposed energy cost 
savings services by technology and financial and performance 
information. DOE shall issue a notice annually, for publication in the 
Commerce Business Daily, inviting submission of new statements of 
qualifications and requiring listed firms to update their statements of 
qualifications for changes in the information previously provided.
    (b) On the basis of statements of qualifications received under 
paragraph (a) of this section and any other relevant information, DOE 
shall select a firm for inclusion on the qualified list if--
    (1) It has provided energy savings performance contract services or 
services that save energy or reduce utility costs for not less than two 
clients, and the firm possesses the appropriate project experience to 
successfully implement the technologies which it proposes to provide;

[[Page 425]]

    (2) Previous project clients provide ratings which are ``fair'' or 
better;
    (3) The firm or any principal of the firm has neither been insolvent 
nor declared bankruptcy within the last five years;
    (4) The firm or any principal of the firm is not on the list of 
parties excluded from procurement programs under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 
9.4; and
    (5) There is no other adverse information which warrants the 
conclusion that the firm is not qualified to perform energy savings 
performance contracts.
    (c) DOE may remove a firm from DOE's list of qualified contractors 
after notice and an opportunity for comment if--
    (1) There is a failure to update its statement of qualifications;
    (2) There is credible information warranting disqualification; or
    (3) There is other good cause.
    (d) A Federal agency shall use DOE's list unless it elects to 
develop its own list of qualified firms consistent with the procedures 
in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (e) A firm not designated by DOE or a Federal agency pursuant to the 
procedures in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section as qualified to 
provide energy cost savings performance services shall receive a written 
decision and may request a debriefing.
    (f) Any firm receiving an adverse final decision under this section 
shall apply to the Board of Contract Appeals of the General Services 
Administration in order to exhaust administrative remedies.


<R05>
Sec. 436.33  Procedures and methods for contractor selection.

    (a) Competitive selection. Competitive selections based on 
solicitation of firms are subject to the following procedures--
    (1) With respect to a particular proposed energy cost savings 
performance project, Federal agencies shall publish a Commerce Business 
Daily notice which synopsizes the proposed contract action.
    (2) Each competitive solicitation--
    (i) Shall request technical and price proposals and the text of any 
third-party financing agreement from interested firms;
    (ii) Shall consider DOE model solicitations and should use them to 
the maximum extent practicable;
    (iii) May provide for a two-step selection process which allows 
Federal agencies to make an initial selection based, in part, on 
proposals containing estimated energy cost savings and energy unit 
savings, with contract award conditioned on confirmation through a 
detailed energy survey that the guaranteed energy cost savings are 
within a certain percentage (specified in the solicitation) of the 
estimated amount; and
    (iv) May state that if the Federal agency requires a detailed energy 
survey which identifies life cycle cost effective energy conservation 
measures not in the initial proposal, the contract may include such 
measures.
    (3) Based on its evaluation of the technical and price proposals 
submitted, any applicable financing agreement (including lease-
acquisitions, if any), statements of qualifications submitted under 
Sec. 436.32 of this subpart, and any other information determines to be 
relevant, the Federal agency may select a firm on a qualified list to 
conduct the project.
    (4) If a proposed energy cost savings project involves a large 
facility with too many contiguously related buildings and other 
structures at one site for proposing firms to assume the costs of a 
preliminary energy survey of all such structures, the Federal agency--
    (i) May request technical and price proposals for a representative 
sample of buildings and other structures and may select a firm to 
conduct the proposed project; and
    (ii) After selection of a firm, but prior to award of an energy 
savings performance contract, may request the selected firm to submit 
technical and price proposals for all or some of the remaining buildings 
and other structures at the site and may include in the award for all or 
some of the remaining buildings and other structures.
    (5) After selection under paragraph (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this 
section, but prior to award, a Federal agency may require the selectee 
to conduct a detailed

[[Page 426]]

energy survey to confirm that guaranteed energy cost savings are within 
a certain percentage (specified in the solicitation) of estimated energy 
cost savings in the selectee's proposal. If the detailed energy survey 
does not confirm that guaranteed energy savings are within the fixed 
percentage of estimated savings, the Federal agency may select another 
firm from those within the competitive range.
    (b) Unsolicited proposals. Federal agencies may--
    (1) Consider unsolicited energy savings performance contract 
proposals from firms on a qualified contractor list under this subpart 
which include technical and price proposals and the text of any 
financing agreement (including a lease-acquisition) without regard to 
the requirements of 48 CFR 15.602 and 15.602-2(a)(1); 48 CFR 15.603; and 
48 CFR 15.607(a), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4) and (a)(5).
    (2) Reject an unsolicited proposal that is too narrow because it 
does not address the potential for significant energy conservation 
measures from other than those measures in the proposal.
    (3) After requiring a detailed energy survey, if appropriate, and 
determining that technical and price proposals are adequate, award a 
contract to a firm on a qualified contractor list under this subpart on 
the basis of an unsolicited proposal, provided that the Federal agency 
complies with the following procedures--
    (i) An award may not be made to the firm submitting the unsolicited 
proposal unless the Federal agency first publishes a notice in the 
Commerce Business Daily acknowledging receipt of the proposal and 
inviting other firms on the qualified list to submit competing 
proposals.
    (ii) Except for unsolicited proposals submitted in response to a 
published general statement of agency needs, no award based on such an 
unsolicited proposal may be made in instances in which the Federal 
agency is planning the acquisition of an energy conservation measure 
through an energy savings performance contract.
    (c) Certified cost or pricing data.
    (1) Energy savings performance contracts under this part are firm 
fixed-price contracts.
    (2) Pursuant to the authority provided under section 304A(b)(1)(B) 
of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1049, the 
heads of procuring activities shall waive the requirement for submission 
of certified cost or pricing data. However, this does not exempt 
offerors from submitting information (including pricing information) 
required by the Federal agency to ensure the impartial and comprehensive 
evaluation of proposals.

Sec. 436.34  Multiyear contracts.

    (a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, Federal agencies may 
enter into a multiyear energy savings performance contract for a period 
not to exceed 25 years, as authorized by 42 U.S.C. 8287, without funding 
of cancellation charges, if:
    (1) The multiyear energy savings performance contract was awarded in 
a competitive manner using the procedures and methods established by 
this subpart;
    (2) Funds are available and adequate for payment of the scheduled 
energy cost for the first fiscal year of the multiyear energy savings 
performance contract;
    (3) Thirty days before the award of any multiyear energy savings 
performance contract that contains a clause setting forth a cancellation 
ceiling in excess of $750,000, the head of the awarding Federal agency 
gives written notification of the proposed contract and the proposed 
cancellation ceiling for the contract to the appropriate authorizing and 
appropriating committees of the Congress; and
    (4) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the multiyear 
energy savings performance contract is subject to 48 CFR part 17, 
subpart 17.1, including the requirement that the contracting officer 
establish a cancellation ceiling.
    (b) Neither this subpart nor any provision of the Act requires, 
prior to contract award or as a condition of a contract award, that a 
Federal agency have appropriated funds available and adequate to pay for 
the total costs of an energy savings performance contract for the term 
of such contract.

<R05>
Sec. 436.35  Standard terms and conditions.

    (a) Mandatory requirements. In addition to contractual provisions 
otherwise required by the Act or this subpart, any energy savings 
performance contract shall contain clauses--
    (1) Authorizing modification, replacement, or changes of equipment, 
at no cost to the Federal agency, with the prior approval of the 
contracting officer who shall consider the expected level of performance 
after such modification, replacement or change;
    (2) Providing for the disposition of title to systems and equipment;
    (3) Requiring prior approval by the contracting officer of any 
financing agreements (including lease-acquisitions) and amendments to 
such an agreement entered into after contract award for the purpose of 
financing the acquisition of energy conservation measures;
    (4) Providing for an annual energy audit and identifying who shall 
conduct such an audit, consistent with Sec. 436.37 of this subpart; and
    (5) Providing for a guarantee of energy cost savings to the Federal 
agency, and establishing payment schedules reflecting such guarantee.
    (b) Third party financing. If there is third party financing, then 
an energy savings performance contract may contain a clause:
    (1) Permitting the financing source to perfect a security interest 
in the installed energy conservation measures, subject to and 
subordinate to the rights of the Federal agency; and
    (2) Protecting the interests of a Federal agency and a financing 
source, by authorizing a contracting officer in appropriate 
circumstances to require a contractor who defaults on an energy savings

Sec. 436.100  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of this subpart is to provide guidelines 
for use by Federal agencies in their development of overall 10-year 
energy management plans to establish energy conservation goals, to 
reduce the rate of energy consumption, to promote the efficient use of 
energy, to promote switching for petroleum-based fuels and natural gas 
to coal and other energy sources, to provide a methodology for reporting 
their progress in meeting the goals of those plans, and to promote 
emergency energy conservation planning to assuage the impact of a sudden 
disruption in the supply of oil-based fuels, natural gas or electricity. 
The plan is intended to provide the cornerstone for a program to 
conserve energy in the general operations of an agency.
    (b) Scope. This subpart applies to all general operations of Federal 
agencies and is applicable to management of all energy used by Federal 
agencies that is excluded from coverage pursuant to section 543(a)(2) of 
part 3 of title V of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, as 
amended (42 U.S.C. 8251-8261).

Sec. 436.103  Program goal setting.

    (a) In developing and revising plans for a projected 10-year plan 
each agency shall establish and maintain energy conservation goals in 
accordance with the requirements of this section.
    (b) Agencies shall establish three types of conservation goals:
    (1) Energy consumption goals, by fuel type by functional category 
(see appendix B).
    (2) Energy efficiency goals by fuel type by functional category (see 
appendix B).
    (3) Fuel switching goals for shifting energy use from oil and 
natural gas to other fuels in more plentiful supply from domestic 
sources (see appendix B).
    (c) General operations energy conservation goals shall be 
established by each Federal agency with the broad purpose of achieving 
reductions in total energy consumption and increased efficiency without 
serious mission degradation or unmitigated negative environmental 
impacts. Within the broad framework, each agency should seek first to 
reduce energy consumption per unit of output in each applicable 
functional category. In evaluating energy efficiency, each agency should 
select and use standards of measurement which are consistent throughout 
the planning period. Particular attention should be given to increased 
energy use efficiency in nonrenewable fuel consumption. The second focus 
of attention should be on initiatives which shift energy use from oil 
and natural gas to other fuels in more plentiful supply from domestic 
sources.


<R05>
Sec. 436.104  Energy conservation measures and standards.

    (a) Each agency shall consider for inclusion in its plan the 
measures identified in appendix C of this subpart.
    (b) The following questions should be considered in the evaluation 
of each measure:
    (1) Does this measure provide an incentive or disincentive?
    (2) What is the estimate of savings by fuel type?

[[Page 432]]

    (3) What are the direct and indirect impacts of this measure?
    (4) Is this measure to be mandatory throughout the agency?

Sec. 436.105  Emergency conservation plan.

    (a) Each agency shall establish an emergency conservation plan, a 
summary of which shall be included in the general operations plan, for 
assuaging the impact of a sudden disruption in the supply of oil-based 
fuels, natural gas or electricity. Priorities for temporarily reducing 
missions, production, services, and other programmatic or functional 
activities shall be developed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section. Planning for emergencies is to address both buildings and 
general operations. Provisions shall be made for testing emergency 
actions to ascertain that they are effective.
    (b) Federal agencies shall prepare emergency conservation plans for 
10 percent, fifteen percent, and 20 percent reduction compared to the 
previous fiscal year in gasoline, other oil-based fuels, natural gas, or 
electricity for periods of up to 12 months. In developing these plans, 
agencies shall consider the potential for emergency reductions in energy 
use in buildings and facilities which the agency owns, leases, or has 
under contract and by employees through increased use of car and van 
pooling, preferential parking for multipassenger vehicles, and greater 
use of mass transit. Agencies may formulate whatever additional 
scenarios they consider necessary to plan for various energy 
emergencies.
    (c) In general, Federal agencies' priorities shall go to those 
activities which directly support the agencies' primary missions. 
Secondary mission activities which must be curtailed or deferred will be 
reported to DOE as mission impacts. The description of mission impacts 
shall include estimates of the associated resources and time required to 
mitigate the effects of the reduction in energy. Other factors or 
assumptions to be used in energy conservation emergency planning are as 
follows:
    (1) Agencies will be given 15-30 days notice to implement any given 
plan.
    (2) Substitution of fuels in plentiful supply for fuels in short 
supply is authorized, if the substitution can be completed within a 3-
month period and the cost is within the approval authority of the 
executive branch.
    (3) All costs and increases in manpower or other resources 
associated with activities or projects to assuage mission impacts will 
be clearly defined in respective agency plans. One-time costs will be 
identified separately.
    (4) Confronting the emergency situation will be considered a 
priority effort and all projects and increases in operating budgets 
within the approval authority of the executive branch will be 
expeditiously considered and approved if justified.
    (d) Summary plans for agency-wide emergency conservation management 
shall be provided to DOE pursuant to Sec. 436.102(b)(2)(vi). Such 
summaries shall include:
    (1) Agency-wide impacts of energy reductions as determined in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Actions to be taken agency-wide to alleviate the energy 
shortfalls as they occur.

[[Page 433]]

    (3) An assessment of agency services or production that may need to 
be curtailed or limited after corrective actions have been taken.
    (4) A summation of control and feedback mechanisms for managing an 
energy emergency situation.

   Appendix A to Part 436--Energy Conservation Standards for General 
                          Operations [Reserved]

            Appendix B to Part 436--Goal Setting Methodology

    In establishing and updating agency goals for energy conservation, 
the following methodology or an equivalent method should be utilized:
    (a) For overall energy consumption--
    (1) An analysis shall be made to determine what factors have the 
most significant impact upon the amount of each fuel type used by the 
agency in performing functions in support of its overall mission. 
Consideration is to be given, but not limited to, the following factors: 
Number of people using energy; number of vehicles using gasoline; 
amounts of other equipment using energy; tempo of operations (one, two, 
or three shifts); the type of operations (degree of equipment or labor 
intensity); equipment fuel limitations; environmental conditions 
(tropical versus arctic, etc.); budget levels for fuel, operations, 
maintenance, and equipment acquisition; and phase-out schedule (of older 
equipment or plants which may be inefficient). After identifying these 
factors, a further analysis shall be made to identify any projected 
workload changes in the quality or quantity of these factors on a yearly 
basis up to 1990.
    (2) Based upon the analysis in (a)(1) and an evaluation of available 
information on past energy usage, a baseline of energy use by fuel type 
by functional category shall be established beginning with FY 1975. In 
addition to ``General Transportation,'' other functional categories 
should be selected to enhance energy management. Total fuel use for a 
particular activity may be allocated to the functional category for 
which the preponderance of fuel is used. Figure B-1 is an example of one 
such baseline.

    This example shows an increase in energy use, for a specific fuel 
type, during the period 1975-1981, with a further increase from 1981 to 
1984 and a leveling off and no growth from 1984-1990. A justification, 
based on factors as discussed above, shall accompany each baseline.
    (3) Thereafter, analyses should be made of the measures available 
for reducing the energy consumption profiles without adverse impact on 
mission accomplishment. Finding viable opportunities for reducing energy 
use, increasing energy efficiency and switching energy sources, will 
require consultation with specialists in the fields of operations, 
maintenance, engineering, design, and economics, and consideration of 
the measures identified in Appendix C. The DOE Federal Energy Management 
Programs Office can, upon request, provide information on where such 
resources can be located. Once these measures are identified, they are 
to be incorporated into a time-phased investment program, (using where 
appropriate, the life cycle costing factors and methodology in subpart A 
of this part). If investment and other costs for implementing a measure 
are insignificant, a Federal agency may presume that a measure is cost-
effective without further analysis. An estimate must then be made as to 
the lead time required to implement the program and realize energy 
reductions.
    Figure B-2 shows a summarized investment program, which should be 
accompanied by a detailed description of the measures, projects, and 
programs making up the total planned investments for each year. This 
summary need not be by function or fuel type.

[[Page 436]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.242

    These analyses should enable the agency to project an energy 
consumption goal, with the assumption that funds for executing the 
planned projects will be approved. Figure B-3 shows a new energy use 
profile, with planned initiatives and related investments taken into 
consideration, and the resulting goal entitled ``Energy Use With A 
Plan'' superimposed on Figure B-1. Included are the anticipated effects 
on consumption cause by improvements in energy efficiency and fuel 
switching.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.243

    A comparison of these projections will show the energy use avoidance 
resulting from the investment program as depicted in Figure B-2. Using 
the prices of fuel contained in Appendix C to Subpart A, the dollars 
saved can be projected against the dollars invested. Life cycle costing 
methodology pursuant to subpart A, will be used to determine priorities 
for submitting individual initiatives into the appropriate budget year.
    (b) For energy efficiencies--Energy efficiency baselines and goals 
for each fuel type shall be calculated using the same consumption 
factors and similar methodology to that outlined in paragraph (a). 
Energy consumption by fuel type shall be linked to mission through the 
functional categories listed in Sec. 436.106(a)(2). This will identify a 
rate which will indicate energy efficiency trends. This linkage may be 
accomplished through the following algorithm:

[[Page 437]]

    Step 1: Determine functional categories from section 436.106(a)(2) 
which best describe the Agency overall mission.
    Step 2: Determine types of fuels used to support the functions 
selected in Step 1.
    Step 3: Determine quantities of fuel consumed or planned for 
consumption over a specific period of time.
    Step 4: Determine quantity of output of function for same period of 
time used in Step 3. Quantify output in a standard measure which best 
describes functional category.
    Step 5: Determine the energy efficiency ratio by dividing quantity 
from Step 4 by quantity from Step 3.
    This ratio of fuel consumed to a unit measure of output will be used 
to develop a projection of a baseline and goals through 1990, and used 
in reporting variance. Examples of ratios that should be considered are:

    <bullet> Production or industrial process type operations

Ton of product

Cu. ft. of natural gas

    <bullet> Services, such as postal delivery

Customers served or
pounds delivered

Gallons of automotive
gasoline

    <bullet> General transportation

Passenger miles

Gallons of automotive gasoline

    <bullet> Training

Persons trained
or in training

Gallons of navy special

    Agencies shall select one or more of these ratios, which shall be 
used throughout the planning period, or use more appropriate energy 
efficiency ratios, to describe their overall functions. Figure B-4 
illustrates the planning baseline and goal resulting from this type of 
analysis.

[[Page 438]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.244

    (c) For fuel switching--Fuel switching goals for gasoline other oil-
based fuel and natural gas may be calculated as follows:
    Step 1: For each fiscal year, identify investments, where 
appropriate, in fuel switching

[[Page 439]]

from gasoline, other oil-based fuel and natural gas to alternate 
renewable or nonrenewable fuel sources.
    Step 2: Project for each fiscal year, the avoidance in the use of 
gasoline, other oil-based fuel and natural gas resulting from previous 
fuel switching investments.
    Completion of these steps will permit the formulation of charts such 
as that shown in Figure B-5.

      Appendix D to Part 436--Energy Program Conservation Elements

    (a) In all successful energy conservation programs, certain key 
elements need to be present. The elements listed below must be 
incorporated into each agency conservation program and must be reflected 
in the 10-year plan prescribed in Sec. 436.102. Those organizations that 
have already developed programs should review them to determine whether 
the present management systems incorporate these elements.
    (1) Top Management Control. Top management must have a personal and 
sustained commitment to the program, provide active direction and 
motivation, and require regular review of overall energy usage at senior 
staff meetings.
    (2) Line Management Accountability. Line managers must be 
accountable for the energy conservation performance of their 
organizations and should participate in establishing realistic goals and 
developing strategies and budgets to meet these goals.
    (3) Formal Planning. An overall 10-year plan for the period 1980-
1990 must be developed and formalized which sets forth performance-
oriented conservation goals, including the categorized reduction in 
rates of energy consumption that the program is expected to realize. The 
plan will be supplemented by guidelines enumerating specific 
conservation procedures that will be followed. These procedures and 
initiatives must be life cycle cost-effective as well as energy 
efficient.
    (4) Goals. Goals must be established in a measurable manner to 
answer questions of ``Where are we?'' ``Where do we want to go?'' ``Are 
we getting there?'' and ``Are our initiatives for getting there life 
cycle cost-effective?''
    (5) Monitoring. Progress must be reviewed periodically both at the 
agency headquarters and at local facility levels to identify program 
weakness or additional areas for conservation actions. Progress toward 
achievement of goals should be assessed, and explanations should be 
required for non-achievement or unusual variations in energy use. 
Monitoring should include personal inspections and staff visits, 
management information reporting and audits.
    (6) Using Technical Expertise. Personnel with adequate technical 
background and knowledge of programmatic objectives should be used to 
help management set technical goals and parameters for efficient 
planning and implementation of energy conservation programs. These 
technicians should work in conjunction with the line managers who are 
accountable for both mission accomplishment and energy conservation.
    (7) Employee Awareness. Employees must gain an awareness of energy 
conservation through formal training and employee information programs. 
They should be invited to participate in the process of developing an 
energy conservation program, and to submit definitive suggestions for 
conservation of energy.
    (8) Energy Emergency Planning. Every energy management plan must 
provide for programs to respond to contingencies that may occur at the 
local, state or National level. Programs must be developed for potential 
energy emergency situations calling for reductions of 10 percent, 15 
percent and 20 percent for up to 12 months. Emergency plans must be 
tested to ascertain their effectiveness.
    (9) Budgetary and Fiscal Support. Resources necessary for the energy 
conservation program must be planned and provided for, and the fiscal 
systems adjusted to support energy management investments and 
information reporting.
    (10) Environmental Considerations. Each agency shall fulfill its 
obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act in developing 
its plan.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Subtract 171,258,000 from total program allocations.
    (3) Calculate each State's formula share as follows:
    (i) Divide the number of ``Low Income'' households in each State by 
the number of ``Low Income'' households in the United States and 
multiply by 100.
    (ii) Divide the number of ``Heating Degree Days'' for each State by 
the median ``Heating Degree Days'' for all States.
    (iii) Divide the number of ``Cooling Degree Days'' for each State by 
the median ``Cooling Degree Days'' for all States, then multiply by 0.1.
    (iv) Calculate the sum of the two numbers from paragraph (b)(3)(ii) 
and (iii) of this section.
    (v) Divide the residential energy expenditures for each State by the 
number of households in the State.
    (vi) Divide the sum of the residential energy expenditures for the 
States in each Census division by the sum of the households for the 
States in that division.
    (vii) Divide the quotient from paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section 
by the quotient from paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section.
    (viii) Multiply the quotient from paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this 
section for each State by the residential energy expenditures per low-
income household for its respective Census division.
    (ix) Divide the product from paragraph (b)(3)(viii) of this section 
for each State by the median of the products of all States.

[[Page 446]]

    (x) Multiply the results for paragraph (b)(3)(i), (iv) and (ix) of 
this section for each State.
    (xi) Divide the product in paragraph (b)(3)(x) of this section for 
each State by the sum of the products in paragraph (b)(3)(x) of this 
section for all States.
    (4) Calculate each State's program allocation as follows:
    (i) Multiply the remaining funds calculated in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section by the formula share calculated in paragraph (b)(3)(xi) of 
this section,
    (ii) Add the base allocation from paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
to the product of paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section.
    (c) Should total program allocations for any fiscal year fall below 
the total program allocations under Pub. L. 103- 332, then each State's 
program allocation shall be reduced from its allocated amount under Pub. 
L. 103-332 by the same percentage as total program allocations for the 
fiscal year fall below the total program allocations under Pub. L. 103-
332.
    (d) All data sources used in the development of the formula are 
publicly available. The relevant data is available from the Bureau of 
the Census, the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration 
and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
    (e) Should updates to the data used in the formula become available 
in any fiscal year, these changes would be implemented in the formula in 
the following program year.
    (f) DOE may reduce the program allocation for a State by the amount 
DOE determines cannot be reasonably expended by a grantee to weatherize 
dwelling units during the budget period for which financial assistance 
is to be awarded. In reaching this determination, DOE will consider the 
amount of unexpended financial assistance currently available to a 
grantee under this part and the number of dwelling units which remains 
to be weatherized with the unexpended financial assistance.
    (g) DOE may increase the program allocation of a State by the amount 
DOE determines the grantee can expend to weatherize additional dwelling 
units during the budget period for which financial assistance is to be 
awarded.
    (h) The Support Office Director shall notify each State of the 
program allocation for which that State is eligible to apply.

Sec. 440.11  Native Americans.

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Support 
Office Director may determine, after taking into account the amount of 
funds made available to a State to carry out the purposes of this part, 
that:
    (1) The low-income members of an Indian tribe are not receiving 
benefits under this part equivalent to the assistance provided to other 
low-income persons in the State under this part and
    (2) The low-income members of such tribe would be better served by 
means of a grant made directly to provide such assistance.
    (b) In any State for which the Support Office Director shall have 
made the determination referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
Support Office Director shall reserve from the sums that would otherwise 
be allocated to the State under this part not less than 100 percent, or 
more than 150 percent, of an amount which bears the same ratio to the 
State's allocation for the fiscal year involved as the population of all 
low-income Native Americans for whom a determination under paragraph (a) 
of this section has been made bears to the population of all low-income 
persons in the State.
    (c) The Support Office Director shall make the determination 
prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section in the event a State:
    (1) Does not apply within the sixty-day time period prescribed in 
Sec. 440.12(a);
    (2) Recommends that direct grants be made for low-income members of 
an Indian tribe as provided in Sec. 440.12(b)(5);
    (3) Files an application which DOE determines, in accordance with 
the procedures in Sec. 440.30, not to make adequate provision for the 
low-income members of an Indian tribe residing in the State; or
    (4) Has received grant funds and DOE determines, in accordance with 
the procedures in Sec. 440.30, that the State

[[Page 447]]

has failed to implement the procedures required by Sec. 440.16(6).
    (d) Any sums reserved by the Support Office Director pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section shall be granted to the tribal 
organization serving the individuals for whom the determination has been 
made, or where there is no tribal organization, to such other entity as 
the Support Office Director determines is able to provide adequate 
weatherization assistance pursuant to this part. Where the Support 
Office Director intends to make a grant to an organization to perform 
services benefiting more than one Indian tribe, the approval of each 
Indian tribe shall be a prerequisite for the issuance of a notice of 
grant award.
    (e) Within 30 days after the Support Office Director has reserved 
funds pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Support Office 
Director shall give written notice to the tribal organization or other 
qualified entity of the amount of funds reserved and its eligibility to 
apply therefor.
    (f) Such tribal organization or other qualified entity shall 
thereafter be treated as a unit of general purpose local government 
eligible to apply for funds hereunder, pursuant to the provisions of 
Sec. 440.13.

    (b) The $2,500 average will be adjusted annually by DOE beginning in 
calendar year 2000 by increasing the limitation by an amount equal to:
    (1) The limitation amount for the previous year, multiplied by
    (2) The lesser of:
    (i) The percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (all items, 
United States city average) for the most recent calendar year completed 
before the beginning of the year for which the determination is being 
made, or
    (ii) Three percent.
    (3) For the purposes of determining the average cost per dwelling 
limitation, costs for the purchase of vehicles or other certain types of 
equipment as defined in 10 CFR part 600 may be amortized over the useful 
life of the vehicle or equipment.
    (c) Allowable expenditures under this part include only:
    (1) The cost of purchase and delivery of weatherization materials;
    (2) Labor costs, in accordance with Sec. 440.19;

<R05>
Sec. 440.21  Weatherization materials standards and energy audit procedures.

    (a) Paragraph (b) of this section describes the required standards 
for weatherization materials. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section 
describe the cost-effectiveness tests that weatherization materials must 
pass before they

[[Page 453]]

may be installed in an eligible dwelling unit. Paragraph (e) of this 
section lists the other energy audit requirements that do not pertain to 
cost-effectiveness tests of weatherization materials. Paragraphs (f) and 
(g) of this section describe the use of priority lists and presumptively 
cost-effective general heat waste reduction materials as part of a 
State's energy audit procedures. Paragraph (h) of this section explains 
that a State's energy audit procedures and priority lists must be re-
approved by DOE every 5 years.
    (b) Only weatherization materials which are listed in Appendix A to 
this part and which meet or exceed standards prescribed in Appendix A to 
this part may be purchased with funds provided under this part. However, 
DOE may approve an unlisted material upon application from any State.
    (c) Except for materials to eliminate health and safety hazards 
allowable under Sec. 440.18(c)(15), each individual weatherization 
material and package of weatherization materials installed in an 
eligible dwelling unit must be cost-effective. These materials must 
result in energy cost savings over the lifetime of the measure(s), 
discounted to present value, that equal or exceed the cost of materials, 
installation, and on-site supervisory personnel as defined by the 
Department. States have the option of requiring additional related costs 
to be included in the determination of cost-effectiveness. The cost of 
incidental repairs must be included in the cost of the package of 
measures installed in a dwelling.
    (d) The energy audit procedures must assign priorities among 
individual weatherization materials in descending order of their cost-
effectiveness according to paragraph (c) of this section after:
    (1) Adjusting for interaction between architectural and mechanical 
weatherization materials by using generally accepted engineering methods 
to decrease the estimated fuel cost savings for a lower priority 
weatherization material in light of fuel cost savings for a related 
higher priority weatherization material; and
    (2) Eliminating any weatherization materials that are no longer 
cost-effective, as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (e) The energy audit procedures also must--
    (1) Compute the cost of fuel saved per year by taking into account 
the climatic data of the area where the dwelling unit is located, where 
the base temperature that determines the number of heating or cooling 
degree days (if used) reasonably approximates conditions when operation 
of heating and cooling equipment is required to maintain comfort, and 
must otherwise use reasonable energy estimating methods and assumptions;
    (2) Determine existing energy use and energy requirements of the 
dwelling unit from actual energy bills or by generally accepted 
engineering calculations;
    (3) Address significant heating and cooling needs;
    (4) Make provision for the use of advanced diagnostic and assessment 
techniques which DOE has determined are consistent with sound 
engineering practices;
    (5) Identify health and safety hazards to be abated with DOE funds 
in compliance with the State's DOE-approved health and safety procedures 
under Sec. 440.16(h);
    (6) Treat the dwelling unit as a whole system by examining its 
heating and cooling system, its air exchange system, and its occupants' 
living habits and needs, and making necessary adjustments to the 
priority of weatherization materials with adequate documentation of the 
reasons for such an adjustment; and
    (7) Be specifically approved by DOE for use on each major dwelling 
type that represents a significant portion of the State's weatherization 
program in light of the varying energy audit requirements of different 
dwelling types including single-family dwellings, multi-family 
buildings, and mobile homes.
    (f) For similar dwelling units without unusual energy-consuming 
characteristics, energy audits may be accomplished by using a priority 
list developed by conducting, in compliance with paragraphs (b) through 
(e) of this section, site-specific energy audits of a representative 
subset of these dwelling

[[Page 454]]

units. For DOE approval, States must describe how the priority list was 
developed, how the subset of similar homes was determined, and 
circumstances that will require site-specific audits rather than the use 
of the priority lists. States also must provide the input data and list 
of weatherization measures recommended by the energy audit software or 
manual methods for several dwelling units from the subset of similar 
units.
    (g) States may use, as a part of an energy audit, general heat waste 
reduction weatherization materials that DOE has determined to be 
generally cost-effective. States may request approval to use general 
heat waste materials not listed in DOE policy guidance by providing 
documentation of their cost-effectiveness and a description of the 
circumstances under which such materials will be used.
    (h) States must resubmit their energy audit procedures (and priority 
lists, if applicable, under certain conditions) to DOE for approval 
every five years. States must also resubmit to DOE, for approval every 
five years, their list of general heat waste materials in addition to 
those approved by DOE in policy guidance, if applicable. Policy guidance 
will describe the information States must submit to DOE and the 
circumstances that reduce or increase documentation requirements.

    (2) Which contains a member who has received cash assistance 
payments under Title IV or XVI of the Social Security Act or applicable 
State or local law at any time during the 12-month period preceding the 
determination of eligibility for weatherization assistance; or
    (3) If the State elects, is eligible for assistance under the Low-
Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981, provided that such basis is 
at least 125 percent of the poverty level determined in accordance with 
criteria established by the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget.
    (b) A subgrantee may weatherize a building containing rental 
dwelling units using financial assistance for dwelling units eligible 
for weatherization assistance under paragraph (a) of this section, 
where:
    (1) The subgrantee has obtained the written permission of the owner 
or his agent;
    (2) Not less than 66 percent (50 percent for duplexes and four-unit 
buildings, and certain eligible types of large multi-family buildings) 
of the dwelling units in the building:
    (i) Are eligible dwelling units, or
    (ii) Will become eligible dwelling units within 180 days under a 
Federal, State, or local government program for rehabilitating the 
building or making similar improvements to the building; and
    (3) The grantee has established procedures for dwellings which 
consist of a rental unit or rental units to ensure that:
    (i) The benefits of weatherization assistance in connection with 
such rental units, including units where the tenants pay for their 
energy through their rent, will accrue primarily to the low-income 
tenants residing in such units;
    (ii) For a reasonable period of time after weatherization work has 
been completed on a dwelling containing a unit occupied by an eligible 
household, the tenants in that unit (including households paying for 
their energy through their rent) will not be subjected to rent increases 
unless those increases are demonstrably related to matters other than 
the weatherization work performed;
    (iii) The enforcement of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section is 
provided through procedures established by the State by which tenants 
may file complaints, and owners, in response to such complaints, shall 
demonstrate that the rent increase concerned is related to matters other 
than the weatherization work performed; and
    (iv) No undue or excessive enhancement shall occur to the value of 
the dwelling units.

[[Page 455]]

    (c) In order to secure the Federal investment made under this part 
and address the issues of eviction from and sale of property receiving 
weatherization materials under this part, States may seek landlord 
agreement to placement of a lien or to other contractual restrictions;
    (d) As a condition of having assistance provided under this part 
with respect to multifamily buildings, a State may require financial 
participation, when feasible, from the owners of such buildings. Such 
financial participation shall not be reported as program income, nor 
will it be treated as if it were appropriated funds. The funds 
contributed by the landlord shall be expended in accordance with the 
agreement between the landlord and the weatherization agency.
    (e) In devising procedures under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this 
section, States should consider requiring use of alternative dispute 
resolution procedures including arbitration.
    (f) A State may weatherize shelters. For the purpose of determining 
how many dwelling units exist in a shelter, a grantee may count each 800 
square feet of the shelter as a dwelling unit or it may count each floor 
of the shelter as a dwelling unit.

Internal Revenue Code of 1986, except that in applying such provisions 
calendar year 1993 shall be substituted for calendar year 1979.
    (e) Insufficient Funds. The Assistant Secretary for Energy 
Efficiency and Renewable Energy shall determine the extent to which 
appropriated funds are available to be obligated under this program for 
each fiscal year. If funds determined to be available under the 
preceding sentence are not sufficient to make full incentive payments 
for all approved applications, DOE shall--
    (1) Make incentive payments first, and if necessary on a pro rata 
basis, to owners or operators of qualified renewable energy facilities 
using solar, wind, geothermal, and closed-loop biomass technologies;
    (2) Make incentive payments second, and if necessary on a pro rata 
basis, to owners or operators of all other qualified renewable energy 
facilities.
    (3) Treat the number of kilowatt-hours for which an incentive 
payment is not made as a result of insufficient appropriations as 
accrued energy for

[[Page 466]]

which subsequent application for incentive payment may be made.
    (f) Notice to applicant. After calculating the amount of the 
incentive payment under paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section, the 
DOE Deciding Official shall then issue a written notice of the 
determination to the applicant--
    (1) Approving the application as eligible for payment and forwarding 
a copy to the DOE Finance Office with a request to pay;
    (2) Setting forth the calculation of the approved amount of the 
incentive payment; and
    (3) Stating the amount of accrued energy, measured in kilowatt-
hours, for each qualified renewable energy facility, if any, and the 
energy source for same.
    (g) Disqualification. If the application does not meet the 
requirements of this part or some of the kilowatt-hours claimed in the 
application are disallowed as unqualified, the Deciding Official shall 
issue a written notice denying the application in whole or in part with 
an explanation of the basis for denial.


<R05>
Sec. 451.10  Administrative appeals.

    (a) In order to exhaust administrative remedies, an applicant who 
receives a notice denying an application in whole or in part shall 
appeal, on or before 45 days from date of the notice issued by the DOE 
Deciding Official, to the Office of Hearings and Appeals, 1000 
Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20585, in accordance with 
the procedures set forth in subpart C of 10 CFR part 1003.
    (b) If an applicant does not appeal under paragraph (a) of this 
section, the determination of the DOE Deciding Official shall become 
final for DOE and judicially unreviewable.
    (c) If an applicant appeals on a timely basis under paragraph (a) of 
this section, the decision and order of the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals shall be final for DOE.
    (d) If the Office of Hearings and Appeals orders an incentive 
payment, the DOE Deciding Official shall send a copy of such order to 
the DOE Finance Office with a request to pay.

included in current energy prices or when the technical assistance 
report recommends an energy conservation measure that shifts energy 
usage to periods of lower demand and cost; and
    (6) A signed and dated certification that the technical assistance 
program has been conducted in accordance with the requirements of this 
section and that the data presented is accurate to the best of the 
technical assistance analyst's knowledge.


<R05>
Sec. 455.63  Cost-effectiveness testing.

    (a) This paragraph applies to calculation of the simple payback 
period of energy conservation measures.
    (1) The simple payback period of each energy conservation measure 
(except measures to shift demand, or renewable resource measures) shall 
be calculated, taking into account the interactions among the various 
measures, by dividing the estimated total cost of the measure, as 
determined pursuant to Sec. 455.62(d)(3)(ii), by the estimated annual 
cost savings accruing from the

[[Page 481]]

measure (adjusted for demand charges), as determined pursuant to 
Sec. 455.62(d)(3)(vi), provided that:
    (i) At least 50 percent of the annual cost savings used in this 
calculation shall be from the cost of the energy to be saved or a higher 
percent if required by a State in its State Plan pursuant to 
Sec. 455.20(u)(3); and
    (ii) No more than 50 percent of the annual cost savings used in this 
calculation shall be from other cost savings, such as those resulting 
from energy conservation maintenance and operating procedures related to 
particular energy conservation measures, or from changes in type of fuel 
used, or a lower percent if required by a State in its State Plan 
pursuant to Sec. 455.20(u)(3).
    (2) The simple payback period of each renewable resource energy 
conservation measure shall be calculated, taking into account the 
interactions among the various measures, by dividing the estimated total 
cost of the measure, as determined pursuant to Sec. 455.62(d)(3)(ii), by 
the estimated annual cost savings accruing from the measure taking into 
account at least the annual cost of the non-renewable fuels displaced 
less the annual cost of the renewable fuel, if any, and the annual cost 
of any backup non-renewable fuel needed to operate the system, adjusted 
for demand charges, as determined pursuant to Sec. 455.62(d)(3)(vi).
    (3) The simple payback period of each energy conservation measure 
designed to shift demand to a period of lower demand and lower cost 
shall be calculated, taking into account the interactions among the 
various measures, by dividing the estimated total cost of the measure, 
as determined pursuant to Sec. 455.62(d)(3)(ii), by the estimated annual 
cost savings accruing from the measure taking into account at least the 
annual cost of the energy used before the measure is installed less the 
estimated annual cost of the energy to be used after the measure is 
installed, adjusted for demand charges, as determined pursuant to 
Sec. 455.62(d)(3)(vi).
    (b) This paragraph applies, in addition to paragraph (a) of this 
section, if the State plan requires the cost effectiveness of an energy 
conservation measure to be determined by life-cycle cost analysis or if 
the applicant requests such an analysis.
    (1) A life-cycle cost analysis, showing a savings-to-investment 
ratio greater than or equal to one over the useful life of the energy 
conservation measure or 15 years, whichever is less, shall be conducted 
in accordance with the requirements set forth in the State Plan pursuant 
to Secs. 455.20(u)(2), 455.20(u)(3) and Sec. 455.64.
    (2) The resulting savings-to-investment ratio shall be used for the 
purpose of ranking applications.


<R05>
Sec. 455.64  Life-cycle cost methodology.

    (a) The life-cycle cost methodology under Sec. 455.63(b) of this 
part is a systematic comparison of the relevant significant cost savings 
and costs associated with an energy conservation measure over its 
expected useful life, or other appropriate study period with future cost 
savings and costs discounted to present value. The format for displaying 
life-cycle costs shall be a savings-to-investment ratio.
    (b) An energy conservation measure must be cost effective, and its 
savings-to-investment ratio must be greater than or equal to one no 
earlier than the end of the second year of the study period.
    (c) A savings-to-investment ratio is the ratio of the present value 
of net cost savings attributable to an energy conservation measure to 
the present value of the net increase in investment, maintenance and 
operating, and replacement costs less salvage value or disposal cost 
attributable to that measure over a study period.
    (d) Except for energy conservation measures to shift demand or to 
use renewable energy resources, the numerator of the savings-to-
investment ratio shall include net cost savings, appropriately 
discounted and adjusted for energy cost escalation consistent with 
paragraph (g) of this section, subject to the limitation that the cost 
of the energy to be saved shall constitute at least 50 percent of the 
net cost savings unless the State specifies a higher percent in its 
State plan pursuant to Sec. 455.20(u)(3).
    (e) With respect to energy conservation measures to shift demand or 
to use renewable energy resources, the

[[Page 482]]

numerator of the savings-to-investment ratio shall be net cost savings 
appropriately discounted and adjusted for energy cost escalation 
consistent with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (f) The study period for a life-cycle cost analysis, which may not 
exceed 15 years, shall be the useful life of the energy conservation 
measure or of the energy conservation measure with the longest life (for 
purposes of ranking buildings with multiple energy conservation 
measures).
    (g) The discount rate must equal or exceed the discount rate 
annually provided by DOE under 10 CFR part 436. The energy cost 
escalation rates must not exceed those annually provided by DOE under 10 
CFR part 436.
    (h) Investment costs may be assumed to be a lump sum occurring at 
the beginning of the base year, or to the extent that there are future 
investment costs, discounted to present value.
    (i) The cost of energy and maintenance and operating costs may be 
assumed to begin to accrue at the beginning of the base year or when 
they are actually projected to occur.
    (j) It may be assumed that costs occur in a lump sum at any time 
within the year in which they are incurred.

partially credit the costs of the following, with respect to a building, 
toward the required cost-share for an energy conservation measure grant 
in that building:
    (a) A non-Federally funded technical assistance program;
    (b) A non-Federally funded technical assistance program update to 
comply with Sec. 455.20(q); and
    (c) The non-Federally funded implementation of one or more energy 
conservation measures, which complies with the eligibility criteria set 
forth in Sec. 455.71.


<R05>
Sec. 455.103  Requirements for applications for credit.

    (a) If a State has provided for credit in its State Plan pursuant to 
Sec. 455.20(w), applications for credit will be considered only when the 
technical assistance programs or updates and the energy conservation 
measure projects for which credit is sought meet the applicable program 
requirements, such as those specified in Sec. 455.61, Sec. 455.62, 
Sec. 455.71, and the relevant sections of 10 CFR part 600, except that 
the project need not comply with the Davis-Bacon Act regarding labor 
standards or wage rates.
    (b) Credit for energy conservation measures will be considered only 
when supported by a technical assistance analysis that meets the 
requirements of Sec. 455.62 and that was performed prior to the 
installation of the energy conservation measures.


<R05>
Sec. 455.104  Rebates from utilities and other entities.

    (a) Grantees which receive rebates or other monetary considerations 
from utilities or other entities for installing the energy conservation 
measures funded by a grant under this part may use such funds to meet 
their cost- sharing obligations pursuant to Sec. 455.100.
    (b) Where the rebate or monetary consideration does not exceed the 
non-Federal share of the cost of the measures applied for in a grant 
application, grantees are not required to deduct the amount of the 
rebate or monetary consideration from the cost of the measures, and DOE 
does not consider such rebates or monetary considerations to be program 
income which would have to be remitted to DOE upon receipt by the 
grantee.
    (c) Where the rebate or monetary consideration does exceed the non-
Federal share of the cost of the measures applied for in a grant 
application,

[[Page 485]]

grantees may use the excess to fund additional measures if such measures 
have been recommended in the technical assistance report. If it is not 
possible to use the excess funding in this way, the grantee must reduce 
the cost--and DOE will reduce the Federal share--by the amount of the 
excess above the non-Federal share.

administrative expenses shall file an application in accordance with the 
provisions of this section.
    (a) Where a State is operating a program solely to provide grants to 
schools and hospitals, the maximum amount of administrative expenses the 
State may apply for is $50,000 or 5 percent of the Federal share of its 
schools and hospitals grant awards, whichever is greater.
    (1) At any time after notice by DOE of the amounts allocated to each 
State for a grant program cycle, each State may apply to DOE for an 
amount for administrative expenses not exceeding $50,000.
    (2) After making a submittal to DOE as required under Sec. 455.133, 
each State may apply for a further grant not exceeding 5 percent of the 
total Federal share of all grant awards for technical assistance and 
energy conservation measures within the State, less the $50,000 provided 
for in paragraph (a)(l) of this section if that was previously awarded 
to the State for administrative expenses in the same grant program 
cycle.
    (b) Where a State is eligible and elects to apply to use its 
appropriated allocation for grants for technical assistance, program 
assistance, and/or marketing pursuant to Sec. 455.121, the maximum 
amount of administrative expenses the State may apply for is $50,000 or 
5 percent of the total amount obligated or legally committed to eligible 
recipients in the State pursuant to the State's program under this part, 
whichever is greater.
    (1) At any time after notice by DOE of amounts allocated to each 
State for a grant program cycle, each State may apply to DOE for an 
amount for administrative expenses not exceeding $50,000.
    (2) Once the total amount obligated or legally committed to the 
program in the cycle is known, a State may subsequently apply for a 
further grant, not exceeding 5 percent of the total amount (less the 
$50,000 provided for in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if that was 
previously awarded to the State for administrative expenses in the same 
fiscal year) obligated or legally committed to eligible recipients in 
the State during the fiscal year for technical assistance, program 
assistance, and marketing, and for energy conservation measures which 
are funded with non-Federal funds but which meet the certification and 
other requirements of this part for such energy conservation measures.
    (3) The aggregate amount applied for to cover State administrative 
expenses, technical assistance, program assistance, and marketing cannot 
exceed the State's allocation for the fiscal year.
    (c) In the event that a State cannot, or decides not to use the 
amount available to it for an administrative grant under this section 
for administrative purposes, these funds may, at the discretion of the 
State, be used for technical assistance and energy conservation measure 
grants to eligible institutions within that State in accordance with 
this part.
    (d) Applications for financial assistance to defray State 
administrative expenses shall include:
    (1) The name and address of the person designated by the State to be 
responsible for the State's functions under this part;
    (2) An identification of intended use of all Federal and non-Federal 
funds to be used for the State administrative expenses listed in

Sec. 455.130  State evaluation of grant applications.

    (a) If an application received by a State is reviewed and evaluated 
by that State and determined to be in compliance with subparts E, F, and 
J of this part, Sec. 455.130(b), any additional requirements of the 
approved State Plan, State environmental laws, and other applicable laws 
and regulations, then such application will be eligible for financial 
assistance.
    (b) Concurrent with its evaluation and ranking of grant applications 
pursuant to Sec. 455.131, the State will forward applications for 
technical assistance or for energy conservation measures for schools to 
the State school facilities agency for review and certification that 
each school application is consistent with related State programs for 
educational facilities. For hospitals the certification requirement 
applies only if there is a State requirement for it in which case the 
procedure should be described in the State Plan.


<R05>
Sec. 455.131  State ranking of grant applications.

    (a) Except as provided by Sec. 455.92 of this part, all eligible 
applications received by the State will be ranked by the State in 
accordance with its approved State Plan.
    (b) For technical assistance programs, buildings shall be ranked in 
descending priority based upon the energy conservation potential, on a 
savings percentage basis, of the building as determined in the energy 
audit or energy use evaluation pursuant to Sec. 455.20(k). Each State 
shall develop separate rankings for all buildings covered by eligible 
applications for:

[[Page 491]]

    (1) Technical assistance programs for units of local government and 
public care institutions and
    (2) Technical assistance programs for schools and hospitals.
    (c) All eligible applications for energy conservation measures 
received will be ranked by the State on building-by-building or a 
measure-by-measure basis. If a State ranks on a building-by-building 
basis, several buildings may be ranked as a single building if the 
application proposes a single energy conservation measure which is 
physically connected to all of the buildings. If a State ranks on a 
measure-by-measure basis, a measure that is physically connected to a 
number of buildings may be ranked as a single measure. Buildings or 
measures shall be ranked in accordance with the procedures established 
by the State Plan on the basis of the information developed during a 
technical assistance program (or its equivalent) for the building and 
the criteria for ranking applications. The criterion set forth in 
paragraph (1) of this subsection shall receive at least 50 percent of 
the weight given to the criteria used to rank applications. Each State 
may assign weights to the other criteria as set forth in the State Plan 
pursuant to Sec. 455.20(e). The criteria for ranking applications are:
    (1) Simple payback or a life-cycle cost analysis, calculated in 
accordance with Sec. 455.63 and Sec. 455.64, as applicable;
    (2) The types and quantities of energy to be saved, including oil, 
natural gas, or electricity, in a priority as established in the 
approved State Plan;
    (3) The types of energy sources to which conversion is proposed, 
including renewable energy;
    (4) The quality of the technical assistance program report; and
    (5) Other factors as determined by the State.
    (d) A State is exempt from the ranking requirements of this section 
when:
    (1) The total amount requested by all applications for schools and 
hospitals for technical assistance and energy conservation measures in a 
given grant program cycle for grants up to 50 percent is less than or 
equal to the funds available to the State for such grants and the total 
amount recommended for hardship funding is less than or equal to the 
amounts available to the State for such grants and
    (2) The total amount requested by all applications for buildings 
owned by units of local government and public care institutions in a 
given grant program cycle is less than or equal to the total amount 
allocated to the State for technical assistance program grants in the 
State;
    (e) If a State elects to permit applications for credit pursuant to 
Sec. 455.102, such applications for completed or partially completed 
energy conservation measures shall reflect both the work done and the 
work to be done and will be reviewed and ranked on the basis of the cost 
of all of the measures in the project. The credit shall not exceed the 
non-Federal share of the proposed additional energy conservation 
measures (and the Federal share shall not exceed the cost of the work 
remaining to be done).
    (f) Within the rankings of school and hospital buildings for 
technical assistance and energy conservation measures including 
renewable resource measures to the extent that approvable applications 
are submitted, a State shall initially assure that:
    (1) Schools receive at least 30 percent of the total funds allocated 
for schools and hospitals to the State in any grant program cycle and
    (2) Hospitals receive at least 30 percent of the total funds 
allocated for schools and hospitals to the State in any grant program 
cycle.
    (g) If there are insufficient applications from schools or hospitals 
to cover the respective 30 percent requirements specified in paragraph 
(f) of this section, then the State may recommend use of the remaining 
funds in those allocations for other qualified applicants.


<R05>
Sec. 455.132  State evaluation of requests for severe hardship assistance.

    (a) To the extent provided in Sec. 455.30(d), financial assistance 
will be initially available for schools and hospitals experiencing 
severe hardship based upon an applicant's inability to provide the non-
Federal share as specified in the State plan pursuant to Sec. 455.20(g). 
This financial assistance will

[[Page 492]]

be available only to the extent necessary to enable such institutions to 
participate in the program.
    (b) The State shall recommend funds for severe hardship applications 
wholly or partially from the funds reserved in accordance with 
Sec. 455.30(d) and as stated in an approved State Plan.
    (c) Applications for Federal funding in excess of the non-Federal 
share in the State plan pursuant to Sec. 455.20(x) based on claims of 
severe hardship shall be given an additional evaluation by the State to 
assess on a quantifiable basis to the maximum extent practicable the 
relative need among eligible institutions. The minimum amount of 
additional Federal funding necessary for the applicant to participate in 
the program will be determined by the State in accordance with the 
procedures established in the State Plan. The primary consideration 
shall be the institution's inability to provide the non-Federal share of 
the project cost as specified in the State plan pursuant to 
Sec. 455.20(x). Secondary criteria such as climate, fuel cost and fuel 
availability, borrowing capacity, median family income in the area, and 
other relevant factors as determined by the State may be addressed in 
the State Plan as specified in Sec. 455.20(g).
    (d) A State shall indicate, for those schools and hospitals with the 
highest rankings, determined pursuant to Sec. 455.131(b) and (c):
    (1) The amount of additional hardship funding requested by each 
eligible applicant for each building determined to be in a class of 
severe hardship and
    (2) The amount of hardship funding recommended by the State based 
upon relative need, as determined in accordance with the State Plan, to 
the limit of the hardship funds available. The State must decide on a 
case-by-case basis whether, and to what extent, it will recommend 
hardship funding.
    (e) If there are insufficient applications from hardship applicants 
to cover the 10 percent allocation provided for in Sec. 455.30(d), then 
the State may recommend use of the remaining funds for other qualified 
applicants. The total amount recommended for hardship grants cannot 
exceed the 10 percent limit.


<R05>
Sec. 455.133  Forwarding of applications from institutions and coordinating agencies for technical assistance and energy conservation measure grants.

    (a) Except as provided by Sec. 455.92 of this part, each State shall 
forward all applications recommended for funding within its allocation 
to DOE once each program cycle along with a listing of buildings or 
measures covered by eligible applications for schools, hospitals, units 
of local government, and public care institutions ranked by the State if 
necessary pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 455.131. If ranking has 
been employed, the list shall include the standings of buildings or 
measures.
    (1) Measure-by-measure rankings will be recombined for the 
respective buildings with more than one recommended measure and
    (2) Buildings will be consolidated under one grantee application.
    (b) The State shall indicate the amount of financial assistance 
requested by the applicant for each eligible building and, for those 
buildings recommended for funding within the limits of the State's 
allocation, the amount recommended for funding. If the amount 
recommended is less than the amount requested by the applicant, the list 
shall also indicate the reason for that recommendation.
    (c) The State shall indicate that it has reviewed and evaluated all 
of the submitted applications and that those applications meet the 
relevant requirements of the program, and shall certify that 
applications submitted are eligible pursuant to Sec. 455.130(a).


<R05>
Sec. 455.134  Forwarding of applications for State grants for technical assistance, program assistance, and marketing.

    A State eligible to apply for grants for technical assistance, 
program assistance, or marketing, as described in Sec. 455.121, may 
submit such an application to DOE any time after the allocations have 
been announced as part of, or in lieu of, an application for a grant for 
State administrative expenses. Such applications shall provide separate 
narrative descriptions, budgets and appropriate milestone dates, 
covering each activity or program, that

[[Page 493]]

are sufficiently detailed to enable DOE to reasonably evaluate the 
application.


<R05>
Sec. 455.135  State liaison, monitoring, and reporting.

    Each State shall be responsible for:
    (a) Consulting with eligible institutions and coordinating agencies 
representing such institutions in the development of its State Plan;
    (b) Notifying eligible institutions and coordinating agencies of the 
content of the approved State Plan and any amendment to a State Plan;
    (c) Notifying each applicant how the applicant's building or measure 
ranked among other applications, and whether and to what extent its 
application will be recommended for funding or if not to be recommended 
for funding, the specific reasons(s) therefor;
    (d) Certifying that each institution has given its assurance that it 
is willing and able to participate on the basis of any changes in 
amounts recommended for that institution in the State ranking pursuant 
to Sec. 455.131;
    (e) Reporting requirements pursuant to Sec. 455.113; and
    (f) Direct program oversight and monitoring of the activities for 
which grants are awarded as defined in the State Plan. States shall 
immediately notify DOE of any noncompliance or indication thereof.

Sec. 455.140  Approval of applications from institutions and coordinating agencies for technical assistance and energy conservation measures.

    (a) DOE shall review and approve applications submitted by a State 
in accordance with Sec. 455.133 if DOE determines that the applications 
meet the objectives of the Act, and comply with the applicable State 
Plan and the requirements of this part. DOE may disapprove all or any 
portion of an application to the extent funds are not available to carry 
out a program or measure (or portion thereof) contained in the 
application, or for such other reason as DOE may deem appropriate.
    (b) DOE shall notify a State and the applicant of the final approval 
or disapproval of an application at the earliest practicable date after 
the DOE receipt of the application, and, in the event of disapproval, 
shall include a statement of the reasons therefor.
    (c) An application which has been disapproved for reasons other than 
lack of funds may be amended to correct the cause of its disapproval and 
resubmitted in the same manner as the original application at any time 
within the same grant program cycle. Such an application will be 
considered to the extent funds have not already been designated for 
applicants by the ranking process at the time of resubmittal. However, 
nothing in this provision shall obligate either the State or DOE to take 
final action regarding a resubmitted application within the grant 
program cycle. An application not acted upon may be resubmitted in a 
subsequent grant program cycle.
    (d) DOE shall not provide supplemental funds to cover cost overruns 
or other additional costs beyond those provided for in the original 
grant award for technical assistance projects and shall fund only one 
technical assistance project per building.
    (e) DOE shall not provide supplemental funds to cover cost overruns 
or other additional costs beyond those provided for in the original 
grant award for energy conservation measures funded under a grant in a 
given grant program cycle. DOE shall not provide funds to cover energy 
conservation measures intended to replace energy conservation measures 
funded in an earlier grant cycle unless the State has funds remaining 
after all applications for new energy conservation measures have been 
evaluated and submitted to DOE for funding.
    (f) If provided for in the State Plan, an applicant may reapply for 
a technical assistance program or an energy conservation measure grant 
which was included in a prior grant application but which was not 
implemented and for which no funds were expended.
    (g) An applicant may apply for, and DOE may make, grant awards in 
another grant program cycle for additional energy conservation measures 
which relate to a building which previously received grants for other 
energy conservation measures.
    (h) Funds which become available to a grantee after the installation 
of all

[[Page 494]]

approved measures, due to cost underruns in the installed measures, may 
be used by the grantee for additional measures if such measures are 
approved in writing by the State and DOE.
    (i) DOE may fund costs incurred by an applicant for technical 
assistance and energy conservation measure projects after the date of 
the grant application, so long as that date is no earlier than the close 
of the preceding grant program cycle. Such costs may be funded when, in 
the judgment of DOE, the applicant has complied with program 
requirements and the costs incurred are allowable under applicable cost 
principles and the approved project budget. The applicant bears the 
responsibility for the entire project cost unless the application is 
approved by DOE in accordance with this part.
    (j) In addition to the prior approval requirements for project 
changes as specified in the DOE Financial Assistance Rules (10 CFR part 
600), a grantee shall request prior written approval from DOE before:
    (1) Transferring DOE or matching amounts between buildings included 
in an approved application when the State ranks applications on a 
building-by-building basis or
    (2) Transferring DOE or matching amounts between energy conservation 
measures included in an approved application when the State ranks on a 
measure-by-measure basis.

    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 32901 et seq.

    Source: 65 FR 36991, June 12, 2000, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 474.1  Purpose and Scope.

    This part contains procedures for calculating a value for the 
petroleum-equivalent fuel economy of electric vehicles, as required by 
49 U.S.C. 32904(a)(2). The petroleum-equivalent fuel economy value is 
intended to be used by the Environmental Protection Agency in 
calculating corporate average fuel economy values pursuant to 
regulations at 40 CFR Part 600--Fuel Economy of Motor Vehicles.


<R05>
Sec. 474.2  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this part, the term:
    Combined energy consumption value means the weighted average of the 
Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule and the Highway Fuel Economy Driving 
Schedule energy consumption values (weighted 55/45 percent, 
respectively), as determined by the Environmental Protection Agency in 
accordance with 40 CFR parts 86 and 600.
    Electric vehicle means a vehicle that is powered by an electric 
motor drawing current from rechargeable storage batteries or other 
portable electrical energy storage devices, provided that:

[[Page 507]]

    (1) Recharge energy must be drawn from a source off the vehicle, 
such as residential electric service; and
    (2) The vehicle must comply with all provisions of the Zero Emission 
Vehicle definition found in 40 CFR 88.104-94(g).
    Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule energy consumption value means 
the average number of watt-hours of electrical energy required for an 
electric vehicle to travel one mile of the Highway Fuel Economy Driving 
Schedule, as determined by the Environmental Protection Agency.
    Petroleum equivalency factor means the value specified in 
Sec. 474.3(b) of this part, which incorporates the parameters listed in 
49 U.S.C. 32904(a)(2)(B) and is used to calculate petroleum-equivalent 
fuel economy.
    Petroleum-equivalent fuel economy means the value, expressed in 
miles per gallon, that is calculated for an electric vehicle in 
accordance with Sec. 474.3(a) of this part, and reported to the 
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for use in 
determining the vehicle manufacturer's corporate average fuel economy.
    Petroleum-powered accessory means a vehicle accessory (e.g., a cabin 
heater, defroster, and/or air conditioner) that:
    (1) Uses gasoline or diesel fuel as its primary energy source; and
    (2) Meets the requirements for fuel, operation, and emissions in 40 
CFR part 88.104-94(g).
    Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule energy consumption value means 
the average number of Watt-hours of electrical energy required for an 
electric vehicle to travel one mile of the Urban Dynamometer Driving 
Schedule, as determined by the Environmental Protection Agency.


<R05>
Sec. 474.3  Petroleum-equivalent fuel economy calculation.

    (a) The petroleum-equivalent fuel economy for an electric vehicle is 
calculated as follows:
    (1) Determine the electric vehicle's Urban Dynamometer Driving 
Schedule energy consumption value and the Highway Fuel Economy Driving 
Schedule energy consumption value in units of Watt-hours per mile;
    (2) Determine the combined energy consumption value by averaging the 
Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule energy consumption value and the 
Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule energy consumption value using a 
weighting of 55 percent urban/45 percent highway; and
    (3) Calculate the petroleum-equivalent fuel economy by dividing the 
appropriate petroleum-equivalency factor (depending on whether any 
petroleum-powered accessories are installed; see paragraph (b) of this 
section) by the combined energy consumption value, and round to the 
nearest 0.01 miles per gallon.
    (b) The petroleum-equivalency factors for electric vehicles are as 
follows:
    (1) If the electric vehicle does not have any petroleum-powered 
accessories installed, the value of the petroleum equivalency factor is 
82,049 Watt-hours per gallon.
    (2) If the electric vehicle has any petroleum-powered accessories 
installed, the value of the petroleum-equivalency factor is 73,844 Watt-
hours per gallon.


<R05>
Sec. 474.4  Test procedures.

    (a) The electric vehicle energy consumption values used in the 
calculation of petroleum-equivalent fuel economy under Sec. 474.3 of 
this part will be determined by the Environmental Protection Agency 
using the Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule and Urban Dynamometer 
Driving Schedule test cycles at 40 CFR parts 86 and 600.
    (b) The ``Special Test Procedures'' provisions of 40 CFR 86.090-27 
may be used to accommodate any special test procedures required for 
testing the energy consumption of electric vehicles.


<R05>
Sec. 474.5  Review and Update

    The Department will review Part 474 five years after the date of 
publication as a final rule to determine whether any updates and/or 
revisions are necessary. DOE will publish a notice in the Federal 
Register soliciting stakeholder input in this review. The Department 
will publish the findings of the review and any resulting adjustments to 
Part 474 in the Federal Register.

[[Page 508]]

     Appendix to Part 474--Sample Petroleum-Equivalent Fuel Economy 
                              Calculations

    Example 1: An electric vehicle is tested in accordance with 
Environmental Protection Agency procedures and is found to have an Urban 
Dynamometer Driving Schedule energy consumption value of 265 Watt-hours 
per mile and a Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule energy consumption 
value of 220 Watt-hours per mile. The vehicle is not equipped with any 
petroleum-powered accessories. The combined electrical energy 
consumption value is determined by averaging the Urban Dynamometer 
Driving Schedule energy consumption value and the Highway Fuel Economy 
Driving Schedule energy consumption value using weighting factors of 55 
percent urban, and 45 percent highway:

combined electrical energy consumption value = (0.55 * urban) + (0.45 * 
highway) = (0.55 * 265) + (0.45 * 220) = 244.75 Wh/mile

    Since the vehicle does not have any petroleum-powered accessories 
installed, the value of the petroleum equivalency factor is 82,049 Watt-
hours per gallon, and the petroleum-equivalent fuel economy is:

(82,049 Wh/gal) (244.75 Wh/mile) = 335.24 mpg
    Example 2: The vehicle from Example 1 is equipped with an optional 
diesel-fired cabin heater/defroster. For the purposes of this example, 
it is assumed that the electrical efficiency of the vehicle is 
unaffected.
    Since the vehicle has a petroleum-powered accessory installed, the 
value of the petroleum equivalency factor is 73,844 Watt-hours per 
gallon, and the petroleum-equivalent fuel economy is:

(73,844 Wh/gal) (244.75 Wh/mile) = 301.71 mpg

    This subpart sets forth rules implementing the provisions of Section 
507(o) of the Act which requires, subject to some exemptions, that 
certain percentages of new light duty motor vehicles acquired for State 
fleets be alternative fueled vehicles.


<R05>
Sec. 490.201  Alternative fueled vehicle acquisition mandate schedule.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this part, of the new light duty 
motor vehicles acquired annually for State government fleets, including 
agencies thereof but excluding municipal fleets, the following 
percentages shall be alternative fueled vehicles for the following model 
years;
    (1) 10 percent for model year 1997;
    (2) 15 percent for model year 1998;
    (3) 25 percent for model year 1999;
    (4) 50 percent for model year 2000; and
    (5) 75 percent for model year 2001 and thereafter.
    (b) Each State shall calculate its alternative fueled vehicle 
acquisition requirements for the State government fleets, including 
agencies thereof, by applying the alternative fueled vehicle acquisition 
percentages for each model year to the total number of new light duty 
motor vehicles to be acquired during that model year for those fleets.
    (c) If the calculation performed under paragraph (b) of this section 
produces a number that requires the acquisition of a partial vehicle, an 
adjustment to the acquisition number will be made by rounding the number 
of vehicles down the next whole number if the fraction is less than one 
half and by rounding the number of vehicles up to the next whole number 
if the fraction is equal to or greater than one half.
    (d) A State fleet that first becomes subject to this part after 
model year

[[Page 515]]

1997 shall acquire alternative fueled vehicles in the next model year at 
the percentage applicable to that model year according to the schedule 
in paragraph (a) of this section, unless the State is granted an 
exemption or reduction of the acquisition percentage pursuant to the 
procedures and criteria in section 490.204.

documentation required by this section.
    (b) A covered person requesting an exemption must demonstrate that--
    (1) Alternative fuels that meet the normal requirements and 
practices of the principal business of the covered person are not 
available from fueling sites that would permit central fueling of that 
person's vehicles in the area in which the vehicles are to be operated; 
or
    (2) Alternative fueled vehicles that meet the normal requirements 
and practices of the principal business of the covered person are not 
available for purchase or lease commercially on reasonable terms and 
conditions in any State included in a MSA/CMSA that the vehicles are 
operated in.
    (c) Documentation. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c) (2) of 
this section, if a covered person is seeking an exemption under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the types of documentation that are to
