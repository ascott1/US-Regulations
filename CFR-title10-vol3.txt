                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2008), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

Sec. 202.21  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart sets forth the procedures to be followed when a 
subpoena, order, or other demand (hereinafter referred to as a 
``demand'') of a court or other authority is issued for the production 
or disclosure of (1) any material contained in the files of the 
Department of Energy (DOE), (2) any information relating to material 
contained in the files of the DOE, or (3) any information or material 
acquired by any person while such person was an employee of the DOE as a 
part of the performance of his official duties or because of his 
official status.
    (b) For purposes of this subpart, the term ``Employee of the DOE'' 
includes all officers and employees of the United States appointed by,

Administrator of DOE.


<R05>
Sec. 202.22  Production or disclosure prohibited unless approved by appropriate DOE official.

    No employee or former employee of the DOE shall, in response to a 
demand of a court or other authority, produce any material contained in 
the file of the DOE or disclose any information relating to material 
contained in the files of the DOE, or disclose any information or

    (a) Whenever a demand is made upon an employee or former employee of 
the DOE for the production of material or the disclosure of information 
described in Sec. 202.21(a), he shall immediately notify the Regional 
Counsel for the region where the issuing authority is located. The 
Regional Counsel shall immediately request instructions from the General 
Counsel of DOE.
    (b) If oral testimony is sought by the demand, an affidavit, or, if 
that is not feasible, a statement by the party seeking the testimony or 
his attorney, setting forth a summary of the testimony desired, must be 
furnished for submission by the Regional Counsel to the General Counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 202.24  Final action by the appropriate DOE official.

    If the General Counsel approves a demand for the production of 
material or disclosure of information, he shall so notify the Regional 
Counsel and such other persons as circumstances may warrant.

[[Page 6]]


<R05>
Sec. 202.25  Procedure where a decision concerning a demand is not made prior to the time a response to the demand is required.

    If response to the demand is required before the instructions from 
the General Counsel are received, a U.S. attorney or DOE attorney 
designated for the purpose shall appear with the employee or former 
employee of the DOE upon whom the demand has been made, and shall 
furnish the court or other authority with a copy of the regulations 
contained in this subpart and inform the court or other authority that 
the demand has been, or is being, as the case may be, referred for the 
prompt consideration of the appropriate DOE official and shall 
respectfully request the court or authority to stay the demand pending 
receipt of the requested instructions.


<R05>
Sec. 202.26  Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling.

    If the court or other authority declines to stay the effect of the 
demand in response to a request made in accordance with Sec. 202.25 
pending receipt of instructions, of if the court or other authority 
rules that the demand must be complied with irrespective of instructions 
not to produce the material or disclose the information sought, the 
employee or former employee upon whom the demand has been made shall 
respectfully decline to comply with the demand. ``United States ex rel

    (3) The DOE Official who issues a subpoena or SRO pursuant to this 
section, for good cause shown, may extend the time prescribed for 
compliance with the subpoena or SRO and negotiate and approve the terms

    (4) Prior to the time specified for compliance, but in no event more 
than 10 days after the date of service of the subpoena or SRO, the

notice of the document prior to the return date of the document.
    (d)(1) A witness subpoenaed by the DOE shall be paid the same fees 
and mileage as paid to a witness in the district courts of the United 
States.
    (2) If in the course of a proceeding conducted pursuant to subpart M 
or O, a subpoena is issued at the request of a person other than an 
officer or agency of the United States, the witness fees and mileage 
shall be paid by the person who requested the subpoena. However, at the 
request of the person, the witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the 
DOE if the person shows:
    (i) The presence of the subpoenaed witness will materially advance 
the proceeding; and
    (ii) The person who requested that the subpoena be issued would 
suffer a serious hardship if required to pay the witness fees and 
mileage. The DOE Official issuing the subpoena shall make the 
determination required by this subsection.

[[Page 12]]

    (e) If any person upon whom a subpoena or SRO is served pursuant to

subpoena or SRO, an action may be commenced in the United States 
District Court to enforce the subpoena or SRO.
    (f) (1) Documents produced in response to a subpoena shall be

furnished is true, complete, and correct unless withheld on grounds of 
privilege pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section.

include a statement setting forth every reason for failing to comply 
with the subpoena or SRO.
    (g) If a person to whom a subpoena or SRO is directed withholds any 
document or information because of a claim of attorney-client or other 
privilege, the person submitting the certification required by paragraph 
(f) of this section also shall submit a written list of the documents or 
the information withheld indicating a description of each document or 
information, the date of the document, each person shown on the document

Official shall determine whether the testimony shall be recorded and the 
means by which the testimony is recorded.
    (2) A witness whose testimony is recorded may procure a copy of his 
testimony by making a written request for a copy and paying the

    (b) Signing. All applications, petitions, requests, appeals, 
comments or any other documents that are required to be signed, shall be 
signed by the person filing the document or a duly authorized 
representative. Any application, appeal, petition, request, complaint or 
other document filed by a duly authorized representative shall contain a 
statement by such person certifying that he is a duly authorized 
representative, unless an DOE form other wise requires. (A false 
certification is unlawful under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 1001 
(1970)).
    (c) Labeling. An application, petition, or other request for action 
by the DOE or a State Office should be clearly labeled according to the 
nature of the action involved (e.g., ``Application for Assignment'') 
both on the document and on the outside of the envelope in which the 
document is transmitted.
    (d) Obligation to supply information. A person who files an 
application, petition, complaint, appeal or other request for action is 
under a continuing obligation during the proceeding to provide the DOE 
or a State Office with any new or newly discovered information that is 
relevant to that proceeding. Such information includes, but is not 
limited to, information regarding any other application, petition, 
complaint, appeal or request for action that is subsequently filed by 
that person with any DOE office or State Office.
    (e) The same or related matters. A person who files an application, 
petition, complaint, appeal or other request for action by the DOE or a 
State Office shall state whether, to the best knowledge of that person, 
the same or related issue, act or transaction has been or presently is 
being considered or investigated by any DOE office, other Federal 
agency, department or instrumentality; or by a State Office, a state or 
municipal agency or court; or by any law enforcement agency; including, 
but not limited to, a consideration or investigation in connection with 
any proceeding described in this part. In addition, the person shall 
state whether contact has been made by the person or one acting on his 
behalf with any person who is employed by the DOE or any State Office 
with regard to the same issue, act or transaction or a related issue, 
act or transaction arising out of the same factual situation; the name 
of the person contacted; whether the contact was verbal or in writing; 
the nature and substance of the contact; and the date or dates of the 
contact.
    (f) Request for confidential treatment. (1) If any person filing a 
document with the DOE or a State Office claims that some or all the 
information contained in the document is exempt from the mandatory 
public disclosure requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (5 
U.S.C. 552 (1970)), is information referred to in 18 U.S.C. 1905 (1970), 
or is otherwise exempt by law from public disclosure, and if such person 
requests the DOE or a State Office not to disclose such information, 
such person shall file together with the document a second copy of the 
document from which has been deleted the information for which such 
person wishes to claim confidential treatment. The person shall indicate 
in the original document that it is confidential or contains 
confidential information and may file a statement specifying the 
justification for non-disclosure of the information for which 
confidential treatment is claimed. If the person states that the

[[Page 14]]

information comes within the exception in 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) for trade 
secrets and commercial or financial information, such person shall 
include a statement specifying why such information is privileged or 
confidential. If the person filing a document does not submit a second 
copy of the document with the confidential information deleted, the DOE 
or a State Office may assume that there is no objection to public 
disclosure of the document in its entirety.
    (2) The DOE or a State Office retains the right to make its own 
determination with regard to any claim of confidentiality. Notice of the 
decision by the DOE or a State Office to deny such claim, in whole or in 
part, and an opportunity to respond shall be given to a person claiming 
confidentiality of information no less than five days prior to its 
public disclosure.
    (g) Separate applications, petitions or requests. Each application, 
petition or request for DOE action shall be submitted as a separate 
document, even if the applications, petitions, or requests deal with the 
same or a related issue, act or transaction, or are submitted in 
connection with the same proceeding.

Sec. 205.80  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart establishes the procedures for the filing of a 
formal request for an interpretation and for the consideration of such 
request. Responses, which may include verbal or written responses to 
general inquiries or to other than formal written requests for 
interpretation filed with the General Counsel or his delegate or a 
Regional Counsel, are not interpretations and merely provide general 
information.
    (b) A request for interpretation that includes, or could be 
construed to include an application for an exception or an exemption may 
be treated solely as a request for interpretation and processed as such.

    (a) A person filing under this subpart shall file a ``Request for 
Interpretation,'' which should be clearly labeled as such both on the 
request and on the outside of the envelope in which the request is 
transmitted, and shall be in writing and signed by the person filing the 
request. The person filing the request shall comply with the general 
filing requirements stated in Sec. 205.9 in addition to the 
requirements stated in this subpart.
    (b) If the person filing the request wishes to claim confidential 
treatment for any information contained in the request or other 
documents submitted under this subpart, the procedures set out in Sec. 
205.9(f) shall apply.


<R05>
Sec. 205.82  Where to file.

    A request for interpretation shall be filed with the General Counsel

<R05>
Sec. 205.83  Contents.

    (a) The request shall contain a full and complete statement of all 
relevant facts pertaining to the circumstances, act or transaction that 
is the subject of the request and to the DOE action

[[Page 18]]

sought. Such facts shall include the names and addresses of all affected 
persons (if reasonably ascertainable) and a full discussion of the 
pertinent provisions and relevant facts contained in the documents 
submitted with the request. Copies of all relevant contracts, 
agreements, leases, instruments, and other documents shall be submitted 
with the request. When the request pertains to only one step of a larger 
integrated transaction, the facts, circumstances, and other relevant 
information pertaining to the entire transaction must be submitted.
    (b) The request for interpretation shall include a discussion of all 
relevant authorities, including, but not limited to, DOE rulings, 
regulations, interpretations and decisions on appeals and exceptions 
relied upon to support the particular interpretation sought therein.


<R05>
Sec. 205.84  DOE evaluation.

    (a) Processing. (1) The DOE may initiate an investigation of any 
statement in a request and utilize in its evaluation any relevant facts 
obtained by such investigation. The DOE may accept submissions from 
third persons relevant to any request for interpretation provided that 
the person making the request is afforded an opportunity to respond to 
all third person submissions. In evaluating a request for 
interpretation, the DOE may consider any other source of information. 
The DOE on its own initiative may convene a conference, if, in its 
discretion, it considers that such conference will advance its 
evaluation of the request.
    (2) The DOE shall issue its interpretation on the basis of the 
information provided in the request, unless that information is 
supplemented by other information brought to the attention of the 
General Counsel or a Regional Counsel during the proceeding. The 
interpretation shall, therefore, depend for its authority on the 
accuracy of the factual statement and may be relied upon only to the 
extent that the facts of the actual situation correspond to those upon 
which the interpretation was based.
    (3) If the DOE determines that there is insufficient information 
upon which to base a decision and if upon request additional information 
is not submitted by the person requesting the interpretation, the DOE 
may refuse to issue an interpretation.
    (b) Criteria. (1) The DOE shall base an interpretation on the FEA 
and EPAA and the regulations and published rulings of the DOE as applied 
to the specific factual situation.
    (2) The DOE shall take into consideration previously issued 
interpretations dealing with the same or a related issue.


<R05>
Sec. 205.85  Decision and effect.

    (a) An interpretation may be issued after consideration of the 
request for interpretation and other relevant information received or 
obtained during the proceeding.
    (b) The interpretation shall contain a statement of the information 
upon which it is based and a legal analysis of and conclusions regarding 
the application of rulings, regulations and other precedent to the 
situation presented in the request.
    (c) Only those persons to whom an interpretation is specifically 
addressed and other persons upon whom the DOE serves the interpretation 
and who are directly involved in the same transaction or act may rely 
upon it. No person entitled to rely upon an interpretation shall be 
subject to civil or criminal penalties stated in subpart P of this part 
for any act taken in reliance upon the interpretation, notwithstanding 
that the interpretation shall thereafter be declared by judicial or 
other competent authority to be invalid.
    (d) An interpretation may be rescinded or modified at any time. 
Rescission or modification may be effected by notifying persons entitled 
to rely on the interpretation that it is rescinded or modified. This 
notification shall include a statement of the reasons for the recision 
or modification and, in the case of a modification, a restatement of the 
interpretation as modified.
    (e) An interpretation is modified by a subsequent amendment to the 
regulations or ruling to the extent that it is inconsistent with the 
amended regulation or ruling.

[[Page 19]]

    (f)(1) Any person aggrieved by an interpretation may submit a 
petition for reconsideration to the General Counsel within 30 days of 
service of the interpretation from which the reconsideration is sought. 
There has not been an exhaustion of administrative remedies until a 
period of 30 days from the date of service of the interpretation has 
elapsed without receipt by the General Counsel of a petition for 
reconsideration or, if a petition for reconsideration of the 
interpretation has been filed in a timely manner, until that petition 
has been acted on by the General Counsel. However, a petition to which 
the General Counsel does not respond within 60 days of the date of 
receipt thereof, or within such extended time as the General Counsel may 
prescribe by written notice to the petitioner concerned within that 60 
day period, shall be considered denied.
    (2) A petition for reconsideration may be summarily denied if--
    (i) It is not filed in a timely manner, unless good cause is shown; 
or
    (ii) It is defective on its face for failure to state, and to 
present facts and legal argument in support thereof, that the 
interpretation was erroneous in fact or in law, or that it was arbitrary 
or capricious.
    (3) The General Counsel may deny any petition for reconsideration if 
the petitioner does not establish that--

<R05>
Sec. 205.170  Purpose and scope.

    This subpart establishes the procedures for requesting and 
conducting a DOE conference, hearing, or public hearing. Such 
proceedings shall be convened in the discretion of the DOE, consistent 
with the requirements of the FEAA.


<R05>
Sec. 205.171  Conferences.

    (a) The DOE in its discretion may direct that a conference be 
convened, on its own initiative or upon request by a person, when it 
appears that such conference will materially advance the proceeding. The 
determination as to who may attend a conference convened under this 
subpart shall be in the discretion of the DOE, but a conference will 
usually not be open to the public.
    (b) A conference may be requested in connection with any proceeding 
of the DOE by any person who might be aggrieved by that proceeding. The 
request may be made in writing or verbally, but must include a specific 
showing as to why such conference will materially advance the

requested the conference.
    (d) When a conference is convened in accordance with this section,

treated as if submitted in the regular course of the proceedings. A 
transcript of the conference will not usually be prepared. However, the 
DOE in its discretion may have a verbatim transcript prepared.
    (e) Because a conference is solely for the exchange of views 
incident to a proceeding, there will be no formal reports or findings 
unless the DOE in its discretion determines that such would be 
advisable.


<R05>
Sec. 205.172  Hearings.

    (a) The DOE in its discretion may direct that a hearing be convened 
on its own initiative or upon request by a person, when it appears that 
such hearing will materially advance the proceedings. The determination 
as to who may attend a hearing convened under this subpart shall be in 
the discretion of DOE, but a hearing will usually not be open to the 
public. Where the hearing involves a matter arising under part 213, the 
Director of Oil Imports shall be notified as to its time and place, in 
order that he or his representative may present views as to the issue or 
issues involved.
    (b) A hearing may only be requested in connection with an 
application for an exception or an appeal. Such request may be by the 
applicant, appellant, or any other person who might be aggrieved by the 
DOE action sought. The request shall be in writing and shall include a 
specific showing as to why such hearing will materially advance the 
proceeding. The request shall be addressed to the DOE office that is 
considering the application for an exception or the appeal.
    (c) The DOE will designate an agency official to conduct the 
hearing, and will specify the time and place for the hearing.
    (d) A hearing may only be convened after actual notice of the time, 
place, and nature of the hearing is provided both to the applicant or 
appellant and to any other person readily identifiable by the DOE as one 
who will be aggrieved by the DOE action involved. The notice shall 
include, as appropriate:

[[Page 21]]

    (1) A statement that such person may participate in the hearing; or
    (2) A statement that such person may request a separate conference 
or hearing regarding the application or appeal.
    (e) When a hearing is convened in accordance with this section, each 
person may present views as to the issue or issues involved. Documentary 
evidence may be presented at the hearing, but will be treated as if 
submitted in the regular course of the proceedings. A transcript of the 
hearing will not usually be prepared. However, the DOE in its discretion 
may have a verbatim transcript prepared.
    (f) The official conducting the hearing may administer oaths and 
affirmations, rule on the presentation of information, receive relevant 
information, dispose of procedural requests, determine the format of the 
hearing, and otherwise regulate the course of the hearing.
    (g) Because a hearing is solely for the exchange of views incident 
to a proceeding, there will be no formal reports or findings unless the 
DOE in its discretion determines that such would be advisable.

substantial impact on the Nation's economy or large numbers of 
individuals or businesses; or
    (2) When the DOE determines that a public hearing would materially 
advance the consideration of the issue. A public hearing may be 
requested by any interested person in connection with a rulemaking 
proceeding, but shall only be convened on the initiative of the DOE 
unless otherwise required by statute.
    (b) A public hearing may be convened incident to any proceeding when 
the DOE in its discretion determines that such public hearing would 
materially advance the consideration of the issue.
    (c) A public hearing may only be convened after publication of a 
notice in the Federal Register, which shall include a statement of the 
time, place, and nature of the public hearing.
    (d) Interested persons may file a request to participate in the 
public hearing in accordance with the instructions in the notice 
published in the Federal Register. The request shall be in writing and 
signed by the person making the request. It shall include a description 
of the person's interest in the issue or issues involved and of the 
anticipated content of the presentation. It shall also contain a 
statement explaining why the person would be an appropriate spokesperson 
for the particular view expressed.

hearing. An agenda shall be prepared that shall provide, to the extent 
practicable, for the presentation of all relevant views by competent 
spokespersons.
    (f) A verbatim transcript shall be made of the hearing. The 
transcript, together with any written comments submitted in the course 
of the proceeding, shall be made available for public inspection and 
copying in the public docket room, as provided in Sec. 205.15.

<R05>
Sec. 205.190  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart establishes the procedures for determining the 
nature and extent of violations of the DOE regulations in parts 210, 
211, and 212 and the procedures for issuance of a Notice of Probable 
Violation, a Proposed Remedial Order, a Remedial Order, an Interim 
Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, a Remedial Order for Immediate 
Compliance, a Notice of Probable Disallowance, a Proposed Order of 
Disallowance, an Order of Disallowance, or a Consent Order. Nothing in 
these regulations shall affect the authority of DOE enforcement 
officials in coordination with the Department of Justice to initiate 
appropriate civil or criminal enforcement actions in court at any time.
    (b) When any report required by the ERA or any audit or 
investigation discloses, or the ERA otherwise discovers, that there is 
reason to believe a violation of any provision of this chapter, or any 
order issued thereunder, has occurred, is continuing or is about to 
occur, the ERA may conduct an inquiry to determine the nature and extent 
of the violation. A Remedial Order or Order of Disallowance may be 
issued thereafter by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. The ERA may 
commence enforcement proceedings by serving a Notice of Probable 
Violation, a Notice of Probable Disallowance, a Proposed Remedial Order, 
a Proposed Order of Disallowance, or an Interim Remedial Order for 
Immediate Compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 205.191  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 205.192  Proposed remedial order.

    (a) If the ERA finds, after the 30-day or other period authorized 
for reply to the Notice of Probable Violation, that a violation has 
occurred, is continuing, or is about to occur, it may issue a Proposed 
Remedial Order, which shall set forth the relevant facts and law.
    (b) The ERA may issue a Proposed Remedial Order at any time it finds 
that a violation has occurred, is continuing, or is about to occur even 
if it has not previously issued a Notice of Probable Violation.
    (c) The ERA shall serve a copy of the Proposed Remedial Order upon 
the person to whom it is directed. The ERA shall promptly publish a 
notice in the Federal Register which states the person to whom the 
Proposed Remedial Order is directed, his address, and the products, 
dollar amounts, time period, and geographical area specified in the 
Proposed Remedial Order. The notice shall indicate that a copy of the 
Proposed Remedial Order with confidential information, if any, deleted 
may be obtained from the ERA and that within 15 days after the date of 
publication any aggrieved person may file a Notice of Objection with the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals of accordance with Sec. 205.193. The ERA 
shall mail copies of the Federal Register notice to all readily 
identifiable persons who are likely to be aggrieved by issuance of the 
Proposed Remedial Order as a final order.
    (d) The Proposed Remedial Order shall set forth the proposed 
findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which it is based. It shall 
also include a discussion of the relevant authorities which support the 
position asserted, including rules, regulations, rulings, 
interpretations and previous decisions issued by DOE or its predecessor 
agencies. The Proposed Remedial Order shall be accompanied by a 
declaration executed by the DOE employee primarily knowledgeable about 
the facts of the case stating that, to the best of declarant's knowledge 
and belief, the findings of fact are correct.
    (e) The ERA may amend or withdraw a Proposed Remedial Order at its 
discretion prior to the date of service of a Statement of Objections in 
that proceeding. The date of service of the amended documents shall be 
considered the date of service of the Proposed Remedial Order in 
calculating the time periods specified in this part 205.


<R05>
Sec. 205.192A  Burden of proof.

    (a) In a Proposed Remedial Order proceeding the ERA has the burden 
of establishing a prima facie case as to the validity of the findings of 
fact and conclusions of law asserted therein. The ERA shall be deemed to 
meet this burden by the service of a Proposed Remedial Order that meets 
the requirements of Sec. 205.192(d) and any supplemental information 
that may be made available under Sec. 205.193A.

[[Page 23]]

    (b) Once a prima facie case has been established, a person who 
objects to a finding of fact or conclusion of law in the Proposed 
Remedial Order has the burden of going forward with the evidence. 
Furthermore, the proponent of additional factual representations has the 
burden of going forward with the evidence.
    (c) Unless otherwise specified by the Director of the Office of 
Hearings and Appeals or his designee, the proponent of an order or a 
motion or additional factual representations has the ultimate burden of 
persuasion.


<R05>
Sec. 205.193  Notice of Objection.

    (a) Within 15 days after publication of the notice of a Proposed 
Remedial Order in the Federal Register any aggrieved person may file a 
Notice of Objection to the Proposed Remedial Order with the Office of 
Hearings and Appeals. The Notice shall be filed in duplicate, shall 
briefly describe how the person would be aggrieved by issuance of the 
Proposed Remedial Order as a final order and shall state the person's 
intention to file a Statement of Objections. No confidential information 
shall be included in a Notice of Objection. The DOE shall place one copy 
of the Notice in the Office of Hearings and Appeals Public Docket Room.
    (b) A person who fails to file a timely Notice of Objection shall be 
deemed to have admitted the findings of fact and conclusions of law as 
stated in the Proposed Remedial Order. If a Notice of Objection is not 
filed as provided by paragraph (a) of this section, the Proposed 
Remedial Order may be issued as a final order.
    (c) A person who files a Notice of Objection shall on the same day 
serve a copy of the Notice upon the person to whom the Proposed Remedial 
Order is directed, the DOE Office that issued the Proposed Remedial 
Order, and the DOE Assistant General Counsel for Administrative 
Litigation.
    (d) The Notice shall include a certification of compliance with the 
provisions of this section, the names and addresses of each person 
served with a copy of the Notice, and the date and manner of service.
    (e) If no person files a timely Notice of Objection, ERA may request 
the Office of Hearings and Appeals to issue the Proposed Remedial Order 
as a final Remedial Order.
    (f) In order to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to a 
Remedial Order proceeding, a person must file a timely Notice of 
Objection and Statement of Objections with the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals.


<R05>
Sec. 205.193A  Submission of ERA supplemental information.

    Within 20 days after service of a Notice of Objection to a Proposed 
Remedial Order the ERA may serve, upon the person to whom the Proposed 
Remedial Order was directed, supplemental information relating to the 
calculations and determinations which support the findings of fact set 
forth in the Proposed Remedial Order.


<R05>
Sec. 205.194  Participants; official service list.

    (a) Upon receipt of a Notice of Objection, the Office of Hearings 
and Appeals shall publish a notice in the Federal Register which states 
the person to whom the Proposed Remedial Order is directed, his address 
and the products, dollar amounts, time period, and geographical area 
specified in the Proposed Remedial Order. The notice shall state that 
any person who wishes to participate in the proceeding must file an 
appropriate request with the Office of Hearings and Appeals.
    (b) The Office that issued the Proposed Remedial Order and the 
person to whom the Order is directed shall be considered participants 
before the Office of Hearings and Appeals at all stages of an 
enforcement proceeding. Any other person whose interest may be affected 
by the proceeding may file a request to participate in the proceeding 
with the Office of Hearings and Appeals within 20 days after publication 
of the notice referred to in paragraph (a) of this section. The request 
shall contain
    (1) The person's name, address, and telephone number and similar 
information concerning his duly authorized representative, if any;
    (2) A detailed description of the person's interest in the 
proceeding;

    (3) The specific reasons why the person's active involvement in the 
proceeding will substantially contribute to a complete resolution of the 
issues to be considered in the proceeding;
    (4) A statement of the position which the person intends to adopt in 
the proceeding; and
    (5) A statement of the particular aspects of the proceeding, e.g. 
oral argument, submission of briefs, or discovery, in which the person 
wishes to actively participate.
    (c) After considering the requests submitted pursuant to paragraph 
(b) of this section, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall determine 
those persons who may participate on an active basis in the proceeding 
and the nature of their participation. Participants with similar 
interests may be required to consolidate their submissions and to appear 
in the proceeding through a common representative.
    (d) Within 30 days after publication of the notice referred to in 
paragraph (a) of this section, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall 
prepare an official service list for the proceeding. Within the same 30 
day period the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall mail the official 
service list to all persons who filed requests to participate. For good 
cause shown a person may be placed on the official service list as a 
non-participant, for the receipt of documents only. An opportunity shall 
be afforded to participants to oppose the placement of a non-participant 
on the official service list.
    (e) A person requesting to participate after the period for 
submitting requests has expired must show good cause for failure to file 
a request within the prescribed time period.
    (f) The Office of Hearings and Appeals may limit the nature of a 
person's participation in the proceeding, if it finds that the facts 
upon which the person's request was based have changed or were incorrect 
when stated or that the person has not been actively participating or 
has engaged in disruptive or dilatory conduct. The action referred to in 
this provision shall be taken only after notice and an opportunity to be 
heard are afforded.

any motions or other documents filed in connection with a proceeding 
shall meet the requirements of Sec. 205.9 and shall be filed with the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals in accordance with Sec. 205.4. Unless 
otherwise specified, any participant may file a response to a motion 
within five days of service.
    (2) All documents shall be filed in duplicate, unless they contain 
confidential information, in which case they must be filed in 
triplicate.
    (3) If a person claims that any portion of a document which he is 
filing contains confidential information, such information should be 
deleted from two of the three copies which are filed. One copy from 
which confidential information has been deleted will be placed in the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals Public Docket Room.
    (b)(1) Persons other than DOE offices shall on the date a submission 
is filed serve each person on the official service list. Service shall 
be made in accordance with Sec. 205.7 and may also be made by deposit 
in the regular United States mail, properly stamped and addressed, when 
accompanied by proof of service consisting of a certificate of counsel 
or an affidavit of the person making the service. If any filing arguably 
contains confidential information, a person may serve copies with the 
confidential information deleted upon all persons on the official 
service list except DOE offices, which shall be served both an original 
filing and one with deletions.
    (2) A DOE office shall on the date it files a submission serve all 
persons on the official service list, unless the filing arguably

notify the person to whom the information relates of the opportunity to 
identify and delete the confidential information. The DOE Office may 
delay the service of a submission containing arguably confidential 
information upon all persons other than the possessor of the 
confidential information and other DOE offices up to 14 days. The 
possessor of the confidential information shall serve the filing with 
any

[[Page 25]]

deletions upon all persons on the official service list within such time 
period.
    (c) Any filing made under this section shall include a certification

Sec. 205.196  Statement of objections.

    (a) A person who has filed a Notice of Objection shall file a

person intends to contest in any further proceeding involving the 
compliance matter which is the subject of the Proposed Remedial Order. 
The Statement shall set forth the findings of fact contained in the 
Proposed Remedial Order which are alleged to be erroneous, the factual 
basis for such allegations, and any alternative findings which are 
sought. The Statement shall include a discussion of all relevant 
authorities which support the position asserted. The Statement may 
include additional factual representations which are not referred to in 
the Proposed Remedial Order and which the person contends are material 
and relevant to the compliance proceeding. For each additional factual 
representation which the person asserts should be made, the Statement 
shall include reasons why the factual representation is relevant and 
material, and the manner in which its validity is or will be 
established. The person shall also specify the manner in which each 
additional issue of fact was raised in any prior administrative 
proceeding which led to issuance of the Proposed Remedial Order, or the 
reasons why it was not raised.
    (c) A Statement of Objections that is filed by the person to whom a 
Proposed Remedial Order is directed shall include a copy of any relevant

Statement of Objections, a participant shall have 30 days from the date 
of service to respond to such submissions, notwithstanding any shorter 
time periods otherwise required in this subpart. The Response shall

the legal and factual bases which support that position. The Response 
may also contain a request that any issue of fact or law advanced in a 
Statement of Objections be dismissed. Any such request shall be

written material in his possession;
    (2) A person respond to written interrogatories;
    (3) A person admit to the genuineness of any relevant document or 
the truth of any relevant fact; or
    (4) The deposition of a material witness be taken.
    (c) A Motion for Discovery shall set forth the reasons why the 
particular discovery is necessary in order to obtain relevant and 
material evidence and shall explain why such discovery would not unduly 
delay the proceeding.
    (d) Within 20 days after a Motion for Discovery is served, a 
participant or a person to whom the discovery is directed may file a 
request that the Motion be denied in whole or in part, stating the 
reasons which support the request.
    (e) Discovery may be conducted only pursuant to an Order issued by 
the Office of Hearings and Appeals. A Motion for Discovery will be 
granted if it is concluded that discovery is necessary for the party to 
obtain relevant and material evidence and that discovery will not unduly 
delay the proceeding. Depositions will be permitted if a convincing 
showing is made that the participant cannot obtain the material sought 
through one of the other discovery means specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (f) The Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his 
designee may issue subpoenas in accordance with Sec. 205.8 in support

    (h)(1) If a person fails to comply with an order relating to 
discovery, the Office of Hearings and Appeals may order appropriate

or appeal only upon issuance of the determination referred to in Sec. 
205.199B.


<R05>
Sec. 205.198A  Protective order.

    A participant who has unsuccessfully attempted in writing to obtain 
information that another participant claims is confidential may file a 
Motion for Discovery and Protective Order. This motion shall meet the 
requirements of Sec. 205.198 and shall specify the particular 
confidential information that the movant seeks and the reasons why the 
information is necessary to adequately present the movant's position in 
the proceeding. A copy of the written request for information, a 
certification concerning when and to whom it was served and a copy of 
the response, if any, shall be appended to the motion. The motion must 
give the possessor of the information notice that a Response to the 
Motion must be filed within ten days. The Response shall specify the 
safeguards, if any, that should be imposed if the information is ordered 
to be released. The Office of Hearings and Appeals may issue a 
Protective Order upon consideration of the Motion and the Response.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199  Evidentiary hearing.

    (a) Filing Requirements. At the time a person files a Statement of 
Objections he may also file a motion requesting an evidentiary hearing 
be convened. A motion requesting an evidentiary hearing may be filed by 
any other participant within 30 days after that participant is served 
with a Statement of Objections.
    (b) Contents of Motion for Evidentiary Hearing. A Motion for 
Evidentiary Hearing shall specify each disputed issue of fact and the 
bases for the alternative findings the movant asserts. The movant shall 
also describe the manner in which each disputed issue of fact was raised 
in any prior administrative proceeding which led to issuance of the 
Proposed Remedial Order, or why it was not raised. The movant shall with 
respect to each disputed or alternative finding of fact:

[[Page 27]]

    (1) As specifically as possible, identify the witnesses whose 
testimony is required;
    (2) State the reasons why the testimony of the witnesses is 
necessary; and
    (3) State the reasons why the asserted position can be effectively 
established only through the direct questioning of witnesses at an 
evidentiary hearing.
    (c) Response to Motion for Evidentiary Hearing. Within 20 days after 
service of any Motion for Evidentiary Hearing, the Office that issued 
the Proposed Remedial Order shall, and any other participant may file a 
Response with the Office of Hearings and Appeals. The Response shall 
specify:
    (1) Each particular factual representation which is accepted as 
correct for purposes of the proceeding;
    (2) Each particular factual representation which is denied;
    (3) Each particular factual representation which the participant is 
not in a position to accept or deny;
    (4) Each particular factual representation which is not accepted and 
the participant wishes proven by the submission of evidence;
    (5) Each particular factual representation which the participant is 
prepared to dispute through the testimony of witnesses or the submission 
of verified documents; and
    (6) Each particular factual representation which the participant 
asserts should be dismissed as immaterial or irrelevant.
    (d) Prehearing Conferences. After all submissions with respect to a 
Motion for Evidentiary Hearing are filed, the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals may conduct conferences or hearings to resolve differences of 
view among the participants.
    (e) Decision on Motion for Evidentiary Hearing. After considering 
all relevant information received in connection with the Motion, the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals shall enter an Order. In the Order the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals shall direct that an evidentiary hearing 
be convened if it concludes that a genuine dispute exists as to relevant 
and material issues of fact and an evidentiary hearing would 
substantially assist it in making findings of fact in an effective 
manner. If the Motion for Evidentiary Hearing is granted in whole or in 
part, the Order shall specify the parties to the hearing, any 
limitations on the participation of a party, and the issues of fact set 
forth for the evidentiary hearing. The Order may also require parties 
that have adopted similar positions to consolidate their presentations 
and to appear at the evidentiary hearing through a common 
representative. If the Motion is denied, the Order may allow the movant 
to file affidavits and other documents in support of his asserted 
findings of fact.
    (f) Review of Decision. The Order of the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals with respect to a Motion for Evidentiary Hearing shall be 
subject to further administrative review or appeal only upon issuance of 
the determination referred to in Sec. 205.199B.
    (g) Conduct of Evidentiary Hearing. All evidentiary hearings 
convened pursuant to this section shall be conducted by the Director of 
the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee. At any evidentiary 
hearing the parties shall have the opportunity to present material 
evidence which directly relates to a particular issue of fact set forth 
for hearing. The presiding officer shall afford the parties an 
opportunity to cross examine all witnesses. The presiding officer may 
administer oaths and affirmations, rule on objections to the 
presentation of evidence, receive relevant material, rule on any motion 
to conform the Proposed Remedial Order to the evidence presented, rule 
on motions for continuance, dispose of procedural requests, determine 
the format of the hearing, modify any order granting a Motion for 
Evidentiary Hearing, direct that written motions or briefs be provided 
with respect to issues raised during the course of the hearing, issue 
subpoenas, and otherwise regulate the conduct of the hearing. The 
presiding officer may take reasonable measures to exclude duplicative 
material from the hearing, and may place appropriate limitations on the 
number of witnesses that may be called by a party. The presiding officer 
may also require that evidence be submitted through affidavits or other 
documents if the direct testimony of witnesses will unduly delay the 
orderly

[[Page 28]]

progress of the hearing and would not contribute to resolving the issues 
involved in the hearing. The provisions of Sec. 205.8 which relate to 
subpoenas and witness fees shall apply to any evidentiary hearing, 
except that subsection Sec. 205.8(h) (2), (3), and (4) shall not apply.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199A  Hearing for the purpose of oral argument only.

    (a) A participant is entitled upon timely request to a hearing to 
present oral argument with respect to the Proposed Remedial Order, 
whether or not an evidentiary hearing is requested or convened. A 
participant's request shall normally be considered untimely, if made 
more than 10 days after service of a determination regarding any motion 
filed by the requestor or, if no motions were filed by him, if made 
after the date for filing his Reply or his Response to a Statement of 
Objections.
    (b) If an evidentiary hearing is convened, and a hearing for oral 
argument is requested, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall 
determine whether the hearing for oral argument shall be held in 
conjunction with the evidentiary hearing or at a separate time.
    (c) A hearing for the purpose of receiving oral argument will 
generally be conducted only after the issues involved in the proceeding 
have been delineated, and any written material which the Office of 
Hearings and Appeals has requested to supplement a Statement of 
Objections or Responses has been submitted. The presiding officer may 
require further written submissions in support of any position advanced 
or issued at the hearing, and shall allow responses any such 
submissions.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199B  Remedial order.

    (a) After considering all information received during the 
proceeding, the Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his 
designee may issue a final Remedial Order. The Remedial Order may adopt 
the findings and conclusions contained in the Proposed Remedial Order or 
may modify or rescind any such finding or conclusion to conform the 
Order to the evidence or on the basis of a determination that the 
finding or conclusion is erroneous in fact or law or is arbitrary or 
capricious. In the alternative, the Office of Hearings and Appeals may 
determine that no Remedial Order should be issued or may remand all or a 
portion of the Proposed Remedial Order to the issuing DOE office for 
further consideration or modification. Every determination made pursuant 
to this section shall state the relevant facts and legal bases 
supporting the determination.
    (b) The DOE shall serve a copy of any determination issued pursuant 
to paragraph (a) of this section upon the person to whom it is directed, 
any person who was served with a copy of the Proposed Remedial Order, 
the DOE office that issued the Proposed Remedial Order, the DOE 
Assistant General Counsel for Administrative Litigation and any other 
person on the official service list. Appropriate deletions may be made 
in the determinations to ensure that confidentiality of information 
protected from disclosure under 18 U.S.C. 1905 and 5 U.S.C. 552. A copy 
of the determination with appropriate deletions to protect confidential 
and proprietary data shall be placed in the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals Public Docket Room.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199C  Appeals of remedial order to FERC.

    (a) The person to whom a Remedial Order is issued by the Office of 
Hearings and Appeals may file an administrative appeal if the Remedial 
Order proceeding was initiated by a Notice of Probable Violation issued 
after October 1, 1977, or, in those situations in which no Notice of 
Probable Violation was issued, if the proceeding was initiated by a 
Proposed Remedial Order issued after October 1, 1977.
    (b) Any such appeal must be initiated within 30 days after service 
of the Order by giving written notice to the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals that the person to whom a Remedial Order is issued wishes to 
contest the Order.
    (c) The Office of Hearings and Appeals shall promptly advise the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission of its receipt of a notice 
described in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) The Office of Hearings and Appeals may, on a case by case basis, 
set reasonable time limits for the Federal

[[Page 29]]

Energy Regulatory Commission to complete its action on such an appeal 
proceeding.
    (e) In order to exhaust administrative remedies, a person who is 
entitled to appeal a Remedial Order issued by the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals must file a timely appeal and await a decision on the merits. 
Any Remedial Order that is not appealed within the 30-day period shall 
become effective as a final Order of the DOE and is not subject to 
review by any court.

<R05>
Sec. 205.199F  Ex parte communications.

    (a) No person who is not employed or otherwise supervised by the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals shall submit ex parte communications to 
the Director or any person employed or otherwise supervised by the 
Office with respect to any matter involved in Remedial Order or Order of 
Disallowance proceedings.
    (1) Ex parte communications include any ex parte oral or written 
communications relative to the merits of a Proposed Remedial Order, 
Interim Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, or Proposed Order of 
Disallowance proceeding pending before the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals. The term shall not, however, include requests for status 
reports, inquiries as to procedures, or the submission of proprietary or 
confidential information. Notice that proprietary or confidential 
submissions have been made shall be given to all persons on the official 
service list.
    (b) If any communication occurs that violates the provisions of this 
section, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall promptly make the 
substance of the communication available to the public and serve a copy 
of a written communication or a memorandum summarizing an oral 
communication to all participants in the affected proceeding. The Office 
of Hearings and Appeals may also take any other appropriate action to 
mitigate the adverse impact to any person whose interest may be affected 
by the ex parte contact.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199G  Extension of time; Interim and Ancillary Orders.

    The Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee 
may permit upon motion any document or submission referred to in this 
subpart other than appeals to FERC to be amended or withdrawn after it 
has been filed or to be filed within a time period different from that 
specified in this subpart. The Director or his designee may upon motion 
or on his own initiative issue any interim or ancillary Orders, 
reconsider any determinations, or make any rulings or determinations 
that are deemed necessary to ensure that the proceedings specified in 
this subpart are conducted in an appropriate manner and are not unduly 
delayed.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199H  Actions not subject to administrative appeal.

    A Notice of Probable Violation, Notice of Proposed Disallowance, 
Proposed Remedial Order or Interim Remedial Order for Immediate 
Compliance issued pursuant to this subpart shall not be an action from 
which there may be an administrative appeal pursuant to subpart H. In 
addition, a determination by the Office of Hearings and Appeals that a 
Remedial Order, an Order of Disallowance, or a Remedial Order for 
Immediate Compliance should not be issued shall not be appealable 
pursuant to subpart H.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199I  Remedies.

    (a) A Remedial Order, a Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, an 
Order of Disallowance, or a Consent Order may require the person to whom 
it is directed to roll back prices, to make refunds equal to the amount 
(plus interest) charged in excess of those amounts permitted under DOE 
Regulations, to make appropriate compensation to third persons for 
administrative expenses of effectuating appropriate remedies, and to 
take such other action as the DOE determines is necessary to eliminate 
or to compensate for the effects of a violation or any cost disallowance 
pursuant to Sec. 212.83 or Sec. 212.84. Such action may include a 
direction to the person to whom the Order is issued to establish an 
escrow account or take other measures to

[[Page 30]]

make refunds directly to purchasers of the products involved, 
notwithstanding the fact that those purchasers obtained such products 
from an intermediate distributor of such person's products, and may 
require as part of the remedy that the person to whom the Order is 
issued maintain his prices at certain designated levels, notwithstanding 
the presence or absence of other regulatory controls on such person's 
prices. In cases where purchasers cannot be reasonably identified or 
paid or where the amount of each purchaser's overcharge is incapable of 
reasonable determination, the DOE may refund the amounts received in 
such cases directly to the Treasury of the United States on behalf of 
such purchasers.
    (b) The DOE may, when appropriate, issue final Orders ancillary to a 
Remedial Order, Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, Order of 
Disallowance, or Consent Order requiring that a direct or indirect 
recipient of a refund pass through, by such means as the DOE deems 
appropriate, including those described in paragraph (a) of this section, 
all or a portion of the refund, on a pro rata basis, to those customers 
of the recipient who were adversely affected by the initial overcharge. 
Ancillary Orders may be appealed to the Office of Hearings and Appeals 
only pursuant to subpart H.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199J  Consent order.

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, the DOE may 
at any time resolve an outstanding compliance investigation or 
proceeding, or a proceeding involving the disallowance of costs pursuant 
to Sec. 205.199E with a Consent Order. A Consent Order must be signed 
by the person to whom it is issued, or a duly authorized representative, 
and must indicate agreement to the terms contained therein. A Consent 
Order need not constitute an admission by any person that DOE 
regulations have been violated, nor need it constitute a finding by the 
DOE that such person has violated DOE regulations. A Consent Order 
shall, however, set forth the relevant facts which form the basis for 
the Order.
    (b) A Consent Order is a final Order of the DOE having the same 
force and effect as a Remedial Order issued pursuant to Sec. 205.199B 
or an Order of Disallowance issued pursuant to Sec. 205.199E, and may 
require one or more of the remedies authorized by Sec. 205.199I and 
Sec. 212.84(d)(3). A Consent Order becomes effective no sooner than 30 
days after publication under paragraph (c) of this section, unless (1) 
the DOE makes a Consent Order effective immediately, because it 
expressly deems it necessary in the public interest, or (2) the Consent 
Order involves a sum of less than $500,000 in the aggregate, excluding 
penalties and interest, in which case it will be effective when signed 
both by the person to whom it is issued and the DOE, and will not be 
subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section unless the 
DOE determines otherwise. A Consent Order shall not be appealable 
pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 205.199C or Sec. 205.199D and 
subpart H, and shall contain an express waiver of such appeal or 
judicial review rights as might otherwise attach to a final Order of the 
DOE.
    (c) When a Consent Order has been signed, both by the person to whom 
it is issued and the DOE, the DOE will publish notice of such Consent 
Order in the Federal Register and in a press release to be issued 
simultaneously therewith. The Federal Register notice and the press 
release will state at a minimum the name of the company concerned, a 
brief summary of the Consent Order and other facts or allegations 
relevant thereto, the address and telephone number of the DOE office at 
which copies of the Consent Order will be available free of charge, the 
address to which comments on the Consent Order will be received by the 
DOE, and the date by which such comments should be submitted, which date 
will not be less than 30 days after publication of the Federal Register 
notice. After the expiration of the comment period the DOE may withdraw 
its agreement to the Consent Order, attempt to negotiate a modification 
of the Consent Order, or issue the Consent Order as signed. The DOE will 
publish in the Federal Register, and by press release, notice of any 
action taken on a Consent Order and such explanation of

[[Page 31]]

the action taken as deemed appropriate. The provisions of this paragraph 
shall be applicable notwithstanding the fact that a Consent Order may 
have been made immediately effective pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section (except in cases where the Consent Order involves sums of less 
than $500,000 in the aggregate, excluding penalties and interest).
    (d) At any time and in accordance with the procedures of subpart J, 
a Consent Order may be modified or rescinded, upon petition by the 
person to whom the Consent Order was issued, and may be rescinded by the 
DOE upon discovery of new evidence which is materially inconsistent with 
evidence upon which the DOE's acceptance of the Consent Order was based. 
Modifications of a Consent Order which is subject to public comment 
under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, which in the 
opinion of the DOE significantly change the terms or the impact of the 
original Order, shall be republished under the provisions of that 
paragraph.
    (e) Notwithstanding the issuance of a Consent Order, the DOE may 
seek civil or criminal penalties or compromise civil penalties pursuant 
to subpart P concerning matters encompassed by the Consent Order, unless 
the Consent Order by its terms expressly precludes the DOE from so 
doing.
    (f) If at any time after a Consent Order becomes effective it 
appears to the DOE that the terms of the Consent Order have been 
violated, the DOE may refer such violations to the Department of Justice 
for appropriate action in accordance with subpart P.

Sec. 205.280  Purpose and scope.

    This subpart establishes special procedures pursuant to which 
refunds may be made to injured persons in order to remedy the effects of 
a violation of the regulations of the Department of Energy. This subpart 
shall be applicable to those situations in which the Department of 
Energy is unable to readily identify persons who are entitled to

[[Page 33]]

refunds specified in a Remedial Order, a Remedial Order for Immediate 
Compliance, an Order of Disallowance or a Consent Order, or to readily 
ascertain the amounts that such persons are entitled to receive.


<R05>
Sec. 205.281  Petition for implementation of special refund procedures.

    (a) At any time after the issuance of a Remedial Order (including 
for purposes of this subpart a Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance 
and an Order of Disallowance), or a Consent Order, the Special Counsel 
of the Department of Energy, the ERA Office of Enforcement, or any other 
enforcement official of the Department of Energy may file with the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals a Petition for the Implementation of 
Special Refund Procedures.
    (b) The Petition shall state that the person filing it has been 
unable readily either to identify the persons who are entitled to 
refunds to be remitted pursuant to a Remedial Order or a Consent Order 
or to ascertain the amounts of refunds that such persons are entitled to 
receive. The Petition shall request that the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals institute appropriate proceedings under this Subpart to 
distribute the funds referred to in the enforcement documents.
    (c) The Petition shall contain a copy of each relevant enforcement 
document, shall be filed in duplicate, and shall meet the requirements 
of Sec. 205.9 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 205.282  Evaluation of petition by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.

    (a) After considering the Petition, the Director of the Office of 
Hearings and Appeals or his designee shall issue a Proposed Decision and 
Order. The Proposed Decision and Order shall generally describe the 
nature of the particular refund proceeding and shall set forth the 
standards and procedures that the Office of Hearings and Appeals intends 
to apply in evaluating refund claims.
    (b) The Proposed Decision and Order shall be published in the 
Federal Register together with a statement that any member of the public 
may submit written comments to the Office of Hearings and Appeals with 
respect to the matter. At least 30 days following publication in the 
Federal Register shall be provided for the submission of comments.
    (c) After considering the comments submitted, the Director of the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee shall issue a final 
Decision and Order which shall govern the disposition of the refunds. 
The final Decision and Order shall also be published in the Federal 
Register.
    (d) The final Decision and Order shall set forth the standards and 
procedures that will be used in evaluating individual Applications for 
Refunds and distributing the refund amount. Those standards and 
procedures shall be consistent with the provisions of this subpart.
    (e) In establishing standards and procedures for implementing refund 
distributions, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall take into 
account the desirability of distributing the refunds in an efficient, 
effective and equitable manner and resolving to the maximum extent 
practicable all outstanding claims. In order to do so, the standards for 
evaluation of individual claims may be based upon appropriate 
presumptions.


<R05>
Sec. 205.283  Applications for refund.

    (a) Any person entitled to a refund pursuant to a final Decision and 
Order issued pursuant to Sec. 205.282 may file an Application for 
Refund. All Applications must be signed by the applicant and specify the 
DOE order to which they pertain. Any Application for a refund in excess 
of $100 must be file in duplicate, and a copy of that Application will 
be available for public inspection in the DOE Public Docket Room at 2000 
M Street, NW., Washington, DC. Any applicant who believes that his 
Application contains confidential information must so indicate on the 
first page of his Application and submit two additional copies of his 
Application from which the information that the applicant claims is 
confidential has been deleted, together with a statement specifying why 
any such information is privileged or confidential.
    (b) The contents of an Application for Refund shall be specified in 
the final

[[Page 34]]

Decision and Order referred to in Sec. 205.282(c). A filing deadline 
for Applications shall also be specified in the final Decision and 
Order, and shall be no less than 90 days after the publication of the 
Order in the Federal Register.
    (c) Each Application shall be in writing and signed by the 
applicant, and shall indicate whether the applicant or any person acting 
on his instructions has filed or intends to file any other Application 
or claim of whatever nature regarding the matters at issue in the 
underlying enforcement proceeding. Each Application shall also include a

Sec. 205.284  Processing of applications.

    (a) The Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals may appoint 
an administrator to evaluate Applications under guidelines established 
by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. The administrator, if he is not a 
Federal Government employee, may be compensated from the funds referred 
to in the Remedial Order or Consent Order. The administrator may design 
and distribute an optional application form for the convenience of the 
applicants.
    (b) The Office of Hearings and Appeals or its designee may initiate 
an investigation of any statement made in an Application and may require 
verification of any document submitted in support of a claim. In 
evaluating an Application, the Office of Hearings and Appeals or its 
designee may solicit and consider information obtained from any source 
and may on its own initiative convene a hearing or conference, if it 
determines that a hearing or conference will advance its evaluation of 
an Application.
    (c) The Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his 
designee shall conduct any hearing or conference convened with respect 
to an Application for Refund and shall specify the time and place for 
the hearing or conference and notify the applicant. The official 
conducting the hearing may administer oaths and affirmations, rule on 
the presentation of information, receive relevant information, dispose 
of procedural requests, determine the format of the hearing and 
otherwise regulate the course of the hearing. The provisions of Sec. 
205.8 of this part which relate to subpoenas and witness fees shall 
apply to any hearing convened with respect to an application for refund, 
except that Sec. 205.8(h) (2), (3) and (4) shall not apply.
    (d) Upon consideration of an Application and other relevant 
information received during the course of a refund proceeding, the 
Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee shall 
issue an order granting or denying the Application. The order shall 
contain a concise statement of the relevant facts and the legal basis 
for the order. A copy of the order, with such modification as is 
necessary to ensure the confidentiality of information protected from 
public disclosure by 18 U.S.C. 1905, may be obtained upon request by an 
applicant or any other person who participated in the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 205.285  Effect of failure to file a timely application.

    An Application for Refund must be filed no later than the date that 
the Office of Hearings and Appeals establishes pursuant to Sec. 
205.283(b). Any Application that is not filed on a timely basis may be 
summarily dismissed. The Office of Hearings and Appeals or its designee 
may, however, grant extensions of time for good cause shown. Any request 
for an extension of time must generally be submitted in writing prior to 
the deadline.


<R05>
Sec. 205.286  Limitations on amount of refunds.

    (a) The aggregate amount of all refunds approved by the Office of 
Hearings and Appeals or its designee in a given case shall not exceed 
the amount to be remitted pursuant to the relevant DOE enforcement 
order, plus any accumulated interest, reduced by the amount of any 
administrative costs approved by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. In 
the event that the aggregate amount of approved claims exceeds the 
aggregate amount of funds specified above, the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals may make refunds on a pro rata basis. The Office of Hearings and 
Appeals may delay payment of any

[[Page 35]]

refunds until all Applications have been processed.
    (b) The Office of Hearings and Appeals may decline to consider 
Applications for refund amounts that, in view of the direct 
administrative costs involved, are too small to warrant individual 
consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 205.287  Escrow accounts, segregated funds and other guarantees.

    (a) In implementing the refund procedures specified in this subpart, 
the Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee shall 
issue an order providing for the custody of the funds to be tendered 
pursuant to the Remedial Order or Consent Order. This Order may require 
placement of the funds in an appropriate interest-bearing escrow 
account, retention of the funds by the firm in a segregated account 
under such terms and conditions as are specified by the DOE, or the 
posting of a sufficient bond or other guarantee to ensure payment.
    (b) All costs and charges approved by the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals and incurred in connection with the processing of Applications 
for Refund or incurred by an escrow agent shall be paid from the amount 
of funds, including any accumulated interest, to be remitted pursuant to 
the Remedial Order or Consent Order.
    (c) After the expenses referred to in paragraph (b) of this section 
have been satisfied and refunds distributed to successful applicants, 
any remaining funds remitted pursuant to the Remedial Order or Consent 
Order shall be deposited in the United States Treasury or distributed in 
any other manner specified in the Decision and Order referred to in 
Sec. 205.282(c).
    (d) Funds contained in an escrow account, segregated fund, or 
guaranteed by other approved means shall be disbursed only upon written 
order of the Office of Hearings and Appeals.


<R05>
Sec. 205.288  Interim and ancillary orders.

    The Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee 
may issue any interim or ancillary orders, or make any rulings or 
determinations to ensure that refund proceedings, including the actions 
of the administrator and the custodian of the funds involved in a refund 
proceeding, are conducted in an appropriate manner and are not unduly 
delayed.

<R05>
Sec. 205.328  Environmental requirements for Presidential Permits--Alternative 1.

    (a) NEPA Compliance. Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (e) of 
this section, when an applicant seeks a Presidential Permit, such 
applicant will be responsible for the costs of preparing any necessary 
environmental document, including an Environmental Impact Statement 
(EIS), arising from ERA's obligation to comply with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). ERA will determine whether an 
environmental assessment (EA) or EIS is required within 45 days of the 
receipt of the Presidential Permit application and of environmental 
information submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 205.322 (c) and (d). ERA will 
use these and other sources of information as the basis for making the 
environmental determination:
    (1) If an EIS is determined to be necessary, the applicant shall 
enter into a contract with an independent third party, which may be a 
Government-owned, contractor-operated National Laboratory, or a 
qualified private entity selected by ERA. The third party contractor 
must be qualified to conduct an environmental review and prepare an EIS, 
as appropriate, under the supervision of ERA, and may not have a 
financial or other interest in the outcome of the proceedings. The NEPA 
process must be completed and approved before ERA will issue a 
Presidential Permit.
    (2) If an EA is determined to be necessary, the applicant may be 
permitted to prepare an environmental assessment pursuant to 10 CFR 
1506.5(b) for review and adoption by ERA, or the applicant may enter 
into a third party contract as set forth in this section.
    (b) Environmental Review Procedure. Except as provided in paragraphs 
(c) and (e) of this section, environmental documents, including the EIS, 
where necessary, will be prepared utilizing the process set forth above. 
ERA, the applicant, and the independent third party, which may be a 
Government-owned, contractor-operated National Laboratory or a private 
entity, shall enter into an agreement in which the applicant will engage 
and pay directly for the services of the qualified third party to 
prepare the necessary environmental documents. The agreement shall 
outline the responsibilities of each party and its relationship to the 
other two parties regarding the work to be done or supervised. ERA shall 
approve the information to be developed and supervise the gathering, 
analysis

[[Page 41]]

and presentation of the information. In addition, ERA will have the 
authority to approve and modify any statement, analysis, and conclusion 
contained in the environmental documents prepared by the third party. 
Before commencing preparation of the environmental document the third 
party will execute an ERA-prepared disclosure document stating that it 
does not have any conflict of interest, financial or otherwise, in the 
outcome of either the environmental process or the Permit application.
    (c) Financial Hardship. Whenever ERA determines that a project is no 
longer economically feasible, or that a substantial financial burden 
would be imposed by the applicant bearing all of the costs of the NEPA 
studies, ERA may waive the requirement set forth in paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section and perform the necessary environmental review, 
completely or in part, with its own resources.
    (d) Discussions Prior to Filing. Prior to the preparation of any 
Presidential Permit application and environmental report, a potential 
applicant is encouraged to contact ERA and each affected State public 
utility regulatory agency to discuss the scope of the proposed project 
and the potential for joint State and Federal environmental review.
    (e) Federal Exemption. Upon a showing by the applicant that it is 
engaged in the transaction of official business of the Federal 
Government in filing the application pursuant to 10 CFR 205.320 et seq., 
it will be exempt from the requirements of this section.

financially responsible for the expenses of any contractor chosen by ERA 
to prepare any necessary environmental document arising from ERA's 
obligation to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
(NEPA) in issuing such Presidential Permits:
    (1) ERA will determine whether an Environmental Impact Statement 
(EIS) or an Environmental Assessment (EA) is required within 45 days of 
receipt of the Presidential Permit application and of the environmental 
information submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 205.322 (c) and (d). ERA will 
use these and other sources of information as the basis for making the 
environmental determination.
    (2) If an EIS is determined to be necessary, ERA will notify the 
applicant of the fee for completing the EIS within 90 days after the 
submission of the application and environmental information. The fee 
shall be based on the expenses estimated to be incurred by DOE in 
contracting to prepare the EIS (i.e., the estimated fee charges to ERA 
by the contractor). DOE employee salaries and other fixed costs, as set 
forth in OMB Circular A-25, shall not be included in the applicant's 
fee. Fee payment shall be by check, draft, or money order payable to the 
Treasurer of the United States, and shall be submitted to ERA. Upon 
submission of fifty percent of the environmental fee, ERA will provide 
to the applicant a tentative schedule for completion of the EIS.
    (3) If an EA is determined to be necessary, the applicant may be 
permitted to prepare an environmental assessment pursuant to 40 CFR 
1506.5(b) for review and adoption by ERA, or the applicant may choose to 
have ERA prepare the EA pursuant to the fee procedures set forth above.
    (4) The NEPA process must be completed and approved before ERA will 
issue a Presidential Permit.
    (b) Financial Hardship. Whenever ERA determines that a project is no 
longer economically feasible, or that a substantial financial burden 
would be imposed by the applicant bearing all of the costs of the NEPA 
studies, ERA may waive the requirement set forth in paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section and perform the necessary environmental review, 
completely or in part, with its own resources.
    (c) Discussions Prior to Filing. Prior to the preparation of any 
Presidential Permit application and environmental

[[Page 42]]

assessment, a potential applicant is encouraged to contact ERA and each 
affected State public utility regulatory agency to discuss the scope of 
the proposed project and the potential for joint State and Federal 
environmental review.
    (d) Fee Payment. The applicant shall make fee payment for completing 
the EIS to ERA in the following manner:
    (1) 50 percent of the total amount due to be paid within 30 days of 
receipt of the fee information from DOE;
    (2) 25 percent to be paid upon publication of the draft EIS; and
    (3) 25 percent to be paid upon publication of the final EIS.

If costs are less than the amount collected, ERA will refund to the 
applicant the excess fee collected. If costs exceed the initial fee, ERA 
will fund the balance, unless the increase in costs is caused by actions 
or inactions of the applicant, such as the applicant's failure to submit 
necessary environmental information in a timely fashion. If the 
application is withdrawn at any stage prior to issuance of the final 
EIS, the fee will be adjusted to reflect the costs actually incurred; 
payment shall be made by the applicant within 30 days of above 
referenced events.
    (e) Federal Exemption. Upon a showing by the applicant that it is 
engaged in the transaction of official business of the Federal 
Government in filing an application pursuant to 10 CFR 205.320 et seq., 
it will be exempt from the requirements of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 205.370  Applicability.

    Sections 202(c) and 202(d) of the Federal Power Act are applicable 
to any ``entity'' which owns or operates electric power generation, 
transmission or distribution facilities. An ``entity'' is a private or 
public corporation (utility), a governmental agency, a municipality, a 
cooperative or a lawful association of the foregoing. Under this 
section, the DOE has the authority to order the temporary connection of 
facilities, or the generation or delivery of electricity, which it deems 
necessary to alleviate an emergency. Such orders shall be effective for 
the time specified and will be subject to the terms and conditions the 
DOE specifies. The DOE retains the right to cancel, modify or otherwise 
change any order, with or without notice, hearing, or report. Requests 
for action under these regulations will be accepted from any ``entity,'' 
State Public Utility Commission, State Energy Agency, or State Governor. 
Actions under these regulations also may be initiated by the DOE on its 
own motion. Orders under this authority may be made effective without 
prior notice.


<R05>
Sec. 205.371  Definition of emergency.

    ``Emergency,'' as used herein, is defined as an unexpected 
inadequate supply of electric energy which may result from the 
unexpected outage or breakdown of facilities for the generation, 
transmission or distribution of electric power. Such events may be the 
result of weather conditions, acts of God, or unforeseen occurrences not 
reasonably within the power of the affected ``entity'' to prevent. An 
emergency also can result from a sudden increase in customer demand, an 
inability to obtain adequate amounts of the necessary fuels to generate 
electricity, or a regulatory action which prohibits the use of certain 
electric power supply facilities. Actions under this authority are 
envisioned as meeting a specific inadequate power supply situation. 
Extended periods of insufficient power supply as a result of inadequate 
planning or the failure to construct necessary facilities can result in 
an emergency as contemplated in these regulations. In such cases, the 
impacted ``entity'' will be expected to make firm arrangements to 
resolve the problem until new facilities become available, so that a 
continuing emergency order is not needed. Situations where a shortage of 
electric energy is projected due solely to the failure of parties to 
agree to terms, conditions or other economic factors relating to 
service, generally will not be considered as emergencies unless the 
inability to supply electric service is imminent. Where an electricity 
outage or service inadequacy qualifies for a section 202(c) order, 
contractual difficulties alone will not be sufficient to preclude the 
issuance of an emergency order.


<R05>
Sec. 205.372  Filing procedures; number of copies.

    An original and two conformed copies of the applications and reports 
required under Sec. Sec. 205.370 through 205.379 shall be filed with

<R05>
Sec. 205.374  Responses from ``entities'' designated in the application.

    Each ``entity'' designated as a potential source of emergency 
assistance or as a potential supplier of transmission services and which 
has received a copy of the application under Sec. 205.373, shall have 
three (3) calendar days from the time of receipt of the application to 
file the information designated below with the DOE. The DOE will grant 
extensions of the filing period when appropriate. The designated 
``entities'' shall provide an analysis of the impact the requested 
action would have on its system reliability and its ability to supply 
its own interruptible and firm customers. The effects of the requested 
action on the ability to serve firm loads shall be clearly distinguished 
from the ability to serve contractually interruptible loads. The 
designated ``entity'' also may provide other information relevant to the 
requested action, which is not included in the reliability analysis. 
Copies of any response shall be provided to the applicant, the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission, any State Regulatory Agency having 
responsibility for service standards or rates of any ``entity'' that may 
be directly involved in the proposed action, and the appropriate 
Regional Electric Reliability Council. Pursuant to section 202(c) of the 
Federal Power Act, DOE may issue an emergency order even though a 
designated ``entity'' has failed to file a timely response.


<R05>
Sec. 205.375  Guidelines defining inadequate fuel or energy supply.

    An inadequate utility system fuel inventory or energy supply is a 
matter of managerial and engineering judgment based on such factors as 
fuels in stock, fuels en route, transportation time, and constraints on 
available storage facilities. A system may be considered to have an 
inadequate fuel or energy supply capability when, combined with other 
conditions, the projected energy deficiency upon the applicant's system 
without emergency action by the DOE, will equal or exceed 10 percent of 
the applicant's then normal daily net energy for load, or will cause the 
applicant to be unable to meet its normal peak load requirements based 
upon use of all of its otherwise available resources so that it is 
unable to supply adequate electric service to its ultimate customers. 
The following conditions will be considered in determining that a system 
has inadequate fuel or energy supply capability:
    (1) System coal stocks are reduced to 30 days (or less) of normal 
burn days and a continued downward trend in stock is projected;
    (2) System residual oil stocks are reduced to 15 days (or less) of 
normal burn days and a continued downward trend in stocks is projected;
    (3) System distillate oil stocks which cannot be replaced by 
alternate fuels are reduced to 15 days (or less) of normal burn days and 
a continued downward trend in stocks is projected;
    (4) System natural gas deliveries which cannot be replaced by 
alternate fuels have been or will be reduced 20 percent below normal 
requirements and no improvement in natural gas deliveries is projected 
within 30 days;
    (5) Delays in nuclear fuel deliveries will extend a scheduled 
refueling shutdown by more than 30 days; and
    (6) Water supplies required for power generation have been reduced 
to the level where the future adequacy of the power supply may be 
endangered and no near term improvement in water supplies is projected.

The use of the prescribed criteria does not preclude an applicant from 
claiming the existence of an emergency when its stocks of fuel or water 
exceed the amounts and time frames specified above.


<R05>
Sec. 205.376  Rates and charges.

    The applicant and the generating or transmitting systems from which 
emergency service is requested are encouraged to utilize the rates and 
charges contained in approved existing rate schedules or to negotiate 
mutually satisfactory rates for the proposed

[[Page 47]]

transactions. In the event that the DOE determines that an emergency 
exists under section 202(c), and the ``entities'' are unable to agree on 
the rates to be charged, the DOE shall prescribe the conditions of 
service and refer the rate issues to the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission for determination by that agency in accordance with its 
standards and procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 205.377  Reports.

    In addition to the information specified below, the DOE may require 
additional reports as it deems necessary.
    (a) Where the DOE has authorized the temporary connection of 
transmission facilities, all ``entities'' whose transmission facilities 
are thus temporarily interconnected shall report the following 
information to the DOE within 15 days following completion of the 
interconnection:
    (1) The date the temporary interconnection was completed;
    (2) The location of the interconnection;
    (3) A description of the interconnection; and
    (4) A one-line electric diagram of the interconnection.
    (b) Where the DOE orders the transfer of power, the ``entity'' 
receiving such service shall report the following information to the DOE 
by the 10th of each month for the preceding month's activity for as long 
as such order shall remain in effect:
    (1) Amounts of capacity and/or energy received each day;
    (2) The name of the supplier;
    (3) The name of any ``entity'' supplying transmission services; and
    (4) Preliminary estimates of the associated costs.
    (c) Where the DOE has approved the installation of permanent 
facilities that will be used only during emergencies, any use of such 
facilities shall be reported to the DOE within 24 hours. Details of such 
usage shall be furnished as deemed appropriate by the DOE after such 
notification.
    (d) Any substantial change in the information provided under Sec. 
205.373 shall be promptly reported to the DOE.

<R05>
Sec. 205.378  Disconnection of temporary facilities.

    Upon the termination of any emergency for the mitigation of which 
the DOE ordered the construction of temporary facilities, such 
facilities shall be disconnected and any temporary construction removed 
or otherwise disposed of, unless application is made as provided in 
Sec. 205.379 for permanent connection for emergency use. This 
disconnection and removal of temporary facilities shall be accomplished 
within 30 days of the termination of the emergency unless an extension 
is granted by the DOE. The DOE shall be notified promptly when such 
removal of facilities is completed.


<R05>
Sec. 205.379  Application for approval of the installation of permanent facilities for emergency use only.

    Application for DOE approval of a permanent connection for emergency 
use only shall conform with the requirements in Sec. 205.373. However, 
the baseline data specified in Sec. 205.373(d) need not be included in 
an application made under this section. In addition, the application 
shall state in full the reasons why such permanent connection for 
emergency use is in the public interest.

Sec. 207.4  Confidentiality of energy information.

    (a) Information obtained by the DOE under authority of ESECA shall 
be available to the public in accordance with the provisions of part 202 
of this chapter. Upon a showing satisfactory to the Administrator by any 
person that any energy information obtained under this subpart from such 
person would, if made public, divulge methods or processes entitled to 
protection as trade secrets or other proprietary information of such 
person, such information, or portion thereof, shall be deemed 
confidential in accordance with the provisions of section 1905 of title 
18, United States Code; except that such information, or part thereof, 
shall not be deemed confidential pursuant to that section for purposes 
of disclosure, upon request, to (1) any delegate of the DOE for the 
purpose of carrying out ESECA or the EPAA, (2) the Attorney General, the 
Secretary of the Interior, the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal 
Power Commission, or the General Accounting Office, when necessary to 
carry out those agencies' duties and responsibilities under ESECA and 
other statutes, and (3) the Congress, or any Committee of Congress upon 
request of the Chairman.
    (b) Whenever the Administrator requests reports of energy 
information under this subpart, he may specify (in the rule, order or 
questionnaire or other means by which he has requested such reports) the 
nature of the showing required to be made in order to satisfy DOE that 
certain energy information contained in such reports warrants 
confidential treatment in accordance with this section. He shall, to the 
maximum extent practicable, either before or after requesting reports, 
by ruling or otherwise, inform respondents providing energy information 
pursuant to this subpart of whether such information will be made 
available to the public pursuant to requests under the Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).


<R05>
Sec. 207.5  Violations.

    Any practice that circumvents or contravenes or results in a 
circumvention or contravention of the requirements of any provision of 
this subpart or any order issued pursuant thereto is a violation of the 
DOE regulations stated in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 207.6  Notice of probable violation and remedial order.

    (a) Purpose and scope. (1) This section establishes the procedures 
for determining the nature and extent of violations of this subpart and 
the procedures for issuance of a notice of probable violation, a 
remedial order or a remedial order for immediate compliance.
    (2) When the DOE discovers that there is reason to believe a 
violation of any provision of this subpart, or any order issued 
thereunder, has occurred, is continuing or is about to occur, the DOE 
may conduct proceedings to determine the nature and extent of the 
violation and may issue a remedial order thereafter. The DOE may 
commence such proceeding by serving a notice of probable violation or by 
issuing a remedial order for immediate compliance.
    (b) Notice of probable violation. (1) The DOE may begin a proceeding 
under this subpart by issuing a notice of probable violation if the DOE 
has reason to believe that a violation has occurred, is continuing, or 
is about to occur.

[[Page 50]]

    (2) Within 10 days of the service of a notice of probable violation, 
the person upon whom the notice is served may file a reply with the DOE 
office that issued the notice of probable violation at the address 
provided in Sec. 205.12 of this chapter. The DOE may extend the 10-day 
period for good cause shown.
    (3) The reply shall be in writing and signed by the person filing 
it. The reply shall contain a full and complete statement of all 
relevant facts pertaining to the act or transaction that is the subject 
of the notice of probable violation. Such facts shall include a complete 
statement of the business or other reasons that justify the act or 
transaction, it appropriate; a detailed description of the act or 
transaction; and a full discussion of the pertinent provisions and 
relevant facts reflected in any documents submitted with the reply. 
Copies of all relevant documents shall be submitted with the reply.
    (4) The reply shall include a discussion of all relevant 
authorities, including, but not limited to, DOE rulings, regulations, 
interpretations, and decisions on appeals and exceptions relied upon to 
support the particular position taken.
    (5) The reply should indicate whether the person requests or intends 
to request a conference regarding the notice. Any request not made at 
the time of the reply shall be made as soon thereafter as possible to 
insure that the conference is held when it will be most beneficial. A 
request for a conference must conform to the requirements of subpart M 
of part 205 of this chapter.
    (6) If a person has not filed a reply with the DOE within the 10-day 
period provided, and the DOE has not extended the 10-day period, the 
person shall be deemed to have conceded the accuracy of the factual 
allegations and legal conclusions stated in the notice of probable 
violation.
    (7) If the DOE finds, after the 10-day period provided in Sec. 
207.6(b)(2), that no violation has occurred, is continuing, or is about 
to occur, or that for any reason the issuance of a remedial order would 
not be appropriate, it shall notify, in writing, the person to whom a 
notice of probable violation has been issued that the notice is 
rescinded.
    (c) Remedial order. (1) If the DOE finds, after the 10-day period 
provided in Sec. 207.6(b)(2), that a violation has occurred, is 
continuing, or is about to occur, the DOE may issue a remedial order. 
The order shall include a written opinion setting forth the relevant 
facts and the legal basis of the remedial order.
    (2) A remedial order issued under this subpart shall be effective 
upon issuance, in accordance with its terms, until stayed, suspended, 
modified or rescinded. The DOE may stay, suspend, modify or rescind a 
remedial order on its own initiative or upon application by the person 
to whom the remedial order is issued. Such action and application shall 
be in accordance with the procedures for such proceedings provided for 
in part 205 of this chapter.
    (3) A remedial order may be referred at any time to the Department 
of Justice for appropriate action in accordance with Sec. 207.7.
    (d) Remedial order for immediate compliance. (1) Notwithstanding 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the DOE may issue a remedial 
order for immediate compliance, which shall be effective upon issuance 
and until rescinded or suspended, if it finds:
    (i) There is a strong probability that a violation has occurred, is 
continuing or is about to occur;
    (ii) Irreparable harm will occur unless the violation is remedied 
immediately; and
    (iii) The public interest requires the avoidance of such irreparable 
harm through immediate compliance and waiver of the procedures afforded 
under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (2) A remedial order for immediate compliance shall be served 
promptly upon the person against whom such order is issued by telex or 
telegram, with a copy served by registered or certified mail. The copy 
shall contain a written statement of the relevant facts and the legal 
basis for the remedial order for immediate compliance, including the 
findings required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (3) The DOE may rescind or suspend a remedial order for immediate 
compliance if it appears that the criteria set forth in paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section

[[Page 51]]

are no longer satisfied. When appropriate, however, such a suspension or 
rescission may be accompanied by a notice of probable violation issued 
under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (4) If at any time in the course of a proceeding commenced by a 
notice of probable violation the criteria set forth in paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section are satisfied, the DOE may issue a remedial order for 
immediate compliance, even if the 10-day period for reply specified in 
Sec. 207.6(b)(2) of this part has not expired.
    (5) At any time after a remedial order for immediate compliance has 
become effective the DOE may refer such order to the Department of 
Justice for appropriate action in accordance with Sec. 207.7 of this 
part.
    (e) Remedies. A remedial order or a remedial order for immediate 
compliance may require the person to whom it is directed to take such 
action as the DOE determines is necessary to eliminate or to compensate 
for the effects of a violation.
    (f) Appeal. (1) No notice of probable violation issued pursuant to 
this subpart shall be deemed to be an action of which there may be an 
administrative appeal.
    (2) Any person to whom a remedial order or a remedial order for 
immediate compliance is issued under this subpart may file an appeal 
with the DOE Office of Exceptions and Appeals in accordance with the 
procedures for such appeal provided in subpart H of part 205 of this 
chapter. The appeal must be filed within 10 days of service of the order 
from which the appeal is taken.


<R05>
Sec. 207.7  Sanctions.

    (a) General. (1) Penalties and sanctions shall be deemed cumulative 
and not mutually exclusive.
    (2) Each day that a violation of the provisions of this subpart or 
any order issued pursuant thereto continues shall be deemed to 
constitute a separate violation within the meaning of the provisions of 
this subpart relating to criminal fines and civil penalties.
    (b) Criminal penalties. Any person who willfully violates any 
provision of this subpart or any order issued pursuant thereto shall be 
subject to a fine of not more than $5,000 for each violation. Criminal 
violations are prosecuted by the Department of Justice upon referral by 
the DOE.
    (c) Civil Penalties. (1) Any person who violates any provision of 
this subpart or any order issued pursuant thereto shall be subject to a 
civil penalty of not more than $2,750 for each violation. Actions for 
civil penalties are prosecuted by the Department of Justice upon 
referral by the DOE.
    (2) When the DOE considers it to be appropriate or advisable, the 
DOE may compromise and settle, and collect civil penalties.

<R05>
Sec. 207.8  Judicial actions.

    (a) Enforcement of subpoenas; contempt. Any United States district 
court within the jurisdiction of which any inquiry is carried on may, 
upon petition by the Attorney General at the request of the 
Administrator, in the case of refusal to obey a subpoena or order of the 
Administrator issued under this subpart, issue an order requiring 
compliance. Any failure to obey such an order of the court may be 
punished by the court as contempt.
    (b) Injunctions. Whenever it appears to the Administrator that any 
person has engaged, is engaged, or is about to engage in any act or 
practice constituting a violation of any regulation or order issued 
under this subpart, the Administrator may request the Attorney General 
to bring a civil action in the appropriate district court of the United 
States to enjoin such acts or practices and, upon a proper showing, a 
temporary restraining order or preliminary or permanent injunction shall 
be granted without bond. The relief sought may include a mandatory 
injunction commanding any person to comply with any provision of such 
order or regulation, the violation of which is prohibited by section 
12(a) of ESECA, as implemented by this subpart.


<R05>

offices or officials as the Department of Energy has designated pursuant 
to this section, it shall satisfy paragraph (c) of this section, for the 
purpose of deposit with the Department of Energy.
    (3) To the extent that any communication is procedural, 
administrative or ministerial (for example, if it involves the location 
of a record, the place of a meeting, travel arrangements, or similar 
matters) only a brief notation of the date, time, persons involved and 
description of the communication need be recorded; except that during an

recapitulate matters already contained in a full and complete record, 
the substance of such matters shall be identified, but need not be 
recorded in detail, provided that reference is made to the record and 
the portion thereof in which the substance is fully set out.
    (c) Except where the Department of Energy otherwise provides, all

                         Subpart A_Recordkeeping


<R05>
Sec. 210.1  Records.

    (a) The recordkeeping requirements that were in effect on January 
27, 1981, in parts 210, 211, and 212 will remain in effect for (1) all 
transactions prior to February 1, 1981; and (2) all allowed expenses 
incurred and paid prior to April 1, 1981 under Sec. 212.78 of part 212. 
These requirements include, but are not limited to, the requirements 
that were in effect on January 27, 1981, in Sec. 210.92 of this part; 
in Sec. Sec. 211.67(a)(5)(ii); 211.89; 211.109, 211.127; and 211.223 of 
part 211; and in Sec. Sec. 212.78(h)(5)(ii); 212.78(h)(6); 
212.83(c)(2)(iii)(E)(I); 212.83(c)(2)(iii)(E)(II); 212.83(c)(2)(iii); 
``F<INF>i</INF> t''; 212.83(i); 212.93(a); 212.93(b)(4)(iii)(B)(I); 
212.93(i)(4); 212.94(b)(2)(iii); 212.128; 212.132; 212.172; and Sec. 
212.187 of part 212.
    (b) Effective February 5, 1985, paragraph (a) of this section shall 
apply, to the extent indicated, only to firms in the following 
categories. A firm may be included in more than one category, and a firm 
may move from one category to another. The fact that a firm becomes no 
longer subject to the recordkeeping requirements of one category shall 
not relieve that firm of compliance with the recordkeeping requirements 
of any other category in which the firm is still included.
    (1) Those firms which are or become parties in litigation with DOE, 
as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Any such firm shall 
remain subject to paragraph (a) of this section. DOE shall notify the 
firm in writing of the final resolution of the litigation and whether or 
not any of its records must be maintained for a further period. DOE 
shall notify a firm which must maintain any records for a further period 
when such records are no longer needed.
    (2)(i) Those firms which as of November 30 1984, have completed 
making all restitutionary payments required by an administrative or 
judicial order, consent order, or other settlement or order but which 
payments are on February 5, 1985, still subject to distribution by DOE. 
This requirement is applicable to only those firms listed in appendix B. 
Any such firm shall maintain all records for the time period covered by 
the administrative or judicial order, consent order, or other settlement 
or order requiring the payments, evidencing sales volume data for each 
product subject to controls and customers' names and addresses, until 
one of the following: June 30, 1985, unless this period is extended on a 
firm-by-firm basis; the end of the individual firm's extension; or the 
firm is notified in writing that its records are no longer needed.
    (ii) Those firms which as of November 30, 1984, are required to make 
restitutionary or other payments pursuant to an administrative or 
judicial order, consent order, or other settlement or order. Any such 
firm shall remain subject to paragraph (a) of this section until the 
firm completes all

[[Page 58]]

restitutionary payments required by the administrative or judicial 
order, consent order, or other settlement or order. However, after 
completing all such payments, a firm shall maintain all records 
described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section until one of the 
following: Six months after the firm completes all such payments, unless 
this period is extended on a firm-by-firm basis; the end of the 
individual firm's extension; or the firm is notified in writing that its 
records are no longer needed.
    (3)(i) Those firms with completed audits in which DOE has not yet 
made a determination to initiate a formal enforcement action and firms 
under audit which do not have outstanding subpoenas. Any such firm shall 
maintain all records for the period covered by the audit including all 
records necessary to establish historical prices or volumes which serve 
as the basis for determining the lawful prices or volumes for any 
subsequent regulated transaction which is subject to audit, until one of 
the following: June 30, 1985, unless this period is extended on a firm-
by-firm basis; the end of the individual firm's extension; or the firm 
is notified in writing by DOE that its records are no longer needed. 
However, if a firm in this group shall become a party in litigation, the 
firm shall then be subject to the recordkeeping requirements for firms 
in litigation set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Those firms under audit which have outstanding subpoenas on 
February 5, 1985, or which receive subpoenas at any time thereafter or 
which have supplied records for an audit as the result of a subpoena 
enforced after November 1, 1983. Any such firm shall remain subject to 
paragraph (a) of this section until two years after ERA has notified the 
firm in writing that is in full compliance with the subpoena or until 
ERA has received from the firm a sworn certification of compliance with 
the subpoena as required by 10 CFR 205.8. However, if a firm in this 
group shall become a party in litigation, the firm shall then be subject 
to the recordkeeping requirements for firms in litigation set forth in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (4) Those firms which are subject to requests for data necessary to 
verify that crude oil qualifies as ``newly discovered'' crude oil under 
10 CFR 212.79. Any such firm shall maintain the records evidencing such 
data until one of the following: June 30, 1985, unless this period is 
extended on a firm-by-firm basis; the end of an individual firm's 
extension; or the firm is notified in writing by DOE that its records 
are no longer needed. However, if a firm in this group shall become a 
party in litigation, the firm shall then be subject to the recordkeeping 
requirements for firms in litigation set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section.
    (5) Those firms whose records are determined by DOE as necessary to 
complete the enforcement activity relating to another firm which is also 
subject to paragraph (a) of this section unless such firms required to 
keep records have received certified notice letters specifically 
describing the records determined as necessary. At that time, the 
specific notice will control the recordkeeping requirements. These firms 
have been identified in appendix A. Any such firm shall maintain these 
records until one of the following: June 30, 1985, unless this period is 
extended on a firm-by-firm basis; the end of the individual firm's 
extension; or the firm is notified in writing by DOE that its records 
are no longer needed.
    (6) Those firms which participated in the Entitlements program. Any 
such firm shall maintain its Entitlements-related records until six 
months after the final judicial resolution (including any and all 
appeals) of Texaco v. DOE, Nos. 84-391, 84-410, and 84-456 (D. Del.), or 
the firm is notified by DOE that its records are no longer needed, 
whichever occurs first.
    (c) For purposes of this section:
    (1) A firm is ``a party in litigation'' if:
    (i)(A) The firm has received a Notice of Probable Violation, a 
Notice of Probable Disallowance, a Proposed Remedial Order, or a 
Proposed Order of Disallowance; or
    (B) The firm and DOE are parties in a lawsuit arising under the 
Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, as amended (15 U.S.C. 751 et 
seq.) or 10 CFR parts 205, 210, 211, or 212; and

[[Page 59]]

    (ii)(A) There has been no final (that is, non-appealable) 
administrative or judicial resolution, or
    (B) DOE has not informed the firm in writing that the Department has 
completed its review of the matter.
    (2) A firm means any association, company, corporation, estate, 
individual, joint-venture, partnership, or sole proprietorship, or any 
other entity, however organized, including charitable, educational, or 
other eleemosynary institutions, and state and local governments. A firm 
includes a parent and the consolidated and unconsolidated entities (if 
any) which it directly or indirectly controls.

<R05>
Sec. 216.1  Introduction.

    (a) This part describes and establishes the procedures to be used by 
the Department of Energy (``DOE'') in considering and making certain 
findings required by section 101(c)(3) of the Defense Production Act of 
1950, as amended, 50 U.S.C. App. 2071(c)(3) (``DPA''). Section 101(c) 
authorizes the allocation of, or priority performance under contracts or 
orders (other than contracts of employment) relating to, supplies of 
materials and equipment in order to maximize domestic energy supplies if 
the findings described in section 101(c)(3) are made. Among these 
findings are that such supplies of materials and equipment are critical 
and essential to maintain or further exploration, production, refining, 
transportation or the conservation of energy supplies or for the 
construction and maintenance of energy facilities. The function of 
finding if such supplies are critical and essential was delegated to the 
Administrator of the Department of Energy (``DOE'') pursuant to 
Executive Order

[[Page 67]]

11912 of April 13, 1976, Defense Mobilization Order (``DMO'') No. 13 
dated September 22, 1976, 41 FR 43720, and Department of Commerce, 
Bureau of Domestic Commerce, Delegation No. 4, effective date December 
1, 1976, 41 FR 52331. Delegation No. 4 was superseded by Defense 
Priorities and Allocations System Delegation No. 2, effective date 
August 29, 1984, 49 FR 30430. On October 1, 1977, pursuant to section 
301(a) of the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. 95-91), all 
of the functions of DOE and all of the functions of the DOE 
Administrator were transferred to the Secretary of Energy.
    (b) The purpose of these regulations is to establish the procedures 
and the criteria to be used by DOE in determining whether programs or 
projects maximize domestic energy supplies and finding whether or not 
supplies of material and equipment are critical and essential, as 
required by DPA section 101(c)(3). The critical and essential finding 
will be made only for supplies of materials and equipment related to 
those programs or projects determined by DOE to maximize domestic energy 
supplies. These regulations do not require or imply that the findings, 
on which the exercise of such authority is conditioned, will be made in 
any particular case.
    (c) If DOE determines that a program or project maximizes domestic 
energy supplies and finds that supplies of materials and equipment are 
critical and essential to maintain or further the exploration, 
production, refining, transportation or conservation of energy supplies 
or for the construction and maintenance of energy facilities, such 
determination and finding will be communicated to the Department of 
Commerce. If not, the applicant will be so informed. If the 
determination and finding described above are made, the Department of 
Commerce, pursuant to DPA section 101(c), Executive Order 11912 and DMO 
No. 13, will find whether or not (1) the supplies of materials and 
equipment in question are scarce and (2) maintenance or furtherance of 
exploration, production, refining, transportation, or conservation of 
energy supplies or the construction and maintenance of energy facilities 
cannot be reasonably accomplished without exercising the authority 
specified in section 101(c). If these additional two findings are made, 
the Department of Commerce will notify DOE, and DOE will inform the 
applicant that it has been granted the right to use priority ratings 
under the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (``DPAS'') 
regulation established by the Department of Commerce, 15 CFR 350.

time to time request whatever additional information it reasonably 
believes is relevant to the discharge of its functions pursuant to DPA 
section 101(c).

[43 FR 6212, Feb. 14, 1978, as amended at 51 FR 8311, Mar. 11, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 216.4  Evaluation by DOE of applications.

    (a) Based on the information provided by the applicant and other 
available information, DOE will assess the application and (1) determine 
whether or not the energy program or project in connection with which

    (1) Availability and utility of substitute materials or equipment; 
and
    (2) Impact of the nonavailability of the specific supplies of 
materials and equipment on the furtherance or timely completion of the 
approved energy program or project.
    (d) Increased costs which may be associated with obtaining materials 
or equipment without assistance shall not be considered a valid reason 
for finding the materials and equipment to be critical and essential.
    (e) After DOE has determined a program or project to be an eligible 
energy program or project, this determination shall be deemed made with 
regard to subsequent applications involving the same program or project 
unless and until DOE announces otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 216.5  Notification of findings.

    (a) DOE will notify the DOC if it finds that supplies of materials 
and equipment, for which an applicant requested assistance, are critical 
and essential to an eligible energy program or project, and in such 
cases will forward to the DOC the application and whatever information 
or comments DOE believes appropriate. If DOE believes at any time that 
findings previously made may no longer be valid, it will immediately 
notify the DOC and the affected applicant(s) and afford such 
applicant(s) an opportunity to show cause why such findings should not 
be withdrawn.
    (b) If DOC notifies DOE that DOC has found that supplies of 
materials and equipment, for which the applicant requested assistance, 
are scarce and that the related eligible energy program or project 
cannot reasonably be accomplished without exercising the authority 
specified in DPA section 101(c)(1), DOE will notify the applicant that 
the applicant is authorized to place rated orders and/or authorized 
controlled material orders for specific supplies of materials and 
equipment pursuant to the provisions of the DPAS Regulation, as 
promulgated by the Department of Commerce.

<R05>
Sec. 216.6  Petition for reconsideration.

    If DOE, after evaluating an application in accordance with Sec. 
216.4, does not determine that the energy program or project maximizes 
domestic energy supplies or does not find that the supplies of materials 
and equipment described in the application are critical and essential to 
an eligible energy program or project, it will so notify the applicant 
and the applicant may petition DOE for reconsideration. If DOE concludes 
at any time that findings previously made are no longer valid and should 
be withdrawn, DOE will so notify the affected applicant(s), and such 
applicant(s) may petition DOE for reconsideration of the withdrawal 
decision. Such a petition is deemed accepted when received by DOE at the 
address stated in Sec. 216.8. DOE will consider the petition for 
reconsideration and either grant or deny the relief requested. Written 
notice of the decision and of the reasons for the decision will be 
provided to the applicant. There has not been an exhaustion of 
administrative remedies until a petition for reconsideration has been 
submitted and the review procedure completed by grant or denial of the 
relief requested.

[[Page 70]]

The denial of relief requested in a petition for reconsideration is a 
final administrative decision.

<R05>
Sec. 216.7  Conflict in priority orders.

    If it appears that the use of assistance pursuant to DPA section 
101(c) creates or threatens to create a conflict with priorities and 
allocation support provided in connection with the national defense 
pursuant to DPA section 101(a), DOE will work with the DOC and other 
claimant agencies affected by such conflict in an attempt to reschedule 
deliveries or otherwise accommodate such competing demands. If 
acceptable solutions cannot be agreed upon by the claimant agencies the 
FEMA will resolve such conflicts.

Sec. 216.9  Violations.

    Any person who willfully furnishes false information or conceals any 
material fact in the course of the application process or in a petition 
for reconsideration is guilty of a crime, and upon conviction may be 
punished by fine or imprisonment or both.

the filing of an application for review of a supply order. An 
application for review is a summary proceeding which will be initiated 
only if the critieria described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section are 
satisfied.
    (b) What to file. (1) A firm filing under this subpart shall file an 
``Application for Review'' which should be clearly labeled as such both 
on the application and on the outside of the envelope in which the 
application is transmitted, and shall be in writing and signed by the 
firm filing the application. The applicant shall comply with the general 
filing requirements stated in 10 CFR 205.9 in addition to the 
requirements stated in this section.
    (2) If the applicant wishes to claim confidential treatment for any 
information contained in the application or other documents submitted 
under this

[[Page 73]]

subpart, the procedures set out in 10 CFR 205.9(f) shall apply.
    (c) When to file. An application for review should be filed no later 
than 5 days after the receipt by the applicant of the supply order that 
is the subject of the application, or no later than 2 days after the 
occurrence of an event that results in a substantial change in the facts 
or circumstances affecting the applicant.
    (d) Where to file. The application for review shall be filed with 
DOE Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), 2000 M Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20461.
    (e) Notice. The applicant shall send by United States mail or 
deliver by hand a copy of the application and any subsequent amendments 
or other documents relating to the application to the Administrator of 
the Economic Regulatory Administration of DOE, 2000 M Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20461. Service shall be made on the ERA at same time the 
document is filed with OHA and each document filed with the OHA shall 
include certification that the applicant has complied with the 
requirements of this paragraph.
    (f) Contents. (1) The application shall contain a full and complete 
statement of all relevant facts pertaining to the application and to the 
DOE action sought. Such facts shall include a complete statement of the 
business or other reasons that justify review of the supply order and a 
full description of the pertinent provisions and relevant facts 
contained in any relevant documents. Copies of all contracts, 
agreements, leases, instruments, and other documents relevant to the 
application shall be submitted with the application. A copy of the order 
of which review is sought shall be included with the application. When 
the application pertains to only one step of a larger integrated 
transaction, the facts, circumstances, and other relevant information 
pertaining to the entire transaction shall be submitted.
    (2) The application shall include a discussion of all relevant 
authorities, including, but not limited to, DOE and DOE rulings, 
regulations, interpretations and decisions on appeal and exception 
relied upon to support the action sought therein.
    (g) DOE evaluation--(1) Processing. (i) The DOE may initiate an 
investigation of any statement in an application and utilize in its 
evaluation any relevant facts obtained by such investigation. The DOE 
may solicit and accept submissions from third parties relevant to any 
application for review provided that the applicant is afforded an 
opportunity to respond to all third party submissions. In evaluating an 
application for review, the DOE may convene a conference, on its own 
initiative, if, in its discretion, it considers that a conference will 
advance its evaluation of the application.
    (ii) If the DOE determines that there is insufficient information 
upon which to base a decision and if upon request the necessary 
additional information is not submitted, the DOE may dismiss the 
application without prejudice. If the failure to supply additional 
information is repeated or willful, the DOE may dismiss the application 
with prejudice. If the applicant fails to provide the notice required by 
paragraph (e) of this section, the DOE may dismiss the application 
without prejudice.
    (iii) An order dismissing an application for any of the reasons 
specified in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section shall contain a 
statement of the grounds for the dismissal. The order shall become final 
within 5 days of its service upon the applicant, unless within such 5-
day period the applicant files an amendment correcting the deficiencies 
identified in the order. Within 5 days of the filing of such amendment, 
the DOE shall notify the applicant whether the amendment corrects the 
specified deficiencies. If the amendment does not correct the 
deficiencies specified in the order, the order shall become a final 
order of the DOE of which the applicant may seek judicial review.
    (2) An application for review of an order shall be processed only if 
the applicant demonstrates that--
    (i) There is probable cause to believe that the supply order is 
erroneous, inequitable, or unduly burdensome; or
    (ii) There has been discovered a law, regulation, interpretation, 
ruling, order or decision that was in effect at the time of the 
application which, if it had been made known to the DOE, would have been 
relevant to the supply

[[Page 74]]

order and would have substantially altered the supply order; or
    (iii) There has been a substantial change in the facts or 
circumstances affecting the applicant, which change has occurred during 
the interval between issuance of the supply order and the date of the 
application and was caused by forces or circumstances beyond the control 
of the applicant.
    (h) Decision. (1) Upon consideration of the application and other 
relevant information received or obtained during the proceeding, the DOE 
shall issue an order granting or denying the modification or rescission 
of the supply order requested in the application for review.
    (2) The DOE shall process applications for review as expeditiously 
as possible. When administratively feasible, the DOE shall issue an 
order granting or denying the application within 20 business days after 
receipt of the application.
    (3) The order shall include a written statement setting forth the 
relevant facts and the legal basis of the order. The order shall state 
that it is a final order of which the applicant may seek judicial 
review.
    (4) The DOE shall serve a copy of the order upon the applicant and 
any other party who participated in the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 218.33  Stay.

    (a) The DOE may issue an order granting a stay if the DOE determines 
that an applicant has made a compelling showing that it would incur 
serious and irreparable injury unless immediate stay relief is granted 
pending determination of an application for review pursuant to this 
subpart. An application for a stay shall be labeled as such on the 
application and on the outside of the envelope in which the application 
is transmitted, and shall be in writing and signed by the firm filing 
the application. It shall include a description of the proceeding 
incident to which the stay is being sought and of the facts and 
circumstances which support the applicant's claim that it will incur 
irreparable injury unless immediate stay relief is granted. The 
applicant shall comply with the general filing requirements stated in 10 
CFR 205.9 in addition to the requirements stated in this section. The 
DOE on its own initiative may also issue an order granting a stay upon a 
finding that a firm will incur irreparable injury if such an order is 
not granted.
    (b) An order granting a stay shall expire by its terms within such 
time after issuance, not to exceed 30 days as the DOE specifies in the 
order, except that it shall expire automatically 5 days following its 
issuance if the applicant fails within that period to file an 
application for review unless within that period the DOE for good cause 
shown, extends the time during which the applicant may file an 
application for review.
    (c) The order granting or denying a stay is not an order of the DOE 
subject to administrative review.


<R05>
Sec. 218.34  Addresses.

    All correspondence, petitions, and any information required by this 
part shall be submitted to: Administrator, Economic Regulatory

<R04>
            Subpart D_Administrative Procedures and Sanctions


<R05>
Sec. 221.31  Requests by DOD.

    (a) When DOD finds that (1) a fuel supply shortage for DOD exists or 
is anticipated which would have a substantial negative impact on the 
national defense, and (2) the defense activity for which fuel is 
required cannot be postponed until after the fuel supply shortage is 
likely to terminate, DOD may submit a written request to ERA for the 
issuance to it of a priority rating for the supply of crude oil and 
petroleum products.
    (b) Not later than the transmittal date of its request to ERA, DOD 
shall notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency that it has 
requested a priority rating from ERA.
    (c) Requests from DOD shall set forth the following:
    (1) The quantity and quality of crude oil or petroleum products 
determined by DOD to be required to meet national defense requirements;
    (2) The required delivery dates;
    (3) The defense-related activity and the supply location for which 
the crude oil or petroleum product is to be delivered;
    (4) The current or most recent suppliers of the crude oil or 
petroleum product and the reasons, if known, why the suppliers will not 
supply the requested crude oil or petroleum product;
    (5) The degree to which it is feasible for DOD to use an alternate 
product in lieu of that requested and, if such an alternative product 
can be used, the efforts which have been made to obtain the alternate 
product;
    (6) The period during which the shortage of crude oil or petroleum 
products is expected to exist;
    (7) The proposed supply source for the additional crude oil or 
petroleum products required, which shall, if practicable, be the 
historical supplier of such crude oil or product to DOD; and
    (8) Certification that DOD has made each of the findings required by 
paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 221.32  Evaluation of DOD request.

    (a) Upon receipt of a request from DOD for a priority rating as 
provided in Sec. 221.31, it shall be reviewed promptly by ERA. The ERA 
will assess the request in terms of:
    (1) The information provided under Sec. 221.31;
    (2) Whether DOD's national defense needs for crude oil or petroleum 
products can reasonably be satisfied without exercising the authority 
specified in this part;
    (3) The capability of the proposed supplier to supply the crude oil 
or petroleum product in the amounts required;
    (4) The known capabilities of alternative suppliers;
    (5) The feasibility to DOD of converting to and using a product 
other than that requested; and
    (6) Any other relevant information.
    (b) The ERA promptly shall notify the proposed supplier of DOD's 
request for a priority rating specified under this part. The proposed 
supplier shall have a period specified in the notice, not to exceed 
fifteen (15) days from the date it is notified of DOD's request, to show 
cause in writing why it cannot supply the requested quantity and quality 
of crude oil or petroleum products. ERA shall consider this information 
in determining whether to issue the priority rating.
    (c) If acceptance by a supplier of a rated order would create a 
conflict with another rated order of the supplier, it shall include all 
pertinent information regarding such conflict in its response to the 
show cause order provided for in subsection (b), and ERA, in 
consultation with DOD and the Federal Emergency Management Agency shall 
determine the priorities for meeting all such requirements.

[[Page 78]]

    (d) ERA may waive some or all of the requirements of Sec. 221.31 or 
this section where the Secretary of Defense or his designee certifies, 
and has so notified the Federal Emergency Management Agency, that a fuel 
shortage for DOD exists or is imminent and that compliance with such 
requirements would have a substantial negative impact on the national 
defense.


<R05>
Sec. 221.33  Order.

    (a) Issuance. If ERA determines that issuance of a priority rating 
for a crude oil or refined petroleum product is necessary to provide the 
crude oil or petroleum products needed to meet the national defense 
requirement established by DOD, it shall issue such a rating to DOD for 
delivery of specified qualities and quantities of the crude oil or 
refined petroleum products on or during specified delivery dates or 
periods. In accordance with the terms of the order, DOD may then place 
such priority rating on a supply order.
    (b) Compliance. Each person who receives a priority-rated supply 
order pursuant to this part shall supply the specified crude oil or 
petroleum products to DOD in accordance with the terms of that order.
    (c) ERA directives. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this 
part, where necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense ERA 
is authorized to issue a directive to a supplier of crude oil or 
petroleum product requiring delivery of specified qualities and 
quantities of such crude oil or petroleum products to DOD at or during 
specified delivery dates or periods.
    (d) Use of ratings by suppliers. No supplier who receives a 
priority-rated supply order or directive issued under the authority of 
this section may use such priority order or directive in order to obtain 
materials necessary to meet its supply obligations thereunder.


<R05>
Sec. 221.34  Effect of order.

    Defense against claims for damages. No person shall be liable for 
damages or penalties for any act or failure to act resulting directly or 
indirectly from compliance with any ERA authorized priority-rated supply 
order or ERA directive issued pursuant to this part, notwithstanding 
that such priority-rated supply order or directive thereafter be 
declared by judicial or other competent authority to be invalid.


<R05>
Sec. 221.35  Contractual requirements.

    (a) No supplier may discriminate against an order or contract on 
which a priority rating has been placed under this part by charging 
higher prices, by imposing terms and conditions for such orders or 
contracts different from other generally comparable orders or contracts, 
or by any other means.
    (b) Contracts with priority ratings shall be subject to all 
applicable laws and regulations which govern the making of such 
contracts, including those specified in 10 CFR 211.26(e).


<R05>
Sec. 221.36  Records and reports.

    (a) Each person receiving an order or directive under this part 
shall keep for at least two years from the date of full compliance with 
such order or directive accurate and complete records of crude oil and 
petroleum product deliveries made in accordance with such order or 
directive.
    (b) All records required to be maintained shall be made available 
upon request for inspection and audit by duly authorized representatives

<R05>
Sec. 300.1  General.

    (a) Purpose. The General Guidelines in this part and the Technical 
Guidelines incorporated by reference in Sec. 300.13 govern the 
Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program authorized by section 
1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13385(b)). The 
purpose of the guidelines is to establish the procedures and 
requirements for filing voluntary reports, and to encourage 
corporations, government agencies, non-profit organizations, households 
and other private and public entities to submit annual reports of their 
greenhouse gas emissions, emission reductions, and sequestration 
activities that are complete, reliable and consistent. Over time, it is 
anticipated that these reports will provide a reliable record of the 
contributions reporting entities have made toward reducing their 
greenhouse gas emissions.
    (b) Reporting under the program. (1) Each reporting entity, whether 
or not it intends to register emissions as described in paragraph (c) of 
this section, must:
    (i) File an entity statement that meets the appropriate requirements 
in Sec. 300.5(d) through (f) of this part;
    (ii) Use appropriate emission inventory and emission reduction 
calculation methods specified in the Technical Guidelines (incorporated 
by reference, see Sec. 300.13), and calculate and report the weighted 
average quality rating of any emission inventories it reports;
    (iii) Comply with the record keeping requirements in Sec. 300.9 of 
this part; and
    (iv) Comply with the certification requirements in Sec. 300.10 of 
this part;
    (2) Each reporting entity, whether or not it intends to register 
emissions as described in paragraph (c) of this section, may report 
offset reductions achieved by other entities outside their boundaries as 
long as such reductions are reported separately and calculated in 
accordance with methods specified in the Technical Guidelines. The 
third-party entity that achieved these reductions must agree to their 
being reported as offset reductions, and must also meet all of the 
requirements of reporting that would apply if the third-party entity 
reported directly under the 1605(b) program.
    (3) An entity that intends to register emissions and emission 
reductions must meet the additional requirements referenced in paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (4) An entity that does not intend to register emissions and 
emission reductions may choose to report its emissions and/or emission 
reductions on an entity-wide basis or for selected elements of the 
entity, selected gases or selected sources.
    (5) An entity that does not intend to register emissions may report 
emission inventories for any year back to 1990 and may report emission 
reductions for any year back to 1991, relative to a base period of one 
to four years, ending no earlier than 1990.
    (c) Registration requirements. Entities that seek to register 
reductions must meet the additional requirements in this paragraph; 
although these requirements differ depending on whether the entity is a 
large or small emitter.
    (1) To be eligible for registration, a reduction must have been 
achieved after 2002, unless the entity has committed under the Climate 
Leaders or

[[Page 81]]

Climate VISION programs to reduce its entity-wide emissions relative to 
a base period that ends earlier 2002, but no earlier than 2000.
    (2) A large emitter must submit an entity-wide emission inventory 
that meets or exceeds the minimum quality requirements specified in 
Sec. 300.6(b) and the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, 
see Sec. 300.13). Registered reductions of a large emitter must be 
based on an entity-wide assessment of net emission reductions, 
determined in accordance with Sec. 300.8 and the Technical Guidelines.
    (3) A small emitter must also submit an emission inventory that 
meets minimum quality requirements specified in Sec. 300.6(b) and the 
Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 300.13) and 
base its registered reductions on an assessment of annual changes in net 
emissions. A small emitter, however, may restrict its inventory and 
assessment to a single type of activity, such as forest management, 
building operations or agricultural tillage.
    (4) Reporting entities may, under certain conditions, register 
reductions achieved by other entities:
    (i) Reporting entities that have met the requirements for 
registering their own reductions may also register offset reductions 
achieved by other entities if:
    (A) They have an agreement with the third-party entities to do so 
and these third-party entities have met all of the requirements for 
registration; or
    (B) They were the result of qualified demand management or other 
programs and are calculated in accordance with the action-specific 
method identified in Sec. 300.8(h)(5).
    (ii) Small emitters that serve as an aggregator may register offset 
reductions achieved by non-reporting entities without reporting on their 
own emissions, as long as they have an agreement with the third-party 
entities to do so and these third-party entities have met all of the 
requirements for registration.
    (d) Forms. Annual reports of greenhouse gas emissions, emission 
reductions, and sequestration must be made on forms or software made 
available by the Energy Information Administration of the Department of 
Energy (EIA).
    (e) Status of reports under previous guidelines. EIA continues to 
maintain in its Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases database all 
reports received pursuant to DOE's October 1994 guidelines. Those 
guidelines are available from EIA at http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/
guidelns.html.
    (f) Periodic review and updating of General and Technical 
Guidelines. DOE intends periodically to review the General Guidelines 
and the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 
300.13) to determine whether any changes are warranted; DOE anticipates 
these reviews will occur approximately once every three years. These 
reviews will consider any new developments in climate science or policy, 
the participation rates of large and small emitters in the 1605(b) 
program, the general quality of the data submitted by different 
participants, and any changes to other emissions reporting protocols. 
Possible changes may include, but are not limited to:
    (1) The addition of greenhouse gases that have been demonstrated to 
have significant, quantifiable climate forcing effects when released to 
the atmosphere in significant quantities;
    (2) Changes to the minimum, quantity-weighted quality rating for 
emission inventories;
    (3) Updates to emission inventory methods, emission factors and 
other provisions that are contained in industry protocols or standards. 
The review may also consider updates to any government-developed and 
consensus-based emission factors for which automatic updating is not 
provided in the Technical Guidelines;
    (4) Modifications to the benchmarks or emission conversion factors 
used to calculate avoided and indirect emissions; and
    (5) Changes in the minimum requirements for registered emission 
reductions.


<R05>
Sec. 300.2  Definitions.

    This section provides definitions for commonly used terms in this 
part.
    Activity of a small emitter means, with respect to a small emitter, 
any single category of anthropogenic production,

[[Page 82]]

consumption or other action that releases emissions or results in 
sequestration, the annual changes of which can be assessed generally by 
using a single calculation method.
    Aggregator means an entity that reports to the 1605(b) program on 
behalf of non-reporting entities. An aggregator may be a large or small 
emitter, such as a trade association, non-profit organization or public 
agency.
    Anthropogenic means greenhouse gas emissions and removals that are a 
direct result of human activities or are the result of natural processes 
that have been affected by human activities.
    Avoided emissions means the greenhouse gas emission reductions that 
occur outside the organizational boundary of the reporting entity as a 
direct consequence of changes in the entity's activity, including but 
not necessarily limited to the emission reductions associated with 
increases in the generation and sale of electricity, steam, hot water or 
chilled water produced from energy sources that emit fewer greenhouse 
gases per unit than other competing sources of these forms of 
distributed energy.
    Base period means a period of 1-4 years used to derive the average 
annual base emissions, emissions intensity or other values from which 
emission reductions are calculated.
    Base value means the value from which emission reductions are 
calculated for an entity or subentity. The value may be annual 
emissions, emissions intensity, kilowatt-hours generated, or other value 
specified in the 1605(b) guidelines. It is usually derived from actual 
emissions and/or activity data derived from the base period.
    Biogenic emissions mean emissions that are naturally occurring and 
are not significantly affected by human actions or activity.
    Boundary means the actual or virtual line that encompasses all the 
emissions and carbon stocks that are to be quantified and reported in an 
entity's greenhouse gas inventory, including de minimis emissions. 
Entities may use financial control or another classification method 
based on ownership or control as the means of determining which sources 
or carbon stocks fall within this organizational boundary.
    Carbon dioxide equivalent means the amount of carbon dioxide by 
weight emitted into the atmosphere that would produce the same estimated 
radiative forcing as a given weight of another radiatively active gas. 
Carbon dioxide equivalents are computed by multiplying the weight of the 
gas being measured by its estimated global warming potential.
    Carbon stocks mean the quantity of carbon stored in biological and 
physical systems including: trees, products of harvested trees, 
agricultural crops, plants, wood and paper products and other 
terrestrial biosphere sinks, soils, oceans, and sedimentary and 
geological sinks.
    Climate Leaders means the EPA sponsored industry-government 
partnership that works with individual companies to develop long-term 
comprehensive climate change strategies. Certain Climate Leaders 
Partners have, working with EPA, set a corporate-wide greenhouse gas 
reduction goal and have inventoried their emissions to measure progress 
towards their goal.
    Climate VISION means the public-private partnership initiated 
pursuant to a Presidential directive issued in 2002 that aims to 
contribute to the President's goal of reducing greenhouse gas intensity 
through voluntary frameworks with industry. Climate VISION partners have 
signed an agreement with DOE to implement various climate-related 
actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
    De minimis emissions means emissions from one or more sources and of 
one or more greenhouse gases that, in aggregate, are less than or equal 
to 3 percent of the total annual carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>) 
equivalent emissions of a reporting entity.
    Department or DOE means the U.S. Department of Energy.
    Direct emissions are emissions from sources within the 
organizational boundaries of an entity.
    Distributed energy means electrical or thermal energy generated by 
an entity that is sold or otherwise exported outside of the entity's 
boundaries for use by another entity.

[[Page 83]]

    EIA means the Energy Information Administration within the U.S. 
Department of Energy.
    Emissions means the direct release of greenhouse gases to the 
atmosphere from any anthropogenic (human induced) source and certain 
indirect emissions (releases) specified in this part.
    Emissions intensity means emissions per unit of output, where output 
is defined as the quantity of physical output, or a non-physical 
indicator of an entity's or subentity's productive activity.
    Entity means the whole or part of any business, institution, 
organization, government agency or corporation, or household that:
    (1) Is recognized under any U.S. Federal, State or local law that 
applies to it;
    (2) Is located and operates, at least in part, in the United States; 
and
    (3) The emissions of such operations are released, at least in part, 
in the United States.
    First reduction year means the first year for which an entity 
intends to register emission reductions; it is the year that immediately 
follows the start year.
    Fugitive emissions means uncontrolled releases to the atmosphere of 
greenhouse gases from the processing, transmission, and/or 
transportation of fossil fuels or other materials, such as HFC leaks 
from refrigeration, SF6 from electrical power distributors, and methane 
from solid waste landfills, among others, that are not emitted via an 
exhaust pipe(s) or stack(s).
    Greenhouse gases means the gases that may be reported to the 
Department of Energy under this program. They are:

(1) Carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>)
(2) Methane (CH<INF>4</INF>)

    significant, quantifiable climate forcing effects when released to 
    the atmosphere in significant quantities and for which DOE has 
    established or approved methods for estimating emissions and 
    reductions. (Note: As provided in Sec. 300.6(i), chlorofluorcarbons 
    and other gases with quantifiable climate forcing effects may be 
    reported to the 1605(b) program if DOE has established an 
    appropriate emission inventory or emission reduction calculation 
    method, but reductions of these gases may not be registered.)

    Incidental lands are entity landholdings that are a minor component 
of an entity's operations and are not actively managed for production of 
goods and services, including:
    (1) Transmission, pipeline, or transportation right of ways that are 
not managed for timber production;
    (2) Land surrounding commercial enterprises or facilities; and
    (3) Land where carbon stock changes are determined by natural 
factors.
    Indirect emissions means greenhouse gas emissions from stationary or 
mobile sources outside the organizational boundary that occur as a 
direct consequence of an entity's activity, including but not 
necessarily limited to the emissions associated with the generation of 
electricity, steam and hot/chilled water used by the entity.
    Large emitter means an entity whose annual emissions are more than 
10,000 metric tons of CO<INF>2</INF> equivalent, as determined in 
accordance with Sec. 300.5(c).
    Net emission reductions means the sum of all annual changes in 
emissions, eligible avoided emissions and sequestration of the 
greenhouse gases specifically identified in Sec. 300.6(i), and 
determined to be in conformance with Sec. Sec. 300.7 and 300.8 of this 
part.
    Offset means an emission reduction that is included in a 1605(b) 
report and

[[Page 84]]

meets the requirements of this part, but is achieved by an entity other 
than the reporting entity. Offset reductions must not be reported or 
registered by any other entity and must appear as a separate and 
distinct component of an entity's report. Offsets are not integrated 
into the reporting entity's emissions or net emission reductions.
    Registration means the reporting of emission reductions that the EIA 
has determined meet the qualifications for registered emission 
reductions set forth in the guidelines.
    Reporting entity means an entity that has submitted a report under 
the 1605(b) program that has been accepted by the Energy Information 
Administration.

from the atmosphere, either through biologic processes or physical 
processes.
    Simplified Emission Inventory Tool (SEIT) is a computer-based 
method, to be developed and made readily accessible by EIA, for 
translating common physical indicators into an estimate of greenhouse 
gas emissions.
    Sink means an identifiable discrete location, set of locations, or 
area in which CO<INF>2</INF> or some other greenhouse gas is 
sequestered.
    Small emitter means an entity whose annual emissions are less than 
or equal to 10,000 metric tons of CO<INF>2</INF> equivalent, as 
determined in accordance with Sec. 300.5(c), and that chooses to be 
treated as a small emitter under the guidelines.
    Source means any land, facility, process, vehicle or activity that 
releases a greenhouse gas.
    Start year means the year upon which the initial entity statement is 
based and the last year of the initial base period(s).
    Subentity means a component of any entity, such as a discrete 
business line, facility, plant, vehicle fleet, or energy using system, 
which has associated with it emissions of greenhouse gases that can be 
distinguished from the emissions of all other components of the same 
entity and, when summed with the emissions of all other subentities, 
equal the entity's total emissions.
    Total emissions means the total annual contribution of the 
greenhouse gases (as defined in this section) to the atmosphere by an 
entity, including both direct and indirect entity-wide emissions.
    United States or U.S. means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, 
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and any other territory of the 
United States.


<R05>
Sec. 300.3  Guidance for defining and naming the reporting entity.

    (a) A reporting entity must be composed of one or more businesses, 
public or private institutions or organizations, households, or other 
entities having operations that annually release emissions, at least in 
part, in the United States. Entities may be defined by, as appropriate, 
a certificate of incorporation, corporate charter, corporate filings, 
tax identification number, or other legal basis of identification 
recognized under any Federal, State or local law or regulation. If a 
reporting entity is composed of more than one entity, all of the 
entities included must be responsible to the same management hierarchy 
and all entities that have the same management hierarchy must be 
included in the reporting entity.
    (b) All reporting entities are strongly encouraged to define 
themselves at the highest level of aggregation. To achieve this 
objective, DOE suggests the use of a corporate-level definition of the 
entity, based on filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or 
institutional charters. While reporting at the highest level of 
aggregation is encouraged, DOE recognizes that certain businesses and 
institutions may conclude that reporting at some lower level is 
desirable. Federal agencies are encouraged to report at the agency or 
departmental level, but distinct organizational units (such as a 
Department of the Interior Fish and Wildlife Service National Wildlife 
Refuge) may report directly if authorized by their department or agency. 
Once an entity has determined the level of corporate or institutional 
management at which it will report (e.g., the holding

[[Page 85]]

company, subsidiary, regulated stationary source, state government, 
agency, refuge, etc.), the entity must include all elements of the 
organization encompassed by that management level and exclude any 
organizations that are managed separately. For example, if two 
subsidiaries of a parent company are to be covered by a single report, 
then all subsidiaries of that parent company must also be included. 
Similarly, if a company decides to report on the U.S. and Canadian 
subsidiaries of its North American operations unit, it must also report 
on any other subsidiaries of its North American unit, such as a Mexican 
subsidiary.
    (c) A name for the defined entity must be specified by all 
reporters. For entities that intend to register reductions, this should 
be the name commonly used to represent the activities being reported, as 
long as it is not also used to refer to substantial activities not 
covered by the entity's reports. While DOE believes entities should be 
given considerable flexibility in defining themselves at an appropriate 
level of aggregation, it is essential that the name assigned to an 
entity that intends to register reductions corresponds closely to the 
scope of the operations and emissions covered by its report. If, for 
example, an individual plant or operating unit is reporting as an 
entity, it should be given a name that corresponds to the specific plant 
or unit, and not to the responsible subsidiary or corporate entity. In 
order to distinguish a parent company from its subsidiaries, the name of 
the parent company generally should not be incorporated into the name of 
the reporting subsidiary, but if it is, the name of the parent company 
usually should be secondary.


<R05>
Sec. 300.4  Selecting organizational boundaries.

    (a) Each reporting entity must disclose in its entity statement the 
approach used to establish its organizational boundaries, which should 
be consistent with the following guidelines:
    (1) In general, entities should use financial control as the primary 
basis for determining their organizational boundaries, with financial 
control meaning the ability to direct the financial and operating 
policies of all elements of the entity with a view to gaining economic 
or other benefits from its activities over a period of many years. This 
approach should ensure that all sources, including those controlled by 
subsidiaries, that are wholly or largely owned by the entity are covered 
by its reports. Sources that are under long-term lease of the entity 
may, depending on the provisions of such leases, also be considered to 
be under the entity's financial control. Sources that are temporarily 
leased or operated by an entity generally would not be considered to be 
under its financial control.
    (2) Entities may establish organizational boundaries using 
approaches other than financial control, such as equity share or 
operational control, but must disclose how the use of these other 
approaches results in organizational boundaries that differ from those 
resulting from using the financial control approach.
    (3) Emissions from facilities or vehicles that are partially-owned 
or leased may be included at the entity's discretion, provided that the 
entity has taken reasonable steps to assure that doing so does not 
result in the double counting of emissions, sequestration or emission 
reductions. Emissions reductions or sequestration associated with land, 
facilities or other sources not owned or leased by an entity may not be 
included in the entity's reports under the program unless the entity has 
long-term control over the emissions or sequestration of the source and 
the owner of the source has agreed that the emissions or sequestration 
may be included in the entity's report.
    (4) If the scope of a defined entity extends beyond the United 
States, the reporting entity should use the same approach to determining 
its organizational boundaries in the U.S. and outside the U.S.
    (b) Each reporting entity must keep separate reports on emissions or 
emission reductions that occur within its defined boundaries and those 
that occur outside its defined boundaries. Entities must also keep 
separate reports on emissions and emission reductions that occur outside 
the United

[[Page 86]]

States and those that occur within the United States.
    (c) An entity that intends to register its entity-wide emissions 
reductions must document and maintain its organizational boundary for 
accounting and reporting purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 300.5  Submission of an entity statement.

    (a) Determining the type of reporting entity. The entity statement 
requirements vary by type of reporting entity. For the purposes of these 
guidelines, there are three types of entities:
    (1) Large emitters that intend to register emission reductions;
    (2) Small emitters that intend to register emission reductions; and
    (3) Emitters that intend to report, but not register emission 
reductions.
    (b) Choosing a start year. The first entity statement describes the 
make-up, operations and boundaries of the entity, as they existed in the 
start year.
    (1) For all entities, it is the year immediately preceding the first 
year for which the entity intends to register emission reductions and 
the last year of the initial base period(s).
    (2) For entities intending to register emission reductions, the 
start year may be no earlier than 2002, unless the entity has made a 
commitment to reduce its entity-wide emissions under the Climate Leaders 
or Climate VISION program. An entity that has made such a commitment may 
establish a start year derived from the base period of the commitment, 
as long as it is no earlier than 2000.
    (i) For a large emitter, the start year is the first year for which 
the entity submits a complete emissions inventory under the 1605(b) 
program.
    (ii) The entity's emissions in its start year or its average annual 
emissions over a period of up to four years ending in the start year 
determine whether it qualifies to begin reporting as a small emitter.
    (3) For entities not intending to register reductions, the start 
year may be no earlier than 1990.
    (c) Determining and maintaining large or small emitter reporting 
status. (1) Any entity that intends to register emission reductions can 
choose to participate as a large emitter, but only an entity that has 
demonstrated that its annual emissions are less than or equal to 10,000 
metric tons of CO<INF>2</INF> equivalent may participate as a small 
emitter. To demonstrate that its annual emissions are less than or equal 
to 10,000 metric tons of CO<INF>2</INF> equivalent, an entity must 
submit either an estimate of its emissions during its chosen start year 
or an estimate of its average annual emissions over a continuous period 
not to exceed four years of time ending in its chosen start year, as 
long as the operations and boundaries of the entity have not changed 
significantly during that period.
    (2) An entity must estimate its total emissions using methods 
specified in Chapter 1 of the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 300.13) or by using the Simplified Emission 
Inventory Tool (SEIT) provided by EIA and also discussed in Chapter 1. 
The results of this estimate must be reported to EIA. [Note: emission 
estimates developed using SEIT may not be used to prepare, in whole or 
part, entity-wide emission inventories required for the registration of 
reductions.]
    (3) After starting to report, each small emitter must annually 
certify that the emissions-related operations and boundaries of the 
entity have not changed significantly since the previous report. A new 
estimate of total emissions must be submitted after any significant 
increase in emissions, any change in the operations or boundaries of the 
small emitter, or every five years, whichever occurs first. Small 
emitters with estimated annual emissions of over 9,000 metric tons of 
CO<INF>2</INF> equivalent should re-estimate and submit their emissions 
annually. If an entity determines that it must report as a large 
emitter, then it must continue to report as a large emitter in all 
future years in order to ensure a consistent time series of reports. 
Once a small emitter becomes a large emitter, it must begin reporting in 
conformity with the reporting requirements for large emitters.
    (d) Entity statements for large emitters intending to register 
reductions. When a large emitter intending to register emission 
reductions first reports under these guidelines, it must provide the

[[Page 87]]

following information in its entity statement:
    (1) The name to be used to identify the participating entity;
    (2) The legal basis of the named entity;
    (3) The criteria used to determine:
    (i) The organizational boundaries of the entity, if other than 
financial control; and
    (ii) The sources of emissions included or excluded from the entity's 
reports, such as sources excluded as de minimis emissions;
    (4) The names of any parent or holding companies the activities of 
which will not be covered comprehensively by the entity's reports;
    (5) The names of any large subsidiaries or organizational units 
covered comprehensively by the entity's reports. All subsidiaries of the 
entity must be covered by the entity's reports, but only large 
subsidiaries must be specifically identified in the entity statement;
    (6) A list of each country where operations occur, if the entity is 
including any non-U.S. operations in its report;
    (7) A description of the entity and its primary U.S. economic 
activities, such as electricity generation, product manufacturing, 
service provider or freight transport; for each country listed under 
paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the large emitter should describe the 
economic activity in that country.
    (8) A description of the types of emission sources or sinks to be 
covered in the entity's emission inventories, such as fossil fuel power 
plants, manufacturing facilities, commercial office buildings or heavy-
duty vehicles;
    (9) The names of other entities that substantially share the 
ownership or operational control of sources that represent a significant 
part of the reporting entity's emission inventories, and a certification 
that, to the best of the certifier's knowledge, the direct greenhouse 
gas emissions and sequestration in the entity's report are not included 
in reports filed by any of these other entities to the 1605(b) program; 
and
    (10) Identification of the start year.
    (e) Entity statements for small emitters intending to register 
reductions. When a small emitter intending to register emission 
reductions first reports under these guidelines, it must provide the 
following information in its entity statement:
    (1) The name to be used to identify the participating entity;
    (2) The legal basis of the named entity;
    (3) An identification of the entity's control over the activities 
covered by the entity's reports, if other than financial control;
    (4) The names of any parent or holding companies the activities of 
which will not be covered comprehensively by the entity's reports;
    (5) An identification or description of the primary economic 
activities of the entity, such as agricultural production, forest 
management or household operation; if any of the economic activities 
covered by the entity's reports occur outside the U.S., a listing of 
each country in which such activities occur;
    (6) An identification or description of the specific activity (or 
activities) and the emissions, avoided emissions or sequestration 
covered by the entity's report, such as landfill gas recovery or forest 
sequestration;
    (7) A certification that, to the best of the certifier's knowledge, 
the direct greenhouse gas emissions and sequestration in the entity's 
report are not included in reports filed by any other entities reporting 
to the 1605(b) program; and
    (8) Identification of the start year.
    (f) Entity statements for reporting entities not registering 
reductions. When a participant not intending to register emission 
reductions first reports under this part, it must, at a minimum, provide 
the following information in its entity statement:
    (1) The name to be used to identify the reporting entity;
    (2) The legal basis of the entity;
    (3) An identification of the entity's control over the activities 
covered by the entity's reports, if other than financial control;
    (4) A description of the entity and its primary economic activities, 
such as electricity generation, product manufacturing, service provider, 
freight transport, agricultural production, forest management or 
household operation; if any of the economic activities covered by the 
entity's reports occur

[[Page 88]]

outside the United States, a listing of each country in which such 
activities occur; and
    (5) A description of the types of emission sources or sinks, such as 
fossil fuel power plants, manufacturing facilities, commercial office 
buildings or heavy-duty vehicles, covered in the entity's reports of 
emissions or emission reductions.
    (g) Changing entity statements. (1) Reporting entities are required 
to annually review and, if necessary, update their entity statements.
    (2) From time to time, a reporting entity may choose to change the 
scope of activities included within the entity's reports or the level at 
which the entity wishes to report. A reporting entity may also choose to 
change its organizational boundaries, its base period, or other elements 
of its entity statement. For example, companies buy and sell business 
units, or equity share arrangements may change. In general, DOE 
encourages changes in the scope of reporting that expand the coverage of 
an entity's report and discourages changes that reduce the coverage of 
such reports unless they are caused by divestitures or plant closures. 
Any such changes should be reported in amendments to the entity 
statement, and major changes may warrant or require changes in the base 
values used to calculate emission reductions and, in some cases, the 
entity's base periods. Changes in the scope of reporting made on or 
before May 31 of a given calendar year must be reflected in the report 
submitted covering emissions and reductions for the following calendar 
year. Reporting entities may choose to postpone incorporating changes in 
the scope of reporting made after May 31 until submitting the report 
covering emissions and reductions for the year after the following 
calendar year. However, in no case should there be an interruption in 
the annual reports of entities registering emission reductions. Chapter 
2 of the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 
300.13) provides more specific guidance on how such changes should be 
reflected in entity statements, reports, and emission reduction 
calculations.
    (h) Documenting changes in amended entity statements. A reporting 
entity's entity statement in subsequent reports should focus primarily 
on changes since the previous report. Specifically, the subsequent 
entity statement should report the following information:
    (1) For significant changes in the reporting entity's scope or 
organizational boundaries, the entity should document:
    (i) The acquisition or divestiture of discrete business units, 
subsidiaries, facilities, and plants;
    (ii) The closure or opening of significant facilities;
    (iii) The transfer of economic activity to or from specific 
subentities covered by the entity's reports, such as the transfer of 
operations to non-U.S. subsidiaries;
    (iv) Significant changes in land holdings (applies to entities 
reporting on greenhouse gas emissions or sequestration related to land 
use, land use change, or forestry);
    (v) Whether the reporting entity is reporting at a higher level of 
aggregation than it did in the previous report, and if so, a listing of 
the subsidiary entities that are now aggregated under a revised 
conglomerated entity, including a listing of any non-U.S. operations to 
be added and the specific countries in which these operations are 
located; and
    (vi) Changes in its activities or operations (e.g., changes in 
output, contractual arrangements, equipment and processes, outsourcing 
or insourcing of significant activities) that are likely to have a 
significant effect on emissions, together with an explanation of how it 
believes the changes in economic activity influenced its reported 
emissions or sequestrations.


<R05>
Sec. 300.6  Emissions inventories.

    (a) General. The objective of an emission inventory is to provide a 
full accounting of an entity's emissions for a particular year, 
including direct emissions of the first six categories of gases listed 
in the definition of ``greenhouse gases'' in Sec. 300.2, indirect 
emissions specified in paragraph (e) of this section, and all 
sequestration or other changes in carbon stocks. An emission

[[Page 89]]

inventory must be prepared in accordance with Chapter 1 of the Technical 
Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 300.13). An inventory 
does not include avoided emissions or any offset reductions, and is not 
subsequently adjusted to reflect future acquisitions, divestitures or 
other changes to the reporting entity (although a reporting entity often 
makes these types of adjustments when calculating emission reductions 
under the guidelines). Entity-wide inventories are a prerequisite for 
the registration of emission reductions by entities with average annual 
emissions of more than 10,000 metric tons of CO<INF>2</INF> equivalent. 
Entities that have average annual emissions of less than or equal to 
10,000 metric tons of CO<INF>2</INF> equivalent are eligible to register 
emission reductions associated with specific activities without also 
reporting an inventory of the total emissions, but such entities should 
inventory and report the emissions associated with the specific 
activity(ies) they do cover in their reports.
    (b) Quality requirements for emission inventories. The Technical 
Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 300.13) usually 
identify more than one acceptable method of measuring or estimating 
greenhouse gas emissions. Each acceptable method is rated A, B, C or D, 
with A methods usually corresponding to the highest quality method 
available and D methods representing the lowest quality method that may 
be used. Each letter is assigned a numerical rating reflecting its 
relative quality, 4 for A methods, 3 for B methods, 2 for C methods and 
1 for D methods. Entities that intend to register emission reductions 
must use emission inventory methods that result in a quantity-weighted 
average quality rating of at least 3.0.
    (1) Entities may at any time choose to modify the measurement or 
estimation methods that they use for their current or future year 
emission inventories. Such modifications would enable entities to 
gradually improve the quality of the ratings over time, but prior year 
inventories may be modified only to correct significant errors.
    (2) Entities that have had their emission quantities and the 
quantity-weighted quality rating of their emissions inventory 
independently verified may report their emissions and average quality 
ratings by greenhouse gas, indirect emissions and sequestration, rather 
than by source or sink category.
    (3) Entities that certify that they have used only A or B methods, 
may forego indicating in their reports the quality ratings of the 
methods used and may forego calculating the quantity-weighted average 
quality of their emission inventories.
    (c) Using estimation methods not included in the Technical 
Guidelines. An entity may obtain DOE approval for the use of an 
estimation method not included in the Technical Guidelines (incorporated 
by reference, see Sec. 300.13) if the method covers sources not 
described in the Technical Guidelines, or if the method provides more 
accurate results for the entity's specific circumstances than the 
methods described in the Technical Guidelines. If an entity wishes to 
propose the use of a method that is not described in the Technical 
Guidelines, the entity must provide a written description of the method, 
an explanation of how the method is implemented (including data 
requirements), empirical evidence of the method's validity and accuracy, 
and a suggested rating for the method to DOE's Office of Policy and 
International Affairs (with a copy to EIA). DOE reserves the right to 
deny the request, or to assign its own rating to the method. By 
submitting this information, the entity grants permission to DOE to 
incorporate the method in a future revision of the Technical Guidelines.
    (d) Direct emissions inventories. Direct greenhouse gas emissions 
that must be reported are the emissions resulting from stationary or 
mobile sources within the organizational boundaries of an entity, 
including but not limited to emissions resulting from combustion of 
fossil fuels, process emissions, and fugitive emissions. Process 
emissions (e.g., PFC emissions from aluminum production) must be 
reported along with fugitive emissions (e.g., leakage of greenhouse 
gases from equipment).
    (e) Inventories of indirect emissions associated with purchased 
energy. (1) To provide a clear incentive for the users

[[Page 90]]

of electricity and other forms of purchased energy to reduce demand, an 
entity must include the indirect emissions from the consumption of 
purchased electricity, steam, and hot or chilled water in the entity's 
inventory as indirect emissions. To avoid double counting among 
entities, the entity must report all indirect emissions separately from 
its direct emissions. Entities should use the methods for quantifying 
indirect emissions specified in the Technical Guidelines (incorporated 
by reference, see Sec. 300.13).
    (2) Entities may choose to report other forms of indirect emissions, 
such as emissions associated with employee commuting, materials consumed 
or products produced, although such other indirect emissions may not be 
included in the entity's emission inventory and may not be the basis for 
registered emission reductions. All such reports of other forms of 
indirect emissions must be distinct from reports of indirect emissions 
associated with purchased energy and must be based on emission 
measurement or estimation methods identified in the Technical Guidelines 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 300.13) or approved by DOE.
    (f) Entity-level inventories of changes in terrestrial carbon 
stocks. Annual changes in managed terrestrial carbon stocks should be 
comprehensively assessed and reported across the entity, and the net 
emissions resulting from such changes included in the entity's emissions 
inventory. Entities should use the methods for estimating changes in 
managed terrestrial carbon stocks specified in the Technical Guidelines 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 300.13).
    (g) Treatment of de minimis emissions and sequestration. (1) 
Although the goal of the entity-wide reporting requirement is to provide 
an accurate and comprehensive estimate of total emissions, there may be 
small emissions from certain sources that are unduly costly or otherwise 
difficult to measure or reliably estimate annually. An entity may 
exclude particular sources of emissions or sequestration if the total 
quantities excluded represent less than or equal to 3 percent of the 
total annual CO<INF>2</INF> equivalent emissions of the entity. The 
entity must identify the types of emissions excluded and provide an 
estimate of the annual quantity of such emissions using methods 
specified in the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 300.13) or by using the Simplified Emissions Inventory Tool 
(SEIT). The results of this estimate of the entity's total excluded 
annual emissions must be reported to DOE together with the entity's 
initial entity statement.
    (2) After starting to report, each reporting entity that excludes 
from its annual reports any de minimis emissions must re-estimate the 
quantity of excluded emissions after any significant increase in such 
emissions, or every five years, whichever occurs sooner.
    (h) Separate reporting of domestic and international emissions. Non-
U.S. emissions included in an entity's emission inventory must be 
separately reported and clearly distinguished from emissions originating 
in the U.S. Entities must identify any country-specific factors used in 
the preparation of such reports.
    (i) Covered gases. Entity-wide emissions inventories must include 
the emissions of the first six categories of named gases listed in the 
definition of ``greenhouse gases'' in Sec. 300.2. Entities may report 
chlorofluorocarbons and other greenhouse gases with quantifiable climate 
forcing effects as long as DOE has established a method for doing so, 
but such gases must be reported separately and emission reductions, if 
any, associated with such other gases are not eligible for registration.
    (j) Units for reporting. Emissions and sequestration should be 
reported in terms of the mass (not volume) of each gas, using metric 
units (e.g., metric tons of methane). Entity-wide and subentity 
summations of emissions and reductions from multiple sources must be 
converted into CO<INF>2</INF> equivalent units using the global warming 
potentials for each gas in the International Panel on Climate Change's 
Third Assessment (or most recent) Report, as specified in the Technical 
Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 300.13). Entities 
should specify the units used (e.g., kilograms, or metric tons). 
Entities may need to use the standard conversion factors specified in 
the Technical Guidelines to

[[Page 91]]

convert existing data into the common units required in the entity-level 
report. Emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity must be 
calculated by region (from the list provided by DOE in the Technical 
Guidelines) or country, if outside the United States. Consumption of 
purchased steam or chilled/hot water must be reported according to the 
type of system and fuel used to generate it (from the list provided by 
DOE in the Technical Guidelines). Entities must convert purchased energy 
to CO<INF>2</INF> equivalents using the conversion factors in the 
Technical Guidelines. Entities should also provide the physical 
quantities of each type of purchased energy covered by their reports.


<R05>
Sec. 300.7  Net emission reductions.

    (a) Entities that intend to register emission reductions achieved 
must comply with the requirements of this section. Entities may 
voluntarily follow these procedures if they want to demonstrate the 
achievement of net, entity-wide reductions for years prior to the 
earliest year permitted for registration. Only large emitters must 
follow the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, but small 
emitters may do so voluntarily. Only entities that qualify as small 
emitters may use the special procedures in paragraph (c) of this 
section. Entities seeking to register emission reductions achieved by 
other entities (offsets) must certify that these emission reductions 
were calculated in a manner consistent with the requirements of 
paragraph (d) of this section and use the emission reduction calculation 
methods identified in Sec. 300.8. All entities seeking to register 
emission reductions must comply with the requirements of paragraph (e) 
of this section. Only reductions in the emissions of the first six 
categories of gases listed in the definition of ``greenhouse gases'' in 
Sec. 300.2 are eligible for registration.
    (b) Assessing net emission reductions for large emitters. (1) 
Entity-wide reporting is a prerequisite for registering emission 
reductions by entities with average annual emissions of more than 10,000 
metric tons of CO<INF>2</INF> equivalent. Net annual entity-wide 
emission reductions must be based, to the maximum extent practicable, on 
a full assessment and sum total of all changes in an entity's emissions, 
eligible avoided emissions and sequestration relative to the entity's 
established base period(s). This assessment must include all entity 
emissions, including the emissions associated with any non-U.S. 
operations covered by the entity statement, although the reductions 
achieved by non-U.S. operations must be separately totaled prior to 
being integrated with the net emission reductions achieved by U.S. 
operations. It must include the annual changes in the total emissions of 
the entity, including the total emissions of each of the subentities 
identified in its entity statement. All changes in emissions, avoided 
emissions, and sequestration must be determined using methods that are 
consistent with the guidelines described in Sec. 300.8 of this part.
    (2) If it is not practicable to assess the changes in net emissions 
resulting from certain entity activities using at least one of the 
methods described in Sec. 300.8 of this part, the entity may exclude 
them from its estimate of net emission reductions. The entity must 
identify as one or more distinct subentities the sources of emissions 
excluded for this reason and describe the reasons why it was not 
practicable to assess the changes that had occurred. DOE believes that 
few emission sources will be excluded for this reason, but has 
identified at least two situations where such an exclusion would be 
warranted. For example, it is likely to be impossible to assess the 
emission changes associated with a new manufacturing plant that produces 
a product for which the entity has no historical record of emissions or 
emissions intensity (emissions per unit of product output). However, 
once the new plant has been operational for at least a full year, a base 
period and base value(s) for the new plant could be established and its 
emission changes assessed in the following year. Until the emission 
changes of this new subentity can be assessed, it should be identified 
in the entity's report as a subentity for which no assessment of 
emission changes is practicable. The other example involves a subentity 
that has reduced its

[[Page 92]]

output below the levels of its base period. In such a case, the 
subentity could not use the absolute emissions method and may also be 
unable to identify an effective intensity metric or other method.
    (3) In calculating its net annual emission reductions, an entity 
should exclude any emissions or sequestration that have been excluded 
from the entity's inventory. The entity should also exclude all de 
minimis and biogenic emissions that are excluded from the entity's 
inventory of greenhouse gas emissions from its assessments of emission 
changes.
    (c) Assessing emission reductions for entities with small emissions. 
(1) Entities with average annual emissions of less than or equal to 
10,000 metric tons of CO<INF>2</INF> equivalent are not required to 
inventory their total emissions or assess all changes in their 
emissions, eligible avoided emissions and sequestration to qualify for 
registered reductions. These entities may register emission reductions 
that have occurred since 2002 and that are associated with one or more 
specific activities, as long as they:
    (i) Perform a complete assessment of the annual emissions and 
sequestration associated with each of the activities upon which they 
report, using methods that meet the same quality requirements applicable 
to entity-wide emission inventories; and
    (ii) Determine the changes in the emissions, eligible avoided 
emissions or sequestration associated with each of these activities.
    (2) An entity reporting as a small emitter must report on one or 
more specific activities and is encouraged, but not required to report 
on all activities occurring within the entity boundary. Examples of 
small emitter activities include: vehicle operations; product 
manufacturing processes; building operations or a distinct part thereof, 
such as lighting; livestock operations; crop management; and power 
generation. For example, a farmer managing several woodlots and also 
producing a wheat crop may report emission reductions associated with 
managing an individual woodlot. However, the farmer must also assess and 
report the net sequestration resulting from managing all the woodlots 
within the entity's boundary. The small emitter is not required to 
report on emissions or reductions associated with growing the wheat 
crop.
    (3) A small emitter must certify that the reductions reported were 
not caused by actions likely to cause increases in emissions elsewhere 
within the entity's operations. This certification should be based on an 
assessment of the likely direct and indirect effects of the actions 
taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
    (d) Net emission reductions achieved by other entities (offset 
reductions or emission reductions submitted by aggregators). A reporting 
entity or aggregator under certain conditions may report or register all 
or some of the net emission reductions achieved by entities that choose 
not to report under the section 1605(b) program. In all cases, an 
agreement must exist between the reporting entity or aggregator and the 
other entity that specifies the quantity of the emission reductions (or 
increases) achieved by the other entity that may be reported or 
registered as an offset reduction by the reporting entity or aggregator. 
A large emitter that is reporting on behalf of other entities must meet 
all of the requirements applicable to large emitters, including 
submission of an entity statement, an emissions inventory, and an 
entity-wide assessment of emission reductions. If an aggregator is a 
small emitter, it may choose to report only on the activities, emissions 
and emission reductions of the entities on behalf of which it is 
reporting and not to report on any of its own activities or emission 
reductions. The reporting entity or aggregator must include in its 
report all of the information on the other entity, including an entity 
statement, an emissions inventory (when required), and an assessment of 
emission reductions that would be required if the other entity were 
directly reporting to EIA. The net emissions reductions (or increases) 
of each other entity will be evaluated separately by EIA to determine 
whether they are eligible for registration in accordance with the 
guidelines of this part. Those registered reductions (or increases) 
assigned by the

[[Page 93]]

other entity, by agreement, to a reporting entity or aggregator will be 
included in EIA's summary of all registered offset reductions for that 
entity or aggregator. If the agreement between the reporting entity and 
other entity is discontinued, for any reason, the reporting entity must 
inform EIA and must identify any emission reductions previously reported 
that could be attributable to an increase in the carbon stocks of the 
other entity. Such reductions will be removed by EIA from the records of 
the reporting entity's offset reductions.
    (e) Net emission reductions to be reported by other entities as 
offset reductions. Entities must identify in their report the quantity 
of any net emission reductions covered by the report, if any, that 
another entity will report as an offset reduction, including the name of 
the other entity;
    (f) Adjusting for year-to-year increases in net emissions. (1) 
Normally, net annual emission reductions for an entity are calculated by 
summing the net annual changes in emissions, eligible avoided emissions 
and sequestration, as determined using the calculation methods 
identified in Sec. 300.8 and according to the procedures described in 
paragraph (b) of this section for large emitters, paragraph (c) for 
small emitters of this section for small emitters, and paragraph (d) of 
this section for offsets. However, if the entity experienced a net 
increase in emissions for one or more years, these increases must be 
reported and taken into account in calculating any future year 
reductions. If the entity subsequently achieves net annual emission 
reductions, the net increases experienced in the preceding year(s) must 
be more than offset by these reductions before the entity can once again 
register emission reductions. For example, if an entity achieved a net 
emission reduction of 5,000 metric tons of CO<INF>2</INF> equivalent in 
its first year, a net increase of 2,000 metric tons in its second year, 
and a net reduction of 3,000 metric tons in its third year, it would be 
able to register a 5,000 metric ton reduction in its first year, no 
reduction in its second year, and a 1,000 metric ton reduction in its 
third year (3,000-2,000). The entity must file full reports for each of 
these three years. Its report for the second year would indicate the net 
increase in emissions and this increase would be noted in EIA's summary 
of the entity's report for that year and for any future year, until the 
emissions increase was entirely offset by subsequent emission 
reductions. If this same entity achieved a net reduction of only 1,000 
metric tons in its third year, it would not be able to register 
additional reductions until it had, in some future year, offset more 
than its second year increase of 2,000 metric tons.

<R05>
Sec. 300.8  Calculating emission reductions.

    (a) Choosing appropriate emission reduction calculation methods. (1) 
An entity must choose the method or methods it will use to calculate 
emission reductions from the list provided in paragraph (h) of this 
section. Each of the calculation methods has special characteristics 
that make it applicable to only certain types of emissions and 
activities. An entity should select the appropriate calculation method 
based on several factors, including:
    (i) How the entity's subentities are defined;
    (ii) How the reporter will gather and report emissions data; and
    (iii) The availability of other types of data that might be needed, 
such as production or output data.
    (2) For some entities, a single calculation method will be 
sufficient, but many entities may need to apply more than one method 
because discrete components of the entity require different calculation 
methods. In such a case, the entity will need to select a method for 
each subentity (or discrete component of the entity with identifiable 
emission or reductions). The emissions and output measure (generally a 
physical measure) of each subentity must be clearly distinguished and 
reported separately. Guidance on the selection and specification of 
calculation methods is provided in Chapter 2 of the Technical Guidelines 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 300.13).

[[Page 94]]

    (b) Identifying subentities for calculating reductions. If more than 
one calculation method is to be used, an entity must specify the portion 
of the entity (the subentity) to which each method will be applied. Each 
subentity must be clearly identified. From time to time, it may be 
necessary to modify existing or create new subentities. The entity must 
provide to EIA a full description of such changes, together with an 
explanation of why they were required.
    (c) Choosing a base period for calculating reductions. In general, 
the base period used in calculating emission reductions is the single 
year or up to four-year period average immediately preceding the first 
year of calculated emission reductions.
    (d) Establishing base values. To calculate emission reductions, an 
entity must establish a base value against which to compare reporting 
year performance. The minimum requirements for base values for each type 
of calculation method are specified in Chapter 2 of the Technical 
Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 300.13). In most cases, 
an historic base value, derived from emissions or other data gathered 
during the base period, is the minimum requirement specified. Entities 
may, however, choose to establish base values that are more stringent 
than the base values derived from the methods specified in Chapter 2 of 
the Technical Guidelines as long as their report indicates the rationale 
for the alternative base value and demonstrates that it would result in 
a smaller quantity of emission reductions.
    (e) Emission reduction and subentity statements. For each subentity, 
an entity must submit to EIA the following information:
    (1) An identification and description of the method used to 
calculate emission reductions, including:
    (i) The type of calculation method;
    (ii) The measure of output used (if any); and
    (iii) The method-specific base period for which any required base 
value will be calculated.
    (2) The base period used in calculating reductions. When an entity 
starts to report, the base period used in calculating reductions must 
end in the start year. However, over time the reporting entity may find 
it necessary to revise or establish new base periods and base values in 
response to significant changes in processes or output of the subentity.
    (3) A description of the subentity and its primary economic activity 
or activities, such as electricity generation, product manufacturing, 
service provider, freight transport, or household operation; and
    (4) A description of the emission sources or sinks covered, such as 
fossil fuel power plants, manufacturing facilities, commercial office 
buildings or heavy-duty vehicles.
    (f) Changes in calculation methods, base periods and base values. 
When significant changes occur in the composition or output of reporting 
entities, a reporting entity may need to change previously specified 
calculation methods, base periods or base values. A reporting entity 
should make such changes only if necessary and it should fully document 
the reasons for any changes. The Technical Guidelines (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 300.13) describe when such changes should be made 
and what information on such changes must be provided to DOE. In 
general, such changes should not result in any alterations to previously 
reported or registered emission reductions. A reporting entity may alter 
previously reported or registered emission reductions only if necessary 
to correct significant errors.
    (g) Continuous reporting. To ensure that the summation of entity 
annual reports accurately represents net, multi-year emission 
reductions, an entity must submit a report every year, beginning with 
the first reduction year. An entity may use a specific base period to 
determine emission reductions in a given future year only if the entity 
has submitted qualified reports for each intervening year. If an 
interruption occurs in the annual reports of an entity, the entity must 
subsequently report on all missing years prior to qualifying for the 
registration of additional emission reductions.

[[Page 95]]

    (h) Calculation methods. An entity must calculate any change in 
emissions, avoided emissions or sequestration using one or more of the 
methods described in this paragraph and in the Technical Guidelines 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 300.13).
    (1) Changes in emissions intensity. An entity may use emissions 
intensity as a basis for determining emission reductions as long as the 
entity selects a measure of output that is:
    (i) A reasonable indicator of the output produced by the entity;
    (ii) A reliable indicator of changes in the entity's activities;
    (iii) Related to emissions levels; and
    (iv) Any appropriate adjustments for acquisitions, divestitures, 
insourcing, outsourcing, or changes in products have been made, as 
described in the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 300.13).
    (2) Changes in absolute emissions. An entity may use changes in the 
absolute (actual) emissions (direct and/or indirect) as a basis for 
determining net emission reductions as long as the entity makes only 
those adjustments required by the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 300.13). An entity intending to register emission 
reductions may use this method only if the entity demonstrates in its 
report that any reductions derived from such changes were not achieved 
as a result of reductions in the output of the entity, and certifies 
that emission reductions are not the result of major shifts in the types 
of products or services produced. Entities may report, but not register, 
such reductions even if the output associated with such emissions is 
declining.
    (3) Changes in carbon storage (for actions within entity 
boundaries). An entity may use changes in carbon storage as a basis for 
determining net emission reductions as long as the entity uses 
estimation and measurement methods that comply with the Technical 
Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 300.13), and has 
included an assessment of the net changes in all sinks in its inventory.
    (4) Changes in avoided emissions (for actions within entity 
boundaries). An entity may use changes in avoided emissions to determine 
its emission reductions. Avoided emissions eligible to be included in 
the calculation of net emission reductions that qualify for registration 
include those associated with the sale of electricity, steam, hot water 
or chilled water generated from non-emitting or low-emitting sources as 
a basis for determining net emission reductions as long as:
    (i) The measurement and calculation methods used comply with the 
Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 300.13);
    (ii) The entity certifies that any increased sales were not 
attributable to the acquisition of a generating facility that had been 
previously operated, unless the entity's base period includes generation 
values from the acquired facility's operation prior to its acquisition; 
and
    (iii) Generators of distributed energy that have net emissions in 
their base period and intend to report reductions resulting from changes 
in eligible avoided emissions, use a method specified in the Technical 
Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 300.13) that integrates 
the calculation of reductions resulting from both changes in emissions 
intensity and changes in avoided emissions.
    (5) Action-specific emission reductions (for actions within entity 
boundaries). A number of source- or situation-specific methods are 
provided in the Technical Guidelines and these methods must be used to 
assess the annual changes in emissions for the specific sources or 
situation addressed by these methods. In addition, a generic action-
specific method is identified in the Technical Guidelines. An entity 
intending to register reductions may use the generic action-specific 
approach only if it is not possible to measure accurately emission 
changes by using one of the methods identified in paragraphs (h)(1) 
through (h)(4) of this section. Entities that intend to register 
reductions and that use the generic action-specific approach must 
explain why it is not possible to use any of these other methods. An 
entity not intending to register reductions may use the generic action-
specific method to determine emission reductions, as long as the entity 
demonstrates that the estimate is based on analysis that:

[[Page 96]]

    (i) Uses output, utilization and other factors that are consistent, 
to the maximum extent practicable, with the action's actual performance 
in the year for which reductions are being reported;
    (ii) Excludes any emission reductions that might have resulted from 
reduced output or were caused by actions likely to be associated with 
increases in emissions elsewhere within the entity's operations; and
    (iii) Uses methods that are in compliance with the Technical 
Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 300.13).
    (i) Summary description of actions taken to reduce emissions. Each 
reported emission reduction must be accompanied by an identification of 
the types of actions that were the likely cause of the reductions 
achieved. Entities are also encouraged to include in their reports 
information on the benefits and costs of the actions taken to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions, such as the expected rates of return, life 
cycle costs or benefit to cost ratios, using appropriate discount rates.
    (j) Emission reductions associated with plant closings, voluntary 
actions and government (including non-U.S. regulatory regimes) 
requirements. (1) Each report of emission reductions must indicate 
whether the reported emission reductions were the result, in whole or in 
part, of plant closings, voluntary actions, or government requirements. 
EIA will presume that reductions that were not the result of plant 
closings or government requirements are the result of voluntary actions.
    (2) If emission reductions were, in whole or in part, the direct 
result of plant closings that caused a decline in output, the report 
must identify the reductions as such; these reductions do not qualify 
for registration. EIA will presume that reductions calculated using the 
emissions intensity method do not result from a decline in output.
    (3) If the reductions were associated, in whole or part, with U.S. 
or non-U.S. government requirements, the report should identify the 
government requirement involved and the effect these requirements had on 
the reported emission reductions. If, as a result of the reduction, a 
non-U.S. government issued to the reporting entity a credit or other 
financial benefit or regulatory relief, the report should identify the 
government requirement involved and describe the specific form of 
benefit or relief provided.
    (k) Determining the entity responsible for emission reductions. The 
entity that EIA will presume to be responsible for emission reduction, 
avoided emission or sequestered carbon is the entity with financial 
control of the facility, land or vehicle which generated the reported 
emissions, generated the energy that was sold so as to avoid other 
emissions, or was the place where the sequestration action occurred. If 
control is shared, reporting of the associated emission reductions 
should be determined by agreement between the entities involved so as to 
avoid double-counting; this agreement must be reflected in the entity 
statement and in any report of emission reductions. EIA will presume 
that an entity is not responsible for any emission reductions associated 
with a facility, property or vehicle excluded from its entity statement.


<R05>
Sec. 300.9  Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

    (a) Starting to report under the guidelines. An entity may report 
emissions and sequestration on an annual basis beginning in any year, 
but no earlier than the base period of 1987-1990 specified in the Energy 
Policy Act of 1992. To be recognized under these guidelines, all reports 
must conform to the measurement methods established by the Technical 
Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 300.13).
    (b) Revisions to reports submitted under the guidelines. (1) Once 
EIA has accepted a report under this part, it may be revised by the 
reporting entity only under the circumstances specified in this 
paragraph and related provisions of the Technical Guidelines 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 300.13). In general:
    (i) Revised reports may be submitted to correct errors that have a 
significant effect on previously estimated emissions or emission 
reductions; and
    (ii) Emission inventories may be revised in order to create a 
consistent time series based on improvements in

[[Page 97]]

the emission estimation or measurement techniques used.
    (2) Reporting entities must provide the corrected or improved data 
to EIA, together with an explanation of the significance of the change 
and its justification.
    (3) If a change in calculation methods (for inventories or 
reductions) is made for a particular year, the reporting entity must, if 
feasible, revise its base value to assure methodological consistency 
with the reporting year value.
    (c) Definition and deadline for annual reports. Entities must report 
emissions on a calendar year basis, from January 1 to December 31. To be 
included in the earliest possible EIA annual report of greenhouse gas 
emissions reported under this part, entity reports that have not been 
independently verified must be submitted to DOE no later than July 1 for 
emissions occurring during the previous calendar year. Reports that have 
been independently verified must be submitted by September 1 for 
emissions occurring during the previous year.
    (d) Recordkeeping. Entities intending to register reductions must 
maintain adequate supporting records of base period data for the 
duration of their participation in the 1605(b) program. Supporting 
records for all reporting year data must be maintained for at least 
three years subsequent to the relevant reporting year to enable 
verification of all information reported. The records should document 
the basis for the entity's report to EIA, including:
    (1) The content of entity statements, including the identification 
of the specific facilities, buildings, land holding and other operations 
or emission sources covered by the entity's reports and the legal, 
equity, operational and other bases for their inclusion;
    (2) Information on the identification and assessment of changes in 
entity boundaries, processes or products that might have to be reported 
to EIA;
    (3) Any agreements or relevant communications with other entities or 
third parties regarding the reporting of emissions or emission 
reductions associated with sources the ownership or operational control 
of which is shared;
    (4) Information on the methods used to measure or estimate 
emissions, and the data collection and management systems used to gather 
and prepare this data for inclusion in reports;
    (5) Information on the methods used to calculate emission 
reductions, including the basis for:
    (i) The selection of the specific output measures used, and the data 
collection and management systems used to gather and prepare output data 
for use in the calculation of emission reductions;
    (ii) The selection and modification of all base years, base periods 
and baselines used in the calculation of emission reductions;
    (iii) Any baseline adjustments made to reflect acquisitions, 
divestitures or other changes;
    (iv) Any models or other estimation methods used; and
    (v) Any internal or independent verification procedures undertaken.
    (e) Confidentiality. DOE will protect trade secret and commercial or 
financial information that is privileged or confidential as provided in 
5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). An entity must clearly indicate in its 1605(b) 
report the information for which it requests confidentiality. DOE will 
handle requests for confidentiality of information submitted in 1605(b) 
reports in accordance with the process established in DOE's Freedom of 
Information regulations at 10 CFR Sec. 1004.11.


<R05>
Sec. 300.10  Certification of reports.

    (a) General requirement and certifying official: All reports 
submitted to EIA must include a certification statement, as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, signed by a certifying official of the 
reporting entity. A household report may be certified by one of its 
members. All other reports must be certified by the chief executive 
officer, agency head, or an officer or employee of the entity who is 
responsible for reporting the entity's compliance with environmental 
regulations.
    (b) Certification statement requirements. All entities, whether 
reporting or registering reductions, must certify the following:
    (1) The information reported is accurate and complete;

[[Page 98]]

    (2) The information reported has been compiled in accordance with 
this part; and
    (3) The information reported is consistent with information 
submitted in prior years, if any, or any inconsistencies with prior 
year's information are documented and explained in the entity statement.
    (c) Additional requirements for registering. The certification 
statement of an entity registering reductions must also certify that:
    (1) The entity took reasonable steps to ensure that direct 
emissions, emission reductions, and/or sequestration reported are 
neither double counted nor reported by any other entity. Reasonable 
steps include telephone, fax, letter, or e-mail communications to ensure 
that another entity does not intend to report the same emissions, 
emission reductions, and/or sequestration to DOE. Direct communications 
of this kind with participants in demand-side management or other 
programs directed at very small emitters are not required;
    (2) Any emission reductions reported or registered by the entity 
that were achieved by another entity (other than a very small emitter 
that participated in a demand-side management or other program) are 
included in the entity's report only if:
    (i) The other entity does not intend to report or register theses 
reductions directly;
    (ii) There exists a written agreement with each other entity 
providing that the reporting entity is the entity entitled to report or 
register these emission reductions; and
    (iii) The information reported on the other entity would meet the 
requirements of this part if the entity were reporting directly to DOE;
    (3) None of the emissions, emission reductions, or sequestration 
reported were produced by shifting emissions to other entities or to 
non-reporting parts of the entity;
    (4) None of any reported changes in avoided emissions associated 
with the sale of electricity, steam, hot or chilled water generated from 
non-emitting or low-emitting sources are attributable to the acquisition 
of a generating facility that has been previously operated, unless the 
entity's base period includes generation values from the acquiring 
facility's operation prior to its acquisition;
    (5) The entity maintains records documenting the analysis and 
calculations underpinning the data reported on this form and records 
documenting the analysis and calculations underpinning the base values 
used in calculating annual reductions are maintained in accordance with 
Sec. 300.9(d) of this part; and
    (6) The entity has, or has not, obtained independent verification of 
the report, as described in Sec. 300.11.


<R05>
Sec. 300.11  Independent verification.

    (a) General. Entities are encouraged to have their annual reports 
reviewed by independent and qualified auditors, as described in 
paragraphs (b), (c), and (f) of this section.
    (b) Qualifications of verifiers. (1) DOE envisions that independent 
verification will be performed by professional verifiers (i.e., 
individuals or companies that provide verification or ``attestation'' 
services). EIA will consider a report to the program to be independently 
verified if:
    (i) The lead individual verifier and other members of the 
verification team are accredited by one or more independent and 
nationally-recognized accreditation programs, described in paragraph (c) 
of this section, for the types of professionals needed to determine 
compliance with DOE's 1605(b) guidelines;
    (ii) The lead verifier has experience managing an auditing or 
verification process, including the recruitment and allocation of other 
individual verifiers, and has been empowered to make decisions relevant 
to the provision of a verification statement; and
    (iii) All members of a verification team have education, training 
and/or professional experience that matches the tasks performed by the 
individual verifiers, as deemed necessary by the verifier accreditation 
program.
    (2) As further guidance, all members of the verification team should 
be familiar with:
    (i) The subject matter covered by the scope of the verification;
    (ii) The requirements of this part;

[[Page 99]]

    (iii) Greenhouse gas emission and emission reduction quantification;
    (iv) Data and information auditing sampling methods; and
    (v) Risk assessment and methodologies and materiality analysis 
procedures outlined by other domestic and international standards.
    (3) An individual verifier should have a professional degree or 
accreditation in engineering (environmental, industrial, chemical), 
accounting, economics, or a related field, supplemented by specific 
training and/or experience in emissions reporting and accounting, and 
should have his or her qualifications and continuing education 
periodically reviewed by an accreditation program. The skills required 
for verification are often cross-disciplinary. For example, an 
individual verifier reviewing a coal electric utility should be 
knowledgeable about mass balance calculations, fuel purchasing 
accounting, flows and stocks of coals, coal-fired boiler operation, and 
issues of entity definition.
    (4) Companies that provide verification services must use 
professionals that possess the necessary skills and proficiency levels 
for the types of entities for which they provide verification services. 
Continuing training may be required to ensure all individuals have up-
to-date knowledge regarding the tasks they perform.
    (c) Qualifications of organizations accrediting verifiers. 
Organizations that accredit individual verifiers must be nationally 
recognized certification programs. They may include, but are not limited 
to the: American Institute of Certified Public Accountants; American 
National Standards Institute's Registrar Accreditation Board program for 
Environmental Management System auditors (ANSI-RAB-EMS); Board of 
Environmental, Health and Safety Auditor Certification: California 
Climate Action Registry; Clean Development Mechanism Executive Board; 
and the United Kingdom Accreditation Scheme.
    (d) Scope of verification. (1) As part of any independent 
verification, qualified verifiers must use their expertise and 
professional judgment to verify for accuracy, completeness and 
consistency with DOE's guidelines of:
    (i) The content of entity statements, annual reports and the 
supporting records maintained by the entity;
    (ii) The representation in entity statements (or lack thereof) of 
any significant changes in entity boundaries, products, or processes;
    (iii) The procedures and methods used to collect emissions and 
output data, and calculate emission reductions (for entities with widely 
dispersed operations, this process should include on-site reviews of a 
sample of the facilities);
    (iv) Relevant personnel training and management systems; and
    (v) Relevant quality assurance/quality control procedures.
    (2) DOE expects qualified verifiers to refer to the growing body of 
literature on methods of evaluating the elements listed in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section, such as the California Climate Action Registry 
Certification Protocol, the Climate Leaders Inventory Management Plan 
Checklist, and the draft ISO 14064.3 Protocol for Validation, 
Verification and Certification.
    (e) Verification statement. Both the verifier and, if relevant, an 
officer of the company providing the verification service must sign the 
verification statement. The verification statement shall attest to the 
following:
    (1) The verifier has examined all components listed in paragraph (d) 
of this section;
    (2) The information reported in the verified entity report and this 
verification statement is accurate and complete;
    (3) The information reported by the entity has been compiled in 
accordance with this part;
    (4) The information reported on the entity report is consistent with 
information submitted in prior years, if any, or any inconsistencies 
with prior year's information are documented and explained in the entity 
statement;
    (5) The verifier used due diligence to assure that direct emissions, 
emission reductions, and/or sequestration reported are not reported by 
any other entity;
    (6) Any emissions, emission reductions, or sequestration that were

[[Page 100]]

achieved by a third-party entity are included in this report only if 
there exists a written agreement with each third party indicating that 
they have agreed that the reporting entity should be recognized as the 
entity entitled to report these emissions, emission reductions, or 
sequestration;
    (7) None of the emissions, emission reductions, or sequestration 
reported was produced by shifting emissions to other entities or to non-
reporting parts of the entity;
    (8) No reported changes in avoided emissions associated with the 
sale of electricity, steam, hot or chilled water generated from non-
emitting or low-emitting sources are attributable to the acquisition of 
a generating facility that has been previously operated, unless the base 
year generation values are derived from records of the facility's 
operation prior to its acquisition;
    (9) The verifying entity has procedures in place for the maintenance 
of records that are sufficient to document the analysis and calculations 
underpinning this verification. The verifying entity shall maintain such 
records related to base period data submitted by the reporting entity 
for the duration of the reporting entity's participation in the 1605(b) 
program and records related to all other verified data for a period of

<R05>
Sec. 300.12  Acceptance of reports and registration of entity emission reductions.

    (a) Acceptance of reports. EIA will review all reports to ensure 
they are consistent with this part and with the Technical Guidelines 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 300.13). EIA will also review all 
reports for completeness, internal consistency, arithmetic accuracy and 
plausibility. Subject to the availability of adequate resources, EIA 
intends to notify entities of the acceptance or rejection of any report 
within six months of its receipt.
    (b) Registration of emission reductions. EIA will review each 
accepted report to determine if emission reductions were calculated 
using an acceptable base period (usually ending no earlier than 2002), 
and to confirm that the report complies with the other provisions of 
this part. EIA will also review its records to verify that the reporting 
entity has submitted accepted annual reports for each year between the 
establishment of its base period and the year covered by the current 
report. EIA will notify the entity that reductions meeting these 
requirements have been credited to the entity as ``registered 
reductions'' which can be held by the reporting entity for use 
(including transfer to other entities) in the event a future program 
that recognizes such reductions is enacted into law.
    (c) Rejection of reports. If EIA does not accept a report or if it 
determines that emission reductions intended for registration do not 
qualify, EIA will return the report to the sender with an explanation of 
its inadequacies. The reporting entity may resubmit a modified report 
for further consideration at any time.
    (d) EIA database and summary reports. The Administrator of EIA will 
establish a publicly accessible database composed of all reports that 
meet the definitional, measurement, calculation, and certification 
requirements of these guidelines. EIA will maintain separate subtotals 
of direct emissions, indirect emissions and carbon fluxes. A portion of 
the database will provide summary information on the emissions and 
registered emission reductions of each reporting entity.

Sec. 430.2  Definitions.

                                * * * * *

    ARM/simulation adjustment factor means a factor used as part of a 
DOE-approved alternative rating method (ARM) to improve the accuracy of 
the calculated ratings for untested split-system central air 
conditioners or heat pumps. The adjustment factor associated with each 
outdoor unit must be set such that it reduces the difference between the 
SEER (HSPF) determined using the ARM and a split-system combination 
tested in accordance with Sec. 430.24(m)(1). The ARM/simulation 
adjustment factor is an integral part of the ARM and must be a DOE-
approved element in accordance with 10 CFR 430.24(m)(4) to (m)(6).

                                * * * * *

    Indoor unit means a component of a split-system central air 
conditioner or heat pump that is designed to transfer heat between the 
refrigerant and the indoor air, and which consists of an indoor coil, a 
cooling mode expansion device, and may include an air moving device.

                                * * * * *

    Outdoor unit means a component of a split-system central air 
conditioner or heat pump that is designed to transfer heat between the 
refrigerant and the outdoor air, and which consists of an outdoor coil, 
compressor(s), an air moving device, and in addition for heat pumps, a 
heating mode expansion device, reversing valve, and defrost controls.

                                * * * * *

    Private labeler means an owner of a brand or trademark on the label 
of a consumer

[[Page 130]]

product which bears a private label. A consumer product bears a private 
label if:
    (1) Such product (or its container) is labeled with the brand or 
trademark of a person other than a manufacturer of such product;
    (2) The person with whose brand or trademark such product (or 
container) is labeled has authorized or caused such product to be so 
labeled; and
    (3) The brand or trademark of a manufacturer of such product does 
not appear on such label.

                                * * * * *

    Tested combination means a multi-split system with multiple indoor 
coils having the following features:
    (1) The basic model of a system used as a tested combination shall 
consist of one outdoor unit, with one or more compressors, that is 
matched with between 2 and 5 indoor units; for multi-split systems, each 
of these indoor units shall be designed for individual operation.
    (2) The indoor units shall--
    (i) Represent the highest sales model family, or another indoor 
model family if the highest sales model family does not provide 
sufficient capacity (see ii);
    (ii) Together, have a nominal capacity that is between 95% and 105% 
of the nominal capacity of the outdoor unit;
    (iii) Not, individually, have a capacity that is greater than 50% of 
the nominal capacity of the outdoor unit;
    (iv) Operate at fan speeds that are consistent with the 
manufacturer's specifications; and
    (v) All be subject to the same minimum external static pressure 
requirement (i.e., 0 inches of water column for non-ducted, see Table 2 
in Appendix M to Subpart B of this part for ducted indoor units) while 
being configurable to produce the same static pressure at the exit of 
each outlet plenum when manifolded as per section 2.4.1 of Appendix M.

Any change to be made to the alternative rating method, must be approved 
by DOE prior to its use for rating.
    (8) Manufacturers who choose to use computer simulation or 
engineering analysis for determining measures of energy consumption 
under paragraphs (m)(2)(ii) and (m)(5) of this section shall permit 
representatives of the Department of Energy to inspect for verification 
purposes the simulation method or methods used. This inspection may 
include conducting simulations to predict the performance of particular 
condenser-evaporator coil combinations specified by DOE, analysis of 
previous simulations conducted by a manufacturer, or both.
    (n)(1) For each basic model \1\ of furnaces, other than basic models

    (i) Any represented value of estimated annual operating cost, energy 
consumption or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for 
which consumers would favor lower values shall be no less than the 
higher of (A) the mean of the sample, or (B) the upper 97\1/2\ percent 
confidence limit of the true mean divided by 1.05, and
    (ii) Any represented value of the annual fuel utilization efficiency 
or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which 
consumers would favor higher values shall be no greater than the lower

identical intermediate sections and combustion chambers, represented 
values of measures of energy consumption shall be determined by either--
    (i) A linear interpolation of data obtained for the smallest and 
largest capacity units of the family, or
    (ii) Testing a sample of sufficient size to insure that (A) any 
represented value of estimated annual operating cost, energy consumption 
or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which

determined by actual testing, the values determined by testing will be 
assumed to be the more reliable values.
    (6) In calculating the measures of energy consumption for each unit 
tested, use the design heating requirement corresponding to the mean of 
the capacities of the units of the sample.
    (o)(1) For each basic model \1\ of vented home heating equipment 
(not including furnaces) a sample of sufficient size shall be tested to 
insure that--

    (r)(1) For each basic model of general service fluorescent lamp and 
incandescent reflector lamp, samples of production lamps shall be tested 
and the results for all samples shall be averaged for a 12-month period. 
A minimum sample of 21 lamps shall be tested. The manufacturer shall 
randomly select a minimum of three lamps from each month of production 
for a minimum of 7 out of the 12-month period. In the instance where 
production occurs during fewer than 7 of such 12 months, the 
manufacturer shall randomly select a 3 or more lamps from each month of 
production, where the number of lamps selected for each month shall be 
distributed as evenly as practicable among the months of production to 
attain a minimum sample of 21 lamps. Any represented value of lamp 
efficacy of a basic model shall be based on the sample and shall be no 
greater than the lower of the mean of the sample or the lower 95-percent

Sec. 430.24  Units to be tested.

                                * * * * *

    (m)(1) For central air conditioners and heat pumps, each single-
package system and each condensing unit (outdoor unit) of a split-
system, when combined with a selected evaporator coil (indoor unit) or a 
set of selected indoor units, must have a sample of sufficient size 
tested in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart. The 
represented values for any model of single-package system, any model of 
a tested split-system combination, any model of a tested mini-split 
system combination, or any model of a tested multi-split system 
combination must be assigned such that --

[[Page 152]]

    (i) Any represented value of estimated annual operating cost, energy 
consumption or other measure of energy consumption of the central air 
conditioner or heat pump for which consumers would favor lower values 
must be no less than the higher of:
    (A) The mean of the sample; or
    (B) The upper 90-percent confidence limit of the true mean divided 
by 1.05;
    (ii) Any represented value of the energy efficiency or other measure 
of energy consumption of the central air conditioner or heat pump for 
which consumers would favor higher values must be no greater than the 
lower of:
    (A) The mean of the sample; or
    (B) The lower 90-percent confidence limit of the true mean divided 
by 0.95;
    (iii) For heat pumps, all units of the sample population must be 
tested in both the cooling and heating modes and the results used for 
determining the heat pump's certified SEER and HSPF ratings in 
accordance with paragraph (m)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (2) For split-system air conditioners and heat pumps, the condenser-
evaporator coil combination selected for tests pursuant to paragraph 
(m)(1) of this section shall include the evaporator coil that is likely 
to have the largest volume of retail sales with the particular model of 
condensing unit. For mini-split condensing units that are designed to 
always be installed with more than one indoor unit, a ``tested 
combination'' as defined in 10 CFR 430.2 shall be used for tests 
pursuant to paragraph (m)(1) of this section. For multi-split systems, 
each model of condensing unit shall be tested with two different sets of 
indoor units. For one set, a ``tested combination'' composed entirely of 
non-ducted indoor units shall be used. For the second set, a ``tested 
combination'' composed entirely of ducted indoor units shall be used. 
Components of similar design may be substituted without requiring 
additional testing if the represented measures of energy consumption 
continue to satisfy the applicable sampling provisions of paragraphs 
(m)(1)(i) and (m)(1)(ii) of this section. However, for any split-system 
air conditioner having a single-speed compressor, the condenser-
evaporator coil combination selected for tests pursuant to paragraph 
(m)(1) of this section shall include the indoor coil-only unit that is 
likely to have the largest volume of retail sales with the particular 
model of outdoor unit. This coil-only requirement does not apply to 
split-system air conditioners that are only sold and installed with 
blower-coil indoor units, specifically mini-splits, multi-splits, and 
through-the-wall units. This coil-only requirement does not apply to any 
split-system heat pumps. For every other split-system combination that 
includes the same model of condensing unit but a different model of 
evaporator coil and for every other mini-split and multi-split system 
that includes the same model of condensing unit but a different set of 
evaporator coils, whether the evaporator coil(s) is manufactured by the 
same manufacturer or by a component manufacturer, either--
    (i) A sample of sufficient size, comprised of production units or 
representing production units, must be tested as complete systems with 
the resulting ratings for the outdoor unit-indoor unit(s) combination 
obtained in accordance with paragraphs (m)(1)(i) and (m)(1)(ii) of this 
section; or
    (ii) The representative values of the measures of energy efficiency 
must be assigned as follows,
    (A) Using an alternative rating method (ARM) that has been approved 
by DOE in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (m)(4) through 
(m)(6) of this section; or
    (B) For multi-split systems composed entirely of non-ducted indoor 
units, set equal to the system tested in accordance with paragraph 
(m)(1) of this section whose tested combination was entirely non-ducted 
indoor units;
    (C) For multi-split systems composed entirely of ducted indoor 
units, set equal to the system tested in accordance with paragraph 
(m)(1) of this section whose tested combination was entirely ducted 
indoor units; and
    (D) For multi-split systems having a mix of non-ducted and ducted 
indoor units, set equal to the mean of the values for the two systems -- 
one having the tested combination of all non-ducted units and the second 
having the tested combination of all ducted indoor units -- tested in 
accordance with paragraph (m)(1) of this section.
    (3) Whenever the representative values of the measures of energy 
consumption, as determined by the provisions of paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of 
this section, do not agree within 5 percent of the representative values 
of the measures of energy consumption as determined by actual testing, 
the representative values determined by actual testing must be used to 
comply with section 323(c) of the Act or to comply with rules under 
section 324 of the Act.
    (4) The basis of the ARM referred to in paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of this 
section must be a representation of the test data and calculations of a 
mechanical vapor-compression refrigeration cycle. The major components 
in the refrigeration cycle must be modeled as ``fits'' to manufacturer 
performance data or by graphical or tabular performance data. Heat 
transfer characteristics of coils may be modeled as a function of face 
area, number of rows, fins per inch, refrigerant circuitry, air-flow 
rate and entering-air enthalpy. Additional performance-related 
characteristics to be considered may include type of expansion device, 
refrigerant flow rate through the expansion device, power of the indoor 
fan and cyclic-degradation coefficient. Ratings for untested 
combinations must be derived from

[[Page 153]]

the ratings of a combination tested in accordance with paragraph (m)(1) 
of this section. The seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) and/or 
heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF) ratings for an untested 
combination must be set equal to or less than the lower of the SEER and/
or HSPF calculated using the applicable DOE-approved alternative rating 
method (ARM). If the method includes an ARM/simulation adjustment 
factor(s), determine the value(s) of the factors(s) that yield the best 
match between the SEER/HSPF determined using the ARM versus the SEER/
HSPF determined from testing in accordance with paragraph (m)(1) of this 
section. Thereafter, apply the ARM using the derived adjustment 
factor(s) only when determining the ratings for untested combinations 
having the same outdoor unit.
    (5) Manufacturers or private labelers who elect to use an ARM for 
determining measures of energy consumption under paragraphs 
(m)(2)(ii)(A) and (m)(4) of this section must submit a request for DOE 
to review the ARM. Send the request to the Assistant Secretary of Energy 
Efficiency and Renewable Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., 
Washington, DC 20585-0121. Approval must be received from the Assistant 
Secretary to use the ARM before the ARM may be used for rating split-
system central air conditioners and heat pumps. If a manufacturer has a 
DOE-approved ARM for products also distributed in commerce by a private 
labeler, the ARM may also be used by the private labeler for rating 
these products. Once an ARM is approved, DOE may contact a manufacturer 
to learn if their ARM has been modified in any way and to verify that 
the ARM is being applied as approved. DOE will give follow-up priority 
to individual combinations having questionably high ratings (e.g., a 
coil-only system having a rating that exceeds the rating of a coil-only 
highest sales volume combination by more than 6 percent).
    (6) Each request to DOE for approval of an alternative rating method 
must include:
    (i) The name, mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail address 
of the official representing the manufacturer.
    (ii) Complete documentation of the alternative rating method to 
allow DOE to evaluate its technical adequacy. The documentation must 
include a description of the methodology, state any underlying 
assumptions, and explain any correlations. The documentation should 
address how the method accounts for the cyclic-degradation coefficient, 
the type of expansion device, and, if applicable, the indoor fan-off 
delay. The requestor must submit any computer programs--including 
spreadsheets--having less than 200 executable lines that implement the 
ARM. Longer computer programs must be identified and sufficiently 
explained, as specified above, but their inclusion in the initial 
submittal package is optional. Applicability or limitations of the ARM 
(e.g., only covers single-speed units when operating in the cooling 
mode, covers units with rated capacities of 3 tons or less, not 
applicable to the manufacturer's product line of non-ducted systems, 
etc.) must be stated in the documentation.
    (iii) Complete test data from laboratory tests on four mixed (i.e., 
non-highest-sales-volume combination) systems per each ARM.
    (A) The four mixed systems must include four different indoor units 
and at least two different outdoor units. A particular model of outdoor 
unit may be tested with up to two of the four indoor units. The four 
systems must include two low-capacity mixed systems and two high-
capacity mixed systems. The low-capacity mixed systems may have any 
capacity. The rated capacity of each high-capacity mixed system must be 
at least a factor of two higher than its counterpart low-capacity mixed 
system. The four mixed systems must meet the applicable energy 
conservation standard in Sec. 430.32(c) in effect at the time of the 
rating.
    (B) The four indoor units must come from at least two different coil 
families, with a maximum of two indoor units coming from the same coil 
family. Data for two indoor units from the same coil family, if 
submitted, must come from testing with one of the ``low-capacity mixed 
systems'' and one of the ``high capacity mixed systems.'' A mixed system 
indoor coil may come from the same coil family as the highest-sales-
volume-combination indoor unit (i.e., the ``matched'' indoor unit) for 
the particular outdoor unit. Data on mixed systems where the indoor unit 
is now obsolete will be accepted towards the ARM-validation submittal 
requirement if it is from the same coil family as other indoor units 
still in production.
    (C) The first two sentences of paragraph (m)(6)(iii)(B) of this 
section do not apply if the manufacturer offers indoor units from only 
one coil family. In this case only, all four indoor coils must be 
selected from this one coil family. If approved, the ARM will be 
specifically limited to applications for this one coil family.
    (iv) All product information on each mixed system indoor unit, each 
matched system indoor unit, and each outdoor unit needed to implement 
the proposed ARM. The calculated ratings for the four mixed systems, as 
determined using the proposed ARM, must be provided along with any other 
related information that will aid the verification process.
    (v) If request for approval is for an updated ARM, manufacturers 
must identify modifications made to the ARM since the last submittal, 
including any ARM/simulation adjustment factor(s) added since the ARM 
was last approved by DOE.
    (7) Manufacturers that elect to use an alternative rating method for 
determining

[[Page 154]]

measures of energy consumption under paragraphs (m)(2)(ii)(A) and (m)(4) 
of this section must either subject a sample of their units to 
independent testing on a regular basis, e.g., through a voluntary 
certification program, or have the representations reviewed and 
certified by an independent state-registered professional engineer who 
is not an employee of the manufacturer. The registered professional 
engineer is to certify that the results of the alternative rating 
procedure accurately represent the energy consumption of the unit(s). 
The manufacturer is to keep the registered professional engineer's 
certifications on file for review by DOE for as long as said combination 
is made available for sale by the manufacturer. Any proposed change to 
the alternative rating method must be approved by DOE prior to its use 
for rating.
    (8) Manufacturers who choose to use computer simulation or 
engineering analysis for determining measures of energy consumption 
under paragraphs (m)(2)(ii)(A) and (m)(4) through (m)(7) of this section 
must permit representatives of the Department of Energy to inspect for 
verification purposes the simulation method(s) and computer program(s) 
used. This inspection may include conducting simulations to predict the 
performance of particular outdoor unit `` indoor unit combinations 
specified by DOE, analysis of previous simulations conducted by the 
manufacturer, or both.

Sec. 430.27  Petitions for waiver and applications for interim waiver.

    (a)(1) Any interested person may submit a petition to waive for a 
particular basic model any requirements of Sec. 430.23, or of any 
appendix to this subpart, upon the grounds that the basic model contains 
one or more design characteristics which either prevent testing of the 
basic model according to the prescribed test procedures, or the 
prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner so 
unrepresentative of its true energy consumption characteristics, or 
water consumption characteristics (in the case of faucets, showerheads, 
water closets, and urinals) as to provide materially inaccurate 
comparative data.
    (2) Any interested person who has submitted a Petition for Waiver as 
provided in this subpart may also file an Application for Interim Waiver 
of the applicable test procedure requirements.
    (b)(1) A Petition for Waiver shall be submitted, in triplicate, to 
the Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energy, United 
States Department of Energy. Each Petition for Waiver shall:
    (i) Identify the particular basic model(s) for which a waiver is 
requested, the design characteristic(s) constituting the grounds for the 
petition, and the specific requirements sought to be waived and shall 
discuss in detail the need for the requested waiver;
    (ii) Identify manufacturers of all other basic models marketed in 
the United States and known to the petitioner to incorporate similar 
design characteristic(s);
    (iii) Include any alternate test procedures known to the petitioner 
to evaluate in a manner representative of the energy consumption 
characteristics, or water consumption characteristics (in the case of 
faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals) of the basic model; 
and
    (iv) Be signed by the petitioner or by an authorized representative. 
In accordance with the provisions set forth

[[Page 155]]

in 10 CFR 1004.11, any request for confidential treatment of any 
information contained in a Petition for Waiver or in supporting 
documentation must be accompanied by a copy of the petition, application 
or supporting documentation from which the information claimed to be 
confidential has been deleted. DOE shall publish in the Federal Register 
the petition and supporting documents from which confidential 
information, as determined by DOE, has been deleted in accordance with 
10 CFR 1004.11 and shall solicit comments, data and information with 
respect to the determination of the petition. Any person submitting 
written comments to DOE with the respect to a Petition for Waiver shall 
also send a copy of such comments to the petitioner. In accordance with 
paragraph (i) of this section, a petitioner may submit a rebuttal 
statement to the Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable 
Energy.
    (2) An Application for Interim Waiver shall be submitted in 
triplicate, with the required three copies of the Petition for Waiver, 
to the Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energy, U.S. 
Department of Energy. Each Application for Interim Waiver shall 
reference the Petition for Waiver by identifying the particular basic 
model(s) for which a waiver and temporary exception are being sought. 
Each Application for Interim Waiver shall demonstrate likely success of 
the Petition for Waiver and shall address what economic hardship and/or 
competitive disadvantage is likely to result absent a favorable 
determination on the Application for Interim Waiver. Each Application 
for Interim Waiver shall be signed by the applicant or by an authorized 
representative.
    (c)(1) Each petitioner, after filing a Petition for Waiver with DOE, 
and after the Petition for Waiver has been published in the Federal 
Register, shall, within five working days of such publication, notify in 
writing all known manufacturers of domestically marketed units of the 
same product type (as listed in section 322(a) of the Act) and shall 
include in the notice a statement that DOE has published in the Federal 
Register on a certain date the Petition for Waiver and supporting 
documents from which confidential information, if any, as determined by 
DOE, has been deleted in accordance with 10 CFR 1004.11. Each 
petitioner, in complying with the requirements of this paragraph, shall 
file with DOE a statement certifying the names and addresses of each 
person to whom a notice of the Petition for Waiver has been sent.

or subsequent to, a Petition for Waiver with DOE, shall concurrently 
notify in writing all known manufacturers of domestically marketed units 
of the same product type (as listed in Section 322(a) of the Act) and 
shall include in the notice a copy of the Petition for Waiver and a copy 
of the Application for Interim Waiver. In complying with this section, 
each applicant shall in the written notification include a statement 
that the Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energy will 
receive and consider timely written comments on the Application for 
Interim Waiver. Each applicant, upon filing an Application for Interim 
Waiver, shall in complying with the requirements of this paragraph 
certify to DOE that a copy of these documents have been sent to all 
known manufacturers of domestically marked units of the same product 
type (as listed in section 322(a) of the Act). Such certification shall 
include the names and addresses of such persons. Each applicant also 
shall comply with the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
with respect to the petition for waiver.
    (d) Any person submitting written comments to DOE with respect to an 
Application for Interim Waiver shall also send a copy of the comments to 
the applicant.
    (e) If administratively feasible, applicant shall be notified in 
writing of the disposition of the Application for Interim Waiver within 
15 business days of receipt of the application. Notice of DOE's 
determination on the Application for Interim Waiver shall be published 
in the Federal Register.
    (f) The filing of an Application for Interim Waiver shall not 
constitute grounds for noncompliance with any requirements of this 
subpart, until an Interim Waiver has been granted.

[[Page 156]]

    (g) An Interim Waiver from test procedure requirements will be 
granted by the Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energy 
if it is determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship 
if the Application for Interim Waiver is denied, if it appears likely 
that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant 
Secretary determines that it would be desirable for public policy 
reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the 
Petition for Waiver.
    (h) An interim waiver will terminate 180 days after issuance or upon 
the determination on the Petition for Waiver, whichever occurs first. An 
interim waiver may be extended by DOE for 180 days. Notice of such 
extension and/or any modification of the terms or duration of the 
interim waiver shall be published in the Federal Register, and shall be 
based on relevant information contained in the record and any comments 
received subsequent to issuance of the interim waiver.
    (i) Following publication of the Petition for Waiver in the Federal 
Register, a petitioner may, within 10 working days of receipt of a copy 
of any comments submitted in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, submit a rebuttal statement to the Assistant Secretary for 
Conservation and Renewable Energy. A petitioner may rebut more than one 
response in a single rebuttal statement.
    (j) The petitioner shall be notified in writing as soon as 
practicable of the disposition of each Petition for Waiver. The 
Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energy shall issue a 
decision on the petition as soon as is practicable following receipt and 
review of the Petition for Waiver and other applicable documents, 
including, but not limited to, comments and rebuttal statements.
    (k) The filing of a Petition for Waiver shall not constitute grounds 
for noncompliance with any requirements of this subpart, until a waiver 
or interim waiver has been granted.
    (l) Waivers will be granted by the Assistant Secretary for 
Conservation and Renewable Energy, if it is determined that the basic 
model for which the waiver was requested contains a design 
characteristic which either prevents testing of the basic model 
according to the prescribed test procedures, or the prescribed test 
procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner so unrepresentative 
of its true energy consumption characteristics, or water consumption 
characteristics (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and 
urinals) as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers 
may be granted subject to conditions, which may include adherence to 
alternate test procedures specified by the Assistant Secretary for 
Conservation and Renewable Energy. The Assistant Secretary shall consult 
with the Federal Trade Commission prior to granting any waiver, and 
shall promptly publish in the Federal Register notice of each waiver 
granted or denied, and any limiting conditions of each waiver granted.
    (m) Within one year of the granting of any waiver, the Department of 
Energy will publish in the Federal Register a notice of proposed 
rulemaking to amend its regulations so as to eliminate any need for the 
continuation of such waiver. As soon thereafter as practicable, the 
Department of Energy will publish in the Federal Register a final rule. 
Such waiver will terminate on the effective date of such final rule.
    (n) In order to exhaust administrative remedies, any person 
aggrieved by an action under this section must file an appeal with the 
DOE's Office of Hearings and Appeals as provided in 10 CFR part 1003, 
subpart C.

   Sec. Appendix A1 to Subpart B of Part 430--Uniform Test Method for 
Measuring the Energy Consumption of Electric Refrigerators and Electric 
                          Refrigerator-Freezers

                             1. Definitions

    1.1 ``HRF-1-1979'' means the Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers standard for household refrigerators, combination 
refrigerator-freezers, and household freezers, also approved as an 
American National Standard as a revision of ANSI B 38.1-1970.

[[Page 157]]

    1.2 ``Adjusted total volume'' means the sum of (i) the fresh food 
compartment volume as defined in HRF-1-1979 in cubic feet, and (ii) the 
product of an adjustment factor and the net freezer compartment volume 
as defined in HRF-1-1979, in cubic feet.
    1.3 ``Anti-sweat heater'' means a device incorporated into the 
design of a refrigerator or refrigerator-freezer to prevent the 
accumulation of moisture on exterior surfaces of the cabinet under 
conditions of high ambient humidity.
    1.4 ``All-refrigerator'' means an electric refrigerator which does 
not include a compartment for the freezing and long time storage of food 
at temperatures below 32 [deg]F. (0.0 [deg]C.). It may include a 
compartment of 0.50 cubic feet capacity (14.2 liters) or less for the 
freezing and storage of ice.
    1.5 ``Cycle'' means the period of 24 hours for which the energy use 
of an electric refrigerator or electric refrigerator-freezer is 
calculated as though the consumer activated compartment temperature 
controls were set so that the desired compartment temperatures were 
maintained.
    1.6 ``Cycle type'' means the set of test conditions having the 
calculated effect of operating an electric refrigerator or electric 
refrigerator-freezer for a period of 24 hours, with the consumer 
activated controls other than those that control compartment 
temperatures set to establish various operating characteristics.
    1.7 ``Standard cycle'' means the cycle type in which the anti-sweat 
heater control, when provided, is set in the highest energy consuming 
position.
    1.8 ``Automatic defrost'' means a system in which the defrost cycle 
is automatically initiated and terminated, with resumption of normal 
refrigeration at the conclusion of the defrost operation. The system 
automatically prevents the permanent formation of frost on all 
refrigerated surfaces. Nominal refrigerated food temperatures are 
maintained during the operation of the automatic defrost system.
    1.9 ``Long-time Automatic Defrost'' means an automatic defrost 
system where successive defrost cycles are separated by 14 hours or more 
of compressor-operating time.
    1.10 ``Stabilization Period'' means the total period of time during 
which steady-state conditions are being attained or evaluated.
    1.11 ``Variable defrost control'' means a long-time automatic 
defrost system (except the 14-hour defrost qualification does not apply) 
where successive defrost cycles are determined by an operating condition 
variable or variables other than solely compressor operating time. This 
includes any electrical or mechanical device. Demand defrost is a type 
of variable defrost control.
    1.12 ``Externally vented refrigerator or refrigerator-freezer'' 
means an electric refrigerator or electric refrigerator-freezer that: 
has an enclosed condenser or an enclosed condenser/compressor 
compartment and a set of air ducts for transferring the exterior air 
from outside the building envelope into, through and out of the 
refrigerator or refrigerator-freezer cabinet; is capable of mixing 
exterior air with the room air before discharging into, through, and out 
of the condenser or condenser/compressor compartment; includes 
thermostatically controlled dampers or controls that enable the mixing 
of the exterior and room air at low outdoor temperatures, and the 
exclusion of exterior air when the outdoor air temperature is above 80 
[deg]F or the room air temperature; and may have a thermostatically 
actuated exterior air fan.

                           2. Test Conditions

    2.1 Ambient temperature. The ambient temperature shall be 90.0 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 [deg]F. (32.3<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.6 [deg]C.) 
during the stabilization period and during the test period. The ambient 
temperature shall be 80<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 [deg]F dry bulb and 67 
[deg]F wet bulb during the stabilization period and during the test 
period when the unit is tested in accordance with section 3.3.
    2.2 Operational conditions. The electric refrigerator or electric 
refrigerator-freezer shall be installed and its operating conditions 
maintained in accordance with HRF-1-1979, section 7.2 through section 
7.4.3.3, except that the vertical ambient temperature gradient at 
locations 10 inches (25.4 cm) out from the centers of the two sides of 
the unit being tested is to be maintained during the test. Unless the 
area is obstructed by shields or baffles, the gradient is to be 
maintained from 2 inches (5.1 cm) above the floor or supporting platform 
to a height one foot (30.5 cm) above the unit under test. Defrost 
controls are to be operative and the anti-sweat heater switch is to be 
``on'' during one test and ``off'' during a second test. Other 
exceptions are noted in 2.3, 2.4, and 5.1 below.
    2.3 Conditions for automatic defrost refrigerator-freezers. For 
automatic defrost refrigerator-freezers, the freezer compartments shall 
not be loaded with any frozen food packages. Cylindrical metallic masses 
of dimensions 1.12<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.25 inches (2.9<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.6 cm) in diameter and height shall be attached in good 
thermal contact with each temperature sensor within the refrigerated 
compartments. All temperature measuring sensor masses shall be supported 
by nonthermally conductive supports in such a manner that there will be 
at least one inch (2.5 cm) of air space separating the thermal mass from 
contact with any surface. In case of interference with hardware at the 
sensor locations specified in section 5.1, the sensors shall be placed 
at the nearest adjacent location such that there will be a one inch air 
space separating the sensor mass from the hardware.

[[Page 158]]

    2.4 Conditions for all-refrigerators. There shall be no load in the 
freezer compartment during the test.
    2.5 Steady State Condition. Steady state conditions exist if the 
temperature measurements in all measured compartments taken at four 
minute intervals or less during a stabilization period are not changing 
at a rate greater than 0.042 [deg]F. (0.023 [deg]C.) per hour as 
determined by the applicable condition of A or B.
    A. The average of the measurements during a two hour period if no 
cycling occurs or during a number of complete repetitive compressor 
cycles through a period of no less than two hours is compare to the 
average over an equivalent time period with three hours elapsed between 
the two measurement periods.
    B. If A above cannot be used, the average of the measurements during 
a number of complete repetitive compressor cycles through a period of no 
less than two hours and including the last complete cycle prior to a 
defrost period, or if no cycling occurs, the average of the measurements 
during the last two hours prior to a defrost period; are compared to the 
same averaging period prior to the following defrost period.
    2.6 Exterior air for externally vented refrigerator or refrigerator-
freezer. An exterior air source shall be provided with adjustable 
temperature and pressure capabilities. The exterior air temperature 
shall be adjustable from 35<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 [deg]F (1.7<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.6 [deg]C) to 90<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 [deg]F 
(32.2<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.6 [deg]C).
    2.6.1 Air duct. The exterior air shall pass from the exterior air 
source to the test unit through an insulated air duct.
    2.6.2 Air temperature measurement. The air temperature entering the 
condenser or condenser/compressor compartment shall be maintained to 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3 [deg]F (1.7 [deg]C) during the stabilization and 
test periods and shall be measured at the inlet point of the condenser 
or condenser/compressor compartment (``condenser inlet''). Temperature 
measurements shall be taken from at least three temperature sensors or 
one sensor per 4 square inches of the air duct cross sectional area, 
whichever is greater, and shall be averaged. For a unit that has a 
condenser air fan, a minimum of three temperature sensors at the 
condenser fan discharge shall be required. Temperature sensors shall be 
arranged to be at the centers of equally divided cross sectional areas. 
The exterior air temperature, at its source, shall be measured and 
maintained to <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 [deg]F (0.6 [deg]C) during the 
test period. The temperature measuring devices shall have an error not 
greater than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 [deg]F (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.3 
[deg]C). Measurements of the air temperature during the test period 
shall be taken at regular intervals not to exceed four minutes.
    2.6.3 Exterior air static pressure. The exterior air static pressure 
at the inlet point of the unit shall be adjusted to maintain a negative 
pressure of 0.20<gr-thn-eq><plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.05<gr-thn-eq> water 
column (62 Pa<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>12.5 Pa) for all air flow rates 
supplied to the unit. The pressure sensor shall be located on a straight 
duct with a distance of at least 7.5 times the diameter of the duct 
upstream and a distance of at least 3 times the diameter of the duct 
downstream. There shall be four static pressure taps at 90[deg]angles 
apart. The four pressures shall be averaged by interconnecting the four 
pressure taps. The air pressure measuring instrument shall have an error 
not greater than 0.01<gr-thn-eq> water column (2.5 Pa).

                        3. Test Control Settings

    3.1 Model with no user operable temperature control. A test shall be 
performed during which the compartment temperatures and energy use shall 
be measured. A second test shall be performed with the temperature 
control electrically short circuited to cause the compressor to run 
continuously.
    3.2 Model with user operable temperature control. Testing shall be 
performed in accordance with one of the following sections using the 
standardized temperatures of:

All-refrigerator: 38 [deg]F. (3.3 [deg]C.) fresh food compartment 
temperature
Refrigerator: 15 [deg]F. (-9.4 [deg]C.) freezer compartment temperature
Refrigerator-freezer: 5 [deg]F. (-15 [deg]C.) freezer compartment 
temperature
Variable defrost control models: 5 [deg]F (-15 [deg]C) freezer 
compartment temperature and 38 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 [deg]F fresh food 
compartment temperature during steady-state conditions with no door-
openings. If both settings cannot be obtained, then test with the fresh 
food compartment temperature at 38<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 [deg]F and the 
freezer compartment as close to 5 [deg]F as possible.

    3.2.1 A first test shall be performed with all compartment 
temperature controls set at their median position midway between their 
warmest and coldest settings. Knob detents shall be mechanically 
defeated if necessary to attain a median setting. A second test shall be 
performed with all controls set at either their warmest or their coldest 
setting (not electrically or mechanically bypassed), whichever is 
appropriate, to attempt to achieve compartment temperatures measured 
during the two tests which bound (i.e., one is above and one is below) 
the standardized temperature for the type of product being tested. If 
the compartment temperatures measured during these two tests bound the 
appropriate standardized temperature, then these test results shall be 
used to determine energy consumption. If the compartment temperature 
measured with all controls set at their coldest setting is above the 
standardized temperature, a third test shall be performed with all 
controls set at their warmest setting and the result of this test

[[Page 159]]

shall be used with the result of the test performed with all controls 
set at their coldest setting to determine energy consumption. If the 
compartment temperature measured with all controls set at their warmest 
setting is below the standardized temperature; and the fresh food 
compartment temperature is below 45 [deg]F. (7.22 [deg]C.) in the case 
of a refrigerator or a refrigerator-freezer, excluding an all-
refrigerator, then the result of this test alone will be used to 
determine energy consumption.
    3.2.2 Alternatively, a first test may be performed with all 
temperature controls set at their warmest setting. If the compartment 
temperature is below the appropriate standardized temperature, and the 
fresh food compartment temperature is below 45 [deg]F. (7.22 [deg]C.) in 
the case of a refrigerator or a refrigerator-freezer, excluding an all-
refrigerator, then the result of this test alone will be used to 
determine energy consumption. If the above conditions are not met, then 
the unit shall be tested in accordance with 3.2.1 above.
    3.2.3 Alternatively, a first test may be performed with all 
temperature controls set at their coldest setting. If the compartment 
temperature is above the appropriate standardized temperature, a second 
test shall be performed with all controls set at their warmest control 
setting and the results of these two tests shall be used to determine 
energy consumption. If the above condition is not met, then the unit 
shall be tested in accordance with 3.2.1 above.
    3.3 Variable defrost control optional test. After a steady-state 
condition is achieved, the optional test requires door-openings for 
12<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 seconds every 60 minutes on the fresh food 
compartment door and a simultaneous 12<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 second 
freezer compartment door-opening occurring every 4th time, to obtain 24 
fresh food and six freezer compartment door-openings per 24-hour period. 
The first freezer door-opening shall be simultaneous with the fourth 
fresh food door-opening. The doors are to be opened 60[deg] to 
90[deg]with an average velocity for the leading edge of the door of 
approximately 2 ft./sec. Prior to the initiation of the door-opening 
sequence, the refrigerator defrost control mechanism may be re-initiated 
in order to minimize the test duration.

                             4. Test Period

    4.1 Test Period. Tests shall be performed by establishing the 
conditions set forth in Section 2, and using control settings as set 
forth in Section 3, above.
    4.1.1 Nonautomatic Defrost. If the model being tested has no 
automatic defrost system, the test time period shall start after steady 
state conditions have been achieved and be of not less than three hours 
in duration. During the test period, the compressor motor shall complete 
two or more whole compressor cycles (a compressor cycle is a complete 
``on'' and a complete ``off'' period of the motor). If no ``off'' 
cycling will occur, as determined during the stabilization period, the 
test period shall be three hours. If incomplete cycling (less than two 
compressor cycles) occurs during a 24 hour period, the results of the 24 
hour period shall be used.
    4.1.2 Automatic Defrost. If the model being tested has an automatic 
defrost system, the test time period shall start after steady state 
conditions have been achieved and be from one point during a defrost 
period to the same point during the next defrost period. If the model 
being tested has a long-time automatic defrost system, the alternative 
provisions of 4.1.2.1 may be used. If the model being tested has a 
variable defrost control, the provisions of section 4.1.2.2 or 4.1.2.3 
shall apply. If the model has a dual compressor system the provisions of 
4.1.2.4 shall apply.
    4.1.2.1 Long-time Automatic Defrost. If the model being tested has a 
long-time automatic defrost system, the test time period may consist of 
two parts. A first part would be the same as the test for a unit having 
no defrost provisions (section 4.1.1). The second part would start when 
a defrost is initiated when the compressor ``on'' cycle is terminated 
prior to start of the defrost heater and terminates at the second turn 
``on'' of the compressor or four hours from the initiation of the 
defrost heater, whichever comes first. See diagram in Figure 1 to this 
section.

[[Page 160]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07MR03.019

    4.1.2.2 Variable defrost control. If the model being tested has a 
variable defrost control system, the test shall consist of three parts. 
Two parts shall be the same as the test for long-time automatic defrost 
(section 4.1.2.1). The third part is the optional test to determine the 
time between defrosts (section 5.2.1.3). The third part is used by 
manufacturers that choose not to accept the default value of F of 0.20, 
to calculate CT.
    4.1.2.3 Variable defrost control optional test. After steady-state 
conditions with no door openings are achieved in accordance with section 
3.3 above, the test is continued using the above daily door-opening 
sequence until stabilized operation is achieved. Stabilization is 
defined as a minimum of three consecutive defrost cycles with times 
between defrosts that will allow the calculation of a Mean Time Between 
Defrosts (MTBD1) that satisfies the statistical relationship of 90 
percent confidence. The test is repeated on at least one more unit of 
the model and until the Mean Time Between Defrosts for the multiple unit 
tests (MTBD2) satisfies the statistical relationship. If the time 
between defrosts is greater than 96 hours (compressor ``on'' time) and 
this defrost period can be repeated on a second unit, the test may be 
terminated at 96 hours (CT) and the absolute time value used for MTBD 
for each unit.
    4.1.2.4 Dual compressor systems with automatic defrost. If the model 
being tested has separate compressor systems for the refrigerator and 
freezer sections, each with its own automatic defrost system, then the 
two-part method in 4.1.2.1 shall be used. The second part of the method 
will be conducted separately for each automatic defrost system. The 
auxiliary components (fan motors, anti-sweat heaters, etc.) will be 
identified for

[[Page 161]]

each system and the energy consumption measured during each test.

                          5. Test Measurements

    5.1 Temperature Measurements. Temperature measurements shall be made 
at the locations prescribed in Figures 7.1 and 7.2 of HRF-1-1979 and 
shall be accurate to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 [deg]F. (0.3 
[deg]C.) of true value. No freezer temperature measurements need be 
taken in an all-refrigerator model.
    If the interior arrangements of the cabinet do not conform with 
those shown in Figure 7.1 and 7.2 of HRF-1-1979, measurements shall be 
taken at selected locations chosen to represent approximately the entire 
refrigerated compartment. The locations selected shall be a matter of 
record.
    5.1.1 Measured Temperature. The measured temperature of a 
compartment is to be the average of all sensor temperature readings 
taken in that compartment at a particular time. Measurements shall be 
taken at regular intervals not to exceed four minutes.
    5.1.2 Compartment Temperature. The compartment temperature for each 
test period shall be an average of the measured temperatures taken in a 
compartment during a complete cycle or several complete cycles of the 
compressor motor (one compressor cycle is one complete motor ``on'' and 
one complete motor ``off'' period). For long-time automatic defrost 
models, compartment temperatures shall be those measured in the first 
part of the test period specified in 4.1.1. For models equipped with 
variable defrost controls, compartment temperatures shall be those 
measured in the first part of the test period specified in 4.1.2.2 
above.
    5.1.2.1 The number of complete compressor motor cycles over which 
the measured temperatures in a compartment are to be averaged to 
determine compartment temperature shall be equal to the number of 
minutes between measured temperature readings, rounded up to the next 
whole minute or a number of complete cycles over a time period exceeding 
one hour. One of the cycles shall be the last complete compressor motor 
cycle during the test period.
    5.1.2.2 If no compressor motor cycling occurs, the compartment 
temperature shall be the average of the measured temperatures taken 
during the last thirty-two minutes of the test period.
    5.1.2.3 If incomplete cycling occurs, the compartment temperatures 
shall be the average of the measured temperatures taken during the last 
three hours of the last complete ``on'' period.
    5.2 Energy Measurements
    5.2.1 Per-day Energy Consumption. The energy consumption in 
kilowatt-hours per day for each test period shall be the energy expended 
during the test period as specified in section 4.1 adjusted to a 24 hour 
period. The adjustment shall be determined as follows:
    5.2.1.1 Nonautomatic and automatic defrost models. The energy 
consumption in kilowatt-hours per day shall be calculated equivalent to:

ET=EPx1440/T

where

ET=test cycle energy expended in kilowatt-hours per day,
EP=energy expended in kilowatt-hours during the test period,
T=length of time of the test period in minutes, and
1440=conversion factor to adjust to a 24 hour period in minutes per day.

    5.2.1.2 Long-time Automatic Defrost. If the two part test method is 
used, the energy consumption in kilowatt-hours per day shall be 
calculated equivalent to:

ET=(1440xEP1/T1)+((EP2-(EP1xT2/T1))x12/CT)

where

ET and 1440 are defined in 5.2.1.1,
EP1=energy expended in kilowatt-hours during the first part of the test,
EP2=energy expended in kilowatt-hours during the second part of the 
test,
T1 and T2=length of time in minutes of the first and second test parts 
respectively,
CT=Defrost timer run time in hours required to cause it to go through a 
complete cycle, to the nearest tenth hour per cycle, and
12=factor to adjust for a 50% run time of the compressor in hours per 
day.

    5.2.1.3 Variable defrost control. The energy consumption in 
kilowatt-hours per day shall be calculated equivalent to:

ET=(1440xEP1/T1)+(EP2-(EP1xT2/T1))x(12/CT) where 1440 is defined in 
5.2.1.1 and EP1, EP2, T1, T2 and 12 are defined in 5.2.1.2.

CT=CT<INF>L</INF>xCT<INF>M</INF>)/(Fx(CT<INF>M</INF>-
CT<INF>L</INF>)+CT<INF>L</INF>)

CT<INF>L</INF>=least or shortest time between defrosts in tenths of an 
hour (greater than or equal to six but less than or equal to 12 hours)
CT<INF>M</INF>=maximum time between defrost cycles in tenths of an hour 
(greater than CT<INF>L</INF> but not more than 96 hours)
F=ratio of per day energy consumption in excess of the least energy and 
the maximum difference in per day energy consumption and is equal to
F = (1/CT - 1/CT<INF>M</INF>)/(1/CT<INF>L</INF> - 1/CT<INF>M</INF> = 
(ET-ET<INF>L</INF>)/ET<INF>M</INF> - ET<INF>L</INF>) or 0.20 in lieu of 
testing to find CT.
ET<INF>L</INF> = least electrical energy used (kilowatt hours)
ET<INF>M</INF>=maximum electrical energy used (kilowatt hours). For 
demand defrost models with no values for CT<INF>L</INF> and 
CT<INF>M</INF> in the algorithm the default values of 12 and 84 shall be 
used, respectively.

    5.2.1.5 Dual compressor systems with dual automatic defrost. The 
two-part test method in section 4.1.2.2 must be used, the energy 
consumption in kilowatt per day shall be calculated equivalent to:

ET=(1440 x EP1/T1) + (EP2<INF>F</INF> - (EP<INF>F</INF> x T2/T1)) x 12/
CT<INF>F</INF> + (EP2<INF>R</INF> - (EP<INF>R</INF> x T3/T1)) x 12/
CT<INF>R</INF>

Where 1440, EP1, T1, EP2, 12, and CT are defined in 5.2.1.2
EP<INF>F</INF> = energy expended in kilowatt-hours during the second 
part of the test for the freezer system by the freezer system.
EP2<INF>F</INF> = total energy expended during the second part of the 
test for the freezer system.
EP<INF>R</INF> = energy expended in kilowatt-hours during the second 
part of the test for the refrigerator system by the refrigerator system.
EP2<INF>R</INF> = total energy expended during the second part of the 
test for the refrigerator system.

(tenths of an hour).

    5.3 Volume measurements. The electric refrigerator or electric 
refrigerator-freezer total refrigerated volume, VT, shall be measured in 
accordance with HRF-1-1979, section 3.20 and sections 4.2 through 4.3 
and be calculated equivalent to:

VT=VF+VFF

where

VT=total refrigerated volume in cubic feet,
VF=freezer compartment volume in cubic feet, and

All test measurements for the externally vented refrigerator or 
refrigerator-freezer shall be made in accordance with the requirements 
of other sections of this appendix, except as modified in this section 
5.4 or other sections expressly applicable to externally vented 
refrigerators or refrigerator-freezers.
    5.4.1 Operability of thermostatic and mixing of air controls. Prior 
to conducting energy consumption tests, the operability of thermostatic 
controls that permit the mixing of exterior and ambient air when 
exterior air temperatures are less than 60 [deg]F must be verified. The 
operability of such controls shall be verified by operating the unit 
under ambient air temperature of 90 [deg]F and exterior air temperature 
of 45 [deg]F. If the inlet air entering the condenser or condenser/
compressor compartment is maintained at 60 [deg]F, plus or minus three 
degrees, energy consumption of the unit shall be measured under 5.4.2.2 
and 5.4.2.3. If the inlet air entering the condenser or condenser/
compressor compartment is not maintained at 60 [deg]F, plus or minus 
three degrees, energy consumption of the unit shall also be measured 
under 5.4.2.4.
    5.4.2 Energy consumption tests.
    5.4.2.1 Correction factor test. To enable calculation of a 
correction factor, K, two full cycle tests shall be conducted to measure 
energy consumption of the unit with air mixing controls disabled and the 
condenser inlet air temperatures set at 90 [deg]F (32.2 [deg]C) and 80 
[deg]F (26.7 [deg]C). Both tests shall be conducted with all compartment 
temperature controls set at the position midway between their warmest 
and coldest settings and the anti-sweat heater switch off. Record the 
energy consumptions ec<INF>90</INF> and ec<INF>80</INF>, in kWh/day.
    5.4.2.2 Energy consumption at 90 [deg]F. The unit shall be tested at 
90 [deg]F (32.2 [deg]C) exterior air temperature to record the energy 
consumptions (e<INF>90</INF>)<INF>i</INF> in kWh/day. For a given 
setting of the anti-sweat heater, i corresponds to each of the two 
states of the compartment temperature control positions.
    5.4.2.3 Energy consumption at 60 [deg]F. The unit shall be tested at 
60 [deg]F (26.7 [deg]C) exterior air temperature to record the energy 
consumptions (e<INF>60</INF>)<INF>i</INF> in kWh/day. For a given 
setting of the anti-sweat heater, i corresponds to each of the two 
states of the compartment temperature control positions.
    5.4.2.4 Energy consumption if mixing controls do not operate 
properly. If the operability of temperature and mixing controls has not 
been verified as required under 5.4.1, the unit shall be tested at 50 
[deg]F (10.0 [deg]C) and 30 [deg]F (-1.1 [deg]C) exterior air 
temperatures to record the energy consumptions 
(e<INF>50</INF>)<INF>i</INF> and (e<INF>30</INF>)<INF>i</INF>. For a 
given setting of the anti-sweat heater, i corresponds to each of the two 
states of the compartment temperature control positions.

the nearest one hundredth (0.01) kilowatt-hour and shall depend upon the 
temperature attainable in the fresh food compartment as shown below.
    6.2.1.1 If the fresh food compartment temperature is always below

energy consumption for a cycle type is expressed in kilowatt-hours per-
cycle to the nearest one hundredth (0.01) kilowatt-hour and shall be 
defined in the applicable following manner.
    6.2.2.1 If the fresh food compartment temperature is always at or 
below 45 [deg]F. (7.2 [deg]C.) in both of the tests and the freezer 
compartment temperature is always at or below 15 [deg]F. (-9.4 [deg]C.) 
in both tests of a refrigerator or at or below 5 [deg]F. (-15 [deg]C.)

compartment temperature was measured.
    6.2.2.2 If the conditions of 6.2.2.1 do not exist, the per-cycle 
energy consumption shall be defined by the higher of the two values 
calculated by the following two formulas:

E=ET1+((ET2-ET1)x(45.0-TR1)/(TR2-TR1))

cycle energy consumption measurements for the externally vented 
refrigerator or refrigerator-freezer shall be calculated in accordance 
with the requirements of this Appendix, as modified in sections 6.3.1-
6.3.7.
    6.3.1 Correction factor. A correction factor, K, shall be calculated 
as:

K = ec<INF>90</INF>/ec<INF>80</INF>

where ec<INF>90</INF> and ec<INF>80</INF> = the energy consumption test 
results as determined under 5.4.2.1.

    6.3.2 Combining test results of different settings of compartment 
temperature controls. For a given setting of the anti-sweat heater, 
follow the calculation procedures of 6.2 to combine the test results for 
energy consumption of the unit at different temperature control settings 
for each condenser inlet air temperature tested under 5.4.2.2, 5.4.2.3, 
and 5.4.2.4, where applicable, (e<INF>90</INF>)<INF>i</INF>, 
(e<INF>60</INF>)<INF>i</INF>, (e<INF>50</INF>)<INF>i</INF>, and 
(e<INF>30</INF>)<INF>i</INF>. The combined values are 
[egr]<INF>90</INF>, [egr]<INF>60</INF>, [egr]<INF>50</INF>, and 
[egr]<INF>30</INF>, where applicable, in kWh/day.
    6.3.3 Energy consumption corrections. For a given setting of the 
anti-sweat heater, the energy consumptions [egr]<INF>90</INF>, 
[egr]<INF>60</INF>, [egr]<INF>50</INF>, and [egr]<INF>30</INF> 
calculated in 6.3.2 shall be adjusted by multiplying the correction 
factor K to obtain the

[[Page 164]]

corrected energy consumptions per day, in kWh/day:

E<INF>90</INF> = K x [egr]<INF>90</INF>,
E<INF>60</INF> = K x [egr]<INF>60</INF>
E<INF>50</INF> = K x [egr]<INF>50</INF>, and
E<INF>30</INF> = K x [egr]<INF>30</INF>

where,

K is determined under section 6.3.1, and [egr]<INF>90</INF>, 
[egr]<INF>60</INF>, [egr]<INF>50</INF>, and [egr]<INF>30</INF> are 
determined under section 6.3.2.

    6.3.4 Energy profile equation. For a given setting of the anti-sweat 
heater, the energy consumption E<INF>X</INF>, in kWh/day, at a specific 
exterior air temperature between 80 [deg]F (26.7 [deg]C) and 60 [deg]F 
(26.7 [deg]C) shall be calculated by the following equation:

E<INF>X</INF> = a + bT<INF>X</INF>,

where,

T<INF>X</INF> = exterior air temperature in [deg]F;
a = 3E<INF>60</INF>-2E<INF>90</INF>, in kWh/day;
b = (E<INF>90</INF>-E<INF>60</INF>)/30, in kWh/day per [deg]F.

    6.3.5 Energy consumption at 80 [deg]F (26.7 [deg]C), 75 [deg]F (23.9 
[deg]C) and 65 [deg]F (18.3 [deg]C). For a given setting of the anti-
sweat heater, calculate the energy consumptions at 80 [deg]F (26.7 
[deg]C), 75 [deg]F (23.9 [deg]C) and 65 [deg]F (18.3 [deg]C) exterior 
air temperatures, E<INF>80</INF>, E<INF>75</INF> and E<INF>65</INF>, 
respectively, in kWh/day, using the equation in 6.3.4.
    6.3.6 National average per cycle energy consumption. For a given 
setting of the anti-sweat heater, calculate the national average energy 
consumption, E<INF>N</INF>, in kWh/day, using one of the following 
equations:

E<INF>N</INF> = 0.523 x E<INF>60</INF> + 0.165 x E<INF>65</INF> + 0.181 
x E<INF>75</INF> + 0.131 x E<INF>80</INF>, for units not tested under 
5.4.2.4,

E<INF>N</INF> = 0.257 x E<INF>30</INF> + 0.266 x E<INF>50</INF> + 0.165 
x E<INF>65</INF> + 0.181 x E<INF>75</INF> + 0.131 x E<INF>80</INF>, for

E<INF>65</INF>, E<INF>75</INF>, and E<INF>80</INF> are defined in 6.3.5, 
and
the coefficients are weather associated weighting factors.

    6.3.7 Regional average per cycle energy consumption. If regional 
average per cycle energy consumption is required to be calculated, for a 
given setting of the anti-sweat heater, calculate the regional average 
per cycle energy consumption, E<INF>R</INF>, in kWh/day, for the regions 
in figure 1 using one of the following equations and the coefficients in 
the table A:

E<INF>R</INF> = a<INF>1</INF> x E<INF>60</INF> + c x E<INF>65</INF> + d 
x E<INF>75</INF> + e x E<INF>80</INF>, for a unit that is not required 
to be tested under 5.4.2.4,

E<INF>R</INF> = a x E<INF>30</INF> + b x E<INF>50</INF> + c x 
E<INF>65</INF> + d x E<INF>75</INF> + e x E<INF>80</INF>, for a unit

   Sec. Appendix B1 to Subpart B of Part 430--Uniform Test Method for 
              Measuring the Energy Consumption of Freezers

                             1. Definitions.

    1.1 ``HRF-1-1979'' means the Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers standard for household refrigerators, combination 
refrigerators-freezers, and household freezers, also approved as an 
American National Standard as a revision of ANSI B38.1-1970.
    1.2 ``Anti-sweat heater'' means a device incorporated into the 
design of a freezer to prevent the accumulation of moisture on exterior 
surfaces of the cabinet under conditions of high ambient humidity.
    1.3 ``Cycle'' means the period of 24 hours for which the energy use 
of a freezer is calculated as though the consumer-activated compartment 
temperature controls were preset so that the desired compartment 
temperatures were maintained.
    1.4 ``Cycle type'' means the set of test conditions having the 
calculated effect of operating a freezer for a period of 24 hours with 
the consumer-activated controls other than the compartment temperature 
control set to establish various operating characteristics.
    1.5 ``Standard cycle'' means the cycle type in which the anti-sweat 
heater switch, when provided, is set in the highest energy consuming 
position.
    1.6 ``Adjusted total volume'' means the product of, (1) the freezer 
volume as defined in HRF-1-1979 in cubic feet, times (2) an adjustment 
factor.
    1.7 ``Automatic Defrost'' means a system in which the defrost cycle 
is automatically initiated and terminated, with resumption of normal 
refrigeration at the conclusion of defrost operation. The system 
automatically prevents the permanent formation of frost on all 
refrigerated surfaces. Nominal refrigerated food temperatures are 
maintained during the operation of the automatic defrost system.
    1.8 ``Long-time Automatic Defrost'' means an automatic defrost 
system where successive defrost cycles are separated by 14 hours or more 
of compressor-operating time.
    1.9 ``Stabilization Period'' means the total period of time during 
which steady-state conditions are being attained or evaluated.
    1.10 ``Variable defrost control'' means a long-time automatic 
defrost system (except the 14-hour defrost qualification does not

[[Page 166]]

apply) where successive defrost cycles are determined by an operating 
condition variable or variables other than solely compressor operating 
time. This includes any electrical or mechanical device. Demand defrost 
is a type of variable defrost control.
    1.11 ``Quick freeze'' means an optional feature on freezers which is 
initiated manually and shut off manually. It bypasses the thermostat 
control and places the compressor in a steady-state operating condition 
until it is shut off.

                           2. Test Conditions.

    2.1 Ambient temperature. The ambient temperature shall be 90.0<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>1.0 [deg]F. (32.2<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.6 [deg]C.) 
during the stabilization period and during the test period. The ambient 
temperature shall be 80<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 [deg]F dry bulb and 67 
[deg]F wet bulb during the stabilization period and during the test 
period when the unit is tested in accordance with section 3.3.
    2.2 Operational conditions. The freezer shall be installed and its 
operating conditions maintained in accordance with HRF-1-1979, section 
7.2 through section 7.4.3.3, except that the vertical ambient gradient 
at locations 10 inches (25.4 cm) out from the centers of the two sides 
of the unit being tested is to be maintained during the test. Unless the 
area is obstructed by shields or baffles, the gradient is to be 
maintained from 2 inches (5.1 cm) above the floor or supporting platform 
to a height one foot (30.5 cm) above the unit under test. Defrost 
controls are to be operative and the anti-sweat heater switch is to be 
``on'' during one test and ``off'' during a second test. The quick 
freeze option shall be switched off unless specified.
    2.3 Steady State Condition. Steady state conditions exist if the 
temperature measurements taken at four minute intervals or less during a 
stabilization period are not changing at a rate greater than 0.042 
[deg]F. (0.023 [deg]C.) per hour as determined by the applicable 
condition of A or B.
A--The average of the measurements during a two hour period if no 
cycling occurs or during a number of complete repetitive compressor 
cycles through a period of no less than two hours is compared to the 
average over an equivalent time period with three hours elapsed between 
the two measurement periods.
B--If A above cannot be used, the average of the measurements during a 
number of complete repetitive compressor cycles through a period of no 
less than two hours and including the last complete cycle prior to a 
defrost period, or if no cycling occurs, the average of the measurements 
during the last two hours prior to a defrost period; are compared to the 
same averaging period prior to the following defrost period.

                        3. Test Control Settings.

    3.1 Model with no user operable temperature control. A test shall be 
performed during which the compartment temperature and energy use shall 
be measured. A second test shall be performed with the temperature 
control electrically short circuited to cause the compressor to run 
continuously. If the model has the quick freeze option, it is to be used 
to bypass the temperature control.
    3.2 Model with user operable temperature control. Testing shall be 
performed in accordance with one of the following sections using the 
standardized temperature of 0.0 [deg]F. (-17.8 [deg]C.). Variable 
defrost control models shall achieve 0<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 [deg]F 
during the steady-state conditions prior to the optional test with no 
door openings.
    3.2.1 A first test shall be performed with all temperature controls 
set at their median position midway between their warmest and coldest 
settings. Knob detents shall be mechanically defeated if necessary to 
attain a median setting. A second test shall be performed with all 
controls set at either their warmest or their coldest setting (not 
electrically or mechanically bypassed), whichever is appropriate, to 
attempt to achieve compartment temperatures measured during the two 
tests which bound (i.e., one is above and one is below) the standardized 
temperature. If the compartment temperatures measured during these two 
tests bound the standardized temperature, then these test results shall 
be used to determine energy consumption. If the compartment temperature 
measured with all controls set at their coldest setting is above the 
standardized temperature, a third test shall be performed with all 
controls set at their warmest setting and the result of this test shall 
be used with the result of the test performed with all controls set at 
their coldest setting to determine energy consumption. If the 
compartment temperature measured with all controls set at their warmest 
setting is below the standardized temperature; then the result of this 
test alone will be used to determine energy consumption.
    3.2.2 Alternatively, a first test may be performed with all 
temperature controls set at their warmest setting. If the compartment 
temperature is below the standardized temperature, then the result of 
this test alone will be used to determine energy consumption. If the 
above condition is not met, then the unit shall be tested in accordance 
with 3.2.1 above.
    3.2.3 Alternatively, a first test may be performed with all 
temperature controls set at their coldest setting. If the compartment 
temperature is above the standardized temperature, a second test shall 
be performed with all controls set at their warmest setting and the 
results of these two tests shall be used to determine energy 
consumption. If

[[Page 167]]

the above condition is not met, then the unit shall be tested in 
accordance with 3.2.1 above.
    3.3 Variable defrost control optional test. After a steady-state 
condition is achieved, the door-opening sequence is initiated with an 
18<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 second freezer door-opening occurring every 
eight hours to obtain three door-openings per 24-hour period. The first 
freezer door-opening shall occur at the initiation of the test period. 
The door(s) are to be opened 60 to 90[deg]with an average velocity for 
the leading edge of the door of approximately two feet per second. Prior 
to the initiation of the door-opening sequence, the freezer defrost 
control mechanism may be re-initiated in order to minimize the test 
duration.

                             4. Test Period.

    4.1 Test Period. Tests shall be performed by establishing the 
conditions set forth in Section 2 and using control settings as set 
forth in Section 3 above.
    4.1.1 Nonautomatic Defrost. If the model being tested has no 
automatic defrost system, the test time period shall start after steady 
state conditions have been achieved, and be of not less than three 
hours' duration. During the test period the compressor motor shall 
complete two or more whole cycles (a compressor cycle is a complete 
``on'' and a complete ``off'' period of the motor). If no ``off'' 
cycling will occur, as determined during the stabilization period, the 
test period shall be three hours. If incomplete cycling (less than two 
compressor cycles) occurs during a 24 hour period, the results of the 24 
hour period shall be used.
    4.1.2 Automatic Defrost. If the model being tested has an automatic 
defrost system, the test time period shall start after steady state 
conditions have been achieved and be from one point during a defrost 
period to the same point during the next defrost period. If the model 
being tested has a long-time automatic defrost system, the alternate 
provisions of 4.1.2.1 may be used. If the model being tested has a 
variable defrost control the provisions of 4.1.2.2. shall apply.
    4.1.2.1 Long-time Automatic Defrost. If the model being tested has a 
long-time automatic defrost system, the test time period may consist of 
two parts. A first part would be the same as the test for a unit having 
no defrost provisions (section 4.1.1). The second part would start when 
a defrost period is initiated during a compressor ``on'' cycle and 
terminate at the second turn ``on'' of the compressor motor or after 
four hours, whichever comes first.
    4.1.2.2 Variable defrost control. If the model being tested has a 
variable defrost control system, the test shall consist of three parts. 
Two parts shall be the same as the test for long-time automatic defrost 
in accordance with section 4.1.2.1 above. The third part is the optional 
test to determine the time between defrosts (5.2.1.3). The third part is 
used by manufacturers that choose not to accept the default value of F 
of 0.20, to calculate CT.
    4.1.2.3 Variable defrost control optional test. After steady-state 
conditions with no door-openings are achieved in accordance with section 
3.3 above, the test is continued using the above daily door-opening 
sequence until stabilized operation is achieved. Stabilization is 
defined as a minimum of three consecutive defrost cycles with times 
between defrost that will allow the calculation of a Mean Time Between 
Defrosts (MTBD1) that satisfies the statistical relationship of 90 
percent confidence. The test is repeated on at least one more unit of 
the model and until the Mean Time Between Defrosts for the multiple unit 
test (MTBD2) satisfies the statistical relationship. If the time between 
defrosts is greater than 96 hours (compressor ``on'' time) and this 
defrost period can be repeated on a second unit, the test may be 
terminated at 96 hours (CT) and the absolute time value used for MTBD 
for each unit.

                          5. Test Measurements.

    5.1 Temperature Measurements. Temperature measurements shall be made 
at the locations prescribed in Figure 7-2 of HRF-1-1979 and shall be 
accurate to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 [deg]F. (0.3 [deg]C.) of 
true value.
    5.1.1 Measured Temperature. The measured temperature is to be the 
average of all sensor temperature readings taken at a particular time. 
Measurements shall be taken at regular intervals not to exceed four 
minutes.
    5.1.2 Compartment Temperature. The compartment temperature for each 
test period shall be an average of the measured temperatures taken 
during a complete cycle or several complete cycles of the compressor 
motor (one compressor cycle is one complete motor ``on'' and one 
complete motor ``off'' period). For long-time automatic defrost models, 
compartment temperature shall be that measured in the first part of the 
test period specified in 4.1.1. For models equipped with variable 
defrost controls, compartment temperatures shall be those measured in 
the first part of the test period specified in 4.1.2.2.
    5.1.2.1 The number of complete compressor motor cycles over which 
the measured temperatures in a compartment are to be averaged to 
determine compartment temperature shall be equal to the number of 
minutes between measured temperature readings rounded up to the next 
whole minute or a number of complete cycles over a time period exceeding 
one hour. One of the cycles shall be the last complete compressor motor 
cycles during the test period.
    5.1.2.2 If no compressor motor cycling occurs, the compartment 
temperature shall be the average of the measured temperatures

[[Page 168]]

taken during the last thirty-two minutes of the test period.

kilowatt-hours per day shall be calculated equivalent to:

ET=(1440 x EP1/T1) + (EP2 - (EP1 x T2/T1) x (12/CT) where 1440 is 
defined in 5.2.1.1 and EP1, EP2, T1, T2 and 12 are defined in 5.2.1.2.

CT=(CT<INF>L</INF> x CT<INF>M</INF>)/(Fx (CT<INF>M</INF> - 
CT<INF>L</INF>) + CT<INF>L</INF>)

where:

CT<INF>L</INF>=least or shortest time between defrost in tenths of an

dishwasher to the cycle type to be tested, initiating the cycle, and 
allowing the cycle to proceed to completion.
    4.2 Machine electrical energy consumption. Measure the machine 
electrical energy consumption, M, expressed as the number of kilowatt-
hours of electricity consumed by the machine during the entire test 
cycle, using a water supply temperature as set forth in section 2.3 of 
this Appendix and using a watt-hour meter as specified in section 3.5 of 
this Appendix.
    4.3 Water consumption. Measure the water consumption, V, expressed 
as the number of gallons of water delivered to the machine during the 
entire test cycle, using a water meter as specified in section 3.3 of 
this Appendix.
    4.4 Standby power. Connect the dishwasher to a standby wattmeter or 
a standby watt-hour meter as specified in sections 3.6 and 3.7, 
respectively, of this Appendix. Select the conditions necessary to 
achieve operation in the standby mode as defined in section 1.14 of this 
Appendix. Monitor the power consumption but allow the dishwasher to 
stabilize for at least 5 minutes. Then monitor the power consumption for 
at least an additional 5 minutes. If the power level does not change by 
more than 5 percent from the maximum observed value during the later 5 
minutes and there is no cyclic or pulsing behavior of the load, the load 
can be considered stable. For stable operation, standby power, 
S<INF>m</INF>, can be recorded directly from the standby watt meter in 
watts or accumulated using the standby watt-hour meter over a period of 
at least 5 minutes. For unstable operation, the energy must be 
accumulated using the standby watt-hour meter over a period of at least 
5 minutes and must capture the energy use over one or more complete 
cycles. Calculate the average standby power, S<INF>m</INF>, expressed in 
watts by dividing the accumulated energy consumption by the duration of 
the measurement period.

all corners and depressions are filled and that there are no extrusions 
of the plastic bag through the opening in the drum. Support the dryer's 
rear drum surface on a platform scale to prevent deflection of the 
dryer, and record the weight of the empty dryer. Fill the drum with 
water to a level determined by the intersection of the door plane and 
the loading port. Record the temperature of the water and then the 
weight of the dryer with the added water and then determine the mass of 
the water in pounds. Add or subtract the appropriate volume depending on 
whether or not the plastic bag protrudes into the drum interior. The 
drum capacity is calculated as follows:

C=w/d

setting and, if equipped with a timer, at the maximum time setting and 
dry the test load until the moisture content of the test load is between 
2.5 percent to 5.0 percent of the bone-dry weight of the test load, but 
do not permit the dryer to advance into cool down. If required, reset 
the timer or automatic dry control.

and 2.3.2.2, to standard pressure and temperature conditions in 
accordance with U.S. Bureau of Standards, circular C417, 1938. A sample 
calculation is illustrated in Appendix E of HLD-1.

    1.1 Cut-in means the time when or water temperature at which a water 
heater control or thermostat acts to increase the energy or fuel input 
to the heating elements, compressor, or burner.
    1.2 Cut-out means the time when or water temperature at which a 
water heater control or thermostat acts to reduce to a minimum the 
energy or fuel input to the heating elements, compressor, or burner.
    1.3 Design Power Rating means the nominal power rating that a water 
heater manufacturer assigns to a particular design of water heater, 
expressed in kilowatts or Btu (kJ) per hour as appropriate.
    1.4 Energy Factor means a measure of water heater overall 
efficiency.
    1.5 First-Hour Rating means an estimate of the maximum volume of 
``hot'' water that a storage-type water heater can supply within an hour

thermostats satisfied). It is a function of both the storage volume and 
the recovery rate.
    1.6 Heat Trap means a device which can be integrally connected or 
independently attached to the hot and/or cold water pipe connections of 
a water heater such that the device will develop a thermal or mechanical 
seal to minimize the recirculation of water due to thermal convection 
between the water heater tank and its connecting pipes.

is designed to deliver water at a controlled temperature of less than 
180 [deg]F (82 [deg]C), has an input greater than 50,000 Btu/h (53 MJ/h) 
but less than 200,000 Btu/h (210 MJ/h), and has a manufacturer's 
specified storage capacity of less than 2 gallons (7.6 liters). The unit 
may use a fixed or variable burner input.

heater and the platform. Counter-top water heaters shall be placed 
against a simulated wall section. Wall-mounted water heaters shall be 
supported on a simulated wall in accordance

[[Page 181]]

with the manufacturer-published installation instructions. When a 
simulated wall is used, the recommended construction is 2 x 4 inch (5 cm 
x 10 cm) studs, faced with \3/4\ inch (2 cm) plywood. For heat pump 
water heaters that are supplied with a storage tank, the two components, 
if not delivered as a single package, shall be connected in accordance 
with the manufacturer-published installation instructions and the 
overall system shall be placed on the above-described plywood platform. 
If installation instructions are not provided by the heat pump 
manufacturer, uninsulated 8 foot (2.4 m) long connecting hoses having an 
inside diameter of \5/8\ inch (1.6 cm) shall be used to connect the 
storage tank and the heat pump water heater. With the exception of using 
the storage tank described in 4.10, the same requirements shall apply 
for heat pump water heaters that are supplied without a storage tank 
from the manufacturer. The testing of the water heater shall occur in an 
area that is protected from drafts.
    4.2 Water Supply. Connect the water heater to a water supply capable 
of delivering water at conditions as specified in Sections 2.3 and 2.5

piping connections shall be configured in a manner consistent with 
Figures 1 and 2. Inlet and outlet piping connections for wall-mounted 
water heaters shall be consistent with Figure 3. For freestanding water 
heaters that are 36 inches or less in height and not supplied as part of 
a counter-top enclosure (commonly referred to as an under-the-counter 
model), inlet and outlet piping shall be installed in a manner 
consistent with Figures 4, 5, and 6. For water heaters that are supplied 
with a counter-top enclosure, inlet and outlet piping shall be made in a 
manner consistent with Figures 7A and 7B, respectively. The vertical 
piping noted in Figures 7A and 7B shall be located (whether inside the 
enclosure or along the outside in a recessed channel) in accordance with 
the manufacturer-published installation instructions.
    All dimensions noted in Figures 1 through 7 shall be achieved. All 
piping between the water heater and the inlet and outlet temperature 
sensors, noted as T<INF>IN</INF> and T<INF>OUT</INF> in the figures, 
shall be Type ``L'' hard copper having the same diameter as the 
connections on the water heater. Unions may be used to facilitate 
installation and removal of the piping arrangements. A pressure gauge 
and diaphragm expansion tank shall be installed in the supply water 
piping at a location upstream of the inlet temperature sensor. An 
appropriately rated pressure and temperature relief valve shall be 
installed on all water heaters at the port specified by the 
manufacturer. Discharge piping for the relief valve shall be non-
metallic. If heat traps, piping insulation, or pressure relief valve 
insulation are supplied with the water heater, they shall be installed 
for testing. Except when using a simulated wall, clearance shall be 
provided such that none of the piping contacts other surfaces in the 
test room.

    4.4 Fuel and/or Electrical Power and Energy Consumption. Install one 
or more instruments which measure, as appropriate, the quantity and rate 
of electrical energy and/or fossil fuel consumption in accordance with 
Section 3. For heat pump water heaters that use supplemental resistive 
heating, the electrical energy supplied to the resistive element(s) 
shall be metered separately from the electrical energy supplied to the 
entire appliance or to the remaining components (e.g., compressor, fans, 
pumps, controls).
    4.5 Internal Storage Tank Temperature Measurements. Install six 
temperature measurement sensors inside the water heater tank with a 
vertical distance of at least 4 inches (100 mm) between successive 
sensors. A temperature sensor shall be positioned at the vertical 
midpoint of each of the six equal

[[Page 186]]

volume nodes within the tank. Nodes designate the equal volumes used to 
evenly partition the total volume of the tank. As much as is possible, 
the temperature sensor should be positioned away from any heating 
elements, anodic protective devices, tank walls, and flue pipe walls. If 
the tank cannot accommodate six temperature sensors and meet the 
installation requirements specified above, install the maximum number of 
sensors which comply with the installation requirements. The temperature 
sensors shall be installed either through (1) the anodic device opening; 
(2) the relief valve opening; or (3) the hot water outlet. If installed 
through the relief valve opening or the hot water outlet, a tee fitting 
or outlet piping, as applicable, shall be installed as close as possible 
to its original location. If the relief valve temperature sensor is 
relocated, and it no longer extends into the top of the tank, a 
substitute relief valve that has a sensing element that can reach into 
the tank shall be installed. If the hot water outlet includes a heat 
trap, the heat trap shall be installed on top of the tee fitting. Added 
fittings shall be covered with thermal insulation having an R value 
between 4 and 8 h<SUP>0</SUP>ft<SUP>2/</SUP> [deg]F/Btu (0.7 and 1.4 
m<SUP>2/</SUP> [deg]C/W).
    4.6 Ambient Air Temperature Measurement. Install an ambient air 
temperature sensor at the vertical mid-point of the water heater and 
approximately 2 feet (610 mm) from the surface of the water heater. The 
sensor shall be shielded against radiation.
    4.7 Inlet and Outlet Water Temperature Measurements. Install 
temperature sensors in the cold-water inlet pipe and hot-water outlet 
pipe as shown in Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7a and 7b, as applicable.
    4.8 Flow Control. A valve shall be installed to provide flow as 
specified in sections 5.1.4.1 for storage tank water heaters and 5.2.1 
for instantaneous water heaters.
    4.9 Flue Requirements.
    4.9.1 Gas-Fired Water Heaters. Establish a natural draft in the 
following manner. For gas-fired water heaters with a vertically 
discharging draft hood outlet, a 5-foot (1.5-meter) vertical vent pipe 
extension with a diameter equal to the largest flue collar size of the 
draft hood shall be connected to the draft hood outlet. For gas-fired 
water heaters with a horizontally discharging draft hood outlet, a 90-
degree elbow with a diameter equal to the largest flue collar size of 
the draft hood shall be connected to the draft hood outlet. A 5-foot 
(1.5-meter) length of vent pipe shall be connected to the elbow and 
oriented to discharge vertically upward. Direct vent gas-fired water 
heaters shall be installed with venting equipment specified in the 
manufacturer's instructions using the minimum vertical and horizontal 
lengths of vent pipe recommended by the manufacturer.
    4.9.2 Oil-Fired Water Heaters. Establish a draft at the flue collar 
at the value specified in the manufacturer's instructions. Establish the 
draft by using a sufficient length of vent pipe connected to the water 
heater flue outlet, and directed vertically upward. For an oil-fired 
water heater with a horizontally discharging draft hood outlet, a 90-
degree elbow with a diameter equal to the largest flue collar size of 
the draft hood shall be connected to the draft hood outlet. A length of 
vent pipe sufficient to establish the draft shall be connected to the 
elbow fitting and oriented to discharge vertically upward. Direct-vent 
oil-fired water heaters should be installed with venting equipment as 
specified in the manufacturer's instructions, using the minimum vertical 
and horizontal lengths of vent pipe recommended by the manufacturer.
    4.10 Heat Pump Water Heater Storage Tank. The tank to be used for 
testing a heat pump water heater without a tank supplied by the 
manufacturer (see Section 1.12.3b) shall be an electric storage-type 
water heater having a measured volume of 47.0 gallons <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>1.0 gallon (178 liters <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3.8 
liters); two 4.5 kW heating elements controlled in such a manner as to 
prevent both elements from operating simultaneously; and an energy 
factor greater than or equal to the minimum energy conservation standard 
(as determined in accordance with Section 6.1.7) and less than or equal 
to the sum of the minimum energy conservation standard and 0.02.

                           5. Test Procedures

    5.1 Storage-type Water Heaters, Including Heat Pump Water Heaters.
    5.1.1 Determination of Storage Tank Volume. Determine the storage 
capacity, V<INF>st</INF>, of the water heater under test, in gallons 
(liters), by subtracting the tare weight--measured while the tank is 
empty--from the gross weight of the storage tank when completely filled 
with water (with all air eliminated and line pressure applied as 
described in section 2.5) and dividing the resulting net weight by the 
density of water at the measured temperature.
    5.1.2 Setting the Thermostat.
    5.1.2.1 Single Thermostat Tanks. Starting with a tank at the supply 
water temperature, initiate normal operation of the water heater. After 
cut-out, determine the mean tank temperature every minute until the 
maximum value is observed. Determine whether this maximum value for the 
mean tank temperature is within the range of 135 [deg]F<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F (57.2 [deg]C<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8 [deg]C). 
If not, turn off the water heater, adjust the thermostat, drain and 
refill the tank with supply water. Then, once again, initiate normal 
operation of the water heater, and determine the maximum mean tank 
temperature after cut-out. Repeat this sequence until the maximum mean

[[Page 187]]

tank temperature after cut-out is 135 [deg]F<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 
[deg]F (57.2 [deg]C<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8 [deg]C).
    5.1.2.2 Tanks with Two or More Thermostats. Follow the same sequence 
as for a single thermostat tank, i.e. start at the supply water 
temperature, operate normally until cutout. Determine if the thermostat 
that controls the uppermost heating element yields a maximum water 
temperature of 135 [deg]F<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F (57.2 
[deg]C<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8 [deg]C), as measured by the in-tank 
sensors that are positioned above the uppermost heating element. If the 
tank temperature at the thermostat is not within 135 [deg]F<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F (57.2 [deg]C<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8 [deg]C), 
turn off the water heater, adjust the thermostat, drain and refill the 
tank with supply water. The thermostat that controls the heating element 
positioned next highest in the tank shall then be set to yield a maximum 
water temperature of 135 [deg]F<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F (57.2 
[deg]C<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8 [deg]C). This process shall be repeated 
until the thermostat controlling the lowest element is correctly 
adjusted. When adjusting the thermostat that controls the lowest 
element, the maximum mean tank temperature after cut-out, as determined 
using all the in-tank sensors, shall be 135 [deg]F<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F (57.2 [deg]C<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8 [deg]C). 
When adjusting all other thermostats, use only the in-tank temperature 
sensors positioned above the heating element in question to evaluate the 
maximum water temperature after cut-out.
    For heat pump water heaters that control an auxiliary resistive 
element, the thermostat shall be set in accordance with the 
manufacturer's installation instructions.
    5.1.3 Power Input Determination. For all water heaters except 
electric types having immersed heating elements, initiate normal 
operation and determine the power input, P, to the main burners 
(including pilot light power, if any) after 15 minutes of operation. If 
the water heater is equipped with a gas appliance pressure regulator, 
the regulator outlet pressure shall be set within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>10% of that recommended by the manufacturer. For oil-
fired water heaters the fuel pump pressure shall be within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>10% of the manufacturer's specified pump pressure. All 
burners shall be adjusted to achieve an hourly Btu (kJ) rating that is 
within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2% of the value specified by the 
manufacturer. For an oil-fired water heater, adjust the burner to give a 
CO<INF>2</INF> reading recommended by the manufacturer and an hourly Btu 
(kJ) rating that is within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2% of that specified by 
the manufacturer. Smoke in the flue may not exceed No. 1 smoke as 
measured by the procedure in ASTM-D-2156-80.
    5.1.4 First-Hour Rating Test.
    5.1.4.1 General. During hot water draws, remove water at a rate of 
3.0<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.25 gallons per minute (11.4<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.95 liters per minute). Collect the water in a 
container that is large enough to hold the volume removed during an 
individual draw and suitable for weighing at the termination of each 
draw. Alternatively, a water meter may be used to directly measure the 
water volume(s) withdrawn.
    5.1.4.2 Draw Initiation Criteria. Begin the first-hour rating test 
by imposing a draw on the storage-type water heater. After completion of 
this first draw, initiate successive draws based on the following 
criteria. For gas-and oil-fired water heaters, initiate successive draws 
when the thermostat acts to reduce the supply of fuel to the main 
burner. For electric water heaters having a single element or multiple 
elements that all operate simultaneously, initiate successive draws when 
the thermostat acts to reduce the electrical input supplied to the 
element(s). For electric water heaters having two or more elements that 
do not operate simultaneously, initiate successive draws when the 
applicable thermostat acts to reduce the electrical input to the element 
located vertically highest in the storage tank. For heat pump waters 
heaters that do not use supplemental resistive heating, initiate 
successive draws immediately after the electrical input to the 
compressor is reduced by the action of the water heater's thermostat. 
For heat pump waters heaters that use supplemental resistive heating, 
initiate successive draws immediately after the electrical input to the 
compressor or the uppermost resistive element is reduced by the action 
of the applicable water heater thermostat. This draw initiation 
criterion for heat pump water heaters that use supplemental resistive 
heating, however, shall only apply when the water located above the 
thermostat at cut-out is heated to 135 [deg]F<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 
[deg]F (57.2 [deg]C<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8 [deg]C).
    5.1.4.3 Test Sequence. Establish normal water heater operation. If 
the water heater is not presently operating, initiate a draw. The draw 
may be terminated anytime after cut-in occurs. After cut-out occurs 
(i.e., all thermostats are satisfied), monitor the internal storage tank 
temperature sensors described in section 4.5 every minute.
    Initiate a draw after a maximum mean tank temperature has been 
observed following cut-out. Record the time when the draw is initiated 
and designate it as an elapsed time of zero ([tau]* = 0). (The 
superscript * is used to denote variables pertaining to the first-hour 
rating test.) Record the outlet water temperature beginning 15 seconds 
after the draw is initiated and at 5-second intervals thereafter until 
the draw is terminated. Determine the maximum outlet temperature that 
occurs during this first draw and record it as T*<INF>max, 1</INF>. For 
the duration of this first draw and all successive draws, in addition, 
monitor the inlet temperature to the water heater to ensure that the 
required 58 [deg]F<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 [deg]F (14.4 [deg]C<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>1.1 [deg]C) test condition is met. Terminate the hot 
water draw when the outlet temperature decreases to T*<INF>max,1</INF>-
25 [deg]F (T*<INF>max,1</INF>-13.9 [deg]C). Record this temperature as

[[Page 188]]

T*<INF>min,1</INF>. Following draw termination, determine the average 
outlet water temperature and the mass or volume removed during this 
first draw and record them as T*<INF>del,1</INF> and M*<INF>1</INF> or 
V*<INF>1</INF>, respectively.
    Initiate a second and, if applicable, successive draw each time the 
applicable draw initiation criteria described in section 5.1.4.2 are 
satisfied. As required for the first draw, record the outlet water 
temperature 15 seconds after initiating each draw and at 5-second 
intervals thereafter until the draw is terminated. Determine the maximum 
outlet temperature that occurs during each draw and record it as 
T*<INF>max, i</INF>, where the subscript i refers to the draw number. 
Terminate each hot water draw when the outlet temperature decreases to 
T*<INF>max, i</INF>-25 [deg]F (T*<INF>max, i</INF>-13.9 [deg]C). Record 
this temperature as T*<INF>min, i</INF>. Calculate and record the 
average outlet temperature and the mass or volume removed during each 
draw (T*<INF>del, i</INF> and M*<INF>i</INF> or V*<INF>i</INF>, 
respectively). Continue this sequence of draw and recovery until one 
hour has elapsed, then shut off the electrical power and/or fuel 
supplied to the water heater.
    If a draw is occurring at an elapsed time of one hour, continue this 
draw until the outlet temperature decreases to T*<INF>max, n</INF>-25 
[deg]F (T*<INF>max, n</INF> -13.9 [deg]C), at which time the draw shall 
be immediately terminated. (The subscript n shall be used to denote 
quantities associated with the final draw.) If a draw is not occurring 
at an elapsed time of one hour, a final draw shall be imposed at one 
hour. This draw shall be immediately terminated when the outlet 
temperature first indicates a value less than or equal to the cut-off 
temperature used for the previous draw (T*<INF>min, n</INF>-1). For 
cases where the outlet temperature is close to T*<INF>min, n</INF>-1, 
the final draw shall proceed for a minimum of 30 seconds. If an outlet 
temperature greater than T*<INF>min, n</INF>-1 is not measured within 30 
seconds, the draw shall be immediately terminated and zero additional 
credit shall be given towards first-hour rating (i.e., M*<INF>n</INF> = 
0 or V*<INF>n</INF> = 0). After the final draw is terminated, calculate 
and record the average outlet temperature and the mass or volume removed 
during the draw (T*<INF>del, n</INF> and M*<INF>n</INF> or 
V*<INF>n</INF>, respectively).
    5.1.5 24-Hour Simulated Use Test. During the simulated use test, a 
total of 64.<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3 1.0 gallons (243<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>3.8 liters) shall be removed. This value is referred to 
as the daily hot water usage in the following text.
    With the water heater turned off, fill the water heater with supply 
water and apply pressure as described in section 2.5. Turn on the water 
heater and associated heat pump unit, if present. After the cut-out 
occurs, the water heater may be operated for up to three cycles of 
drawing until cut-in, and then operating until cut-out, prior to the 
start of the test.
    At this time, record the mean tank temperature (T<INF>o</INF>), and 
the electrical and/or fuel measurement readings, as appropriate. Begin 
the 24-hour simulated use test by withdrawing a volume from the water 
heater that equals one-sixth of the daily hot water usage. Record the 
time when this first draw is initiated and assign it as the test elapsed 
time ([tau]) of zero (0). Record the average storage tank and ambient 
temperature every 15 minutes throughout the 24-hour simulated use test 
unless a recovery or a draw is occurring. At elapsed time intervals of 
one, two, three, four, and five hours from [tau] = 0, initiate 
additional draws, removing an amount of water equivalent to one-sixth of 
the daily hot water usage with the maximum allowable deviation for any 
single draw being <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 gallons (1.9 liters). The 
quantity of water withdrawn during the sixth draw shall be increased or 
decreased as necessary such that the total volume of water withdrawn 
equals 64.3 gallons <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1.0 gallon (243.4 liters 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3.8 liters).
    All draws during the simulated use test shall be made at flow rates 
of 3.0 gallons <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.25 gallons per minute (11.4 
liters <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.95 liters per minute). Measurements of 
the inlet and outlet temperatures shall be made 15 seconds after the 
draw is initiated and at every subsequent 5-second interval throughout 
the duration of each draw. The arithmetic mean of the hot water 
discharge temperature and the cold water inlet temperature shall be 
determined for each draw (T<INF>del, i</INF> and T<INF>in, i</INF>). 
Determine and record the net mass or volume removed (M<INF>i</INF> or 
V<INF>i</INF> ), as appropriate, after each draw.
    At the end of the recovery period following the first draw, record 
the maximum mean tank temperature observed after cut-out, 
T<INF>max, 1</INF>, and the energy consumed by an electric resistance, 
gas or oil-fired water heater, Q<INF>r</INF>. For heat pump water 
heaters, the total electrical energy consumed during the first recovery 
by the heat pump (including compressor, fan, controls, pump, etc.) and, 
if applicable, by the resistive element(s) shall be recorded as 
Q<INF>r</INF>.
    At the end of the recovery period that follows the sixth draw, 
determine and record the total electrical energy and/or fossil fuel 
consumed since the beginning of the test, Q<INF>su</INF>. In preparation 
for determining the energy consumed during standby, record the reading 
given on the electrical energy (watt-hour) meter, the gas meter, and/or 
the scale used to determine oil consumption, as appropriate. Record the 
maximum value of the mean tank temperature after cut-out as 
T<INF>su</INF>. Except as noted below, allow the water heater to remain 
in the standby mode until 24 hours have elapsed from the start of the 
test (i.e., since = 0). Prevent the water heater from beginning a 
recovery cycle during the last hour of the test by turning off the 
electric power to the electrical heating elements and heat pump, if 
present, or by turning down the fuel supply to the main burner at

[[Page 189]]

an elapsed time of 23 hours. If a recovery is taking place at an elapsed 
time of 23 hours, wait until the recovery is complete before reducing 
the electrical and/or fuel supply to the water heater. At 24 hours, 
record the mean tank temperature, T<INF>24</INF>, and the electric and/
or fuel instrument readings. Determine the total fossil fuel or 
electrical energy consumption, as appropriate, for the entire 24-hour 
simulated use test, Q. Record the time interval between the time at 
which the maximum mean tank temperature is observed after the sixth draw 
and the end of the 24-hour test as <INF>stby, 1</INF>. Record the time 
during which water is not being withdrawn from the water heater during 
the entire 24-hour period as <INF>stby, 2</INF>.
    5.2 Instantaneous Gas and Electric Water Heaters
    5.2.1 Setting the Outlet Discharge Temperature. Initiate normal 
operation of the water heater at the full input rating for electric 
instantaneous water heaters and at the maximum firing rate specified by 
the manufacturer for gas instantaneous water heaters. Monitor the 
discharge water temperature and set to a value of 135 [deg]F <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F (57.2 [deg]C <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8 [deg]C) 
in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. If the water heater 
is not capable of providing this discharge temperature when the flow 
rate is 3.0 gallons <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.25 gallons per minute (11.4 
liters <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.95 liters per minute), then adjust the 
flow rate as necessary to achieve the specified discharge water 
temperature. Record the corresponding flow rate as V<INF>max</INF>.
    5.2.2 Additional Requirements for Variable Input Instantaneous Gas 
Water Heaters. If the instantaneous water heater incorporates a 
controller that permits operation at a reduced input rate, adjust the 
flow rate as necessary to achieve a discharge water temperature of 135 
[deg]F <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F (57.2 [deg]C <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8 [deg]C) while maintaining the minimum input rate. 
Record the corresponding flow rate as V<INF>min</INF>. If an outlet 
temperature of 135 [deg]F <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F (57.2 [deg]C 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8 [deg]C) cannot be achieved at the minimum flow 
rate permitted by the instantaneous water heater, record the flow rate 
as V<INF>min</INF> and the corresponding outlet temperature as 
T<INF>min</INF>.
    5.2.3 Maximum GPM Rating Test for Instantaneous Water Heaters. 
Establish normal water heater operation at the full input rate for 
electric instantaneous water heaters and at the maximum firing rate for 
gas instantaneous water heaters with the discharge water temperature set 
in accordance with Section 5.2.1. During the 10-minute test, either 
collect the withdrawn water for later measurement of the total mass 
removed, or alternatively, use a water meter to directly measure the 
water volume removed.
    After recording the scale or water meter reading, initiate water 
flow throughout the water heater, record the inlet and outlet water 
temperatures beginning 15 seconds after the start of the test and at 
subsequent 5-second intervals throughout the duration of the test. At 
the end of 10 minutes, turn off the water. Determine the mass of water 
collected, M<INF>10m</INF>, in pounds (kilograms), or the volume of 
water, V<INF>10m</INF>, in gallons (liters).
    5.2.4 24-hour Simulated Use Test for Gas Instantaneous Water 
Heaters.
    5.2.4.1 Fixed Input Instantaneous Water Heaters. Establish normal 
operation with the discharge water temperature and flow rate set to 
values of 135 [deg]F <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F (57.2 [deg]C <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8 [deg]C) and V<INF>max</INF> per Section 5.2.1, 
respectively. With no draw occurring, record the reading given by the 
gas meter and/or the electrical energy meter as appropriate. Begin the 
24-hour simulated use test by drawing an amount of water out of the 
water heater equivalent to one-sixth of the daily hot water usage. 
Record the time when this first draw is initiated and designate it as an 
elapsed time, [tau], of 0. At elapsed time intervals of one, two, three, 
four, and five hours from [tau] = 0, initiate additional draws, removing 
an amount of water equivalent to one-sixth of the daily hot water usage, 
with the maximum allowable deviation for any single draw being <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 gallons (1.9 liters). The quantity of water drawn 
during the sixth draw shall be increased or decreased as necessary such 
that the total volume of water withdrawn equals 64.3 gallons <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>1.0 gallons (243.4 liters <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3.8 
liters).
    Measurements of the inlet and outlet water temperatures shall be 
made 15 seconds after the draw is initiated and at every 5-second 
interval thereafter throughout the duration of the draw. The arithmetic 
mean of the hot water discharge temperature and the cold water inlet 
temperature shall be determined for each draw. Record the scale used to 
measure the mass of the withdrawn water or the water meter reading, as 
appropriate, after each draw. At the end of the recovery period 
following the first draw, determine and record the fossil fuel or 
electrical energy consumed, Q<INF>r</INF>. Following the sixth draw and 
subsequent recovery, allow the water heater to remain in the standby 
mode until exactly 24 hours have elapsed since the start of the test 
(i.e., since [tau] = 0). At 24 hours, record the reading given by the 
gas meter and/or the electrical energy meter as appropriate. Determine 
the fossil fuel or electrical energy consumed during the entire 24-hour 
simulated use test and designate the quantity as Q.
    5.2.4.2 Variable Input Instantaneous Water Heaters. If the 
instantaneous water heater incorporates a controller that permits 
continuous operation at a reduced input rate, the first three draws 
shall be conducted using the maximum flow rate, V<INF>max</INF>, while 
removing an amount of water equivalent to one-sixth of the daily hot 
water usage, with the maximum allowable deviation for any one of the 
three draws being <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 gallons (1.9 liters).

[[Page 190]]

The second three draws shall be conducted at V<INF>min</INF>. If an 
outlet temperature of 135 [deg]F <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F (57.2 
[deg]C <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8 [deg]C) could not be achieved at the 
minimum flow rate permitted by the instantaneous water heater, the last 
three draws should be lengthened such that the volume removed is:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11MY98.001

or
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11MY98.002

where T<INF>min</INF> is the outlet water temperature at the flow rate 
V<INF>min</INF> as determined in Section 5.2.1, and where the maximum 
allowable variation for any one of the three draws is <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 gallons (1.9 liters). The quantity of water 
withdrawn during the sixth draw shall be increased or decreased as 
necessary such that the total volume of water withdrawn equals (32.15 + 
3<INF>/</INF>V<INF>4,5,6</INF>) <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1.0 gallons

((121.7 + 3 / V<INF>4,5,6</INF>) <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3.8 liters).

    Measurements of the inlet and outlet water temperatures shall be 
made 5 seconds after a draw is initiated and at every 5-second interval 
thereafter throughout the duration of the draw. Determine the arithmetic 
mean of the hot water discharge temperature and the cold water inlet 
temperature for each draw. Record the scale used to measure the mass of 
the withdrawn water or the water meter reading, as appropriate, after 
each draw. At the end of the recovery period following the first draw, 
determine and record the fossil fuel or electrical energy consumed, 
Q<INF>r, max</INF>. Likewise, record the reading of the meter used to 
measure fossil fuel or electrical energy consumption prior to the fourth 
draw and at the end of the recovery period following the fourth draw, 
and designate the difference as Q<INF>r,min</INF>. Following the sixth 
draw and subsequent recovery, allow the water heater to remain in the 
standby mode until exactly 24 hours have elapsed since the start of the 
test (i.e., since [tau]=0). At 24 hours, record the reading given by the 
gas meter and/or the electrical energy meter, as appropriate. Determine 
the fossil fuel or electrical energy consumed during the entire 24-hour 
simulated use test and designate the quantity as Q.

/ 2, lb/gal (kg/L).
C<INF>p</INF> = specific heat of the stored water, (T<INF>24</INF> + 
T<INF>o</INF>) / 2, Btu/lb/[deg]F (kJ/kg/[deg]C).

simulated use test, recorded one minute before the first draw is 
initiated, [deg]F ([deg]C).
[eta]<INF>r</INF> = as defined in section 6.1.3.

    6.1.6 Adjusted Daily Water Heating Energy Consumption. The adjusted 
daily water heating energy consumption, Q<INF>da</INF>, takes into 
account that the temperature difference between the storage tank and 
surrounding ambient air may not be the nominal value of 67.5 [deg]F (135 
[deg]F-67.5 [deg]F) or 37.5 [deg]C (57.2 [deg]C-19.7 [deg]C) due to the 
10 [deg]F (5.6 [deg]C) allowable variation in storage tank temperature, 
135 [deg]F <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F (57.2 [deg]C <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8 [deg]C), and the 5 [deg]F (2.8 [deg]C) allowable 
variation in surrounding ambient temperature 65 [deg]F (18.3 [deg]C) to 
70 [deg]F (21.1 [deg]C). The adjusted daily water heating energy 
consumption is computed as:

Qda = QD - [(Tstby, 2 - Ta, stby,2) - (135 [deg]F - 67.5 [deg]F)] 
UA[tau]stby, 2
or Qda = QD - [(Tstby, 2 - Ta, stby, 2) - (57.2 [deg]C - 19.7 [deg]C)] 
UA[tau]stby, 2
Where:

Q<INF>da</INF> = the adjusted daily water heating energy consumption,

T<INF>a, stby, 2</INF> = the average ambient temperature during the 
total standby portion, [tau]stby, 2, of the 24-hour test, [deg]F 
([deg]C).
UA = as defined in section 6.1.4.
[tau]<INF>stby, 2</INF> = the number of hours during the 24-hour 
simulated test when water is not being withdrawn from the water heater.

    A modification is also needed to take into account that the 
temperature difference between the outlet water temperature and supply 
water temperature may not be equivalent to the nominal value of 77 
[deg]F (135 [deg]F-58 [deg]F) or 42.8 [deg]C (57.2 [deg]C-14.4 [deg]C). 
The following equations adjust the experimental data to a nominal 77 
[deg]F (42.8 [deg]C) temperature rise.
    The energy used to heat water, Btu/day (kJ/day), may be computed as:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11MY98.011
    
Where:

M<INF>i</INF> = the mass withdrawn for the ith draw (i = 1 to 6), lb 
(kg).

[deg]F (kJ/kg/ [deg]C).

during the ith draw (i=1 to 6), [deg]F ([deg]C).
T<INF>in, i</INF> = the average water inlet temperature measured during 
the ith draw (i=1 to 6), [deg]F ([deg]C).
[eta]<INF>r</INF> = as defined in section 6.1.3.
    The energy required to heat the same quantity of water over a 77 
[deg]F (42.8 [deg]C) temperature rise, Btu/day (kJ/day), is:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11MY98.012

    The difference between these two values is:

Q<INF>HWD</INF> = Q<INF>HW, 77[deg]-F</INF> -Q<INF>HW</INF>
or Q<INF>HWD</INF> = Q<INF>HW,42.8[deg]-F</INF> -Q<INF>HW</INF>
which must be added to the adjusted daily water heating energy 
consumption value. Thus, the daily energy consumption value which takes 
into account that the temperature difference between the storage tank 
and ambient temperature may not be 67.5 [deg]F (37.5 [deg]C) and that 
the temperature rise across the storage tank may not be 77 [deg]F (42.8 
[deg]C) is:

Q<INF>dm</INF> = Q<INF>da</INF> + Q<INF>HWD</INF>

    6.1.7 Energy Factor. The energy factor, Ef, is computed as:

(kg).

[deg]F (kJ/kg [deg]C).

    6.1.8 Annual Energy Consumption. The annual energy consumption for 
storage-type and heat pump water heaters is computed as:

E<INF>annual</INF> = 365 x Q<INF>dm</INF>

Where:

Q<INF>dm</INF> = the modified daily water heating energy consumption as 
computed in accordance with section 6.1.6, Btu (kJ).
365 = the number of days in a year.

Where:

point where the flow volume is measured, lb/gal (kg/L).
C<INF>p1</INF> = specific heat of the withdrawn water, 
(T<INF>del,1</INF> + T<INF>in,1</INF>) / 2, Btu/lb [deg]F (kJ/kg 
[deg]C).

the first draw of the 24-hour simulated use test, [deg]F ([deg]C).

including auxiliary energy such as pilot lights, pumps, fans, etc., Btu 
(kJ). (Electrical auxiliary energy shall be converted to thermal energy 
using the following conversion: 1 kWh = 3,412 Btu.)
    6.2.2.2 Variable Input Instantaneous Water Heaters. For 
instantaneous water heaters that have a variable firing rate, two 
recovery efficiency values are computed, one at the maximum input rate 
and one at the minimum input rate. The recovery efficiency used in 
subsequent computations is taken as the average of these two values. The 
maximum recovery efficiency is computed as:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11MY98.019

Where:

M<INF>1</INF> = as defined in section 6.2.2.1.
C<INF>p1</INF> = as defined in section 6.2.2.1.

Where:

M<INF>4</INF> = the mass withdrawn during the fourth draw, lb (kg), or, 
if the volume of water is being measured,
M<INF>4</INF> = V<INF>4</INF> [rho]

Where:

hour simulated use test, gal (L).

Where:

[eta]<INF>r,max</INF> = as calculated above.
[eta]<INF>r,min</INF> = as calculated above.

    6.2.3 Daily Water Heating Energy Consumption. The daily water 
heating energy consumption, Q<INF>d</INF>, is computed as:

Qd = Q

Where:

Q = the energy used by the instantaneous water heater during the 24-hr 
simulated use test.

    A modification is needed to take into account that the temperature 
difference between the outlet water temperature and supply water 
temperature may not be equivalent to the nominal value of 77 [deg]F (135 
[deg]F-58 [deg]F) or 42.8 [deg]C (57.2 [deg]C-14.4 [deg]C). The 
following equations adjust the experimental data to a nominal 77 [deg]F 
(42.8 [deg]C) temperature rise.
    The energy used to heat water may be computed as:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11MY98.022

    The energy required to heat the same quantity of water over a 77 
[deg]F (42.8 [deg]C) temperature rise is:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11MY98.023

Where:

M<INF>i</INF> = the mass withdrawn during the ith draw, lb (kg).
C<INF>pi</INF> = the specific heat of water of the ith draw, Btu/lb 
[deg]F (kJ/kg ([deg]C).
[eta]<INF>r</INF> = as calculated above.

    The difference between these two values is:

QHWD = QHW, 77 [deg]F - QHW
or QHWD = QHW, 42.8 [deg]C - QHW

which much be added to the daily water heating energy consumption value. 
Thus, the daily energy consumption value which takes into account that 
the temperature rise across the storage tank may not be 77 [deg]F (42.8 
[deg]C) is:

Qdm = Qd + QHWD

    6.2.4 Energy Factor. The energy factor, E<INF>f</INF>, is computed 
as:

(58 [deg]F + 135 [deg]F) / 2, Btu/lb [deg]F [(14.4 [deg]C + 57.2 [deg]C) 
/ 2, kJ/kg [deg]C].

    6.2.5 Annual Energy Consumption. The annual energy consumption for 
instantaneous type water heaters is computed as:

Eannual = 365 x Qdm

Where:

Q<INF>dm</INF> = the modified daily energy consumption, Btu/day (kJ/
day).
365 = the number of days in a year.

                     7. Ratings for Untested Models

    In order to relieve the test burden on manufacturers who offer water 
heaters which differ only in fuel type or power input, ratings for 
untested models may be established in accordance with the following 
procedures. In lieu of the following procedures a manufacturer may elect 
to test the unit for which a rating is sought.
    7.1 Gas Water Heaters. Ratings obtained for gas water heaters using 
natural gas can be used for an identical water heater which utilizes 
propane gas if the input ratings are within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10%.
    7.2 Electric Water Heaters
    7.2.1 First-Hour Rating. If an electric storage-type water heater is 
available with more than one input rating, the manufacturer

[[Page 195]]

shall designate the standard input rating, and the water heater need 
only be tested with heating elements at the designated standard input 
ratings. The first-hour ratings for units having power input rating less 
than the designated standard input rating shall be assigned a first-hour 
rating equivalent to the first draw of the first-hour rating for the 
electric water heater with the standard input rating. For units having 
power inputs greater than the designated standard input rating, the 
first-hour rating shall be equivalent to that measured for the water 
heater with the standard input rating.
    7.2.2 Energy Factor. The energy factor for identical electric 
storage-type water heaters, with the exception of heating element 
wattage, may use the energy factor obtained during testing of the water 
heater with the designated standard input rating.

operates by cycling on and off, adjust or determine the conventional gas 
oven thermostat setting to provide an average internal temperature which 
is 325[deg]<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F (180.6<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8 [deg]C) higher than the room ambient air 
temperature. This shall be done by measuring the maximum and minimum 
temperatures in any three consecutive cut-off/cut-on actions of the gas 
burners, excluding the initial cut-off/cut-on action, by the thermostat 
after the temperature rise of 325[deg]<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F

                    3. Test Methods and Measurements

    3.1 Test methods.
    3.1.1 Conventional oven. Perform a test by establishing the testing 
conditions set forth in Section 2, ``TEST CONDITIONS,'' of this 
Appendix, and adjust any pilot lights of a conventional gas oven in 
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and turn off the gas 
flow to the conventional cooking top, if so equipped. Before beginning 
the test, the conventional oven shall be at its normal nonoperating 
temperature as defined in Section 1.6 and described in Section 2.6. Set 
the conventional oven test block W<INF>1</INF> approximately in the 
center of the usable baking space. If there is a selector switch for 
selecting the mode of operation of the oven, set it for normal baking. 
If an oven permits baking by either forced convection by using a fan, or 
without forced convection, the oven is to be tested in each of those two 
modes. The oven shall remain on for at least one complete

[[Page 203]]

thermostat ``cut-off/cut-on'' of the electrical resistance heaters or 
gas burners after the test block temperature has increased 234 [deg]F 
(130 [deg]C) above its initial temperature.
    3.1.1.1 Self-cleaning operation of a conventional oven. Establish 
the test conditions set forth in Section 2, ``TEST CONDITIONS,'' of this 
Appendix. Adjust any pilot lights of a conventional gas oven in 
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and turn off the gas 
flow to the conventional cooking top. The temperature of the 
conventional oven shall be its normal nonoperating temperature as 
defined in Section 1.6 and described in Section 2.6. Then set the 
conventional oven's self-cleaning process in accordance with the 
manufacturer's instructions. If the self-cleaning process is adjustable, 
use the average time recommended by the manufacturer for a moderately 
soiled oven.
    3.1.1.2 Continuously burning pilot lights of a conventional gas 
oven. Establish the test conditions set forth in Section 2, ``TEST 
CONDITIONS,'' of this Appendix. Adjust any pilot lights of a 
conventional gas oven in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions 
and turn off the gas flow to the conventional cooking top. If a positive 
displacement gas meter is used the, test duration shall be sufficient to 
measure a gas consumption which is at least 200 times the resolution of 
the gas meter.
    3.1.2 Conventional cooking top. Establish the test conditions set 
forth in Section 2, ``TEST CONDITIONS,'' of this Appendix. Adjust any 
pilot lights of a conventional gas cooking top in accordance with the 
manufacturer's instructions and turn off the gas flow to the 
conventional oven(s), if so equipped. The temperature of the 
conventional cooking top shall be its normal nonoperating temperature as 
defined in Section 1.6 and described in Section 2.6. Set the test block 
in the center of the surface unit under test. The small test block, 
W<INF>2</INF>, shall be used on electric surface units of 7 inches (178 
mm) or less in diameter. The large test block, W<INF>3</INF>, shall be 
used on electric surface units over 7 inches (177.8 mm) in diameter and 
on all gas surface units. Turn on the surface unit under test and set 
its energy input rate to the maximum setting. When the test block 
reaches 144 [deg]F (80 [deg]C) above its initial test block temperature, 
immediately reduce the energy input rate to 25<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 
percent of the maximum energy input rate. After 15<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.1 minutes at the reduced energy setting, turn off the 
surface unit under test.
    3.1.2.1 Continuously burning pilot lights of a conventional gas 
cooking top. Establish the test conditions set forth in Section 2, 
``TEST CONDITIONS,'' of this Appendix. Adjust any pilot lights of a 
conventional gas cooking top in accordance with the manufacturer's 
instructions and turn off the gas flow to the conventional oven(s). If a 
positive displacement gas meter is used, the test duration shall be 
sufficient to measure a gas consumption which is at least 200 times the 
resolution of the gas meter.
    3.1.3 Microwave oven.
    3.1.3.1 Microwave oven test energy or power output. Establish the 
testing conditions set forth in Section 2, ``TEST CONDITIONS,'' of this 
Appendix. Follow the test procedure as specified in Section 4, Paragraph 
12.4 of IEC 705 Amendment 2.
    3.2 Test measurements.
    3.2.1 Conventional oven test energy consumption. If the oven 
thermostat controls the oven temperature without cycling on and off, 
measure the energy consumed, E<INF>O</INF>, when the temperature of the 
block reaches T<INF>O</INF> (T<INF>O</INF> is 234 [deg]F (130 [deg]C) 
above the initial block temperature, T<INF>I</INF>). If the oven 
thermostat operates by cycling on and off, make the following series of 
measurements: Measure the block temperature, T<INF>A</INF>, and the 
energy consumed, E<INF>A</INF>, or volume of gas consumed, 
V<INF>A</INF>, at the end of the last ``ON'' period of the conventional 
oven before the block reaches T<INF>O</INF>. Measure the block 
temperature, T<INF>B</INF>, and the energy consumed, E<INF>B</INF>, or 
volume of gas consumed, V<INF>B</INF>, at the beginning of the next 
``ON'' period. Measure the block temperature, T<INF>C</INF>, and the 
energy consumed, E<INF>C</INF>, or volume of gas consumed, 
V<INF>C</INF>, at the end of that ``ON'' period. Measure the block 
temperature, T<INF>D</INF>, and the energy consumed, E<INF>D</INF>, or 
volume of gas consumed, V<INF>D</INF>, at the beginning of the following 
``ON'' period. Energy measurements for E<INF>O</INF>, E<INF>A</INF>, 
E<INF>B</INF>, E<INF>C</INF> and E<INF>D</INF>, should be expressed in 
watt-hours (kJ) for conventional electric ovens and volume measurements 
for V<INF>A</INF>, V<INF>B</INF>, V<INF>C</INF> and V<INF>D</INF> should 
be expressed in standard cubic feet (L) of gas for conventional gas 
ovens. For a gas oven, measure in watt-hours (kJ) any electrical energy, 
E<INF>IO</INF>, consumed by an ignition device or other electrical 
components required for the operation of a conventional gas oven while 
heating the test block to T<INF>O</INF>. The energy consumed by a 
continuously operating clock that is an integral part of the timing or 
temperature control circuit and cannot be disconnected during the test 
may be subtracted from the oven test energy to obtain the test energy 
consumption, E<INF>O</INF> or E<INF>IO</INF>.
    3.2.1.1 Conventional oven average test energy consumption. If the 
conventional oven permits baking by either forced convection or without 
forced convection and the oven thermostat does not cycle on and off, 
measure the energy consumed with the forced convection mode, 
(E<INF>O</INF>)<INF>1</INF>, and without the forced convection mode, 
(E<INF>O</INF>)<INF>2</INF>, when the temperature of the block reaches 
T<INF>O</INF> (T<INF>O</INF> is 234 [deg]F (130 [deg]C) above the 
initial block temperature, T<INF>I</INF>). If the conventional oven 
permits baking by either forced convection or without forced convection 
and the oven thermostat operates by cycling on and off, make the 
following series of measurements with and without the forced convection 
mode: Measure the block

[[Page 204]]

temperature, T<INF>A</INF>, and the energy consumed, E<INF>A</INF>, or 
volume of gas consumed, V<INF>A</INF>, at the end of the last ``ON'' 
period of the conventional oven before the block reaches T<INF>O</INF>. 
Measure the block temperature, T<INF>B</INF>, and the energy consumed, 
E<INF>B</INF>, or volume of gas consumed, V<INF>B</INF>, at the 
beginning of the next ``ON'' period. Measure the block temperature, 
T<INF>C</INF>, and the energy consumed, E<INF>C</INF>, or volume of gas 
consumed, V<INF>C</INF>, at the end of that ``ON'' period. Measure the 
block temperature, T<INF>D</INF>, and the energy consumed, 
E<INF>D</INF>, or volume of gas consumed, V<INF>D</INF>, at the 
beginning of the following ``ON'' period. Energy measurements for 
E<INF>O</INF>, E<INF>A</INF>, E<INF>B</INF>, E<INF>C</INF> and 
E<INF>D</INF> should be expressed in watt-hours (kJ) for conventional 
electric ovens and volume measurements for V<INF>A</INF>, V<INF>B</INF>, 
V<INF>C</INF> and V<INF>D</INF> should be expressed in standard cubic 
feet (L) of gas for conventional gas ovens. For a gas oven that can be 
operated with or without forced convection, measure in watt-hours (kJ) 
any electrical energy consumed by an ignition device or other electrical 
components required for the operation of a conventional gas oven while 
heating the test block to T<INF>O</INF> using the forced convection 
mode, (E<INF>IO</INF>)<INF>1</INF>, and without using the forced 
convection mode, (E<INF>IO</INF>)<INF>2</INF>. The energy consumed by a 
continuously operating clock that is an integral part of the timing or 
temperature control circuit and cannot be disconnected during the test 
may be subtracted from the oven test energy to obtain the test energy 
consumption, (E<INF>O</INF>)<INF>1</INF> and (E<INF>O</INF>)<INF>2</INF> 
or (E<INF>IO</INF>)<INF>1</INF> and (E<INF>IO</INF>)<INF>2</INF>.
    3.2.1.2 Energy consumption of self-cleaning operation. Measure the 
energy consumption, E<INF>S</INF>, in watt-hours (kJ) of electricity or 
the volume of gas consumption, V<INF>S</INF>, in standard cubic feet (L) 
during the self-cleaning test set forth in Section 3.1.1.1. For a gas 
oven, also measure in watt-hours (kJ) any electrical energy, 
E<INF>IS</INF>, consumed by ignition devices or other electrical 
components required during the self-cleaning test. The energy consumed 
by a continuously operating clock that is an integral part of the timing 
or temperature control circuit and cannot be disconnected during the 
test may be subtracted from the self-cleaning test energy to obtain the 
energy consumption, E<INF>S</INF> or E<INF>IS</INF>
    3.2.1.3 Gas consumption of continuously burning pilot lights. 
Measure the gas consumption of the pilot lights, V<INF>OP</INF>, in 
standard cubic feet (L) of gas and the test duration, t<INF>OP</INF>, in 
hours for the test set forth in Section 3.1.1.2. If a gas flow rate 
meter is used, measure the flow rate, Q<INF>OP</INF>, in standard cubic 
feet per hour (L/h).
    3.2.1.4 Clock power. If the conventional oven or conventional range 
includes an electric clock which is on continuously, and the power 
rating in watts (J/s) of this feature is not known, measure the clock 
power, P<INF>CL</INF>, in watts (J/s.) The power rating or measurement 
of continuously operating clocks, that are an integral part of the 
timing or temperature control circuits and cannot be disconnected during 
testing, shall be multiplied by the applicable test period to calculate 
the clock energy consumption, in watt-hours (kJ), during a test. The 
energy consumed by the clock during the test may then be subtracted from 
the test energy to obtain the specified test energy consumption value.
    3.2.2 Conventional surface unit test energy consumption. For the 
surface unit under test, measure the energy consumption, E<INF>CT</INF>, 
in watt-hours (kJ) of electricity or the volume of gas consumption, 
V<INF>CT</INF>, in standard cubic feet (L) of gas and the test block 
temperature, T<INF>CT</INF>, at the end of the 15 minute (reduced input 
setting) test interval for the test specified in Section 3.1.2 and the 
total time, t<INF>CT</INF>, in hours, that the unit is under test. 
Measure any electrical energy, E<INF>IC</INF>, consumed by an ignition 
device of a gas heating element in watt-hours (kJ). The energy consumed 
by a continuously operating clock that is an integral part of the timing 
or temperature control circuit and cannot be disconnected during the 
test may be subtracted from the cooktop test energy to obtain the test 
energy consumption, E<INF>CT</INF> or E<INF>IC</INF>.
    3.2.2.1 Gas consumption of continuously burning pilot lights. If the 
conventional gas cooking top under test has one or more continuously 
burning pilot lights, measure the gas consumed during the test by the 
pilot lights, V<INF>CP</INF>, in standard cubic feet (L) of gas, and the 
test duration, t<INF>CP</INF>, in hours as specified in Section 3.1.2.1. 
If a gas flow rate meter is used, measure the flow rate, Q<INF>CP</INF>, 
in standard cubic feet per hour (L/h).
    3.2.3 Microwave oven test energy consumption and power input. 
Measurements are to be made as specified in Section 4, Paragraphs 12.4 
and 13 of IEC 705 and Amendment 2. Measure the electrical input energy, 
E<INF>M</INF>, in watt-hours (kJ) consumed by the microwave oven during 
the test. Repeat the tests three times unless the power output value 
resulting from the second measurement is within 1.5% of the value 
obtained from the first measurement as stated in Section 4, Paragraphs 
12.6 of IEC 705 Amendment 2. (See 10 CFR 430.22.)

system. If the clothes washer provides consumer selection of variable 
water fill amounts for the adaptive water fill control system, two 
complete sets of tests shall be conducted. The first set of tests shall 
be conducted with the adaptive water fill control system set in the 
setting that will use the greatest amount of energy. The second set of 
tests shall be conducted with the adaptive water fill control system set 
in the setting that will use the smallest amount of energy. Then, the 
results from these two tests shall be averaged to determine the adaptive 
water fill energy consumption value. If a clothes washer with an 
adaptive water fill control system allows consumer selection of manual 
controls as an alternative, both the manual and adaptive modes shall be 
tested and the energy consumption values, E<INF>T</INF>, M<INF>E</INF>, 
and D<INF>E</INF> (if desired), calculated in section 4 for each mode, 
shall be averaged between the manual and adaptive modes.

combination selections.
    3.2.2.2.1 If a clothes washer's temperature combination selections 
are such that the temperature of each warm wash setting that is above 
the mean warm wash temperature (the mean temperature of the coldest and 
warmest warm settings) is matched by a warm wash setting that is an 
equal distance below the mean, then the energy test shall be conducted 
at the mean warm wash temperature if such a selection is provided, or if 
there is no position on the control that permits selection of the mean 
temperature, the energy test shall be conducted with the temperature 
selection set at the next hotter temperature setting that is available 
above the mean.
    3.2.2.2.2 If the multiple warm wash temperature combination 
selections do not meet criteria in section 3.2.2.2.1, the energy test 
shall be conducted with the temperature selection set at the warm wash 
temperature setting that gives the next higher water temperature than 
the mean temperature of the coldest and warmest warm settings.
    3.2.2.3 Clothes washers with multiple temperature settings within a 
temperature combination selection. When a clothes washer is provided 
with a secondary control that can modify the wash or rinse temperature 
within a temperature combination selection, the secondary control shall 
be set to provide the hottest wash temperature available and the hottest 
rinse temperature available. For instance, when the temperature 
combination selection is set for the middle warm wash temperature and a 
secondary control exists which allows this temperature to be increased 
or decreased, the secondary control shall be set to provide the hottest 
warm wash temperature available for the middle warm wash setting.
    3.2.3 Clothes washers that do not lockout any wash/rinse temperature 
combinations in the normal cycle. Test in the normal cycle all 
temperature combination selections that are required to be tested.
    3.2.3.1 Hot water consumption, cold water consumption, and 
electrical energy consumption at maximum fill. Set the water level 
selector at maximum fill available on the clothes washer, if manually 
controlled, and insert the appropriate test load, if applicable. 
Activate the normal cycle of the clothes washer and also any suds-saver 
switch.
    3.2.3.1.1 For automatic clothes washers, set the wash/rinse 
temperature selector to the hottest temperature combination setting. For 
semi-automatic clothes washers, open the hot water faucet valve 
completely and close the cold water faucet valve completely to achieve 
the hottest temperature combination setting.
    3.2.3.1.2 Measure the electrical energy consumption of the clothes 
washer for the complete cycle.

                      7. Waivers and Field Testing

    7.1 Waivers and Field Testing for Non-conventional Clothes Washers. 
Manufacturers of non-conventional clothes washers, such as clothes 
washers with adaptive control systems, must submit a petition for waiver 
pursuant to 10 CFR 430.27 to establish an acceptable test procedure for 
that clothes washer. For these and other clothes washers that have 
controls or systems such that the DOE test procedures yield results that 
are so unrepresentative of the clothes washer's true energy consumption 
characteristics as to provide materially inaccurate comparative

[[Page 222]]

data, field testing may be appropriate for establishing an acceptable 
test procedure. The following are guidelines for field testing which may 
be used by manufacturers in support of petitions for waiver. These 
guidelines are not mandatory and the Department may determine that they 
do not apply to a particular model. Depending upon a manufacturer's 
approach for conducting field testing, additional data may be required. 
Manufacturers are encouraged to communicate with the Department prior to 
the commencement of field tests which may be used to support a petition 
for waiver. Section 7.3 provides an example of field testing for a 
clothes washer with an adaptive water fill control system. Other 
features, such as the use of various spin speed selections, could be the 
subject of field tests.
    7.2 Non-conventional Wash System Energy Consumption Test. The field 
test may consist of a minimum of 10 of the nonconventional clothes 
washers (``test clothes washers'') and 10 clothes washers already being 
distributed in commerce (``base clothes washers''). The tests should 
include a minimum of 50 normal test cycles per clothes washer. The test 
clothes washers and base clothes washers should be identical in 
construction except for the controls or systems being tested. Equal 
numbers of both the test clothes washer and the base clothes washer 
should be tested simultaneously in comparable settings to minimize 
seasonal and/or consumer laundering conditions and/or variations. The 
clothes washers should be monitored in such a way as to accurately 
record the total energy consumption per cycle. At a minimum, the 
following should be measured and recorded throughout the test period for 
each clothes washer: Hot water usage in gallons (or liters), electrical 
energy usage in kilowatt-hours, and the cycles of usage. The field test 
results would be used to determine the best method to correlate the 
rating of the test clothes washer to the rating of the base clothes 
washer. If the base clothes washer is rated at A kWh per year, but field 
tests at B kWh per year, and the test clothes washer field tests at D 
kWh per year, the test unit would be rated as follows:

Ax(D/B)=G kWh per year

    7.3 Adaptive water fill control system field test. Section 3.2.2.1 
defines the test method for measuring energy consumption for clothes 
washers which incorporate control systems having both adaptive and 
alternate manual selections. Energy consumption calculated by the method 
defined in section 3.2.2.1 assumes the adaptive cycle will be used 50 
percent of the time. This section can be used to develop field test data 
in support of a petition for waiver when it is believed that the 
adaptive cycle will be used more than 50 percent of the time. The field 
test sample size should be a minimum of 10 test clothes washers. The 
test clothes washers should be totally representative of the design, 
construction, and control system that will be placed in commerce. The 
duration of field testing in the user's house should be a minimum of 50 
normal test cycles, for each unit. No special instructions as to cycle 
selection or product usage should be given to the field test 
participants, other than inclusion of the product literature pack which 
should be shipped with all units, and instructions regarding filling out 
data collection forms, use of data collection equipment, or basic 
procedural methods. Prior to the test clothes washers being installed in 
the field test locations, baseline data should be developed for all 
field test units by conducting laboratory tests as defined by section 1 
through section 6 of these test procedures to determine the energy 
consumption values. The following data should be measured and recorded 
for each wash load during the test period: wash cycle selected, the mode 
of the clothes washer (adaptive or manual), clothes load dry weight 
(measured after the clothes washer and clothes dryer cycles are 
completed) in pounds, and type of articles in the clothes load (i.e., 
cottons, linens, permanent press, etc.). The wash loads used in 
calculating the in-home percentage split between adaptive and manual 
cycle usage should be only those wash loads which conform to the 
definition of the normal test cycle.
    Calculate:

T=The total number of normal test cycles run during the field test
T<INF>a</INF>=The total number of adaptive control normal test cycles
T<INF>m</INF>=The total number of manual control normal test cycles

    The percentage weighting factors:

P<INF>a</INF>=(T<INF>a</INF>/T) x 100 (the percentage weighting for 
adaptive control selection)
P<INF>m</INF>=(T<INF>m</INF>/T) x 100 (the percentage weighting for 
manual control selection)

    Energy consumption values, E<INF>T</INF>, M<INF>E</INF>, and 
D<INF>E</INF> (if desired) calculated in section 4 for the manual and 
adaptive modes, should be combined using P<INF>a</INF> and P<INF>m</INF> 
as the weighting factors.

   Sec. Appendix J1 to Subpart B of Part 430--Uniform Test Method for 
Measuring the Energy Consumption of Automatic and Semi-Automatic Clothes 
                                 Washers

    The provisions of this appendix J1 shall apply to products 
manufactured beginning January 1, 2004.

                       1. Definitions and Symbols

    1.1 Adaptive control system means a clothes washer control system, 
other than an adaptive water fill control system, which is capable of 
automatically adjusting washer operation or washing conditions based on 
characteristics of the clothes load placed in the clothes container, 
without allowing or requiring consumer intervention or actions. The 
automatic adjustments may, for example, include automatic selection, 
modification, or control of any of the following: wash water 
temperature, agitation or tumble cycle time, number of rinse cycles, and 
spin speed. The characteristics of the clothes load, which could trigger 
such adjustments, could, for example, consist of or be indicated by the 
presence of either soil, soap, suds, or any other additive laundering 
substitute or complementary product.
    Note: Appendix J1 does not provide a means for determining the 
energy consumption of a clothes washer with an adaptive control system. 
Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 430.27, a waiver must be obtained to 
establish an acceptable test procedure for each such clothes washer.
    1.2 Adaptive water fill control system means a clothes washer water 
fill control system which is capable of automatically adjusting the 
water fill level based on the size or weight of the clothes load placed 
in the clothes container, without allowing or requiring consumer 
intervention or actions.
    1.3 Bone-dry means a condition of a load of test cloth which has 
been dried in a dryer at maximum temperature for a minimum of 10 
minutes, removed and weighed before cool down, and then dried again for 
10 minute periods until the final weight change of the load is 1 percent 
or less.
    1.4 Clothes container means the compartment within the clothes 
washer that holds the clothes during the operation of the machine.
    1.5 Compact means a clothes washer which has a clothes container 
capacity of less than 1.6 ft\3\ (45 L).
    1.6 Deep rinse cycle means a rinse cycle in which the clothes 
container is filled with water to a selected level and the clothes load 
is rinsed by agitating it or tumbling it through the water.
    1.7 Energy test cycle for a basic model means (A) the cycle 
recommended by the manufacturer for washing cotton or linen clothes, and 
includes all wash/rinse temperature selections and water levels offered 
in that cycle, and (B) for each other wash/rinse temperature selection 
or water level available on that basic model, the portion(s) of other 
cycle(s) with that temperature selection or water level that, when 
tested pursuant to these test procedures, will contribute to an accurate 
representation of the energy consumption of the basic model as used by 
consumers. Any cycle under (A) or (B) shall include the agitation/tumble 
operation, spin speed(s), wash times, and rinse times applicable to that 
cycle, including water heating time for water heating clothes washers.
    1.8 Load use factor means the percentage of the total number of wash 
loads that a user would wash a particular size (weight) load.
    1.9 Manual control system means a clothes washer control system 
which requires that the consumer make the choices that determine washer 
operation or washing conditions, such as, for example, wash/rinse 
temperature selections, and wash time before starting the cycle.
    1.10 Manual water fill control system means a clothes washer water 
fill control system which requires the consumer to determine or select 
the water fill level.
    1.11 Modified energy factor means the quotient of the cubic foot (or 
liter) capacity of the clothes container divided by the total clothes 
washer energy consumption per cycle, with such energy consumption 
expressed as the sum of the machine electrical energy consumption, the 
hot water energy consumption, and the energy required for removal of the 
remaining moisture in the wash load.
    1.12 Non-water-heating clothes washer means a clothes washer which 
does not have an internal water heating device to generate hot water.
    1.13 Spray rinse cycle means a rinse cycle in which water is sprayed 
onto the clothes for a period of time without maintaining any specific 
water level in the clothes container.
    1.14 Standard means a clothes washer which has a clothes container 
capacity of 1.6 ft\3\ (45 L) or greater.
    1.15 Temperature use factor means, for a particular wash/rinse 
temperature setting, the percentage of the total number of wash loads 
that an average user would wash with that setting.
    1.16 Thermostatically controlled water valves means clothes washer 
controls that have the ability to sense and adjust the hot and cold 
supply water.
    1.17 Uniformly distributed warm wash temperature selection(s) means 
(A) multiple warm wash selections for which the warm wash water 
temperatures have a linear relationship with all discrete warm wash 
selections when the water temperatures are plotted against equally 
spaced consecutive warm wash selections between the hottest warm

[[Page 224]]

wash and the coldest warm wash. If the warm wash has infinite 
selections, the warm wash water temperature has a linear relationship 
with the distance on the selection device (e.g. dial angle or slide 
movement) between the hottest warm wash and the coldest warm wash. The 
criteria for a linear relationship as specified above is that the 
difference between the actual water temperature at any warm wash 
selection and the point where that temperature is depicted on the 
temperature/selection line formed by connecting the warmest and the 
coldest warm selections is less than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent. In 
all cases, the mean water temperature of the warmest and the coldest 
warm selections must coincide with the mean of the ``hot wash'' (maximum 
wash temperature <=135 [deg]F (57.2 [deg]C)) and ``cold wash'' (minimum 
wash temperature) water temperatures within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3.8 
[deg]F (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.1 [deg]C); or (B) on a clothes washer 
with only one warm wash temperature selection, a warm wash temperature 
selection with a water temperature that coincides with the mean of the 
``hot wash'' (maximum wash temperature <=135 [deg]F (57.2 [deg]C)) and 
``cold wash'' (minimum wash temperature) water temperatures within 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3.8 [deg]F (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.1 [deg]C).
    1.18 Warm wash means all wash temperature selections that are below 
the hottest hot, less than 135 [deg]F (57.2 [deg]C), and above the 
coldest cold temperature selection.
    1.19 Water consumption factor means the quotient of the total 
weighted per-cycle water consumption divided by the cubic foot (or 
liter) capacity of the clothes washer.
    1.20 Water-heating clothes washer means a clothes washer where some 
or all of the hot water for clothes washing is generated by a water 
heating device internal to the clothes washer.
    1.21 Symbol usage. The following identity relationships are provided 
to help clarify the symbology used throughout this procedure.

    1.22 Cold rinse means the coldest rinse temperature available on the 
machine (and should be the same rinse temperature selection tested in 
3.7 of this appendix).
    1.23 Warm rinse means the hottest rinse temperature available on the 
machine (and should be the same rinse temperature selection tested in 
3.7 of this appendix).

cloth must be permanently marked identifying the lot number of the 
material. Mixed lots of material shall not be used for testing the 
clothes washers.
    2.6.1.1 The energy test cloth shall not be used for more than 25 
test runs and shall be clean and consist of the following:
    (A) Pure finished bleached cloth, made with a momie or granite 
weave, which is 50 percent cotton and 50 percent polyester and weighs 
5.75 ounces per square yard (195.0 g/m\2\) and has 65 ends on the warp 
and 57 picks on the fill; and
    (B) Cloth material that is 24 inches by 36 inches (61.0 cm by 91.4 
cm) and has been hemmed to 22 inches by 34 inches (55.9 cm by 86.4 cm) 
before washing. The maximum shrinkage after five washes shall not be 
more than four percent on the length and width.
    2.6.1.2 The new test cloths, including energy test cloths and energy 
stuffer cloths, shall be pre-conditioned in a clothes washer in the 
following manner:
    2.6.1.2.1 Wash the test cloth using a commercially available clothes 
washing detergent that is suitable for 135 [deg]F (57.2 [deg]C) wash 
water as recommended by the manufacturer, with the washer set on maximum 
water level. Place detergent in washer and then place the new load to be 
conditioned in the washer. Wash the load for ten minutes in soft water 
(17ppm or less). Wash water is to be hot, and controlled at 135 
[deg]F<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F (57.2 [deg]C <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8 [deg]C). Rinse water temperature is to be cold, and 
controlled at 60 [deg]F <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F (15.6 [deg]C 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8 [deg]C). Rinse the load through a second rinse 
using the same water temperature (if an optional second rinse is

detergent. Place the test cloth in a clothes washer set at the maximum 
water level. Wash the load for ten minutes in soft water (17 ppm 
hardness or less) using 6.0 grams per gallon of water of AHAM Standard 
detergent 2A. The wash temperature is to be controlled to 135 [deg]F 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F (57.2 [deg]C <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8 
[deg]C) and the rinse temperature is to be controlled to 60 [deg]F 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F (15.6 [deg]C <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8

    2.6.4.6 The moisture absorption and retention shall be evaluated for 
each new lot of test cloth by the Standard Extractor Remaining Moisture 
Content (RMC) Test specified in 2.6.5 of this appendix.
    2.6.4.6.1 Repeat the Standard Extractor RMC Test in 2.6.5 of this 
appendix three times.
    2.6.4.6.2 An RMC correction curve shall be calculated as specified 
in 2.6.6 of this appendix.
    2.6.5 Standard Extractor RMC Test Procedure. The following procedure 
is used to evaluate the moisture absorption and retention 
characteristics of a lot of test cloth by measuring the RMC in a 
standard extractor at a specified set of conditions. Table 2.6.5 of this 
appendix is the matrix of test conditions. The 500g requirement will 
only be used if a clothes washer design can achieve spin speeds in the 
500g range. When this matrix is repeated 3 times, a total of 48 
extractor RMC test runs are required. For the purpose of the extractor 
RMC test, the test cloths may be used for up to 60 test runs (after 
preconditioning as specified in 2.6.3 of this appendix).

    2.6.5.1 The standard extractor RMC tests shall be run in a Bock 
Model 215 extractor (having a basket diameter of 19.5 inches, length of 
12 inches, and volume of 2.1 ft\3\), with a variable speed drive (Bock 
Engineered Products, P.O. Box 5127, Toledo, OH 43611) or an equivalent 
extractor with same basket design (i.e. diameter, length, volume, and 
hole configuration) and variable speed drive.
    2.6.5.2 Test Load. Test cloths shall be preconditioned in accordance 
with 2.6.3 of this appendix. The load size shall be 8.4 lbs., consistent 
with 3.8.1 of this appendix.
    2.6.5.3 Procedure.

[[Page 227]]

    2.6.5.3.1 Record the ``bone-dry'' weight of the test load (WI).
    2.6.5.3.2 Soak the test load for 20 minutes in 10 gallons of soft 
(<17 ppm) water. The entire test load shall be submerged. The water 
temperature shall be 100 [deg]F <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F.
    2.6.5.3.3 Remove the test load and allow water to gravity drain off 
of the test cloths. Then manually place the test cloths in the basket of 
the extractor, distributing them evenly by eye. Spin the load at a fixed 
speed corresponding to the intended centripetal acceleration level 
(measured in units of the acceleration of gravity, g) <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>1 g for the intended time period <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 
seconds.
    2.6.5.3.4 Record the weight of the test load immediately after the 
completion of the extractor spin cycle (WC).
    2.6.5.3.5 Calculate the RMC as (WC-WI)/WI.
    2.6.5.3.6 The RMC of the test load shall be measured at three (3) g 
levels: 100g; 200g; and 350g, using two different spin times at each g 
level: 4 minutes; and 15 minutes. If a clothes washer design can achieve 
spin speeds in the 500g range then the RMC of the test load shall be 
measured at four (4) g levels: 100g; 200g; 350g; and 500g, using two 
different spin times at each g level: 4 minutes; and 15 minutes.
    2.6.5.4 Repeat 2.6.5.3 of this appendix using soft (<17 ppm) water 
at 60 [deg]F <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F.
    2.6.6 Calculation of RMC correction curve.
    2.6.6.1 Average the values of 3 test runs and fill in table 2.6.5 of 
this appendix. Perform a linear least-squares fit to relate the standard 
RMC (RMC<INF>standard</INF>) values (shown in table 2.6.6.1 of this 
appendix) to the values measured in 2.6.5 of this appendix:
    (RMC<INF>cloth</INF>): RMC<INF>standard</INF>  A * 
RMC<INF>cloth</INF> + B
Where A and B are coefficients of the linear least-squares fit.

    2.6.6.2. Perform an analysis of variance test using two factors, 
spin speed and lot, to check the interaction of speed and lot. Use the 
values from Table 2.6.5 and Table 2.6.6.1 in the calculation. The ``P'' 
value in the variance analysis shall be greater than or equal to 0.1. If 
the ``P'' value is less than 0.1 the test cloth is unacceptable. ``P'' 
is a theoretically based probability of interaction based on an analysis 
of variance.
    2.6.7 Application of RMC correction curve.
    2.6.7.1 Using the coefficients A and B calculated in 2.6.6.1 of this 
appendix:

RMC<INF>corr</INF> = A * RMC + B
    2.6.7.2 Substitute RMC<INF>corr</INF> values in calculations in 3.8 
of this appendix.
    2.7 Test Load Sizes. Maximum, minimum, and, when required, average 
test load sizes shall be determined using Table 5.1 and the clothes 
container capacity as measured in 3.1.1 through 3.1.5. Test loads shall 
consist of energy test cloths, except that adjustments to the test loads 
to achieve proper weight can be made by the use of energy stuffer cloths 
with no more than 5 stuffer clothes per load.
    2.8 Use of Test Loads. Table 2.8 defines the test load sizes and 
corresponding water fill settings which are to be used when measuring 
water and energy consumptions. Adaptive water fill control system and 
manual water fill control system are defined in section 1 of this 
appendix:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2.8.1 The test load sizes to be used to measure RMC are specified in 
section 3.8.1.
    2.8.2 Test loads for energy and water consumption measurements shall 
be bone dry prior to the first cycle of the test, and dried

[[Page 228]]

to a maximum of 104 percent of bone dry weight for subsequent testing.
    2.8.3 Load the energy test cloths by grasping them in the center, 
shaking them to hang loosely and then put them into the clothes 
container prior to activating the clothes washer.
    2.9 Pre-conditioning.
    2.9.1 Nonwater-heating clothes washer. If the clothes washer has not 
been filled with water in the preceding 96 hours, pre-condition it by 
running it through a cold rinse cycle and then draining it to ensure 
that the hose, pump, and sump are filled with water.
    2.9.2 Water-heating clothes washer. If the clothes washer has not 
been filled with water in the preceding 96 hours, or if it has not been 
in the test room at the specified ambient conditions for 8 hours, pre-
condition it by running it through a cold rinse cycle and then draining 
it to ensure that the hose, pump, and sump are filled with water.
    2.10 Wash time setting. If one wash time is prescribed in the energy 
test cycle, that shall be the wash time setting; otherwise, the wash 
time setting shall be the higher of either the minimum, or 70 percent of 
the maximum wash time available in the energy test cycle.
    2.11 Test room temperature for water-heating clothes washers. 
Maintain the test room ambient air temperature at 75 [deg]F<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F (23.9 [deg]C<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8 [deg]C).

                          3. Test Measurements

    3.1 Clothes container capacity. Measure the entire volume which a 
dry clothes load could occupy within the clothes container during washer 
operation according to the following procedures:
    3.1.1 Place the clothes washer in such a position that the uppermost 
edge of the clothes container opening is leveled horizontally, so that 
the container will hold the maximum amount of water.
    3.1.2 Line the inside of the clothes container with 2 mil (0.051 mm) 
plastic sheet. All clothes washer components which occupy space within 
the clothes container and which are recommended for use with the energy 
test cycle shall be in place and shall be lined with 2 mil (0.051 mm) 
plastic sheet to prevent water from entering any void space.
    3.1.3 Record the total weight of the machine before adding water.
    3.1.4 Fill the clothes container manually with either 60 
[deg]F<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F (15.6 [deg]C<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8 [deg]C) or 100 [deg]F<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 [deg]F 
(37.8 [deg]C<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5.5 [deg]C) water to its uppermost 
edge. Measure and record the weight of water, W, in pounds.
    3.1.5 The clothes container capacity is calculated as follows:

C=W/d.

where:

C=Capacity in cubic feet (liters).
W=Mass of water in pounds (kilograms).
d=Density of water (62.0 lbs/ft\3\ for 100 [deg]F (993 kg/m\3\ for 37.8 
[deg]C) or 62.3 lbs/ft\3\ for 60 [deg]F (998 kg/m\3\ for 15.6 [deg]C)).

    3.2 Procedure for measuring water and energy consumption values on 
all automatic and semi-automatic washers. All energy consumption tests 
shall be performed under the energy test cycle(s), unless otherwise 
specified. Table 3.2 defines the sections below which govern tests of 
particular clothes washers, based on the number of wash/rinse 
temperature selections available on the model, and also, in some 
instances, method of water heating. The procedures prescribed are 
applicable regardless of a clothes washer's washing capacity, loading 
port location, primary axis of rotation of the clothes container, and 
type of control system.
    3.2.1 Inlet water temperature and the wash/rinse temperature 
settings.
    3.2.1.1 For automatic clothes washers set the wash/rinse temperature 
selection control to obtain the wash water temperature desired (extra 
hot, hot, warm, or cold) and cold rinse, and open both the hot and cold 
water faucets.
    3.2.1.2 For semi-automatic washers: (1) For hot water temperature, 
open the hot water faucet completely and close the cold water faucet; 
(2) for warm inlet water temperature, open both hot and cold water 
faucets completely; (3) for cold water temperature, close the hot water 
faucet and open the cold water faucet completely.
    3.2.1.3 Determination of warm wash water temperature(s) to decide 
whether a clothes washer has uniformly distributed warm wash temperature 
selections. The wash water temperature, Tw, of each warm water wash 
selection shall be calculated or measured.
    For non-water-heating clothes washers, calculate Tw as follows:

Tw( [deg]F)=((Hwx135 [deg]F)+(Cwx60 [deg]F))/(Hw+Cw)

 or

Tw( [deg]C)=((Hwx57.2 [deg]C)+(Cwx15.6 [deg]C))/(Hw+Cw)

where:

Hw=Hot water consumption of a warm wash
Cw=Cold water consumption of a warm wash

    For water-heating clothes washers, measure and record the 
temperature of each warm wash selection after fill.
    3.2.2 Total water consumption during the energy test cycle shall be 
measured, including hot and cold water consumption during wash, deep 
rinse, and spray rinse.
    3.2.3 Clothes washers with adaptive water fill/manual water fill 
control systems
    3.2.3.1 Clothes washers with adaptive water fill control system and 
alternate manual water fill control systems. If a clothes washer with an 
adaptive water fill control system allows consumer selection of manual 
controls as an alternative, then both manual and adaptive

[[Page 229]]

modes shall be tested and, for each mode, the energy consumption 
(HE<INF>T</INF>, ME<INF>T</INF>, and D<INF>E</INF>) and water 
consumption (Q<INF>T</INF>), values shall be calculated as set forth in 
section 4. Then the average of the two values (one from each mode, 
adaptive and manual) for each variable shall be used in section 4 for 
the clothes washer.
    3.2.3.2 Clothes washers with adaptive water fill control system.
    3.2.3.2.1. Not user adjustable. The maximum, minimum, and average 
water levels as defined in the following sections shall be interpreted 
to mean that amount of water fill which is selected by the control 
system when the respective test loads are used, as defined in Table 2.8. 
The load usage factors which shall be used when calculating energy 
consumption values are defined in Table 4.1.3.
    3.2.3.2.2 User adjustable. Four tests shall be conducted on clothes 
washers with user adjustable adaptive water fill controls which affect 
the relative wash water levels. The first test shall be conducted with 
the maximum test load and with the adaptive water fill control system 
set in the setting that will give the most energy intensive result. The 
second test shall be conducted with the minimum test load and with the 
adaptive water fill control system set in the setting that will give the 
least energy intensive result. The third test shall be conducted with 
the average test load and with the adaptive water fill control system 
set in the setting that will give the most energy intensive result for 
the given test load. The fourth test shall be conducted with the average 
test load and with the adaptive water fill control system set in the 
setting that will give the least energy intensive result for the given 
test load. The energy and water consumption for the average test load 
and water level, shall be the average of the third and fourth tests.
    3.2.3.3 Clothes washers with manual water fill control system. In 
accordance with Table 2.8, the water fill selector shall be set to the 
maximum water level available on the clothes washer for the maximum test 
load size and set to the minimum water level for the minimum test load 
size. The load usage factors which shall be used when calculating energy 
consumption values are defined in Table 4.1.3.

                      6. Waivers and Field Testing

    6.1 Waivers and Field Testing for Non-conventional Clothes Washers. 
Manufacturers of nonconventional clothes washers, such as clothes 
washers with adaptive control systems, must submit a petition for waiver 
pursuant to 10 CFR 430.27 to establish an acceptable test procedure for 
that clothes washer. For these and other clothes washers that have 
controls or systems such that the DOE test procedures yield results that 
are so unrepresentative of the clothes washer's true energy consumption 
characteristics as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data, 
field testing may be appropriate for establishing an acceptable test 
procedure. The following are guidelines for field testing which may be 
used by manufacturers in support of petitions for waiver. These 
guidelines are not mandatory and the Department may determine that they 
do not apply to a particular model. Depending upon a manufacturer's 
approach for conducting field testing, additional data may be required. 
Manufacturers are encouraged to communicate with the Department prior to 
the commencement of field tests which may be used to support a petition 
for waiver. Section 6.3 provides an example of field testing for a 
clothes washer with an adaptive water fill control system. Other 
features, such as the use of various spin speed selections, could be the 
subject of field tests.
    6.2 Nonconventional Wash System Energy Consumption Test. The field 
test may consist of a minimum of 10 of the nonconventional clothes 
washers (``test clothes washers'') and 10 clothes washers already being 
distributed in commerce (``base clothes washers''). The tests should 
include a minimum of 50 energy test cycles per clothes washer. The test 
clothes washers and base clothes washers should be identical in 
construction except for the controls or systems being tested. Equal 
numbers of both the test clothes washer and the base clothes washer 
should be tested simultaneously in comparable settings to minimize 
seasonal or consumer laundering conditions or variations. The clothes 
washers should be monitored in such a way as to accurately record the 
total energy consumption per cycle. At a minimum, the following should 
be measured and recorded throughout the test period for each clothes 
washer: Hot water usage in gallons (or liters), electrical energy usage 
in kilowatt-hours, and the cycles of usage.
    The field test results would be used to determine the best method to 
correlate the rating of the test clothes washer to the rating of the 
base clothes washer. If the base clothes washer is rated at A kWh per 
year, but field tests at B kWh per year, and the test clothes washer 
field tests at D kWh per year, the test unit would be rated as follows:

Ax(D/B)=G kWh per year

    6.3 Adaptive water fill control system field test. Section 3.2.3.1 
defines the test method for measuring energy consumption for clothes 
washers which incorporate control systems having both adaptive and 
alternate cycle selections. Energy consumption calculated by the method 
defined in section 3.2.3.1 assumes the adaptive cycle will be used 50 
percent of the time. This section can be used to develop field test data 
in support of a petition for waiver when it is believed that the 
adaptive cycle will be used more than 50 percent of the time. The field 
test sample size should be a minimum of 10 test clothes washers. The 
test clothes washers should be totally representative of the design, 
construction, and control system that will be placed in commerce. The 
duration of field testing in the user's house should be a minimum of 50 
energy test cycles, for each unit. No special instructions as to cycle 
selection or product usage should be given to the field test 
participants, other than inclusion of the product literature pack which 
would be shipped with all units, and instructions regarding filling out 
data collection forms, use of data collection equipment, or basic 
procedural methods. Prior to the test clothes washers being installed in 
the field test locations, baseline data should be developed for all 
field test units by conducting laboratory tests as defined by section 1 
through section 5 of these test procedures to determine the energy 
consumption, water

[[Page 235]]

consumption, and remaining moisture content values. The following data 
should be measured and recorded for each wash load during the test 
period: wash cycle selected, the mode of the clothes washer (adaptive or 
manual), clothes load dry weight (measured after the clothes washer and 
clothes dryer cycles are completed) in pounds, and type of articles in 
the clothes load (e.g., cottons, linens, permanent press). The wash 
loads used in calculating the in-home percentage split between adaptive 
and manual cycle usage should be only those wash loads which conform to 
the definition of the energy test cycle.
    Calculate:

T=The total number of energy test cycles run during the field test
T<INF>a</INF>=The total number of adaptive control energy test cycles
T<INF>m</INF>=The total number of manual control energy test cycles

    The percentage weighting factors:

P<INF>a</INF>=(T<INF>a</INF>/T)x100 (the percentage weighting for 
adaptive control selection)
P<INF>m</INF>=(T<INF>m</INF>/T)x100 (the percentage weighting for manual 
control selection)

    Energy consumption (HE<INF>T</INF>, ME<INF>T</INF>, and 
D<INF>E</INF>) and water consumption (Q<INF>T</INF>), values calculated 
in section 4 for the manual and adaptive modes, should be combined using 
P<INF>a</INF> and P<INF>m</INF> as the weighting factors.

430.23 of the Code of Federal Regulations states the calculation 
requirements for this rating descriptor.

    1.14 Constant-air-volume-rate indoor fan means a fan that varies its 
operating speed to provide a fixed air-volume-rate from a ducted system.
    1.15 Continuously recorded, when referring to a dry bulb 
measurement, means that the specified temperature must be sampled at 
regular intervals that are equal to or less than the maximum intervals 
specified in section 4.3 part ``a'' of ASHRAE Standard 41.1-86 (RA 01). 
If such dry bulb temperatures are used only for test room control, it 
means that one samples at regular intervals equal to or less than the 
maximum intervals specified in section 4.3 part ``b'' of the same ASHRAE 
Standard. Regarding wet bulb temperature, dew point temperature, or 
relative humidity measurements, continuously recorded means that the 
measurements must be made at regular intervals that are equal to or less 
than 1 minute.
    1.16 Cooling load factor (CLF) means the ratio having as its 
numerator the total cooling delivered during a cyclic operating interval 
consisting of one ON period and one OFF period. The denominator is the 
total cooling that would be delivered, given the same ambient 
conditions, had the unit operated continuously at its steady-state space 
cooling capacity for the same total time (ON + OFF) interval.
    1.17 Coefficient of Performance (COP) means the ratio of the average 
rate of space heating delivered to the average rate of electrical energy 
consumed by the heat pump. These rate quantities must be determined from 
a single test or, if derived via interpolation, must be tied to a single 
set of operating conditions. COP is a dimensionless quantity. When 
determined for a ducted unit tested without an indoor fan installed, COP 
must include the section 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9.1 default values for the heat 
output and power input of a fan motor.
    1.18 Cyclic Test means a test where the unit's compressor is cycled 
on and off for specific time intervals. A cyclic test provides half the 
information needed to calculate a degradation coefficient.
    1.19 Damper box means a short section of duct having an air damper 
that meets the performance requirements of section 2.5.7.
    1.20 Degradation coefficient (C<INF>D</INF>) means a parameter used 
in calculating the part load factor. The degradation coefficient for 
cooling is denoted by C<INF>D</INF>\c\. The degradation coefficient for 
heating is denoted by C<INF>D</INF>\h\.
    1.21 Demand-defrost control system means a system that defrosts the 
heat pump outdoor coil only when measuring a predetermined degradation 
of performance. The heat pump's controls monitor one or more parameters 
that always vary with the amount of frost accumulated on the outdoor 
coil (e.g., coil to air differential temperature, coil differential air 
pressure, outdoor fan power or current, optical sensors, etc.) at least 
once for every ten minutes of compressor ON-time when space heating. One 
acceptable alternative to the criterion given in the prior sentence is a 
feedback system that measures the length of the defrost period and 
adjusts defrost frequency accordingly.\1\ In all cases, when the frost 
parameter(s) reaches a predetermined value, the system initiates a 
defrost. In a demand-defrost control system, defrosts are terminated 
based on monitoring a parameter(s) that indicates that frost has been 
eliminated from the coil.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Systems that vary defrost intervals according to outdoor dry-
bulb temperature are not demand defrost systems.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A demand-defrost control system, which otherwise meets the above 
requirements,

[[Page 239]]

may allow time-initiated defrosts if, and only if, such defrosts occur 
after 6 hours of compressor operating time.
    1.22 Design heating requirement (DHR) predicts the space heating 
load of a residence when subjected to outdoor design conditions. 
Estimates for the minimum and maximum DHR are provided for six 
generalized U.S. climatic regions in section 4.2.
    1.23 Dry-coil tests are cooling mode tests where the wet-bulb 
temperature of the air supplied to the indoor coil is maintained low 
enough that no condensate forms on this coil.
    1.24 Ducted system means an air conditioner or heat pump that is 
designed to be permanently installed equipment and delivers conditioned 
air to the indoor space through a duct(s). The air conditioner or heat 
pump may be either a split system or a single-packaged unit.
    1.25 Energy efficiency ratio (EER) means the ratio of the average 
rate of space cooling delivered to the average rate of electrical energy 
consumed by the air conditioner or heat pump. These rate quantities must 
be determined from a single test or, if derived via interpolation, must 
be tied to a single set of operating conditions. EER is expressed in 
units of
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.001

When determined for a ducted unit tested without an indoor fan 
installed, EER must include the section 3.3 and 3.5.1 default values for 
the heat output and power input of a fan motor.
    1.26 Heating load factor (HLF) means the ratio having as its 
numerator the total heating delivered during a cyclic operating interval 
consisting of one ON period and one OFF period. The denominator is the 
total heating that would be delivered, given the same ambient 
conditions, if the unit operated continuously at its steady-state space 
heating capacity for the same total time (ON plus OFF) interval.
    1.27 Heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF) means the total 
space heating required during the space heating season, expressed in 
Btu's, divided by the total electrical energy consumed by the heat pump 
system during the same season, expressed in watt-hours. The HSPF used to 
evaluate compliance with the Energy Conservation Standards (see 10 CFR 
430.32(c), Subpart C) is based on Region IV, the minimum standardized 
design heating requirement, and the sampling plan stated in 10 CFR 
430.24(m), Subpart B.
    1.28 Heat pump having a heat comfort controller means equipment that 
regulates the operation of the electric resistance elements to assure 
that the air temperature leaving the indoor section does not fall below 
a specified temperature. This specified temperature is usually field 
adjustable. Heat pumps that actively regulate the rate of electric 
resistance heating when operating below the balance point (as the result 
of a second stage call from the thermostat) but do not operate to 
maintain a minimum delivery temperature are not considered as having a 
heat comfort controller.
    1.29 Mini-split air conditioners and heat pumps means systems that 
have a single outdoor section and one or more indoor sections. The 
indoor sections cycle on and off in unison in response to a single 
indoor thermostat.
    1.30 Multiple-split air conditioners and heat pumps means systems 
that have two or more indoor sections. The indoor sections operate 
independently and can be used to condition multiple zones in response to 
multiple indoor thermostats.
    1.31 Non-ducted system means an air conditioner or heat pump that is 
designed to be permanently installed equipment and directly heats or 
cools air within the conditioned space using one or more indoor coils 
that are mounted on room walls and/or ceilings. The unit may be of a 
modular design that allows for combining multiple outdoor coils and 
compressors to create one overall system. Non-ducted systems covered by 
this test procedure are all split systems.
    1.32 Part-load factor (PLF) means the ratio of the cyclic energy 
efficiency ratio (coefficient of performance) to the steady-state energy 
efficiency ratio (coefficient of performance). Evaluate both energy 
efficiency ratios (coefficients of performance) based on operation at 
the same ambient conditions.
    1.33 Seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) means the total heat 
removed from the conditioned space during the annual cooling season, 
expressed in Btu's, divided by the total electrical energy consumed by 
the air conditioner or heat pump during the same season, expressed in 
watt-hours. The SEER calculation in section 4.1 of this Appendix and the 
sampling plan stated in 10 CFR Subpart B, 430.24(m) are used to evaluate 
compliance with the Energy Conservation Standards. (See 10 CFR 
430.32(c), Subpart C.)
    1.34 Single-packaged unit means any central air conditioner or heat 
pump that has all major assemblies enclosed in one cabinet.
    1.35 Small-duct, high-velocity system means a system that contains a 
blower and indoor coil combination that is designed for, and produces, 
at least 1.2 inches (of water) of external static pressure when operated 
at the certified air volume rate of 220-350 cfm per rated ton of 
cooling. When applied in the field, small-duct products use high-
velocity room outlets (i.e., generally greater than 1000 fpm) having 
less than 6.0 square inches of free area.

[[Page 240]]

    1.36 Split system means any air conditioner or heat pump that has 
one or more of the major assemblies separated from the others.
    1.37 Standard Air means dry air at 70 [deg]F and 14.696 psia. Under 
these conditions, dry air has a mass density of 0.075 lb/ft\3\.
    1.38 Steady-state test means a test where the test conditions are 
regulated to remain as constant as possible while the unit operates 
continuously in the same mode.
    1.39 Temperature bin means the 5 [deg]F increments that are used to 
partition the outdoor dry-bulb temperature ranges of the cooling 
(<ls-thn-eq>= 65 [deg]F) and heating (< 65 [deg]F) seasons.
    1.40 Test condition tolerance means the maximum permissible 
difference between the average value of the measured test parameter and 
the specified test condition.
    1.41 Test operating tolerance means the maximum permissible range 
that a measurement may vary over the specified test interval. The 
difference between the maximum and minimum sampled values must be less 
than or equal to the specified test operating tolerance.
    1.42 Time adaptive defrost control system is a demand-defrost 
control system (see definition 1.21) that measures the length of the 
prior defrost period(s) and uses that information to automatically 
determine when to initiate the next defrost cycle.
    1.43 Time-temperature defrost control systems initiate or evaluate 
initiating a defrost cycle only when a predetermined cumulative 
compressor ON-time is obtained. This predetermined ON-time is generally 
a fixed value (e.g., 30, 45, 90 minutes) although it may vary based on 
the measured outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The ON-time counter 
accumulates if controller measurements (e.g., outdoor temperature, 
evaporator temperature) indicate that frost formation conditions are 
present, and it is reset/remains at zero at all other times. In one 
application of the control scheme, a defrost is initiated whenever the 
counter time equals the predetermined ON-time. The counter is reset when 
the defrost cycle is completed.
    In a second application of the control scheme, one or more 
parameters are measured (e.g., air and/or refrigerant temperatures) at 
the predetermined, cumulative, compressor ON-time. A defrost is 
initiated only if the measured parameter(s) falls within a predetermined 
range. The ON-time counter is reset regardless of whether a defrost is 
initiated. If systems of this second type use cumulative ON-time 
intervals of 10 minutes or less, then the heat pump may qualify as 
having a demand defrost control system (see definition 1.21).
    1.44 Triple-split system means an air conditioner or heat pump that 
is composed of three separate components: An outdoor fan coil section, 
an indoor fan coil section, and an indoor compressor section.
    1.45 Two-capacity (or two-stage) compressor means an air conditioner 
or heat pump that has one of the following:
    (1) A two-speed compressor,
    (2) Two compressors where only one compressor ever operates at a 
time,
    (3) Two compressors where one compressor (Compressor <greek-i>1) 
operates at low loads and both compressors (Compressors <greek-i>1 and 
<greek-i>2) operate at high loads but Compressor <greek-i>2 never 
operates alone, or
    (4) A compressor that is capable of cylinder or scroll unloading.
    For such systems, low capacity means:
    (1) Operating at low compressor speed,
    (2) Operating the lower capacity compressor,
    (3) Operating Compressor <greek-i>1, or
    (4) Operating with the compressor unloaded (e.g., operating one 
piston of a two-piston reciprocating compressor, using a fixed 
fractional volume of the full scroll, etc.).
    For such systems, high capacity means:
    (1) Operating at high compressor speed,
    (2) Operating the higher capacity compressor,
    (3) Operating Compressors <greek-i>1 and <greek-i>2, or
    (4) Operating with the compressor loaded (e.g., operating both 
pistons of a two-piston reciprocating compressor, using the full volume 
of the scroll).
    1.46 Two-capacity, northern heat pump means a heat pump that has a 
factory or field-selectable lock-out feature to prevent space cooling at 
high-capacity. Two-capacity heat pumps having this feature will 
typically have two sets of ratings, one with the feature disabled and 
one with the feature enabled. The indoor coil model number should 
reflect whether the ratings pertain to the lockout enabled option via 
the inclusion of an extra identifier, such as ``+LO.'' When testing as a 
two-capacity, northern heat pump, the lockout feature must remain 
enabled for all tests.
    1.47 Wet-coil test means a test conducted at test conditions that 
typically cause water vapor to condense on the test unit evaporator 
coil.

                          2. Testing Conditions

    This test procedure covers split-type and single-packaged ducted 
units and split-type non-ducted units. Except for units having a 
variable-speed compressor, ducted units tested without an indoor fan 
installed are covered.
    a. Only a subset of the sections listed in this test procedure apply 
when testing and rating a particular unit. Tables 1-A through 1-C show 
which sections of the test procedure apply to each type of equipment. In 
each table, look at all four of the Roman numeral categories to see what 
test sections apply to the equipment being tested.

[[Page 241]]

    1. The first category, Rows I-1 through I-4 of the Tables, pertains 
to the compressor and indoor fan features of the equipment. After 
identifying the correct ``I'' row, find the table cells in the same row 
that list the type of equipment being tested: Air conditioner (AC), heat 
pump (HP), or heating-only heat pump (HH). Use the test section(s) 
listed above each noted table cell for testing and rating the unit.
    2. The second category, Rows II-1 and II-2, pertains to the presence 
or absence of ducts. Row II-1 shows the test procedure sections that 
apply to ducted systems, and Row II-2 shows those that apply to non-
ducted systems.
    3. The third category is for special features that may be present in 
the equipment. When testing units that have one or more of the three 
(special) equipment features described by the Table legend for Category 
III, use Row III to find test sections that apply.
    4. The fourth category is for the secondary test method to be used. 
If the secondary method for determining the unit's cooling and/or 
heating capacity is known, use Row IV to find the appropriate test 
sections. Otherwise, include all of the test sections referenced by Row 
IV cell entries--i.e., sections 2.10 to 2.10.3 and 3.11 to 3.11.3--among 
those sections consulted for testing and rating information.
    b. Obtain a complete listing of all pertinent test sections by 
recording those sections identified from the four categories above.
    c. The user should note that, for many sections, only part of a 
section applies to the unit being tested. In a few cases, the entire 
section may not apply. For example, sections 3.4 to 3.5.3 (which 
describe optional dry coil tests), are not relevant if the allowed 
default value for the cooling mode cyclic degradation coefficient is 
used rather than determining it by testing.

    2.1 Test room requirements. a. Test using two side-by-side rooms, an 
indoor test room and an outdoor test room. These rooms must comply with 
the requirements specified in sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.3 of ASHRAE 
Standard 37-88 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22).
    b. Inside these test rooms, use artificial loads during cyclic tests 
and frost accumulation tests, if needed, to produce stabilized room air 
temperatures. For one room, select an electric resistance heater(s) 
having a heating capacity that is approximately equal to the heating 
capacity of the test unit's condenser. For the second room, select a 
heater(s) having a capacity that is close to the sensible cooling 
capacity of the test unit's evaporator. When applied, cycle the heater 
located in the same room as the test unit evaporator coil ON and OFF 
when the test unit cycles ON and OFF. Cycle the heater located in the 
same room as the test unit condensing coil ON and OFF when the test unit 
cycles OFF and ON.

[[Page 246]]

    2.2 Test unit installation requirements. a. Install the unit 
according to section 8.6 of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 430.22). With respect to interconnecting tubing 
used when testing split systems, however, follow the requirements given 
in section 6.1.3.5 of ARI Standard 210/240-2003 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 430.22). When testing triple-split systems (see 
Definition 1.44), use the tubing length specified in section 6.1.3.5 of 
ARI Standard 210/240-2003 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22) 
to connect the outdoor coil, indoor compressor section, and indoor coil 
while still meeting the requirement of exposing 10 feet of the tubing to 
outside conditions. When testing non-ducted systems having multiple 
indoor coils, connect each indoor fan-coil to the outdoor unit using: a. 
25 feet of tubing, or b. tubing furnished by the manufacturer, whichever 
is longer. If they are needed to make a secondary measurement of 
capacity, install refrigerant pressure measuring instruments as 
described in section 8.6.5 of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 430.22). Refer to section 2.10 of this Appendix to 
learn which secondary methods require refrigerant pressure measurements. 
At a minimum, insulate the low pressure line(s) of a split system with 
foam insulation having an inside diameter that matches the refrigerant 
tubing and a nominal thickness of \1/2\ inch.
    b. For units designed for both horizontal and vertical installation 
or for both up-flow and down-flow vertical installations, the 
manufacturer must specify the orientation used for testing. Conduct 
testing with the following installed:
    (1) The most restrictive filter(s);
    (2) Supplementary heating coils; and
    (3) Other equipment specified as part of the unit, including all 
hardware used by a heat comfort controller if so equipped (see 
Definition 1.28).
    c. Testing a ducted unit without having an indoor air filter 
installed is permissible as long as the minimum external static pressure 
requirement is adjusted as stated in Table 2, note 3 (see section 
3.1.4). Except as noted in section 3.1.9, prevent the indoor air 
supplementary heating coils from operating during all tests. For coil-
only indoor units that are supplied without an enclosure, create an 
enclosure using 1 inch fiberglass ductboard having a nominal density of 
6 pounds per cubic foot. Or alternatively, use some other insulating 
material having a thermal resistance (``R'' value) between 4 and 6 
hr[middot]ft\2\[middot] [deg]F/Btu. For units where the coil is housed 
within an enclosure or cabinet, no extra insulating or sealing is 
allowed.
    2.2.1 Defrost control settings. Set heat pump defrost controls at 
the normal settings which most typify those encountered in generalized 
climatic region IV. (Refer to Figure 2 and Table 17 of section 4.2 for 
information on region IV.) For heat pumps that use a time-adaptive 
defrost control system (see Definition 1.42), the manufacturer must 
specify the frosting interval to be used during Frost Accumulation tests 
and provide the procedure for manually initiating the defrost at the 
specified time. To ease testing of any unit, the manufacturer should 
provide information and any necessary hardware to manually initiate a 
defrost cycle.
    2.2.2 Special requirements for units having a multiple-speed outdoor 
fan. Configure the multiple-speed outdoor fan according to the 
manufacturer's specifications, and thereafter, leave it unchanged for 
all tests. The controls of the unit must regulate the operation of the 
outdoor fan during all lab tests except dry coil cooling mode tests. For 
dry coil cooling mode tests, the outdoor fan must operate at the same 
speed used during the required wet coil test conducted at the same 
outdoor test conditions.
    2.2.3 Special requirements for multi-split air conditioners and heat 
pumps, and systems composed of multiple mini-split units (outdoor units 
located side-by-side) that would normally operate using two or more 
indoor thermostats. During the steady-state tests, shunt all thermostats 
to make all indoor fan-coil units operate simultaneously. To ease the 
testing burden of cyclic tests, consider creating a single control 
circuit that allows simultaneous cycling of all compressor systems. For 
these systems, the test procedure references to a single indoor fan, 
outdoor fan, and compressor means all indoor fans, all outdoor fans, and 
all compressor systems.
    2.2.4 Wet-bulb temperature requirements for the air entering the 
indoor and outdoor coils.
    2.2.4.1 Cooling mode tests. For wet-coil cooling mode tests, 
regulate the water vapor content of the air entering the indoor unit to 
the applicable wet-bulb temperature listed in Tables 3 to 6. As noted in 
these same tables, achieve a wet-bulb temperature during dry-coil 
cooling mode tests that results in no condensate forming on the indoor 
coil. Controlling the water vapor content of the air entering the 
outdoor side of the unit is not required for cooling mode tests except 
when testing:
    (1) Units that reject condensate to the outdoor coil during wet coil 
tests. Tables 3-6 list the applicable wet-bulb temperatures.
    (2) Single-packaged units where all or part of the indoor section is 
located in the outdoor test room. The average dew point temperature of 
the air entering the outdoor coil during wet coil tests must be within 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3.0 [deg]F of the average dew point temperature of 
the air entering the indoor coil over the 30-minute data collection 
interval described in section 3.3. For dry coil tests on such units, it 
may be necessary to limit the moisture content of the air entering the 
outdoor side

[[Page 247]]

of the unit to meet the requirements of section 3.4.
    2.2.4.2 Heating mode tests. For heating mode tests, regulate the 
water vapor content of the air entering the outdoor unit to the 
applicable wet-bulb temperature listed in Tables 9 to 12. The wet-bulb 
temperature entering the indoor side of the heat pump must not exceed 60 
[deg]F. Additionally, if the Outdoor Air Enthalpy test method is used 
while testing a single-packaged heat pump where all or part of the 
outdoor section is located in the indoor test room, adjust the wet-bulb 
temperature for the air entering the indoor side to yield an indoor-side 
dew point temperature that is as close as reasonably possible to the dew 
point temperature of the outdoor-side entering air.
    2.2.5 Additional refrigerant charging requirements. Charging 
according to the ``manufacturer's instructions,'' as stated in section 
8.6 of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 
430.22), means the manufacturer's installation instructions that come 
packaged with the unit. If a unit requires charging but the installation 
instructions do not specify a charging procedure, then evacuate the unit 
and add the nameplate refrigerant charge. Where the manufacturer's 
installation instructions contain two sets of refrigerant charging 
criteria, one for field installations and one for lab testing, use the 
field installation criteria. For third-party testing, the test 
laboratory may consult with the manufacturer about the refrigerant 
charging procedure and make any needed corrections so long as they do 
not contradict the published installation instructions. The manufacturer 
may specify an alternative charging criteria to the third-party 
laboratory so long as the manufacturer thereafter revises the published 
installation instructions accordingly.
    2.3 Indoor air volume rates. If a unit's controls allow for 
overspeeding the indoor fan (usually on a temporary basis), take the 
necessary steps to prevent overspeeding during all tests.
    2.3.1 Cooling tests. a. Set indoor fan control options (e.g., fan 
motor pin settings, fan motor speed) according to the published 
installation instructions that are provided with the equipment while 
meeting the airflow requirements that are specified in sections 3.1.4.1 
to 3.1.4.3.
    b. Express the Cooling Certified Air Volume Rate, the Cooling 
Minimum Air Volume Rate, and the Cooling Intermediate Air Volume Rate in 
terms of standard air.
    2.3.2 Heating tests. a. If needed, set the indoor fan control 
options (e.g., fan motor pin settings, fan motor speed) according to the 
published installation instructions that are provided with the 
equipment. Do this set-up while meeting all applicable airflow 
requirements specified in sections 3.1.4.4 to 3.1.4.7.
    b. Express the Heating Certified Air Volume Rate, the Heating 
Minimum Air Volume Rate, the Heating Intermediate Air Volume Rate, and 
the Heating Nominal Air Volume Rate in terms of standard air.
    2.4 Indoor coil inlet and outlet duct connections. Insulate and/or 
construct the outlet plenum described in section 2.4.1 and, if 
installed, the inlet plenum described in section 2.4.2 with thermal 
insulation having a nominal overall sistance (R-value) of at least 19 
hr[middot]ft\2\[middot] [deg]F/Btu.
    2.4.1 Outlet plenum for the indoor unit. Attach a plenum to the 
outlet of the indoor coil. (Note: for some packaged systems, the indoor 
coil may be located in the outdoor test room.) For non-ducted systems 
having multiple indoor coils, attach a plenum to each indoor coil 
outlet. Add a static pressure tap to each face of the (each) outlet 
plenum, if rectangular, or at four evenly distributed locations along 
the circumference of an oval or round plenum. Create a manifold that 
connects the four static pressure taps. Figure 1 shows two of the three 
options allowed for the manifold configuration; the third option is the 
broken-ring, four-to-one manifold configuration that is shown in Figure 
7 of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 
430.22). See Figures 7 and 8 of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 430.22) for the cross-sectional dimensions and 
minimum length of the (each) plenum and the locations for adding the 
static pressure taps for units tested with and without an indoor fan 
installed. For a non-ducted system having multiple indoor coils, have 
all outlet plenums discharge air into a single common duct. At the plane 
where each plenum enters the common duct, install an adjustable airflow 
damper and use it to equalize the static pressure in each plenum.

[[Page 248]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.171

    2.4.2 Inlet plenum for the indoor unit. Install an inlet plenum when 
testing a coil-only indoor unit or a packaged system where the indoor 
coil is located in the outdoor test room. Add static pressure taps at 
the center of each face of this plenum, if rectangular, or at four 
evenly distributed locations along the circumference of an oval or round 
plenum. Make a manifold that connects the four static pressure taps 
using one of the three configurations specified in section 2.4.1. See 
Figure 8 of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 
430.22) for cross-sectional dimensions, the minimum length of the inlet 
plenum, and the locations of the static pressure taps. When testing a 
ducted unit having an indoor fan (and the indoor coil is in the indoor 
test room), the manufacturer has the option to test with or without an 
inlet plenum installed. Space limitations within the test room may 
dictate that the manufacturer choose the latter option. If used, 
construct the inlet plenum and add the four static pressure taps as 
shown in Figure 8 of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 (incorporated by reference, 
see Sec. 430.22). Manifold the four static pressure taps using one of 
the three configurations specified in section 2.4.1. Never use an inlet 
plenum when testing a non-ducted system.

[[Page 249]]

    2.5 Indoor coil air property measurements and air damper box 
applications. a. Measure the dry-bulb temperature and water vapor 
content of the air entering and leaving the indoor coil. If needed, use 
an air sampling device to divert air to a sensor(s) that measures the 
water vapor content of the air. See Figure 2 of ASHRAE Standard 41.1-86 
(RA 01) (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22) for guidance on 
constructing an air sampling device. The sampling device may also divert 
air to a remotely located sensor(s) that measures dry bulb temperature. 
The air sampling device and the remotely located temperature sensor(s) 
may be used to determine the entering air dry bulb temperature during 
any test. The air sampling device and the remotely located leaving air 
dry bulb temperature sensor(s) may be used for all tests except:
    (1) Cyclic tests; and
    (2) Frost accumulation tests.
    b. An acceptable alternative in all cases, including the two special 
cases noted above, is to install a grid of dry bulb temperature sensors 
within the outlet and inlet ducts. Use a temperature grid to get the 
average dry bulb temperature at one location, leaving or entering, or 
when two grids are applied as a thermopile, to directly obtain the 
temperature difference. A grid of temperature sensors (which may also be 
used for determining average leaving air dry bulb temperature) is 
required to measure the temperature distribution within a cross-section 
of the leaving airstream.
    c. Use an inlet and outlet air damper box when testing ducted 
systems if conducting one or both of the cyclic tests listed in sections 
3.2 and 3.6. Otherwise, install an outlet air damper box when testing 
heat pumps, both ducted and non-ducted, that cycle off the indoor fan 
during defrost cycles if no other means is available for preventing 
natural or forced convection through the indoor unit when the indoor fan 
is off. Never use an inlet damper box when testing a non-ducted system.
    2.5.1 Test set-up on the inlet side of the indoor coil: for cases 
where the inlet damper box is installed. a. Install the inlet side 
damper box as specified in section 2.5.1.1 or 2.5.1.2, whichever 
applies. Insulate or construct the ductwork between the point where the 
air damper is installed and where the connection is made to either the 
inlet plenum (section 2.5.1.1 units) or the indoor unit (section 2.5.1.2 
units) with thermal insulation that has a nominal overall resistance (R-
value) of at least 19 hr[middot]ft\2\[middot] [deg]F/Btu.
    b. Locate the grid of entering air dry-bulb temperature sensors, if 
used, at the inlet of the damper box. Locate the air sampling device, or 
the sensor used to measure the water vapor content of the inlet air, at 
a location immediately upstream of the damper box inlet.
    2.5.1.1 If the section 2.4.2 inlet plenum is installed. Install the 
inlet damper box upstream of the inlet plenum. The cross-sectional flow 
area of the damper box must be equal to or greater than the flow area of 
the inlet plenum. If needed, use an adaptor plate or a transition duct 
section to connect the damper box with the inlet plenum.
    2.5.1.2 If the section 2.4.2 inlet plenum is not installed. Install 
the damper box immediately upstream of the air inlet of the indoor unit. 
The cross-sectional dimensions of the damper box must be equal to or 
greater than the dimensions of the indoor unit inlet. If needed, use an 
adaptor plate or a short transition duct section to connect the damper 
box with the unit's air inlet. Add static pressure taps at the center of 
each face of the damper box, if rectangular, or at four evenly 
distributed locations along the circumference, if oval or round. Locate 
the pressure taps between the inlet damper and the inlet of the indoor 
unit. Make a manifold that connects the four static pressure taps.
    2.5.2 Test set-up on the inlet side of the indoor unit: for cases 
where no inlet damper box is installed. If using the section 2.4.2 inlet 
plenum and a grid of dry bulb temperature sensors, mount the grid at a 
location upstream of the static pressure taps described in section 
2.4.2, preferably at the entrance plane of the inlet plenum. If the 
section 2.4.2 inlet plenum is not used, but a grid of dry bulb 
temperature sensors is used, locate the grid approximately 6 inches 
upstream from the inlet of the indoor coil. Or, in the case of non-
ducted units having multiple indoor coils, locate a grid approximately 6 
inches upstream from the inlet of each indoor coil. Position an air 
sampling device, or the sensor used to measure the water vapor content 
of the inlet air, immediately upstream of the (each) entering air dry-
bulb temperature sensor grid. If a grid of sensors is not used, position 
the entering air sampling device (or the sensor used to measure the 
water vapor content of the inlet air) as if the grid were present.
    2.5.3 Indoor coil static pressure difference measurement. Section 
6.4.4.1 of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 
430.22) describes the method for fabricating static pressure taps. Also 
refer to Figure 2A of ASHRAE Standard 51-99/AMCA Standard 210-99 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22). Use a differential 
pressure measuring instrument that is accurate to within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.01 inches of water and has a resolution of at least 
0.01 inches of water to measure the static pressure difference between 
the indoor coil air inlet and outlet. Connect one side of the 
differential pressure instrument to the manifolded pressure taps 
installed in the outlet plenum. Connect the other side of the instrument 
to the manifolded pressure taps located in either the inlet plenum or 
incorporated within the air damper box. If an

[[Page 250]]

inlet plenum or inlet damper box are not used, leave the inlet side of 
the differential pressure instrument open to the surrounding atmosphere. 
For non-ducted systems that are tested with multiple outlet plenums, 
measure the static pressure within each outlet plenum relative to the 
surrounding atmosphere.
    2.5.4 Test set-up on the outlet side of the indoor coil. a. Install 
an interconnecting duct between the outlet plenum described in section 
2.4.1 and the airflow measuring apparatus described below in section 
2.6. The cross-sectional flow area of the interconnecting duct must be 
equal to or greater than the flow area of the outlet plenum or the 
common duct used when testing non-ducted units having multiple indoor 
coils. If needed, use adaptor plates or transition duct sections to 
allow the connections. To minimize leakage, tape joints within the 
interconnecting duct (and the outlet plenum). Construct or insulate the 
entire flow section with thermal insulation having a nominal overall 
resistance (R-value) of at least 19 hr[middot]ft\2\[middot] [deg]F/Btu.
    b. Install a grid(s) of dry-bulb temperature sensors inside the 
interconnecting duct. Also, install an air sampling device, or the 
sensor(s) used to measure the water vapor content of the outlet air, 
inside the interconnecting duct. Locate the dry-bulb temperature grid(s) 
upstream of the air sampling device (or the in-duct sensor(s) used to 
measure the water vapor content of the outlet air). Air that circulates 
through an air sampling device and past a remote water-vapor-content 
sensor(s) must be returned to the interconnecting duct at a point:
    (1) Downstream of the air sampling device;
    (2) Upstream of the outlet air damper box, if installed; and
    (3) Upstream of the section 2.6 airflow measuring apparatus.
    2.5.4.1 Outlet air damper box placement and requirements. If using 
an outlet air damper box (see section 2.5), install it within the 
interconnecting duct at a location downstream of the location where air 
from the sampling device is reintroduced or downstream of the in-duct 
sensor that measures water vapor content of the outlet air. The leakage 
rate from the combination of the outlet plenum, the closed damper, and 
the duct section that connects these two components must not exceed 20 
cubic feet per minute when a negative pressure of 1 inch of water column 
is maintained at the plenum's inlet.
    2.5.4.2 Procedures to minimize temperature maldistribution. Use 
these procedures if necessary to correct temperature maldistributions. 
Install a mixing device(s) upstream of the outlet air, dry-bulb 
temperature grid (but downstream of the outlet plenum static pressure 
taps). Use a perforated screen located between the mixing device and the 
dry-bulb temperature grid, with a maximum open area of 40 percent. One 
or both items should help to meet the maximum outlet air temperature 
distribution specified in section 3.1.8. Mixing devices are described in 
sections 6.3--6.5 of ASHRAE Standard 41.1-86 (RA 01) (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 430.22) and section 5.2.2 of ASHRAE Standard 41.2-
87 (RA 92) (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22).
    2.5.5 Dry bulb temperature measurement. a. Measure dry bulb 
temperatures as specified in sections 4, 5, 6.1-6.10, 9, 10, and 11 of 
ASHRAE Standard 41.1-86 (RA 01) (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 
430.22). The transient testing requirements cited in section 4.3 of 
ASHRAE Standard 41.1-86 (RA 01) (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 
430.22) apply if conducting a cyclic or frost accumulation test.
    b. Distribute the sensors of a dry-bulb temperature grid over the 
entire flow area. The required minimum is 9 sensors per grid.
    2.5.6 Water vapor content measurement. Determine water vapor content 
by measuring dry-bulb temperature combined with the air wet-bulb 
temperature, dew point temperature, or relative humidity. If used, 
construct and apply wet-bulb temperature sensors as specified in 
sections 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11 of ASHRAE Standard 41.1-86 (RA 01) 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22). As specified in ASHRAE 
41.1-86 (RA 01) (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22), the 
temperature sensor (wick removed) must be accurate to within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.2 [deg]F. If used, apply dew point hygrometers as 
specified in sections 5 and 8 of ASHRAE Standard 41.6-94 (RA 01) 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22). The dew point hygrometers 
must be accurate to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.4 [deg]F when 
operated at conditions that result in the evaluation of dew points above 
35 [deg]F. If used, a relative humidity (RH) meter must be accurate to 
within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.7% RH. Other means to determine the 
psychrometric state of air may be used as long as the measurement 
accuracy is equivalent to or better than the accuracy achieved from 
using a wet-bulb temperature sensor that meets the above specifications.
    2.5.7 Air damper box performance requirements. If used (see section 
2.5), the air damper box(es) must be capable of being completely opened 
or completely closed within 10 seconds for each action.
    2.6 Airflow measuring apparatus. a. Fabricate and operate an Air 
Flow Measuring Apparatus as specified in section 6.6 of ASHRAE Standard 
116-95 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22). Refer to Figure 12 
of ASHRAE Standard 51-99/AMCA Standard 210-99 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 430.22) or Figure 14 of ASHRAE Standard 41.2-87 (RA 
92) (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22) for guidance on 
placing the static pressure taps and positioning the diffusion

[[Page 251]]

baffle (settling means) relative to the chamber inlet.
    b. Connect the airflow measuring apparatus to the interconnecting 
duct section described in section 2.5.4. See sections 6.1.1, 6.1.2, and 
6.1.4, and Figures 1, 2, and 4 of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 430.22), and Figures D1, D2, and D4 of ARI Standard 
210/240-2003 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22) for 
illustrative examples of how the test apparatus may be applied within a 
complete laboratory set-up. Instead of following one of these examples, 
an alternative set-up may be used to handle the air leaving the airflow 
measuring apparatus and to supply properly conditioned air to the test 
unit's inlet. The alternative set-up, however, must not interfere with 
the prescribed means for measuring airflow rate, inlet and outlet air 
temperatures, inlet and outlet water vapor contents, and external static 
pressures, nor create abnormal conditions surrounding the test unit. 
(Note: Do not use an enclosure as described in section 6.1.3 of ASHRAE 
Standard 37-88 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22) when 
testing triple-split units.)
    2.7 Electrical voltage supply. Perform all tests at the voltage 
specified in section 6.1.3.2 of ARI Standard 210/240-2003 (incorporated 
by reference, see Sec. 430.22) for ``Standard Rating Tests.'' Measure 
the supply voltage at the terminals on the test unit using a volt meter 
that provides a reading that is accurate to within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>1.0 percent of the measured quantity.
    2.8 Electrical power and energy measurements. a. Use an integrating 
power (watt-hour) measuring system to determine the electrical energy or 
average electrical power supplied to all components of the air 
conditioner or heat pump (including auxiliary components such as 
controls, transformers, crankcase heater, integral condensate pump on 
non-ducted indoor units, etc.). The watt-hour measuring system must give 
readings that are accurate to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 percent. 
For cyclic tests, this accuracy is required during both the ON and OFF 
cycles. Use either two different scales on the same watt-hour meter or 
two separate watt-hour meters. Activate the scale or meter having the 
lower power rating within 15 seconds after beginning an OFF cycle. 
Activate the scale or meter having the higher power rating active within 
15 seconds prior to beginning an ON cycle. For ducted units tested with 
a fan installed, the ON cycle lasts from compressor ON to indoor fan 
OFF. For ducted units tested without an indoor fan installed, the ON 
cycle lasts from compressor ON to compressor OFF. For non-ducted units, 
the ON cycle lasts from indoor fan ON to indoor fan OFF. When testing 
air conditioners and heat pumps having a variable-speed compressor, 
avoid using an induction watt/watt-hour meter.
    b. When performing section 3.5 and/or 3.8 cyclic tests on non-ducted 
units, provide instrumentation to determine the average electrical power 
consumption of the indoor fan motor to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1.0 
percent. If required according to sections 3.3, 3.4, 3.7, 3.9.1, and/or 
3.10, this same instrumentation requirement applies when testing air 
conditioners and heat pumps having a variable-speed constant-air-volume-
rate indoor fan or a variable-speed, variable-air-volume-rate indoor 
fan.
    2.9 Time measurements. Make elapsed time measurements using an 
instrument that yields readings accurate to within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.2 percent.
    2.10 Test apparatus for the secondary space conditioning capacity 
measurement. For all tests, use the Indoor Air Enthalpy Method to 
measure the unit's capacity. This method uses the test set-up specified 
in sections 2.4 to 2.6. In addition, for all steady-state tests, conduct 
a second, independent measurement of capacity as described in section 
3.1.1. For split systems, use one of the following secondary measurement 
methods: Outdoor Air Enthalpy Method, Compressor Calibration Method, or 
Refrigerant Enthalpy Method. For single packaged units, use either the 
Outdoor Air Enthalpy Method or the Compressor Calibration Method as the 
secondary measurement.
    2.10.1 Outdoor Air Enthalpy Method. a. To make a secondary 
measurement of indoor space conditioning capacity using the Outdoor Air 
Enthalpy Method, do the following:
    (1) Measure the electrical power consumption of the test unit;
    (2) Measure the air-side capacity at the outdoor coil; and
    (3) Apply a heat balance on the refrigerant cycle.
    b. The test apparatus required for the Outdoor Air Enthalpy Method 
is a subset of the apparatus used for the Indoor Air Enthalpy Method. 
Required apparatus includes the following:
    (1) An outlet plenum containing static pressure taps (sections 2.4, 
2.4.1, and 2.5.3),
    (2) An airflow measuring apparatus (section 2.6),
    (3) A duct section that connects these two components and itself 
contains the instrumentation for measuring the dry-bulb temperature and 
water vapor content of the air leaving the outdoor coil (sections 2.5.4, 
2.5.5, and 2.5.6), and
    (4) On the inlet side, a sampling device and optional temperature 
grid (sections 2.5 and 2.5.2).
    c. During the preliminary tests described in sections 3.11.1 and 
3.11.1.1, measure the evaporator and condenser temperatures or 
pressures. On both the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, solder a 
thermocouple onto a return bend located at or near the midpoint of each 
coil or at points not affected by vapor

[[Page 252]]

superheat or liquid subcooling. Alternatively, if the test unit is not 
sensitive to the refrigerant charge, connect pressure gages to the 
access valves or to ports created from tapping into the suction and 
discharge lines. Use this alternative approach when testing a unit 
charged with a zeotropic refrigerant having a temperature glide in 
excess of 1 [deg]F at the specified test conditions.
    2.10.2 Compressor Calibration Method. Measure refrigerant pressures 
and temperatures to determine the evaporator superheat and the enthalpy 
of the refrigerant that enters and exits the indoor coil. Determine 
refrigerant flow rate or, when the superheat of the refrigerant leaving 
the evaporator is less than 5 [deg]F, total capacity from separate 
calibration tests conducted under identical operating conditions. When 
using this method, install instrumentation, measure refrigerant 
properties, and adjust the refrigerant charge according to section 7.4.2 
of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22). 
Use refrigerant temperature and pressure measuring instruments that meet 
the specifications given in sections 5.1.1 and 5.2 of ASHRAE Standard 
37-88 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22).
    2.10.3 Refrigerant Enthalpy Method. For this method, calculate space 
conditioning capacity by determining the refrigerant enthalpy change for 
the indoor coil and directly measuring the refrigerant flow rate. Use 
section 7.6.2 of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 430.22) for the requirements for this method, including the 
additional instrumentation requirements, and information on placing the 
flow meter and a sight glass. Use refrigerant temperature, pressure, and 
flow measuring instruments that meet the specifications given in 
sections 5.1.1, 5.2, and 5.5.1 of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 430.22).
    2.11 Measurement of test room ambient conditions. a. If using a test 
set-up where air is ducted directly from the conditioning apparatus to 
the indoor coil inlet (see Figure 2, Loop Air-Enthalpy Test Method 
Arrangement, of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 430.22)), add instrumentation to permit measurement of the indoor 
test room dry-bulb temperature.
    b. If the Outdoor Air Enthalpy Method is not used, add 
instrumentation to measure the dry-bulb temperature and the water vapor 
content of the air entering the outdoor coil. If an air sampling device 
is used, construct and apply the device as per section 6 of ASHRAE 
Standard 41.1-86 (RA 01) (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22). 
Take steps (e.g., add or re-position a lab circulating fan), as needed, 
to minimize the magnitude of the temperature distribution non-
uniformity. Position any fan in the outdoor test room while trying to 
keep air velocities in the vicinity of the test unit below 500 feet per 
minute.
    c. Measure dry bulb temperatures as specified in sections 4, 5, 6.1-
6.10, 9, 10, and 11 of ASHRAE Standard 41.1-86 (RA 01) (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 430.22). Measure water vapor content as stated 
above in section 2.5.6.
    2.12 Measurement of indoor fan speed. When required, measure fan 
speed using a revolution counter, tachometer, or stroboscope that gives 
readings accurate to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1.0 percent.
    2.13 Measurement of barometric pressure. Determine the average 
barometric pressure during each test. Use an instrument that meets the 
requirements specified in section 5.2 of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22).

                          3. Testing Procedures

    3.1 General Requirements. If, during the testing process, an 
equipment set-up adjustment is made that would alter the performance of 
the unit when conducting an already completed test, then repeat all 
tests affected by the adjustment. For cyclic tests, instead of 
maintaining an air volume rate, for each airflow nozzle, maintain the 
static pressure difference or velocity pressure during an ON period at 
the same pressure difference or velocity pressure as measured during the 
steady-state test conducted at the same test conditions.
    3.1.1 Primary and secondary test methods. For all tests, use the 
Indoor Air Enthalpy Method test apparatus to determine the unit's space 
conditioning capacity. The procedure and data collected, however, differ 
slightly depending upon whether the test is a steady-state test, a 
cyclic test, or a frost accumulation test. The following sections 
described these differences. For all steady-state tests (i.e., the A, 
A<INF>2</INF>, A<INF>1</INF>, B, B<INF>2</INF>, B<INF>1</INF>, C, 
C<INF>1</INF>, EV, F<INF>1</INF>, G<INF>1</INF>, H0<INF>1</INF>, 
H<INF>1</INF>, H1<INF>2</INF>, H1<INF>1</INF>, HI<INF>N</INF>, 
H<INF>3</INF>, H3<INF>2</INF>, and H3<INF>1</INF> Tests), in addition, 
use one of the acceptable secondary methods specified in section 2.10 to 
determine indoor space conditioning capacity. Calculate this secondary 
check of capacity according to section 3.11. The two capacity 
measurements must agree to within 6 percent to constitute a valid test. 
For this capacity comparison, use the Indoor Air Enthalpy Method 
capacity that is calculated in section 7.3 of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22) (and do not make the 
after-test fan heat adjustments described in sections 3.3, 3.4, 3.7, and 
3.10 of this Appendix). However, include the appropriate section 3.3 to 
3.5 and 3.7 to 3.10 fan heat adjustments within the Indoor Air Enthalpy 
Method capacities used for the section 4 seasonal calculations.
    3.1.2 Manufacturer-provided equipment overrides. Where needed, the 
manufacturer

[[Page 253]]

must provide a means for overriding the controls of the test unit so 
that the compressor(s) operates at the specified speed or capacity and 
the indoor fan operates at the specified speed or delivers the specified 
air volume rate.
    3.1.3 Airflow through the outdoor coil. For all tests, meet the 
requirements given in section 6.1.3.4 of ARI Standard 210/240-2003 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22) when obtaining the airflow 
through the outdoor coil.
    3.1.4 Airflow through the indoor coil.
    3.1.4.1 Cooling Certified Air Volume Rate.
    3.1.4.1.1 Cooling Certified Air Volume Rate for Ducted Units. The 
manufacturer must specify the Cooling Certified Air Volume Rate. Use 
this value as long as the following two requirements are satisfied. 
First, when conducting the A or A<INF>2</INF> Test (exclusively), the 
measured air volume rate, when divided by the measured indoor air-side 
total cooling capacity, must not exceed 37.5 cubic feet per minute of 
standard air (scfm) per 1000 Btu/h. If this ratio is exceeded, reduce 
the air volume rate until this ratio is equaled. Use this reduced air 
volume rate for all tests that call for using the Cooling Certified Air 
Volume Rate. The second requirement is as follows:
    a. For ducted units that are tested with a fixed-speed, multi-speed, 
or variable-speed variable-air-volume-rate indoor fan installed. For the 
A or A<INF>2</INF> Test (exclusively), the measured external static 
pressure must be equal to or greater than the applicable minimum 
external static pressure cited in Table 2. If the Table 2 minimum is not 
equaled or exceeded, incrementally change the set-up of the indoor fan 
(e.g., fan motor pin settings, fan motor speed) until the Table 2 
requirement is met while maintaining the same air volume rate. If the 
indoor fan set-up changes cannot provide the minimum external static, 
then reduce the air volume rate until the correct Table 2 minimum is 
equaled. For the last scenario, use the reduced air volume rate for all 
tests that require the Cooling Certified Air Volume Rate.
    b. For ducted units that are tested with a constant-air-volume-rate 
indoor fan installed. For all tests that specify the Cooling Certified 
Air Volume Rate, obtain an external static pressure as close to (but not 
less than) the applicable Table 2 value that does not cause instability 
or an automatic shutdown of the indoor blower.
    c. For ducted units that are tested without an indoor fan installed. 
For the A or A<INF>2</INF> Test, (exclusively), the pressure drop across 
the indoor coil assembly must not exceed 0.30 inches of water. If this 
pressure drop is exceeded, reduce the air volume rate until the measured 
pressure drop equals the specified maximum. Use this reduced air volume 
rate for all tests that require the Cooling Certified Air Volume Rate.

  or H12 Test conditions.
\3\ For ducted units tested without an air filter installed, increase
  the applicable tabular value by 0.08 inches of water.

    3.1.4.1.2 Cooling Certified Air Volume Rate for Non-ducted Units. 
For non-ducted units, the Cooling Certified Air Volume Rate is the air 
volume rate that results during each test when the unit is operated at 
an external static pressure of zero inches of water.
    3.1.4.2 Cooling Minimum Air Volume Rate. a. For ducted units that 
regulate the speed (as opposed to the cfm) of the indoor fan,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.002

where ``Cooling Minimum Fan Speed'' corresponds to the fan speed used 
when operating at low compressor capacity (two-capacity system), the fan 
speed used when operating at the minimum compressor speed (variable-
speed system), or the lowest fan speed used when cooling (single-speed 
compressor and a variable-speed variable-air-volume-rate indoor fan). 
For such systems, obtain the Cooling Minimum Air Volume Rate regardless 
of the external static pressure.
    b. For ducted units that regulate the air volume rate provided by 
the indoor fan, the manufacturer must specify the Cooling Minimum Air 
Volume Rate. For such systems, conduct all tests that specify the 
Cooling Minimum Air Volume Rate--(i.e., the A<INF>1</INF>, 
B<INF>1</INF>, C<INF>1</INF>, F<INF>1</INF>, and G<INF>1</INF> Tests)--
at an external static pressure that does not cause instability or

[[Page 254]]

an automatic shutdown of the indoor blower while being as close to, but 
not less than,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.003

where [Delta]P<INF>st,A</INF>2 is the applicable Table 2 minimum 
external static pressure that was targeted during the A<INF>2</INF> (and 
B<INF>2</INF>) Test.
    c. For ducted two-capacity units that are tested without an indoor 
fan installed, the Cooling Minimum Air Volume Rate is the higher of (1) 
the rate specified by the manufacturer or (2) 75 percent of the Cooling 
Certified Air Volume Rate. During the laboratory tests on a coil-only 
(fanless) unit, obtain this Cooling Minimum Air Volume Rate regardless 
of the pressure drop across the indoor coil assembly.
    d. For non-ducted units, the Cooling Minimum Air Volume Rate is the 
air volume rate that results during each test when the unit operates at 
an external static pressure of zero inches of water and at the indoor 
fan setting used at low compressor capacity (two-capacity system) or 
minimum compressor speed (variable-speed system). For units having a 
single-speed compressor and a variable-speed variable-air-volume-rate 
indoor fan, use the lowest fan setting allowed for cooling.
    3.1.4.3 Cooling Intermediate Air Volume Rate. a. For ducted units 
that regulate the speed of the indoor fan,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.004

For such units, obtain the Cooling Intermediate Air Volume Rate 
regardless of the external static pressure.
    b. For ducted units that regulate the air volume rate provided by 
the indoor fan, the manufacturer must specify the Cooling Intermediate 
Air Volume Rate. For such systems, conduct the E<INF>V</INF> Test at an 
external static pressure that does not cause instability or an automatic 
shutdown of the indoor blower while being as close to, but not less 
than,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.005

where [Delta]P<INF>st,A</INF>2 is the applicable Table 2 minimum 
external static pressure that was targeted during the A<INF>2</INF> (and 
B<INF>2</INF>) Test.
    c. For non-ducted units, the Cooling Intermediate Air Volume Rate is 
the air volume rate that results when the unit operates at an external 
static pressure of zero inches of water and at the fan speed selected by 
the controls of the unit for the E<INF>V</INF> Test conditions.
    3.1.4.4 Heating Certified Air Volume Rate.
    3.1.4.4.1 Ducted heat pumps where the Heating and Cooling Certified 
Air Volume Rates are the same. a. Use the Cooling Certified Air Volume 
Rate as the Heating Certified Air Volume Rate for:
    1. Ducted heat pumps that operate at the same indoor fan speed 
during both the A (or A<INF>2</INF>) and the H1 (or H1<INF>2</INF>) 
Tests;
    2. Ducted heat pumps that regulate fan speed to deliver the same 
constant air volume rate during both the A (or A<INF>2</INF>) and the H1 
(or H1<INF>2</INF>) Tests; and
    3. Ducted heat pumps that are tested without an indoor fan installed 
(except two-capacity northern heat pumps that are tested only at low 
capacity cooling--see 3.1.4.4.2).

b. For heat pumps that meet the above criteria ``1'' and ``3,'' no 
minimum requirements apply to the measured external or internal, 
respectively, static pressure. For heat pumps that meet the above 
criterion ``2,'' test at an external static pressure that does not cause 
instability or an automatic shutdown of the

[[Page 255]]

indoor blower while being as close to, but not less than, the same Table 
2 minimum external static pressure as was specified for the A (or 
A<INF>2</INF>) cooling mode test.
    3.1.4.4.2 Ducted heat pumps where the Heating and Cooling Certified 
Air Volume Rates are different due to indoor fan operation. a. For 
ducted heat pumps that regulate the speed (as opposed to the cfm) of the 
indoor fan,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.006

For such heat pumps, obtain the Heating Certified Air Volume Rate 
without regard to the external static pressure.
    b. For ducted heat pumps that regulate the air volume rate delivered 
by the indoor fan, the manufacturer must specify the Heating Certified 
Air Volume Rate. For such heat pumps, conduct all tests that specify the 
Heating Certified Air Volume Rate at an external static pressure that 
does not cause instability or an automatic shutdown of the indoor blower 
while being as close to, but not less than,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.007

where the Cooling Certified [Delta]P<INF>st</INF> is the applicable 
Table 2 minimum external static pressure that was specified for the A or 
A<INF>2</INF> Test.
    c. When testing ducted, two-capacity northern heat pumps (see 
Definition 1.46), use the appropriate approach of the above two cases 
for units that are tested with an indoor fan installed. For coil-only 
(fanless) northern heat pumps, the Heating Certified Air Volume Rate is 
the lesser of the rate specified by the manufacturer or 133 percent of 
the Cooling Certified Air Volume Rate. For this latter case, obtain the 
Heating Certified Air Volume Rate regardless of the pressure drop across 
the indoor coil assembly.
    3.1.4.4.3 Ducted heating-only heat pumps. The manufacturer must 
specify the Heating Certified Air Volume Rate. Use this value when the 
following two requirements are satisfied. First, when conducting the H1 
or H1<INF>2</INF> Test (exclusively), the measured air volume rate, when 
divided by the measured indoor air-side total heating capacity, must not 
exceed 37.5 cubic feet per minute of standard air (scfm) per 1000 Btu/h. 
If this ratio is exceeded, reduce the air volume rate until this ratio 
is equaled. Use this reduced air volume rate for all tests of heating-
only heat pumps that call for the Heating Certified Air Volume Rate. The 
second requirement is as follows:
    a. For heating-only heat pumps that are tested with a fixed-speed, 
multi-speed, or variable-speed variable-air-volume-rate indoor fan 
installed. For the H1 or H1<INF>2</INF> Test (exclusively), the measured 
external static pressure must be equal to or greater than the Table 2 
minimum external static pressure that applies given the heating-only 
heat pump's rated heating capacity. If the Table 2 minimum is not 
equaled or exceeded, incrementally change the set-up of the indoor fan 
until the Table 2 requirement is met while maintaining the same air 
volume rate. If the indoor fan set-up changes cannot provide the 
necessary external static pressure, then reduce the air volume rate 
until the correct Table 2 minimum is equaled. For the last scenario, use 
the reduced air volume rate for all tests that require the Heating 
Certified Air Volume Rate.
    b. For ducted heating-only heat pumps having a constant-air-volume-
rate indoor fan. For all tests that specify the Heating Certified Air 
Volume Rate, obtain an external static pressure that does not cause 
instability or an automatic shutdown of the indoor blower while being as 
close to, but not less than, the applicable Table 2 minimum.
    c. For ducted heating-only heat pumps that are tested without an 
indoor fan installed. For the H1 or H1<INF>2</INF> Test, (exclusively), 
the pressure drop across the indoor coil assembly must not exceed 0.30 
inches of water. If this pressure drop is exceeded, reduce the air 
volume rate until the measured pressure drop equals the specified 
maximum. Use this reduced air volume rate for all tests that require the 
Heating Certified Air Volume Rate.
    3.1.4.4.4 Non-ducted heat pumps, including non-ducted heating-only 
heat pumps. For non-ducted heat pumps, the Heating Certified Air Volume 
Rate is the air volume rate

[[Page 256]]

that results during each test when the unit operates at an external 
static pressure of zero inches of water.
    3.1.4.5 Heating Minimum Air Volume Rate. a. For ducted heat pumps 
that regulate the speed (as opposed to the cfm) of the indoor fan,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.008

where ``Heating Minimum Fan Speed'' corresponds to the fan speed used 
when operating at low compressor capacity (two-capacity system), the 
lowest fan speed used at any time when operating at the minimum 
compressor speed (variable-speed system), or the lowest fan speed used 
when heating (single-speed compressor and a variable-speed variable-air-
volume-rate indoor fan). For such heat pumps, obtain the Heating Minimum 
Air Volume Rate without regard to the external static pressure.
    b. For ducted heat pumps that regulate the air volume rate delivered 
by the indoor fan, the manufacturer must specify the Heating Minimum Air 
Volume Rate. For such heat pumps, conduct all tests that specify the 
Heating Minimum Air Volume Rate--(i.e., the H0<INF>1</INF>, 
H1<INF>1</INF>, H2<INF>1</INF>, and H3<INF>1</INF> Tests)--at an 
external static pressure that does not cause instability or an automatic 
shutdown of the indoor blower while being as close to, but not less 
than,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.009

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.161

is the minimum external static pressure that was targeted during the 
H1<INF>2</INF> Test.
    c. For ducted two-capacity northern heat pumps that are tested with 
an indoor fan installed, use the appropriate approach of the above two 
cases.
    d. For ducted two-capacity heat pumps that are tested without an 
indoor fan installed, use the Cooling Minimum Air Volume Rate as the 
Heating Minimum Air Volume Rate. For ducted two-capacity northern heat 
pumps that are tested without an indoor fan installed, use the Cooling 
Certified Air Volume Rate as the Heating Minimum Air Volume Rate. For 
ducted two-capacity heating-only heat pumps that are tested without an 
indoor fan installed, the Heating Minimum Air Volume Rate is the higher 
of the rate specified by the manufacturer or 75 percent of the Heating 
Certified Air Volume Rate. During the laboratory tests on a coil-only 
(fanless) unit, obtain the Heating Minimum Air Volume Rate without 
regard to the pressure drop across the indoor coil assembly.
    e. For non-ducted heat pumps, the Heating Minimum Air Volume Rate is 
the air volume rate that results during each test when the unit operates 
at an external static pressure of zero inches of water and at the indoor 
fan setting used at low compressor capacity (two-capacity system) or 
minimum compressor speed (variable-speed system). For units having a 
single-speed compressor and a variable-speed, variable-air-volume-rate 
indoor fan, use the lowest fan setting allowed for heating.
    3.1.4.6 Heating Intermediate Air Volume Rate. a. For ducted heat 
pumps that regulate the speed of the indoor fan,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.010

    For such heat pumps, obtain the Heating Intermediate Air Volume Rate 
without regard to the external static pressure.
    b. For ducted heat pumps that regulate the air volume rate delivered 
by the indoor fan, the manufacturer must specify the Heating 
Intermediate Air Volume Rate. For such

[[Page 257]]

heat pumps, conduct the H2<INF>V</INF> Test at an external static 
pressure that does not cause instability or an automatic shutdown of the 
indoor blower while being as close to, but not less than,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.011

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.162

is the minimum external static pressure that was specified for the 
H1<INF>2</INF> Test.
    c. For non-ducted heat pumps, the Heating Intermediate Air Volume 
Rate is the air volume rate that results when the heat pump operates at 
an external static pressure of zero inches of water and at the fan speed 
selected by the controls of the unit for the H2<INF>V</INF> Test 
conditions.
    3.1.4.7 Heating Nominal Air Volume Rate. Except for the noted 
changes, determine the Heating Nominal Air Volume Rate using the 
approach described in section 3.1.4.6. Required changes include 
substituting ``H1<INF>N</INF> Test'' for H2<INF>V</INF> Test'' within 
the first section 3.1.4.6 equation, substituting ``H1<INF>N</INF> Test 
[Delta]P<INF>st</INF>'' for ``H2<INF>V</INF> Test 
[Delta]P<INF>st</INF>'' in the second section 3.1.4.6 equation, 
substituting ``H1<INF>N</INF> Test'' for each ``H2<INF>V</INF> Test'', 
and substituting ``Heating Nominal Air Volume Rate'' for each ``Heating 
Intermediate Air Volume Rate.''
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.012

    3.1.5 Indoor test room requirement when the air surrounding the 
indoor unit is not supplied from the same source as the air entering the 
indoor unit. If using a test set-up where air is ducted directly from 
the air reconditioning apparatus to the indoor coil inlet (see Figure 2, 
Loop Air-Enthalpy Test Method Arrangement, of ASHRAE Standard 37-88) 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22), maintain the dry bulb 
temperature within the test room within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5.0 [deg]F 
of the applicable sections 3.2 and 3.6 dry bulb temperature test 
condition for the air entering the indoor unit.
    3.1.6 Air volume rate calculations. For all steady-state tests and 
for frost accumulation (H2, H2<INF>1</INF>, H2<INF>2</INF>, 
H2<INF>V</INF>) tests, calculate the air volume rate through the indoor 
coil as specified in sections 7.8.3.1 and 7.8.3.2 of ASHRAE Standard 37-
88 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22). When using the Outdoor 
Air Enthalpy Method, follow sections 7.8.3.1 and 7.8.3.2 to calculate 
the air volume rate through the outdoor coil. To express air volume 
rates in terms of standard air, use:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.013

where,

V<INF>s</INF> = air volume rate of standard (dry) air, (ft\3\/
min)<INF>da</INF>
V<INF>mx</INF> = air volume rate of the air-water vapor mixture, (ft\3\/
min)<INF>mx</INF>
v<INF>n</INF>[min] = specific volume of air-water vapor mixture at the 
nozzle, ft\3\ per lbm of the air-water vapor mixture
W<INF>n</INF> = humidity ratio at the nozzle, lbm of water vapor per lbm 
of dry air
0.075 = the density associated with standard (dry) air, (lbm/ft\3\)

[[Page 258]]

v<INF>n</INF> = specific volume of the dry air portion of the mixture 
evaluated at the dry-bulb temperature, vapor content, and barometric 
pressure existing at the nozzle, ft\3\ per lbm of dry air.

    3.1.7 Test sequence. When testing a ducted unit (except if a 
heating-only heat pump), conduct the A or A<INF>2</INF> Test first to 
establish the Cooling Certified Air Volume Rate. For ducted heat pumps 
where the Heating and Cooling Certified Air Volume Rates are different, 
make the first heating mode test one that requires the Heating Certified 
Air Volume Rate. For ducted heating-only heat pumps, conduct the H1 or 
H1<INF>2</INF> Test first to establish the Heating Certified Air Volume 
Rate. When conducting an optional cyclic test, always conduct it 
immediately after the steady-state test that requires the same test 
conditions. For variable-speed systems, the first test using the Cooling 
Minimum Air Volume Rate should precede the E<INF>V</INF> Test if one 
expects to adjust the indoor fan control options when preparing for the 
first Minimum Air Volume Rate test. Under the same circumstances, the 
first test using the Heating Minimum Air Volume Rate should precede the 
H2<INF>V</INF> Test. The test laboratory makes all other decisions on 
the test sequence.
    3.1.8 Requirement for the air temperature distribution leaving the 
indoor coil. For at least the first cooling mode test and the first 
heating mode test, monitor the temperature distribution of the air 
leaving the indoor coil using the grid of individual sensors described 
in sections 2.5 and 2.5.4. For the 30-minute data collection interval 
used to determine capacity, the maximum spread among the outlet dry bulb 
temperatures from any data sampling must not exceed 1.5 [deg]F. Install 
the mixing devices described in section 2.5.4.2 to minimize the 
temperature spread.
    3.1.9 Control of auxiliary resistive heating elements. Except as 
noted, disable heat pump resistance elements used for heating indoor air 
at all times, including during defrost cycles and if they are normally 
regulated by a heat comfort controller. For heat pumps equipped with a 
heat comfort controller, enable the heat pump resistance elements only 
during the below-described, short test. For single-speed heat pumps 
covered under section 3.6.1, the short test follows the H1 or, if 
conducted, the H1C Test. For two-capacity heat pumps and heat pumps 
covered under section 3.6.2, the short test follows the H1<INF>2</INF> 
Test. Set the heat comfort controller to provide the maximum supply air 
temperature. With the heat pump operating and while maintaining the 
Heating Certified Air Volume Rate, measure the temperature of the air 
leaving the indoor-side beginning 5 minutes after activating the heat 
comfort controller. Sample the outlet dry-bulb temperature at regular 
intervals that span 5 minutes or less. Collect data for 10 minutes, 
obtaining at least 3 samples. Calculate the average outlet temperature 
over the 10-minute interval, T<INF>CC</INF>.
    3.2 Cooling mode tests for different types of air conditioners and 
heat pumps.
    3.2.1 Tests for a unit having a single-speed compressor that is 
tested with a fixed-speed indoor fan installed, with a constant-air-
volume-rate indoor fan installed, or with no indoor fan installed. 
Conduct two steady-state wet coil tests, the A and B Tests. Use the two 
optional dry-coil tests, the steady-state C Test and the cyclic D Test, 
to determine the cooling mode cyclic degradation coefficient, 
C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP>. If the two optional tests are not conducted, 
assign C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP> the default value of 0.25. Table 3 
specifies test conditions for these four tests.

    3.2.2 Tests for a unit having a single-speed compressor and a 
variable-speed variable-air-volume-rate indoor fan installed.
    3.2.2.1 Indoor fan capacity modulation that correlates with the 
outdoor dry bulb temperature. Conduct four steady-state wet coil tests: 
The A<INF>2</INF>, A<INF>1</INF> , B<INF>2</INF>, and B<INF>1</INF> 
Tests. Use the two optional dry-coil tests, the steady-state 
C<INF>1</INF> Test and the cyclic D<INF>1</INF> Test, to determine the 
cooling mode cyclic degradation coefficient, C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP>. 
If the two optional tests are not conducted, assign 
C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP> the default value of 0.25. Table 4 specifies 
test conditions for these six tests.
    3.2.2.2 Indoor fan capacity modulation based on adjusting the 
sensible to total (S/T) cooling capacity ratio. The testing requirements 
are the same as specified in section 3.2.1 and Table 3. Use a Cooling 
Certified Air Volume Rate that represents a normal residential 
installation. If performed, conduct the steady-state C Test and the 
cyclic D Test with the unit operating in the same S/T capacity control 
mode as used for the B Test.

    3.2.3 Tests for a unit having a two-capacity compressor. (See 
Definition 1.45.) a. Conduct four steady-state wet coil tests: The 
A<INF>2</INF>, A<INF>1</INF>, B<INF>2</INF>, and B<INF>1</INF> Tests. 
Use the two optional dry-coil tests, the steady-state C<INF>1</INF> Test 
and the cyclic D<INF>1</INF> Test, to determine the cooling mode cyclic 
degradation coefficient, C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP>. If the two optional 
tests are not conducted, assign C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP> the default 
value of 0.25. Table 5 specifies test conditions for these six tests.
    b. For units having a variable speed indoor fan that is modulated to 
adjust the sensible to total (S/T) cooling capacity ratio, use Cooling 
Certified and Cooling Minimum Air Volume Rates that represent a normal 
residential installation. Additionally, if conducting the optional dry-
coil tests, operate the unit in the same S/T capacity control mode as 
used for the B<INF>1</INF> Test.
    c. Test two-capacity, northern heat pumps (see Definition 1.46) in 
the same way as a single speed heat pump with the unit operating 
exclusively at low compressor capacity (see section 3.2.1 and Table 3).
    d. If a two-capacity air conditioner or heat pump locks out low 
capacity operation at outdoor temperatures that are less than 95 [deg]F, 
conduct the A<INF>1</INF> Test using the outdoor temperature conditions 
listed for the F<INF>1</INF> Test in Table 6 rather than using the

    3.2.4 Tests for a unit having a variable-speed compressor. a. 
Conduct five steady-state wet coil tests: The A<INF>2</INF>, 
E<INF>V</INF>, B<INF>2</INF>, B<INF>1</INF>, and F<INF>1</INF> Tests. 
Use the two optional dry-coil tests, the steady-state G<INF>1</INF> Test 
and the cyclic I<INF>1</INF> Test, to determine the cooling mode cyclic 
degradation coefficient,C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP>. If the two optional 
tests are not conducted, assign C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP> the default

where a tolerance of plus 5 percent or the next higher inverter 
frequency step from that calculated is allowed.
    b. For units that modulate the indoor fan speed to adjust the 
sensible to total (S/T) cooling capacity ratio, use Cooling Certified, 
Cooling Intermediate, and Cooling Minimum Air Volume Rates that

    3.3 Test procedures for steady-state wet coil cooling mode tests 
(the A, A<INF>2</INF>, A<INF>1</INF>, B, B<INF>2</INF>, B<INF>1</INF>, 
E<INF>V</INF>, and F<INF>1</INF> Tests). a. For the pretest interval, 
operate the test room reconditioning apparatus and the unit to be tested 
until maintaining equilibrium conditions for at least 30 minutes at the 
specified section 3.2 test conditions. Use the exhaust fan of the 
airflow measuring apparatus and, if installed, the indoor fan of the 
test unit to obtain and then maintain the indoor air volume rate and/or 
external static pressure specified for the particular test. Continuously 
record (see Definition 1.15):
    (1) The dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the indoor coil,
    (2) The water vapor content of the air entering the indoor coil,
    (3) The dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the outdoor coil, 
and
    (4) For the section 2.2.4 cases where its control is required, the 
water vapor content of the air entering the outdoor coil.
    Refer to section 3.11 for additional requirements that depend on the 
selected secondary test method.
    b. After satisfying the pretest equilibrium requirements, make the 
measurements specified in Table 5 of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 (incorporated 
by reference, see Sec. 430.22) for the Indoor Air Enthalpy method and 
the user-selected secondary method. Except for external static pressure, 
make the Table 5 measurements at equal intervals that span 10 minutes or 
less. Measure external static pressure every 5 minutes or less. Continue 
data sampling until reaching a 30-minute period (e.g., four consecutive 
10-minute samples) where the test tolerances specified in Table 7 are 
satisfied. For those continuously recorded parameters, use the entire 
data set from the 30-minute interval to evaluate Table 7 compliance. 
Determine the average electrical power consumption of the air 
conditioner or heat pump over the same 30-minute interval.
    c. Calculate indoor-side total cooling capacity as specified in 
section 7.3.3.1 of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 430.22). Do not adjust the parameters used in calculating capacity 
for the permitted variations in test conditions. Evaluate air enthalpies 
based on the measured barometric pressure. Assign the average total 
space cooling capacity and electrical power consumption over the 30-
minute data collection interval to the variables 
Q<INF>c</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(T) and E<INF>c</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(T), 
respectively. For these two variables, replace the ``T'' with the 
nominal outdoor temperature at which the test was conducted. The 
superscript k is used only when testing multi-capacity units. Use the 
superscript k=2 to denote a test with the unit operating at high 
capacity or maximum speed, k=1 to denote low capacity or minimum speed, 
and k=v to denote the intermediate speed.
    d. For units tested without an indoor fan installed, decrease 
Q<INF>c</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(T) by
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.015

and increase E<INF>c</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(T) by,

where V<INF>s</INF> is the average measured indoor air volume rate 
expressed in units of cubic feet per minute of standard air (scfm).

    d. For air conditioners and heat pumps having a constant-air-volume-
rate indoor fan, the five additional steps listed below are required if 
the average of the measured external static pressures exceeds the 
applicable sections 3.1.4 minimum (or target) external static pressure 
([Delta]P<INF>min</INF>) by 0.03 inches of water or more.
    1. Measure the average power consumption of the indoor fan motor 
(E<INF>fan,1</INF>) and record the corresponding external static 
pressure ([Delta]P<INF>1</INF>) during or immediately following the 30-
minute interval used for determining capacity.
    2. After completing the 30-minute interval and while maintaining the 
same test conditions, adjust the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring 
apparatus until the external static pressure increases to approximately 
[Delta]P<INF>1</INF> + ([Delta]P<INF>1</INF> - [Delta]P<INF>min</INF>).
    3. After re-establishing steady readings of the fan motor power and 
external static pressure, determine average values for the indoor fan 
power (E<INF>fan,2</INF>) and the external static pressure 
([Delta]P<INF>2</INF>) by making measurements over a 5-minute interval.
    4. Approximate the average power consumption of the indoor fan motor 
at [Delta]P<INF>min</INF> using linear extrapolation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.017

    5. Increase the total space cooling capacity, 
Q<INF>c</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(T), by the quantity (E<INF>fan,1</INF> - 
E<INF>fan,min</INF>), when expressed on a Btu/h basis. Decrease the 
total electrical power, E<INF>c</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(T), by the same fan 
power difference, now expressed in watts.
    3.4 Test procedures for the optional steady-state dry coil cooling 
mode tests (the C, C<INF>1</INF>, and G<INF>1</INF> Tests). a. Except 
for the modifications noted in this section, conduct the steady-state 
dry coil cooling mode tests as specified in section 3.3 for wet coil 
tests. Prior to recording data during the steady-state dry coil test, 
operate the unit at least one hour after achieving dry coil conditions. 
Drain the drain pan and plug the drain opening. Thereafter, the drain 
pan should remain completely dry.
    b. Denote the resulting total space cooling capacity and electrical 
power derived from the test as Q<INF>ss,dry</INF> and 
E<INF>ss,dry</INF>(T). In preparing for the section 3.5 cyclic test, 
record the average indoor-side air volume rate, V, specific heat of the 
air, C<INF>p,a</INF> (expressed on dry air basis), specific volume of 
the air at the nozzles, v[min]<INF>n</INF>, humidity ratio at the 
nozzles, W<INF>n</INF>, and either pressure difference or velocity 
pressure for the flow nozzles. For units having a variable-speed indoor 
fan (that provides either a constant or variable air volume rate) that 
will or may be tested during the cyclic dry coil cooling mode test with

[[Page 263]]

the indoor fan turned off (see section 3.5), include the electrical 
power used by the indoor fan motor among the recorded parameters from 
the 30-minute test.
    3.5 Test procedures for the optional cyclic dry coil cooling mode 
tests (the D, D<INF>1</INF>, and I<INF>1</INF> Tests). a. After 
completing the steady-state dry-coil test, remove the Outdoor Air 
Enthalpy method test apparatus, if connected, and begin manual OFF/ON 
cycling of the unit's compressor. The test set-up should otherwise be 
identical to the set-up used during the steady-state dry coil test. When 
testing heat pumps, leave the reversing valve during the compressor OFF 
cycles in the same position as used for the compressor ON cycles, unless 
automatically changed by the controls of the unit. For units having a 
variable-speed indoor fan, the manufacturer has the option of electing 
at the outset whether to conduct the cyclic test with the indoor fan 
enabled or disabled. Always revert to testing with the indoor fan 
disabled if cyclic testing with the fan enabled is unsuccessful.
    b. For units having a single-speed or two-capacity compressor, cycle 
the compressor OFF for 24 minutes and then ON for 6 minutes 
([Delta][tau]<INF>cyc,dry</INF> = 0.5 hours). For units having a 
variable-speed compressor, cycle the compressor OFF for 48 minutes and 
then ON for 12 minutes ([Delta][tau]<INF>cyc,dry</INF> = 1.0 hours). 
Repeat the OFF/ON compressor cycling pattern until the test is 
completed. Allow the controls of the unit to regulate cycling of the 
outdoor fan.
    c. Sections 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 specify airflow requirements through the 
indoor coil of ducted and non-ducted systems, respectively. In all 
cases, use the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus (covered 
under section 2.6) along with the indoor fan of the unit, if installed 
and operating, to approximate a step response in the indoor coil 
airflow. Regulate the exhaust fan to quickly obtain and then maintain 
the flow nozzle static pressure difference or velocity pressure at the 
same value as was measured during the steady-state dry coil test. The 
pressure difference or velocity pressure should be within 2 percent of 
the value from the steady-state dry coil test within 15 seconds after 
airflow initiation. For units having a variable-speed indoor fan that 
ramps when cycling on and/or off, use the exhaust fan of the airflow 
measuring apparatus to impose a step response that begins at the 
initiation of ramp up and ends at the termination of ramp down.
    d. For units having a variable-speed indoor fan, conduct the cyclic 
dry coil test using the pull-thru approach described below if any of the 
following occur when testing with the fan operating:
    (1) The test unit automatically cycles off;
    (2) Its blower motor reverses; or
    (3) The unit operates for more than 30 seconds at an external static 
pressure that is 0.1 inches of water or more higher than the value 
measured during the prior steady-state test.
    For the pull-thru approach, disable the indoor fan and use the 
exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus to generate the specified 
flow nozzles static pressure difference or velocity pressure. If the 
exhaust fan cannot deliver the required pressure difference because of 
resistance created by the unpowered blower, temporarily remove the 
blower.
    e. After completing a minimum of two complete compressor OFF/ON 
cycles, determine the overall cooling delivered and total electrical 
energy consumption during any subsequent data collection interval where 
the test tolerances given in Table 8 are satisfied. If available, use 
electric resistance heaters (see section 2.1) to minimize the variation 
in the inlet air temperature.
    f. With regard to the Table 8 parameters, continuously record the 
dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the indoor and outdoor coils 
during periods when air flows through the respective coils. Sample the 
water vapor content of the indoor coil inlet air at least every 2 
minutes during periods when air flows through the coil. Record external 
static pressure and the air volume rate indicator (either nozzle 
pressure difference or velocity pressure) at least every minute during 
the interval that air flows through the indoor coil. (These regular 
measurements of the airflow rate indicator are in addition to the 
required measurement at 15 seconds after flow initiation.) Sample the 
electrical voltage at least every 2 minutes beginning 30 seconds after 
compressor start-up. Continue until the compressor, the outdoor fan, and 
the indoor fan (if it is installed and operating) cycle off.
    g. For ducted units, continuously record the dry-bulb temperature of 
the air entering (as noted above) and leaving the indoor coil. Or if 
using a thermopile, continuously record the difference between these two 
temperatures during the interval that air flows through the indoor coil. 
For non-ducted units, make the same dry-bulb temperature measurements 
beginning when the compressor cycles on and ending when indoor coil 
airflow ceases.
    h. Integrate the electrical power over complete cycles of length 
[Delta][tau]<INF>cyc,dry</INF>. For ducted units tested with an indoor 
fan installed and operating, integrate electrical power from indoor fan 
OFF to indoor fan OFF. For all other ducted units and for non-ducted 
units, integrate electrical power from compressor OFF to compressor OFF. 
(Some cyclic tests will use the same data collection intervals to 
determine the electrical energy and the total space cooling. For other 
units, terminate data collection used to determine the electrical energy 
before terminating data collection used to determine total space 
cooling.)

W<INF>n</INF> are the values recorded during the section 3.4 dry coil

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.019

T<INF>al</INF>([tau]) = dry bulb temperature of the air entering the 
indoor coil at time [tau], [deg]F.
T<INF>a2</INF>([tau]) = dry bulb temperature of the air leaving the 
indoor coil at time [tau], [deg]F.
[tau]<INF>1</INF> = for ducted units, the elapsed time when airflow is 
initiated through the indoor coil; for non-ducted units, the elapsed 
time when the compressor is cycled on, hr.
[tau]<INF>2</INF> = the elapsed time when indoor coil airflow ceases, 
hr.

    3.5.1 Procedures when testing ducted systems. The automatic controls 
that are normally installed with the test unit must govern the OFF/ON 
cycling of the air moving equipment on the indoor side (exhaust fan of 
the airflow measuring apparatus and, if installed, the indoor fan of the 
test unit). For example, for ducted units tested without an indoor fan 
installed but rated based on using a fan time delay relay, control the 
indoor coil airflow according to the rated ON and/or OFF delays provided 
by the relay. For ducted units having a variable-speed indoor fan that 
has been disabled (and possibly removed), start and stop the indoor 
airflow at the same instances as if the fan were enabled. For all other 
ducted units tested without an indoor fan installed, cycle the indoor 
coil airflow in unison with the cycling of the compressor. Close air 
dampers on the inlet (section 2.5.1) and outlet side (sections 2.5 and 
2.5.4) during the OFF period. Airflow through the indoor coil should 
stop within 3 seconds after the automatic controls of the test unit (act 
to) de-energize the indoor fan. For ducted units tested without an 
indoor fan installed (excluding the special case where a variable-speed 
fan is temporarily removed), increase e<INF>cyc,dry</INF> by the 
quantity,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.020

and decrease q<INF>cyc,dry</INF> by,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.021

where V<INF>s</INF> is the average indoor air volume rate from the 
section 3.4 dry coil steady-state test and is expressed in units of 
cubic feet per minute of standard air (scfm). For units having a 
variable-speed indoor fan that is disabled during the cyclic test, 
increase e<INF>cyc,dry</INF> and decrease q<INF>cyc,dry</INF> based on:

    a. The product of [[tau]<INF>2 - [tau]1</INF>] and the indoor fan 
power measured during or following the dry coil steady-state test; or,
    b. The following algorithm if the indoor fan ramps its speed when 
cycling.
    1. Measure the electrical power consumed by the variable-speed 
indoor fan at a minimum of three operating conditions: at the speed/air 
volume rate/external static pressure that was measured during the 
steady-state test, at operating conditions associated with the midpoint 
of the ramp-up interval, and at conditions associated with the midpoint 
of the ramp-down interval. For these measurements, the tolerances on the 
airflow volume or the external static pressure are the same as required 
for the section 3.4 steady-state test.
    2. For each case, determine the fan power from measurements made 
over a minimum of 5 minutes.
    3. Approximate the electrical energy consumption of the indoor fan 
if it had operated during the cyclic test using all three power 
measurements. Assume a linear profile during the ramp intervals. The 
manufacturer

[[Page 265]]

must provide the durations of the ramp-up and ramp-down intervals. If a 
manufacturer-supplied ramp interval exceeds 45 seconds, use a 45-second 
ramp interval nonetheless when estimating the fan energy.
    The manufacturer is allowed to choose option a, and forego the extra 
testing burden of option b, even if the unit ramps indoor fan speed when 
cycling.
    3.5.2 Procedures when testing non-ducted systems. Do not use air 
dampers when conducting cyclic tests on non-ducted units. Until the last 
OFF/ON compressor cycle, airflow through the indoor coil must cycle off 
and on in unison with the compressor. For the last OFF/ON compressor 
cycle--the one used to determine e<INF>cyc,dry</INF> and 
q<INF>cyc,dry</INF>--use the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring 
apparatus and the indoor fan of the test unit to have indoor airflow 
start 3 minutes prior to compressor cut-on and end three minutes after 
compressor cutoff. Subtract the electrical energy used by the indoor fan 
during the 3 minutes prior to compressor cut-on from the integrated 
electrical energy, e<INF>cyc,dry</INF>. Add the electrical energy used 
by the indoor fan during the 3 minutes after compressor cutoff to the 
integrated cooling capacity, q<INF>cyc,dry</INF>. For the case where the 
non-ducted unit uses a variable-speed indoor fan which is disabled 
during the cyclic test, correct e<INF>cyc,dry</INF> and 
q<INF>cyc,dry</INF> using the same approach as prescribed in section 
3.5.1 for ducted units having a disabled variable-speed indoor fan.
    3.5.3 Cooling mode cyclic degradation coefficient calculation. Use 
two optional dry-coil tests to determine the cooling mode cyclic 
degradation coefficient, C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP>. If the two optional 
tests are not conducted, assign C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP> the default 
value of 0.25. Evaluate C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP> using the above 
results and those from the section 3.4 dry coil steady-state test.

heating-only heat pumps.
    3.6.1 Tests for a heat pump having a single-speed compressor that is 
tested with a fixed speed indoor fan installed, with a constant-air-
volume-rate indoor fan installed, or with no indoor fan installed. 
Conduct three tests: The High Temperature (H1) Test, the Frost 
Accumulation (H2) Test, and the Low Temperature (H3) Test. Conduct the 
optional High Temperature Cyclic (H1C) Test to determine the heating 
mode cyclic degradation coefficient, C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP>. If this 
optional test is not conducted, assign C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> the 
default value of 0.25. Test conditions for these four tests are 
specified in Table 9.

temperature. Conduct five tests: two High Temperature Tests 
(H1<INF>2</INF> and H1<INF>1</INF>), one Frost Accumulation Test 
(H2<INF>2</INF>), and two Low Temperature Tests (H3<INF>2</INF> and

    3.6.3 Tests for a heat pump having a two-capacity compressor (see 
Definition 1.45), including two-capacity, northern heat pumps (see 
Definition 1.46). a. Conduct one Maximum Temperature Test 
(H0<INF>1</INF>), two High Temperature Tests (H1<INF>2</INF> and 
H1<INF>1</INF>), one Frost Accumulation Test (H2<INF>2</INF>), and one 
Low Temperature Test (H3<INF>2</INF>). Conduct an additional Frost 
Accumulation Test (H2<INF>1</INF>) and Low Temperature Test 
(H3<INF>1</INF>) if both of the following conditions exist:
    1. Knowledge of the heat pump's capacity and electrical power at low 
compressor capacity for outdoor temperatures of 37 [deg]F and less is 
needed to complete the section 4.2.3 seasonal performance calculations, 
and

[[Page 267]]

    2. The heat pump's controls allow low capacity operation at outdoor 
temperatures of 37 [deg]F and less.
    b. Conduct the optional Maximum Temperature Cyclic Test 
(H0C<INF>1</INF>) to determine the heating mode cyclic degradation 
coefficient, C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP>. If this optional test is not

    3.6.4 Tests for a heat pump having a variable-speed compressor. a. 
Conduct one Maximum Temperature Test (H0<INF>1</INF>), two High 
Temperature Tests (H1<INF>2</INF> and H1<INF>1</INF>), one Frost 
Accumulation Test (H2<INF>V</INF>), and one Low Temperature Test 
(H3<INF>2</INF>). Conducting one or both of the following tests is 
optional: An additional High Temperature Test (H1<INF>N</INF> ) and an 
additional Frost Accumulation Test (H2<INF>2</INF>). Conduct the 
optional Maximum Temperature Cyclic (H0C<INF>1</INF>) Test to determine 
the heating mode cyclic degradation coefficient, 
C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP>. If this optional test is not conducted, 
assign C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> the default value of 0.25. Table 12 
specifies test conditions for these eight tests. Determine the 
intermediate compressor speed cited in Table 12 using the heating mode 
maximum and minimum compressors speeds and:

where a tolerance of plus 5 percent or the next higher inverter 
frequency step from that calculated is allowed. If the H2<INF>2</INF> 
Test is not done, use the following equations to approximate the 
capacity and electrical power at the H2<INF>2</INF> test conditions:

    b. Determine the quantities Q<INF>h</INF><SUP>k=2</SUP>(47) and from 
E<INF>h</INF><SUP>k=2</SUP>(47) from the H1<INF>2</INF> Test and 
evaluate them according to section 3.7. Determine the quantities 
Q<INF>h</INF><SUP>k=2</SUP>(17) and E<INF>h</INF><SUP>k=2</SUP>(17) from 
the H3<INF>2</INF> Test and evaluate them according to section 3.10. For 
heat pumps where the heating mode maximum compressor speed exceeds its 
cooling mode maximum compressor speed, conduct the H1<INF>N</INF> Test 
if the manufacturer requests it. If the H1<INF>N</INF> Test is done, 
operate the heat pump's compressor at the same speed as the speed used 
for the cooling mode A<INF>2</INF> Test. Refer to the last sentence of 
section 4.2 to see how the results of the H1<INF>N</INF> Test may be 
used in calculating the heating seasonal performance factor.

    3.6.5 Additional test for a heat pump having a heat comfort 
controller. Test any heat pump that has a heat comfort controller (see 
Definition 1.28) according to section 3.6.1, 3.6.2, or 3.6.3, whichever 
applies, with the heat comfort controller disabled. Additionally, 
conduct the abbreviated test described in section 3.1.9 with the heat 
comfort controller active to determine the system's maximum supply air 
temperature. (Note: heat pumps having a variable speed compressor and a 
heat comfort controller are not covered in the test procedure at this 
time.)
    3.7 Test procedures for steady-state Maximum Temperature and High 
Temperature heating mode tests (the H0<INF>1</INF>, H1, H1<INF>2</INF>, 
H1<INF>1</INF>, and H1<INF>N</INF> Tests). a. For the pretest interval, 
operate the test room reconditioning apparatus and the heat pump until 
equilibrium conditions are maintained for at least 30 minutes at the 
specified section 3.6 test conditions. Use the exhaust fan of the 
airflow measuring apparatus and, if installed, the indoor fan of the 
heat pump to obtain and then maintain the indoor air volume rate and/or 
the external static pressure specified for the particular test. 
Continuously record the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the 
indoor coil, and the dry-bulb temperature and water vapor content of the 
air entering the outdoor coil. Refer to section 3.11 for additional 
requirements that depend on the selected secondary test method. After 
satisfying the pretest equilibrium requirements, make the measurements 
specified in Table 5 of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 430.22) for the Indoor Air Enthalpy method and the 
user-selected secondary method. Except for external static pressure, 
make the Table 5 measurements at equal intervals that span 10 minutes or 
less. Measure external static pressure every 5 minutes or less. Continue 
data sampling until a 30-minute period (e.g., four consecutive 10-minute 
samples) is reached where the test tolerances specified in Table 13 are 
satisfied. For those continuously recorded parameters, use the entire 
data set for the 30-minute interval when evaluating Table 13 compliance. 
Determine the average electrical power consumption of the heat pump over 
the same 30-minute interval.

    b. Calculate indoor-side total heating capacity as specified in 
section 7.3.4.1 of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 430.22). Do not adjust the parameters used in calculating capacity 
for the permitted variations in test conditions. Assign the average 
space heating capacity and electrical power over the 30-minute data 
collection interval to the variables Q<INF>h</INF><SUP>k</SUP> and 
E<INF>h</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(T) respectively. The ``T'' and superscripted 
``k'' are the same as described in section 3.3. Additionally, for the 
heating mode, use the superscript to denote results from the optional 
H1<INF>N</INF> Test, if conducted.
    c. For heat pumps tested without an indoor fan installed, increase 
Q<INF>h</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(T) by
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.030

and increase E<INF>h</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(T) by,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.031

where V<INF>s</INF> is the average measured indoor air volume rate 
expressed in units of cubic feet per minute of standard air (scfm). 
During the 30-minute data collection interval of a High Temperature 
Test, pay attention to preventing a defrost cycle. Prior to this time, 
allow the heat pump to perform a defrost cycle if automatically 
initiated by its own controls. As in all cases, wait for the heat pump's 
defrost controls to automatically terminate the defrost cycle. Heat 
pumps that undergo a defrost should operate in the heating mode for at 
least 10 minutes after defrost termination prior to beginning the 30-
minute data collection interval. For some heat pumps, frost may 
accumulate on the outdoor coil during a High Temperature test. If the 
indoor coil leaving air temperature or the difference between the 
leaving and entering air temperatures decreases by more than 1.5 [deg]F 
over the 30-minute data collection interval, then do not use the 
collected data to determine capacity. Instead, initiate a defrost cycle. 
Begin collecting data no sooner than 10 minutes after defrost 
termination. Collect 30 minutes of new data during which the Table 13 
test tolerances are satisfied. In this case, use only the results from 
the second 30-minute data collection interval to evaluate 
Q<INF>h</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(47) and E<INF>h</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(47).
    d. If conducting the optional cyclic heating mode test, which is 
described in section 3.8, record the average indoor-side air volume 
rate, V, specific heat of the air, C<INF>p,a</INF> (expressed on dry air 
basis), specific volume of the air at the nozzles, v<INF>n</INF>[min] 
(or v<INF>n</INF>), humidity ratio at the nozzles, W<INF>n</INF>, and 
either pressure difference or velocity pressure for the flow nozzles. If 
either or both of the below criteria apply, determine the average, 
steady-state, electrical power consumption of the indoor fan motor 
(E<INF>fan,1</INF>):
    1. The section 3.8 cyclic test will be conducted and the heat pump 
has a variable-speed indoor fan that is expected to be disabled during 
the cyclic test; or
    2. The heat pump has a (variable-speed) constant-air volume-rate 
indoor fan and during the steady-state test the average external static 
pressure ([Delta]P<INF>1</INF>) exceeds the applicable section 3.1.4.4 
minimum (or targeted) external static pressure ([Delta]P<INF>min</INF>) 
by 0.03 inches of water or more.
    Determine E<INF>fan,1</INF> by making measurements during the 30-
minute data collection interval, or immediately following the test and 
prior to changing the test conditions. When the above ``2'' criteria 
applies, conduct the following four steps after determining 
E<INF>fan,1</INF> (which corresponds to [Delta]P<INF>1</INF>):
    i. While maintaining the same test conditions, adjust the exhaust 
fan of the airflow measuring apparatus until the external static 
pressure increases to approximately [Delta]P<INF>1</INF> + 
([Delta]P<INF>1</INF> - [Delta]P<INF>min</INF>).
    ii. After re-establishing steady readings for fan motor power and 
external static pressure, determine average values for the indoor fan 
power (E<INF>fan,2</INF>) and the external static pressure 
([Delta]P<INF>2</INF>) by making measurements over a 5-minute interval.
    iii. Approximate the average power consumption of the indoor fan 
motor if the 30-minute test had been conducted at [Delta]P<INF>min</INF> 
using linear extrapolation:

[[Page 270]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.032

    iv. Decrease the total space heating capacity, 
Q<INF>h</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(T), by the quantity (E<INF>fan,1</INF> - 
E<INF>fan,min</INF>), when expressed on a Btu/h basis. Decrease the 
total electrical power, E<INF>h</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(T) by the same fan 
power difference, now expressed in watts.
    3.8 Test procedures for the optional cyclic heating mode tests (the 
H0C<INF>1</INF>, H1C, and H1C<INF>1</INF> Tests). a. Except as noted 
below, conduct the cyclic heating mode test as specified in section 3.5. 
As adapted to the heating mode, replace section 3.5 references to ``the 
steady-state dry coil test'' with ``the heating mode steady-state test 
conducted at the same test conditions as the cyclic heating mode test.'' 
Use the test tolerances in Table 14 rather than Table 8. Record the 
outdoor coil entering wet-bulb temperature according to the requirements 
given in section 3.5 for the outdoor coil entering dry-bulb temperature. 
Drop the subscript ``dry'' used in variables cited in section 3.5 when 
referring to quantities from the cyclic heating mode test. Determine the 
total space heating delivered during the cyclic heating test, 
q<INF>cyc</INF>, as specified in section 3.5 except for making the 
following changes:
    (1) When evaluating Equation 3.5-1, use the values of V, 
C<INF>p,a</INF>,v<INF>n</INF>[min], (or v<INF>n</INF>), and 
W<INF>n</INF> that were recorded during the section 3.7 steady-state 
test conducted at the same test conditions.
    (2) Calculate [Gamma] using,
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.033
    
    b. For ducted heat pumps tested without an indoor fan installed 
(excluding the special case where a variable-speed fan is temporarily 
removed), increase q<INF>cyc</INF> by the amount calculated using 
Equation 3.5-3. Additionally, increase e<INF>cyc</INF> by the amount 
calculated using Equation 3.5-2. In making these calculations, use the 
average indoor air volume rate (V<INF>s</INF>) determined from the 
section 3.7 steady-state heating mode test conducted at the same test 
conditions.
    c. For non-ducted heat pumps, subtract the electrical energy used by 
the indoor fan during the 3 minutes after compressor cutoff from the 
non-ducted heat pump's integrated heating capacity, q<INF>cyc</INF>.
    d. If a heat pump defrost cycle is manually or automatically 
initiated immediately prior to or during the OFF/ON cycling, operate the 
heat pump continuously until 10 minutes after defrost termination. After 
that, begin cycling the heat pump immediately or delay until the 
specified test conditions have been re-established. Pay attention to 
preventing defrosts after beginning the cycling process. For heat pumps 
that cycle off the indoor fan during a defrost cycle, make no effort 
here to restrict the air movement through the indoor coil while the fan 
is off. Resume the OFF/ON cycling while conducting a minimum of two 
complete compressor OFF/ON cycles before determining q<INF>cyc</INF> and 
e<INF>cyc</INF>.
    3.8.1 Heating mode cyclic degradation coefficient calculation. Use 
the results from the optional cyclic test and the required steady-state 
test that were conducted at the same test conditions to determine the 
heating mode cyclic degradation coefficient, C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP>. 
If the optional test is not conducted, assign C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> 
the default value of 0.25.

    3.9 Test procedures for Frost Accumulation heating mode tests (the 
H2, H2<INF>2</INF>, H2<INF>V</INF>, and H2<INF>1</INF> Tests). a. 
Confirm that the defrost controls of the heat pump are set as specified 
in section 2.2.1. Operate the test room reconditioning apparatus and the 
heat pump for at least 30 minutes at the specified section 3.6 test 
conditions before starting the ``preliminary'' test period. The 
preliminary test period must immediately precede the ``official'' test 
period, which is the heating and defrost interval over which data are 
collected for evaluating average space heating capacity and average 
electrical power consumption.
    b. For heat pumps containing defrost controls which are likely to 
cause defrosts at intervals less than one hour, the preliminary test 
period starts at the termination of an automatic defrost cycle and ends 
at the termination of the next occurring automatic defrost cycle. For 
heat pumps containing defrost controls which are likely to cause 
defrosts at intervals exceeding one hour, the preliminary test period 
must consist of a heating interval lasting at least one hour followed by 
a defrost cycle that is either manually or automatically initiated. In 
all cases, the heat pump's own controls must govern when a defrost cycle 
terminates.
    c. The official test period begins when the preliminary test period 
ends, at defrost termination. The official test period ends at the 
termination of the next occurring automatic defrost cycle. When testing 
a heat pump that uses a time-adaptive defrost control system (see 
Definition 1.42), however, manually initiate the defrost cycle that ends 
the official test period at the instant indicated by instructions 
provided by the manufacturer. If the heat pump has not undergone a 
defrost after 12 hours, immediately conclude the test and use the 
results from the full 12-hour period to calculate the average space 
heating capacity and average electrical power consumption. For heat 
pumps that turn the indoor fan off during the defrost cycle, take steps 
to cease forced airflow through the indoor coil and block the outlet 
duct whenever the heat pump's controls cycle off the indoor fan. If it 
is installed, use the outlet damper box described in section 2.5.4.1 to 
affect the blocked outlet duct.
    d. Defrost termination occurs when the controls of the heat pump 
actuate the first change in converting from defrost operation to normal 
heating operation. Defrost initiation occurs when the controls of the 
heat pump first alter its normal heating operation in order to eliminate 
possible accumulations of frost on the outdoor coil.
    e. To constitute a valid Frost Accumulation test, satisfy the test 
tolerances specified in Table 15 during both the preliminary and 
official test periods. As noted in Table 15, test operating tolerances 
are specified for two sub-intervals: (1) When heating, except for the 
first 10 minutes after the termination of a defrost cycle (Sub-interval 
H, as described in Table 15) and (2) when defrosting, plus these same 
first 10 minutes after defrost termination (Sub-interval D, as described 
in Table 15). Evaluate compliance with Table 15 test condition 
tolerances and the majority of the test operating tolerances using the 
averages from measurements recorded only during Sub-interval H. 
Continuously record the dry bulb temperature of the air entering the 
indoor coil, and the dry bulb temperature and water vapor content of the 
air entering the outdoor coil. Sample the remaining parameters listed in 
Table 15 at equal intervals that span 10 minutes or less.
    f. For the official test period, collect and use the following data 
to calculate average space heating capacity and electrical power. During 
heating and defrosting intervals when the controls of the heat pump have 
the indoor fan on, continuously record the dry-bulb temperature of the 
air entering (as noted above) and leaving the indoor coil. If using a 
thermopile, continuously record the difference between the leaving and 
entering dry-bulb temperatures during the interval(s) that air flows 
through the indoor coil. For heat pumps tested without an indoor fan

    3.9.1 Average space heating capacity and electrical power 
calculations. a. Evaluate average space heating capacity, 
Q<INF>h</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(35), when expressed in units of Btu per hour, 
using:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.038

where,

V = the average indoor air volume rate measured during Sub-interval H, 
cfm.

pressure specific heat of the air-water vapor mixture that flows through 
the indoor coil and is expressed on a dry air basis, Btu / 
lbm<INF>da</INF> [middot] [deg]F.
v<INF>n</INF>[min] = specific volume of the air-water vapor mixture at 
the nozzle, ft\3\ / lbm<INF>mx</INF>.
W<INF>n</INF> = humidity ratio of the air-water vapor mixture at the 
nozzle, lbm of water vapor per lbm of dry air.
[Delta][tau]<INF>FR</INF> = [tau]<INF>2</INF> - [tau]<INF>1</INF>, the 
elapsed time from defrost termination to defrost termination, hr.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.039

T<INF>al</INF>([tau]) = dry bulb temperature of the air entering the 
indoor coil at elapsed time [tau], [deg]F; only recorded when indoor 
coil airflow occurs; assigned the value of zero during periods (if any) 
where the indoor fan cycles off.
T<INF>a2</INF>([tau]) = dry bulb temperature of the air leaving the 
indoor coil at elapsed time [tau], [deg]F; only recorded when indoor 
coil airflow occurs; assigned the value of zero during periods (if any) 
where the indoor fan cycles off.
[tau]<INF>1</INF> = the elapsed time when the defrost termination occurs 
that begins the official test period, hr.
[tau]<INF>2</INF> = the elapsed time when the next automatically 
occurring defrost termination occurs, thus ending the official test 
period, hr.
v<INF>n</INF> = specific volume of the dry air portion of the mixture 
evaluated at the dry-bulb temperature, vapor content, and barometric 
pressure existing at the nozzle, ft\3\ per lbm of dry air.
    b. Evaluate average electrical power, E<INF>h</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(35), 
when expressed in units of watts, using:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.040

    For heat pumps tested without an indoor fan installed, increase 
Q<INF>h</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(35) by,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.041

and increase E<INF>h</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(35) by,

[[Page 273]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.042

where V<INF>s</INF> is the average indoor air volume rate measured 
during the Frost Accumulation heating mode test and is expressed in 
units of cubic feet per minute of standard air (scfm).
    c. For heat pumps having a constant-air-volume-rate indoor fan, the 
five additional steps listed below are required if the average of the 
external static pressures measured during sub-Interval H exceeds the 
applicable section 3.1.4.4, 3.1.4.5, or 3.1.4.6 minimum (or targeted) 
external static pressure ([Delta]P<INF>min</INF>) by 0.03 inches of 
water or more:
    1. Measure the average power consumption of the indoor fan motor 
(E<INF>fan,1</INF>) and record the corresponding external static 
pressure ([Delta]P<INF>1</INF>) during or immediately following the 
Frost Accumulation heating mode test. Make the measurement at a time 
when the heat pump is heating, except for the first 10 minutes after the 
termination of a defrost cycle.
    2. After the Frost Accumulation heating mode test is completed and 
while maintaining the same test conditions, adjust the exhaust fan of 
the airflow measuring apparatus until the external static pressure 
increases to approximately [Delta]P<INF>1</INF> + ([Delta]P<INF>1</INF> 
- [Delta]P<INF>min</INF>).
    3. After re-establishing steady readings for the fan motor power and 
external static pressure, determine average values for the indoor fan 
power (E<INF>fan,2</INF>) and the external static pressure 
([Delta]P<INF>2</INF>) by making measurements over a 5-minute interval.
    4. Approximate the average power consumption of the indoor fan motor 
had the Frost Accumulation heating mode test been conducted at 
[Delta]P<INF>min</INF> using linear extrapolation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.043

    5. Decrease the total heating capacity, 
Q<INF>h</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(35), by the quantity [(E<INF>fan,1</INF> - 
E<INF>fan,min</INF>)[middot] ([Delta][tau] <INF>a</INF>/[Delta][tau] 
<INF>FR</INF>], when expressed on a Btu/h basis. Decrease the total 
electrical power, E<INF>h</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(35), by the same quantity, 
now expressed in watts.
    3.9.2 Demand defrost credit. a. Assign the demand defrost credit, 
F<INF>def</INF>, that is used in section 4.2 to the value of 1 in all 
cases except for heat pumps having a demand-defrost control system 
(Definition 1.21). For such qualifying heat pumps, evaluate 
F<INF>def</INF> using,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.044

where,
[Delta][tau]<INF>def</INF> = the time between defrost terminations (in 
hours) or 1.5, whichever is greater.
[Delta][tau]<INF>max</INF> = maximum time between defrosts as allowed by 
the controls (in hours) or 12, whichever is less.
    b. For two-capacity heat pumps and for section 3.6.2 units, evaluate 
the above equation using the [Delta][tau]<INF>def</INF> that applies 
based on the Frost Accumulation Test conducted at high capacity and/or 
at the Heating Certified Air Volume Rate. For variable-speed heat pumps, 
evaluate [Delta][tau]<INF>def</INF> based on the required Frost 
Accumulation Test conducted at the intermediate compressor speed.
    3.10 Test procedures for steady-state Low Temperature heating mode 
tests (the H3, H3<INF>2</INF>, and H3<INF>1</INF> Tests). Except for the 
modifications noted in this section, conduct the Low Temperature heating 
mode test using the same approach as specified in section 3.7 for the 
Maximum and High Temperature tests. After satisfying the section 3.7 
requirements for the pretest interval but before beginning to collect 
data to determine Q<INF>h</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(17) and 
E<INF>h</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(17), conduct a defrost cycle. This defrost 
cycle may be manually or automatically initiated. The defrost sequence 
must be terminated by the action of the heat pump's defrost controls. 
Begin the 30-minute data collection interval described in section 3.7, 
from which Q<INF>h</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(17) and 
E<INF>h</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(17) are determined, no sooner than 10 minutes 
after defrost termination. Defrosts should be prevented over the 30-
minute data collection interval.
    3.11 Additional requirements for the secondary test methods. Prior 
to evaluating if the energy balance specified in section 3.1.1 is 
obtained, make an adjustment to account for the energy loss within the 
air duct that connects the indoor coil and the location where the outlet 
dry-bulb temperature is measured. If using the Outdoor Air Enthalpy 
Method, make an adjustment to account for the energy loss within the air 
duct that connects the outdoor coil and the location where the outlet 
temperature is measured. In all cases, apply the correction to the 
indoor space conditioning capacity that is determined using the 
secondary test method.
    3.11.1 If using the Outdoor Air Enthalpy Method as the secondary 
test method. During the ``official'' test, the outdoor air-side test 
apparatus described in section 2.10.1 is connected to the outdoor unit. 
To help compensate for any effect that the addition of

[[Page 274]]

this test apparatus may have on the unit's performance, conduct a 
``preliminary'' test where the outdoor air-side test apparatus is 
disconnected. Conduct a preliminary test prior to the first section 3.2 
steady-state cooling mode test and prior to the first section 3.6 
steady-state heating mode test. No other preliminary tests are required 
so long as the unit operates the outdoor fan during all cooling mode 
steady-state tests at the same speed and all heating mode steady-state 
tests at the same speed. If using more than one outdoor fan speed for 
the cooling mode steady-state tests, however, conduct a preliminary test 
prior to each cooling mode test where a different fan speed is first 
used. This same requirement applies for the heating mode tests.
    3.11.1.1 If a preliminary test precedes the official test. a. The 
test conditions for the preliminary test are the same as specified for 
the official test. Connect the indoor air-side test apparatus to the 
indoor coil; disconnect the outdoor air-side test apparatus. Allow the 
test room reconditioning apparatus and the unit being tested to operate 
for at least one hour. After attaining equilibrium conditions, measure 
the following quantities at equal intervals that span 10 minutes or 
less:
    1. The section 2.10.1 evaporator and condenser temperatures or 
pressures;
    2. Parameters required according to the Indoor Air Enthalpy Method.
    Continue these measurements until a 30-minute period (e.g., four 
consecutive 10-minute samples) is obtained where the Table 7 or Table 
13, whichever applies, test tolerances are satisfied.
    b. After collecting 30 minutes of steady-state data, reconnect the 
outdoor air-side test apparatus to the unit. Adjust the exhaust fan of 
the outdoor airflow measuring apparatus until averages for the 
evaporator and condenser temperatures, or the saturated temperatures 
corresponding to the measured pressures, agree within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 [deg]F of the averages achieved when the outdoor 
air-side test apparatus was disconnected. Calculate the averages for the 
reconnected case using five or more consecutive readings taken at one 
minute intervals. Make these consecutive readings after re-establishing 
equilibrium conditions and before initiating the official test.
    3.11.1.2 If a preliminary test does not precede the official test. 
Connect the outdoor-side test apparatus to the unit. Adjust the exhaust 
fan of the outdoor airflow measuring apparatus to achieve the same 
external static pressure as measured during the prior preliminary test 
conducted with the unit operating in the same cooling or heating mode at 
the same outdoor fan speed.
    3.11.1.3 Official test. a. Continue (preliminary test was conducted) 
or begin (no preliminary test) the official test by making measurements 
for both the Indoor and Outdoor Air Enthalpy Methods at equal intervals 
that span 10 minutes or less. Discontinue these measurement only after 
obtaining a 30-minute period where the specified test condition and test 
operating tolerances are satisfied. To constitute a valid official test:
    (1) Achieve the energy balance specified in section 3.1.1; and,
    (2) For cases where a preliminary test is conducted, the capacities 
determined using the Indoor Air Enthalpy Method from the official and 
preliminary test periods must agree within 2.0 percent.
    b. For space cooling tests, calculate capacity from the outdoor air 
enthalpy measurements as specified in section 7.3.3.2 of ASHRAE Standard 
37-88 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22). Calculate heating 
capacity based on outdoor air enthalpy measurements as specified in 
section 7.3.4.2 of the same ASHRAE Standard. Adjust outdoor side 
capacities according to section 7.3.3.3 of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22) to account for line losses 
when testing split systems. Do not correct the average electrical power 
measurement as described in section 8.5.3 of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22).
    3.11.2 If using the Compressor Calibration Method as the secondary 
test method.
    a. Conduct separate calibration tests using a calorimeter to 
determine the refrigerant flow rate. Or for cases where the superheat of 
the refrigerant leaving the evaporator is less than 5 [deg]F, use the 
calorimeter to measure total capacity rather than refrigerant flow rate. 
Conduct these calibration tests at the same test conditions as specified 
for the tests in this Appendix. Operate the unit for at least one hour 
or until obtaining equilibrium conditions before collecting data that 
will be used in determining the average refrigerant flow rate or total 
capacity. Sample the data at equal intervals that span 10 minutes or 
less. Determine average flow rate or average capacity from data sampled 
over a 30-minute period where the Table 7 (cooling) or the Table 13 
(heating) tolerances are satisfied. Otherwise, conduct the calibration 
tests according to ASHRAE Standard 23-93 (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 430.22), ASHRAE Standard 41.9-00 (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 430.22), and section 7.5 of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 430.22).
    b. Calculate space cooling and space heating capacities using the 
compressor calibration method measurements as specified in sections 
7.5.7 and 7.5.8, respectively, of ASHRAE Standard 37-88 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 430.22).

[[Page 275]]

    3.11.3 If using the Refrigerant Enthalpy Method as the secondary 
test method. Conduct this secondary method according to section 7.6 of 
ASHRAE Standard 37-88 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22). 
Calculate space cooling and space heating capacities using the 
refrigerant enthalpy method measurements as specified in sections 7.6.4 
and 7.6.5, respectively, of the same ASHRAE Standard.
    3.12 Rounding of space conditioning capacities for reporting 
purposes.
    a. When reporting rated capacities, round them off as follows:
    1. For capacities less than 20,000 Btu/h, round to the nearest 100 
Btu/h.
    2. For capacities between 20,000 and 37,999 Btu/h, round to the 
nearest 200 Btu/h.
    3. For capacities between 38,000 and 64,999 Btu/h, round to the 
nearest 500 Btu/h.
    b. For the capacities used to perform the section 4 calculations, 
however, round only to the nearest integer.
    4. CALCULATIONS OF SEASONAL PERFORMANCE DESCRIPTORS
    4.1 Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) Calculations. SEER must 
be calculated as follows: For equipment covered under sections 4.1.2, 
4.1.3, and 4.1.4, evaluate the seasonal energy efficiency ratio,

represented by bin temperature T<INF>j</INF> to the total number of 
hours in the cooling season (N), W.
    T<INF>j</INF> = the outdoor bin temperature, [deg]F. Outdoor 
temperatures are grouped or ``binned.'' Use bins of 5 [deg]F with the 8 
cooling season bin temperatures being 67, 72, 77, 82, 87, 92, 97, and 
102 [deg]F.
    j = the bin number. For cooling season calculations, j ranges from 1 
to 8.
    Additionally, for sections 4.1.2, 4.1.3, and 4.1.4, use a building 
cooling load, BL(T<INF>j</INF>). When referenced, evaluate 
BL(T<INF>j</INF>) for cooling using,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.049

where,
Q<INF>c</INF><SUP>k=2</SUP>(95) = the space cooling capacity determined 
from the A<INF>2</INF> Test and calculated as specified in section 3.3, 
Btu/h.

equation represent the selected outdoor design temperature and the zero-
load base temperature, respectively.

single-speed compressor that was tested with a fixed-speed indoor fan 
installed, a constant-air-volume-rate indoor fan installed, or with no 
indoor fan installed. a. Evaluate the seasonal energy efficiency ratio, 
expressed in units of Btu/watt-hour, using:

performance factor evaluated at a cooling load factor of 0.5, 
dimensionless.
    b. Refer to section 3.3 regarding the definition and calculation of 
Q<INF>c</INF>(82) and E<INF>c</INF>(82). If the optional tests described 
in section 3.2.1 are not conducted, set the cooling mode cyclic 
degradation coefficient, C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP>, to the default value 
specified in section 3.5.3. If these optional tests are conducted, set 
C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP> to the lower of:
    1. The value calculated as per section 3.5.3; or
    2. The section 3.5.3 default value of 0.25.
    4.1.2 SEER calculations for an air conditioner or heat pump having a 
single-speed compressor and a variable-speed variable-air-volume-rate 
indoor fan.
    4.1.2.1 Units covered by section 3.2.2.1 where indoor fan capacity 
modulation correlates with the outdoor dry bulb temperature. The 
manufacturer must provide information on how the indoor air volume rate 
or the indoor fan speed varies over the outdoor temperature range of 67 
[deg]F to 102 [deg]F. Calculate SEER using Equation 4.1-1. Evaluate the 
quantity q<INF>c</INF>(T<INF>j</INF>)/N in Equation 4.1-1 using,

dimensionless.
Q<INF>c</INF>(T<INF>j</INF>) = the space cooling capacity of the test 
unit when operating at outdoor temperature, T<INF>j</INF>, Btu/h.

n<INF>j</INF>/N = fractional bin hours for the cooling season; the ratio 
of the number of hours during the cooling season when the outdoor 
temperature fell within the range represented by bin temperature 
T<INF>j</INF> to the total number of hours in the cooling season, 
dimensionless.
    a. For the space cooling season, assign n<INF>j</INF>/N as specified 
in Table 16. Use Equation 4.1-2 to calculate the building load, 
BL(T<INF>j</INF>). Evaluate Q<INF>c</INF>(T<INF>j</INF>) using,

required A<INF>1</INF> and B<INF>1</INF> Tests (see section 3.2.2.1), 
FP<INF>c</INF><SUP>k=2</SUP> denotes the fan speed used during the 
required A<INF>2</INF> and B<INF>2</INF> Tests, and 
FP<INF>c</INF>(T<INF>j</INF>) denotes the fan speed used by the unit 
when the outdoor temperature equals T<INF>j</INF>. For units where 
indoor air volume rate is the primary control variable, the three 
FP<INF>c</INF>'s are similarly defined only now being expressed in terms 
of air volume rates rather than fan speeds. Refer to sections 3.2.2.1, 
3.1.4 to 3.1.4.2, and 3.3 regarding the definitions and calculations of 
Q<INF>c</INF><SUP>k=1</SUP>(82),

quantities as used in Equation 4.1.2-1. If the optional tests described 
in section 3.2.2.1 and Table 4 are not conducted, set the cooling mode 
cyclic degradation coefficient, C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP>, to the 
default value specified in section 3.5.3. If these optional tests are 
conducted, set C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP> to the lower of:

periods of the space heating season when the outdoor temperature fell 
within the range represented by bin temperature T<INF>j</INF> to the 
total number of hours in the heating season (N), W. For heat pumps

insufficient capacity or because the heat pump automatically turns off

T<INF>OD</INF> = the outdoor design temperature, [deg]F. An outdoor 
design temperature is specified for each generalized climatic region in 
Table 17.
C = 0.77, a correction factor which tends to improve the agreement 
between calculated and measured building loads, dimensionless.
DHR = the design heating requirement (see Definition 1.22), Btu/h.

    Calculate the minimum and maximum design heating requirements for 
each generalized climatic region as follows:

otherwise defined as follows:

    1. For a single-speed heat pump tested as per section 3.6.1, 
Qb<INF>h</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(47) = Qb<INF>h</INF>(47), the space heating 
capacity determined from the H1 Test.
    2. For a variable-speed heat pump, a section 3.6.2 single-speed heat 
pump, or a two-capacity heat pump not covered by item 3, 
Qb<INF>n</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(47) = Qb<INF>n</INF><SUP>k=2</SUP>(47), the 
space heating capacity determined from the H1<INF>2</INF> Test.
    3. For two-capacity, northern heat pumps (see Definition 1.46), 
Qb<SUP>k</SUP><INF>h</INF>(47) = Qb<SUP>k=1</SUP><INF>h</INF>(47), the 
space heating capacity determined from the H1<INF>1</INF> Test.
    If the optional H1<INF>N</INF> Test is conducted on a variable-speed 
heat pump, the manufacturer has the option of defining 
Qb<SUP>k</SUP><INF>h</INF>(47) as specified above in item 2 or as 
Qb<SUP>k</SUP><INF>h</INF>(47)=Q<SUP>k=N</SUP><INF>h</INF>(47), the 
space heating capacity determined from the H1<INF>N</INF> Test.
    For all heat pumps, HSPF accounts for the heating delivered and the 
energy consumed by auxiliary resistive elements when operating below the 
balance point. This condition occurs when the building load exceeds the 
space heating capacity of the heat pump

condenser. For HSPF calculations for all heat pumps, see either section 
4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, or 4.2.4, whichever applies.
    For heat pumps with heat comfort controllers (see Definition 1.28), 
HSPF also accounts for resistive heating contributed when operating 
above the heat-pump-plus-comfort-controller balance point as a result of 
maintaining a minimum supply temperature. For heat pumps having a heat 
comfort controller, see section 4.2.5 for the additional steps required 
for calculating the HSPF.

operating at the intermediate compressor speed used during the section 
3.6.4 H2<INF>V</INF> Test, provides a space heating capacity that is

Q<INF>h</INF><SUP>k=2</SUP>(T<INF>j</INF>) and 
E<INF>h</INF><SUP>k=2</SUP>(T<INF>j</INF>) correspond to maximum 
compressor speed operation and are derived from the results of the 
specified section 3.6.4 tests.
    4.2.5 Heat pumps having a heat comfort controller. Heat pumps having 
heat comfort controllers, when set to maintain a typical minimum air 
delivery temperature, will cause the heat pump condenser to operate less 
because of a greater contribution from the resistive elements. With a 
conventional heat pump, resistive heating is only initiated if the heat 
pump condenser cannot meet the building load (i.e., is delayed until a 
second stage call from the indoor thermostat). With a heat comfort 
controller, resistive heating can occur even though the heat pump 
condenser has adequate capacity to meet the building load (i.e., both on 
during a first stage call from the indoor thermostat). As a result, the 
outdoor temperature where the heat pump compressor no longer cycles 
(i.e., starts to run continuously), will be lower than if the heat pump 
did not have the heat comfort controller.
    4.2.5.1 Heat pump having a heat comfort controller: additional steps 
for calculating the HSPF of a heat pump having a single-speed compressor 
that was tested with a fixed-speed indoor fan installed, a constant-air-
volume-rate indoor fan installed, or with no indoor fan installed. 
Calculate the space heating capacity and electrical power of the heat 
pump without the heat comfort controller being active as specified in 
section 4.2.1 (Equations 4.2.1-4 and 4.2.1-5) for each outdoor bin 
temperature, T<INF>j</INF>, that is listed in Table 17. Denote these 
capacities and electrical powers by using the subscript ``hp'' instead 
of ``h.'' Calculate the mass flow rate (expressed in pounds-mass of dry 
air per hour) and the specific heat of the indoor air (expressed in Btu/
lbm<INF>da</INF> [middot] [deg]F) from the results of the H1 Test using:

nominal temperature of the air leaving the heat pump condenser coil

heating capacity and electrical power from Case 1 or Case 2, whichever 
applies.

T<INF>o</INF>(T<INF>j</INF>) <ls-thn-eq>= T<INF>cc</INF>, resistive 
heating may be required; evaluate Equation 4.2.1-2 for all bins.
    Case 2. For outdoor bin temperatures where

[[Page 301]]

    2.1 Test room requirements. a. Test using two side-by-side rooms, an 
indoor test room and an outdoor test room. For multiple-split air 
conditioners and heat pumps (see Definition 1.30), however, use as many 
available indoor test rooms as needed to accommodate the total number of 
indoor units. These rooms must comply with the requirements specified in 
sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.3 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 430.22).

                                * * * * *

    2.2 Test unit installation requirements. a. Install the unit 
according to section 8.2 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 430.22). With respect to interconnecting tubing 
used when testing split systems, however, follow the requirements given 
in section 6.1.3.5 of ARI Standard 210/240-2006 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 430.22). When testing triple-split systems (see 
Definition 1.44), use the tubing length specified in section 6.1.3.5 of 
ARI Standard 210/240-2006 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22) 
to connect the outdoor coil, indoor compressor section, and indoor coil 
while still meeting the requirement of exposing 10 feet of the tubing to 
outside conditions. When testing split systems having multiple indoor 
coils, connect each indoor fan-coil to the outdoor unit using: (a) 25 
feet of tubing, or (b) tubing furnished by the manufacturer, whichever 
is longer. If they are needed to make a secondary measurement of 
capacity, install refrigerant pressure measuring instruments as 
described in section 8.2.5 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 430.22). Refer to section 2.10 of this Appendix to 
learn which secondary methods require refrigerant pressure measurements. 
At a minimum, insulate the low-pressure line(s) of a split-system with 
insulation having an inside diameter that matches the refrigerant tubing 
and a nominal thickness of 0.5 inch.
    b. For units designed for both horizontal and vertical installation 
or for both up-flow and down-flow vertical installations, the 
manufacturer must specify the orientation used for testing. Conduct 
testing with the following installed:
    (1) the most restrictive filter(s);
    (2) supplementary heating coils; and
    (3) other equipment specified as part of the unit, including all 
hardware used by a heat comfort controller if so equipped (see 
Definition 1.28). For small-duct, high-velocity systems, configure all 
balance dampers or restrictor devices on or inside the unit to fully 
open or lowest restriction.

                                * * * * *

    2.2.3 Special requirements for multi-split air conditioners and heat 
pumps, and systems composed of multiple mini-split units (outdoor units 
located side-by-side) that would normally operate using two or more 
indoor thermostats. For any test where the system is operated at part 
load (i.e., one or more compressors ``off'', operating at the 
intermediate or minimum compressor speed, or at low compressor 
capacity), the manufacturer shall designate the particular indoor coils 
that are turned off during the test. For variable-speed systems, the 
manufacturer must designate at least one indoor unit that is turned off 
for all tests conducted at minimum compressor speed. For all other part-
load tests, the manufacturer shall choose to turn off zero, one, two, or 
more indoor units. The chosen configuration shall remain unchanged for 
all tests conducted at the same compressor speed/capacity. For any 
indoor coil that is turned off during a test, take steps to cease forced 
airflow through this indoor coil and block its outlet duct. Because 
these types of systems will have more than one indoor fan and possibly 
multiple outdoor fans and compressor systems, references in this test 
procedure to a single indoor fan, outdoor fan, and compressor means all 
indoor fans, all outdoor fans, and all compressor systems that are 
turned on during the test.

                                * * * * *

    2.2.5 Additional refrigerant charging requirements. Charging 
according to the ``manufacturer's published instructions,'' as stated in 
section 8.2 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 430.22), means the manufacturer's installation instructions that 
come packaged with the unit. * * *

                                * * * * *

    2.4.1 Outlet plenum for the indoor unit. a. Attach a plenum to the 
outlet of the indoor coil. (Note: for some packaged systems, the indoor 
coil may be located in the outdoor test room.)
    b. For systems having multiple indoor coils, attach a plenum to each 
indoor coil outlet. Connect two or more outlet plenums to a single 
common duct so that each indoor coil ultimately connects to an airflow 
measuring apparatus (section 2.6). If using more than one indoor test 
room, do likewise, creating one or more common ducts within each test 
room that contains multiple indoor coils. At the plane where each plenum 
enters a common duct, install an adjustable airflow damper and use it to 
equalize the static pressure in each plenum. Each outlet air temperature 
grid (section 2.5.4) and airflow measuring apparatus are located 
downstream of the inlet(s) to the common duct.
    c. For small-duct, high-velocity systems, install an outlet plenum 
that has a diameter

[[Page 302]]

that is equal to or less than the value listed below. The limit depends 
only on the cooling Full-Load Air Volume Rate (see section 3.1.4.1.1) 
and is effective regardless of the flange dimensions on the outlet of 
the unit (or an air supply plenum adapter accessory, if installed in 
accordance with the manufacturer's installation instructions).
    d. Add a static pressure tap to each face of the (each) outlet 
plenum, if rectangular, or at four evenly distributed locations along 
the circumference of an oval or round plenum. Create a manifold that 
connects the four static pressure taps. Figure 1 shows two of the three 
options allowed for the manifold configuration; the third option is the 
broken-ring, four-to-one manifold configuration that is shown in Figure 
7a of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 
430.22). See Figures 7a, 7b, 7c, and 8 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22) for the cross-sectional 
dimensions and minimum length of the (each) plenum and the locations for 
adding the static pressure taps for units tested with and without an 
indoor fan installed.

*If the outlet plenum is rectangular, calculate its equivalent diameter using (4A)/P, where A is the area and P
  is the perimeter of the rectangular plenum, and compare it to the listed maximum diameter.

    2.4.2 Inlet plenum for the indoor unit. Install an inlet plenum when 
testing a coil-only indoor unit or a packaged system where the indoor 
coil is located in the outdoor test room. Add static pressure taps at 
the center of each face of this plenum, if rectangular, or at four 
evenly distributed locations along the circumference of an oval or round 
plenum. Make a manifold that connects the four static-pressure taps 
using one of the three configurations specified in section 2.4.1. See 
Figures 7b, 7c, and Figure 8 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 430.22) for cross-sectional dimensions, the minimum 
length of the inlet plenum, and the locations of the static-pressure 
taps. When testing a ducted unit having an indoor fan (and the indoor 
coil is in the indoor test room), the manufacturer has the option to 
test with or without an inlet plenum installed. Space limitations within 
the test room may dictate that the manufacturer choose the latter 
option. If used, construct the inlet plenum and add the four static-
pressure taps as shown in Figure 8 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22). Manifold the four static-
pressure taps using one of the three configurations specified in section 
2.4.1. Never use an inlet plenum when testing a non-ducted system.

                                * * * * *

    2.5.3 Section 6.5.2 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 430.22) describes the method for fabricating 
static-pressure taps. * * *

                                * * * * *

    2.5.4.3 Minimizing air leakage. For small-duct, high-velocity 
systems, install an air damper near the end of the interconnecting duct, 
just prior to the transition to the airflow measuring apparatus of 
section 2.6. To minimize air leakage, adjust this damper such that the 
pressure in the receiving chamber of the airflow measuring apparatus is 
no more than 0.5 inch of water higher than the surrounding test room 
ambient. In lieu of installing a separate damper, use the outlet air 
damper box of sections 2.5 and 2.5.4.1 if it allows variable 
positioning. Also apply these steps to any conventional indoor blower 
unit that creates a static pressure within the receiving chamber of the 
airflow measuring apparatus that exceeds the test room ambient pressure 
by more than 0.5 inches of water column.

    3.1.1 Primary and secondary test methods. * * *
    For this capacity comparison, use the Indoor Air Enthalpy Method 
capacity that is calculated in section 7.3 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22) (and, if testing a coil-
only unit, do not make the after-test fan heat adjustments described in 
section 3.3, 3.4, 3.7, and 3.10 of this Appendix). * * *

                                * * * * *

    3.1.4.1.1 Cooling Full-Load Air Volume Rate for Ducted Units. The 
manufacturer

[[Page 303]]

must specify the Cooling Full-load Air Volume Rate. Use this value as 
long as the following two requirements are satisfied. First, when 
conducting the A or A<INF>2</INF> Test (exclusively), the measured air 
volume rate, when divided by the measured indoor air-side total cooling 
capacity must not exceed 37.5 cubic feet per minute of standard air 
(scfm) per 1000 Btu/h. If this ratio is exceeded, reduce the air volume 
rate until this ratio is equaled. Use this reduced air volume rate for 
all tests that call for using the Cooling Full-load Air Volume Rate. The 
second requirement is as follows:
    a. For all ducted units tested with an indoor fan installed, except 
those having a variable-speed, constant-air-volume-rate indoor fan. The 
second requirement applies exclusively to the A or A<INF>2</INF> Test 
and is met as follows.
    1. Achieve the Cooling Full-load Air Volume Rate, determined in 
accordance with the previous paragraph;
    2. Measure the external static pressure;
    3. If this pressure is equal to or greater than the applicable 
minimum external static pressure cited in Table 2, this second 
requirement is satisfied. Use the current air volume rate for all tests 
that require the Cooling Full-load Air Volume Rate.
    4. If the Table 2 minimum is not equaled or exceeded,
    4a. reduce the air volume rate until the applicable Table 2 minimum 
is equaled or
    4b. until the measured air volume rate equals 95 percent of the air 
volume rate from step 1, whichever occurs first.
    5. If the conditions of step 4a occur first, this second requirement 
is satisfied. Use the step 4a reduced air volume rate for all tests that 
require the Cooling Full-load Air Volume Rate.
    6. If the conditions of step 4b occur first, make an incremental 
change to the set-up of the indoor fan (e.g., next highest fan motor pin 
setting, next highest fan motor speed) and repeat the evaluation process 
beginning at above step 1. If the indoor fan set-up cannot be further 
changed, reduce the air volume rate until the applicable Table 2 minimum 
is equaled. Use this reduced air volume rate for all tests that require 
the Cooling Full-load Air Volume Rate.
    b. For ducted units that are tested with a variable-speed, constant-
air-volume-rate indoor fan installed. * * *

    3.1.4.4.3 Ducted heating-only heat pumps. The manufacturer must 
specify the Heating Full-load Air Volume Rate.
    a. For all ducted heating-only heat pumps tested with an indoor fan 
installed, except those having a variable-speed, constant-air-volume-
rate indoor fan. Conduct the following steps only during the first test, 
the H1 or H1<INF>2</INF> Test.
    1. Achieve the Heating Full-load Air Volume Rate.
    2. Measure the external static pressure.
    3. If this pressure is equal to or greater than the Table 2 minimum 
external static pressure that applies given the heating-only heat pump's 
rated heating capacity, use the current air volume rate for all tests 
that require the Heating Full-load Air Volume Rate.
    4. If the Table 2 minimum is not equaled or exceeded,
    4a. reduce the air volume rate until the applicable Table 2 minimum 
is equaled or
    4b. until the measured air volume rate equals 95 percent of the 
manufacturer-specified Full-load Air Volume Rate, whichever occurs 
first.
    5. If the conditions of step 4a occurs first, use the step 4a 
reduced air volume rate for all tests that require the Heating Full-load 
Air Volume Rate.
    6. If the conditions of step 4b occur first, make an incremental 
change to the set-up of the indoor fan (e.g., next highest fan motor pin 
setting, next highest fan motor speed) and repeat the evaluation process 
beginning at above step 1. If the indoor fan set-up cannot be further 
changed, reduce the air volume rate until the applicable Table 2 minimum 
is equaled. Use this reduced air volume rate for all tests that require 
the Heating Full-load Air Volume Rate.
    b. For ducted heating-only heat pumps that are tested with a 
variable-speed, constant-air-volume-rate indoor fan installed. * * *

    3.2.3 Tests for a unit having a two-capacity compressor. (See 
Definition 1.45.)
    a. Conduct four steady-state wet coil tests: the A<INF>2</INF>, 
B<INF>2</INF>, B<INF>1</INF>, and F<INF>1</INF> Tests. Use the two 
optional dry-coil tests, the steady-state C<INF>1</INF> Test and the 
cyclic D<INF>1</INF> Test, to determine the cooling-mode cyclic-
degradation coefficient, C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP>. If the two optional 
tests are conducted but yield a tested C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP> that 
exceeds the default C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP> or if the two optional 
tests are not conducted, assign C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP> the default 
value of 0.25. Table 5 specifies test conditions for these six tests.

                                * * * * *

    d. If a two-capacity air conditioner or heat pump locks out low-
capacity operation at higher outdoor temperatures, then use the two 
optional dry-coil tests, the steady-state C<INF>2</INF> Test and the 
cyclic D<INF>2</INF> Test, to determine the cooling-mode cyclic-
degradation coefficient that only applies to on/off cycling from high 
capacity, C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP>(k=2). If the two optional tests are 
conducted but yield a tested C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP>(k=2) that exceeds 
the default C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP>(k=2) or if the two optional tests 
are not conducted, assign C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP>(k=2) the default 
value. The default C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP>(k=2) is the same value as 
determined or assigned for the low-capacity cyclic-degradation 
coefficient, C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP> [or equivalently, 
C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP>(k=1)].

    c. For multiple-split air conditioners and heat pumps (except where 
noted), the following procedures supersede the above requirements: For 
all Table 6 tests specified for a minimum compressor speed, at least one 
indoor unit must be turned off. The manufacturer shall designate the 
particular indoor unit(s) that is turned off. The manufacturer must also 
specify the compressor speed used for the Table 6 E<INF>V</INF> Test, a 
cooling-mode intermediate compressor speed that falls within \1/4\ and 
\3/4\ of the difference between the maximum and minimum cooling-mode 
speeds. The manufacturer should prescribe

[[Page 307]]

an intermediate speed that is expected to yield the highest EER for the 
given E<INF>V</INF> Test conditions and bracketed compressor speed 
range. The manufacturer can designate that one or more indoor units are 
turned off for the E<INF>V</INF> Test.

    3.4 Test procedures for the optional steady-state dry-coil cooling-
mode tests (the C, C<INF>1</INF>, C<INF>2</INF>, and G<INF>1</INF> 
Tests).

                                * * * * *

    b. Denote the resulting total space cooling capacity and electrical 
power derived from the test as Q<INF>ss,dry</INF> and 
E<INF>ss,dry</INF>. With regard to a section 3.3 deviation, do not 
adjust Q<INF>ss,dry</INF> for duct losses (i.e., do not apply section 
7.3.3.3 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 
430.22)). In preparing for the section 3.5 cyclic tests, record the 
average indoor-side air volume rate, V, specific heat of the air, Cp,a 
(expressed on dry air basis), specific volume of the air at the nozzles, 
v[min]<INF>n</INF>, humidity ratio at the nozzles, W<INF>n</INF>, and 
either pressure difference or velocity pressure for the flow nozzles. 
For units having a variable-speed indoor fan (that provides either a 
constant or variable air volume rate) that will or may be tested during 
the cyclic dry coil cooling mode test with the indoor fan turned off 
(see section 3.5), include the electrical power used by the indoor fan 
motor among the recorded parameters from the 30-minute test.
    3.5 Test procedures for the optional cyclic dry-coil cooling-mode 
tests (the D, D<INF>1</INF>, D<INF>2</INF>, and I<INF>1</INF> Tests).

                                * * * * *

    3.5.3 Cooling-mode cyclic-degradation coefficient calculation. Use 
the two optional dry-coil tests to determine the cooling-mode cyclic-
degradation coefficient, C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP>. Append ``(k=2)'' to 
the coefficient if it corresponds to a two-capacity unit cycling at high 
capacity. If the two optional tests are conducted but yield a tested 
C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP> that exceeds the default 
C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP> or if the two optional tests are not 
conducted, assign C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP> the default value of 0.25. 
The default value for two-capacity units cycling at high capacity, 
however, is the low-capacity coefficient, i.e., 
C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP>(k=2)=C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP>. Evaluate 
C<INF>D</INF><SUP>c</SUP> using the above results and those from the 
section 3.4 dry-coil steady-state test.

                                * * * * *

    3.6.1 * * * Conduct the optional High Temperature Cyclic (H1C) Test 
to determine the heating mode cyclic-degradation coefficient, 
C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP>. If this optional test is conducted but yields 
a tested C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> that exceeds the default 
C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> or if the optional test is not conducted, 
assign C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> the default value of 0.25.

    3.6.2 Tests for a heat pump having a single-speed compressor and a 
variable-speed, variable-air-volume-rate indoor fan: capacity modulation 
correlates with outdoor dry bulb temperature. Conduct five tests: two 
High Temperature Tests (H1<INF>2</INF> and H1<INF>1</INF>), one Frost 
Accumulation Test (H2<INF>2</INF>), and two Low Temperature Tests 
(H3<INF>2</INF> and H3<INF>1</INF>). Conducting an additional Frost 
Accumulation Test (H2<INF>1</INF>) is optional. Conduct the optional 
High Temperature Cyclic (H1C<INF>1</INF>) Test to determine the heating 
mode cyclic-degradation coefficient, C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP>. If this 
optional test is conducted but yields a tested C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> 
that exceeds the default C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> or if the optional 
test is not conducted, assign C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> the default 
value of 0.25. Test conditions for the seven tests are specified in 
Table 10. If the optional H2<INF>1</INF> Test is not performed, use the 
following equations to approximate the capacity and electrical power of 
the heat pump at the H2<INF>1</INF> test conditions:

                                * * * * *

    3.6.3 Tests for a heat pump having a two-capacity compressor (see 
Definition 1.45), including two-capacity, northern heat pumps (see 
Definition 1.46). a. Conduct one Maximum Temperature Test 
(H0<INF>1</INF>), two High Temperature Tests (H1<INF>2</INF> and 
H1<INF>1</INF>), one Frost Accumulation Test (H2<INF>2</INF>), and one 
Low Temperature Test (H3<INF>2</INF>). Conduct an additional Frost 
Accumulation Test (H2<INF>1</INF>) and Low Temperature Test 
(H3<INF>1</INF>) if both of the following conditions exist:
    1. Knowledge of the heat pump's capacity and electrical power at low 
compressor capacity for outdoor temperatures of 37 [deg]F and less is 
needed to complete the section 4.2.3 seasonal performance calculations; 
and
    2.The heat pump's controls allow low-capacity operation at outdoor 
temperatures of 37 [deg]F and less.
    If the above two conditions are met, an alternative to conducting 
the H2<INF>1</INF> Frost Accumulation is to use the following equations 
to approximate the capacity and electrical power:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR22OC07.078

    Determine the quantities Q<INF>h</INF><SUP>k=1</SUP> (47) and 
E<INF>h</INF><SUP>k=1</SUP> (47) from the H1<INF>1</INF> Test and 
evaluate them according to Section 3.7. Determine the quantities 
Q<INF>h</INF><SUP>k=1</SUP> (17) and E<INF>h</INF><SUP>k=1</SUP> (17) 
from the H3<INF>1</INF> Test and evaluate them according to Section 
3.10.
    b. Conduct the optional High Temperature Cyclic Test 
(H1C<INF>1</INF>) to determine the heating-mode cyclic-degradation 
coefficient, C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP>. If this optional test is 
conducted but yields a tested C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> that exceeds the 
default C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> or if the optional test is not 
conducted, assign C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> the default value of 0.25. 
If a two-capacity heat pump locks out low capacity operation at lower 
outdoor temperatures, conduct the optional High Temperature Cyclic Test 
(H1C<INF>2</INF>) to determine the high-capacity heating-mode cyclic-
degradation coefficient, C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> (k=2). If this 
optional test at high capacity is conducted but yields a tested 
C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> (k=2) that exceeds the default 
C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> (k=2) or if the optional test is not 
conducted, assign C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> the default value. The 
default C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> (k=2) is the same value as determined 
or assigned for the low-capacity cyclic-degradation coefficient, 
C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> [or equivalently, C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> 
(k=1)]. Table 11 specifies test conditions for these nine tests.

a tested C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> that exceeds the default 
C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> or if the optional test is not conducted, 
assign C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> the default value of 0.25. Test 
conditions for the eight tests are specified in Table 12. * * *
    c. For multiple-split heat pumps (only), the following procedures 
supersede the above requirements. For all Table 12 tests specified for a 
minimum compressor speed, at least one indoor unit must be turned off. 
The manufacturer shall designate the particular indoor unit(s) that is 
turned off. The manufacturer must also specify the compressor speed used 
for the Table 12 H2<INF>V</INF> Test, a heating-mode intermediate 
compressor speed that falls within \1/4\ and \3/4\ of the difference 
between the maximum and minimum heating-mode speeds. The manufacturer 
should prescribe an intermediate speed that is expected to yield the 
highest COP for the given H2<INF>V</INF> Test conditions and bracketed 
compressor speed range. The manufacturer can designate that one or more 
specific indoor units are turned off for the H2<INF>V</INF> Test.

    3.8.1 Heating mode cyclic-degradation coefficient calculation. Use 
the results from the optional cyclic test and the required steady-state 
test that were conducted at the same test conditions to determine the 
heating-mode cyclic-degradation coefficient C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP>. 
Add ``(k=2)'' to the coefficient if it corresponds to a two-capacity 
unit cycling at high capacity. For the below calculation of the heating 
mode cyclic degradation coefficient, do not include the duct loss 
correction from section 7.3.3.3 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated 
by reference, see Sec. 430.22) in determining 
Q<INF>h</INF><SUP>k</SUP>(T<INF>cyc</INF>) (or q<INF>cyc</INF>). If the 
optional cyclic test is conducted but yields a tested 
C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> that exceeds the default 
C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> or if the optional test is not conducted, 
assign C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> the default value of 0.25. The default 
value for two-capacity units cycling at high capacity, however, is the 
low-capacity coefficient, i.e., C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> (k=2) = 
C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP>. The tested C<INF>D</INF><SUP>h</SUP> is 
calculated as follows:

    c. The official test period begins when the preliminary test period 
ends, at defrost termination. The official test period ends at the 
termination of the next occurring automatic defrost cycle. When testing 
a heat pump that uses a time-adaptive defrost control system (see 
Definition 1.42), however, manually initiate the defrost cycle that ends 
the official test period at the instant indicated by instructions 
provided by the manufacturer. If the heat pump has not undergone a 
defrost after 6 hours, immediately conclude the test and use the results 
from the full 6-hour period to calculate the average space heating 
capacity and average electrical power consumption.
    For heat pumps that turn the indoor fan off during the defrost 
cycle, take steps to cease forced airflow through the indoor coil and 
block the outlet duct whenever the heat pump's controls cycle off the 
indoor fan. If it is installed, use the outlet damper box described in 
section 2.5.4.1 to affect the blocked outlet duct.

        Measuring the Energy Consumption of Furnaces and Boilers

    1.0 Scope. The scope of this appendix is as specified in section 2.0 
of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993.
    2.0 Definitions. Definitions include the definitions specified in 
section 3 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993 and the following additional 
and modified definitions:
    2.1 ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993 means the test standard published 
in 1993 by ASHRAE, approved by the American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI) on October 4, 1993, and entitled ``Method of Testing for Annual 
Fuel Utilization Efficiency of Residential Central Furnaces and 
Boilers'' (with errata of October 24, 1996).
    2.2 ASHRAE means the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and 
Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc.
    2.3 Thermal stack damper means a type of stack damper which is 
dependent for operation exclusively upon the direct conversion of 
thermal energy of the stack gases to open the damper.
    2.4 Isolated combustion system. The definition of isolation 
combustion system in section 3 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993 is 
incorporated with the addition of the following: ``The unit is installed 
in an un-conditioned indoor space isolated from the heated space.''
    3.0 Classifications. Classifications are as specified in section 4 
of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993.
    4.0 Requirements. Requirements are as specified in section 5 of 
ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993.
    5.0 Instruments. Instruments must be as specified in section 6 of 
ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993.
    6.0 Apparatus. The apparatus used in conjunction with the furnace or 
boiler during the testing shall be as specified in section 7 of ANSI/
ASHRAE Standard 103-1993 except for the second paragraph of section 
7.2.2.2 and except for section 7.2.2.5, and as specified in section 6.1 
of this appendix.
    6.1 Downflow furnaces. Install the internal section of vent pipe the 
same size as the flue collar for connecting the flue collar to the top 
of the unit, if not supplied by the manufacturer. Do not insulate the 
internal vent pipe during the jacket loss test (if conducted) described 
in section 8.6 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993 or the steady-state test 
described in section 9.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993. Do not 
insulate the internal vent pipe before the cool-down and heat-up tests 
described in sections 9.5 and 9.6, respectively, of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 
103-1993. If the vent pipe is surrounded by a metal jacket, do not 
insulate the metal jacket. Install a 5-ft test stack of the same cross 
sectional area or perimeter as the vent pipe above the top of the 
furnace. Tape or seal around the junction connecting the vent pipe and 
the 5-ft test stack. Insulate the 5-ft test stack with insulation having 
an R-value not less than 7 and an outer layer of aluminum foil. (See 
Figure 3-E of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993.)
    7.0 Testing conditions. The testing conditions shall be as specified 
in section 8 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993 with errata of October 24, 
1996, except for section 8.6.1.1; and as specified in section 7.1 of 
this appendix.
    7.1 Measurement of jacket surface temperature. The jacket of the 
furnace or boiler shall be subdivided into 6-inch squares when 
practical, and otherwise into 36-square-inch regions comprising 4 in. x 
9 in. or 3 in. x 12 in. sections, and the surface temperature at the 
center of each square or section shall be determined with a surface 
thermocouple. The 36-square-inch areas shall be recorded in groups where 
the temperature differential of the 36-square-inch area is less than 10 
[deg]F for temperature up to 100 [deg]F above room temperature and less 
than 20 [deg]F for temperature more than 100 [deg]F above room 
temperature. For forced air central furnaces, the circulating air blower 
compartment is considered as part of the duct system and no surface 
temperature measurement of the blower compartment needs to be recorded 
for the purpose of this test. For downflow furnaces, measure all cabinet 
surface temperatures of the heat exchanger and combustion section, 
including the bottom around the outlet duct, and the burner door, using 
the 36 square-inch thermocouple grid. The cabinet surface temperatures 
around the blower section do not need to be measured (See figure 3-E of 
ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993.)
    8.0 Test procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified 
in section 9 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993 except for sections 
9.5.1.1, 9.5.1.2.1, 9.5.1.2.2, 9.5.2.1, and section 9.7.1. ; and as 
specified in sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5, of this appendix.

    8.1 Input to interrupted ignition device. For burners equipped with 
an interrupted ignition device, record the nameplate electric power used 
by the ignition device, PE<INF>IG</INF>, or use PE<INF>IG</INF>=0.4 kW 
if no nameplate power input is provided. Record the nameplate ignition 
device on-time interval, t<INF>IG</INF>, or measure the on-time period 
at the beginning of the test at the time the burner is turned on with a 
stop watch, if no nameplate value is given. Set t<INF>IG</INF>=0 and 
PE<INF>IG</INF>=0 if the device on-time is less than or equal to 5 
seconds after the burner is on.
    8.2 Gas- and oil-fueled gravity and forced air central furnaces 
without stack dampers cool-down test. Turn off the main burner after 
steady-state testing is completed, and measure the flue gas temperature 
by means of the thermocouple grid described in section 7.6 of ANSI/
ASHRAE 103-1993 at 1.5 minutes (T<INF>F,OFF</INF>(t<INF>3</INF>)) and 9 
minutes (T<INF>F,OFF</INF>(t<INF>4</INF>)) after the burner shuts off. 
An integral draft diverter shall remain blocked and insulated, and the 
stack restriction shall remain in place. On atmospheric systems with an 
integral draft diverter or draft hood, equipped with either an 
electromechanical inlet damper or an electro-mechanical flue damper that 
closes within 10 seconds after the burner shuts off to restrict the flow 
through the heat exchanger in the off-cycle, bypass or adjust the 
control for the electromechanical damper so that the damper remains open 
during the cool-down test. For furnaces that employ post purge, measure 
the length of the post-purge period with a stopwatch. The time from 
burner OFF to combustion blower OFF (electrically de-energized) shall be 
recorded as t<INF>p</INF>. For the case where t<INF>p</INF> is intended 
to be greater than 180 seconds, stop the combustion blower at 180 
seconds and use that value for t<INF>p</INF>. Measure the flue gas 
temperature by means of the thermocouple grid described in section 7.6 
of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-1993 at the end of post-purge period, t<INF>p</INF> 
(T<INF>F,OFF</INF>(t<INF>p</INF>)), and at the time (1.5 + 
t<INF>p</INF>) minutes (T<INF>F,OFF</INF>(t<INF>3</INF>)) and (9.0 + 
t<INF>p</INF>) minutes (T<INF>F,OFF</INF>(t<INF>4</INF>)) after the main 
burner shuts off. For the case where the measured tp is less than or 
equal to 30 seconds, it shall be tested as if there is no post purge and 
t<INF>p</INF> shall be set equal to 0.
    8.3 Gas- and oil-fueled gravity and forced air central furnaces 
without stack dampers with adjustable fan control--cool-down test. For a 
furnace with adjustable fan control, this time delay will be 3.0 minutes 
for non-condensing furnaces or 1.5 minutes for condensing furnaces or 
until the supply air temperature drops to a value of 40 [deg]F above the 
inlet air temperature, whichever results in the longest fan on-time. For 
a furnace without adjustable fan control or with the type of adjustable 
fan control whose range of adjustment does not allow for the delay time 
specified above, the control shall be bypassed and the fan manually 
controlled to give the delay times specified above. For a furnace which 
employs a single motor to drive the power burner and the indoor air 
circulating blower, the power burner and indoor air circulating blower 
shall be stopped together.
    8.4 Gas-and oil-fueled boilers without stack dampers cool-down test. 
After steady-state testing has been completed, turn the main burner(s) 
OFF and measure the flue gas temperature at 3.75 
(T<INF>F,OFF</INF>(t<INF>3</INF>)) and 22.5 
(T<INF>F,OFF</INF>(t<INF>4</INF>)) minutes after the burner shut off, 
using the thermocouple grid described in section 7.6 of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-
1993. During this off-period, for units that do not have pump delay 
after shutoff, no water shall be allowed to circulate through the hot 
water boilers. For units that have pump delay on shutoff, except those 
having pump controls sensing water temperature, the pump shall be 
stopped by the unit control and the time t<SUP>+</SUP>, between burner 
shutoff and pump shutoff shall be measured within one-second accuracy. 
For units having pump delay controls that sense water temperature, the 
pump shall be operated for 15 minutes and t<SUP>+</SUP> shall be 15 
minutes. While the pump is operating, the inlet water temperature and 
flow rate shall be maintained at the same values as used during the 
steady-state test as specified in sections 9.1 and 8.4.2.3 of ANSI/
ASHRAE 103-1993.
    For boilers that employ post purge, measure the length of the post-
purge period with a stopwatch. The time from burner OFF to combustion 
blower OFF (electrically de-energized) shall be recorded as 
t<INF>P</INF>. For the case where t<INF>P</INF> is intended to be 
greater than 180 seconds, stop the combustion blower at 180 seconds and 
use that value for t<INF>P</INF>. Measure the flue gas temperature by 
means of the thermocouple grid described in section 7.6 of ANSI/ASHRAE 
103-1993 at the end of the post purge period 
t<INF>P</INF>(T<INF>F,OFF</INF>(t<INF>P</INF>)) and at the time (3.75 + 
t<INF>P</INF>) minutes (T<INF>F,OFF</INF>(t<INF>3</INF>)) and (22.5 + 
t<INF>P</INF>) minutes (T<INF>F,OFF</INF>(t<INF>4</INF>)) after the main 
burner shuts off. For the case where the measured t<INF>P</INF> is less 
or equal to 30 seconds, it shall be tested as if there is no post purge 
and t<INF>P</INF> shall be set to equal 0.

products of combustion in the event of no draft, back draft, or stoppage 
beyond the draft diverter, (2) prevent a back draft from entering the 
vented heater, and (3) neutralize the stack action of the chimney or gas 
vent upon the operation of the vented heater.

designed to open the venting system when the appliance is in operation 
and to

[[Page 322]]

close off the venting system when the appliance is in the standby 
condition.
    1.25 ``Stack gases'' means the flue gases combined with dilution air 
that enters at the integral draft diverter, draft hood or barometric 
draft regulator.
    1.26 ``Steady-state conditions for vented home heating equipment'' 
means equilibrium conditions as indicated by temperature variations of 
not more than 5 [deg]F (2.8C) in the flue gas temperature for units 
equipped with draft hoods, barometric draft regulators or direct vent 
systems, in three successive readings taken 15 minutes apart or not more 
than 3 [deg]F (1.7C) in the stack gas temperature for units equipped 
with integral draft diverters in three successive readings taken 15 
minutes apart.
    1.27 ``Step-modulating control'' means a control that either cycles 
off and on at the low input if the heating load is light, or gradually, 
increases the heat input to meet any higher heating load that cannot be 
met with the low firing rate.
    1.28 ``Thermal stack damper'' means a type of stack damper which is 
dependent for operation exclusively upon the direct conversion of 
thermal energy of the stack gases into movement of the damper plate.
    1.29 ``Two stage control'' means a control that either cycles a 
burner at the reduced heat input rate and off or cycles a burner at the 
maximum heat input rate and off.
    1.30 ``Vaporizing-type oil burner'' means a device with an oil 
vaporizing bowl or other receptacle designed to operate by vaporizing 
liquid fuel oil by the heat of combustion and mixing the vaporized fuel

which the air for combustion is taken from the outside atmosphere and a 
vent terminal from which flue gases are discharged.
    1.32 ``Vent limiter'' means a device which limits the flow of air 
from the atmospheric diaphragm chamber of a gas pressure regulator to 
the atmosphere. A vent limiter may be a limiting orifice or other 
limiting device.
    1.33 ``Vent pipe'' means the passages and conduits in a direct vent 
system through which gases pass from the combustion chamber to the 
outdoor air.

                         2.0 Testing conditions.

to, and vertically above the outlet of gas fueled vented home heating 
equipment employing draft diverters or draft hoods with vertically 
discharging outlets, a five (5) foot long test stack having a cross 
sectional area the same size as the draft diverter outlet.
    Attach to the outlet of vented heaters having a horizontally 
discharging draft diverter or draft hood outlet a 90 degree elbow, and a 
five (5) foot long vertical test stack. A horizontal section of pipe may 
be used on the floor furnace between the diverter and the elbow if 
necessary to clear any framing used in the installation. Use the minimum 
length of pipe possible for this section. Use stack, elbow, and 
horizontal section with same cross sectional area as the diverter 
outlet.
    2.2.2 Oil fueled vented home heating equipment (excluding direct 
vent systems). Use flue connections for oil fueled vented floor furnaces 
as specified in section 35 of UL 729-1976, sections 34.10 through 34.18 
of UL 730-1974 for oil fueled vented wall furnaces and sections 36.2 and 
36.3 of UL 896-1973 for oil fueled vented room heaters.
    2.2.3 Direct vent systems. Have the exhaust/air intake system 
supplied by the manufacturer in place during all tests. Test units 
intended for installation with a variety of vent pipe lengths with the 
minimum length recommended by the manufacturer. Do not connect a heater 
employing a direct vent system to a chimney or induced draft source. 
Vent the gas solely on the provision for venting incorporated in the 
heater and the vent/air intake system supplied with it.
    2.3 Fuel supply.
    2.3.1 Natural gas. For a vented heater utilizing natural gas, 
maintain the gas supply to the unit under test at a normal inlet test 
pressure immediately ahead of all controls at 7 to 10 inches water 
column. Maintain the regulator outlet pressure at normal test pressure 
approximately at that recommended by the manufacturer. Use natural gas 
having a specific gravity of approximately 0.65 and a higher heating 
value within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent of 1,025 Btu's per standard 
cubic foot. Determine the actual higher heating value in Btu's per 
standard cubic foot for the natural gas to be used in the test with an 
error no greater than one percent.
    2.3.2 Propane gas. For a vented heater utilizing propane gas, 
maintain the gas supply

[[Page 323]]

to the unit under test at a normal inlet pressure of 11 to 13 inches 
water column and a specific gravity of approximately 1.53. Maintain the 
regulator outlet pressure, on units so equipped, approximately at that 
recommended by the manufacturer. Use propane having a specific gravity 
of approximately 1.53 and a higher heating value within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent of 2,500 Btu's per standard cubic foot. 
Determine the actual higher heating value in Btu's per standard cubic

standard. Determine the actual higher heating value of the gas used in 
the test with an error no greater than one percent.
    2.3.4 Oil supply. For a vented heater utilizing fuel oil, use No. 1, 
fuel oil (kerosene) for vaporizing-type burners and either No. 1 or No. 
2 fuel oil, as specified by the manufacturer, for mechanical atomizing 
type burners. Use No. 1 fuel oil with a viscosity meeting the 
specifications as specified in UL-730-1974, section 36.9. Use test fuel 
conforming to the specifications given in tables 2 and 3 of ANSI 
Standard Z91.1-1972
for No. 1 and No. 2 fuel oil. Measure the higher heating value of the 
test fuel with an error no greater than one percent.
    2.3.5 Electrical supply. For auxiliary electric components of a 
vented heater, maintain the electrical supply to the test unit within 
one percent of the nameplate voltage for the entire test cycle. If a 
voltage range is used for nameplate voltage, maintain the electrical 
supply within one percent of the mid-point of the nameplate voltage 
range.
    2.4 Burner adjustments.
    2.4.1 Gas burner adjustments. Adjust the burners of gas fueled 
vented heaters to their maximum Btu ratings at the test pressure 
specified in section 2.3 of this appendix. Correct the burner volumetric 
flow rate to 60 [deg]F (15.6C) and 30 inches of mercury barometric 
pressure, set the fuel flow rate to obtain a heat rate of within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent of the hourly Btu rating specified by the 
manufacturer as measured after 15 minutes of operation starting with all 
parts of the vented heater at room temperature. Set the primary air 
shutters in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations to give a 
good flame at this adjustment. Do not allow the deposit of carbon during 
any test specified herein.
    If a vent limiting means is provided on a gas pressure regulator, 
have it in place during all tests.
    For gas fueled heaters with modulating controls adjust the controls 
to operate the heater at the maximum fuel input rate. Set the thermostat 
control to the maximum setting. Start the heater by turning the safety 
control valve to the ``on'' position. In order to prevent modulation of 
the burner at maximum input, place the thermostat sensing element in a 
temperature control bath which is held at a temperature below the 
maximum set point temperature of the control.
    For gas fueled heaters with modulating controls adjust the controls 
to operate the heater at the reduced fuel input rate. Set the thermostat 
control to the minimum setting. Start the heater by turning the safety 
control valve to the ``on'' position. If ambient test room temperature 
is above the lowest control set point temperature, initiate burner 
operation by placing the thermostat sensing element in a temperature 
control bath that is held at a temperature below the minimum set point 
temperature of the control.
    2.4.2 Oil burner adjustments. Adjust the burners of oil fueled 
vented heaters to give the CO<INF>2</INF> reading recommended by the 
manufacturer and an hourly Btu input, during the steady-state 
performance test described below, which is within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent of the heater manufacturer's specified normal 
hourly Btu input rating. On units employing a power burner do not allow 
smoke in the flue to exceed a No. 1 smoke during the steady-state 
performance test as measured by the procedure in ANSI Standard Z11.182-
1965 (R1971) (ASTM D 2156-65 (1970)). If, on units employing a power 
burner, the smoke in the flue exceeds a No. 1 smoke during the steady-
state test, readjust the burner to give a lower smoke reading, and, if 
necessary a lower CO<INF>2</INF> reading, and start all tests over. 
Maintain the average draft over the fire and in the flue during the 
steady-state performance test at that recommended by the manufacturer 
within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.005 inches of water gauge. Do not make 
additional adjustments to the burner during the required series of 
performance tests. The instruments and measuring apparatus for this test 
are described in section 6.3 of ANSI standard Z91.1-1972.
    2.5 Circulating air adjustments.
    2.5.1 Forced air vented wall furnaces (including direct vent 
systems). During tests maintain the air flow through the heater as 
specified by the manufacturer and operate the vented heater with the

    2.6.1 Gas fueled vented home heating equipment (including direct 
vent systems). For units employing an integral draft diverter, install 
nine thermocouples, wired in parallel, in a horizontal plane in the five 
foot test stack located one foot from the test stack inlet. Equalize the 
length of all thermocouple leads before paralleling. Locate one 
thermocouple in the center of the stack. Locate eight thermocouples 
along imaginary lines intersecting at right angles in this horizontal 
plane at points one third and two thirds of the distance between the 
center of the stack and the stack wall.
    For units which employ a direct vent system, locate at least one 
thermocouple at the center of each flue way exiting the heat exchanger. 
Provide radiation shields if the thermocouples are exposed to burner 
radiation.
    For units which employ a draft hood or units which employ a direct 
vent system which does not significantly preheat the incoming combustion 
air, install nine thermocouples, wired in parallel, in a horizontal 
plane located within 12 inches (304.8 mm) of the heater outlet and 
upstream of the draft hood on units so equipped. Locate one thermocouple 
in the center of the pipe and eight thermocouples along imaginary lines 
intersecting at right angles in this horizontal plane at points one 
third and two thirds of the distance between the center of the pipe and 
the pipe wall.
    For units which employ direct vent systems that significantly

mm) of the vent/air intake terminal. Equalize the length of all 
thermocouple leads before paralleling. Locate one thermocouple in the 
center of the vent pipe and eight thermocouples along imaginary lines 
intersecting at right angles in this plane at points one third and two 
thirds of the distance between the center of the flue pipe and the pipe 
wall.
    Use bead-type thermocouples having wire size not greater than No. 24 
American Wire Gauge (AWG). If there is a possibility that the 
thermocouples could receive direct radiation from the fire, install 
radiation shields on the fire side of the thermocouples only and 
position the shields so that they do not touch the thermocouple 
junctions.
    Install thermocouples for measuring conditioned warm air temperature 
as described in ANSI Z21.49-1975, section 2.14. Establish the 
temperature of the inlet air by means of single No. 24 AWG bead-type 
thermocouple, suitably shielded from direct radiation and located in the 
center of the plane of each inlet air opening.
    2.6.2 Oil fueled vented home heating equipment (including direct 
vent systems). Install nine thermocouples, wired in parallel and having 
equal length leads, in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the flue 
pipe. Locate this plane at the position shown in Figure 34.4 of UL 730-
1974, or Figures 35.1 and 35.2 of UL 729-1976 for a single thermocouple, 
except that on direct vent systems which significantly preheat the 
incoming combustion air, it shall be located within 6 inches (152.5 mm) 
of the outlet of the vent/air intake terminal. Locate one thermocouple 
in the center of the flue pipe and eight thermocouples along imaginary 
lines intersecting at right angles in this plane at points one third and 
two thirds of the distance between the center of the pipe and pipe wall.
    Use bead-type thermocouples having a wire size not greater than No. 
24 AWG. If there is a possibility that the thermocouples could receive 
direct radiation from the fire, install radiation shields on the fire 
side of the thermocouples only and position the shields so that they do 
not touch the thermocouple junctions.
    Install thermocouples for measuring the conditioned warm air 
temperature as described in sections 35.12 through 35.17 of UL 730-1974. 
Establish the temperature of the inlet air by means of a single No. 24 
AWG bead-type thermocouple, suitably shielded from direct radiation and 
located in the center of the plane of each inlet air opening.
    2.7 Combustion measurement instrumentation. Analyze the samples of 
stack and flue gases for vented heaters to determine the concentration 
by volume of carbon dioxide present in the dry gas with instrumentation 
which will result in a reading having an accuracy of <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.1 percentage points.
    2.8 Energy flow instrumentation. Install one or more instruments, 
which measure the rate of gas flow or fuel oil supplied to the vented 
heater, and if appropriate, the electrical energy with an error no 
greater than one percent.
    2.9 Room ambient temperature. During the time period required to 
perform all the testing and measurement procedures specified in section 
3.0 of this appendix, maintain the room temperature within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8C) of the value 
T<INF>RA</INF> measured during the steady-state performance test. At no 
time during these tests shall the room temperature exceed 100 [deg]F 
(37.8C) or fall below 65 [deg]F (18.3C).
    Temperature (T<INF>RA</INF>) shall be the arithmetic average 
temperature of the test area, determined by measurement with four No. 24 
AWG bead-type thermocouples with junctions shielded against radiation, 
located approximately at 90-degree positions on a circle circumscribing 
the heater or heater
enclosure under test, in a horizontal plane approximately at the 
vertical midpoint of the appliance or test enclosure, and with the 
junctions approximately 24 inches from sides of the heater or test 
enclosure and located so as not to be affected by other than room air. 
Locate a thermocouple at each elevation of draft relief inlet opening 
and combustion air

[[Page 325]]

inlet opening at a distance of approximately 24 inches from the inlet 
openings. The temperature of the air for combustion and the air for 
draft relief shall not differ more than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F 
from room temperature as measured above.
    2.10 Equipment used to measure mass flow rate in flue and stack. The 
tracer gas chosen for this task should have a density which is less than 
or approximately equal to the density of air. Use a gas unreactive with 
the environment to be encountered. Using instrumentation of either the 
batch or continuous type, measure the concentration of tracer gas with 
an error no greater than 2 percent of the value of the concentration 
measured.

                      3.0 Testing and measurements.

    3.1 Steady-state testing.
    3.1.1 Gas fueled vented home heating equipment (including direct 
vent systems). Set up the vented heater as specified in sections 2.1, 
2.2, and 2.3 of this appendix. The draft diverter shall be in the normal 
open condition and the stack shall not be insulated. (Insulation of the 
stack is no longer required for the vented heater test.) Begin the 
steady-state performance test by operating the burner and the 
circulating air blower, on units so equipped, with the adjustments 
specified by sections 2.4.1 and 2.5 of this appendix, until steady-state 
conditions are attained as indicated by a temperature variation of not 
more than 3 [deg]F (1.7 C) in the stack gas temperature for vented 
heaters equipped with draft diverters or 5 [deg]F (2.8 C) in the flue 
gas temperature for vented heaters equipped with either draft hoods or 
direct vent systems; in three successive readings taken 15 minutes 
apart.
    On units employing draft diverters, measure the room temperature 
(T<INF>RA</INF>) as described in section 2.9 of this appendix and 
measure the steady-state stack gas temperature (T<INF>S,SS</INF>) using 
the nine thermocouples located in the 5 foot test stack as specified in 
section 2.6.1 of this appendix. Secure a sample of the stack gases in 
the plane where T<INF>S,SS</INF> is measured or within 3.5 feet 
downstream of this plane. Determine the concentration by volume of 
carbon dioxide (X<INF>CO2S</INF>) present in the dry stack gas. If the 
location of the gas sampling differs from the temperature measurement 
plane, there shall be no air leaks through the stack between these two 
locations.
    On units employing draft hoods or direct vent systems, measure the 
room temperature (T<INF>RA</INF>) as described in section 2.9 of this 
appendix and measure the steady-state flue gas temperature 
(T<INF>F,SS</INF>), using the nine thermocouples located in the flue 
pipe as described in section 2.6.1 of this appendix. Secure a sample of 
the flue gas in the plane of temperature measurement and determine the 
concentration by volume of CO<INF>2</INF> (X<INF>CO2F</INF>) present in 
dry flue gas. In addition, for units employing draft hoods, secure a 
sample of the stack gas in a horizontal plane in the five foot test 
stack located one foot from the test stack inlet; and determine the 
concentration by volume of CO<INF>2</INF> (X<INF>CO2S</INF>) present in 
dry stack gas.
    Determine the steady-state heat input rate (Q<INF>in</INF>) 
including pilot gas by multiplying the measured higher heating value of 
the test gas by the steady-state gas input rate corrected to standard 
conditions of 60 [deg]F and 30 inches of mercury. Use measured values of 
gas temperature and pressure at the meter and the barometric pressure to 
correct the metered gas flow rate to standard conditions.
    After the above test measurements have been completed on units 
employing draft diverters, secure a sample of the flue gases at the exit 
of the heat exchanger(s) and determine the concentration of 
CO<INF>2</INF> (X<INF>CO2F</INF>) present. In obtaining this sample of 
flue gas, move the sampling probe around or use a sample probe with 
multiple sampling ports in order to assure that an average value is 
obtained for the CO<INF>2</INF> concentration. For units with multiple 
heat exchanger outlets, measure the CO<INF>2</INF> concentration in a 
sample from each outlet to obtain the average CO<INF>2</INF> 
concentration for the unit. A manifold (parallel connected sampling 
tubes) may be used to obtain this sample.
    For heaters with single stage thermostat control (wall mounted 
electric thermostats), determine the steady-state efficiency at the 
maximum fuel input rate as specified in section 2.4 of this appendix.
    For gas fueled vented heaters equipped with either two stage 
thermostats or step-modulating thermostats, determine the steady-state 
efficiency at the maximum fuel input rate, as specified in section 2.4.1 
of this appendix, and at the reduced fuel input rate, as specified in 
section 2.4.1 of this appendix.
    For manually controlled gas fueled vented heaters, with various 
input rates determine the steady-state efficiency at a fuel input rate 
that is within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent of 50 percent of the 
maximum fuel input rate. If the heater is designed to use a control that 
precludes operation at other than maximum output (single firing rate) 
determine the steady state efficiency at the maximum input rate only.
    3.1.2 Oil fueled vented home heating equipment (including direct 
vent systems). Set up and adjust the vented heater as specified in 
sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3.4 of this appendix. Begin the steady-state 
performance test by operating the burner and the circulating air blower, 
on units so equipped, with the adjustments specified by sections 2.4.2 
and 2.5 of this appendix until steady-state conditions are attained as 
indicated by a temperature variation of not more than 5 [deg]F (2.8 C) 
in the flue gas temperature in three successive readings taken 15 
minutes apart.

[[Page 326]]

    Do not allow smoke in the flue, for units equipped with power 
burners, to exceed a No. 1 smoke during the steady-state performance 
test as measured by the procedure described in ANSI standard Z11.182-
1965 (R1971) (ASTM D 2156-65 (1970)). Maintain the average draft over 
the fire and in the breeching during the steady-state performance test 
at that recommended by the manufacturer <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.005 
inches of water gauge.
    Measure the room temperature (T<INF>RA</INF>) as described in 
section 2.9 of this appendix and measure the steady-state flue gas 
temperature (T<INF>F,SS</INF>) using nine thermocouples located in the 
flue pipe as described in section 2.6.2 of this appendix. Secure a 
sample of the flue gas in the plane of temperature measurement and 
determine the concentration by volume of 
CO<INF>2</INF>(X<INF>CO2F</INF>) present in dry flue gas. Measure and 
record the steady-state heat input rate (Q<INF>in</INF>).
    For manually controlled oil fueled vented heaters, determine the 
steady-state efficiency at a fuel input rate that is within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent of 50 percent of the maximum fuel input rate.
    3.1.3 Auxiliary Electric Power Measurement. Allow the auxiliary 
electrical system of a gas or oil vented heater to operate for at least 
five minutes before recording the maximum auxiliary electric power 
measurement from the wattmeter. Record the maximum electric power 
(P<INF>E</INF>) expressed in kilowatts. For vented heaters with 
modulating controls, the recorded (P<INF>E</INF>) shall be maximum 
measured electric power multiplied by the following factor (R). For two 
stage controls, R=1.3. For step modulating controls, R=1.4 when the 
ratio of minimum-to-maximum fuel input is greater than or equal to 0.7, 
R=1.7 when the ratio of minimum-to-maximum fuel input is less than 0.7 
and greater than or equal to 0.5, and R=2.2 when the ratio of minimum-
to-maximum fuel input is less than 0.5.
    3.2 Jacket loss measurement. Conduct a jacket loss test for vented 
floor furnaces. Measure the jacket loss (L<INF>j</INF>) in accordance 
with the ANSI standard Z21.48-1976 section 2.12.
    3.3 Measurement of the off-cycle losses for vented heaters equipped 
with thermal stack dampers. Install the thermal stack damper according 
to the manufacturer's instructions. Unless specified otherwise, the 
thermal stack damper should be at the draft diverter exit collar. Attach 
a five foot length of bare stack to the outlet of the damper. Install 
thermocouples as specified in section 2.6.1 of this appendix.
    For vented heaters equipped with single stage thermostats, measure 
the off-cycle losses at the maximum fuel input rate. For vented heaters 
equipped with two stage thermostats, measure the off-cycle losses at the 
maximum fuel input rate and at the reduced fuel input rate. For vented 
heaters equipped with step-modulating thermostats, measure the off-cycle 
losses at the reduced fuel input rate.
    Let the vented heater heat up to a steady-state condition. Feed a 
tracer gas at a constant metered rate into the stack directly above and 
within one foot above the stack damper. Record tracer gas flow rate and 
temperature. Measure the tracer gas concentration in the stack at 
several locations in a horizontal plane through a cross section of the 
stack at a point sufficiently above the stack damper to ensure that the 
tracer gas is well mixed in the stack.
    Continuously measure the tracer gas concentration and temperature 
during a 10 minute cool down period. Shut the burner off and immediately 
begin measuring tracer gas concentration in the stack, stack 
temperature, room temperature, and barometric pressure. Record these 
values as the midpoint of each one-minute interval between burner shut 
down and ten minutes after burner shut down. Meter response time and 
sampling delay time shall be considered in timing these measurements.
    3.4 Measurement of the effectiveness of electro-mechanical stack 
dampers. For vented heaters equipped with electro-mechanical stack 
dampers, measure the cross sectional area of the stack (A<INF>s</INF>), 
the net area of the damper plate (A<INF>o</INF>), and the angle that the 
damper plate makes when closed with a plane perpendicular to the axis of 
the stack ([Omega]). The net area of the damper plate means the area of 
the damper plate minus the area of any holes through the damper plate.
    3.5 Pilot light measurement.
    3.5.1 Measure the energy input rate to the pilot light 
(Q<INF>P</INF>) with an error no greater than 3 percent for vented 
heaters so equipped.
    3.5.2 For manually controlled heaters where the pilot light is 
designed to be turned off by the user when the heater is not in use, 
that is, turning the control to the OFF position will shut off the gas 
supply to the burner(s) and to the pilot light, the measurement of 
Q<INF>P</INF> is not needed. This provision applies only if an 
instruction to turn off the unit is provided on the heater near the gas 
control valve (e.g. by label) by the manufacturer.

    3.6 Optional procedure for determining D<INF>p'</INF> D<INF>F'</INF> 
and D<INF>s</INF> for systems for all types of vented heaters. For all 
types of vented heaters, D<INF>p'</INF> D<INF>F'</INF> and D<INF>S</INF> 
can be measured by the following optional cool down test.
    Conduct a cool down test by letting the unit heat up until steady-
state conditions are reached, as indicated by temperature variation of 
not more than 5 [deg]F (2.8 [deg]C) in the flue gas temperature in three 
successive readings taken 15 minutes apart, and then shutting the unit 
off with the stack or flue damper controls by-passed or adjusted so that 
the stack or flue damper remains open during the resulting cool down 
period. If a

[[Page 327]]

draft was maintained on oil fueled units in the flue pipe during the 
steady-state performance test described in section 3.1 of this appendix, 
maintain the same draft (within a range of -.001 to +.005 inches of 
water gauge of the average steady-state draft) during this cool down 
period.
    Measure the flue gas mass flow rate (m<INF>F,OFF</INF>) during the 
cool down test described above at a specific off-period flue gas 
temperature and corrected to obtain its value at the steady-state flue 
gas temperature (T<INF>F,SS</INF>), using the procedure described below.
    Within one minute after the unit is shut off to start the cool down 
test for determining D<INF>F</INF>, begin feeding a tracer gas into the 
combustion chamber at a constant flow rate of V<INF>T</INF>, and at a 
point which will allow for the best possible mixing with the air flowing 
through the chamber. (On units equipped with an oil fired power burner, 
the best location for injecting this tracer gas appears to be through a 
hole drilled in the air tube.) Periodically measure the value of 
V<INF>T</INF> with an instantaneously reading flow meter having an 
accuracy of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3 percent of the quantity measured. 
Maintain V<INF>T</INF> at less than 1 percent of the air flow rate 
through the furnace. If a combustible tracer gas is used, there should 
be a delay period between the time the burner gas is shut off and the 
time the tracer gas is first injected to prevent ignition of the tracer 
gas.
    Between 5 and 6 minutes after the unit is shut off to start the cool 
down test, measure at the exit of the heat exchanger the average flue 
gas temperature, T*<INF>F,Off</INF>. At the same instant the flue gas 
temperature is measured, also measure the percent volumetric 
concentration of tracer gas C<INF>T</INF> in the flue gas in the same 
plane where T*<INF>F,Off</INF> is determined. Obtain the concentration 
of tracer gas using an instrument which will result in an accuracy of 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent in the value of C<INF>T</INF> measured. 
If use of a continuous reading type instrument results in a delay time 
between drawing of a sample and its analysis, this delay should be taken 
into account so that the temperature measurement and the measurement of 
tracer gas concentration coincide. In addition, determine the 
temperature of the tracer gas entering the flow meter (T<INF>T</INF>) 
and the barometric pressure (P<INF>B</INF>).
    The rate of the flue gas mass flow through the vented heater and the 
factors D<INF>P</INF>, D<INF>F</INF>, and D<INF>S</INF> are calculated 
by the equations in sections 4.5.1 through 4.5.3 of this appendix.

                              1. Objectives

    This Appendix establishes procedures, interpretations and policies 
to guide the DOE in the consideration and promulgation of new or revised 
appliance efficiency standards under the Energy Policy and Conservation 
Act (EPCA). The Department's objectives in establishing these guidelines 
include:
    (a) Provide for early input from stakeholders. The Department seeks 
to provide opportunities for public input early in the rulemaking 
process so that the initiation and direction of rulemakings is informed 
by comment from interested parties. Under the guidelines established by 
this Appendix, DOE will seek early input from interested parties in 
setting rulemaking priorities and structuring the analyses for 
particular products. Interested parties will be invited to provide input 
for the selection of design options and will help DOE identify analysis, 
data, and modeling needs. DOE will gather input from interested parties 
through a variety of mechanisms, including public workshops.
    (b) Increase predictability of the rulemaking timetable. The 
Department seeks to make informed, strategic decisions about how to 
deploy its resources on the range of possible

[[Page 357]]

standards development activities, and to announce these prioritization 
decisions so that all interested parties have a common expectation about 
the timing of different rulemaking activities. The guidelines in this 
Appendix provide for setting priorities and timetables for standards 
development and test procedure modification and reflect these priorities 
in the Regulatory Agenda.
    (c) Increase use of outside technical expertise. The Department 
seeks to expand its use of outside technical experts in evaluating 
product-specific engineering issues to ensure that decisions on 
technical issues are fully informed. The guidelines in this Appendix 
provide for increased use of outside technical experts in developing, 
performing and reviewing the analyses. Draft analytical results will be 
distributed for peer and stakeholder review.
    (d) Eliminate problematic design options early in the process. The 
Department seeks to eliminate from consideration, early in the process, 
any design options that present unacceptable problems with respect to 
manufacturability, consumer utility, or safety, so that the detailed 
analysis can focus only on viable design options. Under the guidelines 
in this Appendix, DOE will eliminate from consideration design options 
if it concludes that manufacture, installation or service of the design 
will be impractical, or that the design option will adversely affect the 
utility of the product, or if the design has adverse safety or health 
impacts. This screening will be done at the outset of a rulemaking.
    (e) Fully consider non-regulatory approaches. The Department seeks 
to understand the effects of market forces and voluntary programs on 
encouraging the purchase of energy efficient products so that the 
incremental impacts of a new or revised standard can be accurately 
assessed and the Department can make informed decisions about where 
standards and voluntary ``market pull'' programs can be used most 
effectively. Under the guidelines in this Appendix, DOE will solicit 
information on the effectiveness of market forces and non-regulatory 
approaches for encouraging the purchase of energy efficient products, 
and will carefully consider this information in assessing the benefits 
of standards. In addition, DOE will continue to support voluntary 
efforts by manufacturers, retailers, utilities and others to increase 
product efficiency.
    (f) Conduct thorough analysis of impacts. In addition to 
understanding the aggregate costs and benefits of standards, the 
Department seeks to understand the distribution of those costs and 
benefits among consumers, manufacturers and others, and the uncertainty 
associated with these analyses of costs and benefits, so that any 
adverse impacts on significant subgroups and uncertainty concerning any 
adverse impacts can be fully considered in selecting a standard. Under 
the guidelines in this Appendix, the analyses will consider the 
variability of impacts on significant groups of manufacturers and 
consumers in addition to aggregate costs and benefits, report the range 
of uncertainty associated with these impacts, and take into account 
cumulative impacts of regulation on manufacturers.
    (g) Use transparent and robust analytical methods. The Department 
seeks to use qualitative and quantitative analytical methods that are 
fully documented for the public and that produce results that can be 
explained and reproduced, so that the analytical underpinnings for 
policy decisions on standards are as sound and well-accepted as 
possible. Under the guidelines in this Appendix, DOE will solicit input 
from interested parties in identifying analysis, data, and modeling 
needs with respect to measurement of impacts on manufacturers and 
consumers.
    (h) Articulate policies to guide selection of standards. The 
Department seeks to adopt policies elaborating on the statutory criteria 
for selecting standards, so that interested parties are aware of the 
policies that will guide these decisions. Under the guidelines in this 
Appendix, policies for screening design options, selecting candidate 
standard levels, selecting a proposed standard level, and establishing 
the final standard are established.
    (i) Support efforts to build consensus on standards. The Department 
seeks to encourage development of consensus proposals for new or revised 
standards because standards with such broad-based support are likely to 
balance effectively the economic, energy, and environmental interests 
affected by standards. Under the guidelines in this Appendix, DOE will 
support the development and submission of consensus recommendations for 
standards by representative groups of interested parties to the fullest 
extent possible.
    (j) Reduce time and cost of developing standards. The Department 
seeks to establish a clear protocol for initiating and conducting 
standards rulemakings in order to eliminate time-consuming and costly 
missteps. Under the guidelines in this Appendix, increased and earlier 
involvement by interested parties and increased use of technical experts 
should minimize the need for re-analysis. This process should reduce the 
period between the publication of an Advance Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (ANOPR) and the publication of a final rule to not more than 
18 months, and should decrease the government and private sector 
resources required to complete the standard development process.

[[Page 358]]

                                2. Scope

    (a) The procedures, interpretations and policies described in this 
Appendix will be fully applicable to:
    (1) Rulemakings concerning new or revised Federal energy 
conservation standards for consumer products initiated after August 14, 
1996, and
    (2) Rulemakings concerning new or revised Federal energy 
conservation standards for consumer products that have been initiated 
but for which a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) has not been 
published as of August 14, 1996.
    (b) For rulemakings described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, 
to the extent analytical work has already been done or public comment on 
an ANOPR has already been provided, such analyses and comment will be 
considered, as appropriate, in proceeding under the new process.
    (c) With respect to incomplete rulemakings concerning new or revised 
Federal energy conservation standards for consumer products for which a 
NOPR was published prior to August 14, 1996, the Department will conduct 
a case-by-case review to decide whether any of the analytical or 
procedural steps already completed should be repeated. In any case, the 
approach described in this Appendix will be used to the extent possible 
to conduct any analytical or procedural steps that have not been 
completed.

              3. Setting Priorities for Rulemaking Activity

    (a) Priority-setting analysis and development of list of priorities. 
At least once a year, the Department will prepare an analysis of each of 
the factors identified in paragraph (d) of this section based on 
existing literature, direct communications with interested parties and 
other experts, and other available information. The results of this 
analysis will be used to develop rulemaking priorities and proposed 
schedules for the development and issuance of all rulemakings. The DOE 
analysis, priorities and proposed rulemaking schedules will be 
documented and distributed for review and comment.
    (b) Public review and comment. Each year, DOE will invite public 
input to review and comment on the priority analysis.
    (c) Issuance of final listing of rulemaking priorities. Each fall, 
the Department will issue, simultaneously with the issuance of the 
Administration's Regulatory Agenda, a final set of rulemaking 
priorities, the accompanying analysis, and the schedules for all 
priority rulemakings that it anticipates within the next two years.
    (d) Factors for priority-setting. The factors to be considered by 
DOE in developing priorities and establishing schedules for conducting 
rulemakings will include:
    (1) Potential energy savings.
    (2) Potential economic benefits.
    (3) Potential environmental or energy security benefits.
    (4) Applicable deadlines for rulemakings.
    (5) Incremental DOE resources required to complete rulemaking 
process.
    (6) Other relevant regulatory actions affecting products.
    (7) Stakeholder recommendations.
    (8) Evidence of energy efficiency gains in the market absent new or 
revised standards.
    (9) Status of required changes to test procedures.
    (10) Other relevant factors.

    4. Process for Developing Efficiency Standards and Factors to be 
                               Considered

    This section describes the process to be used in developing 
efficiency standards and the factors to be considered in the process. 
The policies of the Department to guide the selection of standards and 
the decisions preliminary thereto are described in section 5.
    (a) Identifying and screening design options. Once the Department 
has initiated a rulemaking for a specific product but before publishing 
an ANOPR, DOE will identify the product categories and design options to 
be analyzed in detail, and identify those design options eliminated from 
further consideration. Interested parties will be consulted to identify 
key issues, develop a list of design options, and to help the Department 
identify the expertise necessary to conduct the analysis.
    (1) Identification of issues for analysis. The Department, in 
consultation with interested parties, will identify issues that will be 
examined in the standards development process.
    (2) Identification of experts and other interested parties for peer 
review. DOE, in consultation with interested parties, will identify a 
group of independent experts and other interested parties who can 
provide expert review of the results of the engineering analysis and the 
subsequent impact analysis.
    (3) Identification and screening of design options. In consultation 
with interested parties, the Department will develop a list of design 
options for consideration. Initially, the candidate design options will 
encompass all those technologies considered to be technologically 
feasible. Following the development of this initial list of design 
options, DOE will review each design option based on the factors 
described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section and the policies stated in 
section 5(b). The reasons for eliminating any design option at this 
stage of the process will be fully documented and published as part of 
the ANOPR. The technologically feasible design options that are not 
eliminated in this screening will be considered further in the 
Engineering Analysis described in paragraph (b) of this section.

[[Page 359]]

    (4) Factors for screening of design options. The factors for 
screening design options include:
    (i) Technological feasibility. Technologies incorporated in 
commercial products or in working prototypes will be considered 
technologically feasible.
    (ii) Practicability to manufacture, install and service. If mass 
production of a technology in commercial products and reliable 
installation and servicing of the technology could be achieved on the 
scale necessary to serve the relevant market at the time of the 
effective date of the standard, then that technology will be considered 
practicable to manufacture, install and service.
    (iii) Adverse Impacts on Product Utility or Product Availability.
    (iv) Adverse Impacts on Health or Safety.
    (5) Selection of contractors. Using the specifications of necessary 
contractor expertise developed in consultation with interested parties, 
DOE will select appropriate contractors, subcontractors, and as 
necessary, expert consultants to perform the engineering analysis and 
the impact analysis.
    (b) Engineering analysis of design options and selection of 
candidate standard levels. After design options are identified and 
screened, DOE will perform the engineering analysis and the benefit/cost 
analysis and select the candidate standard levels based on these 
analyses. The results of the analyses will be published in a Technical 
Support Document (TSD) to accompany the ANOPR.
    (1) Identification of engineering analytical methods and tools. DOE, 
in consultation with outside experts, will select the specific 
engineering analysis tools (or multiple tools, if necessary to address 
uncertainty) to be used in the analysis of the design options identified 
as a result of the screening analysis.
    (2) Engineering and life-cycle cost analysis of design options. The 
DOE and its contractor will perform engineering and life-cycle cost 
analyses of the design options.
    (3) Review by expert group and stakeholders. The results of the 
engineering and life-cycle cost analyses will be distributed for review 
by experts and interested parties. If appropriate, a public workshop 
will be conducted to review these results. The analyses will be revised 
as appropriate on the basis of this input.
    (4) New information relating to the factors used for screening 
design options. If further information or analysis leads to a 
determination that a design option, or a combination of design options, 
has unacceptable impacts based on the policies stated in section 5(b), 
that design option or combination of design options will not be included 
in a candidate standard level.
    (5) Selection of candidate standard levels. Based on the results of 
the engineering and life-cycle cost analysis of design options and the 
policies stated in section 5(c), DOE will select the candidate standard 
levels for further analysis.
    (c) Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking--(1) Documentation of 
decisions on candidate standard selection. (i) If the screening analysis 
indicates that continued development of a standard is appropriate, the 
Department will publish an ANOPR in the Federal Register and will 
distribute a draft TSD containing the analyses performed to this point. 
The ANOPR will specify candidate standard levels but will not propose a 
particular standard. The ANOPR will also include the preliminary 
analysis of consumer life-cycle costs, national net present value, and 
energy impacts for the candidate standard levels based on the 
engineering analysis.
    (ii) If the preliminary analysis indicates that no candidate 
standard level is likely to meet the criteria specified in law, that 
conclusion will be announced. In such cases, the Department may decide 
to proceed with a rulemaking that proposes not to adopt new or amended 
standards, or it may suspend the rulemaking and conclude that further 
action on such standards should be assigned a low priority under section 
3.
    (2) Public comment and hearing. There will be 75 days for public 
comment on the ANOPR with at least one public hearing or workshop.
    (3) Revisions based on comments. Based on consideration of the 
comments received, any necessary changes to the engineering analysis or 
the candidate standard levels will be made.
    If major changes are required at this stage, interested parties and 
experts will be given an opportunity to review the revised analysis.
    (d) Analysis of impacts and selection of proposed standard level. 
After the ANOPR, economic analyses of the impacts of the candidate 
standard levels will be conducted. The Department will propose updated 
standards based on the results of the impact analysis.
    (1) Identification of issues for analysis. The Department, in 
consultation with interested parties, will identify issues that will be 
examined in the impacts analysis.
    (2) Identification of analytical methods and tools. DOE, in 
consultation with outside experts, will select the specific economic 
analysis tools (or multiple tools if necessary to address uncertainty) 
to be used in the analysis of the candidate standard levels.
    (3) Analysis of impacts. DOE will conduct the analysis of the 
impacts of candidate standard levels including analysis of the factors 
described in paragraphs (d)(7)(ii)-(viii) of this section.
    (4) Review by expert group and stakeholders. The results of the 
analysis of impacts will be

[[Page 360]]

distributed for review by experts and interested parties. If 
appropriate, a public workshop will be conducted to review these 
results. The analysis will be revised as appropriate on the basis of 
this input.
    (5) Efforts to develop consensus among stakeholders. If a 
representative group of interested parties undertakes to develop joint 
recommendations to the Department on standards, DOE will consider 
deferring its impact analysis until these discussions are completed or 
until participants in the efforts indicate that they are unable to reach 
a timely agreement.
    (6) Selection of proposed standard level based on analysis of 
impacts. On the basis of the analysis of the factors described in 
paragraph (d)(7) of this section and the policies stated in section 
5(e), DOE will select a proposed standard level.
    (7) Factors to be considered in selecting a proposed standard. The 
factors to be considered in selection of a proposed standard include:
    (i) Consensus stakeholder recommendations.
    (ii) Impacts on manufacturers. The analysis of manufacturer impacts 
will include: Estimated impacts on cash flow; assessment of impacts on 
manufacturers of specific categories of products and small 
manufacturers; assessment of impacts on manufacturers of multiple 
product-specific Federal regulatory requirements, including efficiency 
standards for other products and regulations of other agencies; and 
impact on manufacturing capacity, plant closures, and loss of capital 
investment.
    (iii) Impacts on consumers. The analysis of consumer impacts will 
include: Estimated impacts on consumers based on national average energy 
prices and energy usage; assessments of impacts on subgroups of 
consumers based on major regional differences in usage or energy prices 
and significant variations in installation costs or performance; 
sensitivity analyses using high and low discount rates and high and low 
energy price forecasts; consideration of changes to product utility and 
other impacts of likely concern to all or some consumers, based to the 
extent practicable on direct input from consumers; estimated life-cycle 
cost with sensitivity analysis; and consideration of the increased first 
cost to consumers and the time required for energy cost savings to pay 
back these first costs.
    (iv) Impacts on competition.
    (v) Impacts on utilities. The analysis of utility impacts will 
include estimated marginal impacts on electric and gas utility costs and 
revenues.
    (vi) National energy, economic and employment impacts. The analysis 
of national energy, economic and employment impacts will include: 
Estimated energy savings by fuel type; estimated net present value of 
benefits to all consumers; and estimates of the direct and indirect 
impacts on employment by appliance manufacturers, relevant service 
industries, energy suppliers and the economy in general.
    (vii) Impacts on the environment and energy security. The analysis 
of environmental and energy security impacts will include estimated 
impacts on emissions of carbon and relevant criteria pollutants, impacts 
on pollution control costs, and impacts on oil use.
    (viii) Impacts of non-regulatory approaches. The analysis of energy 
savings and consumer impacts will incorporate an assessment of the 
impacts of market forces and existing voluntary programs in promoting 
product efficiency, usage and related characteristics in the absence of 
updated efficiency standards.
    (ix) New information relating to the factors used for screening 
design options.
    (e) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking--(1) Documentation of decisions on 
proposed standard selection. The Department will publish a NOPR in the 
Federal Register that proposes standard levels and explains the basis 
for the selection of those proposed levels, and will distribute a draft 
TSD documenting the analysis of impacts. As required by Sec. 325(p)(2) 
of EPCA, the NOPR also will describe the maximum improvement in energy 
efficiency or maximum reduction in energy use that is technologically 
feasible and, if the proposed standards would not achieve these levels, 
the reasons for proposing different standards.
    (2) Public comment and hearing. There will be 75 days for public 
comment on the NOPR, with at least one public hearing or workshop.
    (3) Revisions to impact analyses and selection of final standard. 
Based on the public comments received and the policies stated in section 
5(f), DOE will review the proposed standard and impact analyses, and 
make modifications as necessary. If major changes to the analyses are 
required at this stage, interested parties and experts will be given an 
opportunity to review the revised analyses.
    (f) Notice of Final Rulemaking. The Department will publish a Notice 
of Final Rulemaking in the Federal Register that promulgates standard 
levels and explains the basis for the selection of those standards, 
accompanied by a final TSD.

                 5. Policies on Selection of Standards.

    (a) Purpose. (1) Section 4 describes the process that will be used 
to consider new or revised energy efficiency standards and lists a 
number of factors and analyses that will be considered at specified 
points in the process. Department policies co12467ncerning the selection 
of new or revised standards, and decisions preliminary thereto, are 
described in this section.
    These policies are intended to elaborate on the statutory criteria 
provided in section 325 of the EPCA, 42 U.S.C. 6295.

[[Page 361]]

    (2) The policies described below are intended to provide guidance 
for making the determinations required by EPCA. This statement of policy 
is not intended to preclude consideration of any information pertinent 
to the statutory criteria. The Department will consider all pertinent 
information in determining whether a new or revised standard is 
consistent with the statutory criteria. Moreover, the Department will 
not be guided by a policy in this section if, in the particular 
circumstances presented, such a policy would lead to a result 
inconsistent with the criteria in section 325 of EPCA.
    (b) Screening design options. Section 4(a)(4) lists factors to be 
considered in screening design options. These factors will be considered 
as follows in determining whether a design option will receive any 
further consideration:
    (1) Technological feasibility. Technologies that are not 
incorporated in commercial products or in working prototypes will not be 
considered further.
    (2) Practicability to manufacture, install and service. If it is 
determined that mass production of a technology in commercial products 
and reliable installation and servicing of the technology could not be 
achieved on the scale necessary to serve the relevant market at the time 
of the effective date of the standard, then that technology will not be 
considered further.
    (3) Impacts on product utility to consumers. If a technology is 
determined to have significant adverse impact on the utility of the 
product to significant subgroups of consumers, or result in the 
unavailability of any covered product type with performance 
characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, 
and volumes that are substantially the same as products generally 
available in the U.S. at the time, it will not be considered further.
    (4) Safety of technologies. If it is determined that a technology 
will have significant adverse impacts on health or safety, it will not 
be considered further.
    (c) Identification of candidate standard levels. Based on the 
results of the engineering and cost and benefit analyses of design 
options, DOE will identify the candidate standard levels for further 
analysis. Candidate standard levels will be selected as follows:
    (1) Costs and savings of design options. Design options which have 
payback periods that exceed the average life of the product or which 
cause life-cycle cost increases relative to the base case, using typical 
fuel costs, usage and discount rates, will not be used as the basis for 
candidate standard levels.
    (2) Further information on factors used for screening design 
options. If further information or analysis leads to a determination 
that a design option, or a combination of design options, has 
unacceptable impacts under the policies stated in paragraph (b) of this 
section, that design option or combination of design options will not be 
included in a candidate standard level.
    (3) Selection of candidate standard levels. Candidate standard 
levels, which will be identified in the ANOPR and on which impact 
analyses will be conducted, will be based on the remaining design 
options.
    (i) The range of candidate standard levels will typically include:
    (A) The most energy efficient combination of design options;
    (B) The combination of design options with the lowest life-cycle 
cost; and
    (C) A combination of design options with a payback period of not 
more than three years.
    (ii) Candidate standard levels that incorporate noteworthy 
technologies or fill in large gaps between efficiency levels of other 
candidate standard levels also may be selected.
    (d) Advance notice of proposed rulemaking. New information provided 
in public comments on the ANOPR will be considered to determine whether 
any changes to the candidate standard levels are needed before 
proceeding to the analysis of impacts. This review, and any appropriate 
adjustments, will be based on the policies in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (e) Selection of proposed standard. Based on the results of the 
analysis of impacts, DOE will select a standard level to be proposed for 
public comment in the NOPR. Section 4(d)(7) lists the factors to be 
considered in selecting a proposed standard level. Section 325(o)(2)(A) 
of EPCA provides that any new or revised standard must be designed to 
achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency that is determined 
to be technologically feasible and economically justified.
    (1) Statutory policies. The fundamental policies concerning 
selection of standards are established in the EPCA, including the 
following:
    (i) A candidate standard level will not be proposed or promulgated 
if the Department determines that it is not technologically feasible and 
economically justified. See EPCA section 325(o)(3)(B). A standard level 
is economically justified if the benefits exceed the burdens. See EPCA 
section 325(o)(2)(B)(i). A standard level is rebuttably presumed to be 
economically justified if the payback period is three years or less. See 
EPCA section 325(o)(2)(B)(iii).
    (ii) If the Department determines that a standard level is likely to 
result in the unavailability of any covered product type with 
performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, 
capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as products 
generally available in the U.S. at the time, that standard level will 
not be proposed. See EPCA section 325(o)(4).

[[Page 362]]

    (iii) If the Department determines that a standard level would not 
result in significant conservation of energy, that standard level will 
not be proposed. See EPCA section 325(o)(3)(B).
    (2) Selection of proposed standard on the basis of consensus 
stakeholder recommendations. Development of consensus proposals for new 
or revised standards is an effective mechanism for balancing the 
economic, energy, and environmental interests affected by standards. 
Thus, notwithstanding any other policy on selection of proposed 
standards, a consensus recommendation on an updated efficiency level 
submitted by a group that represents all interested parties will be 
proposed by the Department if it is determined to meet the statutory 
criteria.
    (3) Considerations in assessing economic justification.
    (i) The following policies will guide the application of the 
economic justification criterion in selecting a proposed standard:
    (A) If the Department determines that a candidate standard level 
would result in a negative return on investment for the industry, would 
significantly reduce the value of the industry, or would cause 
significant adverse impacts to a significant subgroup of manufacturers 
(including small manufacturing businesses), that standard level will be 
presumed not to be economically justified unless the Department 
determines that specifically identified expected benefits of the 
standard would outweigh this and any other expected adverse effects.
    (B) If the Department determines that a candidate standard level 
would be the direct cause of plant closures, significant losses in 
domestic manufacturer employment, or significant losses of capital 
investment by domestic manufacturers, that standard level will be 
presumed not to be economically justified unless the Department 
determines that specifically identified expected benefits of the 
standard would outweigh this and any other expected adverse effects.
    (C) If the Department determines that a candidate standard level 
would have a significant adverse impact on the environment or energy 
security, that standard level will be presumed not to be economically 
justified unless the Department determines that specifically identified 
expected benefits of the standard would outweigh this and any other 
expected adverse effects.
    (D) If the Department determines that a candidate standard level 
would not result in significant energy conservation relative to non-
regulatory approaches, that standard level will be presumed not to be 
economically justified unless the Department determines that other 
specifically identified expected benefits of the standard would outweigh 
the expected adverse effects.
    (E) If the Department determines that a candidate standard level is 
not consistent with the policies relating to practicability to 
manufacture, consumer utility, or safety in paragraphs (b) (2), (3) and 
(4) of this section, that standard level will be presumed not to be 
economically justified unless the Department determines that 
specifically identified expected benefits of the standard would outweigh 
this and any other expected adverse effects.
    (F) If the Department determines that a candidate standard level is 
not consistent with the policies relating to consumer costs in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, that standard level will be presumed not to be 
economically justified unless the Department determines that 
specifically identified expected benefits of the standard would outweigh 
this and any other expected adverse effects.
    (G) If the Department determines that a candidate standard level 
will have significant adverse impacts on a significant subgroup of 
consumers (including low-income consumers), that standard level will be 
presumed not to be economically justified unless the Department 
determines that specifically identified expected benefits of the 
standard would outweigh this and any other expected adverse effects.
    (H) If the Department or the Department of Justice determines that a 
candidate standard level would have significant anticompetitive effects, 
that standard level will be presumed not to be economically justified 
unless the Department determines that specifically identified expected 
benefits of the standard would outweigh this and any other expected 
adverse effects.
    (ii) The basis for a determination that triggers any presumption in 
paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section and the basis for a determination 
that an applicable presumption has been rebutted will be supported by 
substantial evidence in the record and the evidence and rationale for 
making these determinations will be explained in the NOPR.
    (iii) If none of the policies in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section 
is found to be dispositive, the Department will determine whether the 
benefits of a candidate standard level exceed the burdens considering 
all the pertinent information in the record.
    (f) Selection of a final standard. New information provided in the 
public comments on the NOPR and any analysis by the Department of 
Justice concerning impacts on competition of the proposed standard will 
be considered to determine whether any change to the proposed standard 
level is needed before proceeding to the final rule. The same policies 
used to select the proposed standard level, as described in section 5(e) 
above, will be used to guide the selection of the final standard level.

[[Page 363]]

                     6. Effective Date of a Standard

    The effective date for new or revised standards will be established 
so that the period between the publication of the final rule and the 
effective date is not less than any period between the dates for 
publication and effective date provided for in EPCA. The effective date 
of any revised standard will be established so that the period between 
the effective date of the prior standard and the effective date of such 
revised standard is not less than period between the two effective dates 
provided for in EPCA.

                           7. Test Procedures

    (a) Identifying the need to modify test procedures. DOE, in 
consultation with interested parties, experts, and the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology, will attempt to identify any 
necessary modifications to established test procedures when initiating 
the standards development process.
    (b) Developing and proposing revised test procedures. Needed 
modifications to test procedures will be identified in consultation with 
experts and interested parties early in the screening stage of the 
standards development process. Any necessary modifications will be 
proposed before issuance of an ANOPR in the standards development 
process.
    (c) Issuing final test procedure modification. Final, modified test 
procedures will be issued prior to the NOPR on proposed standards.
    (d) Effective date of modified test procedures. If required only for 
the evaluation and issuance of updated efficiency standards, modified 
test procedures typically will not go into effect until the effective 
date of updated standards.

                  8. Joint Stakeholder Recommendations

    (a) Joint recommendations. Consensus recommendations, and supporting 
analyses, submitted by a representative group of interested parties will 
be given substantial weight by DOE in the development of a proposed 
rule. See section 5(e)(2). If the supporting analyses provided by the 
group addresses all of the statutory criteria and uses valid economic 
assumptions and analytical methods, DOE expects to use this supporting 
analyses as the basis of a proposed rule. The proposed rule will explain 
any deviations from the consensus recommendations from interested 
parties.
    (b) Breadth of participation. Joint recommendations will be of most 
value to the Department if the participants are reasonably 
representative of those interested in the outcome of the standards 
development process, including manufacturers, consumers, utilities, 
states and representatives of environmental or energy efficiency 
interest groups.
    (c) DOE support of consensus development, including impact analyses. 
In order to facilitate such consensus development, DOE will make 
available, upon request, appropriate technical and legal support to the 
group and will provide copies of all relevant public documents and 
analyses. The Department also will consider any requests for its active 
participation in such discussions, recognizing that the procedural 
requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act may apply to such 
participation.

          9. Principles for the Conduct of Engineering Analysis

    (a) The purpose of the engineering analysis is to develop the 
relationship between efficiency and cost of the subject product. The 
Department will use the most appropriate means available to determine 
the efficiency/cost relationship, including an overall system approach 
or engineering modeling to predict the improvement in efficiency that 
can be expected from individual design options as discussed in the 
paragraphs below. From this efficiency/cost relationship, measures such 
as payback, life cycle cost, and energy savings can be developed. The 
Department, in consultation with interested parties, will identify 
issues that will be examined in the engineering analysis and the types 
of specialized expertise that may be required. With these 
specifications, DOE will select appropriate contractors, subcontractors, 
and expert consultants, as necessary, to perform the engineering 
analysis and the impact analysis. Also, the Department will consider 
data, information and analyses received from interested parties for use 
in the analysis wherever feasible.
    (b) The engineering analysis begins with the list of design options 
developed in consultation with the interested parties as a result of the 
screening process. In consultation with the technology/industry expert 
peer review group, the Department will establish the likely cost and 
performance improvement of each design option. Ranges and uncertainties 
of cost and performance will be established, although efforts will be 
made to minimize uncertainties by using measures such as test data or 
component or material supplier information where available. Estimated 
uncertainties will be carried forward in subsequent analyses. The use of 
quantitative models will be supplemented by qualitative assessments as 
appropriate.
    (c) The next step includes identifying, modifying or developing any 
engineering models necessary to predict the efficiency impact of any one 
or combination of design options on the product. A base case 
configuration or starting point will be established as well as the order 
and combination/blending of the design options to be evaluated. The DOE, 
utilizing expert consultants, will

[[Page 364]]

then perform the engineering analysis and develop the cost efficiency 
curve for the product. The cost efficiency curve and any necessary 
models will be subject to peer review before being issued with the 
ANOPR.

       10. Principles for the Analysis of Impacts on Manufacturers

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of the manufacturer analysis is to identify 
the likely impacts of efficiency standards on manufacturers. The 
Department will analyze the impact of standards on manufacturers with 
substantial input from manufacturers and other interested parties. The 
use of quantitative models will be supplemented by qualitative 
assessments by industry experts. This section describes the principles 
that will be used in conducting future manufacturing impact analysis.
    (b) Issue identification. In the impact analysis stage (section 
4(d)), the Department, in consultation with interested parties, will 
identify issues that will require greater consideration in the detailed 
manufacturer impact analysis. Possible issues may include identification 
of specific types or groups of manufacturers and concerns over access to 
technology. Specialized contractor expertise, empirical data 
requirements, and analytical tools required to perform the manufacturer 
impact analysis also would be identified at this stage.
    (c) Industry characterization. Prior to initiating detailed impact 
studies, the Department will seek input on the present and past industry 
structure and market characteristics. Input on the following issues will 
be sought:
    (1) Manufacturers and their relative market shares;
    (2) Manufacturer characteristics, such as whether manufacturers make 
a full line of models or serve a niche market;
    (3) Trends in the number of manufacturers;
    (4) Financial situation of manufacturers;
    (5) Trends in product characteristics and retail markets; and
    (6) Identification of other relevant regulatory actions and a 
description of the nature and timing of any likely impacts.
    (d) Cost impacts on manufacturers. The costs of labor, material, 
engineering, tooling, and capital are difficult to estimate, 
manufacturer-specific, and usually proprietary. The Department will seek 
input from interested parties on the treatment of cost issues. 
Manufacturers will be encouraged to offer suggestions as to possible 
sources of data and appropriate data collection methodologies. Costing 
issues to be addressed include:
    (1) Estimates of total cost impacts, including product-specific 
costs (based on cost impacts estimated for the engineering analysis) and 
front-end investment/conversion costs for the full range of product 
models.
    (2) Range of uncertainties in estimates of average cost, considering 
alternative designs and technologies which may vary cost impacts and 
changes in costs of material, labor and other inputs which may vary 
costs.
    (3) Variable cost impacts on particular types of manufacturers, 
considering factors such as atypical sunk costs or characteristics of 
specific models which may increase or decrease costs.
    (e) Impacts on product sales, features, prices and cost recovery. In 
order to make manufacturer cash flow calculations, it is necessary to 
predict the number of products sold and their sale price. This requires 
an assessment of the likely impacts of price changes on the number of 
products sold and on typical features of models sold. Past analyses have 
relied on price and shipment data generated by economic models. The 
Department will develop additional estimates of prices and shipments by 
drawing on multiple sources of data and experience including: actual 
shipment and pricing experience, data from manufacturers, retailers and 
other market experts, financial models, and sensitivity analyses. The 
possible impacts of candidate standard levels on consumer choices among 
competing fuels will be explicitly considered where relevant.
    (f) Measures of impact. The manufacturer impact analysis will 
estimate the impacts of candidate standard levels on the net cash flow 
of manufacturers. Computations will be performed for the industry as a 
whole and for typical and atypical manufacturers. The exact nature and 
the process by which the analysis will be conducted will be determined 
by DOE, in conjunction with interested parties. Impacts to be analyzed 
include:
    (1) Industry net present value, with sensitivity analyses based on 
uncertainty of costs, sales prices and sales volumes;
    (2) Cash flows, by year;
    (3) Other measures of impact, such as revenue, net income and return 
on equity, as appropriate;
    The characteristics of atypical manufacturers worthy of special 
consideration will be determined in consultation with manufacturers and 
other interested parties and may include: manufacturers incurring higher 
or lower than average costs; and manufacturers experiencing greater or 
fewer adverse impacts on sales. Alternative scenarios based on other 
methods of estimating cost or sales impacts also will be performed, as 
needed.
    (g) Cumulative impacts of other Federal regulatory actions. (1) The 
Department will recognize and seek to mitigate the overlapping effects 
on manufacturers of new or revised DOE standards and other regulatory 
actions affecting the same products. DOE will analyze and consider the 
impact on manufacturers of multiple product-specific regulatory actions. 
These factors will be considered in

[[Page 365]]

setting rulemaking priorities, assessing manufacturer impacts of a 
particular standard, and establishing the effective date for a new or 
revised standard. In particular, DOE will seek to propose effective 
dates for new or revised standards that are appropriately coordinated 
with other regulatory actions to mitigate any cumulative burden.
    (2) If the Department determines that a proposed standard would 
impose a significant impact on product manufacturers within three years 
of the effective date of another DOE standard that imposes significant 
impacts on the same manufacturers (or divisions thereof, as 
appropriate), the Department will, in addition to evaluating the impact 
on manufacturers of the proposed standard, assess the joint impacts of 
both standards on manufacturers.
    (3) If the Department is directed to establish or revise standards 
for products that are components of other products subject to standards, 
the Department will consider the interaction between such standards in 
setting rulemaking priorities and assessing manufacturer impacts of a 
particular standard. The Department will assess, as part of the 
engineering and impact analyses, the cost of components subject to 
efficiency standards.
    (h) Summary of quantitative and qualitative assessments. The summary 
of quantitative and qualitative assessments will contain a description 
and discussion of uncertainties. Alternative estimates of impacts, 
resulting from the different potential scenarios developed throughout 
the analysis, will be explicitly presented in the final analysis 
results.
    (i) Key modeling and analytical tools. In its assessment of the 
likely impacts of standards on manufacturers, the Department will use 
models which are clear and understandable, feature accessible 
calculations, and have assumptions that are clearly explained. As a 
starting point, the Department will use the Government Regulatory Impact 
Model (GRIM). The Department will consider any enhancements to the GRIM 
that are suggested by interested parties. If changes are made to the 
GRIM methodology, DOE will provide notice and seek public input. The 
Department will also support the development of economic models for 
price and volume forecasting. Research required to update key economic 
data will be considered.

         11. Principles for the Analysis of Impacts on Consumers

    (a) Early consideration of impacts on consumer utility. The 
Department will consider at the earliest stages of the development of a 
standard whether particular design options will lessen the utility of 
the covered products to the consumer. See section 4(a).
    (b) Impacts on product availability. The Department will determine, 
based on consideration of information submitted during the standard 
development process, whether a proposed standard is likely to result in 
the unavailability of any covered product type with performance 
characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, 
and volumes that are substantially the same as products generally 
available in the U.S. at the time. DOE will not promulgate a standard if 
it concludes that it would result in such unavailability.
    (c) Department of justice review. As required by law, the Department 
will solicit the views of the Justice Department on any lessening of 
competition that is likely to result from the imposition of a proposed 
standard and will give the views provided full consideration in 
assessing economic justification of a proposed standard. In addition, 
DOE may consult with the Department of Justice at earlier stages in the 
standards development process to seek to obtain preliminary views on 
competitive impacts.
    (d) Variation in consumer impacts. The Department will use regional 
analysis and sensitivity analysis tools, as appropriate, to evaluate the 
potential distribution of impacts of candidate standards levels among 
different subgroups of consumers. The Department will consider impacts 
on significant segments of consumers in determining standards levels. 
Where there are significant negative impacts on identifiable subgroups, 
DOE will consider the efficacy of voluntary approaches as a means to 
achieve potential energy savings.
    (e) Payback period and first cost. (1) In the assessment of consumer 
impacts of standards, the Department will consider Life-Cycle Cost, 
Payback Period and Cost of Conserved Energy to evaluate the savings in 
operating expenses relative to increases in purchase price. The 
Department intends to increase the level of sensitivity analysis and 
scenario analysis for future rulemakings. The results of these analyses 
will be carried throughout the analysis and the ensuing uncertainty 
described.
    (2) If, in the analysis of consumer impacts, the Department 
determines that a candidate standard level would result in a substantial 
increase in the product first costs to consumers or would not pay back 
such additional first costs through energy cost savings in less than 
three years, Department will specifically assess the likely impacts of 
such a standard on low-income households, product sales and fuel 
switching.

             12. Consideration of Non-Regulatory Approaches

    (a) The Department recognizes that voluntary or other non-regulatory 
efforts by manufacturers, utilities and other interested parties can 
result in substantial efficiency improvements. The Department intends to 
consider fully the likely effects of non-regulatory initiatives on 
product energy use,

[[Page 366]]

consumer utility and life cycle costs, manufacturers, competition, 
utilities and the environment, as well as the distribution of these 
impacts among different regions, consumers, manufacturers and utilities. 
DOE will attempt to base its assessment on the actual impacts of such 
initiatives to date, but also will consider information presented 
regarding the impacts that any existing initiative might have in the 
future. Such information is likely to include a demonstration of the 
strong commitment of manufacturers, distribution channels, utilities or 
others to such voluntary efficiency improvements. This information will 
be used in assessing the likely incremental impacts of establishing or 
revising standards, in assessing appropriate effective dates for new or 
revised standards and in considering DOE support of non-regulatory 
initiatives.
    (b) DOE believes that non-regulatory approaches are valuable 
complements to the standards program. In particular, DOE will consider 
pursuing voluntary programs where it appears that highly efficient 
products can obtain a significant market share but less efficient 
products cannot be eliminated altogether because, for instance, of 
unacceptable adverse impacts on a significant subgroup of consumers. In 
making this assessment, the Department will consider the success more 
efficient designs have had in the market, their acceptance to date, and 
their potential market penetration.

                 13. Crosscutting Analytical Assumptions

    In selecting values for certain crosscutting analytical assumptions, 
DOE expects to continue relying upon the following sources and general 
principles:
    (a) Underlying economic assumptions. The appliance standards 
analyses will generally use the same economic growth and development 
assumptions that underlie the most current Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) 
published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
    (b) Energy price and demand trends. Analyses of the likely impact of 
appliance standards on typical users will generally adopt the mid-range 
energy price and demand scenario of the EIA's most current AEO. The 
sensitivity of such estimated impacts to possible variations in future 
energy prices are likely to be examined using the EIA's high and low 
energy price scenarios.
    (c) Product-specific energy-efficiency trends, without updated 
standards. Product specific energy-efficiency trends will be based on a 
combination of the efficiency trends forecast by the EIA's residential 
and commercial demand model of the National Energy Modeling System 
(NEMS) and product-specific assessments by DOE and its contractors with 
input from interested parties.
    (d) Discount rates. For residential and commercial consumers, ranges 
of three different real discount rates will be used. For residential 
consumers, the mid-range discount rate will represent DOE's 
approximation of the average financing cost (or opportunity costs of 
reduced savings) experienced by typical consumers. Sensitivity analyses 
will be performed using discount rates reflecting the costs more likely 
to be experienced by residential consumers with little or no savings and 
credit card financing and consumers with substantial savings. For 
commercial users, a mid-range discount rate reflecting the DOE's 
approximation of the average real rate of return on commercial 
investment will be used, with sensitivity analyses being performed using 
values indicative of the range of real rates of return likely to be 
experienced by typical commercial businesses. For national net present 
value calculations, DOE would use the Administration's approximation of 
the average real rate of return on private investment in the U.S. 
economy. For manufacturer impacts, DOE plans to use a range of real 
discount rates which are representative of the real rates of return 
experienced by typical U.S. manufacturers affected by the program.
    (e) Environmental impacts. The emission rates of carbon, sulfur 
oxides and nitrogen oxides used by DOE to calculate the physical 
quantities of emissions likely to be avoided by candidate standard 
levels will be based on the current average carbon emissions of the U.S. 
electric utilities and on the projected rates of emissions of sulfur and 
nitrogen oxides. Projected rates of emissions, if available, will be 
used for the estimation of any other environmental impacts. The 
Department will consider the effects of the proposed standards on these 
emissions in reaching a decision about whether the benefits of the 
proposed standards exceed their burdens but will not determine the 
monetary value of these environmental externalities.

             14. Deviations, Revisions, and Judicial Review

    (a) Deviations. This Appendix specifies procedures, interpretations 
and policies for the development of new or revised energy efficiency 
standards in considerable detail. As the approach described in this 
Appendix is applied to the development of particular standards, the 
Department may find it necessary or appropriate to deviate from these 
procedures, interpretations or policies. If the Department concludes 
that such deviations are necessary or appropriate in a particular 
situation, DOE will provide interested parties with notice of the 
deviation and an explanation.

[[Page 367]]

    (b) Revisions. If the Department concludes that changes to the 
procedures, interpretations or policies in this Appendix are necessary 
or appropriate, DOE will provide notice in the Federal Register of 
modifications to this Appendix with an accompanying explanation. DOE 
expects to consult with interested parties prior to any such 
modification.
    (c) Judicial review. The procedures, interpretations, and policies 
stated in this Appendix are not intended to establish any new cause of 
action or right to judicial review.

    Subpart D_Petitions To Exempt State Regulation From Preemption; 
           Petitions To Withdraw Exemption of State Regulation

    Source: 54 FR 6078, Feb. 7, 1989, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 430.40  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart prescribes the procedures to be followed in 
connection with petitions requesting a rule that a State regulation 
prescribing an energy conservation standard, water conservation standard 
(in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals), or 
other requirement respecting energy efficiency, energy use, or water use 
(in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals) of a 
type (or class) of covered product not be preempted.
    (b) This subpart also prescribes the procedures to be followed in 
connection with petitions to withdraw a rule exempting a State 
regulation prescribing an energy conservation standard, water 
conservation standard (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water 
closets, and urinals), or other requirement respecting energy 
efficiency, energy use, or water use (in the case of faucets, 
showerheads, water closets, and urinals) of a type (or class) of covered 
product.

[63 FR 13318, Mar. 18, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 430.41  Prescriptions of a rule.

    (a) Criteria for exemption from preemption. Upon petition by a State 
which has prescribed an energy conservation standard, water conservation 
standard (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and 
urinals), or other requirement for a type or class of covered equipment 
for which a Federal energy conservation standard or water conservation 
standard is applicable, the Secretary shall prescribe a rule that such 
standard not be preempted if he determines that the State has 
established by a preponderance of evidence that such requirement is 
needed to meet unusual and compelling State or local energy interests or 
water interests. For the purposes of this section, the term ``unusual 
and compelling State or local energy interests or water interests'' 
means interests which are substantially different in nature or magnitude 
than those prevailing in the U.S. generally, and are such that when 
evaluated within the context of the State's energy plan and forecast, or 
water plan and forecast the costs, benefits, burdens, and reliability of 
energy savings or water savings resulting from the State regulation make 
such regulation preferable or necessary when measured against the costs, 
benefits, burdens, and reliability of alternative approaches to energy 
savings or water savings or production, including reliance on reasonably 
predictable market-induced improvements in efficiency of all equipment 
subject to the State regulation. The Secretary may not prescribe such a 
rule if he finds that interested persons have established, by a 
preponderance of the evidence, that the State's regulation will 
significantly burden manufacturing, marketing, distribution, sale or 
servicing of the covered equipment on a national basis. In determining 
whether to make such a finding, the Secretary shall evaluate all 
relevant factors including: the extent to which the State regulation 
will increase manufacturing or distribution costs of manufacturers, 
distributors, and others; the extent to which the State regulation will 
disadvantage smaller manufacturers, distributors, or dealers or lessen 
competition in the sale of the covered product in the State; the extent 
to which the State regulation would cause a burden to manufacturers to 
redesign and produce the covered product type (or class), taking into 
consideration the extent to which the regulation would result in a 
reduction in the current

[[Page 368]]

models, or in the projected availability of models, that could be 
shipped on the effective date of the regulation to the State and within 
the U.S., or in the current or projected sales volume of the covered 
product type (or class) in the State and the U.S.; and the extent to 
which the State regulation is likely to contribute significantly to a 
proliferation of State appliance efficiency requirements and the 
cumulative impact such requirements would have. The Secretary may not 
prescribe such a rule if he finds that such a rule will result in the 
unavailability in the State of any covered product (or class) of 
performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, 
capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as those 
generally available in the State at the time of the Secretary's finding. 
The failure of some classes (or types) to meet this criterion shall not 
affect the Secretary's determination of whether to prescribe a rule for 
other classes (or types).
    (1) Requirements of petition for exemption from preemption. A 
petition from a State for a rule for exemption from preemption shall 
include the information listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through 
(a)(1)(vi) of this section. A petition for a rule and correspondence 
relating to such petition shall be available for public review except 
for confidential or proprietary information submitted in accordance with 
the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information Regulations set forth 
in 10 CFR part 1004:
    (i) The name, address, and telephone number of the petitioner;
    (ii) A copy of the State standard for which a rule exempting such 
standard is sought;
    (iii) A copy of the State's energy plan or water plan and forecast;
    (iv) Specification of each type or class of covered product for 
which a rule exempting a standard is sought;
    (v) Other information, if any, believed to be pertinent by the 
petitioner; and
    (vi) Such other information as the Secretary may require.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) Criteria for exemption from preemption when energy emergency 
conditions or water emergency conditions (in the case of faucets, 
showerheads, water closets, and urinals) exist within State. Upon 
petition by a State which has prescribed an energy conservation standard 
or water conservation standard (in the case of faucets, showerheads, 
water closets, and urinals) or other requirement for a type or class of 
covered product for which a Federal energy conservation standard or 
water conservation standard is applicable, the Secretary may prescribe a 
rule, effective upon publication in the Federal Register, that such 
State regulation not be preempted if he determines that in addition to 
meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section the State has 
established that: an energy emergency condition or water emergency 
condition exists within the State that imperils the health, safety, and 
welfare of its residents because of the inability of the State or 
utilities within the State to provide adequate quantities of gas, 
electric energy, or water to its residents at less than prohibitive 
costs; and cannot be substantially alleviated by the importation of 
energy or water or the use of interconnection agreements; and the State 
regulation is necessary to alleviate substantially such condition.
    (1) Requirements of petition for exemption from preemption when 
energy emergency conditions or water emergency conditions (in the case 
of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals) exist within a 
State. A petition from a State for a rule for exemption from preemption 
when energy emergency conditions or water emergency conditions exist 
within a State shall include the information listed in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(vi) of this section. A petition shall also 
include the information prescribed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through 
(b)(1)(iv) of this section, and shall be available for public review 
except for confidential or proprietary information submitted in 
accordance with the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information 
Regulations set forth in 10 CFR part 1004:
    (i) A description of the energy emergency condition or water 
emergency condition (in the case of faucets,

[[Page 369]]

showerheads, water closets, and urinals) which exists within the State, 
including causes and impacts.
    (ii) A description of emergency response actions taken by the State 
and utilities within the State to alleviate the emergency condition;
    (iii) An analysis of why the emergency condition cannot be 
alleviated substantially by importation of energy or water or the use of 
interconnection agreements; and
    (iv) An analysis of how the State standard can alleviate 
substantially such emergency condition.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (c) Criteria for withdrawal of a rule exempting a State standard. 
Any person subject to a State standard which, by rule, has been exempted 
from Federal preemption and which prescribes an energy conservation 
standard or water conservation standard (in the case of faucets, 
showerheads, water closets, and urinals) or other requirement for a type 
or class of a covered product, when the Federal energy conservation 
standard or water conservation standard (in the case of faucets, 
showerheads, water closets, and urinals) for such product subsequently 
is amended, may petition the Secretary requesting that the exemption 
rule be withdrawn. The Secretary shall consider such petition in 
accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, 
except that the burden shall be on the petitioner to demonstrate that 
the exemption rule received by the State should be withdrawn as a result 
of the amendment to the Federal standard. The Secretary shall withdraw 
such rule if he determines that the petitioner has shown the rule should 
be withdrawn.
    (1) Requirements of petition to withdraw a rule exempting a State 
standard. A petition for a rule to withdraw a rule exempting a State 
standard shall include the information prescribed in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(vii) of this section, and shall be available 
for public review, except for confidential or proprietary information 
submitted in accordance with the Department of Energy's Freedom of 
Information Regulations set forth in 10 CFR part 1004:
    (i) The name, address and telephone number of the petitioner;
    (ii) A statement of the interest of the petitioner for which a rule 
withdrawing an exemption is sought;
    (iii) A copy of the State standard for which a rule withdrawing an 
exemption is sought;
    (iv) Specification of each type or class of covered product for 
which a rule withdrawing an exemption is sought;
    (v) A discussion of the factors contained in paragraph (a) of this 
section;
    (vi) Such other information, if any, believed to be pertinent by the 
petitioner; and
    (vii) Such other information as the Secretary may require.

    (i) Such a procedure will only be followed after the Secretary or 
his designated representative has examined the underlying test data 
provided by the manufacturer and after the manufacturer has been offered 
the opportunity to meet with DOE to verify compliance with the 
applicable performance standard. A representative designated by the 
Secretary shall be permitted to observe any reverification procedures by 
this subpart, and to inspect the results of such reverification.
    (ii) The test notice will be signed by the Secretary or his 
designee. The test notice will be mailed or delivered by DOE to the 
plant manager or other responsible official, as designated by the 
manufacturer.
    (iii) The test notice will specify the model or basic model to be 
selected for testing, the method of selecting the test sample, the time 
at which testing shall be initiated, the date by which testing is 
scheduled to be completed and the facility at which testing will be 
conducted. The test notice may also provide for situations in which the 
selected basic model is unavailable for testing, and may include 
alternative basic models.
    (iv) The Secretary may require in the test notice that the 
manufacturer of a covered product shall ship at his expense a reasonable 
number of units of a basic model specified in such test notice to a 
testing laboratory designated by the Secretary. The number of units of a 
basic model specified in a test notice shall not exceed twenty (20).
    (v) Within 5 working days of the time units are selected, the 
manufacturer shall ship the specified test units of a basic model to the 
testing laboratory.
    (2) Testing Laboratory. Whenever DOE conducts enforcement testing at 
a designated laboratory in accordance with a test notice under this 
section, the resulting test data shall constitute official test data for 
that basic model. Such test data will be used by DOE to make a 
determination of compliance or noncompliance if a sufficient number of 
tests have been conducted to satisfy the requirements of appendix B of 
this subpart.
    (3) Sampling. The determination that a manufacturer's basic model 
complies with the applicable energy performance standard or water 
performance standard (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water 
closets, and urinals) shall be based on the testing conducted in 
accordance with the statistical sampling procedures set forth in 
appendix B of this subpart and the test procedures set forth in subpart 
B of this part.
    (4) Test unit selection. A DOE inspector shall select a batch, a 
batch sample, and test units from the batch sample in accordance with 
the provisions of this paragraph and the conditions specified in the 
test notice.
    (i) The batch may be subdivided by DOE utilizing criteria specified 
in the test notice, e.g., date of manufacture, component-supplier, 
location of manufacturing facility, or other criteria which may 
differentiate one unit from another within a basic model.

[[Page 378]]

    (ii) A batch sample of up to 20 units will then be randomly selected 
from one or more subdivided groups within the batch. The manufacturer 
shall keep on hand all units in the batch sample until such time as the 
basic model is determined to be in compliance or noncompliance.
    (iii) Individual test units comprising the test sample shall be 
randomly selected from the batch sample.
    (iv) All random selection shall be achieved by sequentially 
numbering all of the units in a batch sample and then using a table of 
random numbers to select the units to be tested.
    (5) Test unit preparation. (i) Prior to and during testing, a test 
unit selected in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section shall 
not be prepared, modified, or adjusted in any manner unless such 
preparation, modification, or adjustment is allowed by the applicable 
DOE test procedure. One test shall be conducted for each test unit in 
accordance with the applicable test procedures prescribed in subpart B.
    (ii) No quality control, testing or assembly procedures shall be 
performed on a test unit, or any parts and subassemblies thereof, that 
is not performed during the production and assembly of all other units 
included in the basic model.
    (iii) A test unit shall be considered defective if such unit is 
inoperative or is found to be in noncompliance due to failure of the 
unit to operate according to the manufacturer's design and operating 
instructions. Defective units, including those damaged due to shipping 
or handling, shall be reported immediately to DOE. DOE shall authorize 
testing of an additional unit on a case-by-case basis.
    (6) Testing at manufacturer's option. (i) If a manufacturer's basic 
model is determined to be in noncompliance with the applicable energy 
performance standard or water performance standard (in the case of 
faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals) at the conclusion of 
DOE testing in accordance with the double sampling plan specified in 
appendix B of this subpart, the manufacturer may request that DOE 
conduct additional testing of the model according to procedures set 
forth in appendix B of this subpart.
    (ii) All units tested under paragraph (a)(6) of this section shall 
be selected and tested in accordance with the provisions given in 
paragraphs (a) (1) through (5) of this section.
    (iii) The manufacturer shall bear the cost of all testing conducted 
under paragraph (a)(6) of this section.
    (iv) The manufacturer shall cease distribution of the basic model 
being tested under the provisions of paragraph (a)(6) of this section 
from the time the manufacturer elects to exercise the option provided in 
this paragraph until the basic model is determined to be in compliance. 
DOE may seek civil penalties for all units distributed during such 
period.
    (v) If the additional testing results in a determination of 
compliance, a notice of allowance to resume distribution shall be issued 
by the Department.
    (b) Design standard. In the case of a design standard, a model is 
determined noncompliant by DOE after the Secretary or his designated 
representative has examined the underlying design information provided 
by the manufacturer and after the manufacturer has been offered the 
opportunity to verify compliance with the applicable design standard.

Sec. 430.71  Cessation of distribution of a basic model.

    (a) In the event that a model is determined noncompliant by DOE in 
accordance with Sec. 430.70 of this part or if a manufacturer or 
private labeler determines a model to be in noncompliance, then the 
manufacturer or private labeler shall:
    (1) Immediately cease distribution in commerce of the basic model;
    (2) Give immediate written notification of the determination of 
noncompliance, to all persons to whom the manufacturer has distributed 
units of the basic model manufactured since the date of the last 
determination of compliance.
    (3) Pursuant to a request made by the Secretary, provide DOE within 
30 days of the request, records, reports and other documentation 
pertaining to the

[[Page 379]]

acquisition, ordering, storage, shipment, or sale of a basic model 
determined to be in noncompliance.
    (4) The manufacturer may modify the noncompliant basic model in such 
manner as to make it comply with the applicable performance standard. 
Such modified basic model shall then be treated as a new basic model and 
must be certified in accordance with the provisions of this subpart; 
except that in addition satisfying all requirements of this subpart, the 
manufacturer shall also maintain records that demonstrate that 
modifications have been made to all units of the new basic model prior 
to distribution in commerce.
    (b) If a basic model is not properly certified in accordance with 
the requirements of this subpart, the Secretary may seek, among other 
remedies, injunctive action to prohibit distribution in commerce of such 
basic model.


<R05>
Sec. 430.72  Subpoena.

    Pursuant to section 329(a) of the Act, for purposes of carrying out 
this part, the Secretary or the Secretary's designee, may sign and issue 
subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the 
production of relevant books, records, papers, and other documents, and 
administer the oaths. Witnesses summoned under the provisions of this 
section shall be paid the same fees and mileage as are paid to witnesses 
in the courts of the United States. In case of contumacy by, or refusal 
to obey a subpoena served, upon any persons subject to this part, the 
Secretary may seek an order from the District Court of the United States 
for any District in which such person is found or resides or transacts 
business requiring such person to appear and give testimony, or to 
appear and produce documents. Failure to obey such order is punishable 
by such court as a contempt thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 430.73  Remedies.

    If DOE determines that a basic model of a covered product does not 
comply with an applicable energy conservation standard or water 
conservation standard (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water 
closets, and urinals):
    (a) DOE will notify the manufacturer, private labeler or any other 
person as required, of this finding and of the Secretary's intent to 
seek a judicial order restraining further distribution in commerce of 
such basic model unless the manufacturer, private labeler or any other 
person as required, delivers to DOE within 15 calendar days a statement, 
satisfactory to DOE, of the steps he will take to insure that the 
noncompliant model will no longer be distributed in commerce. DOE will 
monitor the implementation of such statement.
    (b) If the manufacturer, private labeler or any other person as 
required, fails to stop distribution of the noncompliant model, the 
Secretary may seek to restrain such violation in accordance with section 
334 of the Act.
    (c) The Secretary shall determine whether the facts of the case 
warrant the assessment of civil penalties for knowing violations in 
accordance with section 333 of the Act.

has been made on the record after an opportunity for an agency hearing 
pursuant to section 554 of title 5, United States Code, before an 
administrative law judge appointed under section 3105 of such title 5. 
Such

[[Page 380]]

assessment order shall include the administrative law judge's findings 
and the basis for such assessment.
    (2) Any person against whom a penalty is assessed under this section 
may, within 60 calendar days after the date of the order of the 
Secretary assessing such penalty, institute an action in the United 
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate judicial circuit for 
judicial review of such order in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5, 
United States Code. The court shall have jurisdiction to enter a 
judgment affirming, modifying, or setting aside in whole or in part, the 
order of the Secretary, or the court may remand the proceeding to the 
Secretary for such further action as the court may direct.
    (c)(1) In the case of any civil penalty with respect to which the 
procedures of this section have been elected, the Secretary shall 
promptly assess such penalty, by order, after the date of the receipt of 
the notice under paragraph (a) of this section of the proposed penalty.

after the assessment has been made under paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, the Secretary shall institute an action in the appropriate 
District Court of the United States for an order affirming the 
assessment of the civil penalty. The court shall have authority to 
review de novo the law and the facts involved and shall have 
jurisdiction to enter a judgment enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as 
so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part, such assessment.
    (3) Any election to have this paragraph apply may not be revoked 
except with the consent of the Secretary.
    (d) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty 
after it has become a final and unappealable order under paragraph (b) 
of this section, or after the appropriate District Court has entered 
final judgment in favor of the Secretary under paragraph (c) of this 
section, the Secretary shall institute an action to recover the amount 
of such penalty in any appropriate District Court of the United States. 
In such action, the validity and appropriateness of such final 
assessment order or judgment shall not be subject to review.
    (e)(1) In accordance with the provisions of section 333(d)(5)(A) of

Sec. Appendix B to Subpart F of Part 430--Sampling Plan For Enforcement 
                                 Testing

                             Double Sampling

    Step 1. The first sample size (n<INF>1</INF>) must be four or more 
units.
    Step 2. Compute the mean (x<INF>1</INF>) of the measured energy 
performance or water performance (in the case of faucets, showerheads, 
water closets, and urinals) of the n<INF>1</INF> units in the first 
sample as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.010

where (x<INF>1</INF>) is the measured energy efficiency, energy or water 
(in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals) 
consumption of unit I.
    Step 3. Compute the standard deviation (s<INF>1</INF>) of the 
measured energy or water performance of the (n<INF>1</INF>) units in the 
first sample as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.011

    Step 4. Compute the standard error (S<INF>X</INFS<INF>1</INF>) of 
the measured energy or water performance of the n<INF>1</INF> units in 
the first sample as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.012

    Step 5. Compute the upper control limit (UCL<INF>1</INF>) and lower 
control limit (LCL<INF>1</INF>) for the mean of the first sample using 
the applicable

[[Page 382]]

DOE energy or water performance standard (EPS) as the desired mean and a 
probability level of 95 percent (two-tailed test) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.013

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.014

where t is a statistic based on a 95 percent two-tailed probability 
level and a sample size of n<INF>1</INF>.
    Step 6(a). For an Energy Efficiency Standard, compare the mean of 
the first sample (x<INF>1</INF>) with the upper and lower control limits 
(UCL<INF>1</INF> and LCL<INF>1</INF>) to determine one of the following:
    (1) If the mean of the first sample is below the lower control 
limit, then the basic model is in noncompliance and testing is at an 
end. (Do not go on to any of the steps below.)
    (2) If the mean of the first sample is equal to or greater than the 
upper control limit, then the basic model is in compliance and testing 
is at an end. (Do not go on to any of the steps below.)
    (3) If the sample mean is equal to or greater than the lower control 
limit but less than the upper control limit, then no determination of 
compliance or noncompliance can be made and a second sample size is 
determined by Step 7(a).
    Step 6(b). For an Energy or Water Consumption Standard, compare the 
mean of the first sample (x<INF>1</INF>) with the upper and lower 
control limits (UCL<INF>1</INF> and LCL<INF>1</INF>) to determine one of 
the following:
    (1) If the mean of the first sample is above the upper control 
limit, then the basic model is in noncompliance and testing is at an 
end. (Do not go on to any of the steps below.)
    (2) If the mean of the first sample is equal to or less than the 
lower control limit, then the basic model is in compliance and testing 
is at an end. (Do not go on to any of the steps below.)
    (3) If the sample mean is equal to or less than the upper control 
limit but greater than the lower control limit, then no determination of 
compliance or noncompliance can be made and a second sample size is 
determined by Step 7(b).
    Step 7(a). For an Energy Efficiency Standard, determine the second 
sample size (n<INF>2</INF>) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.015

    where s<INF>1</INF> and t have the values used in Steps 4 and 5, 
respectively. The term ``0.05 EPS'' is the difference between the 
applicable energy efficiency standard and 95 percent of the standard, 
where 95 percent of the standard is taken as the lower control limit. 
This procedure yields a sufficient combined sample size 
(n<INF>1</INF>+n<INF>2</INF>) to give an estimated 97.5 percent 
probability of obtaining a determination of compliance when the true 
mean efficiency is equal to the applicable standard. Given the solution 
value of n<INF>2</INF>, determine one of the following:
    (1) If the value of n<INF>2</INF> is less than or equal to zero and 
if the mean energy efficiency of the first sample (x<INF>1</INF>) is 
either equal to or greater than the lower control limit 
(LCL<INF>1</INF>) or equal to or greater than 95 percent of the 
applicable energy efficiency standard (EES), whichever is greater, i.e., 
if n<INF>2</INF> <= 0 and x<INF>1</INF> <ls-thn-eq>= max 
(LCL<INF>1</INF>, 0.95 EES), the basic model is in compliance and 
testing is at an end.
    (2) If the value of n<INF>2</INF> is less than or equal to zero and 
the mean energy efficiency of the first sample (x<INF>1</INF>) is less 
than the lower control limit (LCL<INF>1</INF>) or less than 95 percent 
of the applicable energy efficiency standard (EES), whichever is 
greater, i.e., if n<INF>2</INF> <= 0 and x<INF>1</INF> <ls-thn-eq>= max 
(LCL<INF>1</INF>, 0.95 EES), the basic model is in noncompliance and 
testing is at an end.
    (3) If the value of n<INF>2</INF> is greater than zero, then value 
of the second sample size is determined to be the smallest integer equal 
to or greater than the solution value of n<INF>2</INF> for equation 
(6a). If the value of n<INF>2</INF> so calculated is greater than 20-
n<INF>1</INF>, set n<INF>2</INF> equal to 20-n<INF>1</INF>.
    Step 7(b). For an Energy or Water Consumption Standard, determine 
the second sample size (n<INF>2</INF>) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.016

where s<INF>1</INF> and t have the values used in Steps 4 and 5, 
respectively. The term ``0.05 EPS'' is the difference between the 
applicable energy or water consumption standard and 105 percent of the 
standard, where 105 percent of the standard is taken as the upper 
control limit. This procedure yields a sufficient combined sample size 
(n<INF>1</INF>+n<INF>2</INF>) to give an estimated 97.5 percent 
probability of obtaining a determination of compliance when the true 
mean consumption is equal to the applicable standard. Given the solution 
value of n<INF>2</INF>, determine one of the following:
    (1) If the value of n<INF>2</INF> is less than or equal to zero and 
if the mean energy or water consumption of the first sample 
(x<INF>1</INF>) is either equal to or less than the upper control limit 
(UCL<INF>1</INF>) or equal to or less than 105 percent of the applicable 
energy or water performance standard (EPS), whichever is less, i.e., if 
n<INF>2</INF> <= 0 and x<INF>1</INF> <= min (UCL<INF>1</INF>, 1.05 EPS), 
the basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end.
    (2) If the value of n<INF>2</INF> is less than or equal to zero and 
the mean energy or water consumption of the first sample (x<INF>1</INF>) 
is greater than the upper control limit (UCL<INF>1</INF>) or more than 
105 percent of the applicable energy or water performance standard 
(EPS), whichever is

[[Page 383]]

less, i.e., if n<INF>2</INF> <= 0 and x<INF>1</INF> <ls-thn-eq> min 
(UCL<INF>1</INF>, 1.05 EPS), the basic model is in noncompliance and 
testing is at an end.
    (3) If the value of n<INF>2</INF> is greater than zero, then the 
value of the second sample size is determined to be the smallest integer 
equal to or greater than the solution value of n<INF>2</INF> for 
equation (6b). If the value of n<INF>2</INF> so calculated is greater 
than 20-n<INF>1</INF>, set n<INF>2</INF> equal to 20-n<INF>1</INF>.
    Step 8. Compute the combined mean (x<INF>2</INF>) of the measured 
energy or water performance of the n<INF>1</INF> and n<INF>2</INF> units 
of the combined first and second samples as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.017

    Step 9. Compute the standard error (S<INF>x1</INF>) of the measured 
energy or water performance of the n<INF>1</INF> and n<INF>2</INF> units 
in the combined first and second samples as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.018

    Note: s<INF>1</INF> is the value obtained in Step 3.

    Step 10(a). For an Energy Efficiency Standard, compute the lower 
control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>) for the mean of the combined first and 
second samples using the DOE energy efficiency standard (EES) as the 
desired mean and a one-tailed probability level of 97.5 percent 
(equivalent to the two-tailed probability level of 95 percent used in 
Step 5) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.019

where the t-statistic has the value obtained in Step 5.
    Step 10(b). For an Energy or Water Consumption Standard, compute the 
upper control limit (UCL<INF>2</INF>) for the mean of the combined first 
and second samples using the DOE energy or water performance standard 
(EPS) as the desired mean and a one-tailed probability level of 102.5 
percent (equivalent to the two-tailed probability level of 95 percent 
used in Step 5) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MR98.020

where the t-statistic has the value obtained in Step 5.
    Step 11(a). For an Energy Efficiency Standard, compare the combined 
sample mean (x<INF>2</INF>) to the lower control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>) 
to find one of the following:
    (1) If the mean of the combined sample (x<INF>2</INF>) is less than 
the lower control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>) or 95 percent of the 
applicable energy efficiency standard (EES), whichever is greater, i.e., 
if x<INF>2</INF> < max (LCL<INF>2</INF>, 0.95 EES), the basic model is 
in noncompliance and testing is at an end.
    (2) If the mean of the combined sample (x<INF>2</INF>) is equal to 
or greater than the lower control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>) or 95 percent 
of the applicable energy efficiency standard (EES), whichever is 
greater, i.e., if x<INF>2</INF> <ls-thn-eq>= max (LCL<INF>2</INF>, 0.95 
EES), the basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end.
    Step 11(b). For an Energy or Water Consumption Standard, compare the 
combined sample mean (x<INF>2</INF>) to the upper control limit 
(UCL<INF>2</INF>) to find one of the following:
    (1) If the mean of the combined sample (x<INF>2</INF>) is greater 
than the upper control limit (UCL<INF>2</INF>) or 105 percent of the 
applicable energy or water performance standard (EPS), whichever is 
less, i.e., if x<INF>2</INF> <ls-thn-eq> min (UCL<INF>2</INF>, 1.05 
EPS), the basic model is in noncompliance and testing is at an end.
    (2) If the mean of the combined sample (x<INF>2</INF>) is equal to 
or less than the upper control limit (UCL<INF>2</INF>) or 105 percent of 
the applicable energy or water performance standard (EPS), whichever is 
less, i.e., if x<INF>2</INF> <= min (UCL<INF>2</INF>, 1.05 EPS), the 
basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end.

                       Manufacturer-Option Testing

    If a determination of non-compliance is made in Steps 6, 7 or 11, 
the manufacturer may request that additional testing be conducted, in 
accordance with the following procedures.
    Step A. The manufacturer requests that an additional number, 
n<INF>3</INF>, of units be tested, with n<INF>3</INF> chosen such that 
n<INF>1</INF>+n<INF>2</INF>+n<INF>3</INF> does not exceed 20.
    Step B. Compute the mean energy or water performance, standard 
error, and lower or upper control limit of the new combined sample in 
accordance with the procedures prescribed in Steps 8, 9, and 10, above.
    Step C. Compare the mean performance of the new combined sample to 
the revised lower or upper control limit to determine one of the 
following:
    a.1. For an Energy Efficiency Standard, if the new combined sample 
mean is equal to or greater than the lower control limit or 95 percent 
of the applicable energy efficiency standard, whichever is greater, the 
basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end.
    a.2. For an Energy or Water Consumption Standard, if the new 
combined sample mean is equal to or less than the upper control limit or 
105 percent of the applicable energy or water consumption standard, 
whichever is less, the basic model is in compliance and testing is at an 
end.
    b.1. For an Energy Efficiency Standard, if the new combined sample 
mean is less than the lower control limit or 95 percent of the 
applicable energy efficiency standard, whichever, is greater, and the 
value of n<INF>1</INF>+n<INF>2</INF>+n<INF>3</INF> is less than 20, the 
manufacturer may request that additional units be tested. The total of 
all units tested may not exceed 20. Steps A, B, and C are then repeated.

[[Page 384]]

    b.2. For an Energy or Water Consumption Standard, if the new 
combined sample mean is greater than the upper control limit or 105 
percent of the applicable energy or water consumption standard, 
whichever is less, and the value of 
n<INF>1</INF>+n<INF>2</INF>+n<INF>3</INF> is less than 20, the 
manufacturer may request that additional units be tested. The total of 
all units tested may not exceed 20. Steps A, B, and C are then repeated.
    c. Otherwise, the basic model is determined to be in noncompliance.

Sec. 431.16  Test procedures for the measurement of energy efficiency.

    For purposes of 10 CFR Part 431 and EPCA, the test procedures for 
measuring the energy efficiency of an electric motor shall be the test 
procedures specified in appendix B to this subpart B.


<R05>
Sec. 431.17  Determination of efficiency.

    When a party determines the energy efficiency of an electric motor 
in order to comply with an obligation imposed on it by or pursuant to 
Part C of Title III of EPCA, 42 U.S.C. 6311-6316, this Section applies. 
This section does not apply to enforcement testing conducted pursuant to 
Sec. 431.192.
    (a) Provisions applicable to all electric motors--(1) General 
requirements. The average full load efficiency of each basic model of 
electric motor must be determined either by testing in accordance with 
Sec. 431.16 of this subpart, or by application of an alternative 
efficiency determination method (AEDM) that meets the requirements of 
paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section, provided, however, that an 
AEDM may be used to determine the average full load efficiency of one or 
more of a manufacturer's basic models only if the average full load 
efficiency of at least five of its

[[Page 392]]

other basic models is determined through testing.
    (2) Alternative efficiency determination method. An AEDM applied to 
a basic model must be:
    (i) Derived from a mathematical model that represents the mechanical 
and electrical characteristics of that basic model, and
    (ii) Based on engineering or statistical analysis, computer 
simulation or modeling, or other analytic evaluation of performance 
data.
    (3) Substantiation of an alternative efficiency determination 
method. Before an AEDM is used, its accuracy and reliability must be 
substantiated as follows:
    (i) The AEDM must be applied to at least five basic models that have 
been tested in accordance with Sec. 431.16, and
    (ii) The predicted total power loss for each such basic model, 
calculated by applying the AEDM, must be within plus or minus ten 
percent of the mean total power loss determined from the testing of that 
basic model.
    (4) Subsequent verification of an AEDM. (i) Each manufacturer shall 
periodically select basic models representative of those to which it has 
applied an AEDM, and for each basic model selected shall either:
    (A) Subject a sample of units to testing in accordance with Sec. 
Sec. 431.16 and 431.17(b)(2) by an accredited laboratory that meets the 
requirements of Sec. 431.18;
    (B) Have a certification body recognized under Sec. 431.20 certify 
its nominal full load efficiency; or
    (C) Have an independent state-registered professional engineer, who 
is qualified to perform an evaluation of electric motor efficiency in a 
highly competent manner and who is not an employee of the manufacturer, 
review the manufacturer's representations and certify that the results 
of the AEDM accurately represent the total power loss and nominal full 
load efficiency of the basic model.
    (ii) Each manufacturer that has used an AEDM under this section 
shall have available for inspection by the Department of Energy records 
showing: the method or methods used; the mathematical model, the 
engineering or statistical analysis, computer simulation or modeling, 
and other analytic evaluation of performance data on which the AEDM is 
based; complete test data, product information, and related information 
that the manufacturer has generated or acquired pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(3) and (a)(4)(i) of this section; and the calculations used to 
determine the average full load efficiency and total power losses of 
each basic model to which the AEDM was applied.
    (iii) If requested by the Department, the manufacturer shall conduct 
simulations to predict the performance of particular basic models of 
electric motors specified by the Department, analyses of previous 
simulations conducted by the manufacturer, sample testing of basic 
models selected by the Department, or a combination of the foregoing.
    (5) Use of a certification program or accredited laboratory. (i) A 
manufacturer may have a certification program, that DOE has classified 
as nationally recognized under Sec. 431.20, certify the nominal full 
load efficiency of a basic model of electric motor, and issue a 
certificate of conformity for the motor.
    (ii) For each basic model for which a certification program is not 
used as described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, any testing of 
the motor pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section to 
determine its energy efficiency must be carried out in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section, in an accredited laboratory that meets 
the requirements of Sec. 431.18. (This includes testing of the basic 
model, pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, to substantiate 
an AEDM.)
    (b) Additional testing requirements applicable when a certification 
program is not used--(1) Selection of basic models for testing. (i) 
Basic models must be selected for testing in accordance with the 
following criteria:
    (A) Two of the basic models must be among the five basic models with 
the highest unit volumes of production by the manufacturer in the prior 
year, or during the prior 12 calendar month period beginning in 1997,\1\ 
whichever is later;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ In identifying thse five basic models, any electric motor that 
does not comply with Sec. 431.25 shall be excluded from consideration.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 393]]

    (B) The basic models should be of different horsepowers without 
duplication;
    (C) The basic models should be of different frame number series 
without duplication; and
    (D) Each basic model should be expected to have the lowest nominal 
full load efficiency among the basic models with the same rating 
(``rating'' as used here has the same meaning as it has in the 
definition of ``basic model'').
    (ii) In any instance where it is impossible for a manufacturer to 
select basic models for testing in accordance with all of these 
criteria, the criteria shall be given priority in the order in which 
they are listed. Within the limits imposed by the criteria, basic models 
shall be selected randomly.
    (2) Selection of units for testing. For each basic model selected 
for testing,\2\ a sample of units shall be selected at random and 
tested. The sample shall be comprised of production units of the basic 
model, or units that are representative of such production units. The 
sample size shall be not fewer than five units, except that when fewer 
than five units of a basic model would be produced over a reasonable 
period of time (approximately 180 days), then each unit shall be tested. 
In a test of compliance with a represented average or nominal 
efficiency:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Components of similar design may be substituted without 
requiring additional testing if the represented measures of energy 
consumption continue to satisfy the applicable sampling provision.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) The average full-load efficiency of the sample X which is 
defined by
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.001


where Xi is the measured full-load efficiency of unit i and n is the 
number of units tested, shall satisfy the condition:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.002


where RE is the represented nominal full-load efficiency, and
    (ii) The lowest full-load efficiency in the sample X<INF>min</INF>, 
which is defined by
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.003


shall satisfy the condition
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.004

    (3) Substantiation of an alternative efficiency determination 
method. The basic models tested under Sec. 431.17(a)(3)(i) must be 
selected for testing in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, and units of each such basic model must be tested in accordance 
with paragraph (b)(2) of this section by an accredited laboratory that 
meets the requirements of Sec. 431.18.


<R05>
Sec. 431.18  Testing laboratories.

    (a) Testing pursuant to Sec. 431.17(a)(5)(ii) must be conducted in 
an accredited laboratory for which the accreditation body was:
    (1) The National Institute of Standards and Technology/National 
Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NIST/NVLAP); or
    (2) A laboratory accreditation body having a mutual recognition 
arrangement with NIST/NVLAP; or
    (3) An organization classified by the Department, pursuant to Sec. 
431.19, as an accreditation body.
    (b) NIST/NVLAP is under the auspices of the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) which is part of the U.S. Department of 
Commerce. NIST/NVLAP accreditation is granted on the basis of 
conformance with criteria published in 15 CFR Part 285, The National 
Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program Procedures and General 
Requirements. NIST Handbook 150-10, August 1995, presents the technical 
requirements of the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program 
for the Efficiency of Electric Motors field of accreditation. This 
handbook supplements NIST Handbook 150, National Voluntary Laboratory 
Accreditation Program Procedures and General Requirements, which 
contains 15 CFR Part 285 plus all general NIST/NVLAP procedures, 
criteria, and policies. Changes in NIST/NVLAP's criteria, procedures, 
policies, standards or other bases for granting accreditation, occurring 
subsequent to the initial effective

[[Page 394]]

date of 10 CFR Part 431, shall not apply to accreditation under this 
Part unless approved in writing by the Department of Energy. Information 
regarding NIST/NVLAP and its Efficiency of Electric Motors Program (EEM) 
can be obtained from NIST/NVLAP, 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 2140,

    (b) For purposes of determining the required minimum nominal full 
load efficiency of an electric motor that has a horsepower or kilowatt 
rating between two horsepowers or kilowattages listed consecutively in 
paragraph (a) of this section, each such motor shall be deemed to have a 
horsepower or kilowatt rating that is listed in paragraph (a) of this 
section. The rating that the motor is deemed to have shall be determined 
as follows:
    (1) A horsepower at or above the midpoint between the two 
consecutive horsepowers shall be rounded up to the higher of the two 
horsepowers;
    (2) A horsepower below the midpoint between the two consecutive 
horsepowers shall be rounded down to the lower of the two horsepowers, 
or

[[Page 398]]

    (3) A kilowatt rating shall be directly converted from kilowatts to 
horsepower using the formula, 1 kilowatt = (1 / 0.746) horsepower, 
without calculating beyond three significant decimal places, and the 
resulting horsepower shall be rounded in accordance with paragraphs 
(b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, whichever applies.
    (c) This section does not apply to definite purpose motors, special 
purpose motors, and those motors exempted by the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 431.26  Preemption of State regulations.

    Any State regulation providing for any energy conservation standard, 
or other requirement with respect to the energy efficiency or energy 
use, of an electric motor that is not identical to a Federal standard in 
effect under this subpart is preempted by that standard, except as 
provided for in Section 345(a) and 327(b) and (c) of the Act.

                                Labeling


<R05>
Sec. 431.30  Applicability of labeling requirements.

applicable standard prescribed in Sec. 431.25, as determined pursuant 
to this subpart, and is covered by a Compliance Certification that 
satisfies Sec. 431.36.
    (b) Disclosure of efficiency information in marketing materials. (1) 
The same information that must appear on an electric motor's permanent 
nameplate pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, shall be 
prominently displayed:
    (i) On each page of a catalog that lists the motor; and
    (ii) In other materials used to market the motor.
    (2) The ``ee'' logo, or other similar logo or designations, may also 
be used in catalogs and other materials to the same extent they may be 
used on labels under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 431.32  Preemption of State regulations.

    The provisions of Sec. 431.31 supersede any State regulation to the 
extent required by Section 327 of the Act. Pursuant to the Act, all 
State regulations that require the disclosure for any

[[Page 399]]

electric motor of information with respect to energy consumption, other 
than the information required to be disclosed in accordance with this 
part, are superseded.

                              Certification


<R05>
Sec. 431.35  Applicability of certification requirements.

    Section 431.36 sets forth the procedures for manufacturers to 
certify that electric motors comply with the applicable energy 
efficiency standards set forth in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 431.36  Compliance Certification.

    (a) General. Beginning April 26, 2003, a manufacturer or private 
labeler shall not distribute in commerce any basic model of an electric 
motor which is subject to an energy efficiency standard set forth in 
this subpart unless it has submitted to the Department a Compliance 
Certification certifying, in accordance with the provisions of this 
section, that the basic model meets the requirements of the applicable 
standard. The representations in the Compliance Certification must be 
based upon the basic model's energy efficiency as determined in 
accordance with the applicable requirements of this subpart. This means, 
in part, that either:
    (1) The representations as to the basic model must be based on use 
of a certification organization; or
    (2) Any testing of the basic model on which the representations are 
based must be conducted at an accredited laboratory.
    (b) Required contents--(1) General representations. Each Compliance 
Certification must certify that:
    (i) The nominal full load efficiency for each basic model of 
electric motor distributed is not less than the minimum nominal full 
load efficiency required for that motor by Sec. 431.25;
    (ii) All required determinations on which the Compliance 
Certification is based were made in compliance with the applicable 
requirements prescribed in this subpart;
    (iii) All information reported in the Compliance Certification is 
true, accurate, and complete; and
    (iv) The manufacturer or private labeler is aware of the penalties 
associated with violations of the Act and the regulations thereunder, 
and of 18 U.S.C. 1001 which prohibits knowingly making false statements 
to the Federal Government.
    (2) Specific data. (i) For each rating of electric motor (as the 
term ``rating'' is defined in the definition of basic model) which a 
manufacturer or private labeler distributes, the Compliance 
Certification must report the nominal full load efficiency, determined 
pursuant to Sec. Sec. 431.16 and 431.17, of the least efficient basic 
model within that rating.
    (ii) The Compliance Certification must identify the basic models on 
which actual testing has been performed to meet the requirements of 
Sec. 431.17.
    (iii) The format for a Compliance Certification is set forth in 
appendix C of this subpart.
    (c) Optional contents. In any Compliance Certification, a 
manufacturer or private labeler may at its option request that DOE 
provide it with a unique Compliance Certification number (``CC number'') 
for any brand name, trademark or other label name under which the 
manufacturer or private labeler distributes electric motors covered by 
the Certification. Such a Compliance Certification must also identify 
all other names, if any, under which the manufacturer or private labeler 
distributes electric motors, and to which the request does not apply.
    (d) Signature and submission. A manufacturer or private labeler must 
submit the Compliance Certification either on its own behalf, signed by 
a corporate officer of the company, or through a third party (for 
example, a trade association or other authorized representative) acting 
on its behalf. Where a third party is used, the Compliance Certification 
must identify the official of the manufacturer or private labeler who 
authorized the third party to make representations on the company's 
behalf, and must be signed by a corporate official of the third party. 
The Compliance Certification must be submitted to the Department by 
certified mail, to Department of Energy, Assistant Secretary for Energy 
Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Building Technologies

[[Page 400]]

(EE-2J), Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, 
DC 20585-0121.
    (e) New basic models. For electric motors, a Compliance 
Certification must be submitted for a new basic model only if the 
manufacturer or private labeler has not previously submitted to DOE a 
Compliance Certification, that meets the requirements of this section, 
for a basic model that has the same rating as the new basic model, and 
that has a lower nominal full load efficiency than the new basic model.
    (f) Response to Compliance Certification; Compliance Certification 
Number (CC number)--(1) DOE processing of Certification. Promptly upon 
receipt of a Compliance Certification, the Department will determine 
whether the document contains all of the elements required by this 
section, and may, in its discretion, determine whether all or part of 
the information provided in the document is accurate. The Department 
will then advise the submitting party in writing either that the 
Compliance Certification does not satisfy the requirements of this 
section, in which case the document will be returned, or that the 
Compliance Certification satisfies this section. The Department will 
also advise the submitting party of the basis for its determination.
    (2) Issuance of CC number(s). (i) Initial Compliance Certification. 
When DOE advises that the initial Compliance Certification submitted by 
or on behalf of a manufacturer or private labeler is acceptable, either:
    (A) DOE will provide a single unique CC number, ``CC--------,'' to 
the manufacturer or private labeler, and such CC number shall be 
applicable to all electric motors distributed by the manufacturer or 
private labeler, or
    (B) When required by paragraph (f)(3) of this section, DOE will 
provide more than one CC number to the manufacturer or private labeler.
    (ii) Subsequent Compliance Certification. When DOE advises that any 
other Compliance Certification is acceptable, it will provide a unique 
CC number for any brand name, trademark or other name when required by 
paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
    (iii) When DOE declines to provide a CC number as requested by a 
manufacturer or private labeler in accordance with Sec. 431.36(c), DOE 
will advise the requester of the reasons for such refusal.
    (3) Issuance of two or more CC numbers. (i) DOE will provide a 
unique CC number for each brand name, trademark or other label name for 
which a manufacturer or private labeler requests such a number in 
accordance with Sec. 431.36(c), except as follows. DOE will not provide 
a CC number for any brand name, trademark or other label name
    (A) For which DOE has previously provided a CC number, or
    (B) That duplicates or overlaps with other names under which the 
manufacturer or private labeler sells electric motors.
    (ii) Once DOE has provided a CC number for a particular name, that 
shall be the only CC number applicable to all electric motors 
distributed by the manufacturer or private labeler under that name.
    (iii) If the Compliance Certification in which a manufacturer or 
private labeler requests a CC number is the initial Compliance 
Certification submitted by it or on its behalf, and it distributes 
electric motors not covered by the CC number(s) DOE provides in response 
to the request(s), DOE will also provide a unique CC number that shall 
be applicable to all of these other motors.

 Sec. Appendix A to Subpart B of 10 CFR Part 431, Policy Statement for 
  Electric Motors Covered Under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act

    This is a reprint of a policy statement which was published on 
November 5, 1997 at 62 FR 59978.

Policy Statement for Electric Motors Covered Under the Energy Policy and 
                            Conservation Act

                             I. Introduction

    The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), 42 U.S.C. 6311, et 
seq., establishes energy efficiency standards and test procedures for 
certain commercial and industrial electric motors manufactured (alone or 
as a component of another piece of equipment) after October 24, 1997, 
or, in the case of an electric motor which requires listing or 
certification by a nationally recognized safety

[[Page 401]]

testing laboratory, after October 24, 1999.\1\ EPCA also directs the 
Department of Energy (DOE or Department) to implement the statutory test 
procedures prescribed for motors, and to require efficiency labeling of 
motors and certification that covered motors comply with the standards.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The term ``manufacture'' means ``to manufacture, produce, 
assemble or import.'' EPCA Sec. 321(10). Thus, the standards apply to 
motors produced, assembled, imported or manufactured after these 
statutory deadlines.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 340(13)(A) of EPCA defines the term ``electric motor'' based 
essentially on the construction and rating system in the National 
Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) Standards Publication MG1. 
Sections 340(13)(B) and (c) of EPCA define the terms ``definite purpose 
motor'' and ``special purpose motor,'' respectively, for which the 
statute prescribes no efficiency standards.
    In its proposed rule to implement the EPCA provisions that apply to 
motors (61 FR 60440, November 27, 1996), DOE has proposed to clarify the 
statutory definition of ``electric motor,'' to mean a machine which 
converts electrical power into rotational mechanical power and which: 
(1) Is a general purpose motor, including motors with explosion-proof 
construction \2\; (2) is a single speed, induction motor; (3) is rated 
for continuous duty operation, or is rated duty type S-1 (IEC) \3\; (4) 
contains a squirrel-cage or cage (IEC) rotor; (5) has foot-mounting, 
including foot-mounting with flanges or detachable feet; (6) is built in 
accordance with NEMA T-frame dimensions, or IEC metric equivalents 
(IEC); (7) has performance in accordance with NEMA Design A or B 
characteristics, or equivalent designs such as IEC Design N (IEC); and 
(8) operates on polyphase alternating current 60-Hertz sinusoidal power, 
and is (i) rated 230 volts or 460 volts, or both, including any motor 
that is rated at multi-voltages that include 230 volts or 460 volts, or 
(ii) can be operated on 230 volts or 460 volts, or both.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Section 342(b)(1) of EPCA recognizes that EPCA's efficiency 
standards cover ``motors which require listing or certification by a 
nationally recognized safety testing laboratory.'' This applies, for 
example, to explosion-proof motors which are otherwise general purpose 
motors.
    \3\ Terms followed by the parenthetical ``IEC'' are referred to in 
the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Standard 34-1. Such 
terms are included in DOE's proposed definition of ``electric motor'' 
because DOE believes EPCA's efficiency requirements apply to metric 
system motors that conform to IEC Standard 34, and that are identical or 
equivalent to motors constructed in accordance with NEMA MG1 and covered 
by the statute.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Notwithstanding the clarification provided in the proposed rule, 
there still appears to be uncertainty as to which motors EPCA covers. It 
is widely understood that the statute covers ``general purpose'' motors 
that are manufactured for a variety of applications, and that meet 
EPCA's definition of ``electric motor.'' Many modifications, however, 
can be made to such generic motors. Motor manufacturers have expressed 
concern as to precisely which motors with such modifications are covered 
under the statute, and as to whether manufacturers will be able to 
comply with the statute by October 25, 1997 with respect to all of these 
covered motors. Consequently, motor manufacturers have requested that 
the Department provide additional guidance as to which types of motors 
are ``electric motors,'' ``definite purpose motors,'' and ``special 
purpose motors'' under EPCA. The policy statement that follows is based 
upon input from motor manufacturers and energy efficiency advocates, and 
provides such guidance.

    II. Guidelines for Determining Whether a Motor Is Covered by EPCA

                               A. General

    EPCA specifies minimum nominal full-load energy efficiency standards 
for 1 to 200 horsepower electric motors, and, to measure compliance with 
those standards, prescribes use of the test procedures in NEMA Standard 
MG1 and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc., (IEEE) 
Standard 112. In DOE's view, as stated in Assistant Secretary Ervin's 
letter of May 9, 1996, to NEMA's Malcolm O'Hagan, until DOE's 
regulations become effective, manufacturers can establish compliance 
with these EPCA requirements through use of competent and reliable 
procedures or methods that give reasonable assurance of such compliance. 
So long as these criteria are met, manufacturers may conduct required 
testing in their own laboratories or in independent laboratories, and 
may employ alternative correlation methods (in lieu of actual testing) 
for some motors. Manufacturers may also establish their compliance with 
EPCA standards and test procedures through use of third party 
certification or verification programs such as those recognized by 
Natural Resources Canada. Labeling and certification requirements will 
become effective only after DOE has promulgated a final rule prescribing 
such requirements.
    Motors with features or characteristics that do not meet the 
statutory definition of ``electric motor'' are not covered, and 
therefore are not required to meet EPCA requirements. Examples include 
motors without feet and without provisions for feet, and variable speed 
motors operated on a variable

[[Page 402]]

frequency power supply. Similarly, multi speed motors and variable speed 
motors, such as inverter duty motors, are not covered equipment, based 
on their intrinsic design for use at variable speeds. However, NEMA 
Design A or B motors that are single speed, meet all other criteria 
under the definitions in EPCA for covered equipment, and can be used 
with an inverter in variable speed applications as an additional 
feature, are covered equipment under EPCA. In other words, being 
suitable for use on an inverter by itself does not exempt a motor from 
EPCA requirements.
    Section 340(13)(F) of EPCA, defines a ``small electric motor'' as 
``a NEMA general purpose alternating current single-speed induction 
motor, built in a two-digit frame number series in accordance with NEMA 
Standards Publication MG 1-1987.'' Section 346 of EPCA requires DOE to 
prescribe testing requirements and efficiency standards only for those 
small electric motors for which the Secretary determines that standards 
are warranted. The Department has not yet made such a determination.

                         B. Electrical Features

    As noted above, the Department's proposed definition of ``electric 
motor'' provides in part that it is a motor that ``operates on polyphase 
alternating current 60-Hertz sinusoidal power, and * * * can be operated 
on 230 volts or 460 volts, or both.'' In DOE's view, ``can be operated'' 
implicitly means that the motor can be operated successfully. According 
to NEMA Standards Publication MG1-1993, paragraph 12.44, ``Variations 
from Rated Voltage and Rated Frequency,'' alternating-current motors 
must operate successfully under running conditions at rated load with a 
variation in the voltage or the frequency up to the following: Plus or 
minus 10 percent of rated voltage, with rated frequency for induction 
motors; \4\ plus or minus 5 percent of rated frequency, with rated 
voltage; and a combined variation in voltage and frequency of 10 percent 
(sum of absolute values) of the rated values, provided the frequency 
variation does not exceed plus or minus 5 percent of rated frequency. 
DOE believes that, for purposes of determining whether a motor meets 
EPCA's definition of ``electric motor,'' these criteria should be used 
to determine when a motor that is not rated at 230 or 460 volts or 60 
Hertz can be operated at such voltage and frequency.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ For example, a motor that is rated at 220 volts should operate 
successfully on 230 volts, since 220 + .10(220) = 242 volts. A 208 volt 
motor, however, would not be expected to operate successfully on 230 
volts, since 208 + .10(208) = 228.8 volts.
    \5\ The Department understands that a motor that can operate at such 
voltage and frequency, based on variations defined for successful 
operation, will not necessarily perform in accordance with the industry 
standards established for operation at the motor's rated voltage and 
frequency. In addition, under the test procedures prescribed by EPCA, 
motors are to be tested at their rated values. Therefore, in DOE's view 
a motor that is not rated for 230 or 460 volts, or 60 Hertz, but that 
can be successfully operated at these levels, must meet the energy 
efficiency requirements at its rated voltage(s) and frequency. DOE also 
notes that when a motor is rated to include a wider voltage range that 
includes 230/460 volts, the motor should meet the energy efficiency 
requirements at 230 volts or 460 volts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NEMA Standards Publication MG1 categorizes electrical modifications 
to motors according to performance characteristics that include locked 
rotor torque, breakdown torque, pull-up torque, locked rotor current, 
and slip at rated load, and assigns design letters, such as Design A, B, 
C, D, or E, to identify various combinations of such electrical 
performance characteristics. Under Section 340(13)(A) of EPCA, electric 
motors subject to EPCA efficiency requirements include only motors that 
fall within NEMA ``Design A and B * * * as defined in [NEMA] Standards 
Publication MG1-1987.'' As to locked rotor torque, for example, MG1 
specifies a minimum performance value for a Design A or B motor of a 
given speed and horsepower, and somewhat higher minimum values for 
Design C and D motors of the same speed and horsepower. The Department 
understands that, under MG1, the industry classifies a motor as Design A 
or B if it has a locked rotor torque at or above the minimum for A and B 
but below the minimum for Design C, so long as it otherwise meets the 
criteria for Design A or B. Therefore, in the Department's view, such a 
motor is covered by EPCA's requirements for electric motors. By contrast 
a motor that meets or exceeds the minimum locked rotor torque for Design 
C or D is not covered by EPCA. In sum, if a motor has electrical 
modifications that meet Design A or B performance requirements it is 
covered by EPCA, and if its characteristics meet Design C, D or E it is 
not covered.

                                 C. Size

    Motors designed for use on a particular type of application which 
are in a frame size that is one or more frame series larger than the 
frame size assigned to that rating by sections 1.2 and 1.3 of NEMA 
Standards Publication MG 13-1984 (R1990), ``Frame Assignments for 
Alternating Current Integral-Horsepower Induction Motors,'' are not, in 
the Department's view, usable in most general purpose applications. This 
is due to the physical size increase associated with a frame series

[[Page 403]]

change. A frame series is defined as the first two digits of the frame 
size designation. For example, 324T and 326T are both in the same frame 
series, while 364T is in the next larger frame series. Hence, in the 
Department's view, a motor that is of a larger frame series than 
normally assigned to that standard rating of motor is not covered by 
EPCA. A physically larger motor within the same frame series would be 
covered, however, because it would be usable in most general purpose 
applications.
    Motors built in a T-frame series or a T-frame size smaller than that 
assigned by MG 13-1984 (R1990) are also considered usable in most 
general purpose applications. This is because simple modifications can 
generally be made to fit a smaller motor in place of a motor with a 
larger frame size assigned in conformity with NEMA MG 13. Therefore, DOE 
believes that such smaller motors are covered by EPCA.

                          D. Motors With Seals

    Some electric motors have seals to prevent ingress of water, dust, 
oil, and other foreign materials into the motor. DOE understands that, 
typically, a manufacturer will add seals to a motor that it 
manufactures, so that it will sell two motors that are identical except 
that one has seals and the other does not. In such a situation, if the 
motor without seals is ``general purpose'' and covered by EPCA's 
efficiency requirements, then the motor with seals will also be covered 
because it can still be used in most general purpose applications. DOE 
understands, however, that manufacturers previously believed motors with 
seals were not covered under EPCA, in part because IEEE Standard 112, 
``Test Procedure for Polyphase Induction Motors and Generators,'' 
prescribed by EPCA, does not address how to test a motor with seals 
installed.
    The efficiency rating of such a motor, if determined with seals 
installed and when the motor is new, apparently would significantly 
understate the efficiency of the motor as operated. New seals are stiff, 
and provide friction that is absent after their initial break-in period. 
DOE understands that, after this initial period, the efficiency ratings 
determined for the same motor with and without seals would be virtually 
identical. To construe EPCA, therefore, as requiring such separate 
efficiency determinations would impose an unnecessary burden on 
manufacturers.
    In light of the foregoing, the Department believes that EPCA 
generally permits the efficiency of a motor with seals to be determined 
without the seals installed. Furthermore, notwithstanding the prior 
belief that such motors are not covered by EPCA, use of this approach to 
determining efficiency will enable manufacturers to meet EPCA's 
standards with respect to covered motors with seals by the date the 
standards go into effect on October 25, 1997.

   III. Discussion of How DOE Would Apply EPCA Definitions, Using the 
                          Foregoing Guidelines

    Using the foregoing guidelines, the attached matrix provides DOE's 
view as to which motors with common features are covered by EPCA. 
Because manufacturers produce many basic models that have many 
modifications of generic general purpose motors, the Department does not 
represent that the matrix is all-inclusive. Rather it is a set of 
examples demonstrating how DOE would apply EPCA definitions, as 
construed by the above guidelines, to various motor types. By extension 
of these examples, most motors currently in production, or to be 
designed in the future, could probably be classified. The matrix 
classifies motors into five categories, which are discussed in the 
following passages.
    Category I--For ``electric motors'' (manufactured alone or as a 
component of another piece of equipment) in Category I, DOE will enforce 
EPCA efficiency standards and test procedures beginning on October 25, 
1997.
    The Department understands that some motors essentially are 
relatively simple modifications of generic general purpose motors. 
Modifications could consist, for example, of minor changes such as the 
addition of temperature sensors or a heater, the addition of a shaft 
extension and a brake disk from a kit, or changes in exterior features 
such as the motor housing. Such motors can still be used for most 
general purpose applications, and the modifications have little or no 
effect on motor performance. Nor do the modifications affect energy 
efficiency.
    Category II--For certain motors that are ``definite purpose'' 
according to present industry practice, but that can be used in most 
general purpose applications, DOE will generally enforce EPCA efficiency 
standards and test procedures beginning no later than October 25, 1999.

                            General Statement

    EPCA does not prescribe standards and test procedures for ``definite 
purpose motors.'' Section 340(13)(B) of EPCA defines the term ``definite 
purpose motor'' as ``any motor designed in standard ratings with 
standard operating characteristics or standard mechanical construction 
for use under service conditions other than usual or for use on a 
particular type of application and which cannot be used in most general 
purpose applications.'' [Emphasis added.] Except, significantly, for 
exclusion of the italicized language, the industry definition of 
``definite purpose motor,'' set forth in NEMA MG1, is identical to the 
foregoing.

[[Page 404]]

    Category II consists of electric motors with horsepower ratings that 
fall between the horsepower ratings in Section 342(b)(1) of EPCA, 
thermally protected motors, and motors with roller bearings. As with 
motors in Category I, these motors are essentially modifications of 
generic general purpose motors. Generally, however, the modifications 
contained in these motors are more extensive and complex than the 
modifications in Category I motors. These Category II motors have been 
considered ``definite purpose'' in common industry parlance, but are 
covered equipment under EPCA because they can be used in most general 
purpose applications.
    According to statements provided during the January 15, 1997, Public 
Hearing, Tr. pgs. 238-239, Category II motors were, until recently, 
viewed by most manufacturers as definite purpose motors, consistent with 
the industry definition that did not contain the clause ``which cannot 
be used in most general purpose applications.'' Hence, DOE understands 
that many manufacturers assumed these motors were not subject to EPCA's 
efficiency standards. During the period prior and subsequent to the 
hearing, discussions among manufacturers resulted in a new understanding 
that such motors are general purpose under EPCA, since they can be used 
in most general purpose applications. Thus, the industry only recently 
recognized that such motors are covered under EPCA. Although the 
statutory definition adopted in 1992 contained the above-quoted 
definition of ``definite purpose,'' the delay in issuing regulations 
which embody this definition may have contributed to industry's delay in 
recognizing that these motors are covered.
    The Department understands that redesign and testing these motors in 
order to meet the efficiency standards in the statute may require a 
substantial amount of time. Given the recent recognition that they are 
covered, it is not realistic to expect these motors will be able to 
comply by October 25, 1997. A substantial period beyond that will be 
required. Moreover, the Department believes different manufacturers will 
need to take different approaches to achieving compliance with respect 
to these motors, and that, for a particular type of motor, some 
manufacturers will be able to comply sooner than others. Thus, the 
Department intends to refrain from taking enforcement action for two 
years, until October 25, 1999, with respect to motors with horsepower 
ratings that fall between the horsepower ratings in Section 342(b)(1) of 
EPCA, thermally protected motors, and motors with roller bearings. 
Manufacturers are encouraged, however, to manufacture these motors in 
compliance with EPCA at the earliest possible date.
    The following sets forth in greater detail, for each of these types 
of motors, the basis for the Department's policy to refrain from 
enforcement for two years. Also set forth is additional explanation of 
the Department's understanding as to why manufacturers previously 
believed intermediate horsepower motors were not covered by EPCA.

                     Intermediate Horsepower Ratings

    Section 342(b)(1) of EPCA specifies efficiency standards for 
electric motors with 19 specific horsepower ratings, ranging from one 
through 200 horsepower. Each is a preferred or standardized horsepower 
rating as reflected in the table in NEMA Standards Publication MG1-1993, 
paragraph 10.32.4, Polyphase Medium Induction Motors. However, an 
``electric motor,'' as defined by EPCA, can be built at other horsepower 
ratings, such as 6 horsepower, 65 horsepower, or 175 horsepower. Such 
motors, rated at horsepower levels between any two adjacent horsepower 
ratings identified in Section 342(b)(1) of EPCA will be referred to as 
``intermediate horsepower motors.'' In the Department's view, efficiency 
standards apply to every motor that has a rating from one through 200 
horsepower (or kilowatt equivalents), and that otherwise meets the 
criteria for an ``electric motor'' under EPCA, including an electric 
motor with an intermediate horsepower (or kW) rating.
    To date, these motors have typically been designed in conjunction 
with and supplied to a specific customer to fulfill certain performance 
and design requirements of a particular application, as for example to 
run a certain type of equipment. See the discussion in Section IV below 
on ``original equipment'' and ``original equipment manufacturers.'' In 
large part for these reasons, manufacturers believed intermediate 
horsepower motors to be ``definite purpose motors'' that were not 
covered by EPCA. Despite their specific uses, however, these motors are 
electric motors under EPCA when they are capable of being used in most 
general purpose applications.
    Features of a motor that are directly related to its horsepower 
rating include its physical size, and the ratings of its controller and 
protective devices. These aspects of a 175 horsepower motor, for 
example, which is an intermediate horsepower motor, must be appropriate 
to that horsepower, and would generally differ from the same aspects of 
150 and 200 horsepower motors, the two standard horsepower ratings 
closest to 175. To re-design an existing intermediate horsepower 
electric motor so that it complies with EPCA could involve all of these 
elements of a motor's design. For example, the addition of material 
necessary to achieve EPCA's prescribed level of efficiency could cause 
the size of the motor to increase. The addition of magnetic material 
would invite higher inrush current that could cause an incorrectly sized 
motor controller to malfunction, or the circuit breaker with a standard

[[Page 405]]

rating to trip unnecessarily, or both. The Department believes motor 
manufacturers will require a substantial amount of time to redesign and 
retest each intermediate horsepower electric motor they manufacture.
    To the extent such intermediate horsepower electric motors become 
unavailable because motor manufacturers have recognized only recently 
that they are covered by EPCA, equipment in which they are incorporated 
would temporarily become unavailable also. Moreover, re-design of such a 
motor to comply with EPCA could cause changes in the motor that require 
re-design of the equipment in which the motor is used. For example, if 
an intermediate horsepower electric motor becomes larger, it might no 
longer fit in the equipment for which it was designed. In such 
instances, the equipment would have to be re-designed. Because these 
motors were previously thought not to be covered, equipment 
manufacturers may not have had sufficient lead time to make the 
necessary changes to the equipment without interrupting its production.
    With respect to intermediate horsepower motors, the Department 
intends to refrain from enforcing EPCA for a period of 24 months only as 
to such motor designs that were being manufactured prior to the date 
this Policy Statement was issued. The Department is concerned that small 
adjustments could be made to the horsepower rating of an existing 
electric motor, in an effort to delay compliance with EPCA, if it 
delayed enforcement as to all intermediate horsepower motors produced 
during the 24 month period. For example, a 50 horsepower motor that has 
a service factor of 1.15 could be renameplated as a 57\1/2\ horsepower 
motor that has a 1.0 service factor. By making this delay in enforcement 
applicable only to pre-existing designs of intermediate horsepower 
motors, the Department believes it has made adequate provision for the 
manufacture of bona fide intermediate horsepower motor designs that 
cannot be changed to be in compliance with EPCA by October 25, 1997.

                       Thermally Protected Motors

    The Department understands that in order to redesign a thermally 
protected motor to improve its efficiency so that it complies with EPCA, 
various changes in the windings must be made which will require the 
thermal protector to be re-selected. Such devices sense the inrush and 
running current of the motor, as well as the operating temperature. Any 
changes to a motor that affect these characteristics will prevent the 
protector from operating correctly. When a new protector is selected, 
the motor must be tested to verify proper operation of the device in the 
motor. The motor manufacturer would test the locked rotor and overload 
conditions, which could take several days, and the results may dictate 
that a second selection is needed with additional testing. When the 
manufacturer has finished testing, typically the manufacturer will have 
a third party conduct additional testing. This testing may include 
cycling the motor in a locked-rotor condition to verify that the 
protector functions properly. This testing may take days or even weeks 
to perform for a particular model of motor.
    Since it was only recently recognized by industry that these motors 
are covered by EPCA, in the Department's view the total testing program 
makes it impossible for manufacturers to comply with the EPCA efficiency 
levels in thermally protected motors by October 25, 1997, especially 
since each different motor winding must be tested and motor winding/
thermal protector combinations number in the thousands.

                       Motors With Roller Bearings

    Motors with roller bearings fit within the definition of electric 
motor under the statute. However, because the IEEE Standard 112 Test 
Method B does not provide measures to test motors with roller bearings 
installed, manufacturers mistakenly believed such motors were not 
covered. Under IEEE Standard 112, a motor with roller bearings could 
only be tested for efficiency with the roller bearings removed and 
standard ball bearings installed as temporary substitutes. Then on the 
basis of the energy efficiency information gained from that test, the 
manufacturer may need to redesign the motor in order to comply with the 
statute. In this situation, the Department understands that testing, 
redesigning, and retesting lines of motors with roller bearings, to 
establish compliance, would be difficult and time consuming.
    Categories III, IV and V--Motors not within EPCA's definition of 
``electric motor,'' and not covered by EPCA.

                        Close-Coupled Pump Motors

    NEMA Standards Publication MG1-1993, with revisions one through 
three, Part 18, ``Definite-Purpose Machines,'' defines ``a face-mounting 
close-coupled pump motor'' as ``a medium alternating-current squirrel-
cage induction open or totally enclosed motor, with or without feet, 
having a shaft suitable for mounting an impeller and sealing device.'' 
Paragraphs MG1-18.601-18.614 specify its performance, face and shaft 
mounting dimensions, and frame assignments that replace the suffix 
letters T and TS with the suffix letters JM and JP.
    The Department understands that such motors are designed in standard 
ratings with standard operating characteristics for use in certain 
close-coupled pumps and pumping applications, but cannot be used in non-
pumping applications, such as, for example, conveyors. Consequently, the 
Department

[[Page 406]]

believes close-coupled pump motors are definite-purpose motors not 
covered by EPCA. However, a motor that meets EPCA's definition of 
``electric motor,'' and which can be coupled to a pump, for example by 
means of a C-face or D-flange end shield, as depicted in NEMA Standards 
Publication MG1, Part 4, ``Dimensions, Tolerances, and Mounting,'' is 
covered.

  Totally-Enclosed Non-Ventilated (TENV) and Totally-Enclosed Air-Over 
                              (TEAO) Motors

    A motor designated in NEMA MG1-1993, paragraph MG1-1.26.1, as 
``totally-enclosed non-ventilated (IP54, IC410)'' \6\ is ``not equipped 
for cooling by means external to the enclosing parts.'' This means that 
the motor, when properly applied, does not require the use of any 
additional means of cooling installed external to the motor enclosure. 
The TENV motor is cooled by natural conduction and natural convection of 
the motor heat into the surrounding environment. As stated in NEMA MG1-
1993, Suggested Standard for Future Design, paragraph MG1-1.26.1a, a 
TENV motor ``is only equipped for cooling by free convection.'' The 
general requirement for the installation of the TENV motor is that it 
not be placed in a restricted space that would inhibit this natural 
dissipation of the motor heat. Most general purpose applications use 
motors which include a means for forcing air flow through or around the 
motor and usually through the enclosed space and, therefore, can be used 
in spaces that are more restrictive than those required for TENV motors. 
Placing a TENV motor in such common restricted areas is likely to cause 
the motor to overheat. The TENV motor may also be larger than the motors 
used in most general purpose applications, and would take up more of the 
available space, thus reducing the size of the open area surrounding the 
motor. Installation of a TENV motor might require, therefore, an 
additional means of ventilation to continually exchange the ambient 
around the motor.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ IP refers to the IEC Standard 34-5: Classification of degrees of 
protection provided by enclosures for rotating machines. IC refers to 
the IEC Standard 34-6: Methods of cooling rotating machinery. The IP and 
IC codes are referenced in the NEMA designations for TENV and TEAO 
motors in MG1-1993 Part 1, ``Classification According to Environmental 
Protection and Methods of Cooling,'' as a Suggested Standard for Future 
Design, since the TENV and TEAO motors conform to IEC Standards. Details 
of protection (IP) and methods of cooling (IC) are defined in MG1 Part 5 
and Part 6, respectively.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A motor designated in NEMA MG1-1993 as ``totally-enclosed air-over 
(IP54, IC417)'' is intended to be cooled by ventilation means external 
to (i.e., separate and independent from) the motor, such as a fan. The 
motor must be provided with the additional ventilation to prevent it 
from overheating.
    Consequently, neither the TENV motor nor the TEAO motor would be 
suitable for most general purpose applications, and, DOE believes they 
are definite-purpose motors not covered by EPCA.

                           Integral Gearmotors

    An ``integral gearmotor'' is an assembly of a motor and a specific 
gear drive or assembly of gears, such as a gear reducer, as a unified 
package. The motor portion of an integral gearmotor is not necessarily a 
complete motor, since the end bracket or mounting flange of the motor 
portion is also part of the gear assembly and cannot be operated when 
separated from the complete gear assembly. Typically, an integral 
gearmotor is not manufactured to standard T-frame dimensions specified 
in NEMA MG1. Moreover, neither the motor portion, not the entire 
integral gearmotor, are capable of being used in most general purpose 
applications without significant modifications. An integral gearmotor is 
also designed for a specific purpose and can have unique performance 
characteristics, physical dimensions, and casing, flange and shafting 
configurations. Consequently, integral gearmotors are outside the scope 
of the EPCA definition of ``electric motor'' and are not covered under 
EPCA.
    However, an ``electric motor,'' as defined by EPCA, which is 
connected to a stand alone mechanical gear drive or an assembly of 
gears, such as a gear reducer connected by direct coupling, belts, 
bolts, a kit, or other means, is covered equipment under EPCA.

      IV. Electric Motors That Are Components in Certain Equipment

    The primary function of an electric motor is to convert electrical 
energy to mechanical energy which then directly drives machinery such as 
pumps, fans, or compressors. Thus, an electric motor is always connected 
to a driven machine or apparatus. Typically the motor is incorporated 
into a finished product such as an air conditioner, a refrigerator, a 
machine tool, food processing equipment, or other commercial or 
industrial machinery. These products are commonly known as ``original 
equipment'' or ``end-use equipment,'' and are manufactured by firms 
known as ``original equipment manufacturers'' (OEMs).
    Many types of motors used in original equipment are covered under 
EPCA. As noted above, EPCA prescribes efficiency standards to be met by 
all covered electric motors manufactured after October 24, 1997, except 
that covered motors which require

[[Page 407]]

listing or certification by a nationally recognized safety testing 
laboratory need not meet the standards until after October 24, 1999. 
Thus, for motors that must comply after October 24, 1997, once 
inventories of motors manufactured before the deadline have been 
exhausted, only complying motors would be available for purchase and use 
by OEMs in manufacturing original equipment. Any non-complying motors 
previously included in such equipment would no longer be available.
    The physical, and sometimes operational, characteristics of motors 
that meet EPCA efficiency standards normally differ from the 
characteristics of comparable existing motors that do not meet those 
standards. In part because of such differences, the Department is aware 
of two types of situations where strict application of the October 24, 
1997, deadline could temporarily prevent the manufacture of, and remove 
from the marketplace, currently available original equipment.
    One such situation is where an original equipment manufacturer uses 
an electric motor as a component in end-use equipment that requires 
listing or certification by a nationally recognized safety testing 
laboratory, even though the motor itself does not require listing or 
certification. In some of these instances, the file for listing or 
certification specifies the particular motor to be used. No substitution 
could be made for the motor without review and approval of the new motor 
and the entire system by the safety testing laboratory. Consequently, a 
specified motor that does not meet EPCA standards could not be replaced 
by a complying motor without such review and approval.
    This re-listing or re-certification process is subject to 
substantial variation from one piece of original equipment to the next. 
For some equipment, it could be a simple paperwork transaction between 
the safety listing or certification organization and the OEM, taking 
approximately four to eight weeks to complete. But the process could 
raise more complex system issues involving redesign of the motor or 
piece of equipment, or both, and actual testing to assure that safety 
and performance criteria are met, and could take several months to 
complete. The completion time could also vary depending on the response 
time of the particular safety approval agency. Moreover, in the period 
immediately after October 24, the Department believes wholesale changes 
could occur in equipment lines when OEMs must begin using motors that 
comply with EPCA. These changes are likely to be concentrated in the 
period immediately after EPCA goes into effect on October 24, and if 
many OEMs seek to re-list or re-certify equipment at the same time, 
substantial delays in the review and approval process at the safety 
approval agencies could occur. For these reasons, the Department is 
concerned that certain end-user equipment that requires safety listing 
or certification could become unavailable in the marketplace, because an 
electric motor specifically identified in a listing or certification is 
covered by EPCA and will become unavailable, and the steps have not been 
completed to obtain safety approval of the equipment when manufactured 
with a complying motor.
    Second, a situation could exist where an electric motor covered by 
EPCA is constructed in a T-frame series or T-frame size that is smaller 
(but still standard) than that assigned by NEMA Standards Publication MG 
13-1984 (R1990), sections 1.2 and 1.3, in order to fit into a restricted 
mounting space that is within certain end-use equipment. (Motors in IEC 
metric frame sizes and kilowatt ratings could also be involved in this 
type of situation.) In such cases, the manufacturer of the end-use 
equipment might need to redesign the equipment containing the mounting 
space to accommodate a larger motor that complies with EPCA. These 
circumstances as well could result in certain currently available 
equipment becoming temporarily unavailable in the market, since the 
smaller size motor would become unavailable before the original 
equipment had been re-designed to accommodate the larger, complying 
motor.
    The Department understands that many motor manufacturers and OEMs 
became aware only recently that the electric motors addressed in the 
preceding paragraphs were covered by EPCA. This is largely for the same 
reasons, discussed above, that EPCA coverage of Category II motors was 
only recently recognized. In addition, the Department understands that 
some motor manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers confused 
motors that themselves require safety listing or certification, which 
need not comply until October 25, 1999, with motors that, while not 
subject to such requirements, are included in original equipment that 
requires safety listing or certification. Consequently, motor 
manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers took insufficient 
action to assure that appropriate complying motors would be available 
for the original equipment involved, and that the equipment could 
accommodate such motors. OEMs involved in such situations may often be 
unable to switch to motors that meet EPCA standards in the period 
immediately following October 24. To mitigate any hardship to purchasers 
of the original equipment, the Department intends to refrain from 
enforcing EPCA in certain limited circumstances, under the conditions 
described below.
    Where a particular electric motor is specified in an approved safety 
listing or certification for a piece of original equipment, and the 
motor does not meet the applicable efficiency standard in EPCA, the 
Department's

[[Page 408]]

policy will be as follows: For the period of time necessary for the OEM 
to obtain a revised safety listing or certification for that piece of 
equipment, with a motor specified that complies with EPCA, but in no 
event beyond October 24, 1999, the Department would refrain from taking 
enforcement action under EPCA with respect to manufacture of the motor 
for installation in such original equipment. This policy would apply 
only where the motor has been manufactured and specified in the approved 
safety listing or certification prior to October 25, 1997.
    Where a particular electric motor is used in a piece of original 
equipment and manufactured in a smaller than assigned frame size or 
series, and the motor does not meet the applicable efficiency standard 
in EPCA, the Department's policy will be as follows: For the period of 
time necessary for the OEM to re-design the piece of equipment to 
accommodate a motor that complies with EPCA, but in no event beyond 
October 24, 1999, the Department would refrain from enforcing the 
standard with respect to manufacture of the motor for installation in 
such original equipment. This policy would apply only to a model of 
motor that has been manufactured and included in the original equipment 
prior to October 25, 1997.
    To allow the Department to monitor application of the policy set 
forth in the prior two paragraphs, the Department needs to be informed 
as to the motors being manufactured under the policy. Therefore, each 
motor manufacturer and OEM should jointly notify the Department as to 
each motor they will be manufacturing and using, respectively, after 
October 24, 1997, in the belief that it is covered by the policy. The 
notification should set forth: (1) The name of the motor manufacturer, 
and a description of the motor by type, model number, and date of design 
or production; (2) the name of the original equipment manufacturer, and 
a description of the application where the motor is to be used; (3) the 
safety listing or safety certification organization and the existing 
listing or certification file or document number for which re-listing or 
re-certification will be requested, if applicable; (4) the reason and 
amount of time required for continued production of the motor, with a 
statement that a substitute electric motor that complies with EPCA could 
not be obtained by an earlier date; and (5) the name, address, and 
telephone number of the person to contact for further information. The 
joint request should be signed by a responsible official of each 
requesting company, and sent to: U.S. Department of Energy, Assistant 
Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Office of Building 
Research and Standards, EE-41, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence 
Avenue, SW., Room 1J-018, Washington, DC 20585-0121. The Department does 
not intend to apply this policy to any motor for which it does not 
receive such a notification. Moreover, the Department may use the 
notification, and make further inquiries, to be sure motors listed in 
the notification meet the criteria for application of the policy.
    This part of the Policy Statement will not apply to a motor in 
Category II, discussed above in Section III. Because up to 24 months is 
contemplated for compliance by Category II motors, the Department 
believes any issues that might warrant a delay of enforcement for such 
motors can be addressed during that time period.

                         V. Further Information

    The Department intends to incorporate this Policy Statement into an 
appendix to its final rule to implement the EPCA provisions that apply 
to motors. Any comments or suggestions with respect to this Policy 
Statement, as well as requests for further information, should be 
addressed to the Director, Building Technologies, EE-2J, U.S. Department 
of Energy, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., 
Washington, DC 20585-0121.

<R05>
Sec. 431.76  Uniform test method for the measurement of energy efficiency of commercial warm air furnaces.

    (a) This Section covers the test procedures you must follow if, 
pursuant to EPCA, you are measuring the steady state thermal efficiency 
of a gas-fired

[[Page 417]]

or oil-fired commercial warm air furnace with a rated maximum input of 
225,000 Btu per hour or more. Where this Section prescribes use of ANSI 
standard Z21.47-1998 or UL standard 727-1994, (Incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 431.75), perform only the procedures pertinent to 
the measurement of the steady-state efficiency.
    (b) Test setup--(1) Test setup for gas-fired commercial warm air 
furnaces. The test setup, including flue requirement, instrumentation, 
test conditions, and measurements for determining thermal efficiency is 
as specified in sections 1.1 (Scope), 2.1 (General), 2.2 (Basic Test 
Arrangements), 2.3 (Test Ducts and Plenums), 2.4 (Test Gases), 2.5 (Test 
Pressures and Burner Adjustments), 2.6 (Static Pressure and Air Flow 
Adjustments), 2.38 (Thermal Efficiency), and 4.2.1 (Basic Test 
Arrangements for Direct Vent Control Furnaces) of the ANSI Standard 
Z21.47-1998. The thermal efficiency test must be conducted only at the 
normal inlet test pressure, as specified in Section 2.5.1 of ANSI 
Standard Z21.47-1998, (Incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.75), and 
at the maximum hourly Btu input rating specified by the manufacturer for 
the product being tested.
    (2) Test setup for oil-fired commercial warm air furnaces. The test 
setup, including flue requirement, instrumentation, test condition, and 
measurement for measuring thermal efficiency is as specified in sections 
1 (Scope), 2 (Units of Measurement), 3 (Glossary), 37 (General), 38 and 
39 (Test Installation), 40 (Instrumentation, except 40.4 and 40.6.2 
through 40.6.7, which are not required for the thermal efficiency test), 
41 (Initial Test Conditions), 42 (Combustion Test--Burner and Furnace), 
43.2 (Operation Tests), 44 (Limit Control Cutout Test), 45 (Continuity 
of Operation Test), and 46 (Air Flow, Downflow or Horizontal Furnace 
Test), of the UL Standard 727-1994. You must conduct a fuel oil analysis 
for heating value, hydrogen content, carbon content, pounds per gallon, 
and American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity as specified in Section 
8.2.2 of the HI BTS-2000 (Incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.75). 
The steady-state combustion conditions, specified in Section 42.1 of UL 
Standard 727-1994, (Incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.75), are 
attained when variations of not more than 5 [deg]F in the measured flue 
gas temperature occur for three consecutive readings taken 15 minutes 
apart.
    (c) Additional test measurements--(1) Measurement of flue 
CO<INF>2</INF> (carbon dioxide) for oil-fired commercial warm air 
furnaces. In addition to the flue temperature measurement specified in 
Section 40.6.8 of UL Standard 727-1994, (Incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 431.75) you must locate one or two sampling tubes within six 
inches downstream from the flue temperature probe (as indicated on 
Figure 40.3 of UL Standard 727-1994) (Incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 431.75). If you use an open end tube, it must project into the 
flue one-third of the chimney connector diameter. If you use other 
methods of sampling CO<INF>2</INF>, you must place the sampling tube so 
as to obtain an average sample. There must be no air leak between the 
temperature probe and the sampling tube location. You must collect the 
flue gas sample at the same time the flue gas temperature is recorded. 
The CO<INF>2</INF> concentration of the flue gas must be as specified by 
the manufacturer for the product being tested, with a tolerance of 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.1 percent. You must determine the flue 
CO<INF>2</INF> using an instrument with a reading error no greater than 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.1 percent.
    (2) Procedure for the measurement of condensate for a gas-fired 
condensing commercial warm air furnace. The test procedure for the 
measurement of the condensate from the flue gas under steady state 
operation must be conducted as specified in sections 7.2.2.4, 7.8 and 
9.2 of the ASHRAE Standard 103-1993 (Incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 431.75) under the maximum rated input conditions. You must conduct 
this condensate measurement for an additional 30 minutes of steady state 
operation after completion of the steady state thermal efficiency test 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Calculations of thermal efficiency--(1) Gas-fired commercial 
warm air furnaces. You must use the calculation procedure specified in 
Section 2.38, Thermal Efficiency, of ANSI Standard Z21.47-1998 
(Incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.75).

[[Page 418]]

    (2) Oil-fired commercial warm air furnaces. You must calculate the 
percent flue loss (in percent of heat input rate) by following the 
procedure specified in sections 11.1.4, 11.1.5, and 11.1.6.2 of the HI 
BTS-2000 (Incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.75). The thermal 
efficiency must be calculated as:

Thermal Efficiency (percent) = 100 percent - flue loss (in percent).

    (e) Procedure for the calculation of the additional heat gain and 
heat loss, and adjustment to the thermal efficiency, for a condensing 
commercial warm air furnace. (1) You must calculate the latent heat gain 
from the condensation of the water vapor in the flue gas, and calculate 
heat loss due to the flue condensate down the drain, as specified in 
sections 11.3.7.1 and 11.3.7.2 of ASHRAE Standard 103-1993, 
(Incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.75), with the exception that 
in the equation for the heat loss due to hot condensate flowing down the 
drain in Section 11.3.7.2, the assumed indoor temperature of 70 [deg]F 
and the temperature term T<INF>OA</INF> must be replaced by the measured 
room temperature as specified in Section 2.2.8 of ANSI Standard Z21.47-
1998 (Incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.75).
    (2) Adjustment to the Thermal Efficiency for Condensing Furnace. You 
must adjust the thermal efficiency as calculated in paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section by adding the latent gain, expressed in percent, from the 
condensation of the water vapor in the flue gas, and subtracting the 
heat loss (due to the flue condensate down the drain), also expressed in 
percent, both as calculated in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, to 
obtain the thermal efficiency of a condensing furnace.

<R05>
Sec. 431.86  Uniform test method for the measurement of energy efficiency of commercial packaged boilers.

    (a) Scope. This section provides test procedures that must be 
followed for measuring, pursuant to EPCA, the steady state combustion 
efficiency of a gas-fired or oil-fired commercial packaged boiler. These 
test procedures apply to packaged low pressure boilers that have rated 
input capacities of 300,000 Btu/hr or more and are ``commercial packaged 
boilers, but do not apply under EPCA to ``packaged high pressure 
boilers.''
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the Department 
incorporates by reference the definitions specified in Section 3.0 of 
the HI BTS-2000 (Incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.85), with the 
exception of the definition for the terms ``packaged boiler'', 
``condensing boilers'', and ``packaged low pressure steam'' and ``hot 
water boiler''.
    (c) Test Method for Commercial Packaged Boilers--General. After 
October 23, 2006, follow the provisions in this paragraph (c) for all 
testing of packaged low pressure boilers that are commercial packaged 
boilers. Prior to that date, follow either the provisions of this 
paragraph (c) or of paragraph (d) of this section to test steel boilers, 
but follow the provisions of this paragraph for all other commercial 
packaged boilers.
    (1) Test Setup--(i) Classifications: If employing boiler 
classification, you must classify boilers as given in Section 4.0 of the 
HI BTS-2000 (Incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.85).
    (ii) Requirements: Conduct the combustion efficiency test as given 
in Section 5.2 (Combustion Efficiency Test) of the HI BTS-2000 
(Incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.85).
    (iii) Instruments and Apparatus:
    (A) Follow the requirements for instruments and apparatus in 
sections 6 (Instruments) and 7 (Apparatus), of the HI BTS-2000 
(Incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.85), with the exception of 
section 7.2.5 (flue connection for outdoor boilers) which is replaced 
with paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section:
    (B) Flue Connection for Outdoor Boilers: For oil-fired and power gas 
outdoor boilers, the integral venting means may have to be revised to 
permit connecting the test flue apparatus described in section 7.2.1 of 
BTS-2000. A gas-fired boiler for outdoor installation with a venting 
system provided as part of the boiler must be tested with the venting 
system in place.
    (iv) Test Conditions: Use test conditions from Section 8.0 
(excluding 8.5.2, 8.5.3, and 8.6.2) of HI BTS-2000 (Incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 431.85) for the combustion efficiency testing, and 
use paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(A) of this section when testing a condensing 
boiler:
    (A) Water Temperatures for Condensing Boilers--For condensing 
boilers the outlet temperature shall be 180 [deg]F<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 [deg]F and the inlet temperature shall be 80 
[deg]F<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F at all times during the test. (See 
also paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section for condensing 
boilers.).
    (B) [Reserved]
    (2) Test Measurements. (i) Measure for combustion efficiency 
according to sections 9.1 (excluding sections 9.1.1.2.3 and 9.1.2.2.3), 
9.2 and 10.2 of the HI BTS-2000 (Incorporated by reference, see Sec. 
431.85), except that for condensing boilers, replace the boiler water 
inlet temperature in section 9.1.2.1.4 of the HI BTS-2000 standard with 
the inlet temperature specified in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(A) of this 
section.
    (ii) Procedure for the Measurement of Condensate for a Condensing 
Boiler. Collect flue condensate as specified in Section 9.2.2 of HI BTS-
2000 (Incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.85). Measure the 
condensate from the flue gas under steady state operation for the 30 
minute collection period during the 30 minute steady state combustion 
efficiency test. Flue condensate mass shall

[[Page 421]]

be measured immediately at the end of the 30 minute collection period to 
prevent evaporation loss from the sample. The humidity of the room shall 
at no time exceed 80 percent. Determine the mass of flue condensate for 
the steady state period by subtracting the tare container weight from 
the total container and flue condensate weight measured at the end of 
the test period.
    (iii) A Boiler That is Capable of Supplying Either Steam or Hot 
Water--(A) Testing. For purposes of EPCA, measure the combustion 
efficiency of a commercial packaged boiler capable of supplying either 
steam or hot water either by testing the boiler in the steam mode or by 
testing it in both the steam and hot water modes.
    (B) Rating. If testing the boiler only in the steam mode, use the 
efficiency determined from such testing to rate the boiler for both the 
steam and water modes. If testing the boiler in both modes, rate the 
boiler's efficiency for each mode based on the testing in that mode.
    (3) Calculation of Combustion Efficiency. Use the calculation 
procedure for the combustion efficiency test specified in Section 11.2 
(including the specified subsections of 11.1) of the HI BTS-2000 
(Incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.85).
    (d) Steel Commercial Packaged Boilers--Alternative Test Method. 
Until October 23, 2006, follow either the provisions of this paragraph 
(d), or of paragraph (c) of this section, to test steel commercial 
packaged boilers.
    (1) Test setup. Instead of using HI BTS-2000 as specified in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, conduct the combustion efficiency test 
for steel packaged low pressure boilers that are commercial packaged 
boilers using the Abbreviated Efficiency Test (Simplified Efficiency 
Test or The Short Form) as specified in ASME PTC 4.1 (Incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 431.85). If selecting the ASME PTC 4.1 procedure 
for conducting the required combustion efficiency test for steel 
boilers, conduct the test under conditions as specified in paragraphs 
(d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) Use the test procedure for the efficiency test from ASME PTC 4.1 
(Incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.85). Conduct the combustion 
efficiency test with the Abbreviated Efficiency Test (Simplified 
Efficiency Test or The Short Form) for gas and oil fuels described in 
Section 1.07 of ASME PTC 4.1 (Incorporated by reference, see Sec. 
431.85).
    (ii) Test Conditions for the Combustion Efficiency.
    (A) Steam pressure for steam boilers--Test must be made at 
atmospheric pressure or at a pressure not exceeding 2 psig.
    (B) Water temperature for hot water boilers--The inlet temperature 
must be 35 [deg]F to 80 [deg]F, except that when a boiler is tested in 
the field after installation the inlet temperature may be as recommended 
by the manufacturer, but must not exceed 140 [deg]F. The outlet 
temperature shall be 180 [deg]F <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 [deg]F.
    (C) After steady state operation is achieved, the minimum duration 
of a test run shall be 30 minutes.
    (2) Test Measurements. Use the test procedure from Section 5, 
Efficiency by Heat Loss Method, of ASME PTC 4.1 (Incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 431.85). Use the test conditions as specified in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section. For a boiler that is capable of 
supplying either steam or hot water, follow paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of 
this section.
    (3) Calculation of Combustion Efficiency. Use the heat loss method 
for gas or oil fuel as specified in Section 7.3 and the Test Forms for 
the Abbreviated Efficiency Test, PTC 4.1-a (Summary Sheet) and PTC 4.1-b 
(Calculation Sheet), of ASME PTC 4.1 to determine the combustion 
efficiency, except that the following specific heat loss terms (as 
listed in Section 7.3 of ASME PTC 4.1) to 0: sections 7.3.2.03 (moisture 
in fuel), 7.3.2.01 (combustible in dry refuse), 7.3.2.10 (radiation to 
surroundings), 7.3.2.05 through 7.3.2.09 and 7.3.2.11 through 7.3.2.14 
(unmeasured losses) must be set. (Incorporated by reference, see Sec. 
431.85)

\1\ For equipment rated according to the ARI standards, all EER values must be rated at 95 [deg]F outdoor dry-bulb temperature for air-cooled products
  and evaporatively-cooled products and at 85 [deg]F entering water temperature for water-cooled products. For water-source heat pumps rated according
  to the ISO standard, EER must be rated at 30 [deg]C (86 [deg]F) entering water temperature.
\2\ Deduct 0.2 from the required EER for units with heating sections other than electric resistance heat.
\3\ Effective 10/29/2004, the minimum value becomes EER = 11.0.

Sec. 431.102  Definitions concerning commercial water heaters, hot water supply boilers, and unfired hot water storage tanks.

    The following definitions apply for purposes of this subpart G, and 
of subparts J through M of this part. Any words or terms not defined in 
this section or elsewhere in this part shall be defined as provided in 
section 340 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 6311.
    ASTM-D-2156-80 means the test standard published in 1980 by the 
American Society of Testing and Measurements and titled Method for Smoke 
Density in Flue Gases from Burning Distillate Fuels.
    Hot water supply boiler means a packaged boiler that is industrial 
equipment and that,
    (1) Has an input rating from 300,000 Btu/hr to 12,500,000 Btu/hr and 
of at least 4,000 Btu/hr per gallon of stored water,
    (2) Is suitable for heating potable water, and
    (3) Meets either or both of the following conditions:
    (i) It has the temperature and pressure controls necessary for 
heating potable water for purposes other than space heating, or
    (ii) The manufacturer's product literature, product markings, 
product marketing, or product installation and operation instructions 
indicate that the boiler's intended uses include heating potable water 
for purposes other than space heating.
    Instantaneous water heater means a water heater that has an input 
rating not less than 4,000 Btu/hr per gallon of stored water, and that 
is industrial equipment, including products meeting this description 
that are designed to heat water to temperatures of 180 [deg]F or higher.
    Packaged boiler means a boiler that is shipped complete with heating 
equipment, mechanical draft equipment and automatic controls; usually 
shipped in one or more sections and does not include a boiler that is 
custom designed and field constructed. If the boiler is shipped in more 
than one section, the sections may be produced by more than one 
manufacturer, and may be originated or shipped at different times and 
from more than one location.
    R-value means the thermal resistance of insulating material as 
determined based on ASTM Standard Test Method C177-97 or C518-91 and 
expressed in ( [deg]F[middot]ft\2\[middot]h/Btu).
    Standby loss means the average hourly energy required to maintain 
the stored water temperature, expressed as applicable either (1) as a 
percentage (per hour) of the heat content of the stored water and 
determined by the formula for S given in Section 2.10 of ANSI Z21.10.3-
1998, denoted by the term ``S,'' or (2) in Btu per hour based on a 70 
[deg]F temperature differential between stored water and the ambient 
temperature, denoted by the term ``SL.''
    Storage water heater means a water heater that heats and stores 
water within the appliance at a thermostatically controlled temperature 
for delivery on demand and that is industrial equipment. Such term does 
not include units with an input rating of 4,000 Btu/hr or more per 
gallon of stored water.
    Tank surface area means, for the purpose of determining portions of 
a tank requiring insulation, those areas of a storage tank, including 
hand holes and manholes, in its uninsulated or pre-insulated state, that 
do not have pipe penetrations or tank supports attached.
    Thermal efficiency for an instantaneous water heater, a storage 
water heater or a hot water supply boiler means the ratio of the heat 
transferred to the water flowing through the water heater to the amount 
of energy consumed by the water heater as measured during the thermal 
efficiency test procedure prescribed in this subpart.
    Unfired hot water storage tank means a tank used to store water that 
is heated externally, and that is industrial equipment.

Policy and Conservation Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6311-6317.


<R05>
Sec. 431.132  Definitions concerning automatic commercial ice makers.

    Automatic commercial ice maker means a factory-made assembly (not 
necessarily shipped in 1 package) that--
    (1) Consists of a condensing unit and ice-making section operating 
as an integrated unit, with means for making and harvesting ice; and
    (2) May include means for storing ice, dispensing ice, or storing 
and dispensing ice.
    Basic model means, with respect to automatic commercial ice makers, 
all units of a given type of automatic commercial ice maker (or class 
thereof) manufactured by one manufacturer and which have the same 
primary energy source, which have electrical characteristics that are 
essentially identical, and which do not have any differing electrical, 
physical, or functional characteristics that affect energy consumption.
    Cube type ice means ice that is fairly uniform, hard, solid, usually 
clear, and generally weighs less than two ounces (60 grams) per piece, 
as distinguished from flake, crushed, or fragmented ice.
    Energy use means the total energy consumed, stated in kilowatt hours 
per one-hundred pounds (kWh/100 lb) of ice and stated in multiples of 
0.1. For remote condensing automatic commercial ice makers, total energy 
consumed shall include condenser fan power.
    Harvest rate means the amount of ice (at 32 degrees F) in pounds 
produced per 24 hours.
    Ice-making head means automatic commercial ice makers that do not 
contain integral storage bins, but are generally designed to accommodate 
a variety of bin capacities. Storage bins entail additional energy use 
not included in the reported energy consumption figures for these units.
    Maximum condenser water use means the maximum amount of water used 
by the condensing unit (if water-cooled), stated in gallons per 100 
pounds (gal/100 lb) of ice, in multiples of 1.
    Remote compressor means a type of automatic commercial ice maker in

[[Page 431]]

which the ice-making mechanism and compressor are in separate sections.
    Remote condensing means a type of automatic commercial ice maker in 
which the ice-making mechanism and condenser or condensing unit are in 
separate sections.
    Self-contained means a type of automatic commercial ice maker in 
which the ice-making mechanism and storage compartment are in an 
integral cabinet.

Sec. 431.134  Uniform test methods for the measurement of energy consumption and water consumption of automatic commercial ice makers.

    (a) Scope. This section provides the test procedures for measuring, 
pursuant to EPCA, the energy use in kilowatt hours per 100 pounds of ice 
(kWh/100 lbs ice) and the condenser water use in gallons per 100 pounds 
of ice (gal/100 lbs ice).
    (b) Testing and Calculations. Determine the energy consumed and the 
condenser water use rate of each covered product by conducting the test 
procedures, set forth in the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration 
Institute's Standard 810-2003, ``Performance Rating of Automatic 
Commercial Ice-Makers,'' section 4, ``Test Requirements,'' and section 
5, ``Rating Requirements.'' (Incorporated by reference, see Sec. 
431.133) Do not use the formula in section 8.3 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 
29-1988 (RA 2005) for calculating the power consumption, but instead 
calculate the energy use rate (kWh/100 lbs Ice) by dividing the energy 
consumed during testing by the total mass of the ice produced during the 
time period over

<R05>
Sec. 431.197  Manufacturer's determination of efficiency for distribution transformers.

    When a manufacturer or other party (both of which this section 
refers to as a ``manufacturer'') determines the efficiency of a 
distribution transformer in order to comply with an obligation imposed 
on it by or pursuant to Part C of Title III of EPCA, 42 U.S.C. 6311-
6317, this section applies. This section does not apply to enforcement 
testing conducted pursuant to Sec. 431.198 of this part.

[[Page 438]]

    (a) Methods used to determine efficiency--(1) General requirements. 
A manufacturer must determine the efficiency of each basic model of 
distribution transformer either by testing, in accordance with Sec. 
431.193 of this part and paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, 
or by application of an alternative efficiency determination method 
(AEDM) that meets the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of 
this section; provided, however, that a manufacturer may use an AEDM to 
determine the efficiency of one or more of its untested basic models 
only if it determines the efficiency of at least five of its other basic 
models (selected in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section) 
through actual testing. For each basic model of distribution transformer 
that has a configuration of windings which allows for more than one 
nominal rated voltage, the manufacturer must determine the basic model's 
efficiency either at the voltage at which the highest losses occur or at 
each voltage at which the transformer is rated to operate.
    (2) Alternative efficiency determination method. A manufacturer may 
apply an AEDM to a basic model pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section only if:
    (i) The AEDM has been derived from a mathematical model that 
represents the electrical characteristics of that basic model;
    (ii) The AEDM is based on engineering and statistical analysis, 
computer simulation or modeling, or other analytic evaluation of 
performance data; and
    (iii) The manufacturer has substantiated the AEDM, in accordance 
with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, by applying it to, and testing, 
at least five other basic models of the same type, i.e., low-voltage 
dry-type distribution transformers, medium-voltage dry-type distribution 
transformers, or liquid-immersed distribution transformers.
    (3) Substantiation of an alternative efficiency determination 
method. Before using an AEDM, the manufacturer must substantiate the 
AEDM's accuracy and reliability as follows:
    (i) Apply the AEDM to at least five of the manufacturer's basic 
models that have been selected for testing in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, and calculate the power loss for each of these 
basic models;
    (ii) Test at least five units of each of these basic models in 
accordance with the applicable test procedure and paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section, and determine the power loss for each of these basic 
models;
    (iii) The predicted total power loss for each of these basic models, 
calculated by applying the AEDM pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this 
section, must be within plus or minus five percent of the mean total 
power loss determined from the testing of that basic model pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section; and
    (iv) Calculate for each of these basic models the percentage that 
its power loss calculated pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(i) is of its 
power loss determined from testing pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(ii), 
compute the average of these percentages, and that calculated average 
power loss, expressed as a percentage of the average power loss 
determined from testing, must be no less than 97 percent and no greater 
than 103 percent.
    (4) Subsequent verification of an AEDM. (i) Each manufacturer that 
has used an AEDM under this section shall have available for inspection 
by the Department of Energy records showing: The method or methods used; 
the mathematical model, the engineering or statistical analysis, 
computer simulation or modeling, and other analytic evaluation of 
performance data on which the AEDM is based; complete test data, product 
information, and related information that the manufacturer has generated 
or acquired pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section; and the 
calculations used to determine the efficiency and total power losses of 
each basic model to which the AEDM was applied.
    (ii) If requested by the Department, the manufacturer shall conduct 
simulations to predict the performance of particular basic models of 
distribution transformers specified by the Department, analyses of 
previous simulations conducted by the manufacturer, sample testing of 
basic models selected by the Department, or a combination of the 
foregoing.

[[Page 439]]

    (b) Additional testing requirements--(1) Selection of basic models 
for testing if an AEDM is to be applied. (i) A manufacturer must select 
basic models for testing in accordance with the following criteria:
    (A) Two of the basic models must be among the five basic models with 
the highest unit volumes of production by the manufacturer in the prior 
year, or during the prior 12-calendar-month period beginning in 2003,\1\ 
whichever is later;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ When identifying these five basic models, any basic model that 
does not comply with Federal energy conservation standards for 
distribution transformers that may be in effect shall be excluded from 
consideration.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (B) No two basic models should have the same combination of power 
and voltage ratings; and
    (C) At least one basic model should be single-phase and at least one 
should be three-phase.
    (ii) In any instance where it is impossible for a manufacturer to 
select basic models for testing in accordance with all of these 
criteria, the criteria shall be given priority in the order in which 
they are listed. Within the limits imposed by the criteria, basic models 
shall be selected randomly.
    (2) Selection of units for testing within a basic model. For each 
basic model a manufacturer selects for testing, it shall select and test 
units as follows:
    (i) If the manufacturer would produce five or fewer units of a basic 
model over a reasonable period of time (approximately 180 days), then it 
must test each unit. However, a manufacturer may not use a basic model 
with a sample size of fewer than five units to substantiate an AEDM 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (ii) If the manufacturer produces more than five units over such 
period of time, it must either test all such units or select a sample of 
at least five units at random and test them. Any such sample shall be 
comprised of production units of the basic model, or units that are 
representative of such production units.
    (3) Applying results of testing. In a test of compliance with a 
represented efficiency, the average efficiency of the sample, X, which 
is defined by
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.000


where X<INF>i</INF> is the measured efficiency of unit i and n is the 
number of units tested, must satisfy the condition:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.001


where RE is the represented efficiency.

    Effective Date Note: At 71 FR 24997, Apr. 27, 2006, Sec. 431.197 
was added, effective May 30, 2006, except for paragraph (a)(4)(i) which 
contains information collection requirements and will not become 
effective until approval has been given by the Office of Management and 
Budget.


<R05>
Sec. 431.198  Enforcement testing for distribution transformers.

    (a) Test notice. Upon receiving information in writing, concerning 
the energy performance of a particular distribution transformer sold by 
a particular manufacturer or private labeler, which indicates that the 
transformer may not be in compliance with the applicable energy 
efficiency standard, or upon undertaking to ascertain the accuracy of 
the efficiency rating on the nameplate or in marketing materials for a 
distribution transformer, disclosed pursuant to this part, the 
Department may conduct testing of that equipment under this subpart by 
means of a test notice addressed to the manufacturer in accordance with 
the following requirements:
    (1) The test notice procedure will only be followed after the 
Department has examined the underlying test data (or, where appropriate, 
data as to use of an AEDM) provided by the manufacturer and after the 
manufacturer has been offered the opportunity to meet with the 
Department to verify, as applicable, compliance with the applicable 
efficiency standard, or the accuracy of labeling information, or both. 
In addition, where compliance of a basic model was certified based on an 
AEDM, the Department shall have the discretion to pursue the provisions 
of Sec. 431.197(a)(4)(ii) prior to invoking the test notice procedure. 
The Department

[[Page 440]]

shall be permitted to observe any reverification procedures undertaken 
pursuant to this subpart, and to inspect the results of such 
reverification.
    (2) The Department will mail or deliver the test notice to the plant 
manager or other responsible official, as designated by the 
manufacturer.
    (3) The test notice will specify the basic model(s) to be selected 
for testing, the method of selecting the test sample, the date and time 
at which testing shall be initiated, the date by which testing is 
scheduled to be completed and the facility at which testing will be 
conducted. The test notice may also provide for situations in which a 
specified basic model is unavailable for testing, and may include 
alternative basic models. The specified basic model may be one either 
that the manufacturer has rated by actual testing or that it has rated 
by the use of an AEDM.
    (4) The Department may require in the test notice that the 
manufacturer shall ship at its expense a reasonable number of units of 
each basic model specified in such test notice to a testing laboratory 
designated by the Department. The number of units of each basic model 
specified in a test notice shall not exceed twenty (20).
    (5) Except as required or provided in paragraphs (a)(6) or (a)(7) of 
this section, initially the Department will test five units.
    (6) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, if fewer 
than five units of a basic model are available for testing when the 
manufacturer receives the test notice, then
    (i) DOE will test the available unit(s); or
    (ii) If one or more other units of the basic model are expected to 
become available within six months, DOE may instead, at its discretion, 
test either:
    (A) The available unit(s) and one or more of the other units that 
subsequently become available (up to a maximum of twenty); or
    (B) Up to twenty of the other units that subsequently become 
available.
    (7) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section, if 
testing of the available or subsequently available units of a basic 
model would be impractical, as for example where a basic model is very 
large, has unusual testing requirements, or has limited production, the 
Department may in its discretion decide to base the determination of 
compliance on the testing of fewer than the available number of units, 
if the manufacturer so requests and demonstrates that the criteria of 
this paragraph are met.
    (8) When testing units under paragraphs (a)(5), (a)(6), or (a)(7) of 
this section, DOE shall perform the following number of tests:
    (i) If DOE tests four or more units, it will test each unit once;
    (ii) If DOE tests two or three units, it will test each unit twice; 
or
    (iii) If DOE tests one unit, it will test that unit four times.
    (9) Within five working days of the time the units are selected, the 
manufacturer shall ship the specified test units of the basic model to 
the testing laboratory.
    (b) Testing laboratory. Whenever the Department conducts enforcement 
testing at a designated laboratory in accordance with a test notice 
under this section, the resulting test data shall constitute official 
test data for that basic model. Such test data will be used by the 
Department to make a determination of compliance or noncompliance.
    (c) Sampling. The determination that a manufacturer's basic model 
complies with its labeled efficiency, or the applicable energy 
efficiency standard, shall be based on the testing conducted in 
accordance with the statistical sampling procedures set forth in 
Appendix B of this subpart and the test procedures specified for 
distribution transformers.
    (d) Test unit selection. The Department shall select a batch, a 
batch sample, and test units from the batch sample in accordance with 
the following provisions of this paragraph and the conditions specified 
in the test notice.
    (1) The batch may be subdivided by the Department utilizing criteria 
specified in the test notice.
    (2) The Department will then randomly select a batch sample of up to 
20 units from one or more subdivided groups within the batch. The 
manufacturer shall keep on hand all units in the batch sample until such 
time as

[[Page 441]]

the basic model is determined to be in compliance or non-compliance.
    (3) The Department will randomly select individual test units 
comprising the test sample from the batch sample.
    (4) All random selection shall be achieved by sequentially numbering 
all of the units in a batch sample and then using a table of random 
numbers to select the units to be tested.
    (e) Test unit preparation. (1) Prior to and during the testing, a 
test unit selected in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section 
shall not be prepared, modified, or adjusted in any manner unless such 
preparation, modification, or adjustment is allowed by the applicable 
Department of Energy test procedure.
    (2) No quality control, testing, or assembly procedures shall be 
performed on a test unit, or any parts and sub-assemblies thereof, that 
is not performed during the production and assembly of all other units 
included in the basic model.
    (3) A test unit shall be considered defective if such unit is 
inoperative or is found to be in noncompliance due to failure of the 
unit to operate according to the manufacturer's design and operating 
instructions. Defective units, including those damaged due to shipping 
or handling, shall be reported immediately to the Department. The 
Department shall authorize testing of an additional unit on a case-by-
case basis.
    (f) Testing at manufacturer's option. (1) If a manufacturer's basic 
model is determined to be in noncompliance with the applicable energy 
performance standard at the conclusion of Department testing in 
accordance with the sampling plan specified in Appendix B of this 
subpart, the manufacturer may request that the Department conduct 
additional testing of the basic model according to procedures set forth 
in Appendix B of this subpart and the test procedures specified for 
distribution transformers.
    (2) All units tested under this paragraph (f) shall be selected and 
tested in accordance with the provisions given in paragraphs (a)(9), 
(b), (d) and (e) of this section.
    (3) The manufacturer shall bear the cost of all testing conducted 
under this paragraph (f).
    (4) The manufacturer shall cease distribution of the basic model 
tested under the provisions of this paragraph from the time the 
manufacturer elects to exercise the option provided in this paragraph 
until the basic model is determined to be in compliance. The Department 
may seek civil penalties for all units distributed during such period.
    (5) If the additional testing results in a determination of 
compliance, a notice of allowance to resume distribution shall be issued 
by the Department.

                       3.0 Resistance Measurements

    3.1 General Considerations
    (a) Measure or establish the winding temperature at the time of the 
winding resistance measurement.
    (b) Measure the direct current resistance (R<INF>dc</INF>) of 
transformer windings by one of the methods outlined in section 3.3. The 
methods of section 3.5 must be used to correct load losses to the 
applicable reference temperature from the temperature at which they are 
measured. Observe precautions while taking measurements, such as those 
in section 3.4, in order to maintain measurement uncertainty limits 
specified in Table 2.1.
    3.2 Temperature Determination of Windings and Pre-conditions for 
Resistance Measurement.

[[Page 442]]

    Make temperature measurements in protected areas where the air 
temperature is stable and there are no drafts. Determine the winding 
temperature (T<INF>dc</INF>) for liquid-immersed and dry-type 
distribution transformers by the methods described in sections 3.2.1 and 
3.2.2, respectively.
    3.2.1 Liquid-Immersed Distribution Transformers.

                             3.2.1.1 Methods

    Record the winding temperature (T<INF>dc</INF>) of liquid-immersed 
transformers as the average of either of the following:
    (a) The measurements from two temperature sensing devices (for 
example, thermocouples) applied to the outside of the transformer tank 
and thermally insulated from the surrounding environment, with one 
located at the level of the oil and the other located near the tank 
bottom or at the lower radiator header if applicable; or
    (b) The measurements from two temperature sensing devices immersed 
in the transformer liquid, with one located directly above the winding 
and other located directly below the winding.

                           3.2.1.2 Conditions

    Make this determination under either of the following conditions:
    (a) The windings have been under insulating liquid with no 
excitation and no current in the windings for four hours before the dc 
resistance is measured; or
    (b) The temperature of the insulating liquid has stabilized, and the 
difference between the top and bottom temperature does not exceed 5 
[deg]C.
    3.2.2 Dry-Type Distribution Transformers.
    Record the winding temperature (T<INF>dc</INF>) of dry-type 
transformers as either of the following:
    (a) For ventilated dry-type units, use the average of readings of 
four or more thermometers, thermocouples, or other suitable temperature 
sensors inserted within the coils. Place the sensing points of the 
measuring devices as close as possible to the winding conductors. For 
sealed units, such as epoxy-coated or epoxy-encapsulated units, use the 
average of four or more temperature sensors located on the enclosure 
and/or cover, as close to different parts of the winding assemblies as 
possible; or
    (b) For both ventilated and sealed units, use the ambient 
temperature of the test area, under the following conditions:
    (1) All internal temperatures measured by the internal temperature 
sensors must not differ from the test area ambient temperature by more 
than 2 [deg]C.
    (2) Enclosure surface temperatures for sealed units must not differ 
from the test area ambient temperature by more than 2 [deg]C.
    (3) Test area ambient temperature should not have changed by more 
than 3 [deg]C for 3 hours before the test.
    (4) Neither voltage nor current has been applied to the unit under 
test for 24 hours. In addition, increase this initial 24 hour period by 
any added amount of time necessary for the temperature of the 
transformer windings to stabilize at the level of the ambient 
temperature. However, this additional amount of time need not exceed 24 
hours.
    3.3 Resistance Measurement Methods.
    Make resistance measurements using either the resistance bridge 
method, the voltmeter-ammeter method or a resistance meter. In each 
instance when this Uniform Test Method is used to test more than one 
unit of a basic model to determine the efficiency of that basic model, 
the resistance of the units being tested may be determined from making 
resistance measurements on only one of the units.
    3.3.1 Resistance Bridge Methods.
    If the resistance bridge method is selected, use either the 
Wheatstone or Kelvin bridge circuit (or the equivalent of either).

                        3.3.1.1 Wheatstone Bridge

    (a) This bridge is best suited for measuring resistances larger than 
ten ohms. A schematic diagram of a Wheatstone bridge with a 
representative transformer under test is shown in Figure 3.1.

[[Page 443]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.002

Where:

R<INF>dc</INF> is the resistance of the transformer winding being 
measured,
R<INF>s</INF> is a standard resistor having the resistance 
R<INF>s</INF>,
R<INF>a</INF>, R<INF>b</INF> are two precision resistors with resistance 
values R<INF>a</INF> and R<INF>b</INF> , respectively; at least one 
resistor must have a provision for resistance adjustment,
R<INF>t</INF> is a resistor for reducing the time constant of the 
circuit,
D is a null detector, which may be either a micro ammeter or 
microvoltmeter or equivalent instrument for observing that no signal is 
present when the bridge is balanced, and
V<INF>dc</INF> is a source of dc voltage for supplying the power to the 
Wheatstone Bridge.

    (b) In the measurement process, turn on the source (V<INF>dc</INF>), 
and adjust the resistance ratio (R<INF>a</INF>/R<INF>b</INF>) to produce 
zero signal at the detector (D). Determine the winding resistance by 
using equation 3-1 as follows:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.003

                          3.3.1.2 Kelvin Bridge

    (a) This bridge separates the resistance of the connecting 
conductors to the transformer winding being measured from the resistance 
of the winding, and therefore is best suited for measuring resistances 
of ten ohms and smaller. A schematic diagram of a Kelvin bridge with a 
representative transformer under test is shown in Figure 3.2.


[[Page 444]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.004

    (b) The Kelvin Bridge has seven of the same type of components as in 
the Wheatstone Bridge. It has two more resistors than the Wheatstone 
bridge, R<INF>a1</INF> and R<INF>b1</INF>. At least one of these 
resistors must have adjustable resistance. In the measurement process, 
the source is turned on, two resistance ratios (R<INF>a</INF>/
R<INF>b</INF>) and (R<INF>a1</INF>/R<INF>b1</INF>) are adjusted to be 
equal, and then the two ratios are adjusted together to balance the 
bridge producing zero signal at the detector. Determine the winding 
resistance by using equation 3-2 as follows:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.005

as with the Wheatstone bridge, with an additional condition that:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.006

    (c) The Kelvin bridge provides two sets of leads, current-carrying 
and voltage-sensing, to the transformer terminals and the standard 
resistor, thus eliminating voltage drops from the measurement in the 
current-carrying leads as represented by R<INF>d</INF>.
    3.3.2 Voltmeter-Ammeter Method.
    (a) Employ the voltmeter-ammeter method only if the rated current of 
the winding is greater than one ampere and the test current is limited 
to 15 percent of the winding current. Connect the transformer winding 
under test to the circuit shown in Figure 3.3.

[[Page 445]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.007

Where:

A is an ammeter or a voltmeter-shunt combination for measuring the 
current (I<INF>mdc</INF>) in the transformer winding,
V is a voltmeter with sensitivity in the millivolt range for measuring 
the voltage (V<INF>mdc</INF>) applied to the transformer winding,
R<INF>dc</INF> is the resistance of the transformer winding being 
measured,
R<INF>t</INF> is a resistor for reducing the time constant of the 
circuit, and
V<INF>dc</INF> is a source of dc voltage for supplying power to the 
measuring circuit.

    (b) To perform the measurement, turn on the source to produce 
current no larger than 15 percent of the rated current for the winding. 
Wait until the current and voltage readings have stabilized and then 
take simultaneous readings of voltage and current. Determine the winding 
resistance R<INF>dc</INF> by using equation 3-4 as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.008

Where:

V<INF>mdc</INF> is the voltage measured by the voltmeter V, and
I<INF>mdc</INF> is the current measured by the ammeter A.

    (c) As shown in Figure 3.3, separate current and voltage leads must 
be brought to the transformer terminals. (This eliminates the errors due 
to lead and contact resistance.)
    3.3.3 Resistance Meters.
    Resistance meters may be based on voltmeter-ammeter, or resistance 
bridge, or some other operating principle. Any meter used to measure a 
transformer's winding resistance must have specifications for resistance 
range, current range, and ability to measure highly inductive resistors 
that cover the characteristics of the transformer being tested. Also the 
meter's specifications for accuracy must meet the applicable criteria of 
Table 2.1 in section 2.0.
    3.4 Precautions in Measuring Winding Resistance.
    3.4.1 Required actions.
    The following guidelines must be observed when making resistance 
measurements:
    (a) Use separate current and voltage leads when measuring small (< 
10 ohms) resistance.
    (b) Use null detectors in bridge circuits, and measuring instruments 
in voltmeter-ammeter circuits, that have sensitivity and resolution 
sufficient to enable observation of at least 0.1 percent change in the 
measured resistance.
    (c) Maintain the dc test current at or below 15 percent of the rated 
winding current.
    (d) Inclusion of a stabilizing resistor R<INF>t</INF> (see section 
3.4.2) will require higher source voltage.
    (e) Disconnect the null detector (if a bridge circuit is used) and 
voltmeter from the circuit before the current is switched off, and 
switch off current by a suitable insulated switch.
    3.4.2 Guideline for Time Constant.
    (a) The following guideline is suggested for the tester as a means 
to facilitate the measurement of resistance in accordance with the 
accuracy requirements of section 2.0:
    (b) The accurate reading of resistance R<INF>dc</INF> may be 
facilitated by shortening the time constant. This is done by introducing 
a resistor R<INF>t</INF> in series with the winding under test in both 
the bridge and voltmeter-ammeter circuits as shown in Figures 3.1 to 
3.3. The relationship for the time constant is:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.009


[[Page 446]]


Where:

T<INF>c</INF> is the time constant in seconds,
L<INF>tc</INF> is the total magnetizing and leakage inductance of the 
winding under test, in henries, and
R<INF>tc</INF> is the total resistance in ohms, consisting of 
R<INF>t</INF> in series with the winding resistance R<INF>dc</INF> and 
the resistance R<INF>s</INF> of the standard resistor in the bridge 
circuit.

    (c) Because R<INF>tc</INF> is in the denominator of the expression 
for the time constant, increasing the resistance R<INF>tc</INF> will 
decrease the time constant. If the time constant in a given test circuit 
is too long for the resistance readings to be stable, then a higher 
resistance can be substituted for the existing R<INF>tc</INF>, and 
successive replacements can be made until adequate stability is reached.
    3.5 Conversion of Resistance Measurements.
    (a) Resistance measurements must be corrected, from the temperature 
at which the winding resistance measurements were made, to the reference 
temperature. As specified in these test procedures, the reference 
temperature for liquid-immersed transformers loaded at 50 percent of the 
rated load is 55 [deg]C. For medium-voltage, dry-type transformers 
loaded at 50 percent of the rated load, and for low-voltage, dry-type 
transformers loaded at 35 percent of the rated load, the reference 
temperature is 75 [deg]C.
    (b) Correct the measured resistance to the resistance at the 
reference temperature using equation 3-6 as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.010

Where:

R<INF>ts</INF> is the resistance at the reference temperature, 
T<INF>s</INF>,
R<INF>dc</INF> is the measured resistance at temperature, 
T<INF>dc</INF>,
T<INF>s</INF> is the reference temperature in [deg]C,
T<INF>dc</INF> is the temperature at which resistance was measured in 
[deg]C, and
T<INF>k</INF> is 234.5 [deg]C for copper or 225 [deg]C for aluminum.

                          4.0 Loss Measurement

    4.1 General Considerations.
    The efficiency of a transformer is computed from the total 
transformer losses, which are determined from the measured value of the 
no-load loss and load loss power components. Each of these two power 
loss components is measured separately using test sets that are 
identical, except that shorting straps are added for the load-loss test. 
The measured quantities will need correction for instrumentation losses 
and may need corrections for known phase angle errors in measuring 
equipment and for the waveform distortion in the test voltage. Any power 
loss not measured at the applicable reference temperature must be 
adjusted to that reference temperature. The measured load loss must also 
be adjusted to a specified output loading level if not measured at the 
specified output loading level. Test distribution transformers designed 
for harmonic currents using a sinusoidal waveform (k=1).
    4.2 Measurement of Power Losses.
    4.2.1 No-Load Loss.
    Measure the no-load loss and apply corrections as described in 
section 4.4, using the appropriate test set as described in section 4.3.
    4.2.2 Load Loss.
    Measure the load loss and apply corrections as described in section 
4.5, using the appropriate test set as described in section 4.3.
    4.3 Test Sets.
    (a) The same test set may be used for both the no-load loss and load 
loss measurements provided the range of the test set encompasses the 
test requirements of both tests. Calibrate the test set to national 
standards to meet the tolerances in Table 2.1 in section 2.0. In 
addition, the wattmeter, current measuring system and voltage measuring 
system must be calibrated separately if the overall test set calibration 
is outside the tolerance as specified in section 2.0 or the individual 
phase angle error exceeds the values specified in section 4.5.3.
    (b) A test set based on the wattmeter-voltmeter-ammeter principle 
may be used to measure the power loss and the applied voltage and 
current of a transformer where the transformer's test current and 
voltage are within the measurement capability of the measuring 
instruments. Current and voltage transformers, known collectively as 
instrument transformers, or other scaling devices such as resistive or 
capacitive dividers for voltage, may be used in the above circumstance, 
and must be used together with instruments to measure current, voltage, 
or power where the current or voltage of the transformer under test 
exceeds the measurement capability of such instruments. Thus, a test set 
may include a combination of measuring instruments and instrument 
transformers (or other scaling devices), so long as the current or 
voltage of the transformer under test does not exceed the measurement 
capability of any of the instruments.
    4.3.1 Single-Phase Test Sets.
    Use these for testing single-phase distribution transformers.
    4.3.1.1 Without Instrument Transformers.
    (a) A single-phase test set without an instrument transformer is 
shown in Figure 4.1.

[[Page 447]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.011

Where:

W is a wattmeter used to measure P<INF>nm</INF> and P<INF>lm</INF>, the 
no-load and load loss power, respectively,
V<INF>rms</INF> is a true root-mean-square (rms) voltmeter used to 
measure V<INF>r(nm)</INF> and V<INF>lm</INF>, the rms test voltages in 
no-load and load loss measurements, respectively,
V<INF>av</INF> is an average sensing voltmeter, calibrated to indicate 
rms voltage for sinusoidal waveforms and used to measure 
V<INF>a(nm)</INF>, the average voltage in no-load loss measurements,
A is an rms ammeter used to measure test current, especially 
I<INF>lm</INF>, the load loss current, and
(SC) is a conductor for providing a short-circuit across the output 
windings for the load loss measurements.

    (b) Either the primary or the secondary winding can be connected to 
the test set. However, more compatible voltage and current levels for 
the measuring instruments are available if for no-load loss measurements 
the secondary (low voltage) winding is connected to the test set, and 
for load loss measurements the primary winding is connected to the test 
set. Use the average-sensing voltmeter, V<INF>av</INF>, only in no-load 
loss measurements.
    4.3.1.2 With Instrument Transformers.
    A single-phase test set with instrument transformers is shown in 
Figure 4.2. This circuit has the same four measuring instruments as that 
in Figure 4.1. The current and voltage transformers, designated as (CT) 
and (VT), respectively, are added.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.012

    4.3.2 Three-Phase Test Sets.
    Use these for testing three-phase distribution transformers. Use in 
a four-wire, three-wattmeter test circuit.
    4.3.2.1 Without Instrument Transformers.
    (a) A three-phase test set without instrument transformers is shown 
in Figure 4.3. This test set is essentially the same circuit

[[Page 448]]

shown in Figure 4.1 repeated three times, and the instruments are 
individual devices as shown. As an alternative, the entire 
instrumentation system of a three-phase test set without transformers 
may consist of a multi-function analyzer.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.013

    (b) Either group of windings, the primary or the secondary, can be 
connected in wye or delta configuration. If both groups of windings are 
connected in the wye configuration for the no-load test, the neutral of 
the winding connected to the test set must be connected to the neutral 
of the source to provide a return path for the neutral current.
    (c) In the no-load loss measurement, the voltage on the winding must 
be measured. Therefore a provision must be made to switch the voltmeters 
for line-to-neutral measurements for wye-connected windings and for 
line-to-line measurements for delta-connected windings.
    4.3.2.2 With Instrument Transformers.
    A three-phase test set with instrument transformers is shown in 
Figure 4.4. This test set is essentially the same circuit shown in 
Figure 4.2 repeated three times. Provision must be made to switch the 
voltmeters for line-to-neutral and line-to-line measurements as in 
section 4.3.2.1. The voltage sensors (``coils'') of the wattmeters must 
always be connected in the line-to-neutral configuration.

[[Page 449]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.014

    4.3.2.3 Test Set Neutrals.
    If the power source in the test circuit is wye-connected, ground the 
neutral. If the power source in the test circuit is delta-connected, use 
a grounding transformer to obtain neutral and ground for the test.
    4.4 No-Load Losses: Measurement and Calculations.
    4.4.1 General Considerations.
    Measurement corrections are permitted but not required for 
instrumentation losses and for losses from auxiliary devices. 
Measurement corrections are required:
    (a) When the waveform of the applied voltage is non-sinusoidal; and
    (b) When the core temperature or liquid temperature is outside the 
20 [deg]C <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq> 10 [deg]C range.
    4.4.2 No-Load Loss Test.
    (a) The purpose of the no-load loss test is to measure no-load 
losses at a specified excitation voltage and a specified frequency. The 
no-load loss determination must be based on a sine-wave voltage 
corrected to the reference temperature. Connect either of the 
transformer windings, primary or secondary, to the appropriate test set 
of Figures 4.1 to 4.4, giving consideration to section 4.4.2(a)(2). 
Leave the unconnected winding(s) open circuited. Apply the rated voltage 
at rated frequency, as measured by the average-sensing voltmeter, to the 
transformer. Take the readings of the wattmeter(s) and the average-
sensing and true rms voltmeters. Observe the following precautions:
    (1) Voltmeter connections. When correcting to a sine-wave basis 
using the average-voltmeter method, the voltmeter connections must be 
such that the waveform applied to the voltmeters is the same as the 
waveform across the energized windings.
    (2) Energized windings. Energize either the high voltage or the low 
voltage winding of the transformer under test.
    (3) Voltage and frequency. The no-load loss test must be conducted 
with rated voltage impressed across the transformer terminals using a 
voltage source at a frequency equal to the rated frequency of the 
transformer under test.
    (b) Adjust the voltage to the specified value as indicated by the 
average-sensing voltmeter. Record the values of rms voltage, rms 
current, electrical power, and average voltage as close to 
simultaneously as possible. For a three-phase transformer, take all of 
the readings on one phase before proceeding to the next, and record the 
average of the three rms voltmeter readings as the rms voltage value.
    Note: When the tester uses a power supply that is not synchronized 
with an electric

[[Page 450]]

utility grid, such as a dc/ac motor-generator set, check the frequency 
and maintain it within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 percent of the rated 
frequency of the transformer under test. A power source that is directly 
connected to, or synchronized with, an electric utility grid need not be 
monitored for frequency.
    4.4.3 Corrections.
    4.4.3.1 Correction for Instrumentation Losses.
    Measured losses attributable to the voltmeters and wattmeter voltage 
circuit, and to voltage transformers if they are used, may be deducted 
from the total no-load losses measured during testing.
    4.4.3.2 Correction for Non-Sinusoidal Applied Voltage.
    (a) The measured value of no-load loss must be corrected to a 
sinusoidal voltage, except when waveform distortion in the test voltage 
causes the magnitude of the correction to be less than 1 percent. In 
such a case, no correction is required.
    (b) To make a correction where the distortion requires a correction 
of 5 percent or less, use equation 4-1. If the distortion requires a 
correction to be greater than 5 percent, improve the test voltage and 
re-test. Repeat until the distortion requires a correction of 5 percent 
or less.
    (c) Determine the no-load losses of the transformer corrected for 
sine-wave basis from the measured value by using equation 4-1 as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.015

Where:

P<INF>ncl</INF> is the no-load loss corrected to a sine-wave basis at 
the temperature (T<INF>nm</INF>) at which no-load loss is measured,
P<INF>nm</INF> is the measured no-load loss at temperature 
T<INF>nm</INF>,
P<INF>1</INF> is the per unit hysteresis loss,
P<INF>2</INF> is the per unit eddy-current loss,
P<INF>1</INF> + P<INF>2</INF> = 1,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.016

V<INF>r(nm)</INF> is the test voltage measured by rms voltmeter, and
V<INF>a(nm)</INF> is the test voltage measured by average-voltage 
voltmeter.
    (d) The two loss components (P<INF>1</INF> and P<INF>2</INF>) are 
assumed equal in value, each assigned a value of 0.5 per unit, unless 
the actual measurement-based values of hysteresis and eddy-current 
losses are available (in per unit form), in which case the actual 
measurements apply.
    4.4.3.3 Correction of No-Load Loss to Reference Temperature.
    After correcting the measured no-load loss for waveform distortion, 
correct the loss to the reference temperature of 20 [deg]C. If the no-
load loss measurements were made between 10 [deg]C and 30 [deg]C, this 
correction is not required. If the correction to reference temperature 
is applied, then the core temperature of the transformer during no-load 
loss measurement (T<INF>nm</INF>) must be determined within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq> 10 [deg]C of the true average core temperature. Correct 
the no-load loss to the reference temperature by using equation 4-2 as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.017

Where:

P<INF>nc</INF> is the no-load losses corrected for waveform distortion 
and then to the reference temperature of 20 [deg]C,
P<INF>nc1</INF> is the no-load losses, corrected for waveform 
distortion, at temperature T<INF>nm</INF>,
T<INF>nm</INF> is the core temperature during the measurement of no-load 
losses, and
T<INF>nr</INF> is the reference temperature, 20 [deg]C.

    4.5 Load Losses: Measurement and Calculations.
    4.5.1 General Considerations.
    (a) The load losses of a transformer are those losses incident to a 
specified load carried by the transformer. Load losses consist of ohmic 
loss in the windings due to the load current and stray losses due to the 
eddy currents induced by the leakage flux in the windings, core clamps, 
magnetic shields, tank walls, and other conducting parts. The ohmic loss 
of a transformer varies directly with temperature, whereas the stray 
losses vary inversely with temperature.
    (b) For a transformer with a tap changer, conduct the test at the 
rated current and rated-voltage tap position. For a transformer that has 
a configuration of windings which allows for more than one nominal rated 
voltage, determine its load losses either in the winding configuration 
in which the highest losses occur or in each winding configuration in 
which the transformer can operate.
    4.5.2 Tests for Measuring Load Losses.
    (a) Connect the transformer with either the high-voltage or low-
voltage windings to the appropriate test set. Then short-circuit the 
winding that was not connected to the test set. Apply a voltage at the 
rated frequency (of the transformer under test) to the connected 
windings to produce the rated current in the transformer. Take the 
readings of the wattmeter(s), the ammeters(s), and rms voltmeter(s).
    (b) Regardless of the test set selected, the following preparatory 
requirements must be satisfied for accurate test results:
    (1) Determine the temperature of the windings using the applicable 
method in section 3.2.1 or section 3.2.2.

[[Page 451]]

    (2) The conductors used to short-circuit the windings must have a 
cross-sectional area equal to, or greater than, the corresponding 
transformer leads, or, if the tester uses a different method to short-
circuit the windings, the losses in the short-circuiting conductor 
assembly must be less than 10 percent of the transformer's load losses.
    (3) When the tester uses a power supply that is not synchronized 
with an electric utility grid, such as a dc/ac motor-generator set, 
follow the provisions of the ``Note'' in section 4.4.2.
    4.5.3 Corrections.
    4.5.3.1 Correction for Losses from Instrumentation and Auxiliary 
Devices.
    4.5.3.1.1 Instrumentation Losses.
    Measured losses attributable to the voltmeters, wattmeter voltage 
circuit and short-circuiting conductor (SC), and to the voltage 
transformers if they are used, may be deducted from the total load 
losses measured during testing.
    4.5.3.1.2 Losses from Auxiliary Devices.
    Measured losses attributable to auxiliary devices (e.g., circuit 
breakers, fuses, switches) installed in the transformer, if any, that 
are not part of the winding and core assembly, may be excluded from load 
losses measured during testing. To exclude these losses, either (1) 
measure transformer losses without the auxiliary devices by removing or 
by-passing them, or (2) measure transformer losses with the auxiliary 
devices connected, determine the losses associated with the auxiliary 
devices, and deduct these losses from the load losses measured during 
testing.
    4.5.3.2 Correction for Phase Angle Errors.
    (a) Corrections for phase angle errors are not required if the 
instrumentation is calibrated over the entire range of power factors and 
phase angle errors. Otherwise, determine whether to correct for phase 
angle errors from the magnitude of the normalized per unit correction, 
[beta]<INF>n</INF>, obtained by using equation 4-3 as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.018

    (b) The correction must be applied if [beta]<INF>n</INF> is outside 
the limits of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.01. If [beta]<INF>n</INF> is 
within the limits of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.01, the correction is 
permitted but not required.
    (c) If the correction for phase angle errors is to be applied, first 
examine the total system phase angle ([beta]<INF>w</INF> - 
[beta]<INF>v</INF> + [beta]<INF>c</INF>). Where the total system phase 
angle is equal to or less than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>12 milliradians 
(<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>41 minutes), use either equation 4-4 or 4-5 to 
correct the measured load loss power for phase angle errors, and where 
the total system phase angle exceeds <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>12 
milliradians (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>41 minutes) use equation 4-5, as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.019

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.020

    (d) The symbols in this section (4.5.3.2) have the following 
meanings:

P<INF>lc1</INF> is the corrected wattmeter reading for phase angle 
errors,
P<INF>lm</INF> is the actual wattmeter reading,
V<INF>lm</INF> is the measured voltage at the transformer winding,
I<INF>lm</INF> is the measured rms current in the transformer winding,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.021

is the measured phase angle between V<INF>lm</INF> and I<INF>lm</INF>,

[beta]<INF>w</INF> is the phase angle error (in radians) of the 
wattmeter; the error is positive if the phase angle between the voltage 
and current phasors as sensed by the wattmeter is smaller than the true 
phase angle, thus effectively increasing the measured power,
[beta]<INF>v</INF> is the phase angle error (in radians) of the voltage 
transformer; the error is positive if the secondary voltage leads the 
primary voltage, and
[beta]<INF>c</INF> is the phase angle error (in radians) of the current 
transformer; the error is positive if the secondary current leads the 
primary current.

    (e) The instrumentation phase angle errors used in the correction 
equations must be specific for the test conditions involved.
    4.5.3.3 Temperature Correction of Load Loss.
    (a) When the measurement of load loss is made at a temperature 
T<INF>lm</INF> that is different from the reference temperature, use the 
procedure summarized in the equations 4-6 to 4-10 to correct the 
measured load loss to the reference temperature. The symbols used in 
these equations are defined at the end of this section.
    (b) Calculate the ohmic loss (P<INF>e</INF>) by using equation 4-6 
as follows:

[[Page 452]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.022

    (c) Obtain the stray loss by subtracting the calculated ohmic loss 
from the measured load loss, by using equation 4-7 as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.023

    (d) Correct the ohmic and stray losses to the reference temperature 
for the load loss by using equations 4-8 and 4-9, respectively, as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.024

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.025

    (e) Add the ohmic and stray losses, corrected to the reference 
temperature, to give the load loss, P<INF>lc2</INF>, at the reference 
temperature, by using equation 4-10 as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.026

    (f) The symbols in this section (4.5.3.3) have the following 
meanings:

I<INF>lm(p)</INF> is the primary current in amperes,
I<INF>lm(s)</INF> is the secondary current in amperes,

         5.0 Determining the Efficiency Value of the Transformer

    This section presents the equations to use in determining the 
efficiency value of the transformer at the required reference conditions 
and at the specified loading level. The details of measurements are 
described in sections 3.0 and 4.0. For a transformer that has a 
configuration of windings which allows for more than one nominal rated 
voltage, determine its efficiency either at the voltage at which the 
highest losses occur or at each voltage at which the transformer is 
rated to operate.
    5.1 Output Loading Level Adjustment.
    If the output loading level for energy efficiency is different from 
the level at which the load loss power measurements were made, then 
adjust the corrected load loss power, P<INF>lc2</INF>, by using equation 
5-1 as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16OC06.011

Where:

P<INF>lc</INF> is the adjusted load loss power to the specified energy 
efficiency load level,
P<INF>lc2</INF> is as calculated in section 4.5.3.3,
P<INF>or</INF> is the rated transformer apparent power (name plate),
P<INF>os</INF> is the specified energy efficiency load level, where 
P<INF>os</INF> = P<INF>or</INF>L, and
L is the per unit load level, e.g., if the load level is 50 percent then 
``L'' will be 0.5.
    5.2 Total Loss Power Calculation.

    Calculate the corrected total loss power by using equation 5-2 as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.029

Where:

P<INF>ts</INF> is the corrected total loss power adjusted for the 
transformer output loading specified by the standard,
P<INF>nc</INF> is as calculated in section 4.4.3.3, and
P<INF>lc</INF> is as calculated in section 5.1.

    5.3 Energy Efficiency Calculation.
    Calculate efficiency ([eta]) in percent at specified energy 
efficiency load level, P<INF>os</INF>, by using equation 5-3 as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.030

Where:

P<INF>os</INF> is as described and calculated in section 5.1, and
P<INF>ts</INF> is as described and calculated in section 5.2.
    5.4 Significant Figures in Power Loss and Efficiency Data.
    In measured and calculated data, retain enough significant figures 
to provide at least 1 percent resolution in power loss data and 0.01 
percent resolution in efficiency data.

            6.0 Test Equipment Calibration and Certification

    Maintain and calibrate test equipment and measuring instruments, 
maintain calibration records, and perform other test and measurement 
quality assurance procedures according to the following sections. The 
calibration of the test set must confirm the accuracy of the test set to 
that specified in section 2.0, Table 2.1.
    6.1 Test Equipment.

equipment, has the equipment on loan, or the equipment is provided by 
another party. Equipment shall be used in a manner which assures that 
measurement uncertainty is known and is consistent with the required 
measurement capability.
    6.2 Calibration and Certification.
    The party performing the tests must:
    (a) Identify the measurements to be made, the accuracy required 
(section 2.0) and select the appropriate measurement and test equipment;
    (b) At prescribed intervals, or prior to use, identify, check and 
calibrate, if needed, all measuring and test equipment systems or 
devices that affect test accuracy, against certified equipment having a 
known valid relationship to nationally recognized standards; where no 
such standards exist, the basis used for calibration must be documented;

    Effective Date Note: At 71 FR 24999, Apr. 27, 2006, appendix A to 
subpart K of part 431 was added, effective May 30, 2006, except for

been given by the Office of Management and Budget.


<R05>
Sec. Appendix B to Subpart K of Part 431--Sampling Plan for Enforcement 
                                 Testing

    Step 1. The number of units in the sample (m<INF>1</INF>) shall be 
in accordance with Sec. Sec. 431.198(a)(4), 431.198(a)(5), 
431.198(a)(6) and 431.198(a)(7) and shall not be greater than twenty. 
The number of tests in the first sample (n<INF>1</INF>) shall be in 
accordance with Sec. 431.198(a)(8) and shall be not fewer than four.
    Step 2. Compute the mean (X<INF>i</INF>) of the measured energy 
performance of the n<INF>1</INF> tests in the first sample by using 
equation 1 as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.031

where X<INF>i</INF> is the measured efficiency of test i.

    Step 3. Compute the sample standard deviation (S<INF>1</INF>) of the 
measured efficiency of the n<INF>1</INF> tests in the first sample by 
using equation 2 as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.032

    Step 4. Compute the standard error (SE(X<INF>1</INF>)) of the mean 
efficiency of the first sample by using equation 3 as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.033

    Step 5. Compute the sample size discount (SSD(m<INF>1</INF>)) by 
using equation 4 as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.034

where m<INF>1</INF> is the number of units in the sample, and RE is the 
applicable EPCA efficiency when the test is to determine compliance with 
the applicable statutory standard, or is the labeled efficiency when the 
test is to determine compliance with the labeled efficiency value.

    Step 6. Compute the lower control limit (LCL<INF>1</INF>) for the 
mean of the first sample by using equation 5 as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.035

where t is the 2.5th percentile of a t-distribution for a sample size of 
n<INF>1</INF>, which yields a

[[Page 455]]

97.5 percent confidence level for a one-tailed t-test.
    Step 7. Compare the mean of the first sample (X<INF>1</INF>) with 
the lower control limit (LCL<INF>1</INF>) to determine one of the 
following:
    (i) If the mean of the first sample is below the lower control 
limit, then the basic model is in non-compliance and testing is at an 
end.
    (ii) If the mean is equal to or greater than the lower control 
limit, no final determination of compliance or non-compliance can be 
made; proceed to Step 8.
    Step 8. Determine the recommended sample size (n) by using equation 
6 as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.036

 where S<INF>1</INF> and t have the values used in Steps 3 and 6, 
respectively. The factor
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.037

is based on an 8-percent tolerance in the total power loss.

    Given the value of n, determine one of the following:
    (i) If the value of n is less than or equal to n<INF>1</INF> and if 
the mean energy efficiency of the first sample (X<INF>1</INF>) is equal 
to or greater than the lower control limit (LCL<INF>1</INF>), the basic 
model is in compliance and testing is at an end.
    (ii) If the value of n is greater than n<INF>1</INF>, and no 
additional units are available for testing, testing is at an end and the 
basic model is in non-compliance. If the value of n is greater than 
n<INF>1</INF>, and additional units are available for testing, select a 
second sample n<INF>2</INF>. The size of the n<INF>2</INF> sample is 
determined to be the smallest integer equal to or greater than the 
difference n-n<INF>1</INF>. If the value of n<INF>2</INF> so calculated 
is greater than 20-n<INF>1</INF>, set n<INF>2</INF> equal to 20-
n<INF>1</INF>.
    Step 9. After testing the n<INF>2</INF> sample, compute the combined 
mean (X<INF>2</INF>) of the measured energy performance of the 
n<INF>1</INF> and n<INF>2</INF> tests of the combined first and second 
samples by using equation 7 as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.038

    Step 10. Compute the standard error (SE(X<INF>2</INF>)) of the mean 
efficiency of the n<INF>1</INF> and n<INF>2</INF> tests in the combined 
first and second samples by using equation 8 as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.039

(Note that S<INF>1</INF> is the value obtained above in Step 3.)

    Step 11. Set the lower control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>) to,
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.040
    
where t has the value obtained in Step 5 and SSD(m<INF>1</INF>) is 
sample size discount from Step 5. Compare the combined sample mean 
(X<INF>2</INF>) to the lower control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>) to find one 
of the following:

    (i) If the mean of the combined sample (X<INF>2</INF>) is less than 
the lower control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>), the basic model is in non-
compliance and testing is at an end.
    (ii) If the mean of the combined sample (X<INF>2</INF>) is equal to 
or greater than the lower control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>), the basic 
model is in compliance and testing is at an end.

                       Manufacturer-Option Testing

    If a determination of non-compliance is made in Steps 6, 7 or 11, 
above, the manufacturer may request that additional testing be 
conducted, in accordance with the following procedures.
    Step A. The manufacturer requests that an additional number, 
n<INF>3,</INF> of units be tested, with n<INF>3</INF> chosen such that 
n<INF>1</INF>+n<INF>2</INF>+n<INF>3</INF> does not exceed 20.
    Step B. Compute the mean efficiency, standard error, and lower 
control limit of the new combined sample in accordance with the 
procedures prescribed in Steps 8, 9, and 10, above.
    Step C. Compare the mean performance of the new combined sample to 
the lower control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>) to determine one of the 
following:
    (a) If the new combined sample mean is equal to or greater than the 
lower control limit, the basic model is in compliance and testing is at 
an end.
    (b) If the new combined sample mean is less than the lower control 
limit and the value of n<INF>1</INF>+n<INF>2</INF>+n<INF>3</INF> is less 
than 20, the manufacturer may request that additional units be tested. 
The total of all units tested may not exceed 20. Steps A, B, and C are 
then repeated.
    (c) Otherwise, the basic model is determined to be in non-
compliance.

test notice shall not exceed 20.
    (5) Within five working days of the time the units are selected, the 
manufacturer shall ship the specified test units of a basic model to the 
testing laboratory.
    (b) Testing laboratory. Whenever the Department conducts enforcement 
testing at a designated laboratory in accordance with a test notice 
under this section, the resulting test data shall constitute official 
test data for that basic model. Such test data will be used by the 
Department to make a determination of compliance or noncompliance if a 
sufficient number of tests have been conducted to satisfy the 
requirements of appendix A of this subpart.
    (c) Sampling. The determination that a manufacturer's basic model 
complies with its labeled efficiency, or the applicable energy 
efficiency standard, shall be based on the testing conducted in 
accordance with the statistical sampling procedures set forth in 
appendix A of this subpart and the test procedures set forth in appendix 
B to subpart B of this part.
    (d) Test unit selection. A Department inspector shall select a 
batch, a batch sample, and test units from the batch sample in 
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph and the conditions 
specified in the test notice.
    (1) The batch may be subdivided by the Department utilizing criteria 
specified in the test notice.
    (2) A batch sample of up to 20 units will then be randomly selected 
from one or more subdivided groups within the batch. The manufacturer 
shall keep on hand all units in the batch sample until such time as the 
basic model is determined to be in compliance or non-compliance.
    (3) Individual test units comprising the test sample shall be 
randomly selected from the batch sample.
    (4) All random selection shall be achieved by sequentially numbering 
all of the units in a batch sample and then using a table of random 
numbers to select the units to be tested.
    (e) Test unit preparation. (1) Prior to and during the testing, a 
test unit selected in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section 
shall not be prepared, modified, or adjusted in any manner unless such 
preparation, modification, or adjustment is allowed by the applicable 
Department of Energy test procedure. One test shall be conducted for 
each test unit in accordance with the applicable test procedures 
prescribed in appendix B to subpart B of this part.
    (2) No quality control, testing, or assembly procedures shall be 
performed on a test unit, or any parts and sub-assemblies thereof, that 
is not performed during the production and assembly of all other units 
included in the basic model.
    (3) A test unit shall be considered defective if such unit is 
inoperative or is found to be in noncompliance due to failure of the 
unit to operate according to the manufacturer's design and operating 
instructions. Defective units, including those damaged due to shipping 
or handling, shall be reported immediately to the Department. The 
Department shall authorize testing of an additional unit on a case-by-
case basis.
    (f) Testing at manufacturer's option. (1) If a manufacturer's basic 
model is determined to be in noncompliance with the applicable energy 
performance standard at the conclusion of Department testing in 
accordance with the sampling plan specified in appendix A of this 
subpart, the manufacturer may request that the Department conduct 
additional testing of the basic model according to procedures set forth 
in appendix A of this subpart.
    (2) All units tested under this paragraph shall be selected and 
tested in accordance with the provisions given in paragraphs (a) through 
(e) of this section.
    (3) The manufacturer shall bear the cost of all testing conducted 
under this paragraph.
    (4) The manufacturer shall cease distribution of the basic model 
tested under the provisions of this paragraph from the time the 
manufacturer elects to exercise the option provided in this paragraph 
until the basic model is determined to be in compliance. The Department 
may seek civil penalties for

[[Page 465]]

all units distributed during such period.
    (5) If the additional testing results in a determination of 
compliance, a notice of allowance to resume distribution shall be issued 
by the Department.

remedies, injunctive action to prohibit distribution in commerce of such 
basic model.


<R05>
Sec. 431.386  Remedies.

    If the Secretary determines that a basic model of any covered 
equipment does not comply with an applicable energy conservation 
standard:
    (a) The Secretary will notify the manufacturer, private labeler, or 
any other person as required, of this finding and of the Secretary's 
intent to seek a judicial order restraining further distribution in 
commerce of units of such a basic model unless the manufacturer, private 
labeler or other person as required, delivers, within 15 calendar days, 
a satisfactory statement to the Secretary, of the steps the 
manufacturer, private labeler or other person will take to insure that 
the noncompliant basic model will no longer be distributed in commerce. 
The Secretary will monitor the implementation of such statement.
    (b) If the manufacturer, private labeler or any other person as 
required, fails to stop distribution of the noncompliant basic model, 
the Secretary may seek to restrain such violation in accordance with 
sections 334 and 345 of the Act.
    (c) The Secretary will determine whether the facts of the case 
warrant the assessment of civil penalties for knowing violations in 
accordance with sections 333 and 345 of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 431.387  Hearings and appeals.

    (a) Under sections 333(d) and 345 of the Act, before issuing an 
order assessing a civil penalty against any person, the Secretary must 
provide to such a person a notice of the proposed penalty. Such notice 
must inform the person that such person can choose (in writing within 30 
days after receipt of the notice) to have the procedures of paragraph 
(c) of this section (in lieu of those in paragraph (b) of this section) 
apply with respect to such assessment.
    (b)(1) Unless a person elects, within 30 calendar days after receipt 
of a notice under paragraph (a) of this section, to have paragraph (c) 
of this section apply with respect to the civil penalty under paragraph 
(a), the Secretary will assess the penalty, by order, after providing an 
opportunity for an agency hearing under 5 U.S.C. 554, before an 
administrative law judge appointed

[[Page 466]]

under 5 U.S.C. 3105, and making a determination of violation on the 
record. Such assessment order will include the administrative law 
judge's findings and the basis for such assessment.
    (2) Any person against whom the Secretary assesses a penalty under 
this paragraph may, within 60 calendar days after the date of the order 
assessing such penalty, initiate action in the United States Court of 
Appeals for the appropriate judicial circuit for judicial review of such 
order in accordance with 5 U.S.C. chapter 7. The court will have 
jurisdiction to enter a judgment affirming, modifying, or setting aside 
in whole or in part, the order of the Secretary, or the court may remand 
the proceeding to the Secretary for such further action as the court may 
direct.
    (c)(1) In the case of any civil penalty with respect to which the 
procedures of this paragraph have been elected, the Secretary will 
promptly assess such penalty, by order, after the date of the receipt of 
the notice under paragraph (a) of this section of the proposed penalty.
    (2) If the person has not paid the civil penalty within 60 calendar 
days after the assessment has been made under paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, the Secretary will institute an action in the appropriate 
District Court of the United States for an order affirming the 
assessment of the civil penalty. The court will have authority to review 
de novo the law and the facts involved and jurisdiction to enter a 
judgment enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting 
aside in whole or in part, such assessment.
    (3) Any election to have this paragraph apply can only be revoked 
with the consent of the Secretary.
    (d) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty 
after it has become a final and unappealable order under paragraph (b) 
of this section, or after the appropriate District Court has entered 
final judgment in favor of the Secretary under paragraph (c) of this 
section, the Secretary will institute an action to recover the amount of 
such penalty in any appropriate District Court of the United States. In 
such action, the validity and appropriateness of such final assessment 
order or judgment will not be subject to review.
    (e)(1) In accordance with the provisions of sections 333(d)(5)(A) 
and 345 of the Act and notwithstanding the provisions of title 28, 
United States Code, or Section 502(c) of the Department of Energy 
Organization Act, the General Counsel of the Department of Energy (or 
any attorney or attorneys within DOE designated by the Secretary) will 
represent the Secretary, and will supervise, conduct, and argue any 
civil litigation to which paragraph (c) of this section applies 
(including any related collection action under paragraph (d) of this 
section) in a court of the United States or in any other court, except 
the Supreme Court of the United States. However, the Secretary or the 
General Counsel will consult with the Attorney General concerning such 
litigation and the Attorney General will provide, on request, such 
assistance in the conduct of such litigation as may be appropriate.
    (2) In accordance with the provisions of sections 333(d)(5)(B) and 
345 of the Act, and subject to the provisions of Section 502(c) of the 
Department of Energy Organization Act, the Secretary will be represented 
by the Attorney General, or the Solicitor General, as appropriate, in 
actions under this section, except to the extent provided in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section.
    (3) In accordance with the provisions of Section 333(d)(5)(c) and 
345 of the Act, Section 402(d) of the Department of Energy Organization 
Act will not apply with respect to the function of the Secretary under 
this section.

Sec. Appendix A to Subpart U of Part 431--Sampling Plan for Enforcement 
                       Testing of Electric Motors

    Step 1. The first sample size (n<INF>1</INF>) must be five or more 
units.
    Step 2. Compute the mean (X<INF>1</INF> of the measured energy 
performance of the n<INF>1</INF> units in the first sample as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.005

where X<INF>i</INF> is the measured full-load efficiency of unit i.

[[Page 467]]

    Step 3. Compute the sample standard deviation (S<INF>1</INF>) of the 
measured full-load efficiency of the n<INF>1</INF> units in the first 
sample as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.006

    Step 4. Compute the standard error (SE(X<INF>1</INF>)) of the mean 
full-load efficiency of the first sample as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.007

    Step 5. Compute the lower control limit (LCL<INF>1</INF>) for the 
mean of the first sample using RE as the desired mean as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.008

where: RE is the applicable EPCA nominal full-load efficiency when the 
test is to determine compliance with the applicable statutory standard, 
or is the labeled nominal full-load efficiency when the test is to 
determine compliance with the labeled efficiency value, and t is the 
2.5th percentile of a t-distribution for a sample size of n<INF>1</INF>, 
which yields a 97.5 percent confidence level for a one-tailed t-test.
    Step 6. Compare the mean of the first sample (X<INF>1</INF>) with 
the lower control limit (LCL<INF>1</INF>) to determine one of the 
following:
    (i) If the mean of the first sample is below the lower control 
limit, then the basic model is in non-compliance and testing is at an 
end.
    (ii) If the mean is equal to or greater than the lower control 
limit, no final determination of compliance or non-compliance can be 
made; proceed to Step 7.
    Step 7. Determine the recommended sample size (n) as follows:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.009
    
where S<INF>1</INF>, RE and t have the values used in Steps 3 and 5, 
respectively. The factor
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.010

is based on a 20 percent tolerance in the total power loss at full-load 
and fixed output power.
    Given the value of n, determine one of the following:
    (i) If the value of n is less than or equal to n<INF>1</INF> and if 
the mean energy efficiency of the first sample (X<INF>1</INF>) is equal 
to or greater than the lower control limit (LCL<INF>1</INF>), the basic 
model is in compliance and testing is at an end.
    (ii) If the value of n is greater than n1, the basic model is in 
non-compliance. The size of a second sample n<INF>2</INF> is determined 
to be the smallest integer equal to or greater than the difference n-
n<INF>1</INF>. If the value of n<INF>2</INF> so calculated is greater 
than 20-n1, set n<INF>2</INF> equal to 20-n<INF>1</INF>.
    Step 8. Compute the combined (X<INF>2</INF>) mean of the measured 
energy performance of the n<INF>1</INF> and n<INF>2</INF> units of the 
combined first and second samples as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.011

    Step 9. Compute the standard error (SE(X<INF>2</INF>)) of the mean 
full-load efficiency of the n<INF>1</INF> and n<INF>2</INF> units in the 
combined first and second samples as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.012

(Note that S<INF>1</INF> is the value obtained above in Step 3.)
    Step 10. Set the lower control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>) to,
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.013
    
where t has the value obtained in Step 5, and compare the combined 
sample mean (X<INF>2</INF>) to the lower control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>) 
to find one of the following:
    (i) If the mean of the combined sample (X<INF>2</INF>) is less than 
the lower control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>), the basic model is in non-
compliance and testing is at an end.
    (ii) If the mean of the combined sample (X<INF>2</INF>) is equal to 
or greater than the lower control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>), the basic 
model is in compliance and testing is at an end.

                       Manufacturer-Option Testing

    If a determination of non-compliance is made in Steps 6, 7 or 10, of 
this appendix A, the manufacturer may request that additional testing be 
conducted, in accordance with the following procedures.
    Step A. The manufacturer requests that an additional number, 
n<INF>3</INF>, of units be tested, with n<INF>3</INF> chosen such that 
n<INF>1</INF> + n<INF>2</INF> + n<INF>3</INF> does not exceed 20.
    Step B. Compute the mean full-load efficiency, standard error, and 
lower control limit of the new combined sample in accordance with the 
procedures prescribed in Steps 8, 9, and 10, of this appendix A.
    Step C. Compare the mean performance of the new combined sample to 
the lower control limit (LCL<INF>2</INF>) to determine one of the 
following:
    (a) If the new combined sample mean is equal to or greater than the 
lower control

[[Page 468]]

limit, the basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end.
    (b) If the new combined sample mean is less than the lower control 
limit and the value of n<INF>1</INF> + n<INF>2</INF> + n<INF>3</INF> is 
less than 20, the manufacturer may request that additional units be 
tested. The total of all units tested may not exceed 20. Steps A, B, and 
C are then repeated.
    (c) Otherwise, the basic model is determined to be in non-
compliance.

Sec. 431.401  Petitions for waiver, and applications for interim waiver, of test procedure.

    (a) General criteria. (1) Any interested person may submit a 
petition to waive for a particular basic model any requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 431.16, 431.76, 431.86, 431.96, and 431.106 of this part, 
upon the grounds that either the basic model contains one or more design 
characteristics which prevent testing of the basic model according to 
the prescribed test procedures, or the prescribed test procedures may 
evaluate the basic model in a manner so unrepresentative of its true 
energy consumption characteristics as to provide materially inaccurate 
comparative data.
    (2) Any person who has submitted a Petition for Waiver as provided 
in this subpart, may also file an Application for Interim Waiver of the 
applicable test procedure requirements.
    (b) Submission, content, and publication. (1) You must submit your 
Petition for Waiver in triplicate, to the Assistant Secretary for Energy 
Efficiency and Renewable Energy, U.S. Department of Energy. Each 
Petition for Waiver must:
    (i) Identify the particular basic model(s) for which a waiver is 
requested, the design characteristic(s) constituting the grounds for the 
petition, and the specific requirements sought to be waived, and must 
discuss in detail the need for the requested waiver;
    (ii) Identify manufacturers of all other basic models marketed in 
the United States and known to the petitioner to incorporate similar 
design characteristic(s);
    (iii) Include any alternate test procedures known to the petitioner 
to evaluate the characteristics of the basic model in a manner 
representative of its energy consumption; and
    (iv) Be signed by you or by an authorized representative. In 
accordance with the provisions set forth in 10 CFR 1004.11, any request 
for confidential treatment of any information contained in a Petition 
for Waiver or in supporting documentation must be accompanied by a copy 
of the petition, application or supporting documentation from which the 
information claimed to be confidential has been deleted. DOE will 
publish in the Federal Register the petition and supporting documents 
from which confidential information, as determined by DOE, has been 
deleted in accordance with 10 CFR 1004.11 and will solicit comments, 
data and information with respect to the determination of the petition.
    (2) You must submit any Application for Interim Waiver in 
triplicate, with the required three copies of the Petition for Waiver, 
to the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, 
U.S. Department of Energy. Each Application for Interim Waiver must 
reference the Petition for Waiver by identifying the particular basic 
model(s) for which you seek a waiver and temporary exception. Each 
Application for Interim Waiver must demonstrate likely success of the 
Petition for Waiver and address what economic hardship and/or 
competitive disadvantage is likely to result absent a favorable 
determination on the Application for Interim Waiver. You or an 
authorized representative must sign the Application for Interim Waiver.
    (c) Notification to other manufacturers. (1) After filing a Petition 
for Waiver with DOE, and after DOE has published the Petition for Waiver 
in the Federal Register, you must, within five working days of such 
publication, notify in writing all known manufacturers of domestically 
marketed units of the same product type (as defined in Section 340(1) of 
the Act) and must include in the notice a statement that DOE has 
published in the Federal Register on a certain date the Petition for 
Waiver

[[Page 469]]

and supporting documents from which confidential information, if any, as 
determined by DOE, has been deleted in accordance with 10 CFR 1004.11. 
In complying with the requirements of this paragraph, you must file with 
DOE a statement certifying the names and addresses of each person to 
whom you have sent a notice of the Petition for Waiver.
    (2) If you apply for Interim Waiver, whether filing jointly with or 
subsequent to your Petition for Waiver with DOE, you must concurrently 
notify in writing all known manufacturers of domestically marketed units 
of the same product type (as defined in Section 340(1) of the Act), and 
must include in the notice a copy of the Petition for Waiver and a copy 
of the Application for Interim Waiver. In complying with this section, 
you must in the written notification include a statement that the 
Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy will 
receive and consider timely written comments on the Application for 
Interim Waiver. Upon filing an Application for Interim Waiver, you must 
in complying with the requirements of this paragraph certify to DOE that 
a copy of these documents has been sent to all known manufacturers of 
domestically marked units of the same product type (as listed in Section 
340(1) of the Act). Such certification must include the names and 
addresses of such persons. You must comply with the provisions of 
paragraph (c)(1) of this Section with respect to the petition for 
waiver.
    (d) Comments; responses to comments. (1) Any person submitting 
written comments to DOE with respect to an Application for Interim 
Waiver must also send a copy of the comments to the applicant.
    (2) Any person submitting written comments to DOE with the respect 
to a Petition for Waiver must also send a copy of such comments to the 
petitioner. In accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a 
petitioner may submit a rebuttal statement to the Assistant Secretary 
for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.
    (e) Provisions specific to interim waivers--(1) Disposition of 
application. If administratively feasible, DOE will notify the applicant 
in writing of the disposition of the Application for Interim Waiver 
within 15 business days of receipt of the application. Notice of DOE's 
determination on the Application for Interim Waiver will be published in 
the Federal Register.
    (2) Consequences of filing application. The filing of an Application 
for Interim Waiver will not constitute grounds for noncompliance with 
any requirements of this subpart, until an Interim Waiver has been 
granted.
    (3) Criteria for granting. The Assistant Secretary for Energy 
Efficiency and Renewable Energy will grant an Interim Waiver from test 
procedure requirements if he or she determines that the applicant will 
experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver is 
denied, if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be 
granted, and/or if the Assistant Secretary determines that it would be 
desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a 
determination on the Petition for Waiver.
    (4) Duration. An interim waiver will terminate 180 days after 
issuance or upon the determination on the Petition for Waiver, whichever 
occurs first. DOE may extend an interim waiver for up to 180 days or 
modify its terms based on relevant information contained in the record 
and any comments received subsequent to issuance of the interim waiver. 
DOE will publish in the Federal Register notice of such extension and/or 
any modification of the terms or duration of the interim waiver.
    (f) Provisions specific to waivers--(1) Rebuttal by petitioner. 
Following publication of the Petition for Waiver in the Federal 
Register, a petitioner may, within 10 working days of receipt of a copy 
of any comments submitted in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, submit a rebuttal statement to the Assistant Secretary for 
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. A petitioner may rebut more than 
one response in a single rebuttal statement.
    (2) Disposition of petition. DOE will notify the petitioner in 
writing as soon as practicable of the disposition of each Petition for 
Waiver. The Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable 
Energy will issue a decision on the petition as soon as is practicable

[[Page 470]]

following receipt and review of the Petition for Waiver and other 
applicable documents, including, but not limited to, comments and 
rebuttal statements.
    (3) Consequence of filing petition. The filing of a Petition for 
Waiver will not constitute grounds for noncompliance with any 
requirements of this subpart, until a waiver or interim waiver has been 
granted.
    (4) Granting: criteria, conditions, and publication. The Assistant 
Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy will grant a waiver 
if he or she determines that either the basic model for which the waiver 
was requested contains a design characteristic which prevents testing of 
the basic model according to the prescribed test procedures, or the 
prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner so 
unrepresentative of its true energy consumption characteristics as to 
provide materially inaccurate comparative data. The Assistant Secretary 
for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy may grant a waiver subject to 
conditions, which may include adherence to alternate test procedures. 
DOE will promptly publish in the Federal Register notice of each waiver 
granted or denied, and any limiting conditions of each waiver granted.
    (g) Revision of regulation. Within one year of the granting of any 
waiver, the Department will publish in the Federal Register a notice of 
proposed rulemaking to amend our regulations so as to eliminate any need 
for the continuation of such waiver. As soon thereafter as practicable, 
the Department will publish in the Federal Register a final rule. Such 
waiver will terminate on the effective date of such final rule.
    (h) Exhaustion of remedies. In order to exhaust administrative 
remedies, any person aggrieved by an action under this Section must file 
an appeal with the DOE's Office of Hearings and Appeals as provided in 
10 CFR Part 1003, subpart C.

<R05>
Sec. 431.421  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The regulations in this subpart prescribe the procedures to be 
followed in connection with petitions requesting a rule that a State 
regulation prescribing an energy conservation standard or other 
requirement respecting energy use or energy efficiency of a type (or 
class) of covered equipment not be preempted.
    (b) The regulations in this subpart also prescribe the procedures to 
be followed in connection with petitions to withdraw a rule exempting a 
State regulation prescribing an energy conservation standard or other 
requirement respecting energy use or energy efficiency of a type (or 
class) of covered equipment.


<R05>
Sec. 431.422  Prescriptions of a rule.

    (a) Criteria for exemption from preemption. Upon petition by a State 
which has prescribed an energy conservation standard or other 
requirement for a type or class of covered equipment for which a Federal 
energy conservation standard is applicable, the Secretary shall 
prescribe a rule that such standard not be preempted if he/she 
determines that the State has established by a preponderance of evidence 
that such requirement is needed to meet unusual and compelling State or 
local energy interests. For the purposes of this regulation, the term 
``unusual and compelling State or local energy interests'' means 
interests which are substantially different in nature or magnitude from 
those prevailing in the U.S. generally, and are such that when evaluated 
within the context of the State's energy plan and forecast, the

[[Page 472]]

costs, benefits, burdens, and reliability of energy savings resulting 
from the State regulation make such regulation preferable or necessary 
when measured against the costs, benefits, burdens, and reliability of 
alternative approaches to energy savings or production, including 
reliance on reasonably predictable market-induced improvements in 
efficiency of all equipment subject to the State regulation. The 
Secretary may not prescribe such a rule if he finds that interested 
persons have established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the 
State's regulation will significantly burden manufacturing, marketing, 
distribution, sale or servicing of the covered equipment on a national 
basis. In determining whether to make such a finding, the Secretary 
shall evaluate all relevant factors including: The extent to which the 
State regulation will increase manufacturing or distribution costs of 
manufacturers, distributors, and others; the extent to which the State 
regulation will disadvantage smaller manufacturers, distributors, or 
dealers or lessen competition in the sale of the covered equipment in 
the State; the extent to which the State regulation would cause a burden 
to manufacturers to redesign and produce the covered equipment type (or 
class), taking into consideration the extent to which the regulation 
would result in a reduction in the current models, or in the projected 
availability of models, that could be shipped on the effective date of 
the regulation to the State and within the U.S., or in the current or 
projected sales volume of the covered equipment type (or class) in the 
State and the U.S.; and the extent to which the State regulation is 
likely to contribute significantly to a proliferation of State 
commercial and industrial equipment efficiency requirements and the 
cumulative impact such requirements would have. The Secretary may not 
prescribe such a rule if he/she finds that such a rule will result in 
the unavailability in the State of any covered equipment (or class) of 
performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, 
capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as those 
generally available in the State at the time of the Secretary's finding. 
The failure of some classes (or types) to meet this criterion shall not 
affect the Secretary's determination of whether to prescribe a rule for 
other classes (or types).
    (1) Requirements of petition for exemption from preemption. A 
petition from a State for a rule for exemption from preemption shall 
include the information listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through 
(a)(1)(vi) of this section. A petition for a rule and correspondence 
relating to such petition shall be available for public review except 
for confidential or proprietary information submitted in accordance with 
the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information Regulations set forth 
in 10 CFR Part 1004.
    (i) The name, address, and telephone number of the petitioner;
    (ii) A copy of the State standard for which a rule exempting such 
standard is sought;
    (iii) A copy of the State's energy plan and forecast;
    (iv) Specification of each type or class of covered equipment for 
which a rule exempting a standard is sought;
    (v) Other information, if any, believed to be pertinent by the 
petitioner; and
    (vi) Such other information as the Secretary may require.
    (b) Criteria for exemption from preemption when energy emergency 
conditions exist within State. Upon petition by a State which has 
prescribed an energy conservation standard or other requirement for a 
type or class of covered equipment for which a Federal energy 
conservation standard is applicable, the Secretary may prescribe a rule, 
effective upon publication in the Federal Register, that such regulation 
not be preempted if he determines that in addition to meeting the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this Section the State has established 
that: an energy emergency condition exists within the State that 
imperils the health, safety, and welfare of its residents because of the 
inability of the State or utilities within the State to provide adequate 
quantities of gas or electric energy to its residents at less than 
prohibitive costs; and cannot be substantially alleviated by the 
importation of energy or the use of interconnection

[[Page 473]]

agreements; and the State regulation is necessary to alleviate 
substantially such condition.
    (1) Requirements of petition for exemption from preemption when 
energy emergency conditions exist within a State. A petition from a 
State for a rule for exemption from preemption when energy emergency 
conditions exist within a State shall include the information listed in 
paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(vi) of this section. A petition 
shall also include the information prescribed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) 
through (b)(1)(iv) of this section, and shall be available for public 
review except for confidential or proprietary information submitted in 
accordance with the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information 
Regulations set forth in 10 CFR Part 1004:
    (i) A description of the energy emergency condition which exists 
within the State, including causes and impacts.
    (ii) A description of emergency response actions taken by the State 
and utilities within the State to alleviate the emergency condition;
    (iii) An analysis of why the emergency condition cannot be 
alleviated substantially by importation of energy or the use of 
interconnection agreements;
    (iv) An analysis of how the State standard can alleviate 
substantially such emergency condition.
    (c) Criteria for withdrawal of a rule exempting a State standard. 
Any person subject to a State standard which, by rule, has been exempted 
from Federal preemption and which prescribes an energy conservation 
standard or other requirement for a type or class of covered equipment, 
when the Federal energy conservation standard for such equipment 
subsequently is amended, may petition the Secretary requesting that the 
exemption rule be withdrawn. The Secretary shall consider such petition 
in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, 
except that the burden shall be on the petitioner to demonstrate that 
the exemption rule received by the State should be withdrawn as a result 
of the amendment to the Federal standard. The Secretary shall withdraw 
such rule if he determines that the petitioner has shown the rule should 
be withdrawn.
    (1) Requirements of petition to withdraw a rule exempting a State 
standard. A petition for a rule to withdraw a rule exempting a State 
standard shall include the information prescribed in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(vii) of this section, and shall be available 
for public review, except for confidential or proprietary information 
submitted in accordance with the Department of Energy's Freedom of 
Information Regulations set forth in 10 CFR Part 1004:
    (i) The name, address and telephone number of the petitioner;
    (ii) A statement of the interest of the petitioner for which a rule 
withdrawing an exemption is sought;
    (iii) A copy of the State standard for which a rule withdrawing an 
exemption is sought;
    (iv) Specification of each type or class of covered equipment for 
which a rule withdrawing an exemption is sought;
    (v) A discussion of the factors contained in paragraph (a) of this 
section;
    (vi) Such other information, if any, believed to be pertinent by the 
petitioner; and
    (vii) Such other information as the Secretary may require.
    (2) [Reserved]

<R05>
Sec. 434.99  Explanation of numbering system for codes.

    (a) For purposes of this part, a derivative of two different 
numbering systems will be used.
    (1) For the purpose of designating a section, the system employed in 
the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) will be employed. The number 
``434'' which signifies part 434 in chapter II of Title 10, Code of 
Federal Regulations, is used as a prefix for all section headings. The 
suffix is a two or three digit section number. For example the lighting 
section of the standards is designated Sec. 434.401.
    (2) Within each section, a numbering system common to many national 
voluntary consensus standards is used. A decimal system is used to 
denote paragraphs and subparagraphs within a section. For example, in 
Sec. 434.401, ``401.2.1'' refers to subsection 401, paragraph 2, 
subparagraph 1.
    (b) The hybrid numbering system is used for two purposes:
    (1) The use of the Code of Federal Regulations' numbering system 
allows the researcher using the CFR easy access to the standards.

Sec. 434.100  Purpose.

    The provisions of this part provide minimum standards for energy 
efficiency for the design of new Federal commercial and multi-family 
high rise residential buildings, for which design for construction began 
before January 3, 2007. The performance standards are designed to 
achieve the maximum practicable improvements in energy efficiency and 
increases in the use of non-depletable sources of energy. This rule is 
based upon the ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-1989 and addenda b, c, d, e, 
f, g, and i. (This document is available from the American Society of 
Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc., 1791 Tullie

power for the building, or a facility containing multiple buildings, 
shall not exceed the total exterior lighting power allowance, which is 
the sum of the individual allowances determined from Table 401.3.1. The 
individual allowances are determined by multiplying the specific area or 
length of each area description times the allowance for that area. 
Exceptions are as follows: Lighting for outdoor manufacturing or 
processing facilities, commercial greenhouses, outdoor athletic 
facilities, public monuments, designated high-risk security areas, 
signs, retail storefronts, exterior enclosed display windows, and 
lighting specifically required by local ordinances and regulations.

    401.3.1.1 Trade-offs of exterior lighting budgets among exterior 
areas shall be allowed provided the total connected lighting power of 
the exterior area does not exceed the exterior lighting power allowance. 
Trade-offs between interior lighting power allowances and exterior 
lighting power allowances shall not be allowed.
    401.3.2 Building interiors. The total connected interior lighting 
power for a building, including adjustments in accordance with 
subsection 401.3.3, shall not exceed the total interior lighting power 
allowance explained in this paragraph. Using Table 401.3.2a, multiply 
the interior lighting power allowance value by the gross lighted area of 
the most appropriate building or space activity. For multi-use 
buildings, using Table 401.3.2a, select the interior power allowance 
value for each activity using the column for the gross lighted area of 
the whole building and multiply it by the associated gross area for that 
activity. The interior lighting power allowance is the sum of all the 
wattages for each area/activity. Using Table 401.3.2b, c, or d, multiply 
the interior lighting power allowance values of each individual area/
activity by the area of the space and by the area factor from Figure 
401.3.2e, based on the most appropriate area/activity provided. The

[[Page 490]]

interior lighting power allowance is the sum of the wattages for each 
individual space. When over 20% of the building's tasks or interior 
areas are undefined, the most appropriate value for that building from 
Table 401.3.2a shall be used for the undefined spaces. Exceptions are as 
follows:
    (a) Lighting power that is an essential technical element for the 
function performed in theatrical, stage, broadcasting, and similar uses.
    (b) Specialized medical, dental, and research lighting.
    (c) Display lighting for exhibits in galleries, museums, and 
monuments.
    (d) Lighting solely for indoor plant growth (between the hours of 
10:00 pm and 6:00 am).
    (e) Emergency lighting that is automatically off during normal 
building operation.
    (f) High-risk security areas.
    (g) Spaces specifically designed for the primary use by the 
physically impaired or aged.
    (h) Lighting in dwelling units.
    401.3.2.1 Trade-offs of the interior lighting power budgets among 
interior spaces shall be allowed provided the total connected lighting 
power within the building does not exceed the interior lighting power 
allowance. Trade-offs between interior lighting power allowances and 
exterior lighting power allowances shall not be allowed.
    401.3.2.2 Building/Space Activities. Definitions of buildings/space 
activity as they apply to Table 401.3.2a are as follows. These 
definitions are necessary to characterize the activities for which 
lighting is provided. They are applicable only to Table 401.3.2a. They 
are not intended to be used elsewhere in place of building use group 
definitions provided in the Building Code. They are not included in 
Sec. 434.201, ``Definitions,'' to avoid confusion with ``Occupancy Type 
Categories.''
    (a) Food service, fast food, and cafeteria: This group includes 
cafeterias, hamburger and sandwich stores, bakeries, ice cream parlors, 
cookie stores, and all other kinds of retail food service establishments 
in which customers are generally served at a counter and their direct 
selections are paid for and taken to a table or carried out.
    (b) Garages: This category includes all types of parking garages, 
except for service or repair areas.
    (c) Leisure dining and bar: This group includes cafes, diners, bars, 
lounges, and similar establishments where orders are placed with a wait 
person.
    (d) Mall concourse, multi-store service: This group includes the 
interior of multifunctional public spaces, such as shopping center 
malls, airports, resort concourses and malls, entertainment facilities, 
and related types of buildings or spaces.
    (e) Offices: This group includes all kinds of offices, including 
corporate and professional offices, office/laboratories, governmental 
offices, libraries, and similar facilities, where paperwork occurs.
    (f) Retail: A retail store, including departments for the sale of 
accessories, clothing, dry goods, electronics, and toys, and other types 
of establishments that display objects for direct selection and purchase 
by consumers. Direct selection means literally removing an item from 
display and carrying it to the checkout or pick-up at a customer service 
facility.
    (g) Schools: This category, subdivided by pre-school/elementary, 
junior high/high school, and technical/vocational, includes public and 
private educational institutions, for children or adults, and may also 
include community centers, college and university buildings, and 
business educational centers.
    (h) Service establishment: A retail-like facility, such as watch 
repair, real estate offices, auto and tire service facilities, parts 
departments, travel agencies and similar facilities, in which the 
customer obtains services rather than the direct selection of goods.
    (i) Warehouse and storage: This includes all types of support 
facilities, such as warehouses, barns, storage buildings, shipping/
receiving buildings, boiler or mechanical buildings, electric power 
buildings, and similar buildings where the primary visual task is large 
items.

Area Factor (AF) = 0.2 + 0.8(1/0.9<SUP>n</SUP>)

Where:

AF = area factor,
CH = ceiling height (ft),
A<INF>r</INF> = space area (ft\2\).

If AF <1.0 use 1.0; if AF <ls-thn-eq>1.8 use 1.8

    401.3.3 Lighting Power Control Credits. The interior connected 
lighting power determined in accordance with Sec. 434.401.3.2 can be 
decreased for luminaries that are automatically controlled for 
occupancy, daylight, lumen maintenance, or programmable timing. The 
adjusted interior connected lighting power shall be determined by 
subtracting the sum of all lighting power control credits from the 
interior connected lighting power. Using Table 401.3.3, the lighting 
power control credit equals the power adjustment factor times the 
connected lighting power of the controlled lighting. The lighting power 
adjustment shall be applied with the following limitations:
    (a) It is limited to the specific area controlled by the automatic 
control device.
    (b) Only one lighting power adjustment may be used for each building 
space or luminaire, and 50 percent or more of the controlled luminaire 
shall be within the applicable space.
    (c) Controls shall be installed in series with the lights and in 
series with all manual switching devices.
    (d) When sufficient daylight is available, daylight sensing controls 
shall be capable of reducing electrical power consumption for lighting 
(continuously or in steps) to 50 percent or less of maximum power 
consumption.
    (e) Daylight sensing controls shall control all luminaires to which 
the adjustment is applied and that direct a minimum of 50 percent of 
their light output into the daylight zone.
    (f) Programmable timing controls shall be able to program different 
schedules for occupied and unoccupied days, be readily accessible for 
temporary override with automatic return to the original schedule, and 
keep time during power outages for at least four hours.

Sec. 434.402  Building envelope assemblies and materials.

    The building envelope and its associated assemblies and materials 
shall meet the provisions of this section.
    402.1 Calculations and Supporting Information.
    402.1.1 Material Properties. Information on thermal properties, 
building envelope system performance, and component heat transfer shall 
be obtained from RS-4. When the information is not available from RS-4, 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 434.701) the data shall be 
obtained from manufacturer's information or laboratory or field test 
measurements using RS-5, RS-6, RS-7, or RS-8 (incorporated by reference, 
see Sec. 434.701).
    402.1.1.1 The shading coefficient (SC) for fenestration shall be 
obtained from RS-4 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 434.701) or 
from manufacturer's test data. The shading coefficient of the 
fenestration, including both internal and external shading devices, is 
SC<INF>X</INF> and excludes the effect of external shading projections, 
which are calculated separately. The shading coefficient used for 
louvered shade screens shall be determined using a profile angle of 30 
degrees as found in Table 41, Chapter 27 of RS-4 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 434.701).
    402.1.2 Thermal Performance Calculations. The overall thermal 
transmittance of the building envelope shall be calculated in accordance 
with Equation 402.1.2:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.022

Where:

U<INF>o</INF> = the area-weighted average thermal transmittance of the 
gross area of the building envelope; i.e., the exterior wall assembly 
including fenestration and doors, the roof and ceiling assembly, and the 
floor assembly, Btu/(h[middot]ft\2\[middot][deg]F)
A<INF>o</INF> = the gross area of the building envelope, ft\2\
U<INF>i</INF> = the thermal transmittance of each individual path of the 
building envelope, i.e., the opaque portion or the fenestration, Btu/
(h[middot]ft\2\[middot][deg]F)
U<INF>i</INF> = 1/R<INF>i</INF> (where R<INF>i</INF> is the total 
resistance to heat flow of an individual path through the building 
envelope)
A<INF>i</INF> = the area of each individual element of the building 
envelope, ft\2\

    The thermal transmittance of each component of the building envelope 
shall be determined with due consideration of all major series and 
parallel heat flow paths through the elements of the component and film 
coefficients and shall account for any compression of insulation. The 
thermal transmittance of opaque elements of assemblies shall be 
determined using a series path procedure with corrections for the 
presence of parallel paths within an element of the envelope assembly 
(such as wall cavities with parallel paths through insulation and 
studs). The thermal performance of adjacent ground in below-grade 
applications shall be excluded from all thermal calculations.
    402.1.2.1 Envelope Assemblies Containing Metal Framing. The thermal 
transmittance of the envelope assembly containing metal framing shall be 
determined from one of three methods:
    (a) Laboratory or field test measurements based on RS-5, RS-6, RS-7, 
or RS-8 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 434.701).
    (b) The zone method described in Chapter 22 of RS-4 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 434.701) and the formulas on page 22.10.

[[Page 497]]

    (c) For metal roof trusses or metal studs covered by Tables 
402.1.2.1a and b, the total resistance of the series path shall be 
calculated in accordance with the following Equations:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.023

Where:

R<INF>t</INF> = the total resistance of the envelope assembly
R<INF>i</INF> = the resistance of the series elements (for i = 1 to n) 
excluding the parallel path element(s)
R<INF>e</INF> = the equivalent resistance of the element containing the 
parallel path (R-value of insulation x F<INF>c</INF>). Values for 
F<INF>c</INF> and equivalent resistances shall be taken from Tables 
402.1.2.1a or b.

Calculation of the overall thermal transmittance of fenestration 
assemblies shall consider the center-of-glass, edge-of-glass, and frame 
components.
    (a) The following equation 402.1.2.4a shall be used.

[[Page 498]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.024

Where:

U<INF>of</INF> = the overall thermal transmittance of the fenestration 
assemblies, including the center-of-glass, edge-of-glass, and frame 
components, Btu/(h[middot]ft\2\[middot][deg]F)
i = numerical subscript (1, 2, . . .n) refers to each of the various 
fenestration types present in the wall
n = the number of fenestration assemblies in the wall assembly
U<INF>cg</INF> = the thermal transmittance of the center-of-glass area, 
Btu/(h[middot]ft\2\[middot][deg]F)
A<INF>cg</INF> = the center of glass area, that is the overall visible 
glass area minus the edge-of-glass area, ft\2\
U<INF>eg</INF> = the thermal transmittance of the edge of the visible 
glass area including the effects of spacers in multiple glazed units, 
Btu/(h[middot]ft\2\[middot][deg]F)
A<INF>eg</INF> = the edge of the visible glass area, that is the 2.5 in. 
perimeter band adjacent to the frame, ft\2\

of the RS-4 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 434.701). The generic 
product C in Table 13, Chapter 27, is based on a product of 24 ft\2\. 
Larger units will produce lower U-values and thus it is recommended to 
use the calculation procedure detailed in Equation 402.1.2.4a.
    (3) Calculations based on the actual area for center-of-glass, edge-
of-glass, and frame assemblies and on the thermal transmittance of 
components derived from 402.1.2.4a, 402.1.2.4b or a combination of the

handlers and dampers shall be operable. The building shall be 
unoccupied.
    (c) During the testing period, the average wind speed during the 
test shall be less than 6.6 feet per second, the average outside 
temperature greater than 59[deg]F, and the average inside-outside 
temperature difference is less than 41[deg]F.
    402.2.2.5 Moisture Migration. The building envelope shall be 
designed to limit moisture migration that leads to deterioration in 
insulation or equipment performance as determined by the following 
construction practices:
    (a) A vapor retarder shall be installed to retard, or slow down the 
rate of water vapor diffusion through the building envelope. The 
position of the vapor retarder shall be determined taking into account 
local climate and indoor humidity levels. The methodologies presented in 
Chapter 20 of RS-4 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 434.701) shall 
be used to determine temperature and water vapor profiles through the 
envelope systems to assess the potential for condensation within the 
envelope and to determine the position of the vapor retarder within the 
envelope system.
    (b) The vapor retarder shall be installed over the entire building 
envelope.
    (c) The perm rating requirements of the vapor retarder shall be 
determined using the methodologies contained in Chapter 20 of RS-4, 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 434.701) and shall take into 
account local climate and indoor humidity level. The vapor retarder 
shall have a performance rating of 1 perm or less.
    402.3 Thermal Performance Criteria.
    402.3.1 Roofs; Floors and Walls Adjacent to Unconditioned Spaces. 
The area weighted average thermal transmittance of roofs and also of 
floors and walls adjacent to unconditioned spaces shall not exceed the 
criteria in Table 402.3.1a. Exceptions are as follows: Skylights for 
which daylight credit is taken may be excluded from the calculations of 
the roof assembly U<INF>or</INF> if all of the following conditions are 
met:
    (a) The opaque roof thermal transmittance is less than the criteria 
in Table 402.3.1b.
    (b) Skylight areas, including framing, as a percentage of the roof 
area do not exceed the values specified in Table 402.3.1b. The maximum 
skylight area from Table 402.3.1b may be increased by 50% if a shading 
device is used that blocks over 50% of the solar gain during the peak 
cooling design condition. For shell buildings, the permitted skylight 
area shall be based on a light level of 30 foot candles and a lighting 
power density (LPD) of less than 1.0 w/ft \2\. For speculative 
buildings, the permitted skylight area shall be based on the unit 
lighting power allowance from Table 401.3.2a and an illuminance level

[[Page 501]]

as follows: for LPD < 1.0, use 30 footcandles; for 1.0 < LPD < 2.5, use 
50 footcandles; and for LPD <ls-thn-eq>= 2.5, use 70 footcandles.
    (c) All electric lighting fixtures within daylighted zones under 
skylights are controlled by automatic daylighting controls.
    (d) The U<INF>o</INF> of the skylight assembly including framing 
does not exceed------------Btu/(h[middot]ft \2\[middot][deg]F) [Use 0.70 
for <= 8000 HDD65 and 0.45 for <ls-thn-eq>8000 HDD65 or both if the 
jurisdiction includes cities that are both below and above 8000 HDD65.]
    (e) Skylight curb U-value does not exceed 0.21 Btu/(h[middot]ft 
\2\[middot][deg]F).
    (f) The infiltration coefficient of the skylights does not exceed 
0.05 cfm/ft \2\.
    402.3.2 Below-Grade Walls and Slabs-on-Grade. The thermal resistance 
(R-value) of insulation for slabs-on-grade, or the overall thermal 
resistance of walls in contact with the earth, shall be equal to or 
greater than the values in Table 402.3.2.
    402.4 Exterior Walls. Exterior walls shall comply with either 
402.4.1 or 402.4.2.
    402.4.1 Prescriptive Criteria. (a) The exterior wall shall be 
designed in accordance with subsections 402.4.1.1 and 402.4.1.2. When 
the internal load density range is not known, the 0-1.50 W/ft \2\ range 
shall be used for residential, hotel/motel guest rooms, or warehouse 
occupancies; the 3.01-3.50 w/ft \2\ range shall be used for retail 
stores smaller than 2,000 ft \2\ and technical and vocational schools 
smaller than 10,000 ft \2\; and the 1.51-3.00 W/ft \2\ range shall be 
used for all other occupancies and building sizes. When the building 
envelope is designed or constructed prior to knowing the building 
occupancy type, an internal load density of ------ W/ft \2\ shall be 
used. [Use 3.0 W/ft \2\ for HDD65 <3000, 2.25 W/ft \2\ for 3000 < HDD65 
< 6000, and 1.5 W/ft \2\ for HDD65 <ls-thn-eq> 6000.]
    (b) When more than one condition exists, area weighted averages 
shall be used. This requirement shall apply to all thermal 
transmittances, shading coefficients, projection factors, and internal 
load densities rounded to the same number of decimal places as shown in 
the respective table.
    402.4.1.1 Opaque Walls. The weighted average thermal transmittance 
(U-value) of opaque wall elements shall be less than the values in Table 
402.4.1.1. For mass walls (HC <ls-thn-eq>= 5), criteria are presented 
for low and high window/wall ratios and the criteria shall be determined 
by interpolating between these values for the window/wall ratio of the 
building.
    402.4.1.2 Fenestration. The design of the fenestration shall meet 
the criteria of Table 402.4.1.2. When the fenestration columns labeled 
``Perimeter Daylighting'' are used, automatic daylighting controls shall 
be installed in the perimeter daylighted zones of the building. These 
daylighting controls shall be capable of reducing electric lighting 
power to at least 50% of full power. Only those shading or lighting 
controls for perimeter daylighting that are shown on the plans shall be 
considered. The column labeled ``VLT <ls-thn-eq> = SC'' shall be used 
only when the shading coefficient of the glass is less than its visible 
light transmittance.

subpart C of this part.

[[Page 507]]

    403.2.2 Equipment and System Sizing. Heating and cooling equipment 
and systems shall be sized to provide no more than the loads calculated 
in accordance with subsection 403.2.1. A single piece of equipment 
providing both heating and cooling must satisfy this provision for one

capacities exceeding the design load and provided with controls that 
sequence or otherwise optimally control the operation of each unit based 
on load.
    403.2.3 Separate Air Distribution System. Zones with special process 
temperature and/or humidity requirements shall be served by air 
distribution systems separate from those serving zones requiring only 
comfort conditions or shall include supplementary provisions so that the 
primary systems may be specifically controlled for comfort purposes 
only. Exceptions: Zones requiring only comfort heating or comfort 
cooling that are served by a system primarily used for process 
temperature and humidity control need not be served by a separate system 
if the total supply air to these comfort zones is no more than 25% of 
the total system supply air or the total conditioned floor area of the 
zones is less than 1000 ft2.
    403.2.4 Ventilation and Fan System Design. Ventilation systems shall 
be designed to be capable of reducing the supply of outdoor air to the 
minimum ventilation rates required by Section 6.1.3 of RS-41 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 434.701) through the use of return 
ducts, manually or automatically operated control dampers, fan volume 
controls, or other devices. Exceptions are as follows: Minimum outdoor 
air rates may be greater if:
    (a) Required to make up air exhausted for source control of 
contaminants such as in a fume hood.
    (b) Required by process systems.
    (c) Required to maintain a slightly positive building pressure. For 
this purpose, minimum outside air intake may be increased up to no 
greater than 0.30 air changes per hour in excess of exhaust quantities.

people per 1,000 ft\2\ shall include means to automatically reduce 
outside air intake to the minimum values required by RS-41 (incorporated 
by reference, see Sec. 434.701) during unoccupied or low-occupancy 
periods. Outside air shall not be reduced below 0.14 cfm/ft\2\. Outside 
air intake shall be controlled by one or more of the following:
    (a) A clearly labeled, readily accessible bypass timer that may be 
used by occupants or operating personnel to temporarily increase minimum 
outside air flow up to design levels.
    (b) A carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>) control system having sensors 
located in the spaces served, or in the return air from the spaces 
served, capable of maintaining space CO<INF>2</INF> concentrations below 
levels recommended by the manufacturer, but no fewer than one sensor per 
25,000 ft\2\ of occupied space shall be provided.
    (c) An automatic timeclock that can be programmed to maintain 
minimum outside air intake levels commensurate with scheduled occupancy 
levels.
    (d) Spaces equipped with occupancy sensors.
    403.2.4.2 Ventilation Controls for enclosed parking garages. Garage 
ventilation fan systems with a total design capacity greater than 30,000 
cfm shall have automatic controls that stage fans or modulate fan volume 
as required to maintain carbon monoxide (CO) below levels recommended in 
RS-41.

each HVAC system at design conditions shall not exceed 0.8 W/cfm of 
supply air for constant air volume systems and 1.25 W/cfm of supply air 
for variable-

[[Page 508]]

air-volume (VAV) systems. Fan system energy demand shall not include the 
additional power required by air treatment or filtering systems with 
pressure drops over 1 in. w.c. Individual VAV fans with motors 75 hp and 
larger shall include controls and devices necessary for the fan motor to 
demand no more than 30 percent of design wattage at 50 percent of design 
air volume, based on manufacturer's test data. Exceptions are as 
follows:

heating and/or comfort air conditioning that serve control valves 
designed to modulate or step open and closed as a function of load shall 
be designed for variable fluid flow and capable of reducing system flow 
to 50 percent of design flow or less. Exceptions are as follows:
    (a) Systems where a minimum flow greater than 50% of the design flow 
is required for the proper operation of equipment served by the system, 
such as chillers.
    (b) Systems that serve no more than one control valve.
    (c) Systems with a total pump system horse power <=10 hp.

follows: Independent perimeter systems that are designed to offset 
building envelope heat losses or gains or both may serve one or more 
zones also served by an interior system when the perimeter system 
includes at least one thermostatic control zone for each building 
exposure having exterior walls facing only one orientation for at least 
50 contiguous ft and the perimeter system heating and cooling supply is 
controlled by thermostat(s) located within the zone(s) served by the 
system.
    403.2.6.3 Zone Thermostatic Control Capabilities. Where used to 
control comfort heating, zone thermostatic controls shall be capable of 
being set locally or remotely by adjustment or selection of sensors down 
to 55[deg]F or lower. Where used to control comfort cooling, zone 
thermostatic controls shall be capable of being set locally or remotely

used to control both comfort heating and cooling, zone thermostatic 
controls shall be capable of providing a temperature range or deadband 
of at least 5[deg]F within which the supply of heating and cooling 
energy to the zone is shut off or reduced to a minimum. Exceptions are 
as follows:
    (a) Special occupancy or special usage conditions approved by the 
building official or
    (b) Thermostats that require manual changeover between heating and 
cooling modes.

other simultaneous operation of heating and cooling systems to

[[Page 509]]

the same zone. Exceptions are as follows:
    (a) Variable-air-volume systems that, during periods of occupancy, 
are designed to reduce the air supply to each zone to a minimum before 
heating, recooling, or mixing takes place. This minimum volume shall be 
no greater than the larger of 30% of the peak supply volume, the minimum 
required to meet minimum ventilation requirements of the Federal agency. 
(0.4 cfm/ft\2\ of zone conditioned floor area, and 300 cfm).
    (b) Zones where special pressurization relationships or cross-
contamination requirements are such that variable-air-volume systems are 
impractical, such as isolation rooms, operating areas of hospitals and 
clean rooms.

temperature. Temperature shall be reset by at least 25% of the design 
supply-to-return water temperature difference. Exceptions are as 
follows:
    (a) Systems that comply with subsection 403.2.5 without exception or

    403.2.7.3 Zone Isolation systems that serve zones that can be 
expected to operate nonsimultaneously for more than 750 hours per year 
shall include isolation devices and controls to shut off or set back the 
supply of heating and cooling to each zone independently. Isolation is 
not required for zones expected to operate continuously or expected to 
be inoperative only when all other zones are inoperative. For buildings 
where occupancy patterns are not known at the time of system design, 
such as speculative buildings, the designer may predesignate isolation 
areas. The grouping of zones on one floor into a single isolation area 
shall

[[Page 510]]

be permitted when the total conditioned floor area does not exceed

humidification, dehumidification, and supermarket refrigeration systems, 
so as to increase overall energy usage.
    (d) Systems that serve envelope-dominated spaces whose sensible 
cooling load at design conditions, excluding transmission and 
infiltration loads, is less than or equal to transmission and

controls that preclude economizer operation whenever mechanical cooling 
is required simultaneously.
    (b) Systems in climates with less than 750 average operating hours 
per year between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. when the ambient dry-bulb 
temperatures are between 55 [deg]F and 69 [deg]F inclusive.
    403.2.8.3 System design and economizer controls shall be such that 
economizer operation does not increase the building heating energy use 
during normal operation.

  listed in this table for applicable fluid temperature and pipe size, K = conductivity of alternate material at
  mean rating temperature indicated for the applicable fluid temperature (Btu in/h ft\2\ F); and k = the upper
  value of the conductivity range listed in this table for the applicable fluid temperature.
b These thicknesses are based on energy efficiency considerations only. Safety issues, such as insulation
  surface temperatures, have not been considered.

recorded on control drawings, at control devices, or, for digital 
control systems, in programming comments.
    (e) A complete narrative, prepared by the designer, of how each 
system is intended to operate shall be included with the construction 
documents.
    403.2.10.2 Drawings. Construction documents shall require that 
within 30 days after the date of system acceptance, record drawings of 
the actual installation be provided to the Federal agency. The drawings 
shall include details of the air barrier installation in every envelope 
component, demonstrating continuity of the air barrier at all joints and 
penetrations.
    403.2.10.3 Air System Balancing. Construction documents shall 
require that all HVAC systems be balanced in accordance with the 
industry accepted procedures (such as National Environmental Balancing 
Bureau (NEBB) Procedural Standards, Associated Air Balance Council 
(AABC) National Standards, or ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 111). Air and water 
flow rates shall be measured and adjusted to deliver final flow rates 
within 10% of design rates, except variable flow distribution systems 
need not be balanced upstream of the controlling device (VAV box or 
control valve).
    403.2.10.3.1 Construction documents shall require a written balance 
report be provided to the Federal agency for HVAC systems serving zones 
with a total conditioned area exceeding 5,000 ft\2\.
    403.2.10.3.2 Air systems shall be balanced in a manner to first 
minimize throttling losses, then fan speed shall be adjusted to meet 
design flow conditions or equivalent procedures. Exceptions are as 
follows: Damper throttling may be used for air system balancing;
    (a) With fan motors of 1 hp (0.746 kW) or less, or
    (b) Of throttling results in no greater than \1/3\ hp (0.248 kW) fan 
horsepower draw above that required if the fan speed were adjusted.
    403.2.10.4 Hydronic System Balancing. Hydronic systems shall be 
balanced in a manner to first minimize throttling losses; then the pump 
impeller shall be trimmed or pump speed shall be adjusted to meet design 
flow conditions. Exceptions are as follows:

    404.1 Service Water Heating Equipment Efficiency. Equipment must 
satisfy the minimum performance efficiency specified in Table 404.1 when 
tested in accordance with RS-37, RS-38, or RS-39 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 434.701). Omission of equipment from Table 404.1 
shall not preclude the use of such equipment. Service water heating 
equipment used to provide additional function of space heating as part 
of a combination (integrated) system shall satisfy all stated 
requirements for the service water heating equipment. All gas-fired 
storage water heaters that are not equipped with a flue damper and use 
indoor air for combustion or draft hood dilution and that are installed 
in a conditioned space, shall be equipped with a vent damper listed in 
accordance with RS-42 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 434.701). 
Unless the water heater has an available electrical supply, the 
installation of such a vent damper shall not require an electrical 
connection.

    404.1.1 Testing Electric and Oil Storage Water Heaters for Standby 
Loss.
    (a) When testing an electric storage water heater, the procedures of 
Z21.10.3-1990 (RS-39, incorporated by reference, see Sec. 434.701), 
Section 2.9, shall be used. The electrical supply voltage shall be 
maintained with <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1% of the center of the voltage 
range specified on the water heater nameplate. Also, when needed for 
calculations, the thermal efficiency (E<INF>t</INF>) shall be 98%. When 
testing an oil-fired water heater, the procedures of Z21.10.3-1990 (RS-
39 incorporated by reference, see Sec. 434.701), Sections 2.8 and 2.9, 
shall be used.
    (b) The following modifications shall be made: A vertical length of 
flue pipe shall be connected to the flue gas outlet of sufficient height 
to establish the minimum draft specified in the manufacturer's 
installation instructions. All measurements of oil consumption shall be 
taken by instruments with an accuracy of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1% or 
better. The burner rate shall be adjusted to achieve an hourly Btu input 
rate within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2% of the manufacturer's specified 
input rate with the CO<INF>2</INF> reading as specified by the 
manufacturer with smoke no greater than 1 and the fuel pump pressure 
within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1% of the manufacturer's specification.
    404.1.2 Unfired Storage Tanks. The heat loss of the tank surface 
area Btu/(h[middot]ft\2\) shall be based on an 80[deg]F water-air 
temperature difference.
    404.1.3 Storage Volume Symbols in Table 404.1. The symbol ``V'' is 
the rated storage volume in gallons as specified by the manufacturer. 
The symbol ``V<INF>T</INF>'' is the storage volume in gallons as 
measured during the test to determine the standby loss. V<INF>T</INF> 
may differ from V, but it is within tolerances allowed by the applicable 
Z21 and Underwriters Laboratories standards. Accordingly, for the 
purpose of estimating the standby loss requirement using the rated 
volume shown on the rating plate, V<INF>T</INF> should be considered as 
no less than 0.95V for gas and oil water heaters and no less than 0.90V 
for electric water heaters.
    404.1.4 Electric Water Heaters. In applications where water 
temperatures not greater than 145[deg]F are required, an economic 
evaluation shall be made on the potential benefit of using an electric 
heat pump water heater(s) instead of an electric resistance water 
heater(s). The analysis shall compare the extra installed costs of the 
heat pump unit with the benefits in reduced energy costs (less increased 
maintenance costs) over the estimated service life of the heat pump 
water heater. Exceptions are as follows: Electric water heaters used in 
conjunction with site-recovered or site-solar energy sources that 
provide 50% or more of the water heating load or off-peak heating with 
thermal storage.
    404.2 Service Hot Water Piping Insulation. Circulating system piping 
and noncirculating systems without heat traps, the first eight feet of 
outlet piping from a constant-temperature noncirculating storage system, 
and the inlet pipe between the storage tank and a heat trap in a 
noncirculating storage system shall meet the provisions of subsection 
403.2.9.
    404.2.1 Vertical risers serving storage water heaters not having an 
integral heat trap and serving a noncirculating system shall have heat 
traps on both the inlet and outlet piping as close as practical to the 
water heater.
    404.3 Service Water Heating System Controls. Temperature controls 
that allow for storage temperature adjustment from 110[deg]F to a 
temperature compatible with the intended use shall be provided in 
systems serving residential dwelling units and from 90[deg]F for other 
systems. When designed to maintain usage temperatures in hot water 
pipes, such as circulating hot water systems or heat trace, the system 
shall be equipped with automatic time switches or other controls that 
can be set to turn off the system.
    404.3.1 The outlet temperature of lavatory faucets in public 
facility restrooms shall be limited to 110[deg]F.
    404.4 Water Conservation. Showerheads and lavatory faucets must meet 
the requirements of 10 CFR 430.32 (o)-(p).
    404.4.1 Lavatory faucets in public facility restrooms shall be 
equipped with a foot switch, occupancy sensor, or similar device or, in 
other than lavatories for physically handicapped persons, limit water 
delivery to 0.25 gal/cycle.

[[Page 515]]

    404.5 Swimming Pools. All pool heaters shall be equipped with a 
readily accessible on-off switch.
    404.5.1 Time switches shall be installed on electric heaters and 
pumps. Exceptions are as follows:
    (a) Pumps required to operate solar or heat recovery pool heating 
systems.
    (b) Where public health requirements require 24-hour pump operation.
    404.5.2 Heated swimming pools shall be equipped with pool covers. 
Exception: When over 70% of the annual energy for heating is obtained 
from a site-recovered or site-solar energy source.
    404.6 Combined Service Water Heating and Space Heating Equipment. A 
single piece of equipment shall not be used to provide both space 
heating and service water heating. Exceptions are as follows:
    (a) The energy input or storage volume of the combined boiler or 
water heater is less than twice the energy input or storage volume of 
the smaller of the separate boilers or water heaters otherwise required 
or
    (b) The input to the combined boiler is less than 150,000 Btuh.

          Subpart E_Building Energy Cost Compliance Alternative


<R05>
Sec. 434.501  General.

    501.1 Subpart E permits the use of the Building Energy Cost 
Compliance Alternative as an alternative to many elements of subpart D. 
When this subpart is used, it must be used with subpart C and subpart D, 
401.1, 401.2, 401.3.4 and in conjunction with the minimum requirements 
found in subsections 402.1, 402.2, and 402.3., 403.1, 403.2.1-7, 403.2.9 
and 404.
    501.2 Compliance. Compliance under this method requires detailed 
energy analyses of the entire Proposed Design, referred to as the Design 
Energy Consumption; an estimate of annual energy cost for the proposed 
design, referred to as the Design Energy Cost; and comparison against an 
Energy Cost Budget. Compliance is achieved when the estimated Design 
Energy Cost is less than or equal to the Energy Cost Budget. This 
subpart provides instructions for determining the Energy Cost Budget and 
for calculating the Design Energy Consumption and Design Energy Cost. 
The Energy Cost Budget shall be determined through the calculation of 
monthly energy consumption and energy cost of a Prototype or Reference 
Building design configured to meet the requirements of subsections 401 
through 404.
    501.3 Designers are encouraged to employ the Building Energy Cost 
Budget compliance method set forth in this section for evaluating 
proposed design alternatives to using the elements prescribed in subpart 
D. The Building Energy Cost Budget establishes the relative 
effectiveness of each design alternative in energy cost savings, 
providing an energy cost basis upon which the building owner and 
designer may select one design over another. This Energy Cost Budget is 
the highest allowable calculated energy cost for a specific building 
design. Other alternative designs are likely to have lower annual energy 
costs and life cycle costs than those used to minimally meet the Energy 
Cost Budget.
    501.4 The Energy Cost Budget is a numerical reference for annual 
energy cost. It's purpose is to assure neutrality with respect to 
choices such as HVAC system type, architectural design and fuel choice 
by providing a fixed, repeatable budget that is independent of any of 
these choices wherever possible (i.e., for the prototype buildings). The 
Energy Cost Budget for a given building size and type will vary only 
with climate, the number of stories, and the choice of simulation tool. 
The specifications of the prototypes are necessary to assure 
repeatability, but have no other significance. They are not necessarily 
recommended energy conserving practice, or even physically reasonable 
practice for some climates or buildings, but represent a reasonable 
worst case of energy cost resulting from compliance with the provisions 
of subsections 401 through 404.


<R05>
Sec. 434.502  Determination of the annual energy cost budget.

    502.1 The annual Energy Cost Budgets shall be determined in 
accordance with the Prototype Building Procedure in Sec. 434.503 and 
Sec. 434.504 or the Reference Building Procedure in Sec. 434.505. Both 
methods calculate an annual Energy

[[Page 516]]

Cost by summing the 12 monthly Energy Cost Budgets. Each monthly Energy 
Cost Budget is the product of the monthly Building Energy Consumption of 
each type of energy used multiplied by the monthly Energy Cost per unit 
of energy for each type of energy used.
    502.2 The Energy Cost Budget shall be determined in accordance with 
Equation 502.2.a as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.025


Based on:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.026

Where:

ECB = The annual Energy Cost Budget
ECB<INF>m</INF> = The monthly Energy Cost Budget
BECON<INF>mi</INF> = The monthly Budget Energy Consumption of the 
i<INF>th</INF> type of energy
ECOS<INF>mi</INF> = The monthly Energy Cost, per unit of the 
i<INF>th</INF> type of energy

    502.3 The monthly Energy Cost Budget shall be determined using 
current rate schedules or contract prices available at the building site 
for all types of energy purchased. These costs shall include demand 
charges, rate blocks, time of use rates, interruptible service rates, 
delivery charges, taxes, and all other applicable rates for the type, 
location, operation, and size of the proposed design. The monthly Budget 
Energy Consumption shall be calculated from the first day through the 
last day of each month, inclusive.


<R05>
Sec. 434.503  Prototype building procedure.

    503.1 The Prototype Building procedure shall be used for all 
building types listed below. For mixed-use buildings the Energy Cost 
Budget is derived by allocating the floor space of each building type 
within the floor space of the prototype building. For buildings not 
listed below, the Reference Building procedure of Sec. 434.505 shall be 
used. Prototype buildings include:
    (a) Assembly;
    (b) Office (Business);
    (c) Retail (Mercantile);
    (d) Warehouse (Storage);
    (e) School (Educational);
    (f) Hotel/Motel;
    (g) Restaurant;
    (h) Health/Institutional; and
    (i) Multi-Family.


<R05>
Sec. 434.504  Use of the prototype building to determine the energy cost budget.

    504.1 Determine the building type of the Proposed Design using the 
categories in subsection 503.1. Using the appropriate Prototype Building 
characteristics from all of the tables contained in Subpart E, the 
building shall be simulated using the same gross floor area and number 
of floors for the Prototype Building as in the Proposed Design.
    504.2 The form, orientation, occupancy and use profiles for the 
Prototype Building shall be fixed as described in subsection 511. 
Envelope, lighting, other internal loads and HVAC systems and equipment 
shall meet the requirements of subsection 301, 401, 402, 403, and 404 
and are standardized inputs.


<R05>
Sec. 434.505  Reference building method.

    505.1 The Reference Building procedure shall be used only when the 
Proposed Design cannot be represented by one or a combination of the 
Prototype Building listed in subsection 503.1 or the assumptions for the 
Prototype Building in Subsection 510, such as occupancy and use-
profiles, do not reasonably represent the Proposed Design.

[[Page 517]]


<R05>
Sec. 434.506  Use of the reference building to determine the energy cost budget.

    506.1 Each floor shall be oriented in the same manner for the 
Reference Building as in the Proposed Design. The form, gross and 
conditioned floor areas of each floor and the number of floors shall be 
the same as in the Proposed Design. All other characteristics, such as 
lighting, envelope and HVAC systems and equipment, shall meet the 
requirements of subsections 301, 401, 402, 403 and 404.


<R05>
Sec. 434.507  Calculation procedure and simulation tool.

    507.1 The Prototype or Reference Buildings shall be modeled using 
the criteria of subsections 510 and 521. The modeling shall use a 
climate data set appropriate for both the site and the complexity of the 
energy conserving features of the design. ASHRAE Weather Year for Energy 
Calculations (WYEC) data or bin weather data shall be used in the 
absence of other appropriate data.


<R05>
Sec. 434.508  Determination of the design energy consumption and design energy cost.

    508.1 The Design Energy Consumption shall be calculated by modeling 
the Proposed Design using the same methods, assumptions, climate data, 
and simulation tool as were used to establish the Energy Cost Budget, 
except as explicitly stated in 509 through 534. The Design Energy Cost 
shall be calculated per Equation 508.1.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.027


Based on:


DECOS<INF>m</INF> = DECON<INF>ml</INF> x ECOS<INF>ml</INF> +. . .+ 
DECON<INF>mi</INF> x ECOS<INF>mi</INF> (Equation 508.1.2)

Where:

DECOS = The annual Design Energy Cost
DECOS<INF>m</INF> = The monthly Design Energy Cost
DECON<INF>mi</INF> = The monthly Design Energy Consumption of the 
i<INF>th</INF> type of energy
ECOS<INF>mi</INF> = The monthly Energy Cost per unit of the 
i<INF>th</INF> type of energy

    The DECON<INF>mi</INF> shall be calculated from the first day 
through the last day of the month, inclusive.


<R05>
Sec. 434.509  Compliance.

    509.1 If the Design Energy Cost is less than or equal to the Energy 
Cost Budget, and all of the minimum requirements of subsection 501.2 are 
met, the Proposed Design complies with the standards.


<R05>
Sec. 434.510  Standard calculation procedure.

    510.1 The Standard Calculation Procedure consists of methods and 
assumptions for calculating the Energy Cost Budget for the Prototype or 
Reference Building and the Design Energy Consumption and Design Energy 
Cost of the Proposed Design. In order to maintain consistency between 
the Energy Cost Budget and the Design Energy Cost, the input assumptions 
to be used are stated below. These inputs shall be used to determine the 
Energy Cost Budget and the Design Energy Consumption.
    510.2 Prescribed assumptions shall be used without variation. 
Default assumptions shall be used unless the designer can demonstrate 
that a different assumption better characterizes the building's energy 
use over its expected life. The default assumptions shall be used in 
modeling both the Prototype or Reference Building and the Proposed 
Design, unless the designer demonstrates clear cause to modify these 
assumptions. Special procedures for speculative buildings are discussed 
in subsection 503. Shell buildings may not use subpart E.

Sec. 434.511  Orientation and shape.

    511.1 The Prototype Building shall consist of the same number of 
stories, and gross and conditioned floor area as the Proposed Design, 
with equal area per story. The building shape shall be rectangular, with 
a 2.5:1 aspect ratio. The long dimensions of the building shall face 
East and West. The fenestration shall be uniformly distributed in 
proportion to exterior wall area. Floor-to-floor height for the 
Prototype Building shall be 13 ft. except for dwelling units in hotels/
motels and multi-family high-rise residential buildings where floor-to-
floor height shall be 9.5 ft.
    511.2 The Reference Building shall consist of the same number of 
stories, and gross floor area for each story as the Proposed Design. 
Each floor shall be oriented in the same manner as the Proposed Design. 
The geometric form shall be the same as the Proposed Design.

Sec. 434.512  Internal loads.

    512.1 The systems and types of energy specified in this section are 
provided only for purposes of calculating the Energy Cost Budget. They 
are not requirements for either systems or the type of energy to be used 
in the Proposed Design or for calculation of Design Energy Cost.
    512.2 Internal loads for multi-family high-rise residential 
buildings are prescribed in Tables 512.2.a and b, Multi-Family High Rise 
Residential Building Schedules. Internal loads for other building types 
shall be modeled as noted in this subsection.

Sec. 434.514  Lighting.

    514.1 Interior Lighting Power Allowance (ILPA), for calculating the 
Energy Cost Budget shall be determined from subsection 401.3.2. The 
lighting power used to calculate the Design Energy Consumption shall be 
the actual adjusted power for lighting in the Proposed Design. If the 
lighting controls in the Proposed Design are more effective at saving 
energy than those required by subsection 401.3.1 and 401.3.2, the actual 
installed lighting power shall be used along with the schedules 
reflecting the action of the controls to calculate the Design Energy 
Consumption. This actual installed lighting

[[Page 526]]

power shall not be adjusted by the Power Adjustment Factors listed in 
Table 514.1.

    514.2 Table 513.2.b establishes default assumptions for the 
percentage of the lighting load switched-on in each Prototype or 
Reference Building by hour of the day. These default assumptions can be 
changed when calculating the Energy Cost Budget to provide, for example, 
a 12-hour rather than an 8-hour workday.


<R05>
Sec. 434.515  Receptacles.

    515.1 Receptacle loads and profiles are default assumptions. The 
same assumptions shall be made in calculating Design Energy Consumption 
as were used in calculating the Energy Cost Budget.
    515.2 Receptacle loads include all general service loads that are 
typical in a building. These loads exclude any process electrical usage 
and HVAC primary or auxiliary electrical usage. Table 515.2, Receptacle 
Power Densities, establishes the density, in W/ft\2\, to be used for 
each building type. The receptacle energy profiles shall be the same as 
the lighting energy profiles in Table 513.2.b. This profile establishes 
the percentage of the receptacle load that is switched on by hour of the 
day and by building type.

Sec. 434.516  Building exterior envelope.

    516.1 Insulation and Glazing. The insulation and glazing 
characteristics of the Prototype and Reference Building envelope shall 
be determined by using the first column under ``Base Case'', with no 
assumed overhangs, for the appropriate Alternate Component Tables (ACP) 
in Table 402.4.1.2, as defined by climate range. The insulation and 
glazing characteristics from this ACP are prescribed assumptions for 
Prototype and Reference Buildings for calculating the Energy Cost 
Budget. In calculating the Design Energy Consumption of the Proposed 
Design, the envelope characteristics of the Proposed Design shall be 
used.
    516.2 Infiltration. For Prototype and Reference Buildings, the 
infiltration assumptions in subsection 516.2.1 shall be prescribed 
assumptions for calculating the Energy Cost Budget and default 
assumptions for the Design Energy Consumption. Infiltration shall impact 
perimeter zones only.
    516.2.1 When the HVAC system is switched ``on,'' no infiltration 
shall be assumed. When the HVAC system is switched ``off,'' the 
infiltration rate for buildings with or without operable windows shall 
be assumed to be 0.038 cfm/ft\2\ of gross exterior wall. Hotels/motels 
and multi-family high-rise residential buildings shall have infiltration 
rates of 0.038 cfm/ft\2\ of gross exterior wall area at all times.
    516.3 Envelope and Ground Absorptivities. For Prototype and 
Reference Buildings, absorptivity assumptions shall be prescribed 
assumptions for computing the Energy Cost Budget and default assumptions 
for computing the Design Energy Consumption. The solar absorptivity of 
opaque elements of the building envelope is assumed to be 70%. The solar 
absorptivity of ground surfaces is assumed to be 80% (20% reflectivity).
    516.4 Window Management. For the Prototype and Reference Building, 
window management drapery assumptions shall be prescribed assumptions 
for setting the Energy Cost Budget. No draperies shall be the default 
assumption for computing the Design Energy Consumption. Glazing is 
assumed to be internally shaded by medium-weight draperies, closed one-
half time. The

[[Page 527]]

draperies shall be modeled by assuming that one-half the area in each 
zone is draped and one-half is not. If manually-operated draperies, 
shades, or blinds are to be used in the Proposed Design, the Design 
Energy Consumption shall be calculated by assuming they are effective 
over one-half the glazing area in each zone.
    516.5 Shading. For Prototype and Reference buildings and the 
Proposed Design, shading by permanent structures, terrain, and 
vegetation shall be taken into account for computing energy consumption, 
whether or not these features are located on the building site. A 
permanent fixture is one that is likely to remain for the life of the 
Proposed Design.


<R05>
Sec. 434.517  HVAC systems and equipment.

    517.1 The specifications and requirements for the HVAC systems of 
the Prototype and Reference Buildings shall be those in Table 517.1.1, 
HVAC Systems for Prototype and Reference Buildings. For the calculation 
of the Design Energy Consumption, the HVAC systems and equipment of the 
Proposed Design shall be used.
    517.2 The systems and types of energy presented in Table 517.1.1 are 
assumptions for calculating the Energy Cost Budget. They are not 
requirements for either systems or the type of energy to be used in the 
Proposed Building or for the calculation of the Design Energy Cost.

\1\ Space and Service Water Heating budget calculations shall be made
  using both electricity and natural gas. The Energy Cost Budget shall
  be the lower of these two calculations. If natural gas is not
  available at the rate, electricity and <greek-i>2 fuel oil shall be
  used for the budget calculations.
\2\ The system and energy types presented in this Table are not intended
  as requirements or recommendations for the proposed design. Floor
  areas below are the total conditioned floor areas for the listed
  occupancy type in the building. The number of floors indicated below
  is the total number of occupied floors for the listed occupancy type.

    517.3 HVAC Zones. HVAC zones for calculating the Energy Cost Budget 
of the Prototype or Reference Building shall consist of at least four 
perimeter and one interior zones per floor. Prototype Buildings shall 
have one perimeter zone facing each cardinal direction. The perimeter 
zones of Prototype and Reference Buildings shall be 15 ft in width, or 
one-third the narrow dimension of the building, when this dimension is 
between 30 ft and 45 ft inclusive, or one-half the narrow dimension of 
the building when this dimension is less than 30 ft. Zoning requirements 
shall be a default assumption for calculating the Energy Cost Budget. 
For multi-family high-rise residential

[[Page 528]]

buildings, the prototype building shall have one zone per dwelling unit. 
The proposed design shall have one zone per unit unless zonal 
thermostatic controls are provided within units; in this case, two zones 
per unit shall be modeled. Building types such as assembly or warehouse 
may be modeled as a single zone if there is only one space.
    517.4 For calculating the Design Energy Consumption, no fewer zones 
shall be used than were in the Prototype and Reference Buildings. The 
zones in the simulation shall correspond to the zones provided by the 
controls in the Proposed Design. Thermally similar zones, such as those 
facing one orientation on different floors, may be grouped together for 
the purposes of either the Design Energy Consumption or Energy Cost 
Budget simulation.

                    Numbered Notes for Table 517.4.1

     HVAC System Descriptions for Prototype and Reference Buildings

    Notes:
    1. For occupancies such as restaurants, assembly and retail which 
are part of a mixed use building which, according to Table 517.4.1, 
includes a central chilled water plant (systems 3, 5, or 6), chilled 
water system type 3 or 5, as indicated in the Table, shall be used.
    2. Constant volume may be used in zones where pressurization 
relationships must be maintained by code. VAV shall be used in all other 
areas, in accordance with Sec. 517.4
    3. Provide run-around heat recovery systems for all fan systems with 
minimum outside air intake greater than 75%. Recovery effectiveness 
shall be 0.60.
    4. If a warehouse is not intended to be mechanically cooled, both 
the Energy Cost Budgets and Design Energy Costs, may be calculated 
assuming no mechanical cooling.
    5. The system listed is for guest rooms only. Areas such as public 
areas and back-of-house areas shall be served by system 4. Other areas 
such as offices and retail shall be served by the systems listed in 
Table 517.4.1 for those occupancy types.
    6. The system listed is for guest rooms only. Areas such as public 
areas and back-of-house areas shall be served by System 5. Other areas 
such as offices and retail shall be served by the systems listed in 
Table 517.4.1.1 for those occupancy types.
    7. System 2 shall be used for Energy Cost Budget calculation except 
in areas with design heating outside air temperatures less than 
10[deg]F.
    8. Prototype energy budget cost calculations shall be made using 
both electricity and natural gas. If natural gas is not available at the 
site, electricity and <greek-i>2 fuel oil shall be used. The Energy Cost 
Budget shall be the lower of these results. Alternatively, the Energy 
Cost Budget may be based on the fuel source that minimizes total 
operating, maintenance, equipment, and installation costs for the 
prototype over the building lifetime. Equipment and installation cost 
estimates shall be prepared using professionally recognized cost 
estimating tools, guides, and techniques. The methods of analysis shall 
conform to those of Subpart A of 10 CFR part 436. Energy costs shall be 
based on actual costs to the building as defined in this Section.
    9. Design supply air circulation rate shall be based on a supply air 
to room air temperature differences of 20[deg]F. A higher supply air 
temperature may be used if required to maintain a minimum circulation 
rate of 4.5 air changes per hour or 15 cfm per person at design 
conditions to each zone served by the system. If return fans are 
specified, they shall be sized from the supply fan capacity less the 
required minimum ventilation with outside air, or 75% or the supply air 
capacity, whichever is larger. Except where noted, supply and return 
fans shall be operated continually during occupied hours.
    10. Fan System Energy when included in the efficiency rating of the 
unit as defined in Sec. 403.2.4.3 need not be modeled explicitly for 
this system. The fan shall cycle with calls for heating or cooling.
    11. Chilled water systems shall be modeled using a reciprocating 
chiller for systems with total cooling capacities less than 175 tons, 
and centrifugal chillers for systems

[[Page 530]]

with cooling capacities of 175 tons or greater. For systems with cooling 
or 600 ton or more, the Energy Cost Budget shall be calculated using two 
centrifugal chillers lead/lag controlled. Chilled water pumps shall be 
sized using a 12[deg]F temperature rise, from 44[deg]F to 56[deg]F 
operating at 65 feed of head and 65% combined impeller and motor 
efficiency. Condenser water pumps shall be sized using a 10[deg]F 
temperature rise, operating at 60 feet of head and 60% combined impeller 
and motor efficiency. The cooling tower shall be an open circuit, 
centrifugal blower type sized for the larger of 85[deg]F leaving water 
temperature or 10[deg]F approach to design wet bulb temperature. The 
tower shall be controlled to provide a 65[deg]F leaving water 
temperature whenever weather conditions permit, floating up to design 
leaving water temperature at design conditions. Chilled water supply 
temperature shall be reset in accordance with Sec. 434.518.
    12. Hot water system shall include a natural draft fossil fuel or 
electric boiler per Note 8. The hot water pump shall be sized based on a 
30[deg]F temperature drop, for 18[deg]F to 150[deg]F, operating at 60 
feet of head and a combined impeller and motor efficiency of 60%. Hot 
water supply temperature shall be reset in accordance with Sec. 
434.518.

    517.5 Equipment Sizing and Redundant Equipment. For calculating the 
Energy Cost Budget of Prototype or Reference Buildings, HVAC equipment 
shall be sized to meet the requirements of subsection 403.2.2, without 
using any of the exceptions. The size of equipment shall be that 
required for the building without process loads considered. Redundant or 
emergency equipment need not be simulated if it is controlled so that it 
will not be operated during normal operations of the building. The 
designer shall document the installation of process equipment and the 
size of process loads.
    517.6 For calculating the Design Energy Consumption, actual air flow 
rates and installed equipment size shall be used in the simulation, 
except that excess capacity provided to meet process loads need not be 
modeled unless the process load was not modeled in setting Energy Cost 
Budget. Equipment sizing in the simulation of the Proposed Design shall 
correspond to the equipment actually selected for the design and the 
designer shall not use equipment sized automatically by the simulation 
tool.
    517.6.1 Redundant or emergency equipment need not be simulated if it 
is controlled to not be operated during normal operations of the 
building.

Sec. 434.518  Service water heating.

    518.1 The service water loads for Prototype and Reference Buildings 
are defined in terms of Btu/h per person in Table 518.1.1, Service Hot 
Water Quantities. The service water heating loads from Table 518.1.1 are 
prescribed assumptions for multi-family high-rise residential buildings 
and default assumptions for all other buildings. The same service water 
heating load assumptions shall be made in calculating Design Energy 
Consumption as were used in calculating the Energy Cost Budget.

  multipliers of the Building Profile Schedules in Table 513.2.b. See
  Table 513.2.a for occupancy levels.
\2\ Total hot water use per dwelling unit for each hour shall be 3,400
  Btu/h times the multi-family high rise residential building SWH system
  multiplier from Table 513.2.b.

    518.2 The service water heating system, including piping losses for 
the Prototype Building, shall be modeled using the methods of the RS-47 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 434.701) using a system that meets 
all requirements of subsection 404. The service water heating equipment 
for the Prototype or Reference Building shall be either an electric heat 
pump or natural gas, or if natural gas is not available at the site, 
<greek-i>2 fuel oil. Exception: If electric resistance service water 
heating is preferable to an electric heat pump when analyzed according 
to the criteria of Sec. 434.404.1.4 or when service water temperatures 
exceeding 145[deg]F are required for a particular application, electric 
resistance water heating may be used.


<R05>
Sec. 434.519  Controls.

    519.1 All occupied conditioned spaces in the Prototype, Reference 
and

[[Page 531]]

Proposed Design Buildings in all climates shall be simulated as being 
both heated and cooled. The assumptions in this subsection are 
prescribed assumptions. If the Proposed Design does not include 
equipment for cooling or heating, the Design Energy Consumption shall be 
determined by the specifications for calculating the Energy Cost Budget 
as described in Table 517.4.1 HVAC System Description for Prototype and 
Reference Buildings. Exceptions to 519.1 are as follows:
    519.1.1 If a building is to be provided with only heating or 
cooling, both the Prototype or Reference Building and the Proposed 
Design shall be simulated, using the same assumptions. Such an 
assumption cannot be made unless the building interior temperature meets 
the comfort criteria of RS-2 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 
434.701) at least 98% of the occupied hours during the year.
    519.1.2 If warehouses are not intended to be mechanically cooled, 
both the Energy Cost Budget and Design Energy Consumption shall be 
modeled assuming no mechanical cooling; and
    519.1.3 In climates where winter design temperature (97.5% 
occurrence) is greater than 59[deg]F, space heating need not be modeled.
    519.2 Space temperature controls for the Prototype or Reference 
Building, except multi-family high-rise residential buildings, shall be 
set at 70[deg]F for space heating and 75[deg]F for space cooling with a 
deadband per subsection 403.2.6.3. The system shut off during off-hours 
shall be according to the schedule in Table 515.2, except that the 
heating system shall cycle on if any space should drop below the night 
setback setting of 55[deg]F. There shall be no similar setpoint during 
the cooling season. Lesser deadband ranges may be used in calculating 
the Design Energy Consumption. Exceptions to 519.2 are as follows:
    (a) Setback shall not be modeled in determining either the Energy 
Cost Budget or Design Energy Cost if setback is not realistic for the 
Proposed Design, such as 24-hour/day operations. Health facilities need 
not have night setback during the heating season; and
    (b) Hotel/motels and multi-family high-rise residential buildings 
shall have a night setback temperature of 60 [deg]F from 11:00 p.m. to 
6:00 a.m. during the heating season; and
    (c) If deadband controls are not to be installed, the Design Energy 
Cost shall be calculated with both heating and cooling thermostat 
setpoints set to the same value between 70 [deg]F and 75 [deg]F 
inclusive, assumed to be constant for the year.
    519.2.1 For multi-family buildings, the thermostat schedule for the 
dwelling units shall be as in Table 519.1.2, Thermostat Settings for 
Multi-Family High-rise Buildings. The Prototype Building shall use the 
single zone schedule. The Proposed Design shall use the two-zone 
schedule only if zonal thermostatic controls are provided. For Proposed 
Designs that use heat pumps employing supplementary heat, the controls 
used to switch on the auxiliary heat source during morning warm-up 
periods shall be simulated accurately. The thermostat assumptions for 
multi-family high-rise buildings are prescribed assumptions.
    519.3 When providing for outdoor air ventilation in calculating the 
Energy Cost Budget, controls shall be assumed to close the outside air 
intake to reduce the flow of outside air to 0 cfm during setback and 
unoccupied periods. Ventilation using inside air may still be required 
to maintain scheduled setback temperature. Outside air ventilation, 
during occupied periods, shall be as required by RS-41, (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 434.701) or the Proposed Design, whichever is 
greater.
    519.4 If humidification is to be used in the Proposed Design, the 
same level of humidification and system type shall be used in the 
Prototype or Reference Building. If dehumidification requires subcooling 
of supply air, then reheat for the Prototype or Reference Building shall 
be from recovered waste heat such as condenser waste heat.

Sec. 434.520  Speculative buildings.

    520.1 Lighting. The interior lighting power allowance (ILPA) for 
calculating the Energy Cost Budget shall be determined from Table 
401.3.2a. The Design Energy Consumption may be based on an assumed 
adjusted lighting power for future lighting improvements.
    520.2 The assumption about future lighting power used to calculate 
the Design Energy Consumption must be documented so that the future 
installed lighting systems may be in compliance with these standards. 
Documentation must be provided to enable future lighting systems to use 
either the Prescriptive method or the Systems Performance method of 
subsection 401.3.
    520.3 Documentation for future lighting systems that use subsection 
401.3 shall be stated as a maximum adjusted lighting power for the 
tenant spaces. The adjusted lighting power allowance for tenant spaces 
shall account for the lighting power provided for the common areas of 
the building.
    520.4 Documentation for future lighting systems that use subsection 
401.3 shall be stated as a required lighting adjustment. The required 
lighting adjustment is the whole building lighting power assumed in 
order to calculate the Design Energy Consumption minus the ILPA value 
from Table 401.3.2c that was used to calculate the Energy Cost Budget. 
When the required lighting adjustment is less than zero, a complete 
lighting design must be developed for one or more representative tenant 
spaces, demonstrating acceptable lighting within the limits of the 
assumed lighting power allowance.
    520.5 HVAC Systems and Equipment. If the HVAC system is not 
completely specified in the plans, the Design Energy Consumption shall 
be based on reasonable assumptions about the construction of future HVAC 
systems and equipment. These assumptions shall be documented so that 
future HVAC systems and equipment may be in compliance with these 
standards.


<R05>
Sec. 434.521  The simulation tool.

    521.1 Annual energy consumption shall be simulated with a multi-
zone, 8760 hours per year building energy model. The model shall account 
for:
    521.1.1 The dynamic heat transfer of the building envelope such as 
solar and internal gains;
    521.1.2 Equipment efficiencies as a function of load and climate;
    521.1.3 Lighting and HVAC system controls and distribution systems 
by simulating the whole building;
    521.1.4 The operating schedule of the building including night 
setback during various times of the year; and
    521.1.5 Energy consumption information at a level necessary to 
determine the Energy Cost Budget and Design Energy Cost through the 
appropriate utility rate schedules.
    521.1.6 While the simulation tool should simulate an entire year on 
an hour by hour basis (8760 hours), programs that approximate this 
dynamic analysis procedure and provide equivalent results are 
acceptable.
    521.1.7 Simulation tools shall be selected for their ability to 
simulate accurately the relevant features of the building in question, 
as shown in the tool's documentation. For example, a single-zone model 
shall not be used to simulate a large, multi-zone building, and a 
steady-state model such as the degree-day method shall not be used to 
simulate buildings when equipment efficiency or performance is 
significantly

[[Page 533]]

affected by the dynamic patterns of weather, solar radiation, and 
occupancy. Relevant energy-related features shall be addressed by a 
model such as daylighting, atriums or sunspaces, night ventilation or 
thermal storage, chilled water storage or heat recovery, active or 
passive solar systems, zoning and controls of heating and cooling 
systems, and ground-coupled buildings. In addition, models shall be 
capable of translating the Design Energy Consumption into energy cost 
using actual utility rate schedules with the coincidental electrical 
demand of a building. Examples of public domain models capable of 
handling such complex building systems and energy cost translations 
available in the United States are DOE--2.1C and BLAST 3.0 and in 
Canada, Energy Systems Analysis Series.
    521.1.8 All simulation tools shall use scientifically justifiable 
documented techniques and procedures for modeling building loads, 
systems, and equipment. The algorithms used in the program shall have 
been verified by comparison with experimental measurements, loads, 
systems, and equipment.

            Subpart F_Building Energy Compliance Alternative


<R05>
Sec. 434.601  General.

    601.1 This subpart provides an alternative path for compliance with 
the standards that allow for greater flexibility in the design of energy 
efficient buildings using an annual energy use method. This path 
provides an opportunity for the use of innovative designs, materials, 
and equipment such as daylighting, passive solar heating, and heat 
recovery, that may not be adequately evaluated by methods found in 
Subpart D.
    601.2 The Building Energy Compliance Alternative shall be used with 
subpart C and subpart D, 401.1, 401.2, 401.3.4 and in conjunction with 
the minimum requirements found in subsections 402.1, 402.2, and 402.3., 
403.1, 403.2.1-7, 403.2.9 and 404.
    601.3 Compliance under this section is demonstrated by showing that 
the calculated annual energy usage for the Proposed Design is less than 
or equal to a calculated Energy Use Budget. (See Figure 601.3, Building 
Energy Compliance Alternative). The analytical procedures in this 
subpart are only for determining design compliance, and are not to be 
used either to predict, document or verify annual energy consumption.

[[Page 534]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.017

    601.4 Compliance under the Building Energy Use Budget method 
requires a detailed energy analysis, using a conventional simulation 
tool, of the Proposed Design. A life cycle cost analysis shall be used 
to select the fuel source for the HVAC systems, service hot water, and 
process loads from available alternatives. The Annual Energy Consumption 
of the Proposed Design with the life cycle cost-effective fuel selection 
is calculated to determine the modeled energy consumption, called the 
Design Energy Use.
    601.5 The Design Energy Use is defined as the energy that is 
consumed within the five foot line of a proposed building per ft\2\ over 
a 24-hour day, 365-

[[Page 535]]

day year period and specified operating hours. The calculated Design 
Energy Use is then compared to a calculated Energy Use Budget.
    601.6 Compliance. The Energy Use Budget is determined by calculating 
the annual energy usage for a Reference or Prototype Building that is 
configured to comply with the provisions of Subpart E for such 
buildings, except that the fuel source(s) of the Prototype or Reference 
Building shall be the same life cycle cost-effective source(s) selected 
for the Proposed Design. If the Design Energy Use is less than or equal 
to the Energy Use Budget then the proposed design complies with these 
standards.
    601.7 This section provides instructions for determining the Design 
Energy Use and for calculating the Energy Use Budget. The Energy Use 
Budget is the highest allowable calculated annual energy consumption for 
a specified building design. Designers are encouraged to design 
buildings whose Design Energy Use is lower than the Energy Use Budget.


<R05>
Sec. 434.602  Determination of the annual energy budget.

    602.1 The Energy Use Budget shall be calculated for the appropriate 
Prototype or Reference Building in accordance with the procedures 
prescribed in subsection 502 with the following exceptions: The Energy 
Use Budget shall be stated in units of Btu/ft\2\/yr and the simulation 
tool shall segregate the calculated energy consumption by fuel type 
producing an Energy Use Budget for each fuel (the fuel selections having

Sec. 434.603  Determination of the design energy use.

    603.1 The Design Energy Use shall be calculated by modeling the 
Proposed Design using the same methods, assumptions, climate data, and 
simulation tool as were used to establish the Energy Use Budget, but 
with the design features that will be used in the final building design. 
The simulation tool used shall segregate the calculated energy 
consumption by fuel type giving an annual Design Energy Use for each 
fuel. The sum of the Design Energy Uses multiplied by the fuel 
conversion factors in Table 602.2 yields the Design Energy Use for the 
proposed design:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.030

    Where f<INF>1</INF>, f<INF>2</INF>, * * * f<INF>i</INF> are the fuel 
conversion factors in Table 602.2.
    603.2 Required Life Cycle Cost Analysis for Fuel Selection.
    603.2.1 Fuel sources selected for the Proposed Design and Prototype 
or Reference buildings shall be determined by considering the energy 
cost and other costs and cost savings that occur during the expected 
economic life of the alternative.
    603.2.2 The designer shall use the procedures set forth in subpart A 
of 10 CFR part 436 to make this determination. The fuel selection life 
cycle cost analysis shall include the following steps:
    603.2.2.1 Determine the feasible alternatives for energy sources of 
the Proposed Design's HVAC systems, service hot water, and process 
loads.
    603.2.2.2 Model the Proposed Design including the alternative HVAC 
and service water systems and conduct an annual energy analysis for each 
fuel source alternative using the simulation tool specified in this 
section. The annual energy analysis shall be computed on a monthly basis 
in conformance with subpart E with the exception that all process loads 
shall be included in the calculation. Separate the output of the 
analysis by fuel type.
    603.2.2.3 Determine the unit price of each fuel using information 
from the utility or other reliable local source. During rapid changes in 
fuel prices it is recommended that an average fuel price for the 
previous twelve months be used in lieu of the current price. Calculate 
the annual energy cost of each energy source alternative in accordance 
with procedures in subpart E for the Design Energy Cost. Estimate the 
initial cost of the HVAC and service water systems and other initial 
costs such as energy distribution lines and service connection fees 
associated with each fuel source alternative. Estimate other costs and 
benefits for each alternative including, but not necessarily limited to, 
annual maintenance and repair, periodic and one time major repairs and 
replacements and salvage of the energy and service water systems. Cost 
estimates shall be prepared using professionally recognized cost 
estimating tools, guides and techniques.
    603.2.2.4 Perform a life cycle cost analysis using the procedure 
specified in subsection 603.2.
    603.2.2.5 Compare the total life cycle cost of each energy source 
alternative. The alternative with the lowest total life cycle cost shall 
be chosen as the energy source for the proposed design.

Sec. 434.604  Compliance.

    604.1 Compliance with this section is demonstrated if the Design 
Energy Use is equal to or less than the Energy Use Budget.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.031

    604.2 The energy consumption shall be measured at the building five 
foot line for all fuels. Energy consumed from non-depletable energy 
sources and heat recovery systems shall not be included in the Design 
Energy Use calculations. The thermal efficiency of fixtures, equipment, 
systems or plants in the proposed design shall be simulated by the 
selected calculation tool.

Sec. 434.605  Standard Calculation Procedure.

    605.1 The Standard Calculation Procedure consists of methods and 
assumptions for calculating the Energy Use Budgets for Prototype and 
Reference Buildings and the Energy Use for the Proposed Design. In order 
to maintain consistency between the Energy Use Budgets and the Design 
Energy Use, the input assumptions stated in subsection 510.2 are to be 
used.
    605.2 The terms Energy Cost Budget and Design Energy Cost or Design 
Energy Consumption used in subpart E of this part correlate to Energy 
Use Budget and Design Energy Use, respectively, in subpart F of this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 434.606  Simulation tool.

    606.1 The criteria established in subsection 521 for the selection 
of a simulation tool shall be followed when using the compliance path 
prescribed in subpart F of this part.

Sec. 434.607  Life cycle cost analysis criteria.

    607.1 The following life cycle cost criteria applies to the fuel 
selection requirements of this subpart and to option life cycle cost 
analyses performed to evaluate energy conservation design alternatives. 
The fuel source(s) selection shall be made in accordance with the 
requirements of subpart A of 10 CFR part 436. When performing optional 
life cycle cost analyses of energy conservation opportunities the 
designer may use the life cycle cost procedures of subpart A of 10 CFR 
part 436 or OMB Circular 1-94 or an equivalent procedure that meets the 
assumptions listed below:
    607.1.1 The economic life of the Prototype Building and Proposed 
Design shall be 25 years. Anticipated replacements or renovations of 
energy related features and systems in the Prototype or Reference 
Building and Proposed Design during this period shall be included in 
their respective life cycle cost calculations.
    607.1.2 The designer shall follow established professional cost 
estimating practices when determining the costs and benefits associated 
with the energy related features of the Prototype or Reference Building 
and Proposed Design.
    607.1.3 All costs shall be expressed in current dollars. General 
inflation shall be disregarded. Differential escalation of prices 
(prices estimated to rise faster or slower than general inflation) for 
energy used in the life cycle cost calculations shall be those in effect 
at the time of the latest ``Annual Energy Outlook'' (DOE/EIA-0383) as 
published by the Department of Energy's Energy Information 
Administration.
    607.1.4 The economic effects of taxes, depreciation and other 
factors not consistent with the practices of subpart A of 10 CFR part 
436 shall not be included in the life cycle cost calculation.

    Source: 71 FR 70283, Dec. 4, 2006.


<R05>
Sec. 435.1  Purpose and scope.

    This part establishes energy efficiency performance standard for the 
construction of new Federal low-rise residential buildings as required 
by section 305(a) of the Energy Conservation and Production Act, as 
amended (42 U.S.C. 6834(a)).


<R05>
Sec. 435.2  Definitions.

    For purposes of this part, the following terms, phrases and words 
shall be defined as follows:
    Baseline building means a new Federal low-rise residential building 
that is otherwise identical to the proposed building but is designed to 
meet but not exceed the energy efficiency specifications in the ICC 
International Energy Conservation Code, 2004 Supplement Edition, January 
2005 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 435.3).
    DOE means U.S. Department of Energy.
    Federal agency means any department, agency, corporation, or other 
entity or instrumentality of the executive branch of the Federal 
Government, including the United States Postal Service, the Federal 
National Mortgage Association, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corporation.
    ICC means International Code Council.
    IECC means International Energy Conservation Code.
    Life-cycle cost means the total cost related to energy conservation 
measures of owning, operating and maintaining a building over its useful 
life as determined in accordance with 10 CFR part 436.
    Life-cycle cost-effective means that the proposed building has a 
lower life-cycle cost than the life-cycle costs of the baseline 
building, as described by 10 CFR 436.19, or has a positive estimated net 
savings, as described by 10 CFR 436.20, or has a savings-to-investment 
ratio estimated to be greater than one, as described by 10 CFR 436.21; 
or has an adjusted internal rate of return, as described by 10 CFR 
436.22, that is estimated to be greater than the discount rate as listed 
in OMB Circular Number A-94 ``Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit-
Cost Analysis of Federal Programs.''
    Low-rise residential building means any building three stories or 
less in height above grade that includes sleeping accommodations where 
the occupants are primarily permanent in nature (30 days or more).
    New Federal building means any building to be constructed by, or for 
the use

[[Page 541]]

of, any Federal agency which is not legally subject to State or local 
building codes or similar requirements.
    Proposed building means the building design of a new Federal low-
rise residential building proposed for construction.

    Effective Date Note: At 72 FR 72571, Dec. 21, 2007, Sec. 435.2 was 
amended by adding in alphabetical order a definition of ``Design for 
construction'' and revising the definition of ``New Federal building'', 
effective Jan. 22, 2008. For the convenience of the user, the added and 
revised text is set forth as follows:


<R05>
Sec. 435.2  Definitions.

                                * * * * *

    Design for construction means the stage when the energy efficiency 
and sustainability details (such as insulation levels, HVAC systems, 
water-using systems, etc.) are either explicitly determined or 
implicitly included in a project cost specification.

Sec. 436.12  Life cycle cost methodology.

    The life cycle cost methodology for this part is a systematic 
analysis of relevant costs, excluding sunk costs, over a study period, 
relating initial costs to future costs by the technique of discounting 
future costs to present values.


<R05>
Sec. 436.13  Presuming cost-effectiveness results.

    (a) If the investment and other costs for an energy or water 
conservation measure considered for retrofit to an existing Federal 
building or a building energy system or building water system considered 
for incorporation into a new building design are insignificant, a 
Federal agency may presume that such

[[Page 549]]

a system is life cycle cost-effective without further analysis.
    (b) A Federal agency may presume that an investment in an energy or 
water conservation measure retrofit to an existing Federal building is 
not life cycle cost-effective for Federal investment if the Federal 
building is--
    (1) Occupied under a short-term lease with a remaining term of one 
year or less, and without a renewal option or with a renewal option 
which is not likely to be exercised;
    (2) Occupied under a lease which includes the cost of utilities in 
the rent and does not provide a pass-through of energy or water savings 
to the government; or
    (3) Scheduled to be demolished or retired from service within one 
year or less.

Sec. 436.14  Methodological assumptions.

    (a) Each Federal Agency shall discount to present values the future 
cash flows established in either current or constant dollars consistent 
with the nominal or real discount rate, and related tables, published in 
the annual supplement to the Life Cycle Costing Manual for the Federal 
Energy Management Program (NIST 85-3273) and determined annually by DOE 
as follows--
    (1) The nominal discount rate shall be a 12 month average of the 
composite yields of all outstanding U.S. Treasury bonds neither due nor 
callable in less than ten years, as most recently reported by the 
Federal Reserve Board; and
    (2) Subject to a ceiling of 10 percent and a floor of three percent 
the real discount rate shall be a 12 month average of the composite 
yields of all outstanding U.S. Treasury bonds neither due nor callable 
in less than ten years, as most recently reported by the Federal Reserve 
Board, adjusted to exclude estimated increases in the general level of 
prices consistent with projections of inflation in the most recent 
Economic Report of the President's Council of Economic Advisors.
    (b) Each Federal agency shall assume that energy prices will change 
at rates projected by DOE's Energy Information Administration and 
published by NIST annually no later than the beginning of the fiscal 
year in the Annual Supplement to the Life Cycle Costing Manual for the 
Federal Energy Management Program, in tables consistent with the 
discount rate determined by DOE under paragraph (a) of this section, 
except that--
    (1) If the Federal agency is using component prices under Sec. 
436.14(c), that agency may use corresponding component escalation rates 
provided by the energy or water supplier.
    (2) For Federal buildings in foreign countries, the Federal agency 
may use a ``reasonable'' escalation rate.
    (c) Each Federal agency shall assume that the price of energy or 
water in the base year is the actual price charged for energy or water 
delivered to the Federal building and may use actual component prices as 
provided by the energy or water supplier.
    (d) Each Federal agency shall assume that the appropriate study 
period is as follows:
    (1) For evaluating and ranking alternative retrofits for an existing 
Federal building, the study period is the expected life of the retrofit, 
or 25 years from the beginning of beneficial use, whichever is shorter.
    (2) For determining the life cycle costs or net savings of mutually 
exclusive alternatives for a given building energy system or building 
water system (e.g., alternative designs for a particular system or size 
of a new or retrofit building energy system or building water system), a 
uniform study period for all alternatives shall be assumed which is 
equal to--
    (i) The estimated life of the mutually exclusive alternative having 
the longest life, not to exceed 25 years from the beginning of 
beneficial use with appropriate replacement and salvage values for each 
of the other alternatives; or
    (ii) The lowest common multiple of the expected lives of the 
alternative, not to exceed 25 from the beginning of beneficial use with 
appropriate replacement and salvage values for each alternative.
    (3) For evaluating alternative designs for a new Federal building, 
the study period extends from the base year

[[Page 550]]

through the expected life of the building or 25 years from the beginning 
of beneficial use, whichever is shorter.
    (e) Each Federal agency shall assume that the expected life of any 
building energy system or building water system is the period of service 
without major renewal or overhaul, as estimated by a qualified engineer 
or architect, as appropriate, or any other reliable source except that 
the period of service of a building energy or water system shall not be 
deemed to exceed the expected life of the owned building, or the 
effective remaining term of the leased building (taking into account 
renewal options likely to be exercised).
    (f) Each Federal agency may assume that investment costs are a lump 
sum occurring at the beginning of the base year, or may discount future 
investment costs to present value using the appropriate present worth 
factors under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (g) Each Federal agency may assume that energy or water costs and 
non-fuel or non-water operation and maintenance costs begin to accrue at 
the beginning of the base year or when actually projected to occur.
    (h) Each Federal agency may assume that costs occur in a lump sum at 
any time within the year in which they are incurred.
    (i) This section shall not apply to calculations of estimated simple 
payback time under Sec. 436.22 of this part.

Sec. 436.15  Formatting cost data.

    In establishing cost data under Sec. Sec. 436.16 and 436.17 and 
measuring cost effectiveness by the modes of analysis described by Sec. 
436.19 through Sec. 436.22, a format for accomplishing the analysis 
which includes all required input data and assumptions shall be used. 
Subject to Sec. 436.18(b), Federal agencies are encouraged to use 
worksheets or computer software referenced in the Life Cycle Cost Manual 
for the Federal Energy Management Program.


<R05>
Sec. 436.16  Establishing non-fuel and non-water cost categories.

    (a) The relevant non-fuel cost categories are--
    (1) Investment costs;
    (2) Non-fuel operation and maintenance cost;
    (3) Replacement cost; and
    (4) Salvage value.
    (b) The relevant non-water cost categories are--
    (1) Investment costs;
    (2) Non-water operation and maintenance cost;
    (3) Replacement cost; and
    (4) Salvage value.
    (c) The present value of recurring costs is the product of the base 
year value of recurring costs as multiplied by the appropriate uniform 
present worth factor under Sec. 436.14, or as calculated by computer 
software indicated in Sec. 436.18(b) and used with the official 
discount rate and escalation rate assumptions under Sec. 436.14. When 
recurring costs begin to accrue at a later time, subtract the present 
value of recurring costs over the delay, calculated using the 
appropriate uniform present worth factor for the period of the delay, 
from the present value of recurring costs over the study period or, if 
using computer software, indicate a delayed beneficial occupancy date.
    (d) The present value of non-recurring cost under Sec. 436.16(a) is 
the product of the non-recurring costs as multiplied by appropriate 
single present worth factors under Sec. 436.14 for the respective years 
in which the costs are expected to be incurred, or as calculated by 
computer software provided or approved by DOE and used with the official 
discount rate and escalation rate assumptions under Sec. 436.14.

<R05>
Sec. 436.17  Establishing energy or water cost data.

    (a) Each Federal agency shall establish energy costs in the base 
year by multiplying the total units of energy used in the base year by 
the price per unit of energy in the base year as determined in 
accordance with Sec. 436.14(c).
    (b) When energy costs begin to accrue in the base year, the present 
value of energy costs over the study period is the product of energy 
costs in the base year as established under Sec. 436.17(a), multiplied 
by the appropriate modified uniform present worth factor adjusted

[[Page 551]]

for energy price escalation for the applicable region, sector, fuel 
type, and study period consistent with Sec. 436.14, or as calculated by 
computer software provided or approved by DOE and used with the official 
discount rate and escalation rate assumptions under Sec. 436.14. When 
energy costs begin to accrue at a later time, subtract the present value 
of energy costs over the delay, calculated using the adjusted, modified 
uniform present worth factor for the period of delay, from the present 
value of energy costs over the study period or, if using computer 
software, indicate a delayed beneficial occupancy date.
    (c) Each Federal agency shall establish water costs in the base year 
by multiplying the total units of water used in the base year by the 
price per unit of water in the base year as determined in accordance 
with Sec. 436.14(c).
    (d) When water costs begin to accrue in the base year, the present 
value of water costs over the study period is the product of water costs 
in the base year as established under Sec. 436.17(a), or as calculated 
by computer software provided or approved by DOE and used with the 
official discount rate and assumptions under Sec. 436.14. When water 
costs begin to accrue at a later time, subtract the present value of 
water costs over the delay, calculated using the uniform present worth 
factor for the period of delay, from the present value of water costs 
over the study period or, if using computer software, indicate a delayed 
beneficial occupancy date.

<R05>
Sec. 436.18  Measuring cost-effectiveness.

    (a) In accordance with this section, each Federal agency shall 
measure cost-effectiveness by combining cost data established under 
Sec. Sec. 436.16 and 436.17 in the appropriate mode of analysis as 
described in Sec. 436.19 through Sec. 436.22.
    (b) Federal agencies performing LCC analysis on computers shall use 
either the Federal Buildings Life Cycle Costing (FBLCC) software 
provided by DOE or software consistent with this subpart.
    (c) Replacement of a building energy or water system with an energy 
or water conservation measure by retrofit to an existing Federal 
building or by substitution in the design for a new Federal building 
shall be deemed cost-effective if--
    (1) Life cycle costs, as described by Sec. 436.19, are estimated to 
be lower; or
    (2) Net savings, as described by Sec. 436.20, are estimated to be 
positive; or
    (3) The savings-to-investment ratio, as described by Sec. 436.21, 
is estimated to be greater than one; or
    (4) The adjusted internal rate of return, as described by Sec. 
436.22, is estimated to be greater than the discount rate as set by DOE.
    (d) As a rough measure, each Federal agency may determine estimated 
simple payback time under Sec. 436.23, which indicates whether a 
retrofit is likely to be cost effective under one of the four 
calculation methods referenced in Sec. 436.18(c). An energy or water 
conservation measure alternative is likely to be cost-effective if 
estimated payback time is significantly less than the useful life of 
that system, and of the Federal building in which it is to be installed.
    (e) Mutually exclusive alternatives for a given building energy or 
water system, considered in determining such matters as the optimal size 
of a solar energy system, the optimal thickness of insulation, or the 
best choice of double-glazing or triple-glazing for windows, shall be 
compared and evaluated on the basis of life cycle costs or net savings 
over equivalent study periods. The alternative which is estimated to 
result in the lowest life cycle costs or the highest net savings shall 
be deemed the most cost-effective because it tends to minimize the life 
cycle cost of Federal building.
    (f) When available appropriations will not permit all cost-effective 
energy or water conservation measures to be undertaken, they shall be 
ranked in descending order of their savings-to-investment ratios, or 
their adjusted internal rate of return, to establish priority. If 
available appropriations cannot be fully exhausted for a fiscal year by 
taking all budgeted energy or water conservation measures according to 
their rank, the set of energy or water

[[Page 552]]

conservation measures that will maximize net savings for available 
appropriations should be selected.
    (g) Alternative building designs for new Federal buildings shall be 
evaluated on the basis of life cycle costs. The alternative design which 
results in the lowest life cycle costs for a given new building shall be 
deemed the most cost-effective.

Sec. 436.19  Life cycle costs.

    Life cycle costs are the sum of the present values of--
    (a) Investment costs, less salvage values at the end of the study 
period;
    (b) Non-fuel operation and maintenance costs:
    (c) Replacement costs less salvage costs of replaced building 
systems; and

Sec. 436.20  Net savings.

    For a retrofit project, net savings may be found by subtracting life 
cycle costs based on the proposed project from life cycle costs based on 
not having it. For a new building design, net savings is the difference 
between the life cycle costs of an alternative design and the life cycle 
costs of the basic design.

Sec. 436.21  Savings-to-investment ratio.

    The savings-to-investment ratio is the ratio of the present value 
savings to the present value costs of an energy or water conservation 
measure. The numerator of the ratio is the present value of net savings 
in energy or water and non-fuel or non-water operation and maintenance 
costs attributable to the proposed energy or water conservation measure. 
The denominator of the ratio is the present value of the net increase in 
investment and replacement costs less salvage value attributable to the 
proposed energy or water conservation measure.

<R05>
Sec. 436.22  Adjusted internal rate of return.

    The adjusted internal rate of return is the overall rate of return 
on an energy or water conservation measure. It is calculated by 
subtracting 1 from the nth root of the ratio of the terminal value of 
savings to the present value of costs, where n is the number of years in 
the study period. The numerator of the ratio is calculated by using the 
discount rate to compound forward to the end of the study period the 
yearly net savings in energy or water and non-fuel or non-water 
operation and maintenance costs attributable to the proposed energy or 
water conservation measure. The denominator of the ratio is the present 
value of the net increase in investment and replacement costs less 
salvage value attributable to the proposed energy or water conservation 
measure.

building energy or water system, without consideration of discount 
rates.

Sec. 436.24  Uncertainty analyses.

    If particular items of cost data or timing of cash flows are 
uncertain and are not fixed under Sec. 436.14, Federal agencies may 
examine the impact of uncertainty on the calculation of life cycle cost 
effectiveness or the assignment of rank order by conducting additional 
analyses using any standard engineering economics method such as 
sensitivity and probabilistic analysis. If additional analysis casts 
substantial doubt on the life cycle cost analysis results, a Federal 
agency should consider obtaining more reliable data or eliminating the 
building energy or water system alternative.

qualifications and requiring listed firms to update their statements of 
qualifications for changes in the information previously provided.
    (b) On the basis of statements of qualifications received under 
paragraph (a) of this section and any other relevant information, DOE 
shall select a firm for inclusion on the qualified list if--
    (1) It has provided energy savings performance contract services or 
services that save energy or reduce utility costs for not less than two 
clients, and the firm possesses the appropriate project experience to 
successfully implement the technologies which it proposes to provide;
    (2) Previous project clients provide ratings which are ``fair'' or 
better;
    (3) The firm or any principal of the firm has neither been insolvent 
nor declared bankruptcy within the last five years;
    (4) The firm or any principal of the firm is not on the list of

performance contracts.
    (c) DOE may remove a firm from DOE's list of qualified contractors 
after notice and an opportunity for comment if--
    (1) There is a failure to update its statement of qualifications;
    (2) There is credible information warranting disqualification; or
    (3) There is other good cause.

[[Page 555]]

Sec. 436.33  Procedures and methods for contractor selection.

    (a) Competitive selection. Competitive selections based on 
solicitation of firms are subject to the following procedures--
    (1) With respect to a particular proposed energy cost savings 
performance project, Federal agencies shall publish a Commerce Business 
Daily notice which synopsizes the proposed contract action.
    (2) Each competitive solicitation--
    (i) Shall request technical and price proposals and the text of any 
third-party financing agreement from interested firms;
    (ii) Shall consider DOE model solicitations and should use them to 
the maximum extent practicable;
    (iii) May provide for a two-step selection process which allows 
Federal agencies to make an initial selection based, in part, on 
proposals containing estimated energy cost savings and energy unit 
savings, with contract award conditioned on confirmation through a 
detailed energy survey that the guaranteed energy cost savings are 
within a certain percentage (specified in the solicitation) of the 
estimated amount; and
    (iv) May state that if the Federal agency requires a detailed energy 
survey which identifies life cycle cost effective energy conservation 
measures not in the initial proposal, the contract may include such 
measures.
    (3) Based on its evaluation of the technical and price proposals 
submitted, any applicable financing agreement (including lease-
acquisitions, if any), statements of qualifications submitted under 
Sec. 436.32 of this subpart, and any other information determines to be 
relevant, the Federal agency may select a firm on a qualified list to 
conduct the project.
    (4) If a proposed energy cost savings project involves a large 
facility with too many contiguously related buildings and other 
structures at one site for proposing firms to assume the costs of a 
preliminary energy survey of all such structures, the Federal agency--
    (i) May request technical and price proposals for a representative 
sample of buildings and other structures and may select a firm to 
conduct the proposed project; and
    (ii) After selection of a firm, but prior to award of an energy 
savings performance contract, may request the selected firm to submit 
technical and price proposals for all or some of the remaining buildings 
and other structures at the site and may include in the award for all or 
some of the remaining buildings and other structures.
    (5) After selection under paragraph (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this 
section, but prior to award, a Federal agency may require the selectee 
to conduct a detailed energy survey to confirm that guaranteed energy 
cost savings are within a certain percentage (specified in the 
solicitation) of estimated energy cost savings in the selectee's 
proposal. If the detailed energy survey does not confirm that guaranteed 
energy savings are within the fixed percentage of estimated savings, the 
Federal agency may select another firm from those within the competitive 
range.
    (b) Unsolicited proposals. Federal agencies may--
    (1) Consider unsolicited energy savings performance contract 
proposals from firms on a qualified contractor list under this subpart 
which include technical and price proposals and the text of any 
financing agreement (including a lease-acquisition) without regard to 
the requirements of 48 CFR 15.602 and 15.602-2(a)(1); 48 CFR 15.603; and 
48 CFR 15.607(a), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4) and (a)(5).

[[Page 556]]

    (2) Reject an unsolicited proposal that is too narrow because it 
does not address the potential for significant energy conservation 
measures from other than those measures in the proposal.
    (3) After requiring a detailed energy survey, if appropriate, and 
determining that technical and price proposals are adequate, award a 
contract to a firm on a qualified contractor list under this subpart on 
the basis of an unsolicited proposal, provided that the Federal agency 
complies with the following procedures--
    (i) An award may not be made to the firm submitting the unsolicited 
proposal unless the Federal agency first publishes a notice in the 
Commerce Business Daily acknowledging receipt of the proposal and 
inviting other firms on the qualified list to submit competing 
proposals.
    (ii) Except for unsolicited proposals submitted in response to a 
published general statement of agency needs, no award based on such an 
unsolicited proposal may be made in instances in which the Federal 
agency is planning the acquisition of an energy conservation measure 
through an energy savings performance contract.
    (c) Certified cost or pricing data. (1) Energy savings performance 
contracts under this part are firm fixed-price contracts.
    (2) Pursuant to the authority provided under section 304A(b)(1)(B) 
of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1049, the 
heads of procuring activities shall waive the requirement for submission 
of certified cost or pricing data. However, this does not exempt 
offerors from submitting information (including pricing information) 
required by the Federal agency to ensure the impartial and comprehensive 
evaluation of proposals.

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of this subpart is to provide guidelines 
for use by Federal agencies in their development of overall 10-year 
energy management plans to establish energy conservation goals, to 
reduce the rate of energy consumption, to promote the efficient use of 
energy, to promote switching for petroleum-based fuels and natural gas 
to coal and other energy sources, to provide a methodology for reporting 
their progress in meeting the goals of those plans, and to promote 
emergency energy conservation planning to assuage the impact of a sudden 
disruption in the supply of oil-based fuels, natural gas or electricity. 
The plan is intended to provide the cornerstone for a program to 
conserve energy in the general operations of an agency.
    (b) Scope. This subpart applies to all general operations of Federal 
agencies and is applicable to management of all energy used by Federal 
agencies that is excluded from coverage pursuant to section 543(a)(2) of 
part 3 of title V of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, as 
amended (42 U.S.C. 8251-8261).

Sec. 436.103  Program goal setting.

    (a) In developing and revising plans for a projected 10-year plan 
each agency shall establish and maintain energy conservation goals in 
accordance with the requirements of this section.
    (b) Agencies shall establish three types of conservation goals:
    (1) Energy consumption goals, by fuel type by functional category 
(see appendix B).
    (2) Energy efficiency goals by fuel type by functional category (see 
appendix B).
    (3) Fuel switching goals for shifting energy use from oil and 
natural gas to other fuels in more plentiful supply from domestic 
sources (see appendix B).
    (c) General operations energy conservation goals shall be 
established by each Federal agency with the broad purpose of achieving 
reductions in total energy consumption and increased efficiency without 
serious mission degradation or unmitigated negative environmental 
impacts. Within the broad framework, each agency should seek first to 
reduce energy consumption per unit of output in each applicable 
functional category. In evaluating energy efficiency, each agency should 
select and use standards of measurement which are consistent throughout 
the planning period. Particular attention should be given to increased 
energy use efficiency in nonrenewable fuel consumption. The second focus 
of attention should be on initiatives which shift energy use from oil 
and natural gas to other fuels in more plentiful supply from domestic 
sources.


<R05>
Sec. 436.104  Energy conservation measures and standards.

    (a) Each agency shall consider for inclusion in its plan the 
measures identified in appendix C of this subpart.
    (b) The following questions should be considered in the evaluation 
of each measure:
    (1) Does this measure provide an incentive or disincentive?
    (2) What is the estimate of savings by fuel type?
    (3) What are the direct and indirect impacts of this measure?
    (4) Is this measure to be mandatory throughout the agency?
    (5) If not mandatory, under what circumstances will it be 
implemented, and who will be responsible for determining specific 
applicability?

this measure?
    (7) What incentives (if any) are to be provided for the 
participants?
    (8) When will this measure be implemented?
    (9) Will this measure be implemented in a single step or will it be 
phased in? If it will be phased in, over what period of time?
    (10) Will performance of the measure be evaluated and reported?

[[Page 562]]

    (11) By what criterion will performance be determined?
    (12) Who will prepare performance reports?
    (13) What is the reporting chain?
    (14) What is the reporting period?
    (c) Each agency will take all necessary steps to implement the 
energy conservation standards for general operations listed in appendix 
A (reserved).


<R05>
Sec. 436.105  Emergency conservation plan.

    (a) Each agency shall establish an emergency conservation plan, a 
summary of which shall be included in the general operations plan, for 
assuaging the impact of a sudden disruption in the supply of oil-based 
fuels, natural gas or electricity. Priorities for temporarily reducing 
missions, production, services, and other programmatic or functional 
activities shall be developed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section. Planning for emergencies is to address both buildings and 
general operations. Provisions shall be made for testing emergency 
actions to ascertain that they are effective.
    (b) Federal agencies shall prepare emergency conservation plans for 
10 percent, fifteen percent, and 20 percent reduction compared to the 
previous fiscal year in gasoline, other oil-based fuels, natural gas, or 
electricity for periods of up to 12 months. In developing these plans, 
agencies shall consider the potential for emergency reductions in energy 
use in buildings and facilities which the agency owns, leases, or has 
under contract and by employees through increased use of car and van 
pooling, preferential parking for multipassenger vehicles, and greater 
use of mass transit. Agencies may formulate whatever additional 
scenarios they consider necessary to plan for various energy 
emergencies.
    (c) In general, Federal agencies' priorities shall go to those 
activities which directly support the agencies' primary missions. 
Secondary mission activities which must be curtailed or deferred will be 
reported to DOE as mission impacts. The description of mission impacts 
shall include estimates of the associated resources and time required to 
mitigate the effects of the reduction in energy. Other factors or 
assumptions to be used in energy conservation emergency planning are as 
follows:
    (1) Agencies will be given 15-30 days notice to implement any given 
plan.
    (2) Substitution of fuels in plentiful supply for fuels in short 
supply is authorized, if the substitution can be completed within a 3-
month period and the cost is within the approval authority of the 
executive branch.
    (3) All costs and increases in manpower or other resources 
associated with activities or projects to assuage mission impacts will 
be clearly defined in respective agency plans. One-time costs will be 
identified separately.
    (4) Confronting the emergency situation will be considered a 
priority effort and all projects and increases in operating budgets 
within the approval authority of the executive branch will be 
expeditiously considered and approved if justified.
    (d) Summary plans for agency-wide emergency conservation management 
shall be provided to DOE pursuant to Sec. 436.102(b)(2)(vi). Such 
summaries shall include:
    (1) Agency-wide impacts of energy reductions as determined in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Actions to be taken agency-wide to alleviate the energy 
shortfalls as they occur.
    (3) An assessment of agency services or production that may need to 
be curtailed or limited after corrective actions have been taken.
    (4) A summation of control and feedback mechanisms for managing an 
energy emergency situation.


<R05>
Sec. 436.106  Reporting requirements.

    (a) By July 1 of each year each Federal agency shall submit an 
``Annual Report on Energy Management'' based on fiscal year data to the 
Secretary of DOE. The general operations portion of this report will 
encompass all agency energy use not reported in the buildings portion 
and shall include:
    (1) A summary evaluation of progress toward the achievement of 
energy consumption, energy efficiency, and fuel switching goals 
established by the agency in its plans;

[[Page 563]]

    (2) Energy consumption reported by functional categories. Reports 
must include General Transportation and one or more of the following 
functional categories: industrial or production, services, operational 
training and readiness, and other. Agencies may report in subcategories

 Sec. Appendix A to Part 436--Energy Conservation Standards for General 
                          Operations [Reserved]


<R05>
          Sec. Appendix B to Part 436--Goal Setting Methodology

    In establishing and updating agency goals for energy conservation, 
the following methodology or an equivalent method should be utilized:
    (a) For overall energy consumption--
    (1) An analysis shall be made to determine what factors have the 
most significant impact upon the amount of each fuel type used by the 
agency in performing functions in support of its overall mission. 
Consideration is to be given, but not limited to, the following factors: 
Number of people using energy; number of vehicles using gasoline; 
amounts of other equipment using energy; tempo of operations (one, two, 
or three shifts); the type of operations (degree of equipment or labor 
intensity); equipment fuel limitations; environmental conditions 
(tropical versus arctic, etc.); budget levels for fuel, operations, 
maintenance, and equipment acquisition; and phase-out schedule (of older 
equipment or plants which may be inefficient). After identifying these 
factors, a further analysis shall be made to identify any projected 
workload changes in the quality or quantity of these factors on a yearly 
basis up to 1990.
    (2) Based upon the analysis in (a)(1) and an evaluation of available 
information on past energy usage, a baseline of energy use by fuel type 
by functional category shall be established beginning with FY 1975. In 
addition to ``General Transportation,'' other functional categories 
should be selected to enhance energy management. Total fuel use for a 
particular activity may be allocated to the functional category for 
which the preponderance of fuel is used. Figure B-1 is an example of one 
such baseline.

[[Page 565]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.241

    This example shows an increase in energy use, for a specific fuel 
type, during the period 1975-1981, with a further increase from 1981 to 
1984 and a leveling off and no growth from 1984-1990. A justification, 
based on factors as discussed above, shall accompany each baseline.
    (3) Thereafter, analyses should be made of the measures available 
for reducing the energy consumption profiles without adverse impact on 
mission accomplishment. Finding viable opportunities for reducing energy 
use, increasing energy efficiency and switching energy sources, will 
require consultation with specialists in the fields of operations, 
maintenance, engineering, design, and economics, and consideration of 
the measures identified in Appendix C. The DOE Federal Energy Management 
Programs Office can, upon request, provide information on where such 
resources can be located. Once these measures are identified, they are 
to be incorporated into a time-phased investment program, (using where 
appropriate, the life cycle costing factors and methodology in subpart A 
of this part). If investment and other costs for implementing a measure 
are insignificant, a Federal agency may presume that a measure is cost-
effective without further analysis. An estimate must then be made as to 
the lead time required to implement the program and realize energy 
reductions.
    Figure B-2 shows a summarized investment program, which should be 
accompanied by a detailed description of the measures, projects, and 
programs making up the total planned investments for each year. This 
summary need not be by function or fuel type.

[[Page 566]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.242

    These analyses should enable the agency to project an energy 
consumption goal, with the assumption that funds for executing the 
planned projects will be approved. Figure B-3 shows a new energy use 
profile, with planned initiatives and related investments taken into 
consideration, and the resulting goal entitled ``Energy Use With A 
Plan'' superimposed on Figure B-1. Included are the anticipated effects 
on consumption cause by improvements in energy efficiency and fuel 
switching.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.243

    A comparison of these projections will show the energy use avoidance 
resulting from the investment program as depicted in Figure B-2. Using 
the prices of fuel contained in Appendix C to Subpart A, the dollars 
saved can be projected against the dollars invested. Life cycle costing 
methodology pursuant to subpart A, will be used to determine priorities 
for submitting individual initiatives into the appropriate budget year.
    (b) For energy efficiencies--Energy efficiency baselines and goals 
for each fuel type shall be calculated using the same consumption 
factors and similar methodology to that outlined in paragraph (a). 
Energy consumption by fuel type shall be linked to mission through the 
functional categories listed in Sec. 436.106(a)(2). This will identify 
a rate which will indicate energy efficiency trends. This linkage may be 
accomplished through the following algorithm:

[[Page 567]]

    Step 1: Determine functional categories from section 436.106(a)(2) 
which best describe the Agency overall mission.
    Step 2: Determine types of fuels used to support the functions 
selected in Step 1.
    Step 3: Determine quantities of fuel consumed or planned for 
consumption over a specific period of time.
    Step 4: Determine quantity of output of function for same period of 
time used in Step 3. Quantify output in a standard measure which best 
describes functional category.
    Step 5: Determine the energy efficiency ratio by dividing quantity 
from Step 4 by quantity from Step 3.
    This ratio of fuel consumed to a unit measure of output will be used 
to develop a projection of a baseline and goals through 1990, and used 
in reporting variance. Examples of ratios that should be considered are:

    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Production or industrial process type operations

Ton of product

Cu. ft. of natural gas

    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Services, such as postal delivery

Customers served or
pounds delivered

Gallons of automotive
gasoline

    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> General transportation

Passenger miles

Gallons of automotive gasoline

    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Training

Persons trained
or in training

Gallons of navy special

    Agencies shall select one or more of these ratios, which shall be 
used throughout the planning period, or use more appropriate energy 
efficiency ratios, to describe their overall functions. Figure B-4 
illustrates the planning baseline and goal resulting from this type of 
analysis.

[[Page 568]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.244

    (c) For fuel switching--Fuel switching goals for gasoline other oil-
based fuel and natural gas may be calculated as follows:
    Step 1: For each fiscal year, identify investments, where 
appropriate, in fuel switching

[[Page 569]]

from gasoline, other oil-based fuel and natural gas to alternate 
renewable or nonrenewable fuel sources.
    Step 2: Project for each fiscal year, the avoidance in the use of 
gasoline, other oil-based fuel and natural gas resulting from previous 
fuel switching investments.
    Completion of these steps will permit the formulation of charts such 
as that shown in Figure B-5.

<R05>
    Sec. Appendix D to Part 436--Energy Program Conservation Elements

    (a) In all successful energy conservation programs, certain key 
elements need to be present. The elements listed below must be 
incorporated into each agency conservation program and must be reflected 
in the 10-year plan prescribed in Sec. 436.102. Those organizations 
that have already developed programs should review them to determine 
whether the present management systems incorporate these elements.
    (1) Top Management Control. Top management must have a personal and 
sustained commitment to the program, provide active direction and 
motivation, and require regular review of overall energy usage at senior 
staff meetings.
    (2) Line Management Accountability. Line managers must be 
accountable for the energy conservation performance of their 
organizations and should participate in establishing realistic goals and 
developing strategies and budgets to meet these goals.
    (3) Formal Planning. An overall 10-year plan for the period 1980-
1990 must be developed and formalized which sets forth performance-
oriented conservation goals, including the categorized reduction in 
rates of energy consumption that the program is expected to realize. The 
plan will be supplemented by guidelines enumerating specific 
conservation procedures that will be followed. These procedures and 
initiatives must be life cycle cost-effective as well as energy 
efficient.
    (4) Goals. Goals must be established in a measurable manner to 
answer questions of ``Where are we?'' ``Where do we want to go?'' ``Are 
we getting there?'' and ``Are our initiatives for getting there life 
cycle cost-effective?''
    (5) Monitoring. Progress must be reviewed periodically both at the 
agency headquarters and at local facility levels to identify program 
weakness or additional areas for conservation actions. Progress toward 
achievement of goals should be assessed, and explanations should be 
required for non-achievement or unusual variations in energy use. 
Monitoring should include personal inspections and staff visits, 
management information reporting and audits.
    (6) Using Technical Expertise. Personnel with adequate technical 
background and knowledge of programmatic objectives should be used to 
help management set technical goals and parameters for efficient 
planning and implementation of energy conservation programs. These 
technicians should work in conjunction with the line managers who are 
accountable for both mission accomplishment and energy conservation.
    (7) Employee Awareness. Employees must gain an awareness of energy 
conservation through formal training and employee information programs. 
They should be invited to participate in the process of developing an 
energy conservation program, and to submit definitive suggestions for 
conservation of energy.
    (8) Energy Emergency Planning. Every energy management plan must 
provide for programs to respond to contingencies that may occur at the 
local, state or National level. Programs must be developed for potential 
energy emergency situations calling for reductions of 10 percent, 15 
percent and 20 percent for up to 12 months. Emergency plans must be 
tested to ascertain their effectiveness.
    (9) Budgetary and Fiscal Support. Resources necessary for the energy 
conservation program must be planned and provided for, and the fiscal 
systems adjusted to support energy management investments and 
information reporting.
    (10) Environmental Considerations. Each agency shall fulfill its 
obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act in developing 
its plan.

benefits under this part equivalent to the assistance provided to other 
low-income persons in the State under this part and
    (2) The low-income members of such tribe would be better served by 
means of a grant made directly to provide such assistance.
    (b) In any State for which the Support Office Director shall have 
made the determination referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
Support Office Director shall reserve from the sums that would otherwise 
be allocated to the State under this part not less

[[Page 577]]

than 100 percent, or more than 150 percent, of an amount which bears the 
same ratio to the State's allocation for the fiscal year involved as the 
population of all low-income Native Americans for whom a determination 
under paragraph (a) of this section has been made bears to the 
population of all low-income persons in the State.
    (c) The Support Office Director shall make the determination 
prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section in the event a State:
    (1) Does not apply within the sixty-day time period prescribed in

paragraph (b) of this section shall be granted to the tribal 
organization serving the individuals for whom the determination has been 
made, or where there is no tribal organization, to such other entity as 
the Support Office Director determines is able to provide adequate 
weatherization assistance pursuant to this part. Where the Support 
Office Director intends to make a grant to an organization to perform 
services benefiting more than one Indian tribe, the approval of each 
Indian tribe shall be a prerequisite for the issuance of a notice of 
grant award.
    (e) Within 30 days after the Support Office Director has reserved 
funds pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Support Office 
Director shall give written notice to the tribal organization or other 
qualified entity of the amount of funds reserved and its eligibility to

Sec. 440.21  Weatherization materials standards and energy audit procedures.

    (a) Paragraph (b) of this section describes the required standards 
for weatherization materials. Paragraph (c)(1) of this section describes 
the performance and quality standards for renewable energy systems. 
Paragraph (c)(2) of this section specifies the procedures and criteria 
that are used for considering a petition from a manufacturer requesting 
the Secretary to certify an item as a renewable energy system. 
Paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section describe the cost-effectiveness 
tests that weatherization materials must pass before they may be 
installed in an eligible dwelling unit. Paragraph (f) of this section 
lists the other energy audit requirements that do not pertain to cost-
effectiveness tests of weatherization materials. Paragraphs (g) and (h) 
of this section describe the use of priority lists and presumptively 
cost-effective general heat waste reduction materials as part of a 
State's energy audit procedures. Paragraph (i) of this section explains 
that a State's energy audit procedures and priority lists must be re-
approved by DOE every five years.
    (b) Only weatherization materials which are listed in appendix A to 
this part and which meet or exceed standards prescribed in appendix A to 
this part may be purchased with funds provided under this part. However, 
DOE may approve an unlisted material upon application from any State.
    (c)(1) A system or technology shall not be considered by DOE to be a 
renewable energy system under this part unless:
    (i) It will result in a reduction in oil or natural gas consumption;
    (ii) It will not result in an increased use of any item which is 
known to be, or reasonably expected to be, environmentally hazardous or 
a threat to public health or safety;
    (iii) Available Federal subsidies do not make such a specification 
unnecessary or inappropriate (in light of the most advantageous 
allocation of economic resources); and
    (iv) If a combustion rated system, it has a thermal efficiency 
rating of at least 75 percent; or, in the case of a solar system, it has 
a thermal efficiency rating of at least 15 percent.
    (2) Any manufacturer may submit a petition to DOE requesting the 
Secretary to certify an item as a renewable energy system.
    (i) Petitions should be submitted to: Weatherization Assistance 
Program, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable, Mail Stop EE-2K, 
1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585.
    (ii) A petition for certification of an item as a renewable energy 
system must be accompanied by information demonstrating that the item 
meets the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (iii) DOE may publish a document in the Federal Register that 
invites public comment on a petition.

[[Page 584]]

    (iv) DOE shall notify the petitioner of the Secretary's action on 
the request within one year after the filing of a complete petition, and 
shall publish notice of approvals and denials in the Federal Register.
    (d) Except for materials to eliminate health and safety hazards 
allowable under Sec. 440.18(c)(15), each individual weatherization 
material and package of weatherization materials installed in an 
eligible dwelling unit must be cost-effective. These materials must 
result in energy cost savings over the lifetime of the measure(s), 
discounted to present value, that equal or exceed the cost of materials, 
installation, and on-site supervisory personnel as defined by the 
Department. States have the option of requiring additional related costs 
to be included in the determination of cost-effectiveness. The cost of 
incidental repairs must be included in the cost of the package of 
measures installed in a dwelling.
    (e) The energy audit procedures must assign priorities among 
individual weatherization materials in descending order of their cost-
effectiveness according to paragraph (d) of this section after:
    (1) Adjusting for interaction between architectural and mechanical 
weatherization materials by using generally accepted engineering methods 
to decrease the estimated fuel cost savings for a lower priority 
weatherization material in light of fuel cost savings for a related 
higher priority weatherization material; and
    (2) Eliminating any weatherization materials that are no longer 
cost-effective, as adjusted under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (f) The energy audit procedures also must--
    (1) Compute the cost of fuel saved per year by taking into account 
the climatic data of the area where the dwelling unit is located, where 
the base temperature that determines the number of heating or cooling 
degree days (if used) reasonably approximates conditions when operation 
of heating and cooling equipment is required to maintain comfort, and 
must otherwise use reasonable energy estimating methods and assumptions;
    (2) Determine existing energy use and energy requirements of the 
dwelling unit from actual energy bills or by generally accepted 
engineering calculations;
    (3) Address significant heating and cooling needs;
    (4) Make provision for the use of advanced diagnostic and assessment 
techniques which DOE has determined are consistent with sound 
engineering practices;
    (5) Identify health and safety hazards to be abated with DOE funds 
in compliance with the State's DOE-approved health and safety procedures 
under Sec. 440.16(h);
    (6) Treat the dwelling unit as a whole system by examining its 
heating and cooling system, its air exchange system, and its occupants' 
living habits and needs, and making necessary adjustments to the 
priority of weatherization materials with adequate documentation of the 
reasons for such an adjustment; and
    (7) Be specifically approved by DOE for use on each major dwelling 
type that represents a significant portion of the State's weatherization 
program in light of the varying energy audit requirements of different 
dwelling types including single-family dwellings, multi-family 
buildings, and mobile homes.
    (g) For similar dwelling units without unusual energy-consuming 
characteristics, energy audits may be accomplished by using a priority 
list developed by conducting, in compliance with paragraphs (b) through 
(f) of this section, site-specific energy audits of a representative 
subset of these dwelling units. For DOE approval, States must describe 
how the priority list was developed, how the subset of similar homes was 
determined, and circumstances that will require site-specific audits 
rather than the use of the priority lists. States also must provide the 
input data and list of weatherization measures recommended by the energy 
audit software or manual methods for several dwelling units from the 
subset of similar units.
    (h) States may use, as a part of an energy audit, general heat waste 
reduction weatherization materials that DOE has determined to be 
generally

[[Page 585]]

cost-effective. States may request approval to use general heat waste 
materials not listed in DOE policy guidance by providing documentation 
of their cost-effectiveness and a description of the circumstances under 
which such materials will be used.
    (i) States must resubmit their energy audit procedures (and priority 
lists, if applicable, under certain conditions) to DOE for approval 
every five years. States must also resubmit to DOE, for approval every 
five years, their list of general heat waste materials in addition to 
those approved by DOE in policy guidance, if applicable. Policy guidance 
will describe the information States must submit to DOE and the 
circumstances that reduce or increase documentation requirements.

    (i) Are eligible dwelling units, or
    (ii) Will become eligible dwelling units within 180 days under a 
Federal, State, or local government program for rehabilitating the 
building or making similar improvements to the building; and
    (3) The grantee has established procedures for dwellings which 
consist of a rental unit or rental units to ensure that:
    (i) The benefits of weatherization assistance in connection with 
such rental units, including units where the tenants pay for their 
energy through their rent, will accrue primarily to the low-income 
tenants residing in such units;
    (ii) For a reasonable period of time after weatherization work has 
been completed on a dwelling containing a unit occupied by an eligible 
household, the tenants in that unit (including households paying for 
their energy through their rent) will not be subjected to rent increases 
unless those increases are demonstrably related to matters other than 
the weatherization work performed;
    (iii) The enforcement of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section is 
provided through procedures established by the State by which tenants 
may file complaints, and owners, in response to such complaints, shall 
demonstrate that the rent increase concerned is related to matters other 
than the weatherization work performed; and
    (iv) No undue or excessive enhancement shall occur to the value of 
the dwelling units.
    (c) In order to secure the Federal investment made under this part 
and address the issues of eviction from and sale of property receiving 
weatherization materials under this part, States may seek landlord 
agreement to placement of a lien or to other contractual restrictions;
    (d) As a condition of having assistance provided under this part 
with respect to multifamily buildings, a State may require financial 
participation, when feasible, from the owners of such buildings. Such 
financial participation

[[Page 586]]

shall not be reported as program income, nor will it be treated as if it 
were appropriated funds. The funds contributed by the landlord shall be 
expended in accordance with the agreement between the landlord and the 
weatherization agency.
    (e) In devising procedures under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this 
section, States should consider requiring use of alternative dispute 
resolution procedures including arbitration.
    (f) A State may weatherize shelters. For the purpose of determining 
how many dwelling units exist in a shelter, a grantee may count each 800 
square feet of the shelter as a dwelling unit or it may count each floor 
of the shelter as a dwelling unit.

[[Page 597]]

    (c) DOE determinations. The Assistant Secretary for Energy 
Efficiency and Renewable Energy shall determine the extent to which 
appropriated funds are available to be obligated under this program for 
each fiscal year. Upon evaluating each application and any other 
relevant information, DOE shall further determine:
    (1) Eligibility of the applicant for receipt of an incentive 
payment, based on the criteria for eligibility specified in this part;
    (2) The number of kilowatt-hours to be used in calculating a 
potential incentive payment, based on the net electric energy generated 
from a qualified renewable energy source at the qualified renewable 
energy facility and sold during the prior fiscal year;
    (3) The number of kilowatt-hours to be used in calculating a 
potential additional incentive payment, based on the total quantity of 
accrued energy generated during prior fiscal years;
    (4) The amounts represented by 60 percent of available funds and by 
40 percent of available funds; and
    (5) Whether justification exists for altering the 60:40 payment 
ratio specified in paragraph (e) of this section. If DOE intends to 
modify the 60:40 ratio, the Department shall notify Congress, setting 
forth reasons for such change.
    (d) Calculating payments. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) 
of this section, potential incentive payments under this part shall be 
determined by multiplying the number of kilowatt-hours determined under 
Sec. 451.9(c)(2) by 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, and adjusting that 
product for inflation for each fiscal year beginning after calendar year 
1993 in the same manner as provided in section 29(d)(2)(B) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, except that in applying such provisions 
calendar year 1993 shall be substituted for calendar year 1979. Using 
the same procedure, a potential additional payment shall be determined 
for the number of kilowatt-hours determined under paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section. If the sum of these calculated payments does not exceed 
the funds determined to be available by the Assistant Secretary for 
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy under Sec. 451.9(c), DOE shall 
make payments to all qualified applicants.
    (e) Insufficient funds. If funds are not sufficient to make full 
incentive payments to all qualified applicants, DOE shall--
    (1) Calculate potential incentive payments, if necessary on a pro 
rata basis, not to exceed 60 percent of available funds to owners or 
operators of qualified renewable energy facilities using solar, wind, 
ocean, geothermal, and closed-loop biomass technologies based on prior 
year energy generation;
    (2) Calculate potential incentive payments, if necessary on a pro 
rata basis, not to exceed 40 percent of available funds to owners or 
operators of all other qualified renewable energy facilities based on 
prior year energy generation;
    (3) If the amounts calculated in paragraph (e)(1) and (2) of this 
section result in one owner group with insufficient funds and one with 
excess funds, allocate excess funds to the owner group with insufficient 
funds and calculate additional incentive payments, on a pro rata basis 
if necessary, to such owners or operators based on prior year energy 
generation.
    (4) If potential payments calculated in paragraphs (e)(1), (2), and 
(3) of this section do not exceed available funding, allocate 60% of 
remaining funds to paragraph (e)(1) recipients and 40% to paragraph 
(e)(2) recipients and calculate additional incentive payments, if 
necessary on a pro rata basis, to owners or operators based on accrued 
energy;
    (5) If the amounts calculated in paragraph (e)(4) of this section 
result in one owner group with insufficient funds and one with excess 
funds, allocate excess funds to the owner group with insufficient funds 
and calculate additional incentive payments, on a pro rata basis if 
necessary, to such owners or operators based on accrued energy.
    (6) Notify Congress if potential payments resulting from paragraphs 
(e)(3) or (5) of this section above will result in alteration of the 
60:40 payment ratio;
    (7) Make incentive payments based on the sum of the amounts 
determined in paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) of this section for each 
applicant;
    (8) Treat the number of kilowatt-hours for which an incentive 
payment

[[Page 598]]

is not made as a result of insufficient funds as accrued energy for 
which future incentive payment may be made; and
    (9) Maintain a record of each applicant's accrued energy.
    (f) Notice to applicant. After calculating the amount of the 
incentive payment under paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section, the 
DOE Deciding Official shall then issue a written notice of the 
determination to the applicant--
    (1) Approving the application as eligible for payment and forwarding 
a copy to the DOE Finance Office with a request to pay;
    (2) Setting forth the calculation of the approved amount of the 
incentive payment; and
    (3) Stating the amount of accrued energy, measured in kilowatt-
hours, for each qualified renewable energy facility, if any, and the 
energy source for same.
    (g) Disqualification. If the application does not meet the 
requirements of this part or some of the kilowatt-hours claimed in the 
application are disallowed as unqualified, the Deciding Official shall 
issue a written notice denying the application in whole or in part with 
an explanation of the basis for denial.

Sec. 451.10  Administrative appeals.

    (a) In order to exhaust administrative remedies, an applicant who 
receives a notice denying an application in whole or in part shall 
appeal, on or before 45 days from date of the notice issued by the DOE 
Deciding Official, to the Office of Hearings and Appeals, 1000 
Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20585, in accordance with 
the procedures set forth in subpart C of 10 CFR part 1003.
    (b) If an applicant does not appeal under paragraph (a) of this 
section, the determination of the DOE Deciding Official shall become 
final for DOE and judicially unreviewable.
    (c) If an applicant appeals on a timely basis under paragraph (a) of 
this section, the decision and order of the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals shall be final for DOE.

prior 12-month period, by month if possible, when demand charges are 
included in current energy prices or when the technical assistance 
report recommends an energy conservation measure that shifts energy 
usage to periods of lower demand and cost; and
    (6) A signed and dated certification that the technical assistance 
program has been conducted in accordance with the requirements of this 
section and that the data presented is accurate to the best of the 
technical assistance analyst's knowledge.


<R05>
Sec. 455.63  Cost-effectiveness testing.

    (a) This paragraph applies to calculation of the simple payback 
period of energy conservation measures.
    (1) The simple payback period of each energy conservation measure 
(except measures to shift demand, or renewable

[[Page 613]]

resource measures) shall be calculated, taking into account the 
interactions among the various measures, by dividing the estimated total 
cost of the measure, as determined pursuant to Sec. 455.62(d)(3)(ii), 
by the estimated annual cost savings accruing from the measure (adjusted 
for demand charges), as determined pursuant to Sec. 455.62(d)(3)(vi), 
provided that:
    (i) At least 50 percent of the annual cost savings used in this 
calculation shall be from the cost of the energy to be saved or a higher 
percent if required by a State in its State Plan pursuant to Sec. 
455.20(u)(3); and
    (ii) No more than 50 percent of the annual cost savings used in this 
calculation shall be from other cost savings, such as those resulting 
from energy conservation maintenance and operating procedures related to 
particular energy conservation measures, or from changes in type of fuel 
used, or a lower percent if required by a State in its State Plan 
pursuant to Sec. 455.20(u)(3).
    (2) The simple payback period of each renewable resource energy 
conservation measure shall be calculated, taking into account the 
interactions among the various measures, by dividing the estimated total 
cost of the measure, as determined pursuant to Sec. 455.62(d)(3)(ii), 
by the estimated annual cost savings accruing from the measure taking 
into account at least the annual cost of the non-renewable fuels 
displaced less the annual cost of the renewable fuel, if any, and the 
annual cost of any backup non-renewable fuel needed to operate the 
system, adjusted for demand charges, as determined pursuant to Sec. 
455.62(d)(3)(vi).
    (3) The simple payback period of each energy conservation measure 
designed to shift demand to a period of lower demand and lower cost 
shall be calculated, taking into account the interactions among the 
various measures, by dividing the estimated total cost of the measure, 
as determined pursuant to Sec. 455.62(d)(3)(ii), by the estimated 
annual cost savings accruing from the measure taking into account at 
least the annual cost of the energy used before the measure is installed 
less the estimated annual cost of the energy to be used after the 
measure is installed, adjusted for demand charges, as determined 
pursuant to Sec. 455.62(d)(3)(vi).
    (b) This paragraph applies, in addition to paragraph (a) of this 
section, if the State plan requires the cost effectiveness of an energy 
conservation measure to be determined by life-cycle cost analysis or if 
the applicant requests such an analysis.
    (1) A life-cycle cost analysis, showing a savings-to-investment 
ratio greater than or equal to one over the useful life of the energy 
conservation measure or 15 years, whichever is less, shall be conducted 
in accordance with the requirements set forth in the State Plan pursuant 
to Sec. Sec. 455.20(u)(2), 455.20(u)(3) and Sec. 455.64.
    (2) The resulting savings-to-investment ratio shall be used for the 
purpose of ranking applications.


<R05>
Sec. 455.64  Life-cycle cost methodology.

    (a) The life-cycle cost methodology under Sec. 455.63(b) of this 
part is a systematic comparison of the relevant significant cost savings 
and costs associated with an energy conservation measure over its 
expected useful life, or other appropriate study period with future cost 
savings and costs discounted to present value. The format for displaying 
life-cycle costs shall be a savings-to-investment ratio.
    (b) An energy conservation measure must be cost effective, and its 
savings-to-investment ratio must be greater than or equal to one no 
earlier than the end of the second year of the study period.
    (c) A savings-to-investment ratio is the ratio of the present value 
of net cost savings attributable to an energy conservation measure to 
the present value of the net increase in investment, maintenance and 
operating, and replacement costs less salvage value or disposal cost 
attributable to that measure over a study period.
    (d) Except for energy conservation measures to shift demand or to 
use renewable energy resources, the numerator of the savings-to-
investment ratio shall include net cost savings, appropriately 
discounted and adjusted for energy cost escalation consistent with 
paragraph (g) of this section, subject to the limitation that the cost 
of the energy to be saved shall constitute at

[[Page 614]]

least 50 percent of the net cost savings unless the State specifies a 
higher percent in its State plan pursuant to Sec. 455.20(u)(3).
    (e) With respect to energy conservation measures to shift demand or 
to use renewable energy resources, the numerator of the savings-to-
investment ratio shall be net cost savings appropriately discounted and 
adjusted for energy cost escalation consistent with paragraph (g) of 
this section.
    (f) The study period for a life-cycle cost analysis, which may not 
exceed 15 years, shall be the useful life of the energy conservation 
measure or of the energy conservation measure with the longest life (for 
purposes of ranking buildings with multiple energy conservation 
measures).
    (g) The discount rate must equal or exceed the discount rate 
annually provided by DOE under 10 CFR part 436. The energy cost 
escalation rates must not exceed those annually provided by DOE under 10 
CFR part 436.
    (h) Investment costs may be assumed to be a lump sum occurring at 
the beginning of the base year, or to the extent that there are future 
investment costs, discounted to present value.
    (i) The cost of energy and maintenance and operating costs may be 
assumed to begin to accrue at the beginning of the base year or when 
they are actually projected to occur.
    (j) It may be assumed that costs occur in a lump sum at any time 
within the year in which they are incurred.

exceptions specified in Sec. Sec. 455.141(a), 455.142(a), 455.142(b), 
or for severe hardship assistance specified in Sec. 455.142(c). In 
cases of severe hardship, the Federal share of the cost cannot exceed 90 
percent.


<R05>
Sec. 455.101  Borrowing the non-Federal share/title to equipment.

    The non-Federal share of the costs of acquiring and installing 
energy conservation measures may be provided by using financing or other 
forms of borrowed funds, such as those provided by loans and performance 
contracts, even if such financing does not provide for the grantee to 
receive clear title to the equipment being financed until after the 
grant is closed out. However, grantees in such cases must otherwise meet 
all the requirements of this part, and financing and loan agreements and 
performance contracts under this section are subject to the requirements 
of 10 CFR Part 600 and the certification requirements under Sec. 
455.111(e). Grantees must receive clear title to the equipment when the 
loan is paid off.


<R05>
Sec. 455.102  Energy conservation measure cost-share credit.

    To the extent a State provides in its State Plan, DOE may wholly or 
partially credit the costs of the following, with respect to a building, 
toward the required cost-share for an energy conservation measure grant 
in that building:
    (a) A non-Federally funded technical assistance program;
    (b) A non-Federally funded technical assistance program update to 
comply with Sec. 455.20(q); and
    (c) The non-Federally funded implementation of one or more energy 
conservation measures, which complies with the eligibility criteria set 
forth in Sec. 455.71.


<R05>
Sec. 455.103  Requirements for applications for credit.

    (a) If a State has provided for credit in its State Plan pursuant to 
Sec. 455.20(w), applications for credit will be considered only when 
the technical assistance programs or updates and the energy conservation 
measure projects for which credit is sought meet the applicable program 
requirements, such as those specified in Sec. 455.61, Sec. 455.62, 
Sec. 455.71, and the relevant sections of 10 CFR part 600, except that 
the project need not comply with the Davis-Bacon Act regarding labor 
standards or wage rates.
    (b) Credit for energy conservation measures will be considered only 
when supported by a technical assistance analysis that meets the 
requirements of Sec. 455.62 and that was performed prior to the 
installation of the energy conservation measures.


<R05>
Sec. 455.104  Rebates from utilities and other entities.

    (a) Grantees which receive rebates or other monetary considerations 
from utilities or other entities for installing the energy conservation 
measures funded by a grant under this part may use such funds to meet 
their cost- sharing obligations pursuant to Sec. 455.100.
    (b) Where the rebate or monetary consideration does not exceed the 
non-Federal share of the cost of the measures applied for in a grant 
application, grantees are not required to deduct the

[[Page 617]]

amount of the rebate or monetary consideration from the cost of the 
measures, and DOE does not consider such rebates or monetary 
considerations to be program income which would have to be remitted to 
DOE upon receipt by the grantee.
    (c) Where the rebate or monetary consideration does exceed the non-
Federal share of the cost of the measures applied for in a grant 
application, grantees may use the excess to fund additional measures if 
such measures have been recommended in the technical assistance report. 
If it is not possible to use the excess funding in this way, the grantee 
must reduce the cost--and DOE will reduce the Federal share--by the 
amount of the excess above the non-Federal share.

Sec. 455.131  State ranking of grant applications.

    (a) Except as provided by Sec. 455.92 of this part, all eligible 
applications received by the State will be ranked by the State in 
accordance with its approved State Plan.
    (b) For technical assistance programs, buildings shall be ranked in 
descending priority based upon the energy conservation potential, on a 
savings percentage basis, of the building as determined in the energy 
audit or energy use evaluation pursuant to Sec. 455.20(k). Each State 
shall develop separate rankings for all buildings covered by eligible 
applications for:
    (1) Technical assistance programs for units of local government and 
public care institutions and
    (2) Technical assistance programs for schools and hospitals.
    (c) All eligible applications for energy conservation measures 
received will be ranked by the State on building-by-building or a 
measure-by-measure basis. If a State ranks on a building-by-building 
basis, several buildings may be ranked as a single building if the 
application proposes a single energy conservation measure which is 
physically connected to all of the buildings. If a State ranks on a 
measure-by-measure basis, a measure that is physically connected to a 
number of buildings may be ranked as a single measure. Buildings or 
measures shall be ranked in accordance with the procedures established 
by the State Plan on the basis of the information developed during a 
technical assistance program (or its equivalent) for the building and 
the criteria for ranking applications. The criterion set forth in 
paragraph (1) of this subsection shall receive at least 50 percent of 
the weight given to the criteria used to rank applications. Each State 
may assign weights to the other criteria as set forth in the State Plan 
pursuant to Sec. 455.20(e). The criteria for ranking applications are:
    (1) Simple payback or a life-cycle cost analysis, calculated in 
accordance with Sec. 455.63 and Sec. 455.64, as applicable;
    (2) The types and quantities of energy to be saved, including oil, 
natural gas, or electricity, in a priority as established in the 
approved State Plan;
    (3) The types of energy sources to which conversion is proposed, 
including renewable energy;
    (4) The quality of the technical assistance program report; and
    (5) Other factors as determined by the State.
    (d) A State is exempt from the ranking requirements of this section 
when:
    (1) The total amount requested by all applications for schools and 
hospitals for technical assistance and energy conservation measures in a 
given grant program cycle for grants up to 50 percent is less than or 
equal to the funds available to the State for such grants and the total 
amount recommended for hardship funding is less than or equal to the 
amounts available to the State for such grants and
    (2) The total amount requested by all applications for buildings 
owned by units of local government and public care institutions in a 
given grant program cycle is less than or equal to the total amount 
allocated to the State for technical assistance program grants in the 
State;
    (e) If a State elects to permit applications for credit pursuant to 
Sec. 455.102, such applications for completed or partially completed 
energy conservation measures shall reflect both the work done and the 
work to be done and will be reviewed and ranked on the basis of the cost 
of all of the measures in the project. The credit shall not exceed the 
non-Federal share of the proposed additional energy conservation 
measures (and the Federal share shall not exceed the cost of the work 
remaining to be done).
    (f) Within the rankings of school and hospital buildings for 
technical assistance and energy conservation measures including

Sec. 455.132  State evaluation of requests for severe hardship assistance.

    (a) To the extent provided in Sec. 455.30(d), financial assistance 
will be initially available for schools and hospitals experiencing 
severe hardship based upon an applicant's inability to provide the non-
Federal share as specified in the State plan pursuant to Sec. 
455.20(g). This financial assistance will be available only to the 
extent necessary to enable such institutions to participate in the 
program.
    (b) The State shall recommend funds for severe hardship applications 
wholly or partially from the funds reserved in accordance with Sec. 
455.30(d) and as stated in an approved State Plan.
    (c) Applications for Federal funding in excess of the non-Federal 
share in the State plan pursuant to Sec. 455.20(x) based on claims of 
severe hardship shall be given an additional evaluation by the State to 
assess on a quantifiable basis to the maximum extent practicable the 
relative need among eligible institutions. The minimum amount of 
additional Federal funding necessary for the applicant to participate in 
the program will be determined by the State in accordance with the 
procedures established in the State Plan. The primary consideration 
shall be the institution's inability to provide the non-Federal share of 
the project cost as specified in the State plan pursuant to Sec. 
455.20(x). Secondary criteria such as climate, fuel cost and fuel 
availability, borrowing capacity, median family income in the area, and 
other relevant factors as determined by the State may be addressed in 
the State Plan as specified in Sec. 455.20(g).
    (d) A State shall indicate, for those schools and hospitals with the 
highest rankings, determined pursuant to Sec. 455.131(b) and (c):
    (1) The amount of additional hardship funding requested by each 
eligible applicant for each building determined to be in a class of 
severe hardship and
    (2) The amount of hardship funding recommended by the State based 
upon relative need, as determined in accordance with the State Plan, to 
the limit of the hardship funds available. The State must decide on a 
case-by-case basis whether, and to what extent, it will recommend 
hardship funding.
    (e) If there are insufficient applications from hardship applicants 
to cover the 10 percent allocation provided for in Sec. 455.30(d), then 
the State may recommend use of the remaining funds for other qualified 
applicants. The total amount recommended for hardship grants cannot 
exceed the 10 percent limit.

allocation to DOE once each program cycle along with a listing of 
buildings or measures covered by eligible applications for schools, 
hospitals, units of local government, and public care institutions 
ranked by the State if necessary pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 
455.131. If ranking has been employed, the list shall include the 
standings of buildings or measures.
    (1) Measure-by-measure rankings will be recombined for the 
respective buildings with more than one recommended measure and
    (2) Buildings will be consolidated under one grantee application.
    (b) The State shall indicate the amount of financial assistance 
requested by the applicant for each eligible building and, for those 
buildings recommended for funding within the limits of the State's 
allocation, the amount recommended for funding. If the amount 
recommended is less than the amount requested by the applicant, the list 
shall also indicate the reason for that recommendation.
    (c) The State shall indicate that it has reviewed and evaluated all 
of the submitted applications and that those applications meet the 
relevant requirements of the program, and shall certify that 
applications submitted are eligible pursuant to Sec. 455.130(a).

Sec. 455.140  Approval of applications from institutions and coordinating agencies for technical assistance and energy conservation measures.

    (a) DOE shall review and approve applications submitted by a State 
in accordance with Sec. 455.133 if DOE determines that the applications 
meet the objectives of the Act, and comply with the applicable State 
Plan and the requirements of this part. DOE may disapprove all or any 
portion of an application to the extent funds are not available to carry 
out a program or measure (or portion thereof) contained in the 
application, or for such other reason as DOE may deem appropriate.
    (b) DOE shall notify a State and the applicant of the final approval 
or disapproval of an application at the earliest practicable date after 
the DOE receipt of the application, and, in the event of disapproval, 
shall include a statement of the reasons therefor.
    (c) An application which has been disapproved for reasons other than 
lack of funds may be amended to correct the cause of its disapproval and 
resubmitted in the same manner as the original application at any time 
within the same grant program cycle. Such an application will be 
considered to the extent funds have not already been designated for 
applicants by the ranking process at the time of resubmittal. However, 
nothing in this provision shall obligate either the State or DOE to take 
final action regarding a resubmitted application within the grant 
program cycle. An application not acted upon may be resubmitted in a 
subsequent grant program cycle.
    (d) DOE shall not provide supplemental funds to cover cost overruns 
or other additional costs beyond those provided for in the original 
grant award for technical assistance projects and shall fund only one 
technical assistance project per building.
    (e) DOE shall not provide supplemental funds to cover cost overruns 
or other additional costs beyond those provided for in the original 
grant award for energy conservation measures funded under a grant in a 
given grant program cycle. DOE shall not

[[Page 626]]

provide funds to cover energy conservation measures intended to replace 
energy conservation measures funded in an earlier grant cycle unless the 
State has funds remaining after all applications for new energy 
conservation measures have been evaluated and submitted to DOE for 
funding.
    (f) If provided for in the State Plan, an applicant may reapply for 
a technical assistance program or an energy conservation measure grant 
which was included in a prior grant application but which was not 
implemented and for which no funds were expended.
    (g) An applicant may apply for, and DOE may make, grant awards in 
another grant program cycle for additional energy conservation measures 
which relate to a building which previously received grants for other 
energy conservation measures.
    (h) Funds which become available to a grantee after the installation 
of all approved measures, due to cost underruns in the installed 
measures, may be used by the grantee for additional measures if such 
measures are approved in writing by the State and DOE.
    (i) DOE may fund costs incurred by an applicant for technical 
assistance and energy conservation measure projects after the date of 
the grant application, so long as that date is no earlier than the close 
of the preceding grant program cycle. Such costs may be funded when, in 
the judgment of DOE, the applicant has complied with program 
requirements and the costs incurred are allowable under applicable cost 
principles and the approved project budget. The applicant bears the 
responsibility for the entire project cost unless the application is 
approved by DOE in accordance with this part.
    (j) In addition to the prior approval requirements for project 
changes as specified in the DOE Financial Assistance Rules (10 CFR part 
600), a grantee shall request prior written approval from DOE before:
    (1) Transferring DOE or matching amounts between buildings included 
in an approved application when the State ranks applications on a 
building-by-building basis or
    (2) Transferring DOE or matching amounts between energy conservation 
measures included in an approved application when the State ranks on a 
measure-by-measure basis.

    Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule energy consumption value means 
the average number of Watt-hours of electrical energy required for an 
electric vehicle to travel one mile of the Urban Dynamometer Driving 
Schedule, as determined by the Environmental Protection Agency.


<R05>
Sec. 474.3  Petroleum-equivalent fuel economy calculation.

    (a) The petroleum-equivalent fuel economy for an electric vehicle is 
calculated as follows:
    (1) Determine the electric vehicle's Urban Dynamometer Driving 
Schedule energy consumption value and the Highway Fuel Economy Driving 
Schedule energy consumption value in units of Watt-hours per mile;
    (2) Determine the combined energy consumption value by averaging the 
Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule energy consumption value and the 
Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule energy consumption value using a 
weighting of 55 percent urban/45 percent highway; and
    (3) Calculate the petroleum-equivalent fuel economy by dividing the 
appropriate petroleum-equivalency factor (depending on whether any 
petroleum-powered accessories are installed; see paragraph (b) of this 
section) by the combined energy consumption value, and round to the 
nearest 0.01 miles per gallon.
    (b) The petroleum-equivalency factors for electric vehicles are as 
follows:
    (1) If the electric vehicle does not have any petroleum-powered 
accessories installed, the value of the petroleum equivalency factor is 
82,049 Watt-hours per gallon.
    (2) If the electric vehicle has any petroleum-powered accessories 
installed, the value of the petroleum-equivalency factor is 73,844 Watt-
hours per gallon.


<R05>
Sec. 474.4  Test procedures.

    (a) The electric vehicle energy consumption values used in the 
calculation of petroleum-equivalent fuel economy under Sec. 474.3 of 
this part will be determined by the Environmental Protection Agency 
using the Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule and Urban Dynamometer 
Driving Schedule test cycles at 40 CFR parts 86 and 600.
    (b) The ``Special Test Procedures'' provisions of 40 CFR 86.090-27 
may be used to accommodate any special test procedures required for 
testing the energy consumption of electric vehicles.

<R05>
  Sec. Appendix to Part 474--Sample Petroleum-Equivalent Fuel Economy 
                              Calculations

    Example 1: An electric vehicle is tested in accordance with 
Environmental Protection Agency procedures and is found to have an Urban 
Dynamometer Driving Schedule energy consumption value of 265 Watt-hours 
per mile and a Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule energy consumption 
value of 220 Watt-hours per mile. The vehicle is not equipped with any 
petroleum-powered accessories. The combined electrical energy 
consumption value is determined by averaging the Urban Dynamometer 
Driving Schedule energy consumption value and the Highway Fuel Economy 
Driving Schedule energy consumption value using weighting factors of 55 
percent urban, and 45 percent highway:

combined electrical energy consumption value = (0.55 * urban) + (0.45 * 
highway) = (0.55 * 265) + (0.45 * 220) = 244.75 Wh/mile

    Since the vehicle does not have any petroleum-powered accessories 
installed, the value of the petroleum equivalency factor is 82,049 Watt-
hours per gallon, and the petroleum-equivalent fuel economy is:

(82,049 Wh/gal) (244.75 Wh/mile) = 335.24 mpg
    Example 2: The vehicle from Example 1 is equipped with an optional 
diesel-fired cabin heater/defroster. For the purposes of this example, 
it is assumed that the electrical efficiency of the vehicle is 
unaffected.
    Since the vehicle has a petroleum-powered accessory installed, the 
value of the petroleum equivalency factor is 73,844 Watt-hours per 
gallon, and the petroleum-equivalent fuel economy is:

(73,844 Wh/gal) (244.75 Wh/mile) = 301.71 mpg

<R05>
Sec. 490.200  Purpose and scope.

    This subpart sets forth rules implementing the provisions of Section 
507(o) of the Act which requires, subject to some exemptions, that 
certain percentages of new light duty motor vehicles acquired for State 
fleets be alternative fueled vehicles.


<R05>
Sec. 490.201  Alternative fueled vehicle acquisition mandate schedule.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this part, of the new light duty 
motor

[[Page 647]]

vehicles acquired annually for State government fleets, including 
agencies thereof but excluding municipal fleets, the following 
percentages shall be alternative fueled vehicles for the following model 
years;
    (1) 10 percent for model year 1997;
    (2) 15 percent for model year 1998;
    (3) 25 percent for model year 1999;
    (4) 50 percent for model year 2000; and
    (5) 75 percent for model year 2001 and thereafter.
    (b) Each State shall calculate its alternative fueled vehicle 
acquisition requirements for the State government fleets, including 
agencies thereof, by applying the alternative fueled vehicle acquisition 
percentages for each model year to the total number of new light duty 
motor vehicles to be acquired during that model year for those fleets.
    (c) If the calculation performed under paragraph (b) of this section 
produces a number that requires the acquisition of a partial vehicle, an 
adjustment to the acquisition number will be made by rounding the number 
of vehicles down the next whole number if the fraction is less than one 
half and by rounding the number of vehicles up to the next whole number 
if the fraction is equal to or greater than one half.
    (d) A State fleet that first becomes subject to this part after 
model year 1997 shall acquire alternative fueled vehicles in the next 
model year at the percentage applicable to that model year according to 
the schedule in paragraph (a) of this section, unless the State is 
granted an exemption or reduction of the acquisition percentage pursuant 
to the procedures and criteria in section 490.204.


<R05>
Sec. 490.202  Acquisitions satisfying the mandate.

    The following actions within a model year qualify as acquisitions

identifying what portion of the alternative fueled vehicle acquisition 
requirement should be subject to the exemption and describing the 
specific nature of the financial hardship that precludes compliance.
    (f) Requests for exemption shall be addressed to the U.S. Department 
of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EE-33, 1000 
Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20585, or to such other address 
as DOE may announce in a Federal Register notice.
    (g) The Assistant Secretary shall provide to the State, within 45 
days of receipt of a request that complies with this section, a written 
determination as to whether the State's request has been granted or 
denied.
    (h) If the Assistant Secretary denies an exemption, in whole or in 
part, and the State wishes to exhaust administrative remedies, the State 
must appeal within 30 days of the date of the determination, pursuant to 
10 CFR part 1003, subpart C, to the Office of Hearings and Appeals, U.S. 
Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20585. 
The Assistant Secretary's determination shall be stayed during the 
pendency of an appeal under this paragraph.

    DOE grants a State or covered person a waiver:
    (a) If DOE determines that the State or covered person will achieve 
a reduction in petroleum consumption, through eligible reductions as 
specified in Sec. 490.804 of this subpart, equal to the amount of 
alternative fuel used if the following vehicles were operated 100 
percent of the time on alternative fuel

[[Page 658]]

during the model year for which a waiver is requested:
    (1) Previously required alternative fueled vehicles in the fleet's 
inventory at the start of the model year for which a waiver is 
requested;
    (2) Alternative fueled vehicles that the State or covered person 
would have been required to acquire in the model year for which a waiver 
is requested, and in previous model years in which a waiver was granted, 
absent any waivers;
    (b) The State or covered person is in compliance with all applicable 
vehicle emission standards established by the Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 
et seq.); and
    (c) The State or covered person is in compliance with all applicable 
requirements of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 490.804  Eligible reductions in petroleum consumption.

    (a) Motor vehicles. Demonstrated reductions in petroleum consumption 
during the model year for which a waiver is requested that are 
attributable to motor vehicles owned, operated, leased or otherwise 
under the control of a State or covered person are applicable towards 
the petroleum fuel reduction required in Sec. 490.803(a) of this 
subpart.
    (b) Qualified nonroad vehicles. Demonstrated reductions in petroleum 
consumption during the model year for which a waiver is requested that 
are attributable to nonroad vehicles owned, operated, leased or 
otherwise under the control of a State or covered person acquired during 
waiver years are applicable towards the petroleum fuel reduction 
required in Sec. 490.803(a) of this subpart:
    (1) If acquisition of the nonroad vehicles leads directly to the 
establishment or upgrading of refueling or recharging infrastructure 
during a waiver year that would also allow for increased petroleum 
replacement by serving the fleet's on-road light-duty vehicles; and
    (2) To the extent that additional reductions attributable to motor 
vehicles are not reasonably available.
    (c) Rollover of excess petroleum reductions. (1) Petroleum 
reductions achieved by a fleet in excess of the amount required for 
alternative compliance in a previous model year are applicable towards 
the petroleum fuel reduction requirements for that fleet under Sec. 
490.803(a) of this subpart upon approval by DOE.
    (2) Requests for approval to apply rollover reductions to future 
model years for which a waiver is requested must be made to DOE in 
writing as part of the reporting requirement specified in Sec. 490.807 
of this subpart.
    (3) DOE will apply approved rollover reductions to a model year for 
which a waiver was granted but the required reduction in petroleum use 
was not achieved only to the extent that additional reductions 
attributable to motor vehicles were not reasonably available.
    (4) Following receipt of a request to roll over excess petroleum 
reduction, DOE notifies the State or covered person of the amount of 
petroleum reduction that may be applied to a future model year's 
petroleum reduction requirement.
    (5) Excess petroleum reductions are not tradable.
    (d) Ineligible reductions. The petroleum reduction plan required by 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section must not include reductions in 
petroleum attributable to incentives for third parties to reduce their 
petroleum use, petroleum reductions that are not transportation-related, 
or petroleum reductions attributable to non-qualified nonroad vehicles.

sought.
    (c) A waiver application must include verifiable data that is 
sufficient to enable DOE to determine whether the State or covered 
person is likely to achieve the amount of petroleum reduction required 
for alternative compliance and whether the fleet is in compliance with 
Clean Air Act vehicle emission standards. At a minimum, the State entity 
or covered person must provide DOE with the following information:
    (1) The model year for which the waiver is requested;
    (2) The total number of required alternative fueled vehicle 
acquisitions in the fleet including:
