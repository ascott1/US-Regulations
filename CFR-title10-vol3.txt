                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Sec. 202.21   Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart sets forth the procedures to be followed when a 
subpoena, order, or other demand (hereinafter referred to as a 
``demand'') of a court or other authority is issued for the production 
or disclosure of (1) any material contained in the files of the 
Department of Energy (DOE), (2) any information relating to material 
contained in the files of the DOE, or (3) any information or material 
acquired by any person while such person was an employee of the DOE as a 
part of the performance of his official duties or because of his 
official status.
    (b) For purposes of this subpart, the term ``Employee of the DOE'' 
includes all officers and employees of the United States appointed by, 
or subject to the supervision, jurisdiction, or control of, the 
Administrator of DOE.


<R05>
Sec. 202.22   Production or disclosure prohibited unless approved by appropriate DOE official.

    No employee or former employee of the DOE shall, in response to a 
demand of a court or other authority, produce any material contained in 
the file of the DOE or disclose any information relating to material 
contained in the files of the DOE, or disclose any information or 
produce any material acquired as part of the performance of his official 
duties or because of his official status without prior approval of the 
General Counsel of DOE.


<R05>
Sec. 202.23   Procedure in the event of a demand for production or disclosure.

    (a) Whenever a demand is made upon an employee or former employee of 
the DOE for the production of material or the disclosure of information 
described in Sec. 202.21(a), he shall immediately notify the Regional 
Counsel for the region where the issuing authority is located. The 
Regional Counsel shall immediately request instructions from the General 
Counsel of DOE.
    (b) If oral testimony is sought by the demand, an affidavit, or, if

Sec. 202.25   Procedure where a decision concerning a demand is not made prior to the time a response to the demand is required.

    If response to the demand is required before the instructions from 
the General Counsel are received, a U.S. attorney or DOE attorney 
designated for the purpose shall appear with the employee or former 
employee of the DOE upon whom the demand has been made, and shall 
furnish the court or other authority with a copy of the regulations 
contained in this subpart and inform the court or other authority that 
the demand has been, or is being, as the case may be, referred for the 
prompt consideration of the appropriate DOE official and shall 
respectfully request the court or authority to stay the demand pending 
receipt of the requested instructions.


<R05>
Sec. 202.26   Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling.

    If the court or other authority declines to stay the effect of the 
demand in response to a request made in accordance with Sec. 202.25 
pending receipt of instructions, of if the court or other authority 
rules that the demand must be complied with irrespective of instructions 
not to produce the material or disclose the information sought, the 
employee or former employee upon whom the demand has been made shall 
respectfully decline to comply with the demand. ``United States ex rel

notice of the document prior to the return date of the document.
    (d)(1) A witness subpoenaed by the DOE shall be paid the same fees

    (2) If in the course of a proceeding conducted pursuant to subpart M 
or O, a subpoena is issued at the request of a person other than an 
officer or agency of the United States, the witness fees and mileage 
shall be paid by the person who requested the subpoena. However, at the 
request of the person, the witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the

    (i) The presence of the subpoenaed witness will materially advance 
the proceeding; and
    (ii) The person who requested that the subpoena be issued would 
suffer a serious hardship if required to pay the witness fees and 
mileage. The DOE Official issuing the subpoena shall make the 
determination required by this subsection.

[[Page 12]]

    (e) If any person upon whom a subpoena or SRO is served pursuant to

District Court to enforce the subpoena or SRO.
    (f) (1) Documents produced in response to a subpoena shall be

furnished is true, complete, and correct unless withheld on grounds of 
privilege pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section.

with the subpoena or SRO.
    (g) If a person to whom a subpoena or SRO is directed withholds any 
document or information because of a claim of attorney-client or other 
privilege, the person submitting the certification required by paragraph 
(f) of this section also shall submit a written list of the documents or 
the information withheld indicating a description of each document or 
information, the date of the document, each person shown on the document 
as having received a copy of the document, each person shown on the 
document as having prepared or been sent the document, the privilege 
relied upon as the basis for withholding the document or information, 
and an identification of the person whose privilege is being asserted.
    (h)(1) If testimony is taken pursuant to a subpoena, the DOE 
Official shall determine whether the testimony shall be recorded and the 
means by which the testimony is recorded.

being considered or investigated by any DOE office, other Federal 
agency, department or instrumentality; or by a State Office, a state or 
municipal agency or court; or by any law enforcement agency; including, 
but not limited to, a consideration or investigation in connection with 
any proceeding described in this part. In addition, the person shall 
state whether contact has been made by the person or one acting on his 
behalf with any person who is employed by the DOE or any State Office 
with regard to the same issue, act or transaction or a related issue, 
act or transaction arising out of the same factual situation; the name 
of the person contacted; whether the contact was verbal or in writing; 
the nature and substance of the contact; and the date or dates of the 
contact.
    (f) Request for confidential treatment. (1) If any person filing a 
document with the DOE or a State Office claims that some or all the 
information contained in the document is exempt from the mandatory 
public disclosure requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (5 
U.S.C. 552 (1970)), is information referred to in 18 U.S.C. 1905 (1970), 
or is otherwise exempt by law from public disclosure, and if such person 
requests the DOE or a State Office not to disclose such information, 
such person shall file together wiht the document a second copy of the 
document from which has been deleted the information for which such 
person wishes to claim confidential treatment. The person shall indicate 
in the original document that it is confidential or contains 
confidential information and may file a statement specifying the 
justification for non-disclosure of the information for which 
confidential treatment is claimed. If the person states that the 
information comes within the exception in 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) for trade 
secrets and commercial or financial information, such person shall 
include a

[[Page 14]]

statement specifying why such information is privileged or confidential. 
If the person filing a document does not submit a second copy of the 
document with the confidential information deleted, the DOE or a State 
Office may assume that there is no objection to public disclosure of the 
document in its entirety.
    (2) The DOE or a State Office retains the right to make its own 
determination with regard to any claim of confidentiality. Notice of the 
decision by the DOE or a State Office to deny such claim, in whole or in 
part, and an opportunity to respond shall be given to a person claiming 
confidentiality of information no less than five days prior to its 
public disclosure.
    (g) Separate applications, petitions or requests. Each application, 
petition or request for DOE action shall be submitted as a separate 
document, even if the applications, petitions, or requests deal with the 
same or a related issue, act or transaction, or are submitted in 
connection with the same proceeding.

Sec. 205.80   Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart establishes the procedures for the filing of a 
formal request for an interpretation and for the consideration of such 
request. Responses, which may include verbal or written responses to 
general inquiries or to other than formal written requests for 
interpretation filed with the General Counsel or his delegate or a 
Regional Counsel, are not interpretations and merely provide general 
information.
    (b) A request for interpretation that includes, or could be 
construed to include an application for an exception or an exemption may 
be treated solely as a request for interpretation and processed as such.

Sec. 205.81   What to file.

    (a) A person filing under this subpart shall file a ``Request for 
Interpretation,'' which should be clearly labeled as such both on the

<R05>
Sec. 205.83   Contents.

    (a) The request shall contain a full and complete statement of all 
relevant facts pertaining to the circumstances,

[[Page 18]]

act or transaction that is the subject of the request and to the DOE 
action sought. Such facts shall include the names and addresses of all 
affected persons (if reasonably ascertainable) and a full discussion of 
the pertinent provisions and relevant facts contained in the documents 
submitted with the request. Copies of all relevant contracts, 
agreements, leases, instruments, and other documents shall be submitted 
with the request. When the request pertains to only one step of a larger 
integrated transaction, the facts, circumstances, and other relevant 
information pertaining to the entire transaction must be submitted.
    (b) The request for interpretation shall include a discussion of all 
relevant authorities, including, but not limited to, DOE rulings, 
regulations, interpretations and decisions on appeals and exceptions 
relied upon to support the particular interpretation sought therein.


<R05>
Sec. 205.84   DOE evaluation.

    (a) Processing. (1) The DOE may initiate an investigation of any 
statement in a request and utilize in its evaluation any relevant facts 
obtained by such investigation. The DOE may accept submissions from 
third persons relevant to any request for interpretation provided that 
the person making the request is afforded an opportunity to respond to 
all third person submissions. In evaluating a request for 
interpretation, the DOE may consider any other source of information. 
The DOE on its own initiative may convene a conference, if, in its 
discretion, it considers that such conference will advance its 
evaluation of the request.
    (2) The DOE shall issue its interpretation on the basis of the 
information provided in the request, unless that information is 
supplemented by other information brought to the attention of the 
General Counsel or a Regional Counsel during the proceeding. The 
interpretation shall, therefore, depend for its authority on the 
accuracy of the factual statement and may be relied upon only to the 
extent that the facts of the actual situation correspond to those upon 
which the interpretation was based.
    (3) If the DOE determines that there is insufficient information 
upon which to base a decision and if upon request additional information 
is not submitted by the person requesting the interpretation, the DOE 
may refuse to issue an interpretation.
    (b) Criteria. (1) The DOE shall base an interpretation on the FEA 
and EPAA and the regulations and published rulings of the DOE as applied 
to the specific factual situation.
    (2) The DOE shall take into consideration previously issued 
interpretations dealing with the same or a related issue.


<R05>
Sec. 205.85  Decision and effect.

    (a) An interpretation may be issued after consideration of the 
request for interpretation and other relevant information received or 
obtained during the proceeding.
    (b) The interpretation shall contain a statement of the information 
upon which it is based and a legal analysis of and conclusions regarding 
the application of rulings, regulations and other precedent to the 
situation presented in the request.
    (c) Only those persons to whom an interpretation is specifically 
addressed and other persons upon whom the DOE serves the interpretation 
and who are directly involved in the same transaction or act may rely 
upon it. No person entitled to rely upon an interpretation shall be 
subject to civil or criminal penalties stated in subpart P of this part 
for any act taken in reliance upon the interpretation, notwithstanding 
that the interpretation shall thereafter be declared by judicial or 
other competent authority to be invalid.
    (d) An interpretation may be rescinded or modified at any time. 
Rescission or modification may be effected by notifying persons entitled 
to rely on the interpretation that it is rescinded or modified. This 
notification shall include a statement of the reasons for the recision 
or modification and, in the case of a modification, a restatement of the 
interpretation as modified.
    (e) An interpretation is modified by a subsequent amendment to the 
regulations or ruling to the extent that it is

[[Page 19]]

inconsistent with the amended regulation or ruling.
    (f)(1) Any person aggrieved by an interpretation may submit a 
petition for reconsideration to the General Counsel within 30 days of 
service of the interpretation from which the reconsideration is sought. 
There has not been an exhaustion of administrative remedies until a 
period of 30 days from the date of service of the interpretation has 
elapsed without receipt by the General Counsel of a petition for 
reconsideration or, if a petition for reconsideration of the 
interpretation has been filed in a timely manner, until that petition 
has been acted on by the General Counsel. However, a petition to which 
the General Counsel does not respond within 60 days of the date of 
receipt thereof, or within such extended time as the General Counsel may 
prescribe by written notice to the petitioner concerned within that 60 
day period, shall be considered denied.
    (2) A petition for reconsideration may be summarily denied if--
    (i) It is not filed in a timely manner, unless good cause is shown; 
or
    (ii) It is defective on its face for failure to state, and to 
present facts and legal argument in support thereof, that the 
interpretation was erroneous in fact or in law, or that it was arbitrary 
or capricious.
    (3) The General Counsel may deny any petition for reconsideration if 
the petitioner does not establish that--
    (i) The petition was filed by a person aggrieved by an 
interpretation;
    (ii) The interpretation was erroneous in fact or in law; or
    (iii) The interpretation was arbitrary or capricious. The denial of 
a petition shall be a final order of which the petitioner may seek 
judicial review.

          Subpart M--Conferences, Hearings, and Public Hearings


<R05>
Sec. 205.170   Purpose and scope.

    This subpart establishes the procedures for requesting and 
conducting a DOE conference, hearing, or public hearing. Such 
proceedings shall be convened in the discretion of the DOE, consistent 
with the requirements of the FEAA.


<R05>
Sec. 205.171   Conferences.

    (a) The DOE in its discretion may direct that a conference be 
convened, on its own initiative or upon request by a person, when it 
appears that such conference will materially advance the proceeding. The 
determination as to who may attend a conference convened under this 
subpart shall be in the discretion of the DOE, but a conference will 
usually not be open to the public.
    (b) A conference may be requested in connection with any proceeding 
of the DOE by any person who might be aggrieved by that proceeding. The 
request may be made in writing or verbally, but must include a specific 
showing as to why such conference will materially advance the 
proceeding. The request shall be addressed to the DOE office that is 
conducting the proceeding.
    (c) A conference may only be convened after actual notice of the 
time, place, and nature of the conference is provided to the person who 
requested the conference.
    (d) When a conference is convened in accordance with this section, 
each person may present views as to the issue or issues involved. 
Documentary evidence may be presented at the conference, but will be 
treated as if submitted in the regular course of the proceedings. A 
transcript of the conference will not usually be prepared. However, the 
DOE in its discretion may have a verbatim transcript prepared.
    (e) Because a conference is solely for the exchange of views 
incident to a proceeding, there will be no formal reports or findings 
unless the DOE in its discretion determines that such would be 
advisable.


<R05>
Sec. 205.172   Hearings.

    (a) The DOE in its discretion may direct that a hearing be convened 
on its own initiative or upon request by a person, when it appears that 
such hearing will materially advance the proceedings. The determination 
as to who may attend a hearing convened under this subpart shall be in 
the discretion of DOE, but a hearing will usually not be open to the 
public. Where the hearing involves a matter arising under part 213, the 
Director of Oil Imports shall be notified as to its time and place, in 
order that he or his representative may present views as to the issue or 
issues involved.
    (b) A hearing may only be requested in connection with an 
application for an exception or an appeal. Such request may be by the 
applicant, appellant, or any other person who might be aggrieved by the 
DOE action sought. The request shall be in writing and shall include a 
specific showing as to why such hearing will materially advance the 
proceeding. The request shall be addressed to the DOE office that is 
considering the application for an exception or the appeal.
    (c) The DOE will designate an agency official to conduct the 
hearing, and will specify the time and place for the hearing.
    (d) A hearing may only be convened after actual notice of the time, 
place, and nature of the hearing is provided both to the applicant or 
appellant and to any other person readily identifiable by the DOE as one 
who will be aggrieved by the DOE action involved. The notice shall 
include, as appropriate:

[[Page 21]]

    (1) A statement that such person may participate in the hearing; or
    (2) A statement that such person may request a separate conference 
or hearing regarding the application or appeal.
    (e) When a hearing is convened in accordance with this section, each 
person may present views as to the issue or issues involved. Documentary 
evidence may be presented at the hearing, but will be treated as if 
submitted in the regular course of the proceedings. A transcript of the 
hearing will not usually be prepared. However, the DOE in its discretion 
may have a verbatim transcript prepared.
    (f) The official conducting the hearing may administer oaths and 
affirmations, rule on the presentation of information, receive relevant 
information, dispose of procedural requests, determine the format of the 
hearing, and otherwise regulate the course of the hearing.
    (g) Because a hearing is solely for the exchange of views incident 
to a proceeding, there will be no formal reports or findings unless the 
DOE in its discretion determines that such would be advisable.

    (1) When the proposed rule or regulation is likely to have a 
substantial impact on the Nation's economy or large numbers of 
individuals or businesses; or
    (2) When the DOE determines that a public hearing would materially 
advance the consideration of the issue. A public hearing may be 
requested by any interested person in connection with a rulemaking 
proceeding, but shall only be convened on the initiative of the DOE 
unless otherwise required by statute.
    (b) A public hearing may be convened incident to any proceeding when 
the DOE in its discretion determines that such public hearing would 
materially advance the consideration of the issue.
    (c) A public hearing may only be convened after publication of a 
notice in the Federal Register, which shall include a statement of the 
time, place, and nature of the public hearing.
    (d) Interested persons may file a request to participate in the 
public hearing in accordance with the instructions in the notice 
published in the Federal Register. The request shall be in writing and 
signed by the person making the request. It shall include a description 
of the person's interest in the issue or issues involved and of the 
anticipated content of the presentation. It shall also contain a 
statement explaining why the person would be an appropriate spokesperson 
for the particular view expressed.
    (e) The DOE shall appoint a presiding officer to conduct the public 
hearing. An agenda shall be prepared that shall provide, to the extent 
practicable, for the presentation of all relevant views by competent 
spokespersons.
    (f) A verbatim transcript shall be made of the hearing. The 
transcript, together with any written comments submitted in the course 
of the proceeding, shall be made available for public inspection and 
copying in the public docket room, as provided in Sec. 205.15.
    (g) The information presented at the public hearing, together with 
the written comments submitted and other relevant information developed 
during the course of the proceeding, shall provide the basis for the DOE 
decision.

<R05>
Sec. 205.190  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart establishes the procedures for determining the 
nature and extent of violations of the DOE regulations in parts 210, 
211, and 212 and the procedures for issuance of a Notice of Probable 
Violation, a Proposed Remedial Order, a Remedial Order, an Interim 
Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, a Remedial Order for Immediate 
Compliance, a Notice of Probable Disallowance, a Proposed Order of 
Disallowance, an Order of Disallowance, or a Consent Order. Nothing in 
these regulations shall affect the authority of DOE enforcement 
officials in coordination with the Department of Justice to initiate 
appropriate civil or criminal enforcement actions in court at any time.
    (b) When any report required by the ERA or any audit or 
investigation discloses, or the ERA otherwise discovers, that there is 
reason to believe a violation of any provision of this chapter, or any 
order issued thereunder, has occurred, is continuing or is about to 
occur, the ERA may conduct an inquiry to determine the nature and extent 
of the violation. A Remedial Order or Order of Disallowance may be 
issued thereafter by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. The ERA may 
commence enforcement proceedings by serving a Notice of Probable 
Violation, a Notice of Probable Disallowance, a Proposed Remedial Order, 
a Proposed Order of Disallowance, or an Interim Remedial Order for 
Immediate Compliance.
Sec. 205.191  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 205.192  Proposed remedial order.

    (a) If the ERA finds, after the 30-day or other period authorized 
for reply to the Notice of Probable Violation, that a violation has 
occurred, is continuing, or is about to occur, it may issue a Proposed 
Remedial Order, which shall set forth the relevant facts and law.
    (b) The ERA may issue a Proposed Remedial Order at any time it finds 
that a violation has occurred, is continuing, or is about to occur even 
if it has not previously issued a Notice of Probable Violation.
    (c) The ERA shall serve a copy of the Proposed Remedial Order upon 
the person to whom it is directed. The ERA shall promptly publish a 
notice in the Federal Register which states the person to whom the 
Proposed Remedial Order is directed, his address, and the products, 
dollar amounts, time period, and geographical area specified in the 
Proposed Remedial Order. The notice shall indicate that a copy of the 
Proposed Remedial Order with confidential information, if any, deleted 
may be obtained from the ERA and that within 15 days after the date of 
publication any aggrieved person may file a Notice of Objection with the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals of accordance with Sec. 205.193. The ERA 
shall mail copies of the Federal Register notice to all readily 
identifiable persons who are likely to be aggrieved by issuance of the 
Proposed Remedial Order as a final order.
    (d) The Proposed Remedial Order shall set forth the proposed 
findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which it is based. It shall 
also include a discussion of the relevant authorities which support the 
position asserted, including rules, regulations, rulings, 
interpretations and previous decisions issued by DOE or its predecessor 
agencies. The Proposed Remedial Order shall be accompaned by a 
declaration executed by the DOE employee primarily knowledgeable about 
the facts of the case stating that, to the best of declarant's knowledge 
and belief, the findings of fact are correct.
    (e) The ERA may amend or withdraw a Proposed Remedial Order at its 
discretion prior to the date of service of a Statement of Objections in 
that proceeding. The date of service of the amended documents shall be 
considered the date of service of the Proposed Remedial Order in 
calculating the time periods specified in this part 205.


<R05>
Sec. 205.192A  Burden of proof.

    (a) In a Proposed Remedial Order proceeding the ERA has the burden 
of establishing a prima facie case as to the validity of the findings of 
fact and conclusions of law asserted therein. The ERA shall be deemed to 
meet this burden by the service of a Proposed Remedial Order that meets 
the requirements of Sec. 205.192(d) and any supplemental information 
that may be made available under Sec. 205.193A.

[[Page 23]]

    (b) Once a prima facie case has been established, a person who 
objects to a finding of fact or conclusion of law in the Proposed 
Remedial Order has the burden of going forward with the evidence. 
Furthermore, the proponent of additional factual representations has the 
burden of going forward with the evidence.
    (c) Unless otherwise specified by the Director of the Office of 
Hearings and Appeals or his designee, the proponent of an order or a 
motion or additional factual representations has the ultimate burden of 
persuasion.


<R05>
Sec. 205.193  Notice of Objection.

    (a) Within 15 days after publication of the notice of a Proposed 
Remedial Order in the Federal Register any aggrieved person may file a 
Notice of Objection to the Proposed Remedial Order with the Office of 
Hearings and Appeals. The Notice shall be filed in duplicate, shall 
briefly describe how the person would be aggrieved by issuance of the 
Proposed Remedial Order as a final order and shall state the person's 
intention to file a Statement of Objections. No confidential information 
shall be included in a Notice of Objection. The DOE shall place one copy 
of the Notice in the Office of Hearings and Appeals Public Docket Room.
    (b) A person who fails to file a timely Notice of Objection shall be 
deemed to have admitted the findings of fact and conclusions of law as 
stated in the Proposed Remedial Order. If a Notice of Objection is not 
filed as provided by paragraph (a) of this section, the Proposed 
Remedial Order may be issued as a final order.
    (c) A person who files a Notice of Objection shall on the same day 
serve a copy of the Notice upon the person to whom the Proposed Remedial 
Order is directed, the DOE Office that issued the Proposed Remedial 
Order, and the DOE Assistant General Counsel for Administrative 
Litigation.
    (d) The Notice shall include a certification of compliance with the 
provisions of this section, the names and addresses of each person 
served with a copy of the Notice, and the date and manner of service.
    (e) If no person files a timely Notice of Objection, ERA may request 
the Office of Hearings and Appeals to issue the Proposed Remedial Order 
as a final Remedial Order.
    (f) In order to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to a 
Remedial Order proceeding, a person must file a timely Notice of 
Objection and Statement of Objections with the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals.


<R05>
Sec. 205.193A  Submission of ERA supplemental information.

    Within 20 days after service of a Notice of Objection to a Proposed 
Remedial Order the ERA may serve, upon the person to whom the Proposed 
Remedial Order was directed, supplemental information relating to the 
calculations and determinations which support the findings of fact set 
forth in the Proposed Remedial Order.


<R05>
Sec. 205.194  Participants; official service list.

    (a) Upon receipt of a Notice of Objection, the Office of Hearings 
and Appeals shall publish a notice in the Federal Register which states 
the person to whom the Proposed Remedial Order is directed, his address 
and the products, dollar amounts, time period, and geographical area 
specified in the Proposed Remedial Order. The notice shall state that 
any person who wishes to participate in the proceeding must file an 
appropriate request with the Office of Hearings and Appeals.
    (b) The Office that issued the Proposed Remedial Order and the 
person to whom the Order is directed shall be considered participants 
before the Office of Hearings and Appeals at all stages of an 
enforcement proceeding. Any other person whose interest may be affected 
by the proceeding may file a request to participate in the proceeding 
with the Office of Hearings and Appeals within 20 days after publication 
of the notice referred to in paragraph (a) of this section. The request 
shall contain
    (1) The person's name, address, and telephone number and similar 
information concerning his duly authorized representative, if any;
    (2) A detailed description of the person's interest in the 
proceeding;

[[Page 24]]

    (3) The specific reasons why the person's active involvement in the 
proceeding will substantially contribute to a complete resolution of the 
issues to be considered in the proceeding;
    (4) A statement of the position which the person intends to adopt in 
the proceeding; and
    (5) A statement of the particular aspects of the proceeding, e.g. 
oral argument, submission of briefs, or discovery, in which the person 
wishes to actively participate.
    (c) After considering the requests submitted pursuant to paragraph 
(b) of this section, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall determine 
those persons who may participate on an active basis in the proceeding 
and the nature of their participation. Participants with similar 
interests may be required to consolidate their submissions and to appear 
in the proceeding through a common representative.
    (d) Within 30 days after publication of the notice referred to in 
paragraph (a) of this section, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall 
prepare an official service list for the proceeding. Within the same 30 
day period the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall mail the official 
service list to all persons who filed requests to participate. For good 
cause shown a person may be placed on the official service list as a 
non-participant, for the receipt of documents only. An opportunity shall 
be afforded to participants to oppose the placement of a non-participant 
on the official service list.
    (e) A person requesting to participate after the period for 
submitting requests has expired must show good cause for failure to file 
a request within the prescribed time period.
    (f) The Office of Hearings and Appeals may limit the nature of a 
person's participation in the proceeding, if it finds that the facts 
upon which the person's request was based have changed or were incorrect 
when stated or that the person has not been actively participating or 
has engaged in disruptive or dilatory conduct. The action referred to in 
this provision shall be taken only after notice and an opportunity to be 
heard are afforded.


<R05>
Sec. 205.195  Filing and service of all submissions.

    (a)(1) Statements of Objections, Responses to such Statements, and 
any motions or other documents filed in connection with a proceeding 
shall meet the requirements of Sec. 205.9 and shall be filed with the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals in accordance with Sec. 205.4. Unless 
otherwise specified, any participant may file a response to a motion 
within five days of service.
    (2) All documents shall be filed in duplicate, unless they contain 
confidential information, in which case they must be filed in 
triplicate.
    (3) If a person claims that any portion of a document which he is 
filing contains confidential information, such information should be 
deleted from two of the three copies which are filed. One copy from 
which confidential information has been deleted will be placed in the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals Public Docket Room.
    (b)(1) Persons other than DOE offices shall on the date a submission 
is filed serve each person on the official service list. Service shall 
be made in accordance with Sec. 205.7 and may also be made by deposit in 
the regular United States mail, properly stamped and addressed, when 
accompanied by proof of service consisting of a certificate of counsel 
or an affidavit of the person making the service. If any filing arguably 
contains confidential information, a person may serve copies with the 
confidential information deleted upon all persons on the official 
service list except DOE offices, which shall be served both an original 
filing and one with deletions.
    (2) A DOE office shall on the date it files a submission serve all 
persons on the official service list, unless the filing arguably 
contains confidential information. In that case the DOE office shall 
notify the person to whom the information relates of the opportunity to 
identify and delete the confidential information. The DOE Office may 
delay the service of a submission containing arguably confidential 
information upon all persons other than the possessor of the 
confidential information and other DOE offices up to 14 days. The

[[Page 25]]

possessor of the confidential information shall serve the filing with 
any deletions upon all persons on the official service list within such 
time period.
    (c) Any filing made under this section shall include a certification 
of compliance by the filer with the provisions of this subpart. The 
person serving a document shall file a certificate of service, which 
includes the date and manner of service for each person on the official 
service list.


<R05>
Sec. 205.196  Statement of objections.

    (a) A person who has filed a Notice of Objection shall file a 
Statement of Objections to a Proposed Remedial Order within 40 days 
after service of the Notice of Objection. A request for an extension of 
time for filing must be submitted in writing and may be granted for good 
cause shown.
    (b) The Statement of Objections shall set forth the bases for the 
objections to the issuance of the Proposed Remedial Order as a final 
order, including a specification of the issues of fact or law which the 
person intends to contest in any further proceeding involving the 
compliance matter which is the subject of the Proposed Remedial Order. 
The Statement shall set forth the findings of fact contained in the 
Proposed Remedial Order which are alleged to be erroneous, the factual 
basis for such allegations, and any alternative findings which are 
sought. The Statement shall include a discussion of all relevant 
authorities which support the position asserted. The Statement may 
include additional factual representations which are not referred to in 
the Proposed Remedial Order and which the person contends are material 
and relevant to the compliance proceeding. For each additional factual 
representation which the person asserts should be made, the Statement 
shall include reasons why the factual representation is relevant and 
material, and the manner in which its validity is or will be 
established. The person shall also specify the manner in which each 
additional issue of fact was raised in any prior administrative 
proceeding which led to issuance of the Proposed Remedial Order, or the 
reasons why it was not raised.
    (c) A Statement of Objections that is filed by the person to whom a 
Proposed Remedial Order is directed shall include a copy of any relevant 
Notice of Probable Violation, each Response thereto, the Proposed 
Remedial Order, and any relevant work papers or supplemental information 
previously provided by ERA. Copies of this material must also be

DOE Assistant General Counsel for Administrative Litigation. All other 
persons on the official service list must be notified that such 
materials are available from the notifier upon written request.

    (a) Within 30 days after service of a Statement of Objections each 
participant may file a Response. If any motions are served with the 
Statement of Objections, a participant shall have 30 days from the date 
of service to respond to such submissions, notwithstanding any shorter 
time periods otherwise required in this subpart. The Response shall 
contain a full discussion of the position asserted and a discussion of 
the legal and factual bases which support that position. The Response 
may also contain a request that any issue of fact or law advanced in a 
Statement of Objections be dismissed. Any such request shall be 
accompanied by a full discussion of the reasons supporting the 
dismissal.
    (b) A participant may submit a Reply to any Response within 10 days 
after the date of service of the Response.


<R05>
Sec. 205.198  Discovery.

    (a) If a person intends to file a Motion for Discovery, he must file 
it at the same time that he files his Statement of Objections or at the 
same time he files his Response to a Statement of Objections, whichever 
is earlier. All Motions for Discovery and related filings must be served 
upon the person to whom the discovery is directed. If the person to whom 
the discovery is directed is not on the official service list, the

    (1) A person produce for inspection and photocopying non-privileged 
written material in his possession;
    (2) A person respond to written interrogatories;
    (3) A person admit to the genuineness of any relevant document or 
the truth of any relevant fact; or
    (4) The deposition of a material witness be taken.
    (c) A Motion for Discovery shall set forth the reasons why the 
particular discovery is necessary in order to obtain relevant and 
material evidence and shall explain why such discovery would not unduly 
delay the proceeding.
    (d) Within 20 days after a Motion for Discovery is served, a 
participant or a person to whom the discovery is directed may file a 
request that the Motion be denied in whole or in part, stating the 
reasons which support the request.
    (e) Discovery may be conducted only pursuant to an Order issued by 
the Office of Hearings and Appeals. A Motion for Discovery will be 
granted if it is concluded that discovery is necessary for the party to 
obtain relevant and material evidence and that discovery will not unduly 
delay the proceeding. Depositions will be permitted if a convincing 
showing is made that the participant cannot obtain the material sought 
through one of the other discovery means specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (f) The Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his 
designee may issue subpoenas in accordance with Sec. 205.8 in support of 
Discovery Orders, except that Sec. 205.8 (h)(2), (3), and (4) shall not 
apply to such subpoenas.
    (g) The Office of Hearings and Appeals may order that any direct 
expenses incurred by a person to produce evidence pursuant to a Motion 
for Discovery be charged to the person who filed the Motion.
    (h)(1) If a person fails to comply with an order relating to 
discovery, the Office of Hearings and Appeals may order appropriate 
sanctions.
    (2) It shall be the duty of aggrieved participants to request that

respect to discovery shall be subject to further administrative review 
or appeal only upon issuance of the determination referred to in 
Sec. 205.199B.


<R05>
Sec. 205.198A  Protective order.

    A participant who has unsuccessfully attempted in writing to obtain 
information that another participant claims is confidential may file a 
Motion for Discovery and Protective Order. This motion shall meet the 
requirements of Sec. 205.198 and shall specify the particular 
confidential information that the movant seeks and the reasons why the 
information is necessary to adequately present the movant's position in 
the proceeding. A copy of the written request for information, a 
certification concerning when and to whom it was served and a copy of 
the response, if any, shall be appended to the motion. The motion must 
give the possessor of the information notice that a Response to the 
Motion must be filed within ten days. The Response shall specify the 
safeguards, if any, that should be imposed if the information is ordered 
to be released. The Office of Hearings and Appeals may issue a 
Protective Order upon consideration of the Motion and the Response.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199  Evidentiary hearing.

    (a) Filing Requirements. At the time a person files a Statement of 
Objections he may also file a motion requesting an evidentiary hearing 
be convened. A motion requesting an evidentiary hearing may be filed by 
any other participant within 30 days after that participant is served 
with a Statement of Objections.
    (b) Contents of Motion for Evidentiary Hearing. A Motion for 
Evidentiary Hearing shall specify each disputed issue of fact and the 
bases for the alternative findings the movant asserts. The movant shall 
also describe the manner in which each disputed issue of fact was raised 
in any prior administrative proceeding which led to issuance of the 
Proposed Remedial Order, or why it was not raised. The movant shall with 
respect to each disputed or alternative finding of fact:

[[Page 27]]

    (1) As specifically as possible, identify the witnesses whose 
testimony is required;
    (2) State the reasons why the testimony of the witnesses is 
necessary; and
    (3) State the reasons why the asserted position can be effectively 
established only through the direct questioning of witnesses at an 
evidentiary hearing.
    (c) Response to Motion for Evidentiary Hearing. Within 20 days after 
service of any Motion for Evidentiary Hearing, the Office that issued 
the Proposed Remedial Order shall, and any other participant may file a 
Response with the Office of Hearings and Appeals. The Response shall 
specify:
    (1) Each particular factual representation which is accepted as 
correct for purposes of the proceeding;
    (2) Each particular factual representation which is denied;
    (3) Each particular factual representation which the participant is 
not in a position to accept or deny;
    (4) Each particular factual representation which is not accepted and 
the participant wishes proven by the submission of evidence;
    (5) Each particular factual representation which the participant is 
prepared to dispute through the testimony of witnesses or the submission 
of verified documents; and
    (6) Each particular factual representation which the participant 
asserts should be dismissed as immaterial or irrelevant.
    (d) Prehearing Conferences. After all submissions with respect to a 
Motion for Evidentiary Hearing are filed, the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals may conduct conferences or hearings to resolve differences of 
view among the participants.
    (e) Decision on Motion for Evidentiary Hearing. After considering 
all relevant information received in connection with the Motion, the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals shall enter an Order. In the Order the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals shall direct that an evidentiary hearing 
be convened if it concludes that a genuine dispute exists as to relevant 
and material issues of fact and an evidentiary hearing would 
substantially assist it in making findings of fact in an effective 
manner. If the Motion for Evidentiary Hearing is granted in whole or in 
part, the Order shall specify the parties to the hearing, any 
limitations on the participation of a party, and the issues of fact set 
forth for the evidentiary hearing. The Order may also require parties 
that have adopted similar positions to consolidate their presentations 
and to appear at the evidentiary hearing through a common 
representative. If the Motion is denied, the Order may allow the movant 
to file affidavits and other documents in support of his asserted 
findings of fact.
    (f) Review of Decision. The Order of the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals with respect to a Motion for Evidentiary Hearing shall be 
subject to further administrative review or appeal only upon issuance of 
the determination referred to in Sec. 205.199B.
    (g) Conduct of Evidentiary Hearing. All evidentiary hearings 
convened pursuant to this section shall be conducted by the Director of 
the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee. At any evidentiary 
hearing the parties shall have the opportunity to present material 
evidence which directly relates to a particular issue of fact set forth 
for hearing. The presiding officer shall afford the parties an 
opportunity to cross examine all witnesses. The presiding officer may 
administer oaths and affirmations, rule on objections to the 
presentation of evidence, receive relevant material, rule on any motion 
to conform the Proposed Remedial Order to the evidence presented, rule 
on motions for continuance, dispose of procedural requests, determine 
the format of the hearing, modify any order granting a Motion for 
Evidentiary Hearing, direct that written motions or briefs be provided 
with respect to issues raised during the course of the hearing, issue 
subpoenas, and otherwise regulate the conduct of the hearing. The 
presiding officer may take reasonable measures to exclude duplicative 
material from the hearing, and may place appropriate limitations on the 
number of witnesses that may be called by a party. The presiding officer 
may also require that evidence be submitted through affidavits or other 
documents if the direct testimony of witnesses will unduly delay the 
orderly

[[Page 28]]

progress of the hearing and would not contribute to resolving the issues 
involved in the hearing. The provisions of Sec. 205.8 which relate to 
subpoenas and witness fees shall apply to any evidentiary hearing, 
except that subsection Sec. 205.8(h) (2), (3), and (4) shall not apply.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199A  Hearing for the purpose of oral argument only.

    (a) A participant is entitled upon timely request to a hearing to 
present oral argument with respect to the Proposed Remedial Order, 
whether or not an evidentiary hearing is requested or convened. A 
participant's request shall normally be considered untimely, if made 
more than 10 days after service of a determination regarding any motion 
filed by the requestor or, if no motions were filed by him, if made 
after the date for filing his Reply or his Response to a Statement of 
Objections.
    (b) If an evidentiary hearing is convened, and a hearing for oral 
argument is requested, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall 
determine whether the hearing for oral argument shall be held in 
conjunction with the evidentiary hearing or at a separate time.
    (c) A hearing for the purpose of receiving oral argument will 
generally be conducted only after the issues involved in the proceeding 
have been delineated, and any written material which the Office of 
Hearings and Appeals has requested to supplement a Statement of 
Objections or Responses has been submitted. The presiding officer may 
require further written submissions in support of any position advanced 
or issued at the hearing, and shall allow responses any such 
submissions.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199B  Remedial order.

    (a) After considering all information received during the 
proceeding, the Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his 
designee may issue a final Remedial Order. The Remedial Order may adopt 
the findings and conclusions contained in the Proposed Remedial Order or 
may modify or rescind any such finding or conclusion to conform the 
Order to the evidence or on the basis of a determination that the 
finding or conclusion is erroneous in fact or law or is arbitrary or 
capricious. In the alternative, the Office of Hearings and Appeals may 
determine that no Remedial Order should be issued or may remand all or a 
portion of the Proposed Remedial Order to the issuing DOE office for 
further consideration or modification. Every determination made pursuant 
to this section shall state the relevant facts and legal bases 
supporting the determination.
    (b) The DOE shall serve a copy of any determination issued pursuant 
to paragraph (a) of this section upon the person to whom it is directed, 
any person who was served with a copy of the Proposed Remedial Order, 
the DOE office that issued the Proposed Remedial Order, the DOE 
Assistant General Counsel for Administrative Litigation and any other 
person on the official service list. Appropriate deletions may be made 
in the determinations to ensure that confidentiality of information 
protected from disclosure under 18 U.S.C. 1905 and 5 U.S.C. 552. A copy 
of the determination with appropriate deletions to protect confidential 
and proprietary data shall be placed in the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals Public Docket Room.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199C  Appeals of remedial order to FERC.

    (a) The person to whom a Remedial Order is issued by the Office of 
Hearings and Appeals may file an administrative appeal if the Remedial 
Order proceeding was initiated by a Notice of Probable Violation issued 
after October 1, 1977, or, in those situations in which no Notice of 
Probable Violation was issued, if the proceeding was initiated by a 
Proposed Remedial Order issued after October 1, 1977.
    (b) Any such appeal must be initiated within 30 days after service 
of the Order by giving written notice to the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals that the person to whom a Remedial Order is issued wishes to 
contest the Order.
    (c) The Office of Hearings and Appeals shall promptly advise the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission of its receipt of a notice 
described in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) The Office of Hearings and Appeals may, on a case by case basis, 
set reasonable time limits for the Federal

[[Page 29]]

Energy Regulatory Commission to complete its action on such an appeal 
proceeding.
    (e) In order to exhaust administrative remedies, a person who is 
entitled to appeal a Remedial Order issued by the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals must file a timely appeal and await a decision on the merits. 
Any Remedial Order that is not appealed within the 30-day period shall 
become effective as a final Order of the DOE and is not subject to 
review by any court.
Secs. 205.199D--205.199E  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 205.199F  Ex parte communications.

    (a) No person who is not employed or otherwise supervised by the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals shall submit ex parte communications to 
the Director or any person employed or otherwise supervised by the 
Office with respect to any matter involved in Remedial Order or Order of 
Disallowance proceedings.
    (1) Ex parte communications include any ex parte oral or written 
communications relative to the merits of a Proposed Remedial Order, 
Interim Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, or Proposed Order of 
Disallowance proceeding pending before the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals. The term shall not, however, include requests for status 
reports, inquiries as to procedures, or the submission of proprietary or 
confidential information. Notice that proprietary or confidential 
submissions have been made shall be given to all persons on the official 
service list.
    (b) If any communication occurs that violates the provisions of this 
section, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall promptly make the 
substance of the communication available to the public and serve a copy 
of a written communication or a memorandum summarizing an oral 
communication to all participants in the affected proceeding. The Office 
of Hearings and Appeals may also take any other appropriate action to 
mitigate the adverse impact to any person whose interest may be affected 
by the ex parte contact.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199G  Extension of time; Interim and Ancillary Orders.

    The Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee 
may permit upon motion any document or submission referred to in this 
subpart other than appeals to FERC to be amended or withdrawn after it 
has been filed or to be filed within a time period different from that 
specified in this subpart. The Director or his designee may upon motion 
or on his own initiative issue any interim or ancillary Orders, 
reconsider any determinations, or make any rulings or determinations 
that are deemed necessary to ensure that the proceedings specified in 
this subpart are conducted in an appropriate manner and are not unduly 
delayed.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199H  Actions not subject to administrative appeal.

    A Notice of Probable Violation, Notice of Proposed Disallowance, 
Proposed Remedial Order or Interim Remedial Order for Immediate 
Compliance issued pursuant to this subpart shall not be an action from 
which there may be an administrative appeal pursuant to subpart H. In 
addition, a determination by the Office of Hearings and Appeals that a 
Remedial Order, an Order of Disallowance, or a Remedial Order for 
Immediate Compliance should not be issued shall not be appealable 
pursuant to subpart H.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199I  Remedies.

    (a) A Remedial Order, a Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, an 
Order of Disallowance, or a Consent Order may require the person to whom 
it is directed to roll back prices, to make refunds equal to the amount 
(plus interest) charged in excess of those amounts permitted under DOE 
Regulations, to make appropriate compensation to third persons for 
administrative expenses of effectuating appropriate remedies, and to 
take such other action as the DOE determines is necessary to eliminate 
or to compensate for the effects of a violation or any cost disallowance 
pursuant to Sec. 212.83 or Sec. 212.84. Such action may include a 
direction to the person to whom the

[[Page 30]]

Order is issued to establish an escrow account or take other measures to 
make refunds directly to purchasers of the products involved, 
notwithstanding the fact that those purchasers obtained such products 
from an intermediate distributor of such person's products, and may 
require as part of the remedy that the person to whom the Order is 
issued maintain his prices at certain designated levels, notwithstanding 
the presence or absence of other regulatory controls on such person's 
prices. In cases where purchasers cannot be reasonably identified or 
paid or where the amount of each purchaser's overcharge is incapable of 
reasonable determination, the DOE may refund the amounts received in 
such cases directly to the Treasury of the United States on behalf of 
such purchasers.
    (b) The DOE may, when appropriate, issue final Orders ancillary to a 
Remedial Order, Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, Order of 
Disallowance, or Consent Order requiring that a direct or indirect 
recipient of a refund pass through, by such means as the DOE deems 
appropriate, including those described in paragraph (a) of this section, 
all or a portion of the refund, on a pro rata basis, to those customers 
of the recipient who were adversely affected by the initial overcharge. 
Ancillary Orders may be appealed to the Office of Hearings and Appeals 
only pursuant to subpart H.


<R05>
Sec. 205.199J  Consent order.

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, the DOE may 
at any time resolve an outstanding compliance investigation or 
proceeding, or a proceeding involving the disallowance of costs pursuant 
to Sec. 205.199E with a Consent Order. A Consent Order must be signed by 
the person to whom it is issued, or a duly authorized representative, 
and must indicate agreement to the terms contained therein. A Consent 
Order need not constitute an admission by any person that DOE 
regulations have been violated, nor need it constitute a finding by the 
DOE that such person has violated DOE regulations. A Consent Order 
shall, however, set forth the relevant facts which form the basis for 
the Order.
    (b) A Consent Order is a final Order of the DOE having the same 
force and effect as a Remedial Order issued pursuant to Sec. 205.199B or 
an Order of Disallowance issued pursuant to Sec. 205.199E, and may 
require one or more of the remedies authorized by Sec. 205.199I and 
Sec. 212.84(d)(3). A Consent Order becomes effective no sooner than 30 
days after publication under paragraph (c) of this section, unless (1) 
the DOE makes a Consent Order effective immediately, because it 
expressly deems it necessary in the public interest, or (2) the Consent 
Order involves a sum of less than $500,000 in the aggregate, excluding 
penalties and interest, in which case it will be effective when signed 
both by the person to whom it is issued and the DOE, and will not be 
subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section unless the 
DOE determines otherwise. A Consent Order shall not be appealable 
pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 205.199C or Sec. 205.199D and subpart 
H, and shall contain an express waiver of such appeal or judicial review 
rights as might otherwise attach to a final Order of the DOE.
    (c) When a Consent Order has been signed, both by the person to whom 
it is issued and the DOE, the DOE will publish notice of such Consent 
Order in the Federal Register and in a press release to be issued 
simultaneously therewith. The Federal Register notice and the press 
release will state at a minimum the name of the company concerned, a 
brief summary of the Consent Order and other facts or allegations 
relevant thereto, the address and telephone number of the DOE office at 
which copies of the Consent Order will be available free of charge, the 
address to which comments on the Consent Order will be received by the 
DOE, and the date by which such comments should be submitted, which date 
will not be less than 30 days after publication of the Federal Register 
notice. After the expiration of the comment period the DOE may withdraw 
its agreement to the Consent Order, attempt to negotiate a modification 
of the Consent Order, or issue the Consent Order as signed. The DOE will 
publish in the Federal Register, and by press release, notice of any 
action taken on a Consent Order and such explanation of

[[Page 31]]

the action taken as deemed appropriate. The provisions of this paragraph 
shall be applicable notwithstanding the fact that a Consent Order may 
have been made immediately effective pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section (except in cases where the Consent Order involves sums of less 
than $500,000 in the aggregate, excluding penalties and interest).
    (d) At any time and in accordance with the procedures of subpart J, 
a Consent Order may be modified or rescinded, upon petition by the 
person to whom the Consent Order was issued, and may be rescinded by the 
DOE upon discovery of new evidence which is materially inconsistent with 
evidence upon which the DOE's acceptance of the Consent Order was based. 
Modifications of a Consent Order which is subject to public comment 
under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, which in the 
opinion of the DOE significantly change the terms or the impact of the 
original Order, shall be republished under the provisions of that 
paragraph.
    (e) Notwithstanding the issuance of a Consent Order, the DOE may 
seek civil or criminal penalties or compromise civil penalties pursuant 
to subpart P concerning matters encompassed by the Consent Order, unless 
the Consent Order by its terms expressly precludes the DOE from so 
doing.
    (f) If at any time after a Consent Order becomes effective it 
appears to the DOE that the terms of the Consent Order have been 
violated, the DOE may refer such violations to the Department of Justice 
for appropriate action in accordance with subpart P.

Sec. 205.280  Purpose and scope.

    This subpart establishes special procedures pursuant to which 
refunds may be made to injured persons in order to remedy the effects of 
a violation of the regulations of the Department of Energy. This subpart 
shall be applicable

[[Page 33]]

to those situations in which the Department of Energy is unable to 
readily identify persons who are entitled to refunds specified in a 
Remedial Order, a Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, an Order of 
Disallowance or a Consent Order, or to readily ascertain the amounts 
that such persons are entitled to receive.


<R05>
Sec. 205.281  Petition for implementation of special refund procedures.

    (a) At any time after the issuance of a Remedial Order (including 
for purposes of this subpart a Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance 
and an Order of Disallowance), or a Consent Order, the Special Counsel 
of the Department of Energy, the ERA Office of Enforcement, or any other 
enforcement official of the Department of Energy may file with the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals a Petition for the Implementation of 
Special Refund Procedures.
    (b) The Petition shall state that the person filing it has been 
unable readily either to identify the persons who are entitled to 
refunds to be remitted pursuant to a Remedial Order or a Consent Order 
or to ascertain the amounts of refunds that such persons are entitled to 
receive. The Petition shall request that the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals institute appropriate proceedings under this Subpart to 
distribute the funds referred to in the enforcement documents.
    (c) The Petition shall contain a copy of each relevant enforcement 
document, shall be filed in duplicate, and shall meet the requirements 
of Sec. 205.9 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 205.282  Evaluation of petition by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.

    (a) After considering the Petition, the Director of the Office of 
Hearings and Appeals or his designee shall issue a Proposed Decision and 
Order. The Proposed Decision and Order shall generally describe the 
nature of the particular refund proceeding and shall set forth the 
standards and procedures that the Office of Hearings and Appeals intends 
to apply in evaluating refund claims.
    (b) The Proposed Decision and Order shall be published in the 
Federal Register together with a statement that any member of the public 
may submit written comments to the Office of Hearings and Appeals with 
respect to the matter. At least 30 days following publication in the 
Federal Register shall be provided for the submission of comments.
    (c) After considering the comments submitted, the Director of the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee shall issue a final 
Decision and Order which shall govern the disposition of the refunds. 
The final Decision and Order shall also be published in the Federal 
Register.
    (d) The final Decision and Order shall set forth the standards and 
procedures that will be used in evaluating individual Applications for 
Refunds and distributing the refund amount. Those standards and 
procedures shall be consistent with the provisions of this subpart.
    (e) In establishing standards and procedures for implementing refund 
distributions, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall take into 
account the desirability of distributing the refunds in an efficient, 
effective and equitable manner and resolving to the maximum extent 
practicable all outstanding claims. In order to do so, the standards for 
evaluation of individual claims may be based upon appropriate 
presumptions.


<R05>
Sec. 205.283  Applications for refund.

    (a) Any person entitled to a refund pursuant to a final Decision and 
Order issued pursuant to Sec. 205.282 may file an Application for 
Refund. All Applications must be signed by the applicant and specify the 
DOE order to which they pertain. Any Application for a refund in excess 
of $100 must be file in duplicate, and a copy of that Application will 
be available for public inspection in the DOE Public Docket Room at 2000 
M Street, NW., Washington, DC. Any applicant who believes that his 
Application contains confidential information must so indicate on the 
first page of his Application and submit two additional copies of his 
Application from which the information that the applicant claims is 
confidential has

[[Page 34]]

been deleted, together with a statement specifying why any such 
information is privileged or confidential.
    (b) The contents of an Application for Refund shall be specified in 
the final Decision and Order referred to in Sec. 205.282(c). A filing 
deadline for Applications shall also be specified in the final Decision 
and Order, and shall be no less than 90 days after the publication of 
the Order in the Federal Register.
    (c) Each Application shall be in writing and signed by the 
applicant, and shall indicate whether the applicant or any person acting 
on his instructions has filed or intends to file any other Application 
or claim of whatever nature regarding the matters at issue in the 
underlying enforcement proceeding. Each Application shall also include a

Sec. 205.284  Processing of applications.

    (a) The Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals may appoint 
an administrator to evaluate Applications under guidelines established 
by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. The administrator, if he is not a 
Federal Government employee, may be compensated from the funds referred 
to in the Remedial Order or Consent Order. The administrator may design 
and distribute an optional application form for the convenience of the 
applicants.
    (b) The Office of Hearings and Appeals or its designee may initiate 
an investigation of any statement made in an Application and may require 
verification of any document submitted in support of a claim. In 
evaluating an Application, the Office of Hearings and Appeals or its 
designee may solicit and consider information obtained from any source 
and may on its own initiative convene a hearing or conference, if it 
determines that a hearing or conference will advance its evaluation of 
an Application.
    (c) The Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his 
designee shall conduct any hearing or conference convened with respect 
to an Application for Refund and shall specify the time and place for 
the hearing or conference and notify the applicant. The official 
conducting the hearing may administer oaths and affirmations, rule on 
the presentation of information, receive relevant information, dispose 
of procedural requests, determine the format of the hearing and 
otherwise regulate the course of the hearing. The provisions of 
Sec. 205.8 of this part which relate to subpoenas and witness fees shall 
apply to any hearing convened with respect to an application for refund, 
except that Sec. 205.8(h) (2), (3) and (4) shall not apply.
    (d) Upon consideration of an Application and other relevant 
information received during the course of a refund proceeding, the 
Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee shall 
issue an order granting or denying the Application. The order shall 
contain a concise statement of the relevant facts and the legal basis 
for the order. A copy of the order, with such modification as is

public disclosure by 18 U.S.C. 1905, may be obtained upon request by an 
applicant or any other person who participated in the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 205.285  Effect of failure to file a timely application.

    An Application for Refund must be filed no later than the date that 
the Office of Hearings and Appeals establishes pursuant to 
Sec. 205.283(b). Any Application that is not filed on a timely basis may 
be summarily dismissed. The Office of Hearings and Appeals or its 
designee may, however, grant extensions of time for good cause shown. 
Any request for an extension of time must generally be submitted in 
writing prior to the deadline.


<R05>
Sec. 205.286  Limitations on amount of refunds.

    (a) The aggregate amount of all refunds approved by the Office of 
Hearings and Appeals or its designee in a given case shall not exceed 
the amount to be remitted pursuant to the relevant DOE enforcement 
order, plus any accumulated interest, reduced by the amount of any 
administrative costs approved by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. In 
the event that the aggregate amount of approved claims exceeds the 
aggregate amount of funds

[[Page 35]]

specified above, the Office of Hearings and Appeals may make refunds on 
a pro rata basis. The Office of Hearings and Appeals may delay payment 
of any refunds until all Applications have been processed.
    (b) The Office of Hearings and Appeals may decline to consider 
Applications for refund amounts that, in view of the direct 
administrative costs involved, are too small to warrant individual 
consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 205.287  Escrow accounts, segregated funds and other guarantees.

    (a) In implementing the refund procedures specified in this subpart, 
the Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee shall 
issue an order providing for the custody of the funds to be tendered 
pursuant to the Remedial Order or Consent Order. This Order may require 
placement of the funds in an appropriate interest-bearing escrow 
account, retention of the funds by the firm in a segregated account 
under such terms and conditions as are specified by the DOE, or the 
posting of a sufficient bond or other guarantee to ensure payment.
    (b) All costs and charges approved by the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals and incurred in connection with the processing of Applications 
for Refund or incurred by an escrow agent shall be paid from the amount 
of funds, including any accumulated interest, to be remitted pursuant to 
the Remedial Order or Consent Order.
    (c) After the expenses referred to in paragraph (b) of this section 
have been satisfied and refunds distributed to successful applicants, 
any remaining funds remitted pursuant to the Remedial Order or Consent 
Order shall be deposited in the United States Treasury or distributed in 
any other manner specified in the Decision and Order referred to in 
Sec. 205.282(c).
    (d) Funds contained in an escrow account, segregated fund, or 
guaranteed by other approved means shall be disbursed only upon written 
order of the Office of Hearings and Appeals.


<R05>
Sec. 205.288  Interim and ancillary orders.

    The Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee 
may issue any interim or ancillary orders, or make any rulings or 
determinations to ensure that refund proceedings, including the actions

<R05>
Sec. 205.328  Environmental requirements for Presidential Permits--Alternative 1.

    (a) NEPA Compliance. Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (e) of 
this section, when an applicant seeks a Presidential Permit, such 
applicant will be responsible for the costs of preparing any necessary 
environmental document, including an Environmental Impact Statement 
(EIS), arising from ERA's obligation to comply with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). ERA will determine whether an 
environmental assessment (EA) or EIS is required within 45 days of the 
receipt of the Presidential Permit application and of environmental 
information submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 205.322 (c) and (d). ERA will 
use these and other sources of information as the basis for making the 
environmental determination:
    (1) If an EIS is determined to be necessary, the applicant shall 
enter into a contract with an independent third party, which may be a 
Government-owned, contractor-operated National Laboratory, or a 
qualified private entity selected by ERA. The third party contractor 
must be qualified to conduct an environmental review and prepare an EIS, 
as appropriate, under the supervision of ERA, and may not have a 
financial or other interest in the outcome of the proceedings. The NEPA 
process must be completed and approved before ERA will issue a 
Presidential Permit.
    (2) If an EA is determined to be necessary, the applicant may be 
permitted to prepare an environmental assessment pursuant to 10 CFR 
1506.5(b) for review and adoption by ERA, or the applicant may enter 
into a third party contract as set forth in this section.
    (b) Environmental Review Procedure. Except as provided in paragraphs 
(c) and (e) of this section, environmental documents, including the EIS, 
where necessary, will be prepared utilizing the process set forth above. 
ERA, the applicant, and the independent third party, which may be a 
Government-owned, contractor-operated National Laboratory or a private 
entity, shall enter into an agreement in which the applicant will engage 
and pay directly for the services of the qualified third party to 
prepare the necessary environmental documents. The agreement shall 
outline the responsibilities of each party and its relationship to the 
other two parties regarding the work to be done or supervised. ERA shall 
approve the information to be developed and supervise the gathering, 
analysis

[[Page 41]]

and presentation of the information. In addition, ERA will have the 
authority to approve and modify any statement, analysis, and conclusion 
contained in the environmental documents prepared by the third party. 
Before commencing preparation of the environmental document the third 
party will execute an ERA-prepared disclosure document stating that it 
does not have any conflict of interest, financial or otherwise, in the 
outcome of either the environmental process or the Permit application.
    (c) Financial Hardship. Whenever ERA determines that a project is no 
longer economically feasible, or that a substantial financial burden 
would be imposed by the applicant bearing all of the costs of the NEPA 
studies, ERA may waive the requirement set forth in paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section and perform the necessary environmental review, 
completely or in part, with its own resources.
    (d) Discussions Prior to Filing. Prior to the preparation of any 
Presidential Permit application and environmental report, a potential 
applicant is encouraged to contact ERA and each affected State public 
utility regulatory agency to discuss the scope of the proposed project 
and the potential for joint State and Federal environmental review.
    (e) Federal Exemption. Upon a showing by the applicant that it is 
engaged in the transaction of official business of the Federal 
Government in filing the application pursuant to 10 CFR 205.320 et seq., 
it will be exempt from the requirements of this section.

financially responsible for the expenses of any contractor chosen by ERA 
to prepare any necessary environmental document arising from ERA's 
obligation to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
(NEPA) in issuing such Presidential Permits:
    (1) ERA will determine whether an Environmental Impact Statement 
(EIS) or an Environmental Assessment (EA) is required within 45 days of 
receipt of the Presidential Permit application and of the environmental 
information submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 205.322 (c) and (d). ERA will 
use these and other sources of information as the basis for making the 
environmental determination.
    (2) If an EIS is determined to be necessary, ERA will notify the 
applicant of the fee for completing the EIS within 90 days after the 
submission of the application and environmental information. The fee 
shall be based on the expenses estimated to be incurred by DOE in 
contracting to prepare the EIS (i.e., the estimated fee charges to ERA 
by the contractor). DOE employee salaries and other fixed costs, as set 
forth in OMB Circular A-25, shall not be included in the applicant's 
fee. Fee payment shall be by check, draft, or money order payable to the 
Treasurer of the United States, and shall be submitted to ERA. Upon 
submission of fifty percent of the environmental fee, ERA will provide 
to the applicant a tentative schedule for completion of the EIS.
    (3) If an EA is determined to be necessary, the applicant may be 
permitted to prepare an environmental assessment pursuant to 40 CFR 
1506.5(b) for review and adoption by ERA, or the applicant may choose to 
have ERA prepare the EA pursuant to the fee procedures set forth above.
    (4) The NEPA process must be completed and approved before ERA will 
issue a Presidential Permit.
    (b) Financial Hardship. Whenever ERA determines that a project is no 
longer economically feasible, or that a substantial financial burden 
would be imposed by the applicant bearing all of the costs of the NEPA 
studies, ERA may waive the requirement set forth in paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section and perform the necessary environmental review, 
completely or in part, with its own resources.
    (c) Discussions Prior to Filing. Prior to the preparation of any 
Presidential Permit application and environmental

[[Page 42]]

assessment, a potential applicant is encouraged to contact ERA and each 
affected State public utility regulatory agency to discuss the scope of 
the proposed project and the potential for joint State and Federal 
environmental review.
    (d) Fee Payment. The applicant shall make fee payment for completing 
the EIS to ERA in the following manner:
    (1) 50 percent of the total amount due to be paid within 30 days of 
receipt of the fee information from DOE;
    (2) 25 percent to be paid upon publication of the draft EIS; and
    (3) 25 percent to be paid upon publication of the final EIS.

If costs are less than the amount collected, ERA will refund to the 
applicant the excess fee collected. If costs exceed the initial fee, ERA 
will fund the balance, unless the increase in costs is caused by actions 
or inactions of the applicant, such as the applicant's failure to submit 
necessary environmental information in a timely fashion. If the 
application is withdrawn at any stage prior to issuance of the final 
EIS, the fee will be adjusted to reflect the costs actually incurred; 
payment shall be made by the applicant within 30 days of above 
referenced events.
    (e) Federal Exemption. Upon a showing by the applicant that it is 
engaged in the transaction of official business of the Federal 
Government in filing an application pursuant to 10 CFR 205.320 et seq., 
it will be exempt from the requirements of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 205.370  Applicability.

    Sections 202(c) and 202(d) of the Federal Power Act are applicable 
to any ``entity'' which owns or operates electric power generation, 
transmission or distribution facilities. An ``entity'' is a private or 
public corporation (utility), a governmental agency, a municipality, a 
cooperative or a lawful association of the foregoing. Under this 
section, the DOE has the authority to order the temporary connection of 
facilities, or the generation or delivery of electricity, which it deems 
necessary to alleviate an emergency. Such orders shall be effective for 
the time specified and will be subject to the terms and conditions the 
DOE specifies. The DOE retains the right to cancel, modify or otherwise 
change any order, with or without notice, hearing, or report. Requests 
for action under these regulations will be accepted from any ``entity,'' 
State Public Utility Commission, State Energy Agency, or State Governor. 
Actions under these regulations also may be initiated by the DOE on its 
own motion. Orders under this authority may be made effective without 
prior notice.


<R05>
Sec. 205.371  Definition of emergency.

    ``Emergency,'' as used herein, is defined as an unexpected 
inadequate supply of electric energy which may result from the 
unexpected outage or breakdown of facilities for the generation, 
transmission or distribution of electric power. Such events may be the 
result of weather conditions, acts of God, or unforeseen occurrences not 
reasonably within the power of the affected ``entity'' to prevent. An 
emergency also can result from a sudden increase in customer demand, an 
inability to obtain adequate amounts of the necessary fuels to generate 
electricity, or a regulatory action which prohibits the use of certain 
electric power supply facilities. Actions under this authority are 
envisioned as meeting a specific inadequate power supply situation. 
Extended periods of insufficient power supply as a result of inadequate 
planning or the failure to construct necessary facilities can result in 
an emergency as contemplated in these regulations. In such cases, the 
impacted ``entity'' will be expected to make firm arrangements to 
resolve the problem until new facilities become available, so that a 
continuing emergency order is not needed. Situations where a shortage of 
electric energy is projected due solely to the failure of parties to 
agree to terms, conditions or other economic factors relating to 
service, generally will not be considered as emergencies unless the 
inability to supply electric service is imminent. Where an electricity 
outage or service inadequacy qualifies for a section 202(c) order, 
contractual difficulties alone will not be sufficient to preclude the 
issuance of an emergency order.


<R05>
Sec. 205.372  Filing procedures; number of copies.

    An original and two conformed copies of the applications and reports 
required under Secs. 205.370 through 205.379 shall be filed with the

<R05>
Sec. 205.374  Responses from ``entities'' designated in the application.

    Each ``entity'' designated as a potential source of emergency 
assistance or as a potential supplier of transmission services and which 
has received a copy of the application under Sec. 205.373, shall have 
three (3) calendar days from the time of receipt of the application to 
file the information designated below with the DOE. The DOE will grant 
extensions of the filing period when appropriate. The designated 
``entities'' shall provide an analysis of the impact the requested 
action would have on its system reliability and its ability to supply 
its own interruptible and firm customers. The effects of the requested 
action on the ability to serve firm loads shall be clearly distinguished 
from the ability to serve contractually interruptible loads. The 
designated ``entity'' also may provide other information relevant to the 
requested action, which is not included in the reliability analysis. 
Copies of any response shall be provided to the applicant, the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission, any State Regulatory Agency having 
responsibility for service standards or rates of any ``entity'' that may 
be directly involved in the proposed action, and the appropriate 
Regional Electric Reliability Council. Pursuant to section 202(c) of the 
Federal Power Act, DOE may issue an emergency order even though a 
designated ``entity'' has failed to file a timely response.


<R05>
Sec. 205.375  Guidelines defining inadequate fuel or energy supply.

    An inadequate utility system fuel inventory or energy supply is a 
matter of managerial and engineering judgment based on such factors as 
fuels in stock, fuels en route, transportation time, and constraints on 
available storage facilities. A system may be considered to have an 
inadequate fuel or energy supply capability when, combined with other 
conditions, the projected energy deficiency upon the applicant's system 
without emergency action by the DOE, will equal or exceed 10 percent of 
the applicant's then normal daily net energy for load, or will cause the 
applicant to be unable to meet its normal peak load requirements based 
upon use of all of its otherwise available resources so that it is 
unable to supply adequate electric service to its ultimate customers. 
The following conditions will be considered in determining that a system 
has inadequate fuel or energy supply capability:
    (1) System coal stocks are reduced to 30 days (or less) of normal 
burn days and a continued downward trend in stock is projected;
    (2) System residual oil stocks are reduced to 15 days (or less) of 
normal burn days and a continued downward trend in stocks is projected;
    (3) System distillate oil stocks which cannot be replaced by 
alternate fuels are reduced to 15 days (or less) of normal burn days and 
a continued downward trend in stocks is projected;
    (4) System natural gas deliveries which cannot be replaced by 
alternate fuels have been or will be reduced 20 percent below normal 
requirements and no improvement in natural gas deliveries is projected 
within 30 days;
    (5) Delays in nuclear fuel deliveries will extend a scheduled 
refueling shutdown by more than 30 days; and
    (6) Water supplies required for power generation have been reduced 
to the level where the future adequacy of the power supply may be 
endangered and no near term improvement in water supplies is projected.

The use of the prescribed criteria does not preclude an applicant from 
claiming the existence of an emergency when its stocks of fuel or water 
exceed the amounts and time frames specified above.


<R05>
Sec. 205.376  Rates and charges.

    The applicant and the generating or transmitting systems from which 
emergency service is requested are encouraged to utilize the rates and 
charges contained in approved existing

[[Page 47]]

rate schedules or to negotiate mutually satisfactory rates for the 
proposed transactions. In the event that the DOE determines that an 
emergency exists under section 202(c), and the ``entities'' are unable 
to agree on the rates to be charged, the DOE shall prescribe the 
conditions of service and refer the rate issues to the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission for determination by that agency in accordance 
with its standards and procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 205.377  Reports.

    In addition to the information specified below, the DOE may require 
additional reports as it deems necessary.
    (a) Where the DOE has authorized the temporary connection of 
transmission facilities, all ``entities'' whose transmission facilities 
are thus temporarily interconnected shall report the following 
information to the DOE within 15 days following completion of the 
interconnection:
    (1) The date the temporary interconnection was completed;
    (2) The location of the interconnection;
    (3) A description of the interconnection; and
    (4) A one-line electric diagram of the interconnection.
    (b) Where the DOE orders the transfer of power, the ``entity'' 
receiving such service shall report the following information to the DOE 
by the 10th of each month for the preceding month's activity for as long 
as such order shall remain in effect:
    (1) Amounts of capacity and/or energy received each day;
    (2) The name of the supplier;
    (3) The name of any ``entity'' supplying transmission services; and
    (4) Preliminary estimates of the associated costs.
    (c) Where the DOE has approved the installation of permanent 
facilities that will be used only during emergencies, any use of such 
facilities shall be reported to the DOE within 24 hours. Details of such 
usage shall be furnished as deemed appropriate by the DOE after such 
notification.
    (d) Any substantial change in the information provided under 
Sec. 205.373 shall be promptly reported to the DOE.

Sec. 205.378  Disconnection of temporary facilities.

    Upon the termination of any emergency for the mitigation of which 
the DOE ordered the construction of temporary facilities, such 
facilities shall be disconnected and any temporary construction removed 
or otherwise disposed of, unless application is made as provided in 
Sec. 205.379 for permanent connection for emergency use. This 
disconnection and removal of temporary facilities shall be accomplished 
within 30 days of the termination of the emergency unless an extension 
is granted by the DOE. The DOE shall be notified promply when such 
removal of facilities is completed.


<R05>
Sec. 205.379  Application for approval of the installation of permanent facilities for emergency use only.

    Application for DOE approval of a permanent connection for emergency 
use only shall conform with the requirements in Sec. 205.373. However, 
the baseline data specified in Sec. 205.373(d) need not be included in 
an application made under this section. In addition, the application 
shall state in full the reasons why such permanent connection for 
emergency use is in the public interest.

ESECA.
    (f) For the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any energy 
information requested, acquired, or collected by the DOE, the 
Administrator, or any officer or employee duly designated by him, upon 
presenting appropriate credentials and a written notice from the 
Administrator to the owner, operator, or agent in charge, may--
    (1) Enter, at reasonable times, any business premise of facility; 
and
    (2) Inspect, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, any 
such premise or facility, inventory and sample any stock of energy 
resources therein, and examine and copy books, records, papers, or other 
documents, relating to any such energy information.

<R05>
Sec. 207.4   Confidentiality of energy information.

    (a) Information obtained by the DOE under authority of ESECA shall 
be available to the public in accordance with the provisions of part 202 
of this chapter. Upon a showing satisfactory to the Administrator by any 
person that any energy information obtained under this subpart from such 
person would, if made public, divulge methods or processes entitled to 
protection as trade secrets or other proprietary information of such 
person, such information, or portion thereof, shall be deemed 
confidential in accordance with the provisions of section 1905 of title 
18, United States Code; except that such information, or part thereof, 
shall not be deemed confidential pursuant to that section for purposes 
of disclosure, upon request, to (1) any delegate of the DOE for the 
purpose of carrying out ESECA or the EPAA, (2) the Attorney General, the 
Secretary of the Interior, the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal 
Power Commission, or the General Accounting Office, when necessary to 
carry out those agencies' duties and responsibilities under ESECA and 
other statutes, and (3) the Congress, or any Committee of Congress upon 
request of the Chairman.
    (b) Whenever the Administrator requests reports of energy 
information under this subpart, he may specify (in the rule, order or 
questionnaire or other means by which he has requested such reports) the 
nature of the showing required to be made in order to satisfy DOE that 
certain energy information contained in such reports warrants 
confidential treatment in accordance with this section. He shall, to the 
maximum extent practicable, either before or after requesting reports, 
by ruling or otherwise, inform respondents providing energy information 
pursuant to this subpart of whether such information will be made 
available to the public pursuant to requests under the Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).


<R05>
Sec. 207.5   Violations.

    Any practice that circumvents or contravenes or results in a 
circumvention or contravention of the requirements of any provision of 
this subpart or any order issued pursuant thereto is a violation of the 
DOE regulations stated in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 207.6   Notice of probable violation and remedial order.

    (a) Purpose and scope. (1) This section establishes the procedures 
for determining the nature and extent of violations of this subpart and 
the procedures for issuance of a notice of probable violation, a 
remedial order or a remedial order for immediate compliance.
    (2) When the DOE discovers that there is reason to believe a 
violation of any provision of this subpart, or any order issued 
thereunder, has occurred, is continuing or is about to occur, the DOE 
may conduct proceedings to determine the nature and extent of the 
violation and may issue a remedial order thereafter. The DOE may 
commence such proceeding by serving a notice of probable violation or by 
issuing a remedial order for immediate compliance.
    (b) Notice of probable violation. (1) The DOE may begin a proceeding 
under this subpart by issuing a notice of probable

[[Page 50]]

violation if the DOE has reason to believe that a violation has 
occurred, is continuing, or is about to occur.
    (2) Within 10 days of the service of a notice of probable violation, 
the person upon whom the notice is served may file a reply with the DOE 
office that issued the notice of probable violation at the address 
provided in Sec. 205.12 of this chapter. The DOE may extend the 10-day 
period for good cause shown.
    (3) The reply shall be in writing and signed by the person filing 
it. The reply shall contain a full and complete statement of all 
relevant facts pertaining to the act or transaction that is the subject 
of the notice of probable violation. Such facts shall include a complete 
statement of the business or other reasons that justify the act or 
transaction, it appropriate; a detailed description of the act or 
transaction; and a full discussion of the pertinent provisions and 
relevant facts reflected in any documents submitted with the reply. 
Copies of all relevant documents shall be submitted with the reply.
    (4) The reply shall include a discussion of all relevant 
authorities, including, but not limited to, DOE rulings, regulations, 
interpretations, and decisions on appeals and exceptions relied upon to 
support the particular position taken.
    (5) The reply should indicate whether the person requests or intends 
to request a conference regarding the notice. Any request not made at 
the time of the reply shall be made as soon thereafter as possible to 
insure that the conference is held when it will be most beneficial. A 
request for a conference must conform to the requirements of subpart M 
of part 205 of this chapter.
    (6) If a person has not filed a reply with the DOE within the 10-day 
period provided, and the DOE has not extended the 10-day period, the 
person shall be deemed to have conceded the accuracy of the factual 
allegations and legal conclusions stated in the notice of probable 
violation.
    (7) If the DOE finds, after the 10-day period provided in 
Sec. 207.6(b)(2), that no violation has occurred, is continuing, or is 
about to occur, or that for any reason the issuance of a remedial order 
would not be appropriate, it shall notify, in writing, the person to 
whom a notice of probable violation has been issued that the notice is 
rescinded.
    (c) Remedial order. (1) If the DOE finds, after the 10-day period 
provided in Sec. 207.6(b)(2), that a violation has occurred, is 
continuing, or is about to occur, the DOE may issue a remedial order. 
The order shall include a written opinion setting forth the relevant 
facts and the legal basis of the remedial order.
    (2) A remedial order issued under this subpart shall be effective 
upon issuance, in accordance with its terms, until stayed, suspended, 
modified or rescinded. The DOE may stay, suspend, modify or rescind a 
remedial order on its own initiative or upon application by the person 
to whom the remedial order is issued. Such action and application shall 
be in accordance with the procedures for such proceedings provided for 
in part 205 of this chapter.
    (3) A remedial order may be referred at any time to the Department 
of Justice for appropriate action in accordance with Sec. 207.7.
    (d) Remedial order for immediate compliance. (1) Notwithstanding 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the DOE may issue a remedial 
order for immediate compliance, which shall be effective upon issuance 
and until rescinded or suspended, if it finds:
    (i) There is a strong probability that a violation has occurred, is 
continuing or is about to occur;
    (ii) Irreparable harm will occur unless the violation is remedied 
immediately; and
    (iii) The public interest requires the avoidance of such irreparable 
harm through immediate compliance and waiver of the procedures afforded 
under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (2) A remedial order for immediate compliance shall be served 
promptly upon the person against whom such order is issued by telex or 
telegram, with a copy served by registered or certified mail. The copy 
shall contain a written statement of the relevant facts and the legal 
basis for the remedial order for immediate compliance, including the 
findings required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

[[Page 51]]

    (3) The DOE may rescind or suspend a remedial order for immediate 
compliance if it appears that the criteria set forth in paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section are no longer satisfied. When appropriate, however, such 
a suspension or rescission may be accompanied by a notice of probable 
violation issued under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (4) If at any time in the course of a proceeding commenced by a 
notice of probable violation the criteria set forth in paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section are satisfied, the DOE may issue a remedial order for 
immediate compliance, even if the 10-day period for reply specified in 
Sec. 207.6(b)(2) of this part has not expired.
    (5) At any time after a remedial order for immediate compliance has 
become effective the DOE may refer such order to the Department of 
Justice for appropriate action in accordance with Sec. 207.7 of this 
part.
    (e) Remedies. A remedial order or a remedial order for immediate 
compliance may require the person to whom it is directed to take such 
action as the DOE determines is necessary to eliminate or to compensate 
for the effects of a violation.
    (f) Appeal. (1) No notice of probable violation issued pursuant to 
this subpart shall be deemed to be an action of which there may be an 
administrative appeal.
    (2) Any person to whom a remedial order or a remedial order for 
immediate compliance is issued under this subpart may file an appeal 
with the DOE Office of Exceptions and Appeals in accordance with the 
procedures for such appeal provided in subpart H of part 205 of this 
chapter. The appeal must be filed within 10 days of service of the order 
from which the appeal is taken.


<R05>
Sec. 207.7   Sanctions.

    (a) General. (1) Penalties and sanctions shall be deemed cumulative 
and not mutually exclusive.
    (2) Each day that a violation of the provisions of this subpart or 
any order issued pursuant thereto continues shall be deemed to 
constitute a separate violation within the meaning of the provisions of 
this subpart relating to criminal fines and civil penalties.
    (b) Criminal penalties. Any person who willfully violates any 
provision of this subpart or any order issued pursuant thereto shall be 
subject to a fine of not more than $5,000 for each violation. Criminal 
violations are prosecuted by the Department of Justice upon referral by 
the DOE.
    (c) Civil penalties. (1) Any person who violates any provision of 
this subpart or any order issued pursuant thereto shall be subject to a 
civil penalty of not more than $2,500 for each violation. Actions for 
civil penalties are prosecuted by the Department of Justice upon 
referral by the DOE.
    (2) When the DOE considers it to be appropriate or advisable, the 
DOE may compromise and settle, and collect civil penalties.


<R05>
Sec. 207.8   Judicial actions.

    (a) Enforcement of subpoenas; contempt. Any United States district 
court within the jurisdiction of which any inquiry is carried on may, 
upon petition by the Attorney General at the request of the 
Administrator, in the case of refusal to obey a subpoena or order of the 
Administrator issued under this subpart, issue an order requiring 
compliance. Any failure to obey such an order of the court may be 
punished by the court as contempt.
    (b) Injunctions. Whenever it appears to the Administrator that any 
person has engaged, is engaged, or is about to engage in any act or 
practice constituting a violation of any regulation or order issued 
under this subpart, the Administrator may request the Attorney General 
to bring a civil action in the appropriate district court of the United 
States to enjoin such acts or practices and, upon a proper showing, a 
temporary restraining order or preliminary or permanent injunction shall 
be granted without bond. The relief sought may include a mandatory 
injunction commanding any person to comply with any provision of such 
order or regulation, the violation of which is prohibited by section 
12(a) of ESECA, as implemented by this subpart.

recapitulate matters already contained in a full and complete record, 
the substance of such matters shall be identified, but need not be 
recorded in detail, provided that reference is made to the record and 
the portion thereof in which the substance is fully set out.

                        Subpart A--Recordkeeping


<R05>
Sec. 210.1  Records.

    (a) The recordkeeping requirements that were in effect on January 
27, 1981, in parts 210, 211, and 212 will remain in effect for (1) all 
transactions prior to February 1, 1981; and (2) all allowed expenses 
incurred and paid prior to April 1, 1981 under Sec. 212.78 of part 212. 
These requirements include, but are not limited to, the requirements 
that were in effect on January 27, 1981, in Sec. 210.92 of this part; in 
Secs. 211.67(a)(5)(ii); 211.89; 211.109, 211.127; and 211.223 of part 
211; and in Secs. 212.78(h)(5)(ii); 212.78(h)(6); 
212.83(c)(2)(iii)(E)(I); 212.83(c)(2)(iii)(E)(II); 212.83(c)(2)(iii); 
``F<INF>i</INF><SUP>t</SUP>''; 212.83(i); 212.93(a); 
212.93(b)(4)(iii)(B)(I); 212.93(i)(4); 212.94(b)(2)(iii); 212.128; 
212.132; 212.172; and Sec. 212.187 of part 212.
    (b) Effective February 5, 1985, paragraph (a) of this section shall 
apply, to the extent indicated, only to firms in the following 
categories. A firm may be included in more than one category, and a firm 
may move from one category to another. The fact that a firm becomes no 
longer subject to the recordkeeping requirements of one category shall 
not relieve that firm of compliance with the recordkeeping requirements 
of any other category in which the firm is still included.
    (1) Those firms which are or become parties in litigation with DOE, 
as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Any such firm shall 
remain subject to paragraph (a) of this section. DOE shall notify the 
firm in writing of the final resolution of the litigation and whether or 
not any of its records must be maintained for a further period. DOE 
shall notify a firm which must maintain any records for a further period 
when such records are no longer needed.
    (2)(i) Those firms which as of November 30 1984, have completed 
making all restitutionary payments required by an administrative or 
judicial order, consent order, or other settlement or order but which 
payments are on February 5, 1985, still subject to distribution by DOE. 
This requirement is applicable to only those firms listed in appendix B. 
Any such firm shall maintain all records for the time period covered by 
the administrative or judicial order, consent order, or other settlement 
or order requiring the payments, evidencing sales volume data for each 
product subject to controls and customers' names and addresses, until 
one of the following: June 30, 1985, unless this period is extended on a 
firm-by-firm basis; the end of the individual firm's extension; or the 
firm is notified in writing that its records are no longer needed.
    (ii) Those firms which as of November 30, 1984, are required to make 
restitutionary or other payments pursuant to an administrative or 
judicial order, consent order, or other settlement or order. Any such 
firm shall remain subject to paragraph (a) of this

[[Page 58]]

section until the firm completes all restitutionary payments required by 
the administrative or judicial order, consent order, or other settlement 
or order. However, after completing all such payments, a firm shall 
maintain all records described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section 
until one of the following: Six months after the firm completes all such 
payments, unless this period is extended on a firm-by-firm basis; the 
end of the individual firm's extension; or the firm is notified in 
writing that its records are no longer needed.
    (3)(i) Those firms with completed audits in which DOE has not yet 
made a determination to initiate a formal enforcement action and firms 
under audit which do not have outstanding subpoenas. Any such firm shall 
maintain all records for the period covered by the audit including all 
records necessary to establish historical prices or volumes which serve 
as the basis for determining the lawful prices or volumes for any 
subsequent regulated transaction which is subject to audit, until one of 
the following: June 30, 1985, unless this period is extended on a firm-
by-firm basis; the end of the individual firm's extension; or the firm 
is notified in writing by DOE that its records are no longer needed. 
However, if a firm in this group shall become a party in litigation, the 
firm shall then be subject to the recordkeeping requirements for firms 
in litigation set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Those firms under audit which have outstanding subpoenas on 
February 5, 1985, or which receive subpoenas at any time thereafter or 
which have supplied records for an audit as the result of a subpoena 
enforced after November 1, 1983. Any such firm shall remain subject to 
paragraph (a) of this section until two years after ERA has notified the 
firm in writing that is in full compliance with the subpoena or until 
ERA has received from the firm a sworn certification of compliance with 
the subpoena as required by 10 CFR 205.8. However, if a firm in this 
group shall become a party in litigation, the firm shall then be subject 
to the recordkeeping requirements for firms in litigation set forth in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (4) Those firms which are subject to requests for data necessary to 
verify that crude oil qualifies as ``newly discovered'' crude oil under 
10 CFR 212.79. Any such firm shall maintain the records evidencing such 
data until one of the following: June 30, 1985, unless this period is 
extended on a firm-by-firm basis; the end of an individual firm's 
extension; or the firm is notified in writing by DOE that its records 
are no longer needed. However, if a firm in this group shall become a 
party in litigation, the firm shall then be subject to the recordkeeping 
requirements for firms in litigation set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section.
    (5) Those firms whose records are determined by DOE as necessary to 
complete the enforcement activity relating to another firm which is also 
subject to paragraph (a) of this section unless such firms required to 
keep records have received certified notice letters specifically 
describing the records determined as necessary. At that time, the 
specific notice will control the recordkeeping requirements. These firms 
have been identified in appendix A. Any such firm shall maintain these 
records until one of the following: June 30, 1985, unless this period is 
extended on a firm-by-firm basis; the end of the individual firm's 
extension; or the firm is notified in writing by DOE that its records 
are no longer needed.
    (6) Those firms which participated in the Entitlements program. Any 
such firm shall maintain its Entitlements-related records until six 
months after the final judicial resolution (including any and all 
appeals) of Texaco v. DOE, Nos. 84-391, 84-410, and 84-456 (D. Del.), or 
the firm is notified by DOE that its records are no longer needed, 
whichever occurs first.
    (c) For purposes of this section:
    (1) A firm is ``a party in litigation'' if:
    (i)(A) The firm has received a Notice of Probable Violation, a 
Notice of Probable Disallowance, a Proposed Remedial Order, or a 
Proposed Order of Disallowance; or
    (B) The firm and DOE are parties in a lawsuit arising under the 
Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, as amended (15 U.S.C. 751 et 
seq.) or 10 CFR parts 205, 210, 211, or 212; and

[[Page 59]]

    (ii)(A) There has been no final (that is, non-appealable) 
administrative or judicial resolution, or
    (B) DOE has not informed the firm in writing that the Department has 
completed its review of the matter.
    (2) A firm means any association, company, corporation, estate, 
individual, joint-venture, partnership, or sole proprietorship, or any 
other entity, however organized, including charitable, educational, or 
other eleemosynary institutions, and state and local governments. A firm 
includes a parent and the consolidated and unconsolidated entities (if 
any) which it directly or indirectly controls.

    Annual prepaid expenses report. By January 31 of each year after 
1980, the project operator with respect to any enhanced oil recovery 
project for which a report had been filed previously with DOE pursuant 
to paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section as that paragraph was in effect 
on January 27, 1981, shall file with DOE a report in which the operator 
shall certify to DOE (a) which of the expenses that had been reported 
previously to DOE pursuant to paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section as 
that paragraph was in effect on January 27, 1981, were prepaid expenses; 
(b) the goods or services for which such expenses had been incurred and 
paid; (c) the dates on which such goods or services are intended to be 
used; (d) the dates on which such goods or services actually are used; 
(e) the identity of each qualified producer to which such prepaid 
expenses had been attributed; and (f) the percentage of such prepaid 
expenses attributed to each such qualified producer. An operator shall 
file an annual prepaid expenses report each year until it has reported 
the actual use of all the goods and services for which a prepaid expense 
had been incurred and paid. For purposes of this paragraph, a prepaid 
expense is an expense for any injectant or fuel used after September 30,

<R05>
Sec. 216.1  Introduction.

    (a) This part describes and establishes the procedures to be used by 
the Department of Energy (``DOE'') in considering and making certain 
findings required by section 101(c)(3) of the Defense Production Act of 
1950, as amended, 50 U.S.C. App. 2071(c)(3) (``DPA''). Section 101(c) 
authorizes the allocation of, or priority performance under contracts or 
orders (other than contracts of employment) relating to, supplies of 
materials and equipment in order to maximize domestic energy supplies if 
the findings described in section 101(c)(3) are made. Among these 
findings are that such supplies of materials and equipment are critical 
and essential to maintain or further exploration, production, refining, 
transportation or the conservation of energy supplies or for the 
construction and maintenance of energy facilities. The function of 
finding if such supplies are critical and essential was delegated to the 
Administrator of the Department of Energy (``DOE'') pursuant to 
Executive Order

[[Page 67]]

11912 of April 13, 1976, Defense Mobilization Order (``DMO'') No. 13 
dated September 22, 1976, 41 FR 43720, and Department of Commerce, 
Bureau of Domestic Commerce, Delegation No. 4, effective date December 
1, 1976, 41 FR 52331. Delegation No. 4 was superseded by Defense 
Priorities and Allocations System Delegation No. 2, effective date 
August 29, 1984, 49 FR 30430. On October 1, 1977, pursuant to section 
301(a) of the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. 95-91), all 
of the functions of DOE and all of the functions of the DOE 
Administrator were transferred to the Secretary of Energy.
    (b) The purpose of these regulations is to establish the procedures 
and the criteria to be used by DOE in determining whether programs or 
projects maximize domestic energy supplies and finding whether or not 
supplies of material and equipment are critical and essential, as 
required by DPA section 101(c)(3). The critical and essential finding 
will be made only for supplies of materials and equipment related to 
those programs or projects determined by DOE to maximize domestic energy 
supplies. These regulations do not require or imply that the findings, 
on which the exercise of such authority is conditioned, will be made in 
any particular case.
    (c) If DOE determines that a program or project maximizes domestic 
energy supplies and finds that supplies of materials and equipment are 
critical and essential to maintain or further the exploration, 
production, refining, transportation or conservation of energy supplies 
or for the construction and maintenance of energy facilities, such 
determination and finding will be communicated to the Department of 
Commerce. If not, the applicant will be so informed. If the 
determination and finding described above are made, the Department of 
Commerce, pursuant to DPA section 101(c), Executive Order 11912 and DMO 
No. 13, will find whether or not (1) the supplies of materials and 
equipment in question are scarce and (2) maintenance or furtherance of 
exploration, production, refining, transportation, or conservation of 
energy supplies or the construction and maintenance of energy facilities 
cannot be reasonably accomplished without exercising the authority 
specified in section 101(c). If these additional two findings are made, 
the Department of Commerce will notify DOE, and DOE will inform the 
applicant that it has been granted the right to use priority ratings 
under the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (``DPAS'') 
regulation established by the Department of Commerce, 15 CFR 350.

equipment are allegedly required; and
    (5) Established national energy policies.
    (c) In findings whether the supplies of materials or equipment 
described in the application are critical and essential to an eligible 
energy program or project, DOE will consider all factors which it 
considers relevant including, but not limited to, the following:
    (1) Availability and utility of substitute materials or equipment; 
and
    (2) Impact of the nonavailability of the specific supplies of 
materials and equipment on the furtherance or timely completion of the 
approved energy program or project.
    (d) Increased costs which may be associated with obtaining materials 
or equipment without assistance shall not be considered a valid reason 
for finding the materials and equipment to be critical and essential.
    (e) After DOE has determined a program or project to be an eligible 
energy program or project, this determination shall be deemed made with 
regard to subsequent applications involving the same program or project 
unless and until DOE announces otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 216.5  Notification of findings.

    (a) DOE will notify the DOC if it finds that supplies of materials 
and equipment, for which an applicant requested assistance, are critical 
and essential to an eligible energy program or project, and in such 
cases will forward to the DOC the application and whatever information 
or comments DOE believes appropriate. If DOE believes at any time that 
findings previously made may no longer be valid, it will immediately 
notify the DOC and the affected applicant(s) and afford such 
applicant(s) an opportunity to show cause why such findings should not 
be withdrawn.
    (b) If DOC notifies DOE that DOC has found that supplies of 
materials and equipment, for which the applicant requested assistance, 
are scarce and that the related eligible energy program or project 
cannot reasonably be accomplished without exercising the authority 
specified in DPA section 101(c)(1), DOE will notify the applicant that 
the applicant is authorized to place rated orders and/or authorized 
controlled material orders for specific supplies of materials and 
equipment pursuant to the provisions of the DPAS Regulation, as 
promulgated by the Department of Commerce.

Sec. 216.6  Petition for reconsideration.

    If DOE, after evaluating an application in accordance with 
Sec. 216.4, does not determine that the energy program or project 
maximizes domestic energy supplies or does not find that the supplies of 
materials and equipment described in the application are critical and 
essential to an eligible energy program or project, it will so notify 
the applicant and the applicant may petition DOE for reconsideration. If 
DOE concludes at any time that findings previously made are no longer 
valid and should be withdrawn, DOE will so notify the affected 
applicant(s), and such applicant(s) may petition DOE for reconsideration 
of the withdrawal decision. Such a petition is deemed accepted when 
received by DOE at the address stated in Sec. 216.8. DOE will consider 
the petition for reconsideration and either grant or deny the relief 
requested. Written notice of the decision and of the reasons for the 
decision will be provided to the applicant. There has not been an 
exhaustion of administrative remedies until a petition for 
reconsideration has been submitted and the review procedure completed by 
grant or denial of the relief requested.

[[Page 70]]

The denial of relief requested in a petition for reconsideration is a 
final administrative decision.

<R05>
Sec. 216.7  Conflict in priority orders.

    If it appears that the use of assistance pursuant to DPA section 
101(c) creates or threatens to create a conflict with priorities and 
allocation support provided in connection with the national defense 
pursuant to DPA section 101(a), DOE will work with the DOC and other 
claimant agencies affected by such conflict in an attempt to reschedule 
deliveries or otherwise accommodate such competing demands. If 
acceptable solutions cannot be agreed upon by the claimant agencies the 
FEMA will resolve such conflicts.

Sec. 218.32  Review.

    (a) Purpose and scope. This subpart establishes the procedures for 
the filing of an application for review of a supply order. An 
application for review is a summary proceeding which will be initiated 
only if the critieria described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section are 
satisfied.
    (b) What to file. (1) A firm filing under this subpart shall file an 
``Application for Review'' which should be clearly labeled as such both 
on the application and on the outside of the envelope in which the 
application is transmitted,

[[Page 73]]

and shall be in writing and signed by the firm filing the application. 
The applicant shall comply with the general filing requirements stated 
in 10 CFR 205.9 in addition to the requirements stated in this section.
    (2) If the applicant wishes to claim confidential treatment for any 
information contained in the application or other documents submitted 
under this subpart, the procedures set out in 10 CFR 205.9(f) shall 
apply.
    (c) When to file. An application for review should be filed no later 
than 5 days after the receipt by the applicant of the supply order that 
is the subject of the application, or no later than 2 days after the 
occurrence of an event that results in a substantial change in the facts 
or circumstances affecting the applicant.
    (d) Where to file. The application for review shall be filed with 
DOE Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), 2000 M Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20461.
    (e) Notice. The applicant shall send by United States mail or 
deliver by hand a copy of the application and any subsequent amendments 
or other documents relating to the application to the Administrator of 
the Economic Regulatory Administration of DOE, 2000 M Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20461. Service shall be made on the ERA at same time the 
document is filed with OHA and each document filed with the OHA shall 
include certification that the applicant has complied with the 
requirements of this paragraph.
    (f) Contents. (1) The application shall contain a full and complete 
statement of all relevant facts pertaining to the application and to the 
DOE action sought. Such facts shall include a complete statement of the 
business or other reasons that justify review of the supply order and a 
full description of the pertinent provisions and relevant facts 
contained in any relevant documents. Copies of all contracts, 
agreements, leases, instruments, and other documents relevant to the 
application shall be submitted with the application. A copy of the order 
of which review is sought shall be included with the application. When 
the application pertains to only one step of a larger integrated 
transaction, the facts, circumstances, and other relevant information 
pertaining to the entire transaction shall be submitted.
    (2) The application shall include a discussion of all relevant 
authorities, including, but not limited to, DOE and DOE rulings, 
regulations, interpretations and decisions on appeal and exception 
relied upon to support the action sought therein.
    (g) DOE evaluation--(1) Processing. (i) The DOE may initiate an 
investigation of any statement in an application and utilize in its 
evaluation any relevant facts obtained by such investigation. The DOE 
may solicit and accept submissions from third parties relevant to any 
application for review provided that the applicant is afforded an 
opportunity to respond to all third party submissions. In evaluating an 
application for review, the DOE may convene a conference, on its own 
initiative, if, in its discretion, it considers that a conference will 
advance its evaluation of the application.
    (ii) If the DOE determines that there is insufficient information 
upon which to base a decision and if upon request the necessary 
additional information is not submitted, the DOE may dismiss the 
application without prejudice. If the failure to supply additional 
information is repeated or willful, the DOE may dismiss the application 
with prejudice. If the applicant fails to provide the notice required by 
paragraph (e) of this section, the DOE may dismiss the application 
without prejudice.
    (iii) An order dismissing an application for any of the reasons 
specified in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section shall contain a 
statement of the grounds for the dismissal. The order shall become final 
within 5 days of its service upon the applicant, unless within such 5-
day period the applicant files an amendment correcting the deficiencies 
identified in the order. Within 5 days of the filing of such amendment, 
the DOE shall notify the applicant whether the amendment corrects the 
specified deficiencies. If the amendment does not correct the 
deficiencies specified in the order, the order shall become a final 
order of the DOE of which the applicant may seek judicial review.
    (2) An application for review of an order shall be processed only if 
the applicant demonstrates that--

[[Page 74]]

    (i) There is probable cause to believe that the supply order is 
erroneous, inequitable, or unduly burdensome; or
    (ii) There has been discovered a law, regulation, interpretation, 
ruling, order or decision that was in effect at the time of the 
application which, if it had been made known to the DOE, would have been 
relevant to the supply order and would have substantially altered the 
supply order; or
    (iii) There has been a substantial change in the facts or 
circumstances affecting the applicant, which change has occurred during 
the interval between issuance of the supply order and the date of the 
application and was caused by forces or circumstances beyond the control 
of the applicant.
    (h) Decision. (1) Upon consideration of the application and other 
relevant information received or obtained during the proceeding, the DOE 
shall issue an order granting or denying the modification or rescission 
of the supply order requested in the application for review.
    (2) The DOE shall process applications for review as expeditiously 
as possible. When administratively feasible, the DOE shall issue an 
order granting or denying the application within 20 business days after 
receipt of the application.
    (3) The order shall include a written statement setting forth the 
relevant facts and the legal basis of the order. The order shall state 
that it is a final order of which the applicant may seek judicial 
review.
    (4) The DOE shall serve a copy of the order upon the applicant and 
any other party who participated in the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 218.33  Stay.

    (a) The DOE may issue an order granting a stay if the DOE determines 
that an applicant has made a compelling showing that it would incur 
serious and irreparable injury unless immediate stay relief is granted 
pending determination of an application for review pursuant to this 
subpart. An application for a stay shall be labeled as such on the 
application and on the outside of the envelope in which the application 
is transmitted, and shall be in writing and signed by the firm filing 
the application. It shall include a description of the proceeding 
incident to which the stay is being sought and of the facts and 
circumstances which support the applicant's claim that it will incur 
irreparable injury unless immediate stay relief is granted. The 
applicant shall comply with the general filing requirements stated in 10 
CFR 205.9 in addition to the requirements stated in this section. The 
DOE on its own initiative may also issue an order granting a stay upon a 
finding that a firm will incur irreparable injury if such an order is 
not granted.
    (b) An order granting a stay shall expire by its terms within such 
time after issuance, not to exceed 30 days as the DOE specifies in the 
order, except that it shall expire automatically 5 days following its 
issuance if the applicant fails within that period to file an 
application for review unless within that period the DOE for good cause 
shown, extends the time during which the applicant may file an 
application for review.
    (c) The order granting or denying a stay is not an order of the DOE 
subject to administrative review.


<R05>
Sec. 218.34  Addresses.

    All correspondence, petitions, and any information required by this 
part shall be submitted to: Administrator, Economic Regulatory 
Administration, Department of Energy, 2000 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 
20461, and to the Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department 
of Energy, 2000 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20461.

<R04>
           Subpart D--Administrative Procedures and Sanctions


<R05>
Sec. 221.31  Requests by DOD.

    (a) When DOD finds that (1) a fuel supply shortage for DOD exists or 
is anticipated which would have a substantial negative impact on the 
national defense, and (2) the defense activity for which fuel is 
required cannot be postponed until after the fuel supply shortage is 
likely to terminate, DOD may submit a written request to ERA for the 
issuance to it of a priority rating for the supply of crude oil and 
petroleum products.
    (b) Not later than the transmittal date of its request to ERA, DOD 
shall notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency that it has 
requested a priority rating from ERA.
    (c) Requests from DOD shall set forth the following:
    (1) The quantity and quality of crude oil or petroleum products 
determined by DOD to be required to meet national defense requirements;
    (2) The required delivery dates;
    (3) The defense-related activity and the supply location for which 
the crude oil or petroleum product is to be delivered;
    (4) The current or most recent suppliers of the crude oil or 
petroleum product and the reasons, if known, why the suppliers will not 
supply the requested crude oil or petroleum product;
    (5) The degree to which it is feasible for DOD to use an alternate 
product in lieu of that requested and, if such an alternative product 
can be used, the efforts which have been made to obtain the alternate 
product;
    (6) The period during which the shortage of crude oil or petroleum 
products is expected to exist;
    (7) The proposed supply source for the additional crude oil or 
petroleum products required, which shall, if practicable, be the 
historical supplier of such crude oil or product to DOD; and
    (8) Certification that DOD has made each of the findings required by 
paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 221.32  Evaluation of DOD request.

    (a) Upon receipt of a request from DOD for a priority rating as 
provided in Sec. 221.31, it shall be reviewed promptly by ERA. The ERA 
will assess the request in terms of:
    (1) The information provided under Sec. 221.31;
    (2) Whether DOD's national defense needs for crude oil or petroleum 
products can reasonably be satisfied without exercising the authority 
specified in this part;
    (3) The capability of the proposed supplier to supply the crude oil 
or petroleum product in the amounts required;
    (4) The known capabilities of alternative suppliers;
    (5) The feasibility to DOD of converting to and using a product 
other than that requested; and
    (6) Any other relevant information.
    (b) The ERA promptly shall notify the proposed supplier of DOD's 
request for a priority rating specified under this part. The proposed 
supplier shall have a period specified in the notice, not to exceed 
fifteen (15) days from the date it is notified of DOD's request, to show 
cause in writing why it cannot supply the requested quantity and quality 
of crude oil or petroleum products. ERA shall consider this information 
in determining whether to issue the priority rating.
    (c) If acceptance by a supplier of a rated order would create a 
conflict with another rated order of the supplier, it shall include all 
pertinent information regarding such conflict in its response to the 
show cause order provided for in subsection (b), and ERA, in 
consultation with DOD and the Federal Emergency Management Agency shall

[[Page 78]]

determine the priorities for meeting all such requirements.
    (d) ERA may waive some or all of the requirements of Sec. 221.31 or 
this section where the Secretary of Defense or his designee certifies, 
and has so notified the Federal Emergency Management Agency, that a fuel 
shortage for DOD exists or is imminent and that compliance with such 
requirements would have a substantial negative impact on the national 
defense.


<R05>
Sec. 221.33  Order.

    (a) Issuance. If ERA determines that issuance of a priority rating 
for a crude oil or refined petroleum product is necessary to provide the 
crude oil or petroleum products needed to meet the national defense 
requirement established by DOD, it shall issue such a rating to DOD for 
delivery of specified qualities and quantities of the crude oil or 
refined petroleum products on or during specified delivery dates or 
periods. In accordance with the terms of the order, DOD may then place 
such priority rating on a supply order.
    (b) Compliance. Each person who receives a priority-rated supply 
order pursuant to this part shall supply the specified crude oil or 
petroleum products to DOD in accordance with the terms of that order.
    (c) ERA directives. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this 
part, where necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense ERA 
is authorized to issue a directive to a supplier of crude oil or 
petroleum product requiring delivery of specified qualities and 
quantities of such crude oil or petroleum products to DOD at or during 
specified delivery dates or periods.
    (d) Use of ratings by suppliers. No supplier who receives a 
priority-rated supply order or directive issued under the authority of 
this section may use such priority order or directive in order to obtain 
materials necessary to meet its supply obligations thereunder.


<R05>
Sec. 221.34  Effect of order.

    Defense against claims for damages. No person shall be liable for 
damages or penalties for any act or failure to act resulting directly or 
indirectly from compliance with any ERA authorized priority-rated supply 
order or ERA directive issued pursuant to this part, notwithstanding 
that such priority-rated supply order or directive thereafter be 
declared by judicial or other competent authority to be invalid.


<R05>
Sec. 221.35  Contractual requirements.

    (a) No supplier may discriminate against an order or contract on 
which a priority rating has been placed under this part by charging 
higher prices, by imposing terms and conditions for such orders or 
contracts different from other generally comparable orders or contracts, 
or by any other means.
    (b) Contracts with priority ratings shall be subject to all 
applicable laws and regulations which govern the making of such 
contracts, including those specified in 10 CFR 211.26(e).


<R05>
Sec. 221.36  Records and reports.

    (a) Each person receiving an order or directive under this part 
shall keep for at least two years from the date of full compliance with 
such order or directive accurate and complete records of crude oil and 
petroleum product deliveries made in accordance with such order or 
directive.
    (b) All records required to be maintained shall be made available 
upon request for inspection and audit by duly authorized representatives

section. For every other condenser-evaporator coil combination 
manufactured by the same manufacturer or in part by a component 
manufacturer using that same condensing unit, either--
    (i) A sample of sufficient size, comprised of production units or 
representing production units, shall be tested to ensure that the 
requirements of paragraphs (m)(1)(i) and (m)(1)(ii) of this section are 
met for such other condenser-evaporator coil combinations; or
    (ii) The representative values of the measures of energy consumption

this section.
    (3) Whenever the representative values of the measures of energy 
consumption, as determined by the provisions of paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of 
this section, do not agree within five percent of the representative 
values of the measures of energy consumption as determined by actual 
testing, the representative values determined by actual testing shall be 
used to comply with section 323(c) of the Act, or to comply with rules 
prescribed under section 324 of the Act.
    (4) The basis of the alternative rating method referred to in 
paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of this section shall be a representation of the 
test data and calculations of a mechanical vapor compression 
refrigeration cycle. The major components in the refrigeration cycle

and (m)(4) of this section must submit a request to DOE for reviewing 
the alternative rating method to the Assistant Secretary of Conservation 
and Renewable Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 
20585, and receive approval to use the alternative method by the 
Assistant Secretary before the alternative method may be used for rating 
central air conditioners.

of two. Rating information for the mixed systems shall include the

[[Page 118]]

ratings from testing, and from the alternative rating method.
    (iv) Complete test data, product information, and related

the manufacturer.
    (7) Manufacturers that elect to use an alternative rating method for 
determining measures of energy consumption under paragraphs (m)(2)(ii) 
and (m)(4) of this section must either subject a sample of their units 
to independent testing on a regular basis, e.g., voluntary certification 
program, or have the representations reviewed and certified by an 
independent state-registered professional engineer who is not an 
employee of the manufacturer. The registered professional engineer is to 
certify that the results of the alternative rating procedure accurately 
represent the energy consumption of the unit(s). The manufacturer is to 
keep the registered professional engineer's certifications on file for 
review by DOE for as long as said combination is made available for sale 
by the manufacturer. Any change to be made to the alternative rating 
method, must be approved by DOE prior to its use for rating.
    (8) Manufacturers who choose to use computer simulation or 
engineering analysis for determining measures of energy consumption 
under paragraphs (m)(2)(ii) and (m)(5) of this section shall permit 
representatives of the Department of Energy to inspect for verification 
purposes the simulation method or methods used. This inspection may 
include conducting simulations to predict the performance of particular 
condenser-evaporator coil combinations specified by DOE, analysis of 
previous simulations conducted by a manufacturer, or both.

shall be averaged to insure that any represented value of CRI of a basic 
model for which consumers would favor a higher value shall be no greater 
than the lower of (i) The mean of the sample or (ii) The lower 99 
percent confidence limit of the true mean divided by 0.99.

Sec. 430.27  Petitions for waiver and applications for interim waiver.

    (a)(1) Any interested person may submit a petition to waive for a 
particular basic model any requirements of Sec. 430.22, or of any 
appendix to this subpart, upon the grounds that the basic model contains 
one or more design characteristics which either prevent testing of the 
basic model according to the prescribed test procedures, or the 
prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner so 
unrepresentative of its true energy consumption characteristics as to 
provide materially inaccurate comparative data.
    (2) Any interested person who has submitted a Petition for Waiver as 
provided in this subpart may also file an Application for Interim Waiver 
of the applicable test procedure requirements.
    (b)(1) A Petition for Waiver shall be submitted, in triplicate, to 
the Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energy, United 
States Department of Energy. Each Petition for Waiver shall:
    (i) Identify the particular basic model(s) for which a waiver is 
requested, the design characteristic(s) constituting the grounds for the 
petition, and the specific requirements sought to be waived and shall 
discuss in detail the need for the requested waiver;
    (ii) Identify manufacturers of all other basic models marketed in 
the United States and known to the petitioner to incorporate similar 
design characteristic(s);
    (iii) Include any alternate test procedures known to the petitioner 
to evaluate in a manner representative of the energy consumption 
characteristics of the basic model; and
    (iv) Be signed by the petitioner or by an authorized representative. 
In accordance with the provisions set forth in 10 CFR 1004.11, any 
request for confidential treatment of any information contained in a 
Petition for Waiver or in supporting documentation must be accompanied 
by a copy of the petition, application or supporting documentation from 
which the information claimed to be confidential has been deleted. DOE 
shall publish in the Federal Register the petition and supporting 
documents from which confidential information, as determined by DOE, has 
been deleted in accordance with 10 CFR 1004.11 and shall solicit 
comments, data and information with respect to the determination of the 
petition. Any person submitting written comments to DOE with the respect 
to a Petition for Waiver shall also send a copy of such comments to the 
petitioner. In accordance with paragraph (i) of this section, a 
petitioner may submit a rebuttal statement to the Assistant Secretary 
for Conservation and Renewable Energy.
    (2) An Application for Interim Waiver shall be submitted in 
triplicate, with the required three copies of the Petition for Waiver, 
to the Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energy, U.S. 
Department of Energy. Each Application for Interim Waiver shall 
reference the Petition for Waiver by identifying the particular basic 
model(s) for which a waiver and temporary exception are being sought. 
Each Application for Interim Waiver shall demonstrate likely success of 
the Petition for Waiver and shall address what economic hardship and/or 
competitive disadvantage is likely to result absent a favorable 
determination on the Application for Interim Waiver. Each Application 
for Interim Waiver shall be signed by the applicant or by an authorized 
representative.
    (c)(1) Each petitioner, after filing a Petition for Waiver with DOE, 
and after the Petition for Waiver has been published in the Federal 
Register, shall, within five working days of such publication, notify in 
writing all known manufacturers of domestically marketed units of the 
same product type (as listed in section 322(a) of the Act) and shall 
include in the notice a statement that DOE has published in the Federal 
Register  on a certain date the Petition for Waiver and supporting 
documents from which confidential information, if any, as determined by 
DOE, has been deleted in accordance with 10 CFR 1004.11. Each 
petitioner, in complying with the requirements of this paragraph, shall 
file with DOE a statement certifying the names and addresses of each

whom a notice of the Petition for Waiver has been sent.
    (2) Each applicant for Interim Waiver, whether filing jointly with, 
or subsequent to, a Petition for Waiver with DOE, shall concurrently 
notify in writing all known manufacturers of domestically marketed units 
of the same product type (as listed in Section 322(a) of the Act) and 
shall include in the notice a copy of the Petition for Waiver and a copy 
of the Application for Interim Waiver. In complying with this section, 
each applicant shall in the written notification include a statement 
that the Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energy will 
receive and consider timely written comments on the Application for 
Interim Waiver. Each applicant, upon filing an Application for Interim 
Waiver, shall in complying with the requirements of this paragraph 
certify to DOE that a copy of these documents have been sent to all 
known manufacturers of domestically marked units of the same product 
type (as listed in section 322(a) of the Act). Such certification shall 
include the names and addresses of such persons. Each applicant also 
shall comply with the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
with respect to the petition for waiver.
    (d) Any person submitting written comments to DOE with respect to an 
Application for Interim Waiver shall also send a copy of the comments to 
the applicant.
    (e) If administratively feasible, applicant shall be notified in 
writing of the disposition of the Application for Interim Waiver within 
15 business days of receipt of the application. Notice of DOE's 
determination on the Application for Interim Waiver shall be published 
in the Federal Register.
    (f) The filing of an Application for Interim Waiver shall not 
constitute grounds for noncompliance with any requirements of this 
subpart, until an Interim Waiver has been granted.
    (g) An Interim Waiver from test procedure requirements will be 
granted by the Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energy 
if it is determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship 
if the Application for Interim Waiver is denied, if it appears likely 
that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant 
Secretary determines that it would be desirable for public policy 
reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the 
Petition for Waiver.
    (h) An interim waiver will terminate 180 days after issuance or upon 
the determination on the Petition for Waiver, whichever occurs first. An 
interim waiver may be extended by DOE for 180 days. Notice of such 
extension and/or any modification of the terms or duration of the 
interim waiver shall be published in the Federal Register, and shall be 
based on relevant information contained in the record and any comments 
received subsequent to issuance of the interim waiver.
    (i) Following publication of the Petition for Waiver in the Federal 
Register, a petitioner may, within 10 working days of receipt of a copy 
of any comments submitted in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, submit a rebuttal statement to the Assistant Secretary for 
Conservation and Renewable Energy. A petitioner may rebut more than one 
response in a single rebuttal statement.
    (j) The petitioner shall be notified in writing as soon as 
practicable of the disposition of each Petition for Waiver. The 
Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energy shall issue a 
decision on the petition as soon as is practicable following receipt and 
review of the Petition for Waiver and other applicable documents, 
including, but not limited to, comments and rebuttal statements.
    (k) The filing of a Petition for Waiver shall not constitute grounds 
for noncompliance with any requirements of this subpart, until a waiver 
or interim waiver has been granted.
    (l) Waivers will be granted by the Assistant Secretary for 
Conservation and Renewable Energy, if it is determined that the basic 
model for which the waiver was requested contains a design 
characteristic which either prevents testing of the basic model 
according to the prescribed test procedures, or the prescribed test 
procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner so unrepresentative 
of its true energy consumption characteristics as to provide materially 
inaccurate comparative

[[Page 123]]

data. Waivers may be granted subject to conditions, which may include 
adherence to alternate test procedures specified by the Assistant 
Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energy. The Assistant Secretary 
shall consult with the Federal Trade Commission prior to granting any 
waiver, and shall promptly publish in the Federal Register  notice of 
each waiver granted or denied, and any limiting conditions of each 
waiver granted.
    (m) Within one year of the granting of any waiver, the Department of 
Energy will publish in the Federal Register a notice of proposed 
rulemaking to amend its regulations so as to eliminate any need for the 
continuation of such waiver. As soon thereafter as practicable, the 
Department of Energy will publish in the Federal Register  a final rule. 
Such waiver will terminate on the effective date of such final rule.
    (n) In order to exhaust administrative remedies, any person 
aggrieved by an action under this section must file an appeal with the 
DOE's Office of Hearings and Appeals as provided in 10 CFR part 1003, 
subpart C.

Appendix A1 To Subpart B of Part 430--Uniform Test Method for Measuring 
     the Energy Consumption of Electric Refrigerators and Electric 
                          Refrigerator-Freezers

                             1. Definitions

    1.1  ``HRF-1-1979'' means the Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers standard for household refrigerators, combination 
refrigerator-freezers, and household freezers, also approved as an 
American National Standard as a revision of ANSI B 38.1-1970.
    1.2  ``Adjusted total volume'' means the sum of (i) the fresh food 
compartment volume as defined in HRF-1-1979 in cubic feet, and (ii) the 
product of an adjustment factor and the net freezer compartment volume 
as defined in HRF-1-1979, in cubic feet.
    1.3  ``Anti-sweat heater'' means a device incorporated into the 
design of a refrigerator or refrigerator-freezer to prevent the 
accumulation of moisture on exterior surfaces of the cabinet under 
conditions of high ambient humidity.
    1.4  ``All-refrigerator'' means an electric refrigerator which does 
not include a compartment for the freezing and long time storage of food 
at temperatures below 32 deg. F. (0.0 deg. C.). It may include a 
compartment of 0.50 cubic feet capacity (14.2 liters) or less for the 
freezing and storage of ice.
    1.5  ``Cycle'' means the period of 24 hours for which the energy use 
of an electric refrigerator or electric refrigerator-freezer is 
calculated as though the consumer activated compartment temperature 
controls were set so that the desired compartment temperatures were 
maintained.
    1.6  ``Cycle type'' means the set of test conditions having the 
calculated effect of operating an electric refrigerator or electric 
refrigerator-freezer for a period of 24 hours, with the consumer 
activated controls other than those that control compartment 
temperatures set to establish various operating characteristics.
    1.7  ``Standard cycle'' means the cycle type in which the anti-sweat 
heater control, when provided, is set in the highest energy consuming 
position.
    1.8  ``Automatic defrost'' means a system in which the defrost cycle 
is automatically initiated and terminated, with resumption of normal 
refrigeration at the conclusion of the defrost operation. The system 
automatically prevents the permanent formation of frost on all 
refrigerated surfaces. Nominal refrigerated food temperatures are 
maintained during the operation of the automatic defrost system.
    1.9  ``Long-time Automatic Defrost'' means an automatic defrost 
system where successive defrost cycles are separated by 14 hours or more 
of compressor-operating time.
    1.10  ``Stabilization Period'' means the total period of time during 
which steady-state conditions are being attained or evaluated.
    1.11  ``Variable defrost control'' means a long-time automatic 
defrost system (except the 14-hour defrost qualification does not apply) 
where successive defrost cycles are determined by an operating condition 
variable or variables other than solely compressor operating time. This 
includes any electrical or mechanical device. Demand defrost is a type 
of variable defrost control.

                           2. Test Conditions

    2.1  Ambient temperature. The ambient temperature shall be 90.0 
<plus-minus> 1 deg. F. (32.3<plus-minus>0.6 deg. C.) during the 
stabilization period and during the test period. The ambient temperature 
shall be 80<plus-minus>2 deg.F dry bulb and 67 deg.F wet bulb during the 
stabilization period and during the test period when the unit is tested 
in accordance with section 3.3.
    2.2  Operational conditions. The electric refrigerator or electric 
refrigerator-freezer shall be installed and its operating conditions 
maintained in accordance with HRF-1-1979, section 7.2 through section 
7.4.3.3, except that the vertical ambient temperature gradient at 
locations 10 inches (25.4 cm) out from the centers of the two sides of 
the unit

[[Page 124]]

being tested is to be maintained during the test. Unless the area is 
obstructed by shields or baffles, the gradient is to be maintained from 
2 inches (5.1 cm) above the floor or supporting platform to a height one 
foot (30.5 cm) above the unit under test. Defrost controls are to be 
operative and the anti-sweat heater switch is to be ``on'' during one 
test and ``off'' during a second test. Other exceptions are noted in 
2.3, 2.4, and 5.1 below.
    2.3  Conditions for automatic defrost refrigerator-freezers. For 
automatic defrost refrigerator-freezers, the freezer compartments shall 
not be loaded with any frozen food packages. Cylindrical metallic masses 
of dimensions 1.12\\\<plus-minus>\\\0.25 inches (2.9<plus-minus>0.6 cm) 
in diameter and height shall be attached in good thermal contact with 
each temperature sensor within the refrigerated compartments. All 
temperature measuring sensor masses shall be supported by nonthermally 
conductive supports in such a manner that there will be at least one 
inch (2.5 cm) of air space separating the thermal mass from contact with 
any surface. In case of interference with hardware at the sensor 
locations specified in section 5.1, the sensors shall be placed at the 
nearest adjacent location such that there will be a one inch air space 
separating the sensor mass from the hardware.
    2.4  Conditions for all-refrigerators. There shall be no load in the 
freezer compartment during the test.
    2.5  Steady State Condition. Steady state conditions exist if the 
temperature measurements in all measured compartments taken at four 
minute intervals or less during a stabilization period are not changing 
at a rate greater than 0.042 deg. F. (0.023 deg. C.) per hour as 
determined by the applicable condition of A or B.
    A. The average of the measurements during a two hour period if no 
cycling occurs or during a number of complete repetitive compressor 
cycles through a period of no less than two hours is compare to the 
average over an equivalent time period with three hours elapsed between 
the two measurement periods.
    B. If A above cannot be used, the average of the measurements during 
a number of complete repetitive compressor cycles through a period of no 
less than two hours and including the last complete cycle prior to a 
defrost period, or if no cycling occurs, the average of the measurements 
during the last two hours prior to a defrost period; are compared to the 
same averaging period prior to the following defrost period.

                        3. Test Control Settings

    3.1  Model with no user operable temperature control. A test shall 
be performed during which the compartment temperatures and energy use 
shall be measured. A second test shall be performed with the temperature 
control electrically short circuited to cause the compressor to run 
continuously.
    3.2  Model with user operable temperature control. Testing shall be 
performed in accordance with one of the following sections using the 
standardized temperatures of:

All-refrigerator: 38 deg. F. (3.3 deg. C.) fresh food compartment 
temperature
Refrigerator: 15 deg. F. (-9.4 deg. C.) freezer compartment temperature
Refrigerator-freezer: 5 deg. F. (-15 deg. C.) freezer compartment 
temperature
    Variable defrost control models: 5 deg.F (-15 deg.C) freezer 
compartment temperature and 38<plus-minus>2 deg.F fresh food compartment 
temperature during steady-state conditions with no door-openings. If 
both settings cannot be obtained, then test with the fresh food 
compartment temperature at 38<plus-minus>2 deg.F and the freezer 
compartment as close to 5 deg.F as possible.

    3.2.1  A first test shall be performed with all compartment 
temperature controls set at their median position midway between their 
warmest and coldest settings. Knob detents shall be mechanically 
defeated if necessary to attain a median setting. A second test shall be 
performed with all controls set at either their warmest or their coldest 
setting (not electrically or mechanically bypassed), whichever is 
appropriate, to attempt to achieve compartment temperatures measured 
during the two tests which bound (i.e., one is above and one is below) 
the standardized temperature for the type of product being tested. If 
the compartment temperatures measured during these two tests bound the 
appropriate standardized temperature, then these test results shall be 
used to determine energy consumption. If the compartment temperature 
measured with all controls set at their coldest setting is above the 
standardized temperature, a third test shall be performed with all 
controls set at their warmest setting and the result of this test shall 
be used with the result of the test performed with all controls set at 
their coldest setting to determine energy consumption. If the 
compartment temperature measured with all controls set at their warmest 
setting is below the standardized temperature; and the fresh food 
compartment temperature is below 45 deg. F. (7.22 deg. C.) in the case 
of a refrigerator or a refrigerator-freezer, excluding an all-
refrigerator, then the result of this test alone will be used to 
determine energy consumption.
    3.2.2  Alternatively, a first test may be performed with all 
temperature controls set at their warmest setting. If the compartment 
temperature is below the appropriate standardized temperature, and the 
fresh food compartment temperature is below 45 deg. F. (7.22 deg. C.) in 
the case of a refrigerator or a refrigerator-freezer, excluding an all-
refrigerator, then the result of this test alone will

[[Page 125]]

be used to determine energy consumption. If the above conditions are not 
met, then the unit shall be tested in accordance with 3.2.1 above.
    3.2.3  Alternatively, a first test may be performed with all 
temperature controls set at their coldest setting. If the compartment 
temperature is above the appropriate standardized temperature, a second 
test shall be performed with all controls set at their warmest control 
setting and the results of these two tests shall be used to determine 
energy consumption. If the above condition is not met, then the unit 
shall be tested in accordance with 3.2.1 above.
    3.3  Variable defrost control optional test. After a steady-state 
condition is achieved, the optional test requires door-openings for 
12<plus-minus>2 seconds every 60 minutes on the fresh food compartment 
door and a simultaneous 12<plus-minus>2 second freezer compartment door-
opening occurring every 4th time, to obtain 24 fresh food and six 
freezer compartment door-openings per 24-hour period. The first freezer 
door-opening shall be simultaneous with the fourth fresh food door-
opening. The doors are to be opened 60 deg. to 90 deg. with an average 
velocity for the leading edge of the door of approximately 2 ft./sec. 
Prior to the initiation of the door-opening sequence, the refrigerator 
defrost control mechanism may be re-initiated in order to minimize the 
test duration.

                             4. Test Period

    4.1  Test Period. Tests shall be performed by establishing the 
conditions set forth in Section 2, and using control settings as set 
forth in Section 3, above.
    4.1.1  Nonautomatic Defrost. If the model being tested has no 
automatic defrost system, the test time period shall start after steady 
state conditions have been achieved and be of not less than three hours 
in duration. During the test period, the compressor motor shall complete 
two or more whole compressor cycles (a compressor cycle is a complete 
``on'' and a complete ``off'' period of the motor). If no ``off'' 
cycling will occur, as determined during the stabilization period, the 
test period shall be three hours. If incomplete cycling (less than two 
compressor cycles) occurs during a 24 hour period, the results of the 24 
hour period shall be used.
    4.1.2  Automatic Defrost. If the model being tested has an automatic 
defrost system, the test time period shall start after steady state 
conditions have been achieved and be from one point during a defrost 
period to the same point during the next defrost period. If the model 
being tested has a long-time automatic defrost system, the alternative 
provisions of 4.1.2.1 may be used.If the model being tested has a 
variable defrost control, the provisions of section 4.1.2.2 or 4.1.2.3 
shall apply. If the model has a dual compressor system the provisions of 
4.1.2.4 shall apply.
    4.1.2.1   Long-time Automatic Defrost. If the model being tested has 
a long-time automatic defrost system, the test time period may consist 
of two parts. A first part would be the same as the test for a unit 
having no defrost provisions (section 4.1.1). The second part would 
start when a defrost period is initiated during a compressor ``on'' 
cycle and terminate at the second turn ``on'' of the compressor motor or 
after four hours, whichever comes first.
    4.1.2.2  Variable defrost control. If the model being tested has a 
variable defrost control system, the test shall consist of three parts. 
Two parts shall be the same as the test for long-time automatic defrost 
(section 4.1.2.1). The third part is the optional test to determine the 
time between defrosts (section 5.2.1.3). The third part is used by 
manufacturers that choose not to accept the default value of F of 0.20, 
to calculate CT.
    4.1.2.3  Variable defrost control optional test. After steady-state 
conditions with no door openings are achieved in accordance with section 
3.3 above, the test is continued using the above daily door-opening 
sequence until stabilized operation is achieved. Stabilization is 
defined as a minimum of three consecutive defrost cycles with times 
between defrosts that will allow the calculation of a Mean Time Between 
Defrosts (MTBD1) that satisfies the statistical relationship of 90 
percent confidence. The test is repeated on at least one more unit of 
the model and until the Mean Time Between Defrosts for the multiple unit 
tests (MTBD2) satisfies the statistical relationship. If the time 
between defrosts is greater than 96 hours (compressor ``on'' time) and 
this defrost period can be repeated on a second unit, the test may be 
terminated at 96 hours (CT) and the absolute time value used for MTBD 
for each unit.
    4.1.2.4  Dual compressor systems with automatic defrost. If the 
model being tested has separate compressor systems for the refrigerator 
and freezer sections, each with its own automatic defrost system, then 
the two-part method in 4.1.2.1 shall be used. The second part of the 
method will be conducted separately for each automatic defrost system. 
The auxiliary components (fan motors, anti-sweat heaters, etc.) will be 
identified for each system and the energy consumption measured during 
each test.

                          5. Test Measurements

    5.1  Temperature Measurements. Temperature measurements shall be 
made at the locations prescribed in Figures 7.1 and 7.2 of HRF-1-1979 
and shall be accurate to within <plus-minus> 0.5 deg. F. (0.3 deg. C.) 
of true value. No freezer temperature measurements need be taken in an 
all-refrigerator model.

[[Page 126]]

    If the interior arrangements of the cabinet do not conform with 
those shown in Figure 7.1 and 7.2 of HRF-1-1979, measurements shall be 
taken at selected locations chosen to represent approximately the entire 
refrigerated compartment. The locations selected shall be a matter of 
record.
    5.1.1  Measured Temperature. The measured temperature of a 
compartment is to be the average of all sensor temperature readings 
taken in that compartment at a particular time. Measurements shall be 
taken at regular intervals not to exceed four minutes.
    5.1.2  Compartment Temperature. The compartment temperature for each 
test period shall be an average of the measured temperatures taken in a 
compartment during a complete cycle or several complete cycles of the 
compressor motor (one compressor cycle is one complete motor ``on'' and 
one complete motor ``off'' period). For long-time automatic defrost 
models, compartment temperatures shall be those measured in the first 
part of the test period specified in 4.1.1. For models equipped with 
variable defrost controls, compartment temperatures shall be those 
measured in the first part of the test period specified in 4.1.2.2 
above.
    5.1.2.1  The number of complete compressor motor cycles over which 
the measured temperatures in a compartment are to be averaged to 
determine compartment temperature shall be equal to the number of 
minutes between measured temperature readings, rounded up to the next 
whole minute or a number of complete cycles over a time period exceeding 
one hour. One of the cycles shall be the last complete compressor motor 
cycle during the test period.
    5.1.2.2  If no compressor motor cycling occurs, the compartment 
temperature shall be the average of the measured temperatures taken 
during the last thirty-two minutes of the test period.
    5.1.2.3  If incomplete cycling occurs, the compartment temperatures 
shall be the average of the measured temperatures taken during the last 
three hours of the last complete ``on'' period.
    5.2  Energy Measurements
    5.2.1  Per-day Energy Consumption. The energy consumption in 
kilowatt-hours per day for each test period shall be the energy expended 
during the test period as specified in section 4.1 adjusted to a 24 hour 
period. The adjustment shall be determined as follows:
    5.2.1.1  Nonautomatic and automatic defrost models. The energy 
consumption in kilowatt-hours per day shall be calculated equivalent to:

ET=EP x 1440/T
where
ET=test cycle energy expended in kilowatt-hours per day,
EP=energy expended in kilowatt-hours during the test period,
T=length of time of the test period in minutes, and
1440=conversion factor to adjust to a 24 hour period in minutes per day.

    5.2.1.2  Long-time Automatic Defrost. If the two part test method is 
used, the energy consumption in kilowatt-hours per day shall be 
calculated equivalent to:

ET=(1440 x EP1/T1)+((EP2-(EP1 x T2/T1)) x 12/CT)
where
ET and 1440 are defined in 5.2.1.1,
EP1=energy expended in kilowatt-hours during the first part of the test,
EP2=energy expended in kilowatt-hours during the second part of the 
          test,
T1 and T2=length of time in minutes of the first and second test parts 
          respectively,
CT=Defrost timer run time in hours required to cause it to go through a 
          complete cycle, to the nearest tenth hour per cycle, and
12=factor to adjust for a 50% run time of the compressor in hours per 
          day.
    5.2.1.3  Variable defrost control. The energy consumption in 
kilowatt-hours per day shall be calculated equivalent to:

ET=(1440 x EP1/T1)+(EP2-(EP1 x T2/T1)) x (12/CT) where 1440 is defined 
          in 5.2.1.1 and EP1, EP2, T1, T2 and 12 are defined in 5.2.1.2.
CT=CT<INF>L</INF> x CT<INF>M</INF>)/
          (F x (CT<INF>M</INF>-CT<INF>L</INF>)+CT<INF>L</INF>)
CT<INF>L</INF>=least or shortest time between defrosts in tenths of an 
          hour (greater than or equal to six but less than or equal to 
          12 hours)
CT<INF>M</INF>=maximum time between defrost cycles in tenths of an hour 
          (greater than CT<INF>L</INF> but not more than 96 hours)
F=ratio of per day energy consumption in excess of the least energy and 
          the maximum difference in per day energy consumption and is 
          equal to
F = (1/CT - 1/CT<INF>M</INF>)/(1/CT<INF>L</INF> - 1/CT<INF>M</INF> = 
          (ET-ET<INF>L</INF>)/ET<INF>M</INF> - ET<INF>L</INF>) or 0.20 
          in lieu of testing to find CT.
ET<INF>L</INF> = least electrical energy used (kilowatt hours)
ET<INF>M</INF>=maximum electrical energy used (kilowatt hours). For 
          demand defrost models with no values for CT<INF>L</INF> and 
          CT<INF>M</INF> in the algorithm the default values of 12 and 
          84 shall be used, respectively.

    5.2.1.4  Optional test method for variable defrost controls.
CT = MTBD x 0.5
where:

MTBD = mean time between defrosts

                                                                        
                                                      <greek-S> X       
          MTBD                     =         ---------------------------
                                                           N            
                                                                        


where:


[[Page 127]]


X=in time between defrost cycles
N=number of defrost cycles

    5.2.1.5  Dual compressor systems with dual automatic defrost. The 
two-part test method in section 4.1.2.2 must be used, the energy 
consumption in kilowatt per day shall be calculated equivalent to:

ET=(1440  x  EP1/T1) + (EP2<INF>F</INF> - (EP<INF>F</INF>  x  T2/T1)) 
          x  12/CT<INF>F</INF> + (EP2<INF>R</INF> - (EP<INF>R</INF>  x  
          T3/T1))  x  12/CT<INF>R</INF>

Where 1440, EP1, T1, EP2, 12, and CT are defined in 5.2.1.2
EP<INF>F</INF> = energy expended in kilowatt-hours during the second 
          part of the test for the freezer system by the freezer system.
EP2<INF>F</INF> = total energy expended during the second part of the 
          test for the freezer system.
EP<INF>R</INF> = energy expended in kilowatt-hours during the second 
          part of the test for the refrigerator system by the 
          refrigerator system.
EP2<INF>R</INF> = total energy expended during the second part of the 
          test for the refrigerator system.
T2 and T3 = length of time in minutes of the second test part for the 
          freezer and refrigerator systems respectively.
CT<INF>F</INF> = compressor ``on'' time between freezer defrosts (tenths 
          of an hour).
CT<INF>R</INF> = compressor ``on'' time between refrigerator defrosts 
          (tenths of an hour).

    5.3  Volume measurements. The electric refrigerator or electric 
refrigerator-freezer total refrigerated volume, VT, shall be measured in 
accordance with HRF-1-1979, section 3.20 and sections 4.2 through 4.3 
and be calculated equivalent to:

VT=VF+VFF
where
VT=total refrigerated volume in cubic feet,
VF=freezer compartment volume in cubic feet, and
VFF=fresh food compartment volume in cubic feet.

        6. Calculation of Derived Results from Test Measurements

Appendix B1 to Subpart B of Part 430--Uniform Test Method for Measuring 
                   the Energy Consumption of Freezers

                             1. Definitions.

    1.1  ``HRF-1-1979'' means the Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers standard for household refrigerators, combination 
refrigerators-freezers, and household freezers, also approved as an 
American National Standard as a revision of ANSI B38.1-1970.
    1.2  ``Anti-sweat heater'' means a device incorporated into the 
design of a freezer to prevent the accumulation of moisture on exterior 
surfaces of the cabinet under conditions of high ambient humidity.
    1.3  ``Cycle'' means the period of 24 hours for which the energy use 
of a freezer is calculated as though the consumer-activated compartment 
temperature controls were preset so that the desired compartment 
temperatures were maintained.
    1.4  ``Cycle type'' means the set of test conditions having the 
calculated effect of operating a freezer for a period of 24 hours with 
the consumer-activated controls other than the compartment temperature 
control set to establish various operating characteristics.
    1.5  ``Standard cycle'' means the cycle type in which the anti-sweat 
heater switch, when provided, is set in the highest energy consuming 
position.
    1.6  ``Adjusted total volume'' means the product of, (1) the freezer 
volume as defined in HRF-1-1979 in cubic feet, times (2) an adjustment 
factor.
    1.7  ``Automatic Defrost'' means a system in which the defrost cycle 
is automatically initiated and terminated, with resumption of normal 
refrigeration at the conclusion of defrost operation. The system 
automatically prevents the permanent formation of frost on all 
refrigerated surfaces. Nominal refrigerated food temperatures are 
maintained during the operation of the automatic defrost system.
    1.8  ``Long-time Automatic Defrost'' means an automatic defrost 
system where successive defrost cycles are separated by 14 hours or more

variable or variables other than solely compressor operating time. This 
includes any electrical or mechanical device. Demand defrost is a type 
of variable defrost control.
    1.11  ``Quick freeze'' means an optional feature on freezers which 
is initiated manually and shut off manually. It bypasses the thermostat 
control and places the compressor in a steady-state operating condition 
until it is shut off.

                           2. Test Conditions.

    2.1  Ambient temperature. The ambient temperature shall be 
90.0<plus-minus>1.0 deg. F. (32.2<plus-minus>0.6 deg. C.) during the 
stabilization period and during the test period. The ambient temperature 
shall be 80<plus-minus>2 deg.F dry bulb and 67 deg.F wet bulb during the 
stabilization period and during the test period when the unit is tested 
in accordance with section 3.3.
    2.2  Operational conditions. The freezer shall be installed and its 
operating conditions maintained in accordance with HRF-1-1979, section 
7.2 through section 7.4.3.3, except that the vertical ambient gradient 
at locations 10 inches (25.4 cm) out from the the centers of the two 
sides of the unit being tested is to be maintained during the test. 
Unless the area is obstructed by shields or baffles, the gradient is to

temperature measurements taken at four minute intervals or less during a 
stabilization period are not changing at a rate greater than 0.042 deg. 
F. (0.023 deg. C.) per hour as determined by the applicable condition of 
A or B.

[[Page 129]]

A--The average of the measurements during a two hour period if no 
          cycling occurs or during a number of complete repetitive 
          compressor cycles through a period of no less than two hours 
          is compared to the average over an equivalent time period with 
          three hours elapsed between the two measurement periods.
B--If A above cannot be used, the average of the measurements during a 
          number of complete repetitive compressor cycles through a 
          period of no less than two hours and including the last 
          complete cycle prior to a defrost period, or if no cycling 
          occurs, the average of the measurements during the last two 
          hours prior to a defrost period; are compared to the same 
          averaging period prior to the following defrost period.

                        3. Test Control Settings.

    3.1  Model with no user operable temperature control. A test shall 
be performed during which the compartment temperature and energy use 
shall be measured. A second test shall be performed with the temperature 
control electrically short circuited to cause the compressor to run 
continuously. If the model has the quick freeze option, it is to be used 
to bypass the temperature control.
    3.2  Model with user operable temperature control. Testing shall be 
performed in accordance with one of the following sections using the 
standardized temperature of 0.0 deg. F. (-17.8 deg. C.). Variable 
defrost control models shall achieve 0<plus-minus>2 deg.F during the 
steady-state conditions prior to the optional test with no door 
openings.
    3.2.1  A first test shall be performed with all temperature controls 
set at their median position midway between their warmest and coldest 
settings. Knob detents shall be mechanically defeated if necessary to 
attain a median setting. A second test shall be performed with all 
controls set at either their warmest or their coldest setting (not 
electrically or mechanically bypassed), whichever is appropriate, to 
attempt to achieve compartment temperatures measured during the two 
tests which bound (i.e., one is above and one is below) the standardized 
temperature. If the compartment temperatures measured during these two 
tests bound the standardized temperature, then these test results shall 
be used to determine energy consumption. If the compartment temperature 
measured with all controls set at their coldest setting is above the 
standardized temperature, a third test shall be performed with all 
controls set at their warmest setting and the result of this test shall 
be used with the result of the test performed with all controls set at 
their coldest setting to determine energy consumption. If the 
compartment temperature measured with all controls set at their warmest 
setting is below the standardized temperature; then the result of this 
test alone will be used to determine energy consumption.
    3.2.2  Alternatively, a first test may be performed with all 
temperature controls set at their warmest setting. If the compartment 
temperature is below the standardized temperature, then the result of 
this test alone will be used to determine energy consumption. If the 
above condition is not met, then the unit shall be tested in accordance 
with 3.2.1 above.
    3.2.3  Alternatively, a first test may be performed with all 
temperature controls set at their coldest setting. If the compartment 
temperature is above the standardized temperature, a second test shall 
be performed with all controls set at their warmest setting and the 
results of these two tests shall be used to determine energy 
consumption. If the above condition is not met, then the unit shall be 
tested in accordance with 3.2.1 above.
    3.3 Variable defrost control optional test. After a steady-state 
condition is achieved, the door-opening sequence is initiated with an 
18<plus-minus>2 second freezer door-opening occurring every eight hours 
to obtain three door-openings per 24-hour period. The first freezer 
door-opening shall occur at the initiation of the test period. The 
door(s) are to be opened 60 to 90 deg. with an average velocity for the 
leading edge of the door of approximately two feet per second. Prior to 
the initiation of the door-opening sequence, the freezer defrost control 
mechanism may be re-initiated in order to minimize the test duration.

                             4. Test Period.

    4.1  Test Period. Tests shall be performed by establishing the 
conditions set forth in Section 2 and using control settings as set 
forth in Section 3 above.
    4.1.1  Nonautomatic Defrost. If the model being tested has no 
automatic defrost system, the test time period shall start after steady 
state conditions have been achieved, and be of not less than three 
hours' duration. During the test period the compressor motor shall 
complete two or more whole cycles (a compressor cycle is a complete 
``on'' and a complete ``off'' period of the motor). If no ``off'' 
cycling will occur, as determined during the stabilization period, the 
test period shall be three hours. If incomplete cycling (less than two 
compressor cycles) occurs during a 24 hour period, the results of the 24 
hour period shall be used.
    4.1.2  Automatic Defrost. If the model being tested has an automatic 
defrost system, the test time period shall start after steady state 
conditions have been achieved and be from one point during a defrost 
period to the same point during the next defrost period. If the model 
being tested has a long-time automatic defrost system, the alternate 
provisions of 4.1.2.1 may be used. If the model

[[Page 130]]

being tested has a variable defrost control the provisions of 4.1.2.2. 
shall apply.
    4.1.2.1  Long-time Automatic Defrost. If the model being tested has 
a long-time automatic defrost system, the test time period may consist 
of two parts. A first part would be the same as the test for a unit 
having no defrost provisions (section 4.1.1). The second part would 
start when a defrost period is initiated during a compressor ``on'' 
cycle and terminate at the second turn ``on'' of the compressor motor or 
after four hours, whichever comes first.
    4.1.2.2 Variable defrost control. If the model being tested has a 
variable defrost control system, the test shall consist of three parts. 
Two parts shall be the same as the test for long-time automatic defrost 
in accordance with section 4.1.2.1 above. The third part is the optional 
test to determine the time between defrosts (5.2.1.3). The third part is 
used by manufacturers that choose not to accept the default value of F 
of 0.20, to calculate CT.
    4.1.2.3 Variable defrost control optional test. After steady-state 
conditions with no door-openings are achieved in accordance with section 
3.3 above, the test is continued using the above daily door-opening 
sequence until stabilized operation is achieved. Stabilization is 
defined as a minimum of three consecutive defrost cycles with times 
between defrost that will allow the calculation of a Mean Time Between 
Defrosts (MTBD1) that satisfies the statistical relationship of 90 
percent confidence. The test is repeated on at least one more unit of 
the model and until the Mean Time Between Defrosts for the multiple unit 
test (MTBD2) satisfies the statistical relationship. If the time between 
defrosts is greater than 96 hours (compressor ``on'' time) and this 
defrost period can be repeated on a second unit, the test may be 
terminated at 96 hours (CT) and the absolute time value used for MTBD 
for each unit.

                          5. Test Measurements.

    5.1  Temperature Measurements. Temperature measurements shall be 
made at the locations prescribed in Figure 7-2 of HRF-1-1979 and shall 
be accurate to within <plus-minus>0.5 deg. F. (0.3 deg. C.) of true 
value.
    5.1.1  Measured Temperature. The measured temperature is to be the 
average of all sensor temperature readings taken at a particular time. 
Measurements shall be taken at regular intervals not to exceed four 
minutes.
    5.1.2  Compartment Temperature. The compartment temperature for each 
test period shall be an average of the measured temperatures taken 
during a complete cycle or several complete cycles of the compressor 
motor (one compressor cycle is one complete motor ``on'' and one 
complete motor ``off'' period). For long-time automatic defrost models, 
compartment temperature shall be that measured in the first part of the 
test period specified in 4.1.1. For models equipped with variable 
defrost controls, compartment temperatures shall be those measured in 
the first part of the test period specified in 4.1.2.2.
    5.1.2.1  The number of complete compressor motor cycles over which 
the measured temperatures in a compartment are to be averaged to 
determine compartment temperature shall be equal to the number of 
minutes between measured temperature readings rounded up to the next 
whole minute or a number of complete cycles over a time period exceeding 
one hour. One of the cycles shall be the last complete compressor motor 
cycles during the test period.
    5.1.2.2  If no compressor motor cycling occurs, the compartment 
temperature shall be the average of the measured temperatures taken 
during the last thirty-two minutes of the test period.
    5.1.2.3  If incomplete cycling occurs (less than one cycle) the 
compartment temperature shall be the average of all readings taken 
during the last three hours of the last complete ``on'' period.

          hours per day, and
T1 and T2=length of time in minutes of the first and second test parts 
          respectively.

    5.2.1.3 Variable defrost control. The energy consumption in 
kilowatt-hours per day shall be calculated equivalent to:

          defined in 5.2.1.1 and EP1, EP2, T1, T2 and 12 are defined in 
          5.2.1.2.

          CT<INF>L</INF>) + CT<INF>L</INF>)
where:

F=ratio of per day energy consumption in excess of the least energy and 
          the maximum difference in per day energy consumption and is 
          equal to
F=(1/CT - 1/CT<INF>M</INF>)/(1/CT<INF>L</INF> - 1/CT<INF>M</INF>) = (ET 
          - ET<INF>L</INF>)/(ET<INF>M</INF> - ET<INF>L</INF>) or 0.20 in 
          lieu of testing to find CT

used, respectively.
    5.2.1.4 Variable defrost control optional test. Perform the optional 
test for variable defrost control models to find CT.
CT=MTBD x 0.5
MTBD=mean time between defrost

freezers under test shall be defined as:

VA=VT x CF
where
VA=adjusted total volume in cubic feet,
VT=total refrigerated volume in cubic feet, and
CF=Correction factor of 1.73, dimensionless.

    6.2  Average Per Cycle Energy Consumption:
    6.2.1  The average per-cycle energy consumption for a cycle type is 
expressed in kilowatt-hours per cycle to the nearest one hundredth 
(0.01) kilowatt-hour and shall depend upon the compartment temperature 
attainable as shown below.

                   3. test procedures and measurements

    3.1  Drum capacity. Measure the drum capacity by sealing all 
openings in the drum except the loading port with a plastic bag, and 
ensure that all corners and depressions are filled and that there are no 
extrusions of the plastic bag through the opening in the drum. Support 
the dryer's rear drum surface on a platform scale to prevent deflection 
of the dryer, and record the weight of the empty dryer. Fill the drum 
with water to a level determined by the intersection of the door plane 
and the loading port. Record the temperature of the water and then the 
weight of the dryer with the added water and then determine the mass of 
the water in pounds. Add or subtract the appropriate volume depending on 
whether or not the plastic bag protrudes into the drum interior. The 
drum capacity is calculated as follows:

C=w/d

0.87 <plus-minus> .01 as determined in accordance with section 6.1.7 
with two 4.5 kW heating elements controlled in such a manner as to 
prevent both elements from operating simultaneously.

                           5. Test Procedures

    5.1. Storage Tank and Heat Pump Water Heaters.
    5.1.1. Determination of Storage Tank Volume. Determine the storage 
capacity, V<INF>st</INF>, of the water heater under test, in gallons, by 
subtracting the tare weight--measured while the tank is empty--from the 
gross weight of the storage tank completely filled with water with all 
air eliminated and line pressure applied as described in section 2.5. 
and dividing the resulting net weight by the density of water at the 
appropriate temperature.
    5.1.2. Setting the Thermostat for a Thermostatically Operated Water 
Heater. Starting with a tank of supply water, initiate normal operation 
of the water heater. After cutout, observe the mean tank temperature 
(based on the six temperature sensors) every minute until the maximum 
value is observed. Determine whether this maximum value of the mean tank 
temperature is within the range of 135 deg.F <plus-minus>5 deg.F. If 
not, turn off the water heater, adjust the thermostat, and refill the 
tank with supply water. Then, initiate normal operation of the water 
heater, and once again determine the maximum mean tank temperature after 
cut-out. Repeat this sequence until the maximum mean tank temperature 
after cut-out is within the

[[Page 143]]

range of 135 deg.F <plus-minus>5 deg.F. If a water heater has two 
thermostats, the thermostat which controls the upper heating element 
shall be set first to yield a maximum water temperature of 135 deg.F 
<plus-minus>5 deg.F as measured by the temperature tank sensors above 
the upper heating element. The thermostat which controls the lower 
heating element shall then be set to yield a maximum mean tank 
temperature of 135 deg.F <plus-minus>5 deg.F. For heat pump water 
heaters, which control an auxiliary resistance element, the thermostat 
shall be set in accordance with the manufacturer's installation 
instructions.
    5.1.3. Power Input Determination. For all water heaters except 
electric types having immersed heating elements and initiate normal 
operation and determine the power input, P, to the main burners 
(including pilot light power, if any) after 15 minutes of operation. If 
the water heater is equipped with a gas appliance pressure regulator, 
the regulator outlet pressure shall be set within <plus-minus>10% of 
that recommended by the manufacturer. For oil fired water heaters the 
fuel pump pressure shall be within <plus-minus>10% of the manufacturer's 
specified pump pressure. All burners shall be adjusted to achieve an 
hourly Btu rating that is within <plus-minus>2% of the value specified 
by the manufacturer. For an oil-fired water heater, adjust the burner to 
give a CO<INF>2</INF> reading recommended by the manufacturer and an 
hourly Btu rating that is within <plus-minus>2% of that specified by the 
manufacturer. Smoke in the flue may not exceed No. 1 smoke as measured 
by the procedure in ASTM-D-2156-80. Gas- and oil-fired water 
instantaneous water heaters shall have the burners adjusted to the 
manufacture's maximum firing rate value.
    5.1.4. First Hour Rating Test. Establish normal water heater 
operation with the maximum mean tank temperature within the range 
specified in section 2.1.4. Begin the first hour rating test after the 
thermostat has acted to reduce the electrical power or fuel input to the 
water heater and the maximum storage tank temperature has been achieved. 
If the water heater incorporates a heat-pump, wait until both the heat 
pump and electrical heating element(s) have ceased to supply energy to 
the storage tank. Record the time, oil, gas and/or electrical meter 
readings as appropriate. Do not interrupt electrical power and/or fuel 
to the water heater. The rate of water withdrawal shall be 
3.00<plus-minus>0.25 gallons per minute. Draw and collect water 
withdrawn from the water heater in a suitable container for the purpose 
of determining its weight at the conclusion of the test. During the draw 
record the inlet and outlet fluid temperature beginning 15 seconds after 
the start and at every subsequent 5 second interval throughout the 
duration of each draw. Alternatively, a water meter may be used to 
directly measure the volume of water withdrawn. Record the maximum 
outlet temperature which occurs during the draw as T<INF>max</INF>. The 
withdrawal of water shall continue until the outlet temperature drops to 
a value 25 deg.F below T<INF>max</INF>, defined as T<INF>min</INF>, at 
which time the draw shall be terminated. Record the average outlet 
temperature and mass removed as T<INF>del,i</INF> and M<INF>i</INF>, 
respectively. If the thermostat acts to reduce the supply of fuel to the 
main burner or electrical input to the upper heating element of a 
multiple element electric water heater, or electrical input to a water 
heater having a single element or multiple elements which operate 
simultaneously, before one hour has elapsed, initiate a second draw. 
During the draw record the outlet fluid temperatures beginning 15 
seconds after initiating the draw and at every subsequent 5 second 
interval throughout the duration of each draw until the outlet 
temperature drops to T<INF>min</INF>, at which time the draw is 
terminated. Record the average outlet temperatures as well as the mass 
removed. Continue this sequence of events until one hour has elapsed. If 
a draw is currently taking place, continue the draw until the outlet 
temperature reaches T<INF>min</INF>, and record the elasped time between 
the previously recorded time, at the beginning of the first draw, and 
the termination of this final draw as <greek-t><INF>fhr</INF>. If a draw 
is not taking place at the end of one hour, wait until the thermostat 
acts to reduce the supply of fuel to the main burner or electrical input 
to the upper heating element of a multiple element electric water 
heater, or electrical input to a water heater having a single element or 
multiple elements which operate simultaneously, to initiate the final 
draw. During the final draw, record the outlet fluid temperature 
beginning 15 seconds after initiating the draw and at every subsequent 5 
second intervals throughout the duration of the draw until the outlet 
temperature drops to T<INF>min</INF>, at which time the draw is 
terminated. Record the elasped time between the previously recorded 
time, at the beginning of the first draw, and the termination of the 
final draw as <greek-t><INF>fhr</INF>. In either case, record the outlet 
temperatures and the mass removed during the final draw.
    5.1.5. 24 Hour Simulated Use Test. During the simulated use test, a 
total of 64.3 gallons are removed. With the water heater turned off, 
fill the water heater with supply water and apply pressure as described 
in section 2.1.5. Turn on the water heater and associated heat pump 
unit, if present. Wait until cutout occurs at 135 deg.F 
<plus-minus>5 deg.F, as specified in section 2.1.4. After the cutout 
occurs, measure the mean tank temperature using the temperature sensors 
described in section 4.5 every minute until the maximum mean storage 
tank temperature is achieved. The water heater may be operated through 
up to three successive cycles of drawing 10 gallons per draw, permitting 
recovery between each draw, prior to the start of the test. Record at

[[Page 144]]

this time (designated as <greek-t>=0), the mean tank temperature 
(T<INF>o</INF>), and the oil, gas, and electrical energy measurements as 
appropriate. Begin the 24 hour simulated use test by drawing an amount 
of water out of the water heater equivalent to one-sixth of the daily 
hot water usage, 64.3 gallons. Record the average storage tank and 
ambient temperature every 15 minutes throughout the 24 hour simulated 
use test unless recovery or a draw is occurring. At elapsed time 
intervals of one, two, three, four and five hours from <greek-t>=0), 
initiate additional draws removing an amount of water equivalent to one-
sixth of 64.3 gallons, with the maximum allowable deviation for any 
single draw being <plus-minus>0.5 gallons. The quantity of water drawn 
during the sixth draw shall be increased or decreased as necessary such 
that the total volume of water withdrawn shall be equal to 
64.3<plus-minus>1.0 gallons.
    All draws during the simulated use test are to be made at flow rates 
of 3.0<plus-minus>3.0 gallons per minute. Measurements of the inlet and 
outlet temperatures shall be made beginning 15 seconds after the draw is 
initiated and at every subsequent 5 second interval throughout the 
duration of each draw. The arithmetic mean of the hot water discharge 
temperature and the cold water inlet temperature shall be determined for 
each draw. Record the scale or meter reading, as appropriate, after each 
draw. At the end of the recovery period following the first draw, record 
the maximum mean tank temperature observed after cut-out, 
T<INF>max,1</INF>, and the energy consumed, Q<INF>r</INF> for oil, gas, 
and heat pump water heaters including auxiliary energy such as pilot 
lights, pumps, fans, etc. For heat pump water heaters Q<INF>r</INF>, is 
the sum of the energy consumed by the heat pump and the electrical 
heating elements(s).
    At the end of the recovery period following the sixth draw, record 
the total electric and/or fuel energy consumption, Q<INF>su</INF>, and 
the scale reading or the meter reading, as appropriate. If a water scale 
is used, determine the net weight of the water withdrawn, 
M<INF>FHR</INF> in pounds. Record the maximum value of the mean tank 
temperature after cutout as T<INF>su</INF>. Except as noted below, allow 
the water heater to remain in the standby mode until 24 hours have 
elapsed from the start of the test, <INF>t</INF>=0. Prevent the water 
heater from beginning a recovery cycle during the last hour of the test 
by turning off the electric power to the electrical heating elements and 
heat pump, if present, or by turning down the fuel supply to the main 
burner at an elapsed time of 23 hours. If a recovery is taking place at 
an elapsed time of 23 hours, wait until the recovery is complete before 
reducing the electrical and/or fuel supply to the water heater. At 24 
hours, record the mean tank temperature, T<INF>24, </INF>and the 
electric and/or fuel instrument readings. Determine the total energy 
consumption during the entire 24 hour simulated use test, Q. Record the 
time interval between the time at which the maximum mean tank 
temperature is observed after the sixth draw and the end of the 24 hour 
test as 
<greek-t><INF><greek-s><greek-t><greek-b><greek-u>,</INF><INF>1</INF>. 
Record the time during which water was not being withdrawn from the 
water heater during the entire 24 hour period as 
<greek-t><INF><greek-s><greek-t><greek-b><greek-u>,</INF><INF>2</INF>.

                     5.2 Instantaneous Water Heaters

    5.2.1. Setting the Outlet Discharge Temperature. Initiate normal 
operation of the water heater at the full input rating. Monitor the 
discharge water temperature and set to a value of 135 deg.F <plus-minus> 
5 deg.F in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. If the water 
heater is not capable of providing 3.00 <plus-minus> 0.25 gallons per 
minute then adjust the flow rate as necessary to achieve the specified 
discharge water temperature. Record the corresponding flow rate as 
V<INF>max</INF>. If the instantaneous water heater incorporates a 
controller which permits continous burner operation at a reduced input 
rate, adjust the flow rate as necessary to achieve a discharge water 
temperature of 135 deg. <plus-minus> 5 deg.F while maintaining the 
minimum input rate. Record the corresponding flow rate, V<INF>min</INF>. 
If an outlet temperature of 135 deg. <plus-minus> 5 deg.F cannot be 
achieved at the minimum allowable flow rate permitted by the 
instantaneous water heater, record the flow rate as V<INF>min</INF> and 
the outlet temperature as T<INF>min</INF>.
    5.2.2. Power Input Determination. For oil and gas flow actuated 
water heaters, adjust the burners to the maximum firing rate value 
specified by the manufacturer.
    5.2.3. First Hour Rating Test for Instantaneous Water Heaters. 
Establish normal heater operation at the maximum input rate with the 
discharge water temperature set in accordance with section 5.2.1. Record 
the time, oil, and/or gas meters as appropriate. Do not interrupt 
electrical or fuel to the water heater. Draw and collect water withdrawn 
from the water heater, while recording the inlet and outlet fluid 
temperatures beginning 15 seconds after the draw is initiated and at 
every subsequent 5 second interval throughout the duration of the draw 
in a suitable container for the purpose of determining its weight at the 
conclusion of the test. Alternatively, a water meter may be used to 
directly measure the value of water withdrawn. At the end of one hour 
terminate the draw. Determine the mass of water withdrawn, 
M<INF>FHR</INF>, in pounds, or the volume of water withdrawn, 
V<INF>FHR</INF>, in gallons with an error no greater than 2 percent.

                    5.2.4. 24 Hour Simulated Use Test

    5.2.4.1. Fixed Input Instantaneous Water Heaters. Establish normal 
operation with the discharge water temperature and flow rate set to 
values of 135 deg.F <plus-minus> 5 deg.F and V<INF>max</INF>, 
respectively. Record the oil, gas, and electrical energy measurements, 
as appropriate. Begin

the 24 hour simulated use test by drawing an amount of water out of the 
water heater equivalent to one-sixth of the daily not water usage, 64.3 
gallons. At elapsed time intervals of one, two, three, four, and five 
hours from <greek-t>=0, initiate additional draws removing an amount of 
water equivalent to one-sixth of 64.3 gallons, with the maximum 
allowable deviation for any single draw being <plus-minus> 0.5 gallons. 
The quantity of water drawn during the sixth draw shall be increased or 
decreased as necessary such that the total volume of water withdrawn 
shall be equal to 64.3<plus-minus>1.0 gallons. Measurements of the inlet 
and outlet water temperatures shall be made beginning 15 seconds after 
the draw is initiated and at every 5 second interval throughout the 
duration of the draw. The arithmetic mean of the hot water discharge 
temperature and the cold water inlet temperature shall be determined for 
each draw. Record the scale or meter reading, as appropriate, after each 
draw. At the end of the recovery period following the first draw, record 
the energy consumed, Q<INF>r</INF>. Allow the water heater to remain in 
the standby mode until exactly 24 hours have elapsed from the start of 
the test, <greek-t>=0. At 24 hours, record the electric and/or fuel 
instrument readings. Determine the energy consumption during the entire 
24 hour simulated use test, Q.
    5.2.4.2. Variable Input Instantaneous Water Heaters. If the 
instantaneous water heater incorporates a controller which permits 
continuous burner operation at a reduced input rate, the first three 
draws shall be conducted using the maximum flow rate, V<INF>max</INF>, 
while removing an amount of water equivalent to one-sixth of 64.3 
gallons, with the maximum allowable deviation for any one of the three 
draws being <plus-minus> 0.5 gallons. The second three draws shall be 
conducted at V<INF>min</INF>. If an outlet temperature of 135 deg. 
<plus-minus> 5 deg.F could not be achieved at the minimum flow rate 
permitted by the instantaneous water heater, the last three draws should 
be lengthened such that the volume removed is equivalent to

with the maximun allowable definition for any one of the three draws 
being <plus-minus> 0.5 gallons. The quantity of water drawn during the 
sixth draw shall be increased or decreased as necessary such that the 
total volume of water withdrawn shall be equal to 32.15 + 
3*V<INF>4,5,6</INF><plus-minus>1.0 gallons. Measurements of the inlet 
and outlet water temperatures shall be made beginning 15 seconds after 
the draw is initiated and at every 5 second interval throughout the 
duration of the draw. Determine the arithmetic mean of the hot water 
discharge temperature and the cold water inlet temperature for each 
draw. Record the scale or meter reading, as appropriate, after each 
draw. At the end of the recovery period following the first draw, record 
the energy consumption, Q<INF>r, max</INF>. Record the energy consumed 
prior to the fourth draw and at the end of the recovery period following 
the fourth draw, Q<INF>r, min</INF>.
    Allow the water heater to remain in the standby mode until exactly 
24 hours have elapsed from the start of the test, <greek-t>=0. At 24 
hours, record the electric and/or fuel instrument readings. Determine 
the energy consumption during the entire 24 hours simulated use test, Q.

          24 hours simulated use test,  deg.F

          hours simulated use test, recorded one minute before the first 
          draw is initiated  deg.F

          heater, dimensionless.
    6.1.6. Adjusted Daily Water Heating Energy Consumption. The adjusted 
daily water heating energy consumption, Q<INF>da</INF> takes into 
account that the temperature difference between the storage tank and 
surrounding ambient temperature may not be the nominal value of 
67.5 deg.F (135 deg.F - 67.5 deg.F) due to the 10 deg.F allowable 
variation in storage tank temperature, 135 <plus-minus> 5 deg.F, and the 
5 deg.F allowable variation in surrounding ambient temperature 65 deg.F 
to 70 deg.F. The adjusted daily water heating energy consumption is 
computed as

      Q<INF>da</INF>=Q<INF>d</INF>-
  
[(T<INF>stby</INF>-T<INF>a,stby</INF>]-(135 deg.F-67.5 deg.F)]UA<greek-t>

          portion, <greek-t><INF>stby,2</INF>, of the 24 hour test,

          standby portion, <greek-t><INF>stby,2</INF>, of the 24 hour 
          test,  deg.F

          simulated test when water was not being withdrawn from the 
          water heater
    A modification is also needed to take into account that the 
temperature difference between the outlet water temperature and supply 
water temperature may not be equivalent to the nominal value of 77 deg.F 
(135 deg.F-58 deg.F). The following equations adjust the experimental 
data to a nominal 77 deg.F temperature rise.
    The energy used to heat water, Btu per day, may be computed as--

temperature may not be equivalent to the nominal value of 77  deg.F (135 
 deg.F-58  deg.F). The following equations adjust the experimental data 
to a nominal 77  deg.F temperature rise.
    The energy used to heat water may be computed as--

                                                    i=1             <greek-ee><INF>r                                 
                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                

    The difference between these two values is--

      Q<INF>HWD</INF>=Q<INF>HW,77</INF>-Q<INF>HW</INF>

which must be added to the daily water heating energy consumption value. 
Thus, the daily energy consumption value which takes into account that 
the temperature rise across the storage tank may not be 77  deg.F is--

      Q<INF>am</INF>=Q<INF>a</INF>+Q<INF>HWD</INF>

                     7. Ratings for Untested Models

    In order to relieve the test burden to manufacturers who offer water 
heaters which differ only in fuel type or power input, ratings for 
untested models may be established in accordance with the following 
procedures. In lieu of the following procedures a manufacturer may elect 
to test the unit for which a rating is sought.
    7.1. Gas Water Heaters. Ratings obtained for gas water heaters using 
natural gas can be used for an identical water heater which utilizes 
propane gas if the input ratings are within 10 percent.

                       7.2. Electric Water Heaters

    7.2.1. First Hour Rating. If an electric storage type water heater 
is available with more than one input rating, the manufacturer shall 
designate the standard input rating and the water heater need only be 
tested with heating elements at the designated standard input ratings. 
The first hour ratings for units having power input rating less than the 
designated standard input rating shall be assigned a first hour rating 
equivalent to the first draw of the first hour rating for the electric 
water heater with the standard input rating. For units having power 
inputs greater than the designated standard input rating, the first hour 
rating shall be equivalent to that measured for the water heater with 
the standard input rating.
    7.2.2. Energy Factor. The energy factor for identical electric 
storage type water heaters, with the exception of heating element 
wattage, may use the energy factor obtained during testing of the water 
heater with the designated standard input rating.

    3.1  Test methods.
    3.1.1  Conventional oven. Perform a test by establishing the testing 
conditions set forth in 2 of this appendix, and adjust any pilot lights 
of a conventional gas oven in accordance with the manufacturer's 
instructions and turn off the gas flow to the conventional cooking top, 
if so equipped.
    Before beginning the test, the conventional oven shall be at its 
normal nonoperating temperature as defined in 1.5 and described in 2.6. 
Set the conventional oven test block W<INF>1</INF> approximately in the 
center of the usable baking space. If there is a selector switch for 
selecting the mode of operation of the oven, set for normal baking. If 
an oven permits baking by either forced convention using a fan, or 
without forced convection, the oven is to be tested in each of those two 
modes. If the oven thermostat does not cycle on and off, adjust or 
determine the conventional electric oven thermostat setting to provide 
an average internal temperature which is 325 deg. 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 deg. F higher than the room ambient air 
temperature. If the oven thermostat operates by cycling on and off, 
adjust or determine the conventional electric oven thermostat setting to 
provide an average internal temperature which is 325 deg. 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 deg. of higher than the room ambient air 
temperature. If the oven thermostat operates by cycling on and off, the 
oven shall remain on for at least one complete thermostat ``cut-off/cut-
on'' of the electrical resistance heaters or gas burners after the test 
block temperature has increased 234 deg. F above its initial 
temperature.
    3.1.1.1  Self-cleaning operation of a conventional oven. Perform a 
test by establishing the test conditions set forth in 2 of this 
appendix. Adjust any pilot lights of a conventional gas oven in 
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and turn off the gas 
flow to the conventional cooking top. The temperature of the 
conventional oven shall be its normal nonoperating temperature as 
defined in 1.5 and described in 2.6. Then set the conventional oven's 
self-cleaning process in accordance with the manufacturer's 
instructions. If the self-cleaning process is adjustable, use the 
average time recommended by the manufacturer for a moderately soiled 
oven.
    3.1.1.2  Continuously burning pilot lights of a conventional gas 
oven. Perform a test by establishing the test conditions set forth in 2 
of this appendix. Adjust any pilot lights of a conventional gas oven in 
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and turn off the gas 
flow to the conventional cooking top. If a positive displacement gas 
meter is used the test duration shall be sufficient to measure a gas 
consumption which is at least 200 times the resolution of the gas meter.
    3.1.2  Conventional cooking top. Perform a test by establishing the 
test conditions set forth in 2 of this Appendix. Adjust any pilot lights 
of a conventional gas cooking top in accordance with the manufacturer's 
instructions and turn off the gas flow to the conventional oven(s), if 
so equipped. The temperature of the conventional cooking top shall be 
its normal nonoperating temperature as defined in 1.5 and described in 
2.6. Set the test

inches or less in diameter. The large test block, W<INF>3</INF>, shall 
be used on electric surface units over 7 inches in diameter and on all 
gas surface units. Turn on the surface unit under test and set its 
energy input rate to the maximum setting (100 percent). When the test 
block reaches 144 deg.F above its initial test block temperature, 
immediately reduce the energy input rate to 25<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 
percent of the maximum energy input rate. After 
15<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.1 minutes at the reduced energy setting, turn 
off the surface unit under test.
    3.1.2.1  Continuously burning pilot lights of a conventional gas 
cooking top. Perform a test by establishing the test conditions set 
forth in 2 of this Appendix. Adjust any pilot lights of a conventional 
gas cooking top in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and 
turn off the gas flow to the conventional oven(s). If a positive 
displacement gas meter is used the test duration shall be sufficient to 
measure a gas consumption which is at least 200 times the resolution of 
the gas meter.
    3.1.3  Microwave oven. Perform the tests by establishing the testing 
conditions set forth in 2 of this Appendix. Four tests are to be 
conducted with the water test loads in the following sequence: 2,000 ml, 
1,000 ml, 500 ml and 275 ml. For each test, place the appropriate test 
beaker(s) containing the water load specified in 2.8.2 in approximately 
the center of the load carrying surface of the oven, and operate the 
microwave oven at its maximum microwave power setting until the 
temperature of the water load has been raised 
45<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>9 deg. F. Allow one minute for changing the test 
load beakers between each of the tests.

temperature of the block reaches T<INF>o</INF> (T<INF>o</INF> is 
234 deg. F above the initial block temperature, T<INF>I</INF>). If the 
oven thermostat operates by cycling on and off, make the following 
series of measurements: Measure the block temperature, T<INF>A</INF>, 
and the energy consumed, E<INF>A</INF>, at the end of the last ``ON'' 
period of the conventional oven before the block reaches T<INF>o</INF>. 
Measure the block temperature, T<INF>B</INF>, and the energy consumed, 
E<INF>B</INF>, at the beginning of the next ``ON'' period. Measure the 
block temperature, T<INF>C</INF>, and the energy consumed, 
E<INF>C</INF>, at the end of that ``ON'' period. Measure the block

E<INF>A</INF>, E<INF>B</INF>, E<INF>C</INF> and E<INF>D</INF> should be 
expressed in watt-hours for conventional electric ovens or standard 
cubic feet of gas for conventional gas ovens. For a gas oven measure in

specified in 3.1.2 and the total time, T<INF>T</INF>, in hours, that the 
unit is under test. Measure any electrical energy, E<INF>IC</INF>, 
consumed by an ignition device of a gas heating element in watt-hours.
    3.2.2.1  Gas consumption of continuously burning pilot lights. If 
the conventional gas cooking top under test has one or more continuously 
burning pilot lights, measure the gas consumed during the test by the 
pilot lights, P<INF>c</INF>, in standard cubic feet of gas, and the test 
duration, L<INF>c</INF>, in hours as specified in 3.1.2.1. If a gas flow 
meter is used, measure the flow rate, P, in standard cubic feet per 
hour.

Fahrenheit ( deg.F), of the water test load for the 2,000 ml, 1,000 ml, 
500 ml and 275 ml tests. The final temperature, T<INF>F</INF>, shall be 
measured after the test load has been stirred to insure uniform 
temperature distribution. Measure the elapsed time, t, in seconds, until 
the temperature rise of the water load is 45<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>9 deg. 
F.

    2.1  Testing required for air source cooling only units. Two steady 
state wet coil tests required to be performed, test A and test B. Test A 
is to be conducted as an outdoor dry bulb temperature of 95 deg. F and 
test B at 82 deg. F. Test C and D are optional tests to be conducted 
when cyclic performance parameters are to be measured in order to 
determine the degradation coefficient, C<SUP>D</SUP> Test C is a steady 
state dry coil test conducted at an outdoor dry bulb temperature of 
82 deg. F. Test D is a cyclic test also conducted at an outdoor dry bulb 
temperature of 82 deg. F. In lieu of conducting tests C and D, an 
assigned value of 0.25 may be used for the degradation coefficient, 
C<SUP>D</SUP>.
    2.1.1  Testing required for units with single speed compressors and 
single speed condenser fans. Test A and test B shall be performed 
according to the test procedures outlined in 4.1 of this Appendix. In 
addition, the cyclic performance shall be evaluated by conducting test C 
and D according to the requirements outlined in 4.1 of this Appendix.
    2.1.2  Testing required for units with single speed compressors and 
multiple-speed condenser fans. The test requirements for multiple-speed 
condenser fan units shall be the same as described in section 2.1.1 for 
single speed condensor fan units.
    2.1.3  Testing required for units with two-speed compressors, two 
compressors, or cylinder unloading. The test requirements for two-speed 
compressor units, two compressor units, or units with cylinder unloading 
are the same as described in 2.1.1 of this Appendix except that test A 
and test B shall be performed at each compressor speed or at each 
compressor capacity.
    2.1.4  Testing required for units with two-speed compressors, two 
compressors, or cylinder unloading capable of varying the sensible to 
total (S/T) capacity ratio. When a unit employing a two-speed 
compressor, two compressors, or cylinder unloading provides a method of 
varying the ratio of the sensible cooling capacity to the total cooling 
capacity, (S/T), the test requirements are the same as for two-speed 
compressor units as described in 2.1.3 of this Appendix.
    2.1.5  Testing required for units with triple-capacity compressors. 
(Reserved)
    2.1.6  Testing required for units with variable-speed compressors. 
The tests for variable-speed equipment consist of five (5) wet coil 
tests and two (2) dry coil tests. Two of the wet coil tests, A and B, 
are conducted at the maximum speed. Two wet coil tests, B<INF>2</INF> 
and low temperature test, are conducted at the minimum speed. The fifth 
wet coil test is conducted at an intermediate speed. Dry coil tests, C 
and D, are conducted at the minimum speed if the coefficient of 
degradation (C<INF>D</INF>) value of 0.25 is not adopted. The test 
conditions and procedures for the above are outlined in sections 3.1 and 
4.1 of this Appendix.

[[Page 174]]

    2.1.7  Testing required for split-type ductless systems. The tests 
for split-type ductless systems are determined by the type of compressor 
installed in the outdoor unit. For the appropriate tests refer to 
sections 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3, 2.1.4, 2.1.5, or 2.1.6 of this Appendix.
    2.2  Testing required for air source heating only units. Four types 
of tests are required to be performed: High Temperature, Cyclic, Frost 
Accumulation, and Low Temperature. In lieu of conducting the Cyclic Test 
an assigned value of 0.25 may be used for the degradation coefficient, 
C<SUP>D</SUP>.
    2.2.1  Testing required for units with single speed compressors. 
Units with single speed compressors shall be subjected respectively to 
the High Temperature Test at 47 deg. F described in section 3.2.1.1, the 
Cyclic Test as described in section 3.2.1.2, the Frost Accumulation Test 
as described in section 3.2.1.3, and the Low Temperature Test as 
described in section 3.2.1.4.
    2.2.2  Testing required for units with two-speed compressors, two 
compressors, or cylinder unloading. With the unit operating: at high 
compressors speed (two-speed compressor), with both compressors in 
operation (two-compressors), or at the maximum capacity (cylinder 
unloading); the following tests are required to be performed on all 
units; the High Temperature Test at 47 deg. F, the Frost Accumulation 
Test, and the Low Temperature Test. An additional test (cyclic at 
47 deg. F) is required, with the unit operating at the high compressor 
speed (two-speed compressor), with both compressors in operation (two 
compressors), or at the maximum capacity (cylinder unloading); if the 
normal mode of operation requires cycling ``on'' and ``off'' of the 
compressor(s) at high speed or maximum capacity.
    With the unit operating: at the low compressor speed (two-speed 
compressor), with the single compressor which normally operates at low 
loads (two compressors), or at the low compressor capacity (cylinder 
unloading); the following tests are required to be performed on all 
units: the High Temperature Test at 47 deg. F, the High Temperature Test 
at 62 deg. F, and the Cyclic Test. Additional tests, (Frost Accumulation 
Test and Low Temperature Test) are required, with the unit operating: on 
low compressor speed (two-speed compressor), with the single compressor 
which normally operates at low loads (two compressors) or at the low 
compressor capacity (cylinder unloading), if the unit's low speed, one 
compressor or low capacity performance at and below 40 deg. F is needed 
to calculate its seasonal performance.
    2.2.3  Testing required for units with triple-capacity compressors. 
(Reserved)
    2.2.4  Testing required for units with variable-speed compressors. 
There are seven basic tests and one optional test for variable-speed 
units. Three tests (high temperature test, low temperature test, and 
frost accumulation test) are performed at the maximum speed. Three tests 
(two high temperature and one cyclic test) are performed with the unit 
operating at minimum speed. A second frost accumulation test is 
performed at an intermediate speed. The intermediate speed is the same 
as in the cooling mode.
    In lieu of the maximum speed frost accumulation test, two equations 
are provided in section 4.2 of this Appendix. In lieu of the cyclic test 
an assigned value of 0.25 may be used for the coefficient of degradation 
C<INF>D</INF>. The optional test is a nominal capacity test applicable 
to units which have a heating mode maximum speed greater than the 
cooling mode maximum speed. The conditions and procedures for the above 
tests are described in sections 3.2 and 4.2 respectively, of this 
Appendix.
    2.2.5  Testing required for split-type ductless system. The type of 
compressor installed in the outdoor unit determines the testing 
required, refer to previous sections 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3, or 2.2.4. The 
conditions and procedures will be modified as indicated for the various 
types as stated in sections 3.2 and 4.2 respectively.
    2.3  Testing required for air source units which provide both 
heating and cooling. The requirements for units which provide both 
heating and cooling shall be the same as the requirements in Section 
2.1. and 2.2 of this Appendix.

                          3. testing conditions

    3.1  Testing conditions for air source cooling only units. The test 
room requirement and equipment installation procedures are the same as 
those specified in sections 11.1 and 11.2 of ASHRAE Standard 37-78. 
Units designed for both horizontal and vertical installation shall be 
tested in the orientation in which they are most frequently installed. 
All tests shall be performed at the normal residential voltage and 
frequency for which the equipment is designed (either 115 or 230 volts 
and 60 hertz), the test installation shall be designed such that there 
will be no air flow through the cooling coil due to natural or forced 
convection while the indoor fan is ``off''. This shall be accomplished 
by installing dampers upstream and downstream of the test unit to block 
the off period air flow. Values of capacity for rating purposes are to 
be rounded off to the nearest 100 Btu/hour for capacities less than 
20,000 Btu/hour; to the nearest 200 Btu/hour for capacities between 
20,000 and 37,999 Btu/hour; and to the nearest 500 Btu/hour for 
capacities between 38,000 and 64,999 Btu/hour.
    The following conditions listed in ARI Standard 210.79 shall apply 
to all tests performed in Section 3.1 of this Appendix:

5.1.3.4  Cooling Coil Air Quantity.
5.1.3.6  Requirements for Separated Assemblies.


[[Page 175]]


3.1.1  Testing conditions for units with single speed compressors and 
          single speed condenser fans.
    3.1.1.1  Steady state wet-coil performance tests (Test A and Test 
B). Test A and test B shall be performed with the air entering the 
indoor side of the unit having a dry-bulb temperature of 80 deg. F and a 
wet-bulb temperature of 87 deg. F. The dry-bulb temperature of the air 
entering the outdoor side of the unit shall be 95 deg. F in test A and 
82 deg. F in test B. The temperature of the air surrounding the outdoor 
side of the unit in each test shall be the same as the outdoor entering 
air temperature except for units or sections thereof intended to be 
installed only indoors, in which case the dry-bulb temperature 
surrounding that indoor side of the unit shall be 80 deg. F. For those 
units which reject condensate to the condenser, located in the outdoor 
side of the unit, the outdoor wet-bulb temperature surrounding the 
outdoor side of the unit shall be 75 deg. F in test A and 65 deg. F in 
test B.
    3.1.1.2  Steady state dry coil performance test (Test C) and cyclic 
dry coil performance test (Test D). Test C and test D shall be performed 
with the air entering the indoor side of the unit having a dry-bulb 
temperature of 80 deg. F and a wet-bulb temperature which does not 
result in formation of condensate on the indoor coil. (It is recommended 
that an indoor wet-bulb temperature of 57 deg. F or less be used.) The 
dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the outdoor portion of the unit 
shall be 82 deg. F. The outdoor portion of the unit shall be subject to 
the same conditions as the requirements for conducting test B as stated 
previously in section 3.1.1.1. Test C shall be conducted with the unit 
operating steadily. Test D shall be conducted by cycling the unit ``on'' 
and ``off'' by manual or automatic operation of the normal control 
circuit of the unit. The unit shall cycle with the compressor ``on'' for 
6 minutes and ``off'' for 24 minutes. The indoor fan shall also cycle 
``on'' and ``off'', the duration of the indoor fan ``on'' and ``off'' 
periods being governed by the automatic controls which the manufacturer 
normally supplies with the unit. The results of tests C and D shall be 
used to calculate a degradation coefficient, C<INF>D</INF> by the 
procedures outlined in 5.1 of this Appendix.
    3.1.2  Testing conditions for units with single speed compressors 
and multiple-speed condenser fans. The condenser fan speed to be used in 
test A shall be that speed which normally occurs at an outdoor dry-bulb 
temperature of 95 deg. F, and for test B, the fan speed shall be that 
which normally occurs at an outdoor dry-bulb temperature of 82 deg. F. 
If elected to be performed, tests C and D shall be conducted at the same 
condenser fan speed as in test B.
    3.1.3  Testing conditions for units with two-speed compressors, two 
compressors, or cylinder unloading. The condenser fan speed used in 
conducting test A at each compressor speed shall be that which normally 
occurs at an outdoor dry-bulb temperature of 95 deg. F. For test B, the 
condenser fan speed at each compressor speed shall be that which 
normally occurs at an outdoor dry-bulb temperature of 82 deg. F. If 
elected to be performed, tests C and D shall be conducted at the low 
compressor speed with the same condenser fan speed as used in test B. 
For those two-speed units in which the normal mode of operation involves 
cycling the compressor ``on'' and ``off'' at high speed, tests C and D 
shall also be performed with the compressor operating at high speed and 
at a condenser fan speed that normally occurs at test A ambient 
conditions. Units consisting of two compressors are subject to the same 
requirements as those units containing two-speed compressors, except 
that when operated at high speed, both compressors shall be operating 
and when operating at low speed, only the compressor which normally 
operates at an outdoor dry-bulb temperature of 82 deg. F shall be 
operating.
    In lieu of conducting tests C and D, an assigned value of 0.25 may 
be used for the degradation coefficient, C<INF>D</INF>, at each 
compressor speed. If the assigned degradation coefficient is used for 
one compressor speed it must also be used for the other compressor 
speed.
    In the case of units with cylinder unloading, the loaded and the 
unloaded conditions correspond to high and low compressor speed on two-
speed units respectively.
    3.1.4  Testing conditions for units with two-speed compressors, two 
compressors, or cylinder unloading capable of varying the sensible to 
total (S/T) capacity ratio. The mode of operation selected for 
controlling the S/T ratio in the performance of test A and test B at 
each compressor speed shall be such that it does not result in an 
operating configuration which is not typical of a normal residential 
installation. If elected to be performed, tests C and D shall be 
conducted at low compressor speed (single compressor operating) with the 
same S/T control mode as used in test B when performed at the low 
compressor speed. Likewise, tests C and D shall also be conducted at 
high compressor speed (two compressors operating) and with the same S/T 
control mode as in test A when performed at the high compressor speed.
    In the case of units with cylinder unloading, the loaded and 
unloaded conditions correspond to high and low compressor speed on two-
speed units respectively.
    3.1.5  Testing conditions for units with triple-capacity 
compressors. (Reserved)
    3.1.6  Additional testing conditions for cooling-only units with 
variable-speed compressors. For cooling-only units and air-source heat 
pumps with varaible-speed compressors, the air flow rate at fan speeds 
less than the maximum fan speed shall be determined by using the fan law 
for a fixed resistance system.

[[Page 176]]

The air flow rate is given by the ratio of the actual fan speed to the 
maximum fan speed multiplied by the air flow rate at the maximum fan 
speed. Minimum static pressure requirements only apply when the fan is 
running at the maximum speed.
    3.1.6.1  Testing conditions for steady-state wet coil tests. Tests A 
and B shall be performed at the maximum speed at conditions specified in 
section 3.1.1 of this Appendix. Test B<INF>2</INF> and the low 
temperature test are performed at the minimum speed with outdoor dry 
bulb temperatures of 82 deg.F and 67 deg.F respectively. The 
intermediate speed wet coil test is performed at the outdoor dry bulb 
temperature of 87 deg.F. For units which reject condensate the outdoor 
wet bulb temperature shall be maintained at 75 deg.F for Test A, 
65 deg.F for Tests B and B<INF>2</INF>, 53.5 deg.F for the low 
temperature test and 69 deg.F for the intermediate test. The indoor 
conditions for all wet coil tests are the same as those given in section 
3.1.1 of this Appendix.
    3.1.6.2  Test conditions for dry coil tests. Dry coil Tests C and D 
are conducted at an outdoor dry bulb temperature of 67 deg.F. For units 
which reject condensate the outdoor wet bulb temperature shall be 
maintained at 53.5 deg.F. The indoor dry bulb temperature shall be 
80 deg.F and the wet bulb temperature shall be sufficiently low so no 
condensation occurs on the evaporator (It is recommended that an indoor 
wet bulb temperature of 57 deg.F or less be used).
    3.1.7  Split-type ductless systems. Test conditions shall be the 
same as those specified for the same single outdoor unit compressor 
type, assuming it was matched with a single indoor coil.
    3.1.7.1  Interconnection. For split-type ductless systems, all 
standard rating tests shall be performed with a minimum length of 25 
feet of interconnecting tubing between each indoor fan-coil unit and the 
common outdoor unit. Such equipment in which the interconnection tubing 
is furnished as an integral part of the machine not recommended for 
cutting to length shall be tested with complete length of tubing 
furnished, or with 25 feet of tubing, whichever is greater. At least 10 
feet of the interconnection tubing shall be exposed to the outside 
conditions. The line sizes, insulation and details of installation shall 
be in accordance with the manufacturer's published recommendation.
    3.1.7.2  Control testing conditions for split-type ductless systems. 
For split-type ductless systems, a single control circuit shall be 
substituted for any multiple thermostats in order to maintain a uniform 
cycling rate during test D and the high temperature heating cyclic test. 
During the steady-state tests, all thermostats shall be shunted 
resulting in all indoor fan-coil units being in operation.
    3.1.7.3  Split-type ductless systems with multiple coils or multiple 
discharge outlets shall have short plenums attached to each outlet. Each 
plenum shall discharge into a single common duct section, the duct 
section in turn discharging into the air measuring device (or a suitable 
dampering device when direct air measurement is not employed). Each 
plenum shall have an adjustable restrictor located in the plane where 
the plenums enter the common duct section for the purpose of equalizing 
the static pressures in each plenum. The length of the plenum is a 
minimum of 2.5 x (A x B)<SUP>.5</SUP>, A=width and B=height of duct or 
outlet. Static pressure readings are taken at a distance of 
2 x (A x B)<SUP>.5</SUP> from the outlet.
    3.2  Testing conditions for air source heating only units. The 
equipment under test shall be installed according to the requirements of 
Section 11.2 of ASHRAE Standard 37-78 and Section 5.1.4.5 of ARI 
Standard 240-77. Test chamber requirements are the same as given in 
Section 11.1 of ASHRAE Standard 37-78. Units designed for both 
horizontal and vertical installation shall be tested in the orientation 
in which they are most often installed. All tests shall be performed at 
the normal residential voltage and frequency for which the equipment is 
designed (either 115 or 230 volts and 60 hertz). Values of capacity for 
rating purposes are to be rounded off to the nearest 100 Btu/hour for 
capacities less than 20,000 Btu/hour; to the nearest 200 Btu/hour for 
capacities between 20,000 and 37,999 Btu/hour; and to the nearest 500 
Btu/hour for capacities between 38,000 and 64,999 Btu/hour.
    3.2.1  Testing conditions for units with single speed compressors.
    3.2.1.1  High temperature test conditions. The High Temperature Test 
at 47 deg. F shall be conducted at an outdoor dry-bulb temperature of 
47 deg. F and an outdoor wet-bulb temperature at 43 deg. F. The High 
Temperature Test at 62 deg. F shall be conducted at an outdoor dry-bulb 
temperature of 62 deg. F and an outdoor wet-bulb temperature of 
56.5 deg. F. For both tests, the dry-bulb air temperature entering and 
surrounding the indoor portion of the unit shall be 70 deg. F and a 
maximum wet-bulb temperature of 60 deg. F. The duration of the tests 
shall be for a minimum of \1/2\ hour.
    3.2.1.2  Cycling test conditions. The Cycling Test at 47 deg. F 
shall be conducted at the same dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperature as the 
High Temperature Test at 47 deg. F as described in 3.2.1.1. During the 
Cycling Test, the indoor fan shall cycle ``on'' and ``off'', as the 
compressor cycles ``on'' and ``off'', except that the indoor fan cycling 
times may be delayed due to controls that are normally installed with 
the unit. The compressor cycling times shall be 6 minutes ``On'' and 24 
minutes ``off.'' The test installation shall be designed such that there 
will be no airflow through the indoor unit due to natural or forced 
convection while the indoor fan is ``off.'' This shall be accomplished 
by installing dampers

[[Page 177]]

upstream and downstream of the test unit to block the off period 
airflow.
    3.2.1.3  Frost accumulation test conditions. The dry-bulb 
temperature and the resultant dew-point temperature of the air entering 
the outdoor portion of the unit shall be 35 deg. F and 30 deg. F 
respectively. The indoor dry-bulb temperature shall be 70 deg. F and the 
maximum indoor wet-bulb temperature shall be 60 deg. F. The Frost 
Accumulation Test requires that the unit undergo a defrost prior to the 
actual test. The test then begins at defrost termination and ends at the 
next defrost termination. Defrost termination occurs when the controls 
normally installed within the unit are actuated to cause it to change 
defrost operation to normal heating operation. During the test, 
auxiliary resistance heaters shall not be employed during either the 
heating or defrost portion of the test.
    3.2.1.4  Low temperature test conditions. The Low Temperature Test 
shall be conducted at a dry-bulb temperature entering the outdoor 
portion of the unit of 17 deg. F and a wet-bulb temperature of 15 deg. 
F. The air entering the indoor portion of the unit shall have a dry-bulb 
temperature of 70 deg. F and a maximum wet-bulb temperature of 60 deg. 
F.
    3.2.1.5  Additional testing conditions. All tests shall be conducted 
at the indoor-side air quantities specified in Sections 4.1.4.3 and 
5.1.4.6 and Table 2 of ARI Standard 240-77. The following conditions 
listed in ARI Standard 240-77 shall apply to all tests performed in 
Section 3.2 of this Appendix.

    3.2.3  Testing conditions for units with triple-capacity 
compressors. (Reserved)
    3.2.4  Testing conditions for units with variable-speed compressors. 
The testing condition for variable-speed compressors shall be the same 
as those for single speed units as described in section 3.2.1 of this 
Appendix with the following exceptions; the cyclic test is performed 
with an outdoor dry bulb temperature of 62 deg.F and a wet bulb 
temperature of 56.5 deg.F. The optional, nominal capacity test shall be 
performed at the conditions specified for the 47 deg.F high temperature 
test.
    3.2.5  Testing conditions for split-type ductless system. The 
testing conditions for split-type ductless systems shall be based on the 
type of compressor installed in the single outdoor unit. The heating 
mode shall have the same piping and control requirements as in 3.1.7.
5.4.4.4  Outdoor-Side Air Quantity; and
5.1.4.5  Requirements for Separated Assemblies.

In all tests, the specified dry-bulb temperature entering the outdoor 
portion of the unit also applies to the air temperature surrounding the 
outdoor portion of the unit. Similarly, models where portions are 
intended to be installed indoors shall have the air temperature 
surrounding that portion of the unit the same as the indoor air 
temperature.
    3.2.2  Testing conditions for units with two-speed compressors, two 
compressors or cylinder unloading. The testing conditions for two-speed 
compressors, two compressors, or cylinder unloading shall be the same as 
those for single speed units as described in 3.2.1.
    3.3  Testing conditions for air source units which provide both 
heating and cooling. The testing conditions for units which provide both 
heating and cooling shall be the same as the requirements in Sections 
3.1 and 3.2 of this Appendix.
    4.0  Testing procedures. Measure all electrical inputs as described 
in the procedures below. All electrical measurements during all ``on'' 
and ``off'' periods shall include auxiliary power or energy (controls, 
transformers, crankcase heaters, etc.) delivered to the unit.
    4.1  Test procedures for air source cooling-only units. All steady-
state wet- and dry-coil performance tests on single package units shall 
simultaneously employ the Air-Enthalpy Method (Section 3 of ASHRAE 
Standard 37-78) on the indoor side and one other method consisting of 
either the Air-Enthalpy Method or the Compressor Calibration Method 
(Section 4 of ASHRAE Standard 37-78 on the outdoor side. All steady-
state wet- and dry-coil performance tests on split systems shall 
simultaneously employ the Air-Enthalpy Method or the Compressor 
Calibration Method on the indoor side and the Air-Enthalpy Method, the 
Compressor Calibration Method or the Volatile Refrigerant Flow Method 
(Section 5 of ASHRAE Standard 37-78) on the outside. All cyclic dry-coil 
performance tests shall employ the Air-Enthalpy Method, indoor side 
only. The values calculated from the two test methods must agree within 
6 percent in order to constitute a valid test. Only the results from the 
Air-Enthalpy Method on the indoor side shall be used in the calculations 
in Section 5.1. Units shall be installed and tested in such a manner 
that when operated under steady-state conditions, the cooling coil and 
condenser coil air flows meet the requirements of Sections 5.1.3.4, 
5.1.3.5, and 5.1.3.7 of ARI Standard 210.79.
    4.1.1  Test operating procedures.
    4.1.1.1  Steady-state wet-coil performance tests (Test A and Test 
B). Steady-state wet-coil performance tests (A and B) shall be conducted 
in accordance with the conditions described in sections 3.1.1.1, 3.1.2, 
3.1.3, 3.1.4, and 3.1.5 of this Appendix and the procedures described 
for cooling tests in Section 11.3 of ASHRAE standard 37-78 and evaluated 
in accordance with the cooling-related requirements of Section 12 of the 
ASHRAE Standard 37-78. The test room reconditioning apparatus and the 
equipment under test shall be operated until equilibrium conditions are 
attained.
    4.1.1.2  Steady-state and cyclic dry-coil performance tests (Test C 
and Test D). The steady-

[[Page 178]]

state and cyclic dry-coil tests (C and D) shall be conducted as 
described below in accordance with the conditions described in sections 
3.1.1.2, 3.1.2, 3.1.3, 3.1.4, and 3.1.5 of this Appendix. The results 
shall be evaluated in accordance with the cooling related requirements 
of Sections 12.1.5, 12.1.6, 12.1.7, of ASHRAE Standard 37.78. The test 
room reconditioning apparatus and the equipment under test shall be 
operated until equilibrium conditions are attained, but not for less 
than one hour before data for test C are recorded. For all equipment 
test methods including the Compressor Calibration Method, test C shall 
be performed with data recorded at 10-minute intervals until four 
consecutive sets of readings are attained with the tolerance prescribed 
in Section 11.6 of ASHRAE Standard 37-78. When the Air-Enthalpy Method 
is used on the outdoor side for test C, the requirements of this section 
shall apply to both the preliminary test and the regular equipment test; 
the requirements of Section 3.6 of ASHRAE Standard 37-78 shall also 
apply. Immediately after test C is completed the test unit shall be 
manually cycled ``off'' and ``on'' using the time periods from 3.1.1 of 
this Appendix until steadily repeating ambient conditions are again 
achieved in both the indoor and outdoor test chambers, but for not less 
than 2 complete ``off''/``on'' cycles. Without a break in the cycling 
pattern, the unit shall be run through an additional ``off''/``on'' 
cycle during which the test data required in 5.1 shall be recorded. 
During this last cycle, which is referred to as the test cycle, the 
indoor and outdoor test room ambient conditions shall remain within the 
tolerances specified in 4.1.3 of this Appendix during the cyclic dry-
coil tests, all air moving equipment on the condenser side shall cycle 
``on'' and ``off'' when the compressor cycles ``on'' and ``off''. The 
indoor air moving equipment shall also cycle ``off'' as governed by any 
automatic controls normally installed with the unit. This last 
requirement applies to units having an indoor fan time delay. Units not 
supplied with an indoor fan time delay shall have the indoor air moving 
equipment cycle ``on'' and ``off'' as the compressor cycles ``on'' and 
``off.''
    Cooling cyclic tests for variable-speed units shall be conducted by 
cycling the compressor 12 minutes ``on'' and 48 minutes ``off''. The 
capacity shall be measured for the integration time (<greek-th>), which 
is the compressor ``on'' time of 12 minutes or the ``on'' time as 
extended by fan delay, if so equipped. The electrical energy shall be 
measured for the total integration time (<greek-th><INF>cyc</INF>) of 60 
minutes. In lieu of conducting C and D tests, an assigned value of 0.25 
shall be used for the degradation coefficient for cooling, 
C<INF>D</INF>.
    4.1.1.3  Testing procedures for triple-capacity compressors. 
(Reserved)
    4.1.1.4  Intermediate cooling steady-state test for units with 
variable-speed compressors. For units with variable-speed compressors, 
an intermediate cooling steady-state test shall be conducted in which 
the unit shall be operated at a constant, intermediate compressor speed 
(k=i) in which the dry/bulb and wet-bulb temperatures of the air 
entering the indoor coil are 80 deg.F<INF>DB</INF> and 
67 deg.F<INF>WB</INF> and the outdoor coil are 87 deg.<INF>DB</INF> and 
69 deg.F<INF>WB</INF>. The tolerances for the dry-bulb and wet-bulb 
temperatures of the air entering the indoor and outdoor coils shall be 
the test operating tolerance and test condition tolerance specified in 
Table 6.1.1 of this Appendix. The intermediate compressor speed shall be 
the minimum compressor speed plus one-third the difference between the 
maximum and minimum speeds of the cooling mode. (Inter. speed=min. 
speed+\1/3\ (max. speed-min. speed.) A tolerance of plus five percent or 
the next higher inverter frequency step from that calculated is allowed.
    4.1.1.5  Testing procedures for split-type ductless systems. Cyclic 
tests of ductless units will be conducted without dampers. The data 
cycle shall be preceded by a minimum of two cycles in which the indoor 
fan cycles on and off with the compressor. For the data cycle the indoor 
fan will operate three minutes prior to compressor cut-on and remain on 
for three minutes after compressor cut-off. The integration time for 
capacity and power shall be from compressor cut-on time to indoor fan 
cut-off time. The fan power for three minutes after compressor cut-off 
shall be added to the integrated cooling capacity.
    4.1.2  Test instrumentation. The steady-state and cyclic performance 
tests shall have the same requirements pertaining to instrumentation and 
data as those specified in Section 10 and Table II of ASHRAE Standard 
37.78. For the cyclic dry-coil performance tests, the dry-bulb 
temperature of the air entering and leaving the cooling coil, or the 
difference between these two dry-bulb temperatures, shall be 
continuously recorded with instrumentation accurate to within 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.3 deg. F of indicated value and have a response 
time of 2.5 seconds or less. Response time in the time required for the 
instrumentation to obtain 63 percent of the final steady-state 
temperature difference when subjected to a step change in temperature 
difference of 15 deg. F or more. Electrical measurement devices (watt-
hour meters) used during all tests shall be accurate to within 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.5 percent of indicated value.
    4.1.3  Test tolerances. All steady-state wet-and dry-coil 
performance tests shall be performed within the applicable operating and 
test condition tolerances specified in Section 11.6 and Table III of 
ASHRAE Standard 37-78.
    4.1.3.1  The indoor and outdoor average dry-bulb temperature for the 
cyclic dry coil test D shall both be within 1.0 deg. F of the indoor and 
outdoor average dry bulb temperature for the steady-state dry coil test 
C, respectively.

[[Page 179]]

    4.1.3.2  The test condition and test operating tolerances for 
conducting test D are stated in 6.1.1 of this Appendix. Variation in the 
test conditions greater than the tolerances prescribed in 6.1.1 of this 
Appendix shall invalidate the test. It is suggested that an electric 
resistance heater having a heating capacity approximately equal to the 
sum of the cooling capacity and compressor and condenser fan power 
should be installed in the outdoor test room and cycled ``off'' and 
``on'' as the unit cycles ``on'' and ``off'' respectively to improve 
control in the outdoor test room. Similarly, an electric resistance 
heater having a heating capacity approximately equal to the cooling 
capacity of the unit could be installed in the indoor test room, and 
cycled ``on'' and ``off'' as the test unit cycles ``on'' and ``off'' to 
improve indoor room control.
    4.2  Testing procedures for air source heating only units.
    4.2.1  Test operating procedures. All High Temperature Tests, the 
Cyclic Test, the Frost Accumulation Test, and the low Temperature test 
shall have the performance evaluated by the Air-Enthalpy Method on the 
indoor side. In addition, the High Temperature Test and the Low 
Temperature Test shall have a simultaneous test method (as described in 
4.1) used as a check. The values calculated from the two methods must 
agree within 6 percent in order to constitute a valid test. Only the 
results from the Air-Enthalpy Method on the indoor side shall be used in 
the calulations in section 5.2.
    4.2.1.1  Test procedure for high temperature test. When the outdoor 
Air-Enthalpy Method is used, the outdoor chamber must not interfere with 
the normal air circulating pattern during the preliminary test. It is 
necessary to determine and adjust for system resistance when the outdoor 
air measuring apparatus is attached to the outdoor portion of the unit. 
The test room apparatus and test units must be operated for at least one 
hour with at least \1/2\ hour at equilibrium and at the specified test 
conditions prior to starting the test. The High Temperature Test shall 
then be conducted for a minimum of \1/2\ hour with intermittent data 
being recorded at 10-minute intervals. For all units, especially those 
having controls which periodically cause the unit to operate in defrost 
mode, attention should be given to prevent defrost during the High 
Temperature Test. Units which have undergone a defrost should operate in 
the heating mode for at least 10-minutes after defrost termination prior 
to the start of the test. When the outdoor Air-Enthalpy Method is used 
as a second test then a preliminary test must be conducted for a minimum 
of 30 minutes with 4 or more sets of data recorded at 10 minute 
intervals, all remaining requirements of Section 3.6.1 in the ASHRAE 
Standard 37-78 shall then apply in conducting the preliminary test for 
the outdoor air enthalpy method. For some units, at the ambient 
condition of the test, frost may accumulate on the outdoor coil. If the 
supply air temperature or the difference between the supply air 
temperature and the indoor air entering temperature has decreased by 
more than 1.5 deg. F at the end of the test, the unit shall be defrosted 
and the test restarted. Only the results of this second High Temperature 
Test shall be used in the heating seasonal performance calculation in 
section 5.2. Prior to beginning the High Temperature Test, a unit shall 
operate in the heating mode for at least 10 minutes after defrost 
termination to establish equilibrium conditions for the unit and the 
room reconditioning apparatus. The High Temperature Test may only begin 
when the test unit and room conditions are within the test condition 
tolerances specified in Section 6.2.1 of this Appendix.
    4.2.1.2  Test procedures for the cyclic test. The cyclic test shall 
follow the High Temperature Test and by cycled ``on'' and ``off'' as 
specified in 3.2.1.2 until steadily repeating ambient conditions are 
achieved for both the indoor and outdoor test chambers, but for not less 
than 2 complete ``off''/``on'' cycles. Without a break in the cycling 
pattern, the unit shall be operated through an additional ``off''/``on'' 
cycle, during which the required test data shall be recorded. During the 
last cycle, which is referred to as the test cycle, the indoor and 
outdoor test room ambient conditions shall remain within the tolerance 
specified in section 6.2.2. of this Appendix. If, prior to the High 
Temperature Test, the unit underwent a defrost cycle to rid the outdoor 
coil of any accumulated frost, then prior to cycling the unit ``off'' 
and ``on'' it should be made to undergo a defrost. After defrost is 
completed and before starting the cycling process, the unit shall be 
operated continuously in the heating mode for a least 10 minutes to 
assure that equilibrium conditions have again been established for the 
unit and the room conditioning apparatus. Cycling the unit may begin 
when the test unit and room conditions are within the High Temperature 
Test condition tolerances specified in section 6.2.1 of this Appendix. 
Attention should be given to prevent defrost after the cycling process 
has begun.
    The cycle times for variable-speed units is the same as the cyclic 
time in the cooling mode as specified in section 4.1.1.2 of this 
Appendix. Cyclic tests of split-type ductless units will be conducted 
without dampers, and the data cycle shall be preceded by a minimum of 
two cycles in which the indoor fan cycles on and off with the 
compressor. During the data cycle for the split type ductless units, the 
indoor fan will operate three minutes prior to compressor ``cut-on'' and 
remain on for three minutes after compressor ``cut-off''. The 
integration time for capacity and power will be from compressor

[[Page 180]]

``cut-on'' time to indoor fan ``cut-off'' time. The fan power for the 
three minutes after compressor ``cut-off'' shall be subtracted from the 
integrated heating capacity. For split-type ductless systems which turn 
the indoor fan off during defrost, the indoor supply duct shall not be 
blocked.
    4.2.1.3  Test procedures for the frost accumulation test. The 
defrost controls shall be set at the normal settings which most typify 
those encountered in Region IV as described in section 6.2.4 and 6.2.5 
of this Appendix. The test room reconditioning equipment and the unit 
under test shall be operated for at least \1/2\ hour prior to the start 
of a ``preliminary'' test period. The preliminary test period and the 
test period itself are to be conducted within the test tolerances given 
in section 4.2.3.3 of this Appendix. In some cases, the preliminary 
defrost cycle may be manually induced, however, it is important that the 
normally operating controls govern the defrost termination in all cases. 
For units containing defrost controls which are likely to cause defrost 
at intervals less than one hour when the unit is operating at the 
required test conditions, the preliminary test period shall start at the 
termination of a defrost cycle which automatically occurs and shall end 
at the termination of the next automatically occurring defrost cycle. 
For units containing defrost controls which are likely to cause defrost 
at intervals exceeding one hour when operating at the required test 
condition, the preliminary test period consists of ``heating-only'' 
preliminary operation for at least one hour, after which a defrost may 
be manually or automatically induced. The test period then begins at the 
termination of this defrost cycle and ends at the termination of the 
next automatically occurring defrost cycle. If the unit has not 
undergone a defrost after 12 hours, then the tests shall be concluded 
and the results calculated for this 12-hour period. For units which turn 
the indoor fan off during defrost the indoor supply duct shall be 
blocked during all defrost cycles to prevent natural or forced 
convection through the indoor unit. During defrost, resistance heaters 
normally installed with the unit shall be prevented from operating.
    For units with variable-speed compressors, the frost accumulation 
test at the intermediate speed shall be conducted such that the unit 
will operate at a constant, intermediate compressor speed (k=i) as 
determined in section 4.1.1.4 of this Appendix. The following two 
equations may be used in lieu of the frost accumulation test for 
variable-speed.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.039

    4.2.1.4  Test procedures for the low temperature test. Where 
applicable, the High Temperature Test preparation and performance 
requirements shall also be used in the Low Temperature Test. The test 
room reconditioning equipment shall first be operated in a steady-state 
manner for at least one-half hour at equilibrium and at the specified 
test conditions. The unit shall then undergo a defrost, either automatic 
or manually induced. It is important that the unit terminate the defrost 
sequence by the action of its own defrost controls. The defrost controls 
are to remain at the same setting as specified in 4.2.1.3. At a time no 
earlier than 10 minutes after defrost termination, the test shall start. 
Test duration is one-half hour. For all units, defrost should be 
prevented during the one-half hour test period.
    4.2.2  Test instrumentation.
    4.2.2.1  Test instrumentation for the high temperature test. The 
indoor air flow rate shall be determined as described in Section 7.1 
through 7.4 of ASHRAE Standard 37-78. This requires the construction of 
an air receiving chamber and discharge chamber separated by partition in 
which one or more nozzles are located. The receiving chamber is 
connected to the indoor air discharge side of the test specimen through 
a short plenum. The exhaust side of the air flow rate measuring device 
contains an exhaust fan with some means to vary its capacity to obtain 
the desired external resistance to air flow rate. The exhaust side is 
then left open to the test room or is ducted through a conditioning 
apparatus and then back to the test specimen inlet. The static pressure 
across the nozzles, the velocity pressure, and the static pressure 
measurements at the nozzle throat shall be measured with manometers 
which will result in errors which are no greater than 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1.0 percent of indicated value and having minimum 
scale divisions not exceeding 2.0 percent of the reading. Static 
pressure and temperature measurements must be taken at the nozzle throat 
in order to obtain density of the air. The areas of the nozzles shall be 
determined

[[Page 181]]

by measuring their diameter with an error no greater than 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.2 percent in four places approximately 45 degrees 
apart around the nozzle in each of two places through the nozzle throat, 
one at the outlets and the others in the straight section near the 
radius. The energy usage of the compressor, indoor and outdoor fan, and 
all other equipment components shall be measured with a watt-hour meter 
which is accurate to within <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.5 percent of the 
quantity measured. Measurements of the air temperature entering and 
leaving the indoor coil or the difference between these two shall be 
made in accordance with the requirements of ASHRAE Standard 41 part 1. 
These temperatures shall be continuously recorded with instrumentation 
having a total system accuracy within <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.3 deg. F of 
indicated value and a response time of 2.5 seconds or less. Temperature 
measurements are to be made upstream of the static pressure tap on the 
inlet and downstream of the static pressure taps on the outlet. The 
indoor and outdoor dry-bulb temperatures shall be continuously recorded 
with instrumentation which will result in an error no greater than 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.3 deg. F of indicated value. The outdoor wet-bulb 
temperature shall be continuously recorded. Static pressure measurements 
in the ducts and across the unit shall be made in accordance with 
Section 8 of ASHRAE Standard 37-78 using equipment which will result in 
an error no greater than <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.01 inch of water. Static 
pressure measurements shall be made and recorded at 5 minute intervals. 
All other data not continuously recorded shall be recorded at 10 minute 
intervals.
    4.2.2.2  Test instrumentation for the cycling test. The air flow 
rate during the on-period of the Cyclic Test shall be the same agreed 
within <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1. percent as the air flow rate measured 
during the previously conducted High Temperature Test. All other 
instrumentation requirements are identical to 4.2.2.1 of this Appendix.
    4.2.2.3  Test instrumentation for the frost accumulation test. The 
air flow rate for the Frost Accumulation Test shall be the same as 
described in 4.2.2.1. The indoor-side dry-bulb temperature and outdoor-
side dry-bulb temperature shall be continuously recorded with 
instrumentation having a total system accuracy within 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.3 deg. F of indicated value. The outdoor dew 
point temperature shall be determined with an error no greater than 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.5 deg. F of indicated value using continuously 
recording instrumentation. All other data shall be recorded at 10 minute 
intervals during the heating cycle. Defrost initiation, termination and 
complete test cycle time (from defrost termination to defrost 
termination) shall be recorded. Defrost initiation is defined as the 
actuation (either automatically or manually) of the controls normally 
installed with the unit which cause it to alter its normal heating 
operation in order to eliminate possible accumulations of frost on the 
outdoor coil. Defrost termination occurs when the controls normally 
within the unit are actuated to change from defrost operation to normal 
heating operation. Provisions should be made so that instrumentation in 
capable of recording the cooling done during defrost as well as the 
total electrical energy usage during defrost. These data and the 
continuously recorded data need be the only data obtained during 
defrost.
    4.2.2.4  Test instrumentation for the low temperature test. 
Instrumentation for the Low Temperature Test is identical to that of the 
High Temperature Test described in section 4.2.2.1 of this Appendix.
    4.2.3  Test tolerances.
    4.2.3.1  Test tolerances for the high temperature test. All tests 
shall be conducted within the tolerances specified in Section 6.2.1. 
Variation greater than those given shall invalidate the test. The 
heating capacity results by the indoor Air Enthalpy Method shall agree 
within 6 percent of the value determined by any other simultaneously 
conducted capacity test in order for the test to be valid.
    4.2.3.2  Test tolerances for the cyclic test. The test condition 
tolerances and test operating tolerances for the on-period portion of 
the test cycle are specified in Section 6.2.2. Variation exceeding any 
specified test tolerance shall invalidate the test results.
    4.2.3.3  Test tolerances for the frost accumulation test. Test 
condition and test operating tolerances for Frost Accumulation Tests are 
specified in Section 6.2.3. Test operating tolerances during heating 
applies when the unit is in the heating mode, except for the first 5 
minutes after the termination of a defrost cycle. Test operating 
tolerance during defrost applies during a defrost cycle and during the 
first 5 minutes after defrost termination when the unit is operating in 
the heating mode. In determining whether the test condition tolerances 
are met, only the heating portion of the test period shall be used in 
calculating the average values. Variations exceeding the tolerances 
presented in Section 6.2.3 shall invalidate the test.
    4.2.3.4  Test tolerances for the low temperature test. During the 
test period for the Low Temperature Test, the operating conditions shall 
be within the tolerances specified in Section 6.2.1 of this Appendix.
    4.3  Testing procedures for air source units which provide both 
heating and cooling. The testing procedures for units which provide both 
heating and cooling shall be the same as those specified in Sections 4.1 
and 4.2 of this Appendix. Also during the off-period of the dry-coil 
cooling test (test D), the switch-over valve shall remain in the cooling 
mode, unless the controls normally supplied with the unit are designed 
to reverse it, in which case the controls shall operate the valve. 
During the off-period of the cyclic heating

[[Page 182]]

test at 47 deg. F, the switch-over valve shall remain in the heating 
mode, unless the controls normally supplied with the unit are designed 
to reverse it, in which case the controls shall operate the valve.
    5.0  Calculations for performance factors.
    5.1  Calculations of seasonal energy efficiency ratios (SEER) in 
air-source units.
    The testing data and results required to calculate the seasonal 
energy efficiency ratio (SEER) in Btu's per watt-hour shall include the

    Where the cooling capacities Q<INF>ss</INF><SUP>k</SUP>  (95F), from 
test A, Q<INF>ss</INF><SUP>k</SUP>  (82), from test B, and 
Q<INF>ss</INF>, dry, from test C, are calculated using the equations 
specified in section 3.7 of ASHRAE Standard 37-78. The total cooling 
done, Q<INF>cyc</INF>, dry from test D, is calculated using equation (1) 
below.
    Units which do not have indoor air circulating fans furnished as 
part of the model shall have their measured total cooling capacities 
adjusted by subtracting 1250 Btu/hr per 1,000 CFM of measured indoor air 
flow and adding to the total steady-state electrical power input 365 
watts per 1,000 CFM of measured indoor air flow.
    Energy efficiency ratios from tests A, B, and C, EER<INF>A</INF>, 
EER<INF>B</INF>, EER<INF>ss</INF>, dry respectively, are each calculated 
as the ratio of the total cooling capacity in Btu/hr to the total 
electrical power input in watts.
    Units which do not have indoor air circulating fans furnished as 
part of the model shall adjust their total cooling done and energy used 
in one complete cycle for the effect of circulating indoor air equipment 
power. The value to be used for the circulating indoor air equipment 
power shall be 1250 Btu/hr per 1,000 CFM of circulating indoor air. The 
energy usage required in one complete cycle required for indoor air 
circulation is the product of the circulating indoor air equipment power 
and the duration of time in one cycle that the circulating indoor air 
equipment is on. The total cooling done shall then be the measured 
cooling in one complete cycle minus the energy usage required for indoor 
air circulation in one complete cycle. The total electrical energy usage 
shall be the sum of the energy usage required for indoor air circulation 
in one complete cycle and the energy used by the remaining equipment 
components (compressor(s), outdoor fan, crankcase heater, 
transformer(s), etc.) in one complete test cycle.
    Energy efficiency ratio from tests D, EER<INF>cyc</INF> dry is 
calculated as the ratio of the total cooling done in Btu's to the total 
electrical energy usage in watt-hours.

 Appendix N to Subpart B of Part 430--Uniform Test Method for Measuring 
                   the Energy Consumption of Furnaces

    1. Definitions. Definitions shall include the definitions specified 
in section 3.0 of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82 and the following additional 
definitions:
    1.1  ASHRAE means the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and 
Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc.
    1.2  ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82 means the test standard published in 1982 by 
ASHRAE, approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) on 
June 21, 1983 and titled ``Methods of Testing for Heating Seasonal 
Efficiency of Central Furnaces And Boilers.''
    1.3  Electro-mechanical stack damper means a type of stack damper 
which is operated by electrical and/or mechanical means.
    1.4  Isolated combustion system means an installation in which a 
furnace is installed indoors and all combustion and ventilation air is 
admitted through grills or ducts from outdoors and (all such air) does 
not communicate with air in the conditioned space.
    1.5  Modulating control means either a step modulating or a ``two-
stage control''
    1.6  Reduced heat input rate means the factory adjusted lowest 
reduced heat input rate for furnaces equipped with either two stage 
thermostats or step-modulating thermostats.
    1.7  Single stage thermostat means a thermostat that cycles a burner 
from the maximum heat input rate and off.
    1.8  Step-modulating control means a modulating control that cycles 
a burner from the reduced input rate to off if the heating load is 
light. If a higher heating load is encountered which cannot be met with 
the reduced input rate, the control either gradually increases or steps 
up the input rate to meet the higher heating load. At that point if a 
lower heating load is encountered, the control either gradually 
decreases or steps down to a lower rate, or gradually increases the heat 
input to meet any higher heating load that cannot be met with the low 
firing rate.
    1.9  Thermal stack damper means a type of stack damper which is 
dependent for operation exclusively upon the direct conversion of 
thermal energy of the stack gases into closure of the damper.
    1.10  Two stage control means a modulating control that cycles a 
burner from reduced heat input rate and off or cycles a burner at the 
maximum heat input rate and off.
    2.0  Testing conditions. The testing conditions shall be as 
specified in section 8 of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82 with the exception of 
section 8.4.2.3, and the inclusion of the following additional testing 
conditions:
    2.1  Gas burner adjustment at maximum input rate. The following 
paragraph is in addition to the requirements specified in section 
8.4.1.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82:
    For gas fueled furnaces and boilers equipped with modulating type 
controls, adjust the controls to operate the unit at the maximum fuel 
input rate. Set the thermostat control to the maximum setting. Start the 
furnace or boiler by turning the safety control valve to the ``on'' 
position. Use a supply water temperature for boilers that will allow for 
continuous operation without shut off by the thermostat control.
    2.2  Gas burner adjustment at reduced input rate. The following 
paragraph is in addition to the requirements specified in section 
8.4.1.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82:
    For gas fueled furnaces and boilers equipped with modulating type 
thermostat controls, adjust the controls to operate the unit at the 
reduced fuel input rate. Set the thermostat control to the lowest 
setting that does not cause the burner to cycle on and off. Start the 
furnace or boiler by turning the safety control valve to the ``on'' 
position. Use supply water temperature for boilers that will allow for 
continuous operation without shut off by the thermostat control. If 
necessary, supply water may be increased above 120 deg. F in order to 
maintain continuous operation at the reduced setting.
    2.3  Gas and oil fueled low pressure steam and hot water boilers 
(including direct vent systems). The following paragraphs are in place 
of section 8.4.2.3 of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82:
    For non-condensing hot water boilers, the water flow rate shall be 
adjusted to produce a water temperature rise, during the steady-state 
test described in section 9.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82, of 19 deg. F -
24 deg. F. During the steady-state and heat-up tests, the hot water 
boiler shall be supplied with water having a temperature of at least 
120 deg. F but not more than 124 deg. F.

[[Page 202]]

    For steam boilers, the pressure shall be at atmospheric or at a 
pressure not exceeding 2 psig during the steady-state test.
    3.0  Test procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified 
in section 9 of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82 with the exception of sections 9.2.2 
and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures:
    3.1  Gas fueled gravity furnaces, forced air central furnaces, and 
low pressure steam and hot water boilers (including direct vent systems, 
excluding condensing furnaces or boilers). The following paragraphs are 
in addition to the requirements specified in section 9.1.1 of ANSI/
ASHRAE 103-82:
    For all gas fueled furnaces and boilers, the steady-state efficiency 
shall be determined at the maximum fuel input rate measured in 
accordance with sections 2.1 of this appendix and section 9.1.1 of ANSI/
ASHRAE 103-82. Also, for gas fueled furnaces and boilers equipped with 
either two stage thermostats or step-modulating thermostats, the steady-
state efficiency shall also be determined at the reduced fuel input rate 
measured in accordance with sections 2.2 of this appendix and section 
9.1.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82.
    In addition, for gas fueled furnances and boilers equipped with 
draft hoods, measure CO<INF>2</INF> in stack after dilution during the 
steady state condition.
    3.2  Flue temperature measurements--cool down test. The following 
paragraphs are in addition to the requirements specified in section 9.2 
of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82:
    For furnaces and boilers equipped with step-modulating thermostats, 
the cool down
test shall be conducted after steady-state conditions have been reached 
at the reduced input rate, as specified in section 2.2 of this appendix. 
For furnaces and boilers equipped with two stage controls, separate cool 
down tests shall be conducted after steady-state conditions have been 
reached at both the reduced and maximum fuel input rates.
    3.3  Gas and oil fueled boilers--cool down test. The following 
paragraphs are in place of the requirements specified in section 9.2.2 
of ASHRAE 103-82:
    After steady-state testing has been completed, turn the main 
burner(s) off and measure the flue gas temperature at 3.75 
(T<INF>F,OFF(t3)</INF>) and 22.5 (T<INF>F,OFF(t4)</INF>) minutes after 
the burner shuts off, using the thermocouple grid described above. 
During this off period for units that do not have pump delay after shut-
off, no water shall be allowed to circulate through the hot water 
boilers. For units that have pump delay on shut-off, except those having 
pump controls sensing water temperature, the pump shall be stopped by 
the unit control and the time, t<SUP>+</SUP>, between burner shut-off 
and pump shut-off shall be measured within one second accuracy. For 
units having pump delay controls which sense water temperature, the pump 
shall be operated for 15 minutes and t<SUP>+</SUP> shall be 15 minutes. 
While the pump is operating, the inlet water temperature and flow rate 
shall be maintained at the same values as used during the preceding 
steady-state test.
    Make a third flue gas temperature measurement 45 minutes after the 
burner shuts off to determine the off-period minimum flue gas 
temperature (T<INF>F,OFF(I)</INF>).
    During this cool down test, measure the energy input rate to the 
pilot light (Q<INF>P</INF>), if the unit is so equipped, to within an 
error no larger than <plus-minus> 3 percent. Record all measured values. 
For oil fueled units not equipped with stack dampers, maintain the draft 
in the flue within the same ranges specified in section 9.2.1 of ANSI/
ASHRAE 103-82. For direct vent systems with flue dampers or boilers 
equipped with both stack dampers and barometric dampers, close the flue 
or stack damper during the cool down test.
    3.4  Flue gas temperature measurements--heat-up test. The following 
paragraph is in addition to the requirement specified in section 9.3 of 
ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82.
    For furnaces and boilers equipped with step-modulating thermostats, 
the heat-up test shall be conducted at the reduced fuel input rate, as 
specified in section 2.2 of this appendix. For furnaces and boilers 
equipped with two stage controls, separate heat-up tests shall be 
conducted at both the reduced and maximum fuel input rates.
    3.5  Gas and oil fueled boilers. The following paragraph is in place 
of the requirements specified in section 9.3.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82.
    Fifty minutes or more after the main burner(s) is turned off for the 
cool down test, turn on the steam or hot water boiler and measure the 
flue gas temperature at 1.0 (T<INF>f,on(t1)</INF>) and 5.5 
(T<INF>f,on(t2)</INF>) minutes after the main burners are turned on. The 
pump circulating the water through the hot water boiler shall be started 
simultaneously with the main burner(s). The water flow rate shall be the 
same as that maintained during the steady-state test described in 
section 9.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82. During the heat-up test for oil fired 
boilers maintain the draft in the flue pipe within <plus-minus> 0.01 
inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft. 
Record the measured temperatures.
    3.6  Direct measurement of condensate. For condensing furnaces and 
boilers, the condensate heat loss shall be determined either by the 
method specified in section 11.2.33 of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82 or by the 
following test procedures:
    Control devices shall be installed to allow cyclical operation of 
the unit and return water or air flows as described in sections 9.2 and 
9.3 of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82 and sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 of this 
appendix. The test unit shall be leveled prior to test. Operating times 
and beginning and end of condensate collection shall be determined by a 
clock or

[[Page 203]]

timer with a minimum resolution of one second. Humidity of the room air 
shall, at no time, exceed 80 percent.
    Control of on or off operation actions shall be within 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP> 6 seconds of the scheduled time. Condensate drain 
lines shall be attached to the unit as specified in the manufacturer's 
installation instructions. A continuous downward slope of drain lines 
from the unit shall be maintained. Additional precautions shall be taken 
to facilitate uninterrupted flow of condensate during the test.
    The flue pipe installation must not allow condensate formed in the 
flue pipe to flow back into the unit. An initial downward slope from the 
unit's exit, an offset with a drip leg, annular collection rings, or 
drain holes must be included in the flue pipe installation without 
disturbing normal flue gas flow, as specified in section 7.2.2 of ANSI/
ASHRAE 103-82. Flue gases should not flow out of the drain with the 
condensate.
    Collection-containers must be glass or polished stainless steel, so 
removal of interior deposits can be easily made. The collection-
container shall have a vent opening to the atmosphere.
    The scale for measuring the containers and sample condensate mass 
shall be calibrated with an error no larger than <SUP>plus-minus</SUP> 
0.5 percent over the range of interest.
    The condensing furnace or boiler shall be tested by the flue loss 
method in accordance with the provisions for condensing units, as 
specified in section 9 of ASNI/ASHRAE 103-82 and section 3 of this 
appendix. The condensate collection-containers shall be dried prior to 
each use and shall be at room ambient temperature prior to a sample 
collection. Tare weight of the collection-container must be measured and 
recorded prior to each sample collection.
    The unit should be operated in a cyclical manner until flue gas 
temperatures at the end of each on-cycle are within 5 deg. F (2.8 deg. 
C) of each other for two consecutive cycles. On-cycle and off-cycle 
times are listed in Table 2 of this appendix. Begin three test cycles. 
Return air temperature for furnaces shall be as specified in section 9 
of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82 and section 3 of this appendix. Return water 
temperature for boilers shall be as specified in section 2.3 of this 
appendix. Operation of the furnace blower or boiler pump shall conform 
to the time delay requirements specified in sections 9.2 and 9.3 of 
ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82 and sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 of this appendix 
for cool down and heat up tests. Operation of the boiler pump shall 
conform to the time delay requirements specified in section 3.3 of this 
appendix.
    Begin condensate collection at one minute before the on-cycle period 
of the first test cycle. The container shall be removed one minute 
before the end of each off-cycle period of the sixth test cycle. 
Condensate mass shall be measured for each test cycle.
    Fuel input shall be recorded during the entire test period starting 
at the beginning of the on-time period of the first cycle to the 
beginning of the on-time period of the second cycle, etc., for each of 
the test cycles. Fuel higher heating value (HHV), temperature and 
pressures necessary for determining fuel energy input (Q<INF>c</INF>) 
shall be recorded. The fuel quantity and HHV shall be measured with 
errors no greater than one percent. Determine the mass of condensate for 
each cycle (m<INF>c</INF>) in pounds. If at the end of three cycles, the 
sample standard deviation is within 20% of the mean value for 3 cycles 
use total condensate collected in the three cycles as m<INF>c</INF>, if 
not, continue collection for an additional three cycles and use the 
total condensate collected for the six cycles as m<INF>c</INF>. 
Determine the fuel energy input during the three or six test cycles 
(Q<INF>c</INF>) expressed in Btu.
    Begin a steady-state condensate collection after steady-state 
conditions have been achieved as specified in section 8 of ANSI/ASHRAE 
103-82 and section 2 of this appendix. The steady-state collection 
period shall be 30 minutes. Condensate mass shall be measured 
immediately at the end of the collection period to prevent evaporation 
loss from the sample. Fuel input shall be recorded for the one hour 
steady-state test period. Fuel Higher Heating Value (HHV), temperature 
and pressures necessary for determining fuel energy input Q<INF>C,SS</INF> 
will be observed and recorded in Btu's. The fuel quantity and HHV shall 
be measured with errors no greater than one percent. Determine the mass 
of condensate for the steady-state test, m<INF>C,SS</INF>, in pounds by 
subtracting the tare container weight from the total container and 
condensate weight measured at the end of the 30 minutes test period.
    3.7  Direct measurement of off-cycle losses testing method. 
Reserved.
    3.8  Direct measurement of the S/F factors for oil furnaces and 
boilers. For oil furnaces and boilers that are marketed and sold with 
attached barometric dampers, the S/F factor shall be determined either 
by using assigned factors in Table 2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82 or by the 
following test procedure:
    To directly measure the S/F factor, seal the barometric damper plate 
in the closed position. Operate the furnace or boiler until steady-state 
temperatures are attained. Adjust the draft in the flue within one foot 
of the heat exchanger exit to be between 0.075 and 0.085 inch water 
column. A mechanical draft inducer or a natural draft developed by 
adjusting the height of the test stack may be used. Remove the seal from 
the barometric damper and adjust the damper gate to achieve proper 
draft, as specified by the manufacturer. If the draft over the fire is 
specified as a range, adjust the draft to the mid-point of that range.

[[Page 204]]

    After steady-state conditions are again achieved with the draft 
adjusted as specified, measure CO<INF>2</INF> before and after dilution 
at points marked A and B in Figure 2 of this appendix. To ensure that 
the sample is well mixed after dilution obtain a representative sample 
of stack gas by sampling from several points on a horizontal plane 
through the cross section of the stack. The test setup shown in Figure 2 
enhances the mixing of dilution air and flue gases. Alternatively, a 
straight length of stack or other flue piping arrangement may be used 
with stack samples taken sufficiently downstream after dilution in order 
to obtain a well-mixed sample.
    3.9  Furnaces and boilers that includes small air passages in the 
flue. For furnaces and boilers that includes small air passages in the 
flue where such passage serves a utility other than for draft relief, 
the air passage shall be open during all tests and the test data shall 
be reduced as specified in section 4 of this appendix.
    These units shall be considered as direct exhaust systems, for the 
purposes of this test procedure. These provisions shall not apply to 
systems which allow for air flow through the air passage in excess of 10 
percent of maximum steady state total flue flow; in these cases, such 
passages are to be considered as draft diverters or draft hoods.
    4.0  Calculations. Calculations shall be as specified in section 11 
of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82 with the exception of section 11.2.6, and the 
inclusion of the following additional calculations:
    4.1  Annual fuel utilization efficiency for electric furnaces and 
boilers. The annual fuel utilization efficiency for electric furnaces 
and boilers (AFUE) is equal to the heating seasonal efficiency for 
electric furnaces and boilers (Effy<INF>hs-e</INF>) as defined in 
section 11.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82.
    4.2.  Average ratio of stack gas mass flow rate to flue gas mass 
flow rate at steady-state operation. The following paragraphs are in 
place of the requirements specified in section 11.2.6 of ANSI/ASHRAE

    For gas furnaces and boilers equipped with draft hoods determine the 
S/F by the method set out above or use the assigned value of 2.4. This 
alternative method may be used until 24 months from the effective date 
of the amendment. After that date, the assigned value may not be used 
and only the method set out above may be used.
    For oil furnaces and boilers, S/F shall be 1.40 for units not 
shipped with barometric dampers or for units shipped with barometric 
dampers, S/F shall be either 1.40 or determined by:

S/F=R<INF>T,S</INF>/R<INF>T,F

</INF>where:

R<INF>T,S</INF>=as defined in 11.2.3 of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82 in which the

          appendix is used

    4.3  Optional direct condensate measurement method. For condensing 
furnaces and boilers for which the direct measurement of condensate is 
used, as specified in section 3.6 of this appendix, calculate the part-
load efficiency (<greek-ee><INF>u</INF>) and the steady-state efficiency 
(<greek-ee><INF>SS</INF>) expressed as a percent and defined as:

<greek-ee><INF>u</INF>=Effy<INF>hs</INF>+L<INF>G</INF>-L<INF>C

not more than 5 deg. F (2.8C) in the flue gas temperature for units 
equipped with draft hoods, barometric draft regulators or direct vent 
systems, in three successive readings taken 15 minutes apart or not more 
than 3 deg. F (1.7C) in the stack gas temperature for units equipped 
with integral draft diverters in three successive readings taken 15 
minutes apart.
    1.27  ``Step-modulating control'' means a control that either cycles 
off and on at the low input if the heating load is light, or gradually, 
increases the heat input to meet any higher heating load that cannot be 
met with the low firing rate.
    1.28  ``Thermal stack damper'' means a type of stack damper which is 
dependent for operation exclusively upon the direct conversion of 
thermal energy of the stack gases into movement of the damper plate.

discharging outlets, a five (5) foot long test stack having a cross 
sectional area the same size as the draft diverter outlet.
    Attach to the outlet of vented heaters having a horizontally 
discharging draft diverter or draft hood outlet a 90 degree elbow, and a 
five (5) foot long vertical test stack. A horizontal section of pipe may 
be used on the floor furnace between the diverter and the elbow if 
necessary to clear any framing used in the installation. Use the minimum 
length of pipe possible for this section. Use stack, elbow, and 
horizontal section with same cross sectional area as the diverter 
outlet.

36.3 of UL 896-1973 for oil fueled vented room heaters.
    2.2.3  Direct vent systems. Have the exhaust/air intake system 
supplied by the manufacturer in place during all tests. Test units 
intended for installation with a variety of vent pipe lengths with the 
minimum length recommended by the manufacturer. Do not connect a heater 
employing a direct vent system to a chimney or induced draft source. 
Vent the gas solely on the provision for venting incorporated in the 
heater and the vent/air intake system supplied with it.
    2.3  Fuel supply. 
    2.3.1  Natural gas. For a vented heater utilizing natural gas, 
maintain the gas supply to the unit under test at a normal inlet test 
pressure immediately ahead of all controls at 7 to 10 inches water 
column. Maintain the regulator outlet pressure at normal test pressure 
approximately at that recommended by the manufacturer. Use natural gas 
having a specific gravity of approximately 0.65 and a higher heating 
value within <SUP>plus-minus</SUP> 5 percent of 1,025 Btu's per standard 
cubic foot. Determine the actual higher heating value in Btu's per 
standard cubic foot for the natural gas to be used in the test with an 
error no greater than one percent.
    2.3.2  Propane gas. For a vented heater utilizing propane gas, 
maintain the gas supply to the unit under test at a normal inlet 
pressure of 11 to 13 inches water column and a

[[Page 218]]

pressure, on units so equipped, approximately at that recommended by the 
manufacturer. Use propane having a specific gravity of approximately 
1.53 and a higher heating value within <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>  5 percent 
of 2,500 Btu's per standard cubic foot. Determine the actual higher 
heating value in Btu's per standard cubic foot for the propane to be 
used in the test with an error no greater than one percent.

the actual higher heating value of the gas used in the test with an 
error no greater than one percent.
    2.3.4  Oil supply. For a vented heater utilizing fuel oil, use No. 
1, fuel oil (kerosene) for vaporizing-type burners and either No. 1 or 
No. 2 fuel oil, as specified by the manufacturer, for mechanical 
atomizing type burners. Use No. 1 fuel oil with a viscosity meeting the 
specifications as specified in UL-730-1974, section 36.9. Use test fuel 
conforming to the specifications given in tables 2 and 3 of ANSI 
Standard Z91.1-1972
for No. 1 and No. 2 fuel oil. Measure the higher heating value of the 
test fuel with an error no greater than one percent.
    2.3.5  Electrical supply. For auxiliary electric components of a 
vented heater, maintain the electrical supply to the test unit within 
one percent of the nameplate voltage for the entire test cycle. If a 
voltage range is used for nameplate voltage, maintain the electrical 
supply within one percent of the mid-point of the nameplate voltage 
range.
    2.4  Burner adjustments.
    2.4.1  Gas burner adjustments. Adjust the burners of gas fueled 
vented heaters to their maximum Btu ratings at the test pressure 
specified in section 2.3 of this appendix. Correct the burner volumetric 
flow rate to 60 deg. F (15.6C) and 30 inches of mercury barometric 
pressure, set the fuel flow rate to obtain a heat rate of within 
<plus-minus>2 percent of the hourly Btu rating specified by the 
manufacturer as measured after 15 minutes of operation starting with all 
parts of the vented heater at room temperature. Set the primary air 
shutters in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations to give a 
good flame at this adjustment. Do not allow the deposit of carbon during 
any test specified herein.
    If a vent limiting means is provided on a gas pressure regulator, 
have it in place during all tests.
    For gas fueled heaters with modulating controls adjust the controls 
to operate the heater at the maximum fuel input rate. Set the thermostat 
control to the maximum setting. Start the heater by turning the safety 
control valve to the ``on'' position. In order to prevent modulation of 
the burner at maximum input, place the thermostat sensing element in a 
temperature control bath which is held at a temperature below the 
maximum set point temperature of the control.
    For gas fueled heaters with modulating controls adjust the controls 
to operate the heater at the reduced fuel input rate. Set the thermostat 
control to the minimum setting. Start the heater by turning the safety 
control valve to the ``on'' position. If ambient test room temperature 
is above the lowest control set point temperature, initiate burner 
operation by placing the thermostat sensing element in a temperature 
control bath that is held at a temperature below the minimum set point 
temperature of the control.
    2.4.2  Oil burner adjustments. Adjust the burners of oil fueled 
vented heaters to give the CO<INF>2 </INF>reading recommended by the 
manufacturer and an hourly Btu input, during the steady-state 
performance test described below, which is within <plus-minus>2 percent 
of the heater manufacturer's specified normal hourly Btu input rating. 
On units employing a power burner do not allow smoke in the flue to 
exceed a No. 1 smoke during the steady-state performance test as 
measured by the procedure in ANSI Standard Z11.182-1965 (R1971) (ASTM D 
2156-65 (1970)). If, on units employing a power burner, the smoke in the 
flue exceeds a No. 1 smoke during the steady-state test, readjust the 
burner to give a lower smoke reading, and, if necessary a lower 
CO<INF>2</INF> reading, and start all tests over. Maintain the average 
draft over the fire and in the flue during the steady-state performance 
test at that recommended by the manufacturer within <plus-minus>0.005 
inches of water gauge. Do not make additional adjustments to the burner 
during the required series of performance tests. The instruments and 
measuring apparatus for this test are described in section 6.3 of ANSI 
standard Z91.1-1972.
    2.5  Circulating air adjustments.
    2.5.1  Forced air vented wall furnaces (including direct vent 
systems). During tests maintain the air flow through the heater as 
specified by the manufacturer and operate the vented heater with the 
outlet air temperature between 80 deg. F and 130 deg. F above room 
temperature. If adjustable air discharge registers are provided, adjust 
them so as to provide the maximum possible air restriction. Measure air 
discharge temperature as specified in section 2.14 of ANSI Z21.49-1975.
    2.5.2  Fan type vented room heaters and floor furnaces. During tests 
on fan type furnaces and heaters, adjust the air flow through the heater 
as specified by the manufacturer. If adjustable air discharge registers 
are provided, adjust them to provide the maximum possible air 
restriction.
    2.6  Location of temperature measuring instrumentation.
    2.6.1  Gas fueled vented home heating equipment (including direct 
vent systems). For units

thirds of the distance between the center of the flue pipe and the pipe 
wall.
    Use bead-type thermocouples having wire size not greater than No. 24 
American Wire Gauge (AWG). If there is a possibility that the 
thermocouples could receive direct radiation from the fire, install 
radiation shields on the fire side of the thermocouples only and

junctions.
    Install thermocouples for measuring conditioned warm air temperature 
as described in ANSI Z21.49-1975, section 2.14. Establish the

    Temperature (T<INF>RA</INF>) shall be the arithmetic average 
temperature of the test area, determined by measurement with four No. 24

[[Page 220]]

AWG bead-type thermocouples with junctions shielded against radiation, 
located approximately at 90-degree positions on a circle circumscribing 
the heater or heater
enclosure under test, in a horizontal plane approximately at the 
vertical midpoint of the appliance or test enclosure, and with the 
junctions approximately 24 inches from sides of the heater or test 
enclosure and located so as not to be affected by other than room air. 
Locate a thermocouple at each elevation of draft relief inlet opening 
and combustion air inlet opening at a distance of approximately 24 
inches from the inlet openings. The temperature of the air for 
combustion and the air for draft relief shall not differ more than 
<plus-minus>5<SUP>+</SUP> F from room temperature as measured above.
    2.10  Equipment used to measure mass flow rate in flue and stack. 
The tracer gas chosen for this task should have a density which is less 
than or approximately equal to the density of air. Use a gas unreactive 
with the environment to be encountered. Using instrumentation of either 
the batch or continuous type, measure the concentration of tracer gas 
with an error no greater than 2 percent of the value of the 
concentration measured.
    3.0  Testing and measurements.
    3.1  Steady-state testing.
    3.1.1  Gas fueled vented home heating equipment (including direct 
vent systems). Set up the vented heater as specified in sections 2.1, 
2.2, and 2.3 of this appendix. The draft diverter shall be in the normal 
open condition and the stack shall not be insulated. (Insulation of the 
stack is no longer required for the vented heater test.) Begin the 
steady-state performance test by operating the burner and the 
circulating air blower, on units so equipped, with the adjustments 
specified by sections 2.4.1 and 2.5 of this appendix, until steady-state 
conditions are attained as indicated by a temperature variation of not 
more than 3<SUP>+</SUP>F (1.7 C) in the stack gas temperature for vented 
heaters equipped with draft diverters or 5<SUP>+</SUP>F (2.8 C) in the 
flue gas temperature for vented heaters equipped with either draft hoods 
or direct vent systems; in three successive readings taken 15 minutes 
apart.
    On units employing draft diverters, measure the room temperature 
(T<INF>RA</INF>) as described in section 2.9 of this appendix and 
measure the steady-state stack gas temperature (T<INF>S,SS</INF>) using 
the nine thermocouples located in the 5 foot test stack as specified in 
section 2.6.1 of this appendix. Secure a sample of the stack gases in 
the plane where T<INF>S,SS</INF> is measured or within 3.5 feet 
downstream of this plane. Determine the concentration by volume of 
carbon dioxide (X<INF>CO2S</INF>) present in the dry stack gas. If the 
location of the gas sampling differs from the temperature measurement 
plane, there shall be no air leaks through the stack between these two 
locations.
    On units employing draft hoods or direct vent systems, measure the 
room temperature (T<INF>RA</INF>) as described in section 2.9 of this 
appendix and measure the steady-state flue gas temperature 
(T<INF>F,SS</INF>), using the nine thermocouples located in the flue 
pipe as described in section 2.6.1 of this appendix. Secure a sample of 
the flue gas in the plane of temperature measurement and determine the 
concentration by volume of CO<INF>2</INF> (X<INF>CO2F</INF>) present in 
dry flue gas. In addition, for units employing draft hoods, secure a 
sample of the stack gas in a horizontal plane in the five foot test 
stack located one foot from the test stack inlet; and determine the 
concentration by volume of CO<INF>2</INF> (X<INF>CO2S</INF>) present in 
dry stack gas.
    Determine the steady-state heat input rate (Q<INF>in</INF>) 
including pilot gas by multiplying the measured higher heating value of 
the test gas by the steady-state gas input rate corrected to standard 
conditions of 60<SUP>+</SUP>F and 30 inches of mercury. Use measured 
values of gas temperature and pressure at the meter and the barometric 
pressure to correct the metered gas flow rate to standard conditions.
    After the above test measurements have been completed on units 
employing draft diverters, secure a sample of the flue gases at the exit 
of the heat exchanger(s) and determine the concentration of 
CO<INF>2</INF> (X<INF>CO2F</INF>) present. In obtaining this sample of 
flue gas, move the sampling probe around or use a sample probe with 
multiple sampling ports in order to assure that an average value is 
obtained for the CO<INF>2</INF> concentration. For units with multiple 
heat exchanger outlets, measure the CO<INF>2</INF> concentration in a 
sample from each outlet to obtain the average CO<INF>2</INF> 
concentration for the unit. A manifold (parallel connected sampling 
tubes) may be used to obtain this sample.
    For heaters with single stage thermostat control (wall mounted 
electric thermostats), determine the steady-state efficiency at the 
maximum fuel input rate as specified in section 2.4 of this appendix.
    For gas fueled vented heaters equipped with either two stage 
thermostats or step-modulating thermostats, determine the steady-state 
efficiency at the maximum fuel input rate, as specified in section 2.4.1 
of this appendix, and at the reduced fuel input rate, as specified in 
section 2.4.1 of this appendix.
    For manually controlled gas fueled vented heaters, with various 
input rates determine the steady-state efficiency at a fuel input rate 
that is within <plus-minus>5 percent of 50 percent of the maximum fuel 
input rate. If the heater is designed to use a control that precludes 
operation at other than maximum output (single firing rate) determine 
the steady state efficiency at the maximum input rate only.
    3.1.2  Oil fueled vented home heating equipment (including direct 
vent systems). Set up and adjust the vented heater as specified in

[[Page 221]]

sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3.4 of this appendix. Begin the steady-state 
performance test by operating the burner and the circulating air blower, 
on units so equipped, with the adjustments specified by sections 2.4.2 
and 2.5 of this appendix until steady-state conditions are attained as 
indicated by a temperature variation of not more than 5<SUP>+</SUP>F 
(2.8 C) in the flue gas temperature in three successive readings taken 
15 minutes apart.
    Do not allow smoke in the flue, for units equipped with power 
burners, to exceed a No. 1 smoke during the steady-state performance 
test as measured by the procedure described in ANSI standard Z11.182-
1965 (R1971) (ASTM D 2156-65 (1970)). Maintain the average draft over 
the fire and in the breeching during the steady-state performance test 
at that recommended by the manufacturer <plus-minus>0.005 inches of 
water gauge.
    Measure the room temperature (T<INF>RA</INF>) as described in 
section 2.9 of this appendix and measure the steady-state flue gas 
temperature (T<INF>F,SS</INF>) using nine thermocouples located in the 
flue pipe as described in section 2.6.2 of this appendix. Secure a 
sample of the flue gas in the plane of temperature measurement and 
determine the concentration by volume of 
CO<INF>2</INF>(X<INF>CO2F</INF>) present in dry flue gas. Measure and 
record the steady-state heat input rate (Q<INF>in</INF>).
    For manually controlled oil fueled vented heaters, determine the 
steady-state efficiency at a fuel input rate that is within 
<plus-minus>5 percent of 50 percent of the maximum fuel input rate.
    3.1.3  Auxiliary Electric Power Measurement. Allow the auxiliary 
electrical system of a gas or oil vented heater to operate for at least 
five minutes before recording the maximum auxiliary electric power 
measurement from the wattmeter. Record the maximum electric power 
(P<INF>E</INF>) expressed in kilowatts. For vented heaters with 
modulating controls, the recorded (P<INF>E</INF>) shall be maximum 
measured electric power multiplied by the following factor (R). For two 
stage controls, R=1.3. For step modulating controls, R=1.4 when the 
ratio of minimum-to-maximum fuel input is greater than or equal to 0.7, 
R=1.7 when the ratio of minimum-to-maximum fuel input is less than 0.7 
and greater than or equal to 0.5, and R=2.2 when the ratio of minimum-
to-maximum fuel input is less than 0.5.
    3.2  Jacket loss measurement. Conduct a jacket loss test for vented 
floor furnaces. Measure the jacket loss (L<INF>j</INF>) in accordance 
with the ANSI standard Z21.48-1976 section 2.12.
    3.3  Measurement of the off-cycle losses for vented heaters equipped 
with thermal stack dampers. Install the thermal stack damper according 
to the manufacturer's instructions. Unless specified otherwise, the 
thermal stack damper should be at the draft diverter exit collar. Attach 
a five foot length of bare stack to the outlet of the damper. Install 
thermocouples as specified in section 2.6.1 of this appendix.
    For vented heaters equipped with single stage thermostats, measure 
the off-cycle losses at the maximum fuel input rate. For vented heaters 
equipped with two stage thermostats, measure the off-cycle losses at the 
maximum fuel input rate and at the reduced fuel input rate. For vented 
heaters equipped with step-modulating thermostats, measure the off-cycle 
losses at the reduced fuel input rate.
    Let the vented heater heat up to a steady-state condition. Feed a 
tracer gas at a constant metered rate into the stack directly above and 
within one foot above the stack damper. Record tracer gas flow rate and 
temperature. Measure the tracer gas concentration in the stack at 
several locations in a horizontal plane through a cross section of the 
stack at a point sufficiently above the stack damper to ensure that the 
tracer gas is well mixed in the stack.
    Continuously measure the tracer gas concentration and temperature 
during a 10 minute cool down period. Shut the burner off and immediately 
begin measuring tracer gas concentration in the stack, stack 
temperature, room temperature, and barometric pressure. Record these 
values as the midpoint of each one-minute interval between burner shut 
down and ten minutes after burner shut down. Meter response time and 
sampling delay time shall be considered in timing these measurements.
    3.4  Measurement of the effectiveness of electro-mechanical stack 
dampers. For vented heaters equipped with electro-mechanical stack 
dampers, measure the cross sectional area of the stack (A<INF>s</INF>), 
the net area of the damper plate (A<INF>o</INF>), and the angle that the 
damper plate makes when closed with a plane perpendicular to the axis of 
the stack (<greek-OH>). The net area of the damper plate means the area 
of the damper plate minus the area of any holes through the damper 
plate.
    3.5  Pilot light measurement. Measure the energy input rate to the 
pilot light (Q<INF>p</INF>) with an error no greater than 3 percent for 
vented heaters so equipped.
    3.6  Optional procedure for determining D<INF>p'</INF>D<INF>F'</INF> 
and D<INF>s</INF> for systems for all types of vented heaters. For all 
types of vented heaters, D<INF>p'!</INF>D<INF>F'!</INF>and D<INF>S</INF> 
can be measured by the following optional cool down test.
    Conduct a cool down test by letting the unit heat up until steady-
state conditions are reached, as indicated by temperature variation of 
not more than 5 deg.F (2.8 deg.C) in the flue gas temperature in three 
successive readings taken 15 minutes apart, and then shutting the unit 
off with the stack or flue damper controls by-passed or adjusted so that 
the stack or flue damper remains open during the resulting cool down 
period. If a draft was maintained on oil fueled units in

[[Page 222]]

the flue pipe during the steady-state performance test described in 
section 3.1 of this appendix, maintain the same draft (within a range of 
-.001 to +.005 inches of water gauge of the average steady-state draft) 
during this cool down period.
    Measure the flue gas mass flow rate (m<INF>F,OFF</INF>) during the 
cool down test described above at a specific off-period flue gas 
temperature and corrected to obtain its value at the steady-state flue 
gas temperature (T<INF>F,SS</INF>), using the procedure described below.
    Within one minute after the unit is shut off to start the cool down 
test for determining D<INF>F</INF>, begin feeding a tracer gas into the 
combustion chamber at a constant flow rate of V<INF>T</INF>, and at a 
point which will allow for the best possible mixing with the air flowing 
through the chamber. (On units equipped with an oil fired power burner, 
the best location for injecting this tracer gas appears to be through a 
hole drilled in the air tube.) Periodically measure the value of V<INF>T</INF> 
with an instantaneously reading flow meter having an accuracy of 
<plus-minus>3 percent of the quantity measured. Maintain V<INF>T</INF> 
at less than 1 percent of the air flow rate through the furnace. If a 
combustible tracer gas is used, there should be a delay period between 
the time the burner gas is shut off and the time the tracer gas is first 
injected to prevent ignition of the tracer gas.
    Between 5 and 6 minutes after the unit is shut off to start the cool 
down test, measure at the exit of the heat exchanger the average flue 
gas temperature, T*<INF>F,Off</INF>. At the same instant the flue gas 
temperature is measured, also measure the percent volumetric 
concentration of tracer gas C<INF>T</INF> in the flue gas in the same 
plane where T*<INF>F,Off</INF> is determined. Obtain the concentration 
of tracer gas using an instrument which will result in an accuracy of 
<plus-minus>2 percent in the value of C<INF>T</INF> measured. If use of 
a continuous reading type instrument results in a delay time between 
drawing of a sample and its analysis, this delay should be taken into 
account so that the temperature measurement and the measurement of 
tracer gas concentration coincide. In addition, determine the 
temperature of the tracer gas entering the flow meter (T<INF>T</INF>) 
and the barometric pressure (P<INF>B</INF>).
    The rate of the flue gas mass flow through the vented heater and the 
factors D<INF>P</INF>, D<INF>F</INF>, and D<INF>S</INF> are calculated 
by the equations in sections 4.5.1 through 4.5.3 of this appendix.

                              1. Objectives

    This Appendix establishes procedures, interpretations and policies 
to guide the DOE in the consideration and promulgation of new or revised 
appliance efficiency standards under the Energy Policy and Conservation 
Act (EPCA). The Department's objectives in establishing these guidelines 
include:
    (a) Provide for early input from stakeholders. The Department seeks 
to provide opportunities for public input early in the rulemaking 
process so that the initiation and direction of rulemakings is informed 
by comment from interested parties. Under the guidelines established by 
this Appendix, DOE will seek early input from interested parties in 
setting rulemaking priorities and structuring the analyses for 
particular products. Interested parties will be invited to provide input 
for the selection of design options and will help DOE identify analysis, 
data, and modeling needs. DOE will gather input from interested parties 
through a variety of mechanisms, including public workshops.
    (b) Increase predictability of the rulemaking timetable. The 
Department seeks to make informed, strategic decisions about how to 
deploy its resources on the range of possible standards development 
activities, and to announce these prioritization decisions so that all 
interested parties have a common expectation about the timing of 
different rulemaking activities. The guidelines in this Appendix provide 
for setting priorities and timetables for standards development and test 
procedure modification and reflect these priorities in the Regulatory 
Agenda.
    (c) Increase use of outside technical expertise. The Department 
seeks to expand its use of outside technical experts in evaluating 
product-specific engineering issues to ensure that decisions on 
technical issues are fully informed. The guidelines in this Appendix 
provide for increased use of outside technical experts in developing, 
performing and reviewing the analyses. Draft analytical results will be 
distributed for peer and stakeholder review.
    (d) Eliminate problematic design options early in the process. The 
Department seeks to eliminate from consideration, early in the process, 
any design options that present unacceptable problems with respect to 
manufacturability, consumer utility, or safety, so that the detailed 
analysis can focus only on viable design options. Under the guidelines 
in this Appendix, DOE will eliminate from consideration design options 
if it concludes that manufacture, installation or service of the design 
will be impractical, or that the design option will adversely affect the 
utility of the product, or if the design has adverse safety or health 
impacts. This screening will be done at the outset of a rulemaking.
    (e) Fully consider non-regulatory approaches. The Department seeks 
to understand the effects of market forces and voluntary programs on 
encouraging the purchase of energy efficient products so that the 
incremental impacts of a new or revised standard can be accurately 
assessed and the Department can make informed decisions about where 
standards and voluntary ``market pull'' programs can be used most 
effectively. Under the guidelines in this Appendix, DOE will solicit 
information on the effectiveness of market forces and non-regulatory 
approaches for encouraging the purchase of energy efficient products, 
and will carefully consider this information in assessing the benefits 
of standards. In addition, DOE will continue to support voluntary 
efforts by manufacturers, retailers, utilities and others to increase 
product efficiency.
    (f) Conduct thorough analysis of impacts. In addition to 
understanding the aggregate costs and benefits of standards, the 
Department seeks to understand the distribution of those costs and 
benefits among consumers, manufacturers and others, and the uncertainty 
associated with these analyses of costs and benefits, so that any 
adverse impacts on significant subgroups and uncertainty concerning any 
adverse impacts can be fully considered in selecting a standard. Under 
the guidelines in this Appendix, the analyses will consider the 
variability of impacts on significant groups of manufacturers and 
consumers in addition to aggregate costs and benefits, report the range 
of uncertainty associated with these impacts, and take into account 
cumulative impacts of regulation on manufacturers.
    (g) Use transparent and robust analytical methods.  The Department 
seeks to use qualitative and quantitative analytical methods that are 
fully documented for the public and that produce results that can be 
explained and reproduced, so that the analytical underpinnings for 
policy decisions on standards are as sound and well-accepted as 
possible. Under the guidelines in this Appendix, DOE will solicit input 
from interested parties in identifying analysis, data, and modeling 
needs with respect to measurement of impacts on manufacturers and 
consumers.
    (h) Articulate policies to guide selection of standards. The 
Department seeks to adopt policies elaborating on the statutory criteria 
for selecting standards, so that interested parties are aware of the 
policies that will guide these decisions. Under the guidelines in this 
Appendix, policies for screening design options, selecting candidate 
standard levels, selecting a proposed standard level, and establishing 
the final standard are established.

[[Page 239]]

    (i) Support efforts to build consensus on standards. The Department 
seeks to encourage development of consensus proposals for new or revised 
standards because standards with such broad-based support are likely to 
balance effectively the economic, energy, and environmental interests 
affected by standards. Under the guidelines in this Appendix, DOE will 
support the development and submission of consensus recommendations for 
standards by representative groups of interested parties to the fullest 
extent possible.
    (j) Reduce time and cost of developing standards. The Department 
seeks to establish a clear protocol for initiating and conducting 
standards rulemakings in order to eliminate time-consuming and costly 
missteps. Under the guidelines in this Appendix, increased and earlier 
involvement by interested parties and increased use of technical experts 
should minimize the need for re-analysis. This process should reduce the 
period between the publication of an Advance Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (ANOPR) and the publication of a final rule to not more than 
18 months, and should decrease the government and private sector 
resources required to complete the standard development process.

                                2. Scope

    (a) The procedures, interpretations and policies described in this 
Appendix will be fully applicable to:
    (1) Rulemakings concerning new or revised Federal energy 
conservation standards for consumer products initiated after August 14, 
1996, and
    (2) Rulemakings concerning new or revised Federal energy 
conservation standards for consumer products that have been initiated 
but for which a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) has not been 
published as of August 14, 1996.
    (b) For rulemakings described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, 
to the extent analytical work has already been done or public comment on 
an ANOPR has already been provided, such analyses and comment will be 
considered, as appropriate, in proceeding under the new process.
    (c) With respect to incomplete rulemakings concerning new or revised 
Federal energy conservation standards for consumer products for which a 
NOPR was published prior to August 14, 1996, the Department will conduct 
a case-by-case review to decide whether any of the analytical or 
procedural steps already completed should be repeated. In any case, the 
approach described in this Appendix will be used to the extent possible 
to conduct any analytical or procedural steps that have not been 
completed.

              3. Setting Priorities for Rulemaking Activity

    (a) Priority-setting analysis and development of list of priorities. 
At least once a year, the Department will prepare an analysis of each of 
the factors identified in paragraph (d) of this section based on 
existing literature, direct communications with interested parties and 
other experts, and other available information. The results of this 
analysis will be used to develop rulemaking priorities and proposed 
schedules for the development and issuance of all rulemakings. The DOE 
analysis, priorities and proposed rulemaking schedules will be 
documented and distributed for review and comment.
    (b) Public review and comment. Each year, DOE will invite public 
input to review and comment on the priority analysis.
    (c) Issuance of final listing of rulemaking priorities. Each fall, 
the Department will issue, simultaneously with the issuance of the 
Administration's Regulatory Agenda, a final set of rulemaking 
priorities, the accompanying analysis, and the schedules for all 
priority rulemakings that it anticipates within the next two years.
    (d) Factors for priority-setting. The factors to be considered by 
DOE in developing priorities and establishing schedules for conducting 
rulemakings will include:
    (1) Potential energy savings.
    (2) Potential economic benefits.
    (3) Potential environmental or energy security benefits.
    (4) Applicable deadlines for rulemakings.
    (5) Incremental DOE resources required to complete rulemaking 
process.
    (6) Other relevant regulatory actions affecting products.
    (7) Stakeholder recommendations.
    (8) Evidence of energy efficiency gains in the market absent new or 
revised standards.
    (9) Status of required changes to test procedures.
    (10) Other relevant factors.

    4. Process for Developing Efficiency Standards and Factors to be 
                               Considered

    This section describes the process to be used in developing 
efficiency standards and the factors to be considered in the process. 
The policies of the Department to guide the selection of standards and 
the decisions preliminary thereto are described in section 5.
    (a) Identifying and screening design options. Once the Department 
has initiated a rulemaking for a specific product but before publishing 
an ANOPR, DOE will identify the product categories and design options to 
be analyzed in detail, and identify those design options eliminated from 
further consideration. Interested parties will be consulted to identify 
key issues, develop a list of design options, and to help the Department 
identify the expertise necessary to conduct the analysis.

[[Page 240]]

    (1) Identification of issues for analysis. The Department, in 
consultation with interested parties, will identify issues that will be 
examined in the standards development process.
    (2) Identification of experts and other interested parties for peer 
review. DOE, in consultation with interested parties, will identify a 
group of independent experts and other interested parties who can 
provide expert review of the results of the engineering analysis and the 
subsequent impact analysis.
    (3) Identification and screening of design options. In consultation 
with interested parties, the Department will develop a list of design 
options for consideration. Initially, the candidate design options will 
encompass all those technologies considered to be technologically 
feasible. Following the development of this initial list of design 
options, DOE will review each design option based on the factors 
described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section and the policies stated in 
section 5(b). The reasons for eliminating any design option at this 
stage of the process will be fully documented and published as part of 
the ANOPR. The technologically feasible design options that are not 
eliminated in this screening will be considered further in the 
Engineering Analysis described in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (4) Factors for screening of design options. The factors for 
screening design options include:
    (i) Technological feasibility. Technologies incorporated in 
commercial products or in working prototypes will be considered 
technologically feasible.
    (ii) Practicability to manufacture, install and service. If mass 
production of a technology in commercial products and reliable 
installation and servicing of the technology could be achieved on the 
scale necessary to serve the relevant market at the time of the 
effective date of the standard, then that technology will be considered 
practicable to manufacture, install and service.
    (iii) Adverse Impacts on Product Utility or Product Availability.
    (iv) Adverse Impacts on Health or Safety.
    (5) Selection of contractors. Using the specifications of necessary 
contractor expertise developed in consultation with interested parties, 
DOE will select appropriate contractors, subcontractors, and as 
necessary, expert consultants to perform the engineering analysis and 
the impact analysis.
    (b) Engineering analysis of design options and selection of 
candidate standard levels. After design options are identified and 
screened, DOE will perform the engineering analysis and the benefit/cost 
analysis and select the candidate standard levels based on these 
analyses. The results of the analyses will be published in a Technical 
Support Document (TSD) to accompany the ANOPR.
    (1) Identification of engineering analytical methods and tools. DOE, 
in consultation with outside experts, will select the specific 
engineering analysis tools (or multiple tools, if necessary to address 
uncertainty) to be used in the analysis of the design options identified 
as a result of the screening analysis.
    (2) Engineering and life-cycle cost analysis of design options. The 
DOE and its contractor will perform engineering and life-cycle cost 
analyses of the design options.
    (3) Review by expert group and stakeholders. The results of the 
engineering and life-cycle cost analyses will be distributed for review 
by experts and interested parties. If appropriate, a public workshop 
will be conducted to review these results. The analyses will be revised 
as appropriate on the basis of this input.
    (4) New information relating to the factors used for screening 
design options. If further information or analysis leads to a 
determination that a design option, or a combination of design options, 
has unacceptable impacts based on the policies stated in section 5(b), 
that design option or combination of design options will not be included 
in a candidate standard level.
    (5) Selection of candidate standard levels. Based on the results of 
the engineering and life-cycle cost analysis of design options and the 
policies stated in section 5(c), DOE will select the candidate standard 
levels for further analysis.
    (c) Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
    (1) Documentation of decisions on candidate standard selection. (i) 
If the screening analysis indicates that continued development of a 
standard is appropriate, the Department will publish an ANOPR in the 
Federal Register and will distribute a draft TSD containing the analyses 
performed to this point. The ANOPR will specify candidate standard 
levels but will not propose a particular standard. The ANOPR will also 
include the preliminary analysis of consumer life-cycle costs, national 
net present value, and energy impacts for the candidate standard levels 
based on the engineering analysis.
    (ii) If the preliminary analysis indicates that no candidate 
standard level is likely to meet the criteria specified in law, that 
conclusion will be announced. In such cases, the Department may decide 
to proceed with a rulemaking that proposes not to adopt new or amended 
standards, or it may suspend the rulemaking and conclude that further 
action on such standards should be assigned a low priority under section 
3.
    (2) Public comment and hearing. There will be 75 days for public 
comment on the ANOPR with at least one public hearing or workshop.
    (3) Revisions based on comments. Based on consideration of the 
comments received, any

[[Page 241]]

necessary changes to the engineering analysis or the candidate standard 
levels will be made.
    If major changes are required at this stage, interested parties and 
experts will be given an opportunity to review the revised analysis.
    (d) Analysis of impacts and selection of proposed standard level. 
After the ANOPR, economic analyses of the impacts of the candidate 
standard levels will be conducted. The Department will propose updated 
standards based on the results of the impact analysis.
    (1) Identification of issues for analysis. The Department, in 
consultation with interested parties, will identify issues that will be 
examined in the impacts analysis.
    (2) Identification of analytical methods and tools. DOE, in 
consultation with outside experts, will select the specific economic 
analysis tools (or multiple tools if necessary to address uncertainty) 
to be used in the analysis of the candidate standard levels.
    (3) Analysis of impacts. DOE will conduct the analysis of the 
impacts of candidate standard levels including analysis of the factors 
described in paragraphs (d)(7)(ii)-(viii) of this section.
    (4) Review by expert group and stakeholders. The results of the 
analysis of impacts will be distributed for review by experts and 
interested parties. If appropriate, a public workshop will be conducted 
to review these results. The analysis will be revised as appropriate on 
the basis of this input.
    (5) Efforts to develop consensus among stakeholders. If a 
representative group of interested parties undertakes to develop joint 
recommendations to the Department on standards, DOE will consider 
deferring its impact analysis until these discussions are completed or 
until participants in the efforts indicate that they are unable to reach 
a timely agreement.
    (6) Selection of proposed standard level based on analysis of 
impacts. On the basis of the analysis of the factors described in 
paragraph (d)(7) of this section and the policies stated in section 
5(e), DOE will select a proposed standard level.
    (7) Factors to be considered in selecting a proposed standard. The 
factors to be considered in selection of a proposed standard include:
    (i) Consensus stakeholder recommendations.
    (ii) Impacts on manufacturers. The analysis of manufacturer impacts 
will include: Estimated impacts on cash flow; assessment of impacts on 
manufacturers of specific categories of products and small 
manufacturers; assessment of impacts on manufacturers of multiple 
product-specific Federal regulatory requirements, including efficiency 
standards for other products and regulations of other agencies; and 
impact on manufacturing capacity, plant closures, and loss of capital 
investment.
    (iii) Impacts on consumers. The analysis of consumer impacts will 
include: Estimated impacts on consumers based on national average energy 
prices and energy usage; assessments of impacts on subgroups of 
consumers based on major regional differences in usage or energy prices 
and significant variations in installation costs or performance; 
sensitivity analyses using high and low discount rates and high and low 
energy price forecasts; consideration of changes to product utility and 
other impacts of likely concern to all or some consumers, based to the 
extent practicable on direct input from consumers; estimated life-cycle 
cost with sensitivity analysis; and consideration of the increased first 
cost to consumers and the time required for energy cost savings to pay 
back these first costs.
    (iv) Impacts on competition.
    (v) Impacts on utilities. The analysis of utility impacts will 
include estimated marginal impacts on electric and gas utility costs and 
revenues.
    (vi) National energy, economic and employment impacts. The analysis 
of national energy, economic and employment impacts will include: 
Estimated energy savings by fuel type; estimated net present value of 
benefits to all consumers; and estimates of the direct and indirect 
impacts on employment by appliance manufacturers, relevant service 
industries, energy suppliers and the economy in general.
    (vii) Impacts on the environment and energy security. The analysis 
of environmental and energy security impacts will include estimated 
impacts on emissions of carbon and relevant criteria pollutants, impacts 
on pollution control costs, and impacts on oil use.
    (viii) Impacts of non-regulatory approaches. The analysis of energy 
savings and consumer impacts will incorporate an assessment of the 
impacts of market forces and existing voluntary programs in promoting 
product efficiency, usage and related characteristics in the absence of 
updated efficiency standards.
    (ix) New information relating to the factors used for screening 
design options.
    (e) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
    (1) Documentation of decisions on proposed standard selection. The 
Department will publish a NOPR in the Federal Register that proposes 
standard levels and explains the basis for the selection of those 
proposed levels, and will distribute a draft TSD documenting the 
analysis of impacts. As required by Sec. 325(p)(2) of EPCA, the NOPR 
also will describe the maximum improvement in energy efficiency or 
maximum reduction in energy use that is technologically feasible and, if 
the proposed standards would not achieve these levels, the reasons for 
proposing different standards.
    (2) Public comment and hearing. There will be 75 days for public 
comment on the NOPR,

[[Page 242]]

with at least one public hearing or workshop.
    (3) Revisions to impact analyses and selection of final standard. 
Based on the public comments received and the policies stated in section 
5(f), DOE will review the proposed standard and impact analyses, and 
make modifications as necessary. If major changes to the analyses are 
required at this stage, interested parties and experts will be given an 
opportunity to review the revised analyses.
    (f) Notice of Final Rulemaking. The Department will publish a Notice 
of Final Rulemaking in the Federal Register that promulgates standard 
levels and explains the basis for the selection of those standards, 
accompanied by a final TSD.

                 5. Policies on Selection of Standards.

    (a) Purpose. (1) Section 4 describes the process that will be used 
to consider new or revised energy efficiency standards and lists a 
number of factors and analyses that will be considered at specified 
points in the process. Department policies concerning the selection of 
new or revised standards, and decisions preliminary thereto, are 
described in this section.
    These policies are intended to elaborate on the statutory criteria 
provided in section 325 of the EPCA, 42 U.S.C. 6295.
    (2) The policies described below are intended to provide guidance 
for making the determinations required by EPCA. This statement of policy 
is not intended to preclude consideration of any information pertinent 
to the statutory criteria. The Department will consider all pertinent 
information in determining whether a new or revised standard is 
consistent with the statutory criteria. Moreover, the Department will 
not be guided by a policy in this section if, in the particular 
circumstances presented, such a policy would lead to a result 
inconsistent with the criteria in section 325 of EPCA.
    (b) Screening design options. Section 4(a)(4) lists factors to be 
considered in screening design options. These factors will be considered 
as follows in determining whether a design option will receive any 
further consideration:
    (1) Technological feasibility. Technologies that are not 
incorporated in commercial products or in working prototypes will not be 
considered further.
    (2) Practicability to manufacture, install and service. If it is 
determined that mass production of a technology in commercial products 
and reliable installation and servicing of the technology could not be 
achieved on the scale necessary to serve the relevant market at the time 
of the effective date of the standard, then that technology will not be 
considered further.
    (3) Impacts on product utility to consumers. If a technology is 
determined to have significant adverse impact on the utility of the 
product to significant subgroups of consumers, or result in the 
unavailability of any covered product type with performance 
characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, 
and volumes that are substantially the same as products generally 
available in the U.S. at the time, it will not be considered further.
    (4) Safety of technologies. If it is determined that a technology 
will have significant adverse impacts on health or safety, it will not 
be considered further.
    (c) Identification of candidate standard levels. Based on the 
results of the engineering and cost and benefit analyses of design 
options, DOE will identify the candidate standard levels for further 
analysis. Candidate standard levels will be selected as follows:
    (1) Costs and savings of design options. Design options which have 
payback periods that exceed the average life of the product or which 
cause life-cycle cost increases relative to the base case, using typical 
fuel costs, usage and discount rates, will not be used as the basis for 
candidate standard levels.
    (2) Further information on factors used for screening design 
options. If further information or analysis leads to a determination 
that a design option, or a combination of design options, has 
unacceptable impacts under the policies stated in paragraph (b) of this 
section, that design option or combination of design options will not be 
included in a candidate standard level.
    (3) Selection of candidate standard levels. Candidate standard 
levels, which will be identified in the ANOPR and on which impact 
analyses will be conducted, will be based on the remaining design 
options.
    (i) The range of candidate standard levels will typically include:
    (A) The most energy efficient combination of design options;
    (B) The combination of design options with the lowest life-cycle 
cost; and
    (C) A combination of design options with a payback period of not 
more than three years.
    (ii) Candidate standard levels that incorporate noteworthy 
technologies or fill in large gaps between efficiency levels of other 
candidate standard levels also may be selected.
    (d) Advance notice of proposed rulemaking. New information provided 
in public comments on the ANOPR will be considered to determine whether 
any changes to the candidate standard levels are needed before 
proceeding to the analysis of impacts. This review, and any appropriate 
adjustments, will be based on the policies in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (e) Selection of proposed standard. Based on the results of the 
analysis of impacts, DOE will select a standard level to be proposed for 
public comment in the NOPR. Section 4(d)(7) lists the factors to be 
considered in selecting a proposed standard level. Section

[[Page 243]]

325(o)(2)(A) of EPCA provides that any new or revised standard must be 
designed to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency that is 
determined to be technologically feasible and economically justified.
    (1) Statutory policies. The fundamental policies concerning 
selection of standards are established in the EPCA, including the 
following:
    (i) A candidate standard level will not be proposed or promulgated 
if the Department determines that it is not technologically feasible and 
economically justified. See EPCA section 325(o)(3)(B). A standard level 
is economically justified if the benefits exceed the burdens. See EPCA 
section 325(o)(2)(B)(i). A standard level is rebuttably presumed to be 
economically justified if the payback period is three years or less. See 
EPCA section 325(o)(2)(B)(iii).
    (ii) If the Department determines that a standard level is likely to 
result in the unavailability of any covered product type with 
performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, 
capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as products 
generally available in the U.S. at the time, that standard level will 
not be proposed. See EPCA section 325(o)(4).
    (iii) If the Department determines that a standard level would not 
result in significant conservation of energy, that standard level will 
not be proposed. See EPCA section 325(o)(3)(B).
    (2) Selection of proposed standard on the basis of consensus 
stakeholder recommendations. Development of consensus proposals for new 
or revised standards is an effective mechanism for balancing the 
economic, energy, and environmental interests affected by standards. 
Thus, notwithstanding any other policy on selection of proposed 
standards, a consensus recommendation on an updated efficiency level 
submitted by a group that represents all interested parties will be 
proposed by the Department if it is determined to meet the statutory 
criteria.
    (3) Considerations in assessing economic justification.
    (i) The following policies will guide the application of the 
economic justification criterion in selecting a proposed standard:
    (A) If the Department determines that a candidate standard level 
would result in a negative return on investment for the industry, would 
significantly reduce the value of the industry, or would cause 
significant adverse impacts to a significant subgroup of manufacturers 
(including small manufacturing businesses), that standard level will be 
presumed not to be economically justified unless the Department 
determines that specifically identified expected benefits of the 
standard would outweigh this and any other expected adverse effects.
    (B) If the Department determines that a candidate standard level 
would be the direct cause of plant closures, significant losses in 
domestic manufacturer employment, or significant losses of capital 
investment by domestic manufacturers, that standard level will be 
presumed not to be economically justified unless the Department 
determines that specifically identified expected benefits of the 
standard would outweigh this and any other expected adverse effects.
    (C) If the Department determines that a candidate standard level 
would have a significant adverse impact on the environment or energy 
security, that standard level will be presumed not to be economically 
justified unless the Department determines that specifically identified 
expected benefits of the standard would outweigh this and any other 
expected adverse effects.
    (D) If the Department determines that a candidate standard level 
would not result in significant energy conservation relative to non-
regulatory approaches, that standard level will be presumed not to be 
economically justified unless the Department determines that other 
specifically identified expected benefits of the standard would outweigh 
the expected adverse effects.
    (E) If the Department determines that a candidate standard level is 
not consistent with the policies relating to practicability to 
manufacture, consumer utility, or safety in paragraphs (b) (2), (3) and 
(4) of this section, that standard level will be presumed not to be 
economically justified unless the Department determines that 
specifically identified expected benefits of the standard would outweigh 
this and any other expected adverse effects.
    (F) If the Department determines that a candidate standard level is 
not consistent with the policies relating to consumer costs in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, that standard level will be presumed not to be 
economically justified unless the Department determines that 
specifically identified expected benefits of the standard would outweigh 
this and any other expected adverse effects.
    (G) If the Department determines that a candidate standard level 
will have significant adverse impacts on a significant subgroup of 
consumers (including low-income consumers), that standard level will be 
presumed not to be economically justified unless the Department 
determines that specifically identified expected benefits of the 
standard would outweigh this and any other expected adverse effects.
    (H) If the Department or the Department of Justice determines that a 
candidate standard level would have significant anticompetitive effects, 
that standard level will be presumed not to be economically justified 
unless the Department determines that specifically identified expected 
benefits of the

[[Page 244]]

standard would outweigh this and any other expected adverse effects.
    (ii) The basis for a determination that triggers any presumption in 
paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section and the basis for a determination 
that an applicable presumption has been rebutted will be supported by 
substantial evidence in the record and the evidence and rationale for 
making these determinations will be explained in the NOPR.
    (iii) If none of the policies in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section 
is found to be dispositive, the Department will determine whether the 
benefits of a candidate standard level exceed the burdens considering 
all the pertinent information in the record.
    (f) Selection of a final standard. New information provided in the 
public comments on the NOPR and any analysis by the Department of 
Justice concerning impacts on competition of the proposed standard will 
be considered to determine whether any change to the proposed standard 
level is needed before proceeding to the final rule. The same policies 
used to select the proposed standard level, as described in section 5(e) 
above, will be used to guide the selection of the final standard level.

                     6. Effective Date of a Standard

    The effective date for new or revised standards will be established 
so that the period between the publication of the final rule and the 
effective date is not less than any period between the dates for 
publication and effective date provided for in EPCA. The effective date 
of any revised standard will be established so that the period between 
the effective date of the prior standard and the effective date of such 
revised standard is not less than period between the two effective dates 
provided for in EPCA.

                           7. Test Procedures

    (a) Identifying the need to modify test procedures. DOE, in 
consultation with interested parties, experts, and the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology, will attempt to identify any 
necessary modifications to established test procedures when initiating 
the standards development process.
    (b) Developing and proposing revised test procedures. Needed 
modifications to test procedures will be identified in consultation with 
experts and interested parties early in the screening stage of the 
standards development process. Any necessary modifications will be 
proposed before issuance of an ANOPR in the standards development 
process.
    (c) Issuing final test procedure modification. Final, modified test 
procedures will be issued prior to the NOPR on proposed standards.
    (d) Effective date of modified test procedures. If required only for 
the evaluation and issuance of updated efficiency standards, modified 
test procedures typically will not go into effect until the effective 
date of updated standards.

                  8. Joint Stakeholder Recommendations

    (a) Joint recommendations. Consensus recommendations, and supporting 
analyses, submitted by a representative group of interested parties will 
be given substantial weight by DOE in the development of a proposed 
rule. See section 5(e)(2). If the supporting analyses provided by the 
group addresses all of the statutory criteria and uses valid economic 
assumptions and analytical methods, DOE expects to use this supporting 
analyses as the basis of a proposed rule. The proposed rule will explain 
any deviations from the consensus recommendations from interested 
parties.
    (b) Breadth of participation. Joint recommendations will be of most 
value to the Department if the participants are reasonably 
representative of those interested in the outcome of the standards 
development process, including manufacturers, consumers, utilities, 
states and representatives of environmental or energy efficiency 
interest groups.
    (c) DOE support of consensus development, including impact analyses. 
In order to facilitate such consensus development, DOE will make 
available, upon request, appropriate technical and legal support to the 
group and will provide copies of all relevant public documents and 
analyses. The Department also will consider any requests for its active 
participation in such discussions, recognizing that the procedural 
requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act may apply to such 
participation.

          9. Principles for the Conduct of Engineering Analysis

    (a) The purpose of the engineering analysis is to develop the 
relationship between efficiency and cost of the subject product. The 
Department will use the most appropriate means available to determine 
the efficiency/cost relationship, including an overall system approach 
or engineering modeling to predict the improvement in efficiency that 
can be expected from individual design options as discussed in the 
paragraphs below. From this efficiency/cost relationship, measures such 
as payback, life cycle cost, and energy savings can be developed. The 
Department, in consultation with interested parties, will identify 
issues that will be examined in the engineering analysis and the types 
of specialized expertise that may be required. With these 
specifications, DOE will select appropriate contractors, subcontractors, 
and expert consultants, as necessary, to

[[Page 245]]

perform the engineering analysis and the impact analysis. Also, the 
Department will consider data, information and analyses received from 
interested parties for use in the analysis wherever feasible.
    (b) The engineering analysis begins with the list of design options 
developed in consultation with the interested parties as a result of the 
screening process. In consultation with the technology/industry expert 
peer review group, the Department will establish the likely cost and 
performance improvement of each design option. Ranges and uncertainties 
of cost and performance will be established, although efforts will be 
made to minimize uncertainties by using measures such as test data or 
component or material supplier information where available. Estimated 
uncertainties will be carried forward in subsequent analyses. The use of 
quantitative models will be supplemented by qualitative assessments as 
appropriate.
    (c) The next step includes identifying, modifying or developing any 
engineering models necessary to predict the efficiency impact of any one 
or combination of design options on the product. A base case 
configuration or starting point will be established as well as the order 
and combination/blending of the design options to be evaluated. The DOE, 
utilizing expert consultants, will then perform the engineering analysis 
and develop the cost efficiency curve for the product. The cost 
efficiency curve and any necessary models will be subject to peer review 
before being issued with the ANOPR.

       10. Principles for the Analysis of Impacts on Manufacturers

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of the manufacturer analysis is to identify 
the likely impacts of efficiency standards on manufacturers. The 
Department will analyze the impact of standards on manufacturers with 
substantial input from manufacturers and other interested parties. The 
use of quantitative models will be supplemented by qualitative 
assessments by industry experts. This section describes the principles 
that will be used in conducting future manufacturing impact analysis.
    (b) Issue identification. In the impact analysis stage (section 
4(d)), the Department, in consultation with interested parties, will 
identify issues that will require greater consideration in the detailed 
manufacturer impact analysis. Possible issues may include identification 
of specific types or groups of manufacturers and concerns over access to 
technology. Specialized contractor expertise, empirical data 
requirements, and analytical tools required to perform the manufacturer 
impact analysis also would be identified at this stage.
    (c) Industry characterization. Prior to initiating detailed impact 
studies, the Department will seek input on the present and past industry 
structure and market characteristics. Input on the following issues will 
be sought:
    (1) Manufacturers and their relative market shares;
    (2) Manufacturer characteristics, such as whether manufacturers make 
a full line of models or serve a niche market;
    (3) Trends in the number of manufacturers;
    (4) Financial situation of manufacturers;
    (5) Trends in product characteristics and retail markets; and
    (6) Identification of other relevant regulatory actions and a 
description of the nature and timing of any likely impacts.
    (d) Cost impacts on manufacturers. The costs of labor, material, 
engineering, tooling, and capital are difficult to estimate, 
manufacturer-specific, and usually proprietary. The Department will seek 
input from interested parties on the treatment of cost issues. 
Manufacturers will be encouraged to offer suggestions as to possible 
sources of data and appropriate data collection methodologies. Costing 
issues to be addressed include:
    (1) Estimates of total cost impacts, including product-specific 
costs (based on cost impacts estimated for the engineering analysis) and 
front-end investment/conversion costs for the full range of product 
models.
    (2) Range of uncertainties in estimates of average cost, considering 
alternative designs and technologies which may vary cost impacts and 
changes in costs of material, labor and other inputs which may vary 
costs.
    (3) Variable cost impacts on particular types of manufacturers, 
considering factors such as atypical sunk costs or characteristics of 
specific models which may increase or decrease costs.
    (e) Impacts on product sales, features, prices and cost recovery. In 
order to make manufacturer cash flow calculations, it is necessary to 
predict the number of products sold and their sale price. This requires 
an assessment of the likely impacts of price changes on the number of 
products sold and on typical features of models sold. Past analyses have 
relied on price and shipment data generated by economic models. The 
Department will develop additional estimates of prices and shipments by 
drawing on multiple sources of data and experience including: actual 
shipment and pricing experience, data from manufacturers, retailers and 
other market experts, financial models, and sensitivity analyses. The 
possible impacts of candidate standard levels on consumer choices among 
competing fuels will be explicitly considered where relevant.
    (f) Measures of impact. The manufacturer impact analysis will 
estimate the impacts of candidate standard levels on the net cash flow 
of manufacturers. Computations will be performed for the industry as a 
whole and for typical and atypical manufacturers. The exact nature and 
the process by which the

[[Page 246]]

analysis will be conducted will be determined by DOE, in conjunction 
with interested parties. Impacts to be analyzed include:
    (1) Industry net present value, with sensitivity analyses based on 
uncertainty of costs, sales prices and sales volumes;
    (2) Cash flows, by year;
    (3) Other measures of impact, such as revenue, net income and return 
on equity, as appropriate;
    The characteristics of atypical manufacturers worthy of special 
consideration will be determined in consultation with manufacturers and 
other interested parties and may include: manufacturers incurring higher 
or lower than average costs; and manufacturers experiencing greater or 
fewer adverse impacts on sales. Alternative scenarios based on other 
methods of estimating cost or sales impacts also will be performed, as 
needed.
    (g) Cumulative impacts of other Federal regulatory actions. (1) The 
Department will recognize and seek to mitigate the overlapping effects 
on manufacturers of new or revised DOE standards and other regulatory 
actions affecting the same products. DOE will analyze and consider the 
impact on manufacturers of multiple product-specific regulatory actions. 
These factors will be considered in setting rulemaking priorities, 
assessing manufacturer impacts of a particular standard, and 
establishing the effective date for a new or revised standard. In 
particular, DOE will seek to propose effective dates for new or revised 
standards that are appropriately coordinated with other regulatory 
actions to mitigate any cumulative burden.
    (2) If the Department determines that a proposed standard would 
impose a significant impact on product manufacturers within three years 
of the effective date of another DOE standard that imposes significant 
impacts on the same manufacturers (or divisions thereof, as 
appropriate), the Department will, in addition to evaluating the impact 
on manufacturers of the proposed standard, assess the joint impacts of 
both standards on manufacturers.
    (3) If the Department is directed to establish or revise standards 
for products that are components of other products subject to standards, 
the Department will consider the interaction between such standards in 
setting rulemaking priorities and assessing manufacturer impacts of a 
particular standard. The Department will assess, as part of the 
engineering and impact analyses, the cost of components subject to 
efficiency standards.
    (h) Summary of quantitative and qualitative assessments. The summary 
of quantitative and qualitative assessments will contain a description 
and discussion of uncertainties. Alternative estimates of impacts, 
resulting from the different potential scenarios developed throughout 
the analysis, will be explicitly presented in the final analysis 
results.
    (i) Key modeling and analytical tools. In its assessment of the 
likely impacts of standards on manufacturers, the Department will use 
models which are clear and understandable, feature accessible 
calculations, and have assumptions that are clearly explained. As a 
starting point, the Department will use the Government Regulatory Impact 
Model (GRIM). The Department will consider any enhancements to the GRIM 
that are suggested by interested parties. If changes are made to the 
GRIM methodology, DOE will provide notice and seek public input. The 
Department will also support the development of economic models for 
price and volume forecasting. Research required to update key economic 
data will be considered.

         11. Principles for the Analysis of Impacts on Consumers

    (a) Early consideration of impacts on consumer utility. The 
Department will consider at the earliest stages of the development of a 
standard whether particular design options will lessen the utility of 
the covered products to the consumer. See section 4(a).
    (b) Impacts on product availability. The Department will determine, 
based on consideration of information submitted during the standard 
development process, whether a proposed standard is likely to result in 
the unavailability of any covered product type with performance 
characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, 
and volumes that are substantially the same as products generally 
available in the U.S. at the time. DOE will not promulgate a standard if 
it concludes that it would result in such unavailability.
    (c) Department of justice review. As required by law, the Department 
will solicit the views of the Justice Department on any lessening of 
competition that is likely to result from the imposition of a proposed 
standard and will give the views provided full consideration in 
assessing economic justification of a proposed standard. In addition, 
DOE may consult with the Department of Justice at earlier stages in the 
standards development process to seek to obtain preliminary views on 
competitive impacts.
    (d) Variation in consumer impacts. The Department will use regional 
analysis and sensitivity analysis tools, as appropriate, to evaluate the 
potential distribution of impacts of candidate standards levels among 
different subgroups of consumers. The Department will consider impacts 
on significant segments of consumers in determining standards levels. 
Where there are significant negative impacts on identifiable subgroups, 
DOE will consider the efficacy of voluntary approaches as a means to 
achieve potential energy savings.

[[Page 247]]

    (e) Payback period and first cost. (1) In the assessment of consumer 
impacts of standards, the Department will consider Life-Cycle Cost, 
Payback Period and Cost of Conserved Energy to evaluate the savings in 
operating expenses relative to increases in purchase price. The 
Department intends to increase the level of sensitivity analysis and 
scenario analysis for future rulemakings. The results of these analyses 
will be carried throughout the analysis and the ensuing uncertainty 
described.
    (2) If, in the analysis of consumer impacts, the Department 
determines that a candidate standard level would result in a substantial 
increase in the product first costs to consumers or would not pay back 
such additional first costs through energy cost savings in less than 
three years, Department will specifically assess the likely impacts of 
such a standard on low-income households, product sales and fuel 
switching.

             12. Consideration of Non-Regulatory Approaches

    (a) The Department recognizes that voluntary or other non-regulatory 
efforts by manufacturers, utilities and other interested parties can 
result in substantial efficiency improvements. The Department intends to 
consider fully the likely effects of non-regulatory initiatives on 
product energy use, consumer utility and life cycle costs, 
manufacturers, competition, utilities and the environment, as well as 
the distribution of these impacts among different regions, consumers, 
manufacturers and utilities. DOE will attempt to base its assessment on 
the actual impacts of such initiatives to date, but also will consider 
information presented regarding the impacts that any existing initiative 
might have in the future. Such information is likely to include a 
demonstration of the strong commitment of manufacturers, distribution 
channels, utilities or others to such voluntary efficiency improvements. 
This information will be used in assessing the likely incremental 
impacts of establishing or revising standards, in assessing appropriate 
effective dates for new or revised standards and in considering DOE 
support of non-regulatory initiatives.
    (b) DOE believes that non-regulatory approaches are valuable 
complements to the standards program. In particular, DOE will consider 
pursuing voluntary programs where it appears that highly efficient 
products can obtain a significant market share but less efficient 
products cannot be eliminated altogether because, for instance, of 
unacceptable adverse impacts on a significant subgroup of consumers. In 
making this assessment, the Department will consider the success more 
efficient designs have had in the market, their acceptance to date, and 
their potential market penetration.

                 13. Crosscutting Analytical Assumptions

    In selecting values for certain crosscutting analytical assumptions, 
DOE expects to continue relying upon the following sources and general 
principles:
    (a) Underlying economic assumptions. The appliance standards 
analyses will generally use the same economic growth and development 
assumptions that underlie the most current Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) 
published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
    (b) Energy price and demand trends. Analyses of the likely impact of 
appliance standards on typical users will generally adopt the mid-range 
energy price and demand scenario of the EIA's most current AEO. The 
sensitivity of such estimated impacts to possible variations in future 
energy prices are likely to be examined using the EIA's high and low 
energy price scenarios.
    (c) Product-specific energy-efficiency trends, without updated 
standards. Product specific energy-efficiency trends will be based on a 
combination of the efficiency trends forecast by the EIA's residential 
and commercial demand model of the National Energy Modeling System 
(NEMS) and product-specific assessments by DOE and its contractors with 
input from interested parties.
    (d) Discount rates. For residential and commercial consumers, ranges 
of three different real discount rates will be used. For residential 
consumers, the mid-range discount rate will represent DOE's 
approximation of the average financing cost (or opportunity costs of 
reduced savings) experienced by typical consumers. Sensitivity analyses 
will be performed using discount rates reflecting the costs more likely 
to be experienced by residential consumers with little or no savings and 
credit card financing and consumers with substantial savings. For 
commercial users, a mid-range discount rate reflecting the DOE's 
approximation of the average real rate of return on commercial 
investment will be used, with sensitivity analyses being performed using 
values indicative of the range of real rates of return likely to be 
experienced by typical commercial businesses. For national net present 
value calculations, DOE would use the Administration's approximation of 
the average real rate of return on private investment in the U.S. 
economy. For manufacturer impacts, DOE plans to use a range of real 
discount rates which are representative of the real rates of return 
experienced by typical U.S. manufacturers affected by the program.
    (e) Environmental impacts. The emission rates of carbon, sulfur 
oxides and nitrogen oxides used by DOE to calculate the physical 
quantities of emissions likely to be avoided by candidate standard 
levels will be based on the current average carbon emissions of the U.S. 
electric utilities and on the projected

[[Page 248]]

rates of emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides. Projected rates of 
emissions, if available, will be used for the estimation of any other 
environmental impacts. The Department will consider the effects of the 
proposed standards on these emissions in reaching a decision about 
whether the benefits of the proposed standards exceed their burdens but 
will not determine the monetary value of these environmental 
externalities.

             14. Deviations, Revisions, and Judicial Review

    (a) Deviations. This Appendix specifies procedures, interpretations 
and policies for the development of new or revised energy efficiency 
standards in considerable detail. As the approach described in this 
Appendix is applied to the development of particular standards, the 
Department may find it necessary or appropriate to deviate from these 
procedures, interpretations or policies. If the Department concludes 
that such deviations are necessary or appropriate in a particular 
situation, DOE will provide interested parties with notice of the 
deviation and an explanation.
    (b) Revisions. If the Department concludes that changes to the 
procedures, interpretations or policies in this Appendix are necessary 
or appropriate, DOE will provide notice in the Federal Register of 
modifications to this Appendix with an accompanying explanation. DOE 
expects to consult with interested parties prior to any such 
modification.
    (c) Judicial review. The procedures, interpretations, and policies 
stated in this Appendix are not intended to establish any new cause of 
action or right to judicial review.

<R04>
    Subpart D--Petitions To Exempt State Regulation From Preemption; 
           Petitions to Withdraw Exemption of State Regulation

    Source: 54 FR 6078, Feb. 7, 1989, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 430.40  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The regulations in this subpart prescribe the procedures to be 
followed in connection with petitions requesting a rule that a State 
regulation prescribing an energy conservation standard or other 
requirement respecting energy use or energy efficiency of a type (or 
class) of covered product not be preempted.
    (b) The regulations in this subpart also prescribe the procedures to 
be followed in connection with petitions to withdraw a rule exempting a 
State regulation prescribing an energy conservation standard or other 
requirement respecting energy use or energy efficiency of a type (or 
class) of covered product.


<R05>
Sec. 430.41  Prescriptions of a rule.

    (a) Criteria for exemption from preemption. Upon petition by a State 
which has prescribed an energy conservation standard or other 
requirement for a type or class of a covered product for which a Federal 
energy conservation standard is applicable, the Secretary shall 
prescribe a rule that such standard not be preempted if he determines 
that the State has established by a preponderance of the evidence that 
such requirement is needed to meet unusual and compelling State or local 
energy interests. For the purposes of this regulation, the term 
``unusual and compelling State or local energy interests'' means 
interests which are substantially different in nature or magnitude than 
those prevailing in the U.S. generally; and are such that when evaluated 
within the context of the State's energy plan and forecast, the costs, 
benefits, burdens, and reliability of energy savings resulting from the 
State regulation make such regulation preferable or necessary when 
measured against the costs, benefits, burdens, and reliability of 
alternative approaches to energy savings or production, including 
reliance on reasonably predictable market-induced improvements in 
efficiency of all products subject to the State regulation. The 
Secretary may not prescribe such a rule if he finds that interested 
persons have established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the 
State's regulation will significantly burden manufacturing, marketing, 
distribution, sale or servicing of the covered product on a national 
basis. In determining whether to make such a finding, the Secretary 
shall evaluate all relevant factors including: The extent to which the 
State regulation will increase manufacturing or distribution costs of 
manufacturers, distributors, and others; the extent to which the State 
regulation will disadvantage smaller manufacturers, distributors, or 
dealers or lessen competition in the sale of the covered product in the 
State; the extent to which the

[[Page 249]]

State regulation would cause a burden to manufacturers to redesign and 
produce the covered product type (or class), taking into consideration 
the extent to which the regulation would result in a reduction in the 
current models, or in the projected availability of models, that could 
be shipped on the effective date of the regulation to the State and 
within the U.S., or in the current or projected sales volume of the 
covered product type (or class) in the State and the U.S.; and the 
extent to which the State regulation is likely to contribute 
significantly to a proliferation of State appliance efficiency 
requirements and the cumulative impact such requirements would have. The 
Secretary may not prescribe such a rule if he finds that such a rule 
will result in the unavailability in the State of any covered product 
(or class) of performance characteristics (including reliability), 
features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same 
as those generally available in the State at the time of the Secretary's 
finding. The failure of some classes (or types) to meet this criterion 
shall not affect the Secretary's determination of whether to prescribe a 
rule for other classes (or types).
    (1) Requirements of petition for exemption from preemption. A 
petition from a State for a rule for exemption from preemption shall 
include the information listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through 
(a)(1)(viii) of this section. A petition for a rule and correspondence 
relating to such petition shall be available for public review except 
for confidential or proprietary information submitted in accordance with 
the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information Regulations set forth 
in 10 CFR part 1004:
    (i) The name, address and telephone number of the petitioner;
    (ii) A copy of the State standard for which a rule exempting such 
standard is sought;
    (iii) A copy of the State's energy plan and forecast;
    (iv) Specification of each type or class of covered product for 
which a rule exempting a standard is sought;
    (v) Other information, if any, believed to be pertinent by the 
petitioner; and
    (vi) Such other information as the Secretary may require.
    (b) Criteria for exemption from preemption when energy emergency 
conditions exist within State. Upon petition by a State which has 
prescribed an energy conservation standard or other requirement for a 
type or class of a covered product for which a Federal energy 
conservation standard is applicable, the Secretary may prescribe a rule, 
effective upon publication in the Federal Register, that such regulation 
not be preempted if he determines that in addition to meeting the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section the State has established 
that: an energy emergency condition exists within the State that 
imperils the health, safety and welfare of its residents because of the 
inability of the State or utilities within the State to provide adequate 
quantities of gas or electric energy to its residents at less than 
prohibitive costs; and cannot be substantially alleviated by the 
importation of energy or the use of interconnection agreements; and the 
State regulation is necessary to alleviate substantially such condition.
    (1) Requirements of petition for exemption from preemption when 
energy emergency conditions exist within a State. A petition from a 
State for a rule for exemption from preemption when energy emergency 
conditions exist within a State shall include the information listed in 
paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(vi) of this section. A petition 
shall also include the information prescribed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) 
through (b)(1)(iv) of this section, and shall be available for public 
review except for confidential or proprietary information submitted in 
accordance with the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information 
Regulations set forth in 10 CFR part 1004:
    (i) A description of the energy emergency condition which exists 
within the State, including causes and impacts.
    (ii) A description of emergency response actions taken by the State 
and utilities within the State to alleviate the emergency condition;

[[Page 250]]

    (iii) An analysis of why the emergency condition cannot be 
alleviated substantially by importation of energy or the use of 
interconnection agreements;
    (iv) An analysis of how the State standard can alleviate 
substantially such emergency condition.
    (c) Criteria for withdrawal of a rule exempting a State standard. 
Any person subject to a State standard which, by rule, has been exempted 
from Federal preemption and which prescribes an energy conservation 
standard or other requirement for a type or class of a covered product, 
when the Federal energy conservation standard for such product 
subsequently is amended, may petition the Secretary requesting that the 
exemption rule be withdrawn. The Secretary shall consider such petition 
in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, 
except that the burden shall be on the petitioner to demonstrate that 
the exemption rule received by the State should be withdrawn as a result 
of the amendment to the Federal standard. The Secretary shall withdraw 
such rule if he determines that the petitioner has shown the rule should 
be withdrawn.
    (1) Requirements of petition to withdraw a rule exempting a State 
standard. A petition for a rule to withdraw a rule exempting a State 
standard shall include the information prescribed in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(vii) of this section, and shall be available 
for public review, except for confidential or proprietary information 
submitted in accordance with the Department of Energy's Freedom of 
Information Regulations set forth in 10 CFR part 1004:
    (i) The name, address and telephone number of the petitioner;
    (ii) A statement of the interest of the petitioner for which a rule 
withdrawing an exemption is sought;
    (iii) A copy of the State standard for which a rule withdrawing an 
exemption is sought;
    (iv) Specification of each type or class of covered product for 
which a rule withdrawing an exemption is sought;
    (v) A discussion of the factors contained in paragraph (a) of this 
section;
    (vi) Such other information, if any, believed to be pertinent by the 
petitioner; and
    (vii) Such other information as the Secretary may require.

    (b) In accordance with section 333 of the Act, any person who 
knowingly violates any provision of paragraph (a) of this section may be 
subject to assessment of a civil penalty of no more than $100 for each 
violation. Each violation of paragraph (a) of this section shall 
constitute a separate violation with respect to each covered product, 
and each day of noncompliance with paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) of 
this section shall constitute a separate violation.


<R05>
Sec. 430.62  Submission of data.

    (a) Compliance statement and certification report. Each manufacturer 
or private labeler before distributing in commerce any basic model of a 
covered product subject to the applicable energy conservation standard 
set forth in subpart C of this part shall certify by means of a 
statement of compliance and certification report, that each basic model 
meets the requirements of that standard.
    (1) The compliance statement shall certify that:
    (i) The basic model(s) comply with the applicable energy 
conservation standards;
    (ii) All required testing on which the compliance statement is based 
was conducted in conformance with the applicable test requirements 
prescribed in 10 CFR Part 430 Subpart B and this subpart and all test 
data are reported in accordance with this subpart;
    (iii) All information reported in the compliance statement is true, 
accurate, and complete; and
    (iv) The manufacturer (private labeler) is aware of the penalties 
associated with violations of the Act and the regulations thereunder, 
and 18 U.S.C. 1001 which prohibits knowingly making false statements to 
the Federal Government. The format for a compliance statement is set 
forth in appendix A of this subpart.
    (2) For each basic model the certification report shall include the 
annual energy use and adjusted volume (for refrigerators, refrigerator-
freezers and

[[Page 255]]

freezers), energy factor and rated storage volume (for water heaters), 
the energy efficiency ratio (for room air conditioners), seasonal energy 
efficiency ratio and heating seasonal performance factor (for central 
air conditioners and central air conditioning heat pumps), thermal 
efficiency (for pool heaters), and annual fuel utilization efficiency 
(for furnaces and direct heating equipment) the model numbers for each 
basic model; and its capacity. For each basic model of general service 
fluorescent and incandescent reflector lamps, the certification report 
shall include the laboratory's NVLAP identification number or other 
NVLAP-approved accreditation identification, basic model tested, 
production date codes (and accompanying decoding scheme), the 12-month 
average lamp efficacy and lamp wattage, brand names and model 
designation. The certification report shall also include the 12-month 
average Color Rendering Index for general service fluorescent lamps.
    (3) Copies of reports to the Federal Trade Commission which include 
the information in paragraph (a)(2) of this section meet the 
requirements of this paragraph.
    (b) Initial reporting requirements. All data required by paragraph 
(a) of this section shall be submitted on or before the effective date 
of the applicable energy conservation standard as prescribed in section

    (c) New models. All information required by paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section must be submitted for new models prior to or concurrent with any 
distribution of such model. Any change to a basic model which affects 
energy consumption may constitute the addition of a new basic model 
subject to the requirements of Sec. 430.61 of this part. If such change 
does not alter compliance with the applicable energy conservation 
standard for the basic model, the new model shall be considered 
certified. Models which are discontinued shall be reported, in writing, 
to the Department of Energy.
    (d) Maintenance of records. (1) The manufacturer of any covered 
product subject to any of the energy performance standards or procedures 
prescribed in this part, shall establish, maintain, and retain the 
records of the underlying test data for all certification testing. Such 
records shall be organized and indexed in a fashion which makes them 
readily accessible for review. The records should include the supporting 
test data associated with tests performed on any test units to satisfy 
the requirements of this subpart (except tests performed by DOE 
directly).
    (2) All such records shall be retained by the manufacturer for a 
period of two years from the date that production of the applicable 
model has ceased. Records shall be retained in a form allowing ready 
access to DOE upon request.
    (e) Third party representation. If a manufacturer or private labeler 
elects to use a third party, e.g., trade association or other authorized 
representative, to submit the certification report, the certification 
report shall include all the information identified in paragraph (a) of 
this section, including the compliance statement.

<R05>
Sec. 430.63  Sampling.

    (a) For purposes of a certification of compliance, the determination 
that a basic model complies with the applicable energy performance 
standard shall be based upon the sampling procedures set forth in 
Sec. 430.23 of this part. For purposes of a certification of compliance, 
the determination that a basic model complies with the applicable design 
standard shall be based upon the incorporation of specific design 
requirements for clothes dryers, dishwashers, clothes washers and 
kitchen ranges and ovens specified in section 325 of the Act.
    (b) A basic model which meets the following requirements may qualify 
as

[[Page 256]]

an ``other than tested model'' for purposes of the certification testing 
and sampling requirements:
    (1) Central air conditioners: The condenser-evaporator coil 
combinations manufactured by the condensing unit manufacturer other than 
the combination likely to have the largest volume of retail sales or the 
condenser-coil combinations manufactured in part by a component 
manufacturer using the same condensing unit.
    (2) For purposes of certification of ``other than tested models,'' 
as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a manufacturer may 
certify the basic model on the basis of computer simulation or 
engineering analysis as set forth in Sec. 430.23(m) of this part.

particular covered product sold by a particular manufacturer or private 
labeler which indicates that the covered product may not be in 
compliance with the applicable energy performance standard, the 
Secretary may conduct testing of that covered product under this subpart 
by means of a test notice addressed to the manufacturer in accordance 
with the following requirements:
    (i) Such a procedure will only be followed after the Secretary or 
his designated representative has examined the underlying test data 
provided by the manufacturer and after the manufacturer has been offered 
the opportunity to meet with DOE to verify compliance with the 
applicable performance standard. A representative designated by the 
Secretary shall be permitted to observe any reverification procedures by 
this subpart, and to inspect the results of such reverification.
    (ii) The test notice will be signed by the Secretary or his 
designee. The test notice will be mailed or delivered by DOE to the 
plant manager or other responsible official, as designated by the 
manufacturer.
    (iii) The test notice will specify the model or basic model to be 
selected for testing, the method of selecting the test sample, the time 
at which testing shall be initiated, the date by which testing is 
scheduled to be completed and the facility at which testing will be 
conducted. The test notice may also provide for situations in which the 
selected basic model is unavailable for testing, and may include 
alternative basic models.
    (iv) The Secretary may require in the test notice that the 
manufacturer of a covered product shall ship at his expense a reasonable 
number of units of a basic model specified in such test notice to a 
testing laboratory designated by the Secretary. The number of units of a 
basic model specified in a test notice shall not exceed twenty (20).
    (v) Within 5 working days of the time units are selected, the 
manufacturer shall ship the specified test units of a basic model to the 
testing laboratory.

[[Page 257]]

    (2) Testing Laboratory. Whenever DOE conducts enforcement testing at 
a designated laboratory in accordance with a test notice under this 
section, the resulting test data shall constitute official test data for 
that basic model. Such test data will be used by DOE to make a 
determination of compliance or noncompliance if a sufficient number of 
tests have been conducted to satisfy the requirements of appendix B of 
this subpart.
    (3) Sampling. The determination that a manufacturer's basic model 
complies with the applicable energy performance standard shall be based 
on the testing conducted in accordance with the statistical sampling 
procedures set forth in appendix B of this subpart and the test 
procedures set forth in subpart B of this part.
    (4) Test unit selection. A DOE inspector shall select a batch, a 
batch sample, and test units from the batch sample in accordance with 
the provisions of this paragraph and the conditions specified in the 
test notice.
    (i) The batch may be subdivided by DOE utilizing criteria specified 
in the test notice, e.g., date of manufacture, component-supplier, 
location of manufacturing facility, or other criteria which may 
differentiate one unit from another within a basic model.
    (ii) A batch sample of up to 20 units will then be randomly selected 
from one or more subdivided groups within the batch. The manufacturer 
shall keep on hand all units in the batch sample until such time as the 
basic model is determined to be in compliance or noncompliance.
    (iii) Individual test units comprising the test sample shall be 
randomly selected from the batch sample.
    (iv) All random selection shall be achieved by sequentially 
numbering all of the units in a batch sample and then using a table of 
random numbers to select the units to be tested.
    (5) Test unit preparation. (i) Prior to and during testing, a test 
unit selected in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section shall 
not be prepared, modified, or adjusted in any manner unless such 
preparation, modification, or adjustment is allowed by the applicable 
DOE test procedure. One test shall be conducted for each test unit in 
accordance with the applicable test procedures prescribed in subpart B.
    (ii) No quality control, testing or assembly procedures shall be 
performed on a test unit, or any parts and subassemblies thereof, that 
is not performed during the production and assembly of all other units 
included in the basic model.
    (iii) A test unit shall be considered defective if such unit is 
inoperative or is found to be in noncompliance due to failure of the 
unit to operate according to the manufacturer's design and operating 
instructions. Defective units, including those damaged due to shipping 
or handling, shall be reported immediately to DOE. DOE shall authorize 
testing of an additional unit on a case-by-case basis.
    (6) Testing at manufacturer's option. (i) If a manufacturer's basic 
model is determined to be in noncompliance with the applicable energy 
performance standard at the conclusion of DOE testing in accordance with 
the double sampling plan specified in appendix B of this subpart, the 
manufacturer may request that DOE conduct additional testing of the 
model according to procedures set forth in appendix B of this subpart.
    (ii) All units tested under paragraph (a)(6) of this section shall 
be selected and tested in accordance with the provisions given in 
paragraphs (a) (1) through (5) of this section.
    (iii) The manufacturer shall bear the cost of all testing conducted 
under paragraph (a)(6) of this section.
    (iv) The manufacturer shall cease distribution of the basic model 
being tested under the provisions of paragraph (a)(6) of this section 
from the time the manufacturer elects to exercise the option provided in 
this paragraph until the basic model is determined to be in compliance. 
DOE may seek civil penalties for all units distributed during such 
period.
    (v) If the additional testing results in a determination of 
compliance, a notice of allowance to resume distribution shall be issued 
by the Department.
    (b) Design standard. In the case of a design standard, a model is 
determined noncompliant by DOE after the Secretary or his designated 
representative

[[Page 258]]

has examined the underlying design information provided by the 
manufacturer and after the manufacturer has been offered the opportunity 
to verify compliance with the applicable design standard.


<R05>
Sec. 430.71  Cessation of distribution of a basic model.

    (a) In the event that a model is determined noncompliant by DOE in 
accordance with Sec. 430.70 of this part or if a manufacturer or private 
labeler determines a model to be in noncompliance, then the manufacturer 
or private labeler shall:
    (1) Immediately cease distribution in commerce of the basic model;
    (2) Give immediate written notification of the determination of 
noncompliance, to all persons to whom the manufacturer has distributed 
units of the basic model manufactured since the date of the last 
determination of compliance.
    (3) Pursuant to a request made by the Secretary, provide DOE within 
30 days of the request, records, reports and other documentation 
pertaining to the acquisition, ordering, storage, shipment, or sale of a 
basic model determined to be in noncompliance.
    (4) The manufacturer may modify the noncompliant basic model in such 
manner as to make it comply with the applicable performance standard. 
Such modified basic model shall then be treated as a new basic model and 
must be certified in accordance with the provisions of this subpart; 
except that in addition satisfying all requirements of this subpart, the 
manufacturer shall also maintain records that demonstrate that 
modifications have been made to all units of the new basic model prior 
to distribution in commerce.
    (b) If a basic model is not properly certified in accordance with 
the requirements of this subpart, the Secretary may seek, among other 
remedies, injunctive action to prohibit distribution in commerce of such 
basic model.


<R05>
Sec. 430.72  Subpoena.

    Pursuant to section 329(a) of the Act, for purposes of carrying out 
this part, the Secretary or the Secretary's designee, may sign and issue 
subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the 
production of relevant books, records, papers, and other documents, and 
administer the oaths. Witnesses summoned under the provisions of this 
section shall be paid the same fees and mileage as are paid to witnesses 
in the courts of the United States. In case of contumacy by, or refusal 
to obey a subpoena served, upon any persons subject to this part, the 
Secretary may seek an order from the District Court of the United States 
for any District in which such person is found or resides or transacts 
business requiring such person to appear and give testimony, or to 
appear and produce documents. Failure to obey such order is punishable 
by such court as a contempt thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 430.73  Remedies.

    If DOE determines that a basic model of a covered product does not 
comply with an applicable energy conservation standard:
    (a) DOE will notify the manufacturer, private labeler or any other 
person as required, of this finding and of the Secretary's intent to 
seek a judicial order restraining further distribution in commerce of 
such basic model unless the manufacturer, private labeler or any other 
person as required, delivers to DOE within 15 calendar days a statement, 
satisfactory to DOE, of the steps he will take to insure that the 
noncompliant model will no longer be distributed in commerce. DOE will 
monitor the implementation of such statement.
    (b) If the manufacturer, private labeler or any other person as 
required, fails to stop distribution of the noncompliant model, the 
Secretary may seek to restrain such violation in accordance with section 
334 of the Act.
    (c) The Secretary shall determine whether the facts of the case 
warrant the assessment of civil penalties for knowing violations in 
accordance with section 333 of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 430.74  Hearings and appeals.

    (a) Pursuant to section 333(d) of the Act, before issuing an order 
assessing a civil penalty against any person under

[[Page 259]]

this section, the Secretary shall provide to such person notice of the

opportunity to elect in writing within 30 days after the date of receipt 
of such notice to have the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section 
(in lieu of those in paragraph (b) of this section) apply with respect 
to such assessment.
    (b)(1) Unless an election is made within 30 calendar days after 
receipt of notice under paragraph (a) of this section to have paragraph 
(c) of this section apply with respect to such penalty, the Secretary 
shall assess the penalty, by order, after a determination of violation 
has been made on the record after an opportunity for an agency hearing 
pursuant to section 554 of title 5, United States Code, before an 
administrative law judge appointed under section 3105 of such title 5. 
Such assessment order shall include the administrative law judge's 
findings and the basis for such assessment.
    (2) Any person against whom a penalty is assessed under this section 
may, within 60 calendar days after the date of the order of the 
Secretary assessing such penalty, institute an action in the United 
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate judicial circuit for 
judicial review of such order in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5, 
United States Code. The court shall have jurisdiction to enter a 
judgment affirming, modifying, or setting aside in whole or in part, the 
order of the Secretary, or the court may remand the proceeding to the 
Secretary for such further action as the court may direct.
    (c)(1) In the case of any civil penalty with respect to which the 
procedures of this section have been elected, the Secretary shall 
promptly assess such penalty, by order, after the date of the receipt of 
the notice under paragraph (a) of this section of the proposed penalty.
    (2) If the civil penalty has not been paid within 60 calendar days 
after the assessment has been made under paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, the Secretary shall institute an action in the appropriate 
District Court of the United States for an order affirming the 
assessment of the civil penalty. The court shall have authority to 
review de novo the law and the facts involved and shall have 
jurisdiction to enter a judgment enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as 
so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part, such assessment.
    (3) Any election to have this paragraph apply may not be revoked 
except with the consent of the Secretary.
    (d) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty 
after it has become a final and unappealable order under paragraph (b) 
of this section, or after the appropriate District Court has entered 
final judgment in favor of the Secretary under paragraph (c) of this 
section, the Secretary shall institute an action to recover the amount 
of such penalty in any appropriate District Court of the United States. 
In such action, the validity and appropriateness of such final 
assessment order or judgment shall not be subject to review.
    (e)(1) In accordance with the provisions of section 333(d)(5)(A) of

   Appendix B to Subpart F of Part 430--Sampling Plan for Enforcement 
                                 Testing

                             Double Sampling

    Step 1. The first sample size (n<INF>1</INF>) must be four or more 
units.
    Step 2. Compute the mean (x<INF>1</INF>) of the measured energy 
performance of the n<INF>1</INF> units in the first sample as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.071

where x<INF>i</INF> is the measured energy efficiency or energy 
consumption of unit i.
    Step 3. Compute the standard deviation (s<INF>1</INF>) of the 
measured energy performance of the n<INF>1</INF> units in the first 
sample as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.072

    Step 4. Compute the standard error (s-<INF>x</INF> cents) of the 
measured energy performance of the n<INF>1</INF> units in the first 
sample as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.073

    Step 5. Compute the upper control limit (UCL<INF>1</INF>) and lower 
control limit (LCL<INF>1</INF>) for the mean of the first sample using 
the applicable DOE energy performance standard (EPS) as the desired mean 
and a probability level of 95 percent (two-tailed test) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.074

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.075

where t is a statistic based on a 95 percent two-tailed probability 
level and a sample size of n<INF>1</INF>.
    Step 6A. For an Energy Efficiency Standard, compare the mean of the 
first sample (x<INF>1</INF>) with the upper and lower control limits 
(UCL<INF>1</INF> and LCL<INF>1</INF>) to determine one of the following:

[[Page 261]]

    (i) If the mean of the first sample is below the lower control 
limit, then the basic model is in noncompliance and testing is at an 
end. (Do not go on to any of the steps below.)
    (ii) If the mean of the first sample is equal to or greater than the 
upper control limit, then the basic model is in compliance and testing 
is at an end. (Do not go on to any of the steps below.)
    (iii) If the sample mean is equal to or greater than the lower 
control limit but less than the upper control limit, then no 
determination of compliance or noncompliance can be made and a second 
sample size is determined by Step 7a.
    Step 6b. For an Energy Consumption Standard, compare the mean of the 
first sample (x<INF>1</INF>) with the upper and lower control limits 
(UCL<INF>1</INF> and LCL<INF>1</INF>) to determine one of the following:
    (i) If the mean of the first sample is above the upper control 
limit, then the basic model is in noncompliance and testing is at an 
end. (Do not go on to any of the steps below.)
    (ii) If the mean of the first sample is equal to or less than the 
lower control limit, then the basic model is in compliance and testing 
is at an end. (Do not go on to any of the steps below.)
    (iii) If the sample mean is equal to or less than the upper control 
limit but greater than the lower control limit, then no determination of 
compliance or noncompliance can be made and a second sample size is 
determined by Step 7b.
    Step 7a. For an Energy Efficiency Standard, determine the second 
sample size (n<INF>2</INF>) as follows:

                                                                                                                
                                                          t s<INF>1                                                  
                                     n<INF>2=  <5-line (> ------------- <5-ln )><SUP>2  -n<INF>1                           (6a)
                                                        0.05 EPS                                                
                                                                                                                

where s<INF>1</INF> and t have the values used in Steps 4 and 5, 
respectively. The term ``0.05 EPS'' is the difference between the 
applicable energy efficiency standard and 95 percent of the standard, 
where 95 percent of the standard is taken as the lower control limit. 
This procedure yields a sufficient combined sample size 
(n<INF>1</INF>+n<INF>2</INF>) to give an estimated 97.5 percent 
probability of obtaining a determination of compliance when the true 
mean efficiency is equal to the applicable standard.
    Given the solution value of n<INF>2</INF>, determine one of the 
following:
    (1) If the value of n<INF>2</INF> is less than or equal to zero and 
if the mean energy efficiency of the first sample (x<INF>1</INF>) is 
either equal to or greater than the lower control limit 
(LCL<INF>1</INF>) or equal to or greater than 95 percent of the 
applicable energy efficiency standard (EES), whichever is greater, i.e., 
if

n<INF>2</INF> <ls-thn-eq> 0 and x<INF>1</INF> <gr-thn-eq> 
          max(LCL<INF>1</INF>, 0.95 EES),

the basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end.
    (2) If the value of n<INF>2</INF> is less than or equal to zero and 
the mean energy efficiency of the first sample (x<INF>1</INF>) is less 
than the lower control limit (LCL<INF>1</INF>) or less than 95 percent 
of the applicable energy efficiency standard (EES), whichever is 
greater, i.e., if

n<INF>2</INF> <ls-thn-eq> 0 and x<INF>1</INF> < max(LCL<INF>1</INF>, 
          0.95 EES),

the basic model is in noncompliance and testing is at an end.
    (3) If the value of n<INF>2</INF> is greater than zero, then value 
of the second sample size is determined to be the smallest integer equal 
to or greater than the solution value of n<INF>2</INF> for equation 
(6a). If the value of n<INF>2</INF> so calculated is greater than 20-
n<INF>1</INF>, set n<INF>2</INF> equal to 20-n<INF>1</INF>.
    Step 7b. For an Energy Consumption Standard, determine the second 
sample size (n<INF>2</INF>) as follows:

                                                                                                                
                                                          t s<INF>1                                                  
                                     n<INF>2=  <5-line (> ------------- <5-ln )><SUP>2  -n<INF>1                           (6b)
                                                        0.05 EPS                                                
                                                                                                                

where s<INF>1</INF> and t have the values used in Steps 4 and 5, 
respectively. The term ``0.05 EPS'' is the difference between the 
applicable energy consumption standard and 105 percent of the standard, 
where 105 percent of the standard is taken as the upper control limit. 
This procedure yields a sufficient combined sample size (n<INF>1</INF> + 
n<INF>2</INF>) to give an estimated 97.5 percent probability of 
obtaining a determination of compliance when the true mean consumption 
is equal to the applicable standard.
    Given the solution value of n<INF>2</INF>, determine one of the 
following:
    (1) If the value of n<INF>2</INF> is less than or equal to zero and 
if the mean energy consumption of the first sample (x<INF>1</INF>) is 
either equal to or less than the upper control limit (UCL<INF>1</INF>) 
or equal to or less than 105 percent of the applicable energy 
performance standard (EPS), whichever is less, i.e., if

n<INF>2</INF> <ls-thn-eq> 0 and x<INF>1</INF> <gr-thn-eq> 
          min(UCL<INF>1</INF>, 1.05 EPS),

the basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end.
    (2) If the value of n<INF>2</INF> is less than or equal to zero and 
the mean energy consumption of the first sample (x<INF>1</INF>) is 
greater than the upper control limit (UCL<INF>1</INF>) or more than 105 
percent of the applicable energy performance standard (EPS), whichever 
is less, i.e., if

n<INF>2</INF> <ls-thn-eq> 0 and x<INF>1</INF>  <gr-thn-eq>  
          min(LCL<INF>1</INF>, 1.05 EPS),

the basic model is in noncompliance and testing is at an end.
    (3) If the value of n<INF>2</INF> is greater than zero, then the 
value of the second sample size is determined to be the smallest integer 
equal to or greater than the solution value of n<INF>2</INF> for 
equation (6b). If the value of n<INF>2</INF> so calculated is greater 
than 20-n<INF>1</INF>, set n<INF>2</INF> equal to 20-n<INF>1</INF>.
    Step 8. Compute the combined mean (x<INF>2</INF>) of the measured 
energy performance of the n<INF>1</INF> and n<INF>2</INF> units of the 
combined first and second samples as follows:

[[Page 262]]

    Step 9. Compute the standard error 
(s<INF>x</INF<ls-thn-eq><INF>2</INF>) of the measured energy performance 
of the n<INF>1</INF> and n<INF>2</INF> units in the combined first and

Sec. 435.100  Explanation of numbering system for standards.

    (a) For purposes of this subpart, a derivative of two different 
numbering systems will be used.
    (1) For the purpose of designating a section, the system employed in 
the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) will be employed. The number 
``435,'' which signifies Part 435, Chapter II of Title 10, Code of 
Federal Regulations, is used as a prefix for all section headings. The 
suffix is a two or three digit number beginning with ``.97.'' For 
example, the lighting section of the standards is numbered Sec. 435.103.
    (2) Within each section, a numbering system common to many national 
voluntary consensus standards is used. This system was chosen because of 
its commonality among the buildings industry. A decimal system is used 
to denote sections and subsections. For example, Sec. 9.4.2 refers to 
section 9, subsection 4, paragraph 2.
    (b) The hybrid numbering system is used for two purposes:
    (1) The use of the Code of Federal Regulation's numbering system 
allows the researcher using the CFR easy access to the standards.
    (2) The use of the second system allows the builder, designer, 
architect or engineer easy access because they are used to the system 
employed.
    (c) To avoid confusion in the use of the two systems, Sec. 435.101 
through Sec. 435.112, the substantive technical sections of the 
standards, have been numbered so that the last two digits in the suffix 
designate the section. For example, once the reader enters the body of 
Sec. 435.105: Building Envelope, the number ``5'' is used to designate 
the section. References throughout the standard do not employ the 
``435'' prefix but rather refer to the section by the single or double 
digit numbers from 1-12.

Sec. 435.101  Implementation and compliance procedures for Federal agencies.

    Alternative methods of achieving compliance are illustrated in 
Figure 1.1-1.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.080



[[Page 275]]

                             1.1  Compliance

    1.1.1  The head of each Federal agency responsible for the 
construction of Federal buildings shall adopt such procedures as may be 
necessary to assure that the design of the building shall:
    1.1.1.1  be undertaken in a manner that provides for appropriate 
consideration of the Principles of Effective Energy Building Design 
prescribed in Secs. 2.0, 3.2, 4.2, 5.2, 6.2, 7.2, 8.2, 9.2 and 10.2;
    1.1.1.2  comply with the minimum requirements of Secs. 3.3, 4.3, 
5.3, 6.3, 7.3, 8.3, 9.3 and 10.3; and
    1.1.1.3  meet or exceed, based upon the analysis of life-cycle cost-
effectiveness required by Sec. 1.1.2 below, the following additional 
requirements:
    1.1.1.3.1  the lighting design shall meet either the prescriptive 
requirements of Sec. 3.4 or the system performance requirements of 
Sec. 3.5,
    1.1.1.3.2  the building envelope design shall meet either the 
prescriptive requirements of section 5.4 or the system performance 
requirements of section 5.5, and
    1.1.1.3.3  the heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems 
design shall meet the prescriptive requirements of section 7.4, and
    1.1.1.3.4  the service water heating systems design shall meet the 
prescriptive requirements of section 9.4.
    1.1.2  In lieu of meeting the provisions of section 1.1.1 above, the 
building design shall meet the criteria of the building energy method of 
section 11.0 or 12.0, Building Energy Compliance Alternatives I and II.
    1.1.3  The head of each Federal agency responsible for the 
construction of Federal buildings shall also assure that the decision-
making process for the design of the building shall employ the 
methodology for estimating and comparing the life-cycle cost of Federal 
buildings and for determining life-cycle cost-effectiveness prescribed 
in subpart A of 10 C.F.R. part 436.

                   1.2  General Approach to Compliance

    1.2.1  The standards, in addition to minimum requirements, establish 
three alternate methods to determine whether the design has achieved 
compliance.
    1.2.2  There are several alternative methods of achieving compliance 
provided for in the standards:
    1.2.2.1  Prescriptive (Sections 3.4, 5.4, 7.4 and 9.4),
    1.2.2.2  System Performance (Sections 3.5 and 5.5), or
    1.2.2.3  Building Energy (Section 11.0 or 12.0).
    1.2.2.4  The criteria established for each of the methods allow for 
designs that are roughly equivalent in terms of energy conservation. The 
equivalency of the methods can be demonstrated by designing a building 
using the Prescriptive approach, then modeling the building using either 
the System Performance or Building Energy criteria calculation 
procedures and comparing results.
    1.2.3  Compliance with these standards shall be demonstrated by 
meeting the set of minimum requirements defined in Sections 3.2, 3.3, 
4.2, 4.3, 5.2, 5.3, 6.2, 6.3, 7.2, 7.3, 8.2, 8.3, 9.2, 9.3, 10.2, and 
10.3 and one of the alternative methods.

                 1.3  How To Select a Compliance Method

    1.3.1  Use the Prescriptive method when the minimum amount of 
calculation and effort to achieve compliance is of primary concern. Its 
requirements can be readily specified in construction documents and are 
easily reviewed by building code enforcement authorities. The 
Prescriptive method permits few trade-offs or optimization procedures, 
but does permit several energy-effective and cost-effective alternate 
construction options to be used. See Figure 1.1-2.
    1.3.2  Use the System Performance method when more innovative design 
is required, or when the Prescriptive method does not provide the 
necessary design flexibility. It requires more manual calculations than 
the Prescriptive method. See Figure 1.1-2
    1.3.3  Use either of the Building Energy methods (Sections 11.0 or 
12.0) when the most innovative design concepts are being considered. The 
Building Energy methods allow the trade-off of energy among the building 
systems as long as the total calculated design annual energy consumption 
does not exceed the limit prescribed. It will, in general, require the 
use of a computer

[[Page 276]]

program to simulate the operation of the various systems and to model 
building design energy use in accordance with the building loads and the 
proposed schedules of operation. See Figures 11-1 and 12-1.

Sec. 435.102  Principles of effective energy building design.

                              2.1  General

    2.1.1  This section complements the other sections of the standards 
by providing general principles of effective building design. The 
intention of this section is to provide ideas on how to improve the 
integration of the building's major energy using subsystems in a cost-
effective manner without compromising the building's intended functional 
use or internal environmental conditions. In addition, more narrowly 
focused principles are included in sections 3.0 through 10.0.
    2.1.2  To comply with the principles of effective design, designers 
shall use their professional judgment to identify the building's most 
significant energy requirements and select appropriate solutions from 
the general strategies found in this section and the more specific 
strategies found in sections 3.0 through 10.0.

         2.2  Identification of Significant Energy Requirements

    2.2.1  Before energy design strategies can be developed for a 
commercial or multi-family high rise residential building, a clear 
picture of its most significant energy requirements must be developed. 
The basic approach to achieving an energy conscious design is to improve 
the energy efficiency of the building by shifting or reducing loads, 
improving transport systems, and providing efficient environmental 
systems and controls. This is accomplished by first determining which 
aspects of the building's energy requirements are the most significant, 
those that would result in the largest annual energy costs to the 
building owner if energy conserving strategies were otherwise not 
applied. For example, for a given building, the largest annual energy 
cost component may be lighting, followed by cooling, heating, and 
ventilation, respectively. In this example electricity would be the 
major energy source. Therefore, peak time-rates of energy use (i.e., 
peak power demands), as well as direct energy use, would have to be 
included in any energy analysis. Consideration of peak demands will 
reduce the requirement for oversizing of energy systems in the building 
and will also have the added impact of helping to reduce the need for 
additional, low utilization peak capacity on utility grids.
    2.2.2  Once the most significant cost components of the building's 
energy requirements have been determined, apply the strategies and 
design solutions listed below and those that appear in each of the 
following sections of the standards. ln the example noted above, 
lighting solutions would be addressed first, followed by cooling, 
heating, and then ventilation.
    2.2.3  Research results indicate that the most significant energy 
uses for any given commercial or multi-family high rise residential 
building are generally not accurately identifiable by professional 
intuition. Therefore, use shall be made of one of the several available 
analysis tools, some of which are microcomputer-based.

                    2.3  General Solution Strategies

    2.3.1  Consider energy efficiency from the initiation of the 
building design process, since design improvements are most easily and 
effectively made at that time. Seek the active participation of members 
of the design team early in the design process, including the owner, 
architect, engineer, and builder, if possible. Consider building 
attributes such as building function, form, orientation, window/wall 
ratio, and HVAC system types early in the design process. Each has major 
energy implications. These considerations most likely will result in 
solutions that minimize both construction and operation costs, including 
energy demand charges.
    2.3.2  Address the building's energy requirements in the following 
sequence: minimize impact of the building functional requirements; 
minimize loads; improve the efficiency of distribution and conversion 
systems; and integrate building subsystems into an efficient whole. Each 
of these is discussed below.
    2.3.2.1  Minimize impact of functional requirements by identifying 
major areas that offer energy efficiency opportunities based on the

[[Page 279]]

building's functional use, human occupancy requirements, and site 
characteristics. These areas will vary considerably from building to 
building depending upon function and service requirements, and shall be 
considered when applying the criteria of these standards.
    2.3.2.2  Minimize loads by analyzing the external and internal loads 
to be imposed on building energy-using subsystems, both for peak-load 
and part-load conditions. Include a determination of how the building 
relates to its external environment in the analysis, either adaptively 
or defensively. Consider changes in building form, aspect ratio, and 
other attributes that reduce, redistribute, or delay (shift) loads.
    2.3.2.3  Improve subsystems by analyzing the diversified energy and 
demand (power) requirements of each energy-using subsystem serving the 
functional requirements of the building. Consider static and dynamic 
efficiency of energy conversion and energy transport subsystems and 
include consideration of opportunities to reclaim, redistribute and 
store energy for later use.
    2.3.2.4  Alternative ways to integrate systems into the building 
will be accomplished by considering both power and time components of 
energy use. Identify, evaluate, and design each of these components to 
control the overall design energy consumption. The following shall be 
considered when integrating major building subsystems:
    2.3.2.4.1  Address more than one problem when developing design 
solutions, and make maximum use of building components already present 
for non-energy reasons (e.g., windows, structural mass);
    2.3.2.4.2  Examine design solutions that consider time since 
sufficient energy may already be present from the environment (e.g., 
solar heat, night cooling) or from internal equipment (e.g., lights, 
computers) but available at different times than needed. Thus, active 
(heat pumps with water tanks) and passive (building mass) storage 
techniques may be considered;
    2.3.2.4.3  Examine design solutions that consider anticipated space 
utilization. For example, in large but relatively unoccupied spaces, 
task or zone heating may be considered. Transporting energy (light and 
heat) from locations of production and availability to locations of need 
shall be considered instead of the purchase of additional energy;
    2.3.2.4.4  Never reject waste energy at temperatures usable for 
space conditioning or other practical purposes, without calculating the 
economic benefit of energy recovery;
    2.3.2.4.5  Consider design solutions that provide more comfortable 
surface temperatures or increase availability of controlled daylight in 
buildings in which human occupancy is a primary function;
    2.3.2.4.6  Use design solutions that are easily understood as they 
have a greater probability of use by building occupants; and
    2.3.2.4.7  Where the functional requirements of the building may 
change, the installed environmental system should be designed to be 
adaptable to meet functional changes that can be anticipated as well as 
providing flexibility to meet indeterminate future changes in use, 
occupancy or other functions.

    3.1.3.4  Outdoor athletic facilities;
    3.1.3.5  Lighting power for display lighting required for art 
exhibits or displays in galleries, museums and monuments;
    3.1.3.6  Exterior lighting for public monuments;
    3.1.3.7  Special lighting needs for research;
    3.1.3.8  Lighting power for lighting used solely for indoor plant 
growth during the hours of 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.;
    3.1.3.9  Emergency lighting that is automatically ``off'' during 
normal operation;

    3.1.3.13  Store-front exterior-enclosed display windows in retail 
facilities; and
    3.1.3.14  Lighting for dwelling units.
    3.1.4  Building Lighting Power Allowance. The lighting power 
allowance for a building consists of the Exterior Lighting Power 
Allowance (ELPA), in accordance with section 3.3, plus the Interior 
Lighting Power Allowance (ILPA) in accordance with section 3.4 or 3.5. 
This lighting power allowance is the upper limit to which the building 
can be designed, based on the criteria of the compliance alternative 
chosen.
    3.1.4.1  The prescriptive criteria in section 3.4 provides a single 
compliance procedure based on calculating a lighting budget by building 
type or major area type within which a designer can flexibly design a 
lighting solution. To obtain credit for specific lighting energy 
conservation measures, use section 3.5, section 11.0, or section 12.0.
    3.1.4.2  The systems performance criteria in section 3.5 provides a 
more complex compliance procedure based on calculating a lighting budget 
by activity or spaces within which the designer can flexibly design a 
lighting solution and receive credit for energy conserving controls and 
daylighting measures. To receive credit for more complex lighting 
conservation measures use section 11.0 or 12.0.
    3.1.5  Credit for Daylighting. Daylighting credit, for reduced use 
of electric lighting energy resulting from the use of automatic lighting 
control devices in conjunction with fenestration (e.g., windows and 
skylights), may be taken if the systems performance alternative in 
section 3.5 is chosen. However, if such daylighting credit is to be 
applied to other building subsystems, such as use of additional 
fenestration area, section 11.0 or 12.0 must be used. Thermal credit 
provisions for daylighting are found in Section 5.0.
    3.1.6  Compliance. A building shall be considered in compliance with 
this section if the following conditions are met:
    3.1.6.1  The minimum requirements of section 3.3 are met;
    3.1.6.2  The exterior lighting power to be installed is not greater 
than the Exterior Lighting Power Allowance (ELPA), calculated using 
Equation 3.3-1;
    3.1.6.3  The interior lighting power to be installed is not greater 
than the Interior Lighting Power Allowance (ILPA), based on either the 
Prescriptive Criteria in section 3.4 or the Systems Performance Criteria 
in section 3.5.
    3.1.6.4  Tradeoffs between ILPA and ELPA are not allowed. Tradeoffs 
of the interior Lighting Power Budgets (LPB) among interior spaces are 
allowed as long as the total Connected Lighting Power (CLP) within the 
building does not exceed the Interior Lighting Power Allowance (ILPA) 
and Lighting Power Control Credits (LPCC) are used only for connected 
lighting power in those spaces for which credit is claimed.

[[Page 281]]

Tradeoffs of exterior lighting power budgets among exterior areas are 
allowed as long as the total Connected Lighting Power (CLP) of exterior 
lighting does not exceed the Exterior Lighting Power Allowance (ELPA) 
and the allowance for the building exterior surfaces is not exceeded.
    3.1.7  Multi-Building Facilities. The total lighting power 
allowances for each building in a multi-building facility shall be 
calculated separately.

                        3.2  Principles of Design

    3.2.1  The lighting system is designed to provide a productive, 
safe, and pleasing visual environment for the intended use of the space. 
However, lighting is both a major energy end use in commercial buildings 
(especially in office buildings) and a major contributor to internal 
loads by increasing cooling loads and decreasing heating loads. 
Therefore, it is important to produce a design that meets the lighting 
functional criteria of the space as well as one that minimizes energy 
use. Recommended maintained illuminance levels for visual tasks and 
surrounding lighted areas are included in the IES Lighting Handbook, 
Applications (1983) or Reference (1985). Principles of energy conserving 
design within that context are described below.
    3.2.2  The following Design Concepts shall be considered in the 
design of lighting that is both energy efficient and visually effective.
    3.2.2.1  Energy use is determined by the lighting load (demand 
power) and its duration of use (time). Minimize the actual demand load 
rather than just the apparent connected load, and control the load 
rather than just switching, if switching may adversely affect the 
quality of the luminous environment.
    3.2.2.2  Consider daylighting along with the proper use of controls 
so that the savings from electric lighting can be realized. Design 
should be sensitive to window glare, sudden changes in luminances, and 
general use acceptance of controls. Window treatment (blinds, drapes and 
shades) and glazing should be carefully selected to control direct solar 
penetration and luminance extremes while still maintaining view and 
daylight penetration.
    3.2.2.3  Design lighting systems so that illumination required for 
tasks is primarily limited to the location of the task and from a 
direction that will minimize direct glare and veiling reflections on the 
task. For example, the ideal positioning of work stations is between the 
rows of ceiling-mounted luminaires with the direction of view parallel 
to the primary task. In densely-occupied work spaces, uniform 
distribution of general lighting may be most appropriate. Where 
supplementary task illumination is necessary, general or ambient 
illumination should not be lower than a third of the luminance required 
for the task. This will help maintain luminance rates that are visually 
comfortable.
    3.2.2.4  Use task lighting, whenever possible, to accommodate the 
need for higher lighting levels due to task visual difficulty, glare, 
intermittently changing requirements, or individual visual differences 
(poor and aging eyesight).
    3.2.2.5  Group similar activities so high illuminance or special 
lighting for particular tasks are localized in certain rooms or areas, 
and so that less efficient fixtures required for critical glare control 
do not have to be installed uniformly when they are only required 
sparsely.
    3.2.2.6  When indirect lighting is appropriate, use schemes that 
create reasonably uniform ceiling luminances. If this is achieved, work 
spaces may be located anywhere and occupants may face in any direction 
without being subject to excessive veiling reflection on the tasks. The 
indirect system may allow more effective use of the space than other 
types of lighting systems. However, indirect lighting systems generally 
have lower utilization factors, and may require increased ceiling height 
to provide uniform ceiling luminance.
    3.2.2.7  Use lighting controls throughout that maintain proper 
lighting levels when and where it is needed but also allow reductions in 
lighting when tasks are less critical, or spaces are not fully occupied. 
The designer must consider user acceptance of control strategies to 
maximize energy efficiency.

[[Page 282]]

    3.2.2.8  Use lower levels of ambient lighting in situations such as 
merchandising, where the contrast between accent lighting and ambient 
lighting is critical. Accent lighting shall not exceed five (5) times 
the ambient level. Consider fewer, more effectively-accented displays, 
rather than more ineffectively-accented ones.
    3.2.3  The following guidelines identify Fixture and Lamp selection 
strategies to be considered in the selection of luminaires and lamps for 
inclusion in an energy efficient, visually-effective design:
    3.2.3.1  Consider the use of more efficient equipment with 
appropriate distribution, glare control and visual characteristics. 
Utilize fixture designs that will provide high lighting efficiency while 
meeting the other lighting objectives of the installation.
    3.2.3.2  Review visual comfort probability (VCP) data, available 
from manufacturers, for specific luminaires when minimizing discomfort 
glare is a criterion.
    3.2.3.3  Consider luminaire construction that minimizes light loss 
due to dirt collection.
    3.2.3.4  Investigate the use of dimmers to reduce energy consumption 
when the system is new and capable of providing more light than the 
average depreciated design value.
    3.2.3.5  Use more efficient lamps with appropriate luminous 
efficacy, life expectancy and spectrum distribution and color rendering 
characteristics.
    3.2.3.6  Use more efficient ballasts for fluorescent and HID lamps 
with appropriate ballast factors, power factor, noise rating, starting 
and restarting characteristics.
    3.2.3.7  Use luminaires with heat removal and heat recovery 
capabilities, thereby allowing the lighting equipment to operate more 
efficiently at a lower ambient temperature.
    3.2.3.8  Limit the use of lower efficiency lamps, such as 
incandescent, to only those applications where their color, lumens or 
distribution characteristics cannot be duplicated by other sources. Due 
to their lower efficiency, the use of ``extended service'' incandescent 
lamps should be limited to those applications where fixtures are 
difficult to reach and/or maintenance costs for revamping will be 
excessive.
    3.2.4  Space Design
    3.2.4.1  It is important to carry through on the lighting design 
when completing the interior design. Reduce light absorption by 
encouraging the use of lighter finishes, particularly on ceilings, walls 
and partitions. Select colors and surface materials so that their 
reflectance values are within the ranges recommended by the IES. This 
will aid the efficient use of light and help to provide comfortable 
luminance ratios.
    3.2.4.2  In offices with visual display terminals (VDT) that are 
susceptible to reflections, it may be necessary to use reflectances for 
some room surfaces at the low end of the recommended ranges to reduce 
unwanted reflections on the screens. Where practical, treat the screens 
of VDTs with anti-glare materials to avoid veiling reflection.

                        3.3  Minimum Requirements

    3.3.1  Lighting Controls.
    3.3.1.1  All lighting shall be provided with manual, automatic, or

    3.3.1.2  Minimum Number of Lighting Controls. Each space enclosed by 
walls or ceiling-height partitions shall be provided with control(s) 
that, together or alone are capable of controlling all lights within 
that space, excluding those requiring continuous operation for security 
purposes.
    3.3.1.2.1  The minimum number of controls shall not be less than:
    (a) One lighting control for each space; and
    (b) One lighting control for each task or group of task locations 
within an area of 450 ft\2\ or less.
    3.3.1.2.2  Equivalent Number of Controls. The minimum number of 
controls may be reduced, by using an equivalent number of controls from 
Table 3.3-1, where control types listed in Table 3.3-1 are used. 
However, the minimum number of controls may not be reduced to less than 
one control for each 1500 W of connected lighting power.

    3.3.1.2.3  Exceptions to Section 3.3.1.2:
    (a) Lighting control requirements for spaces that must be used as a

these criteria.

[[Page 284]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.083


    3.3.2.2  The Ballast Efficacy Factor shall be calculated in 
accordance with Equation 3.3-1:

                                                                        
                                                    BF                  
              BEF=               ---------------------------------------
                                                Power Input             
                                                                        

                             Equation 3.3-1

Where:

BEF=Ballast Efficacy Factor.
BF=Ballast Factor, expressed as a percent.
Power Input=Total Wattage of combined lamps and ballasts

    3.3.2.2.1  Tests for ballast factor and power input shall be in

watt, or F96T12H0 110 watt lamps.
    3.3.2.3  One-lamp or three-lamp fluorescent luminaires shall be 
tandem-wired to eliminate unnecessary use of single lamp ballasts if 
they are: used for general lighting; recess mounted within ten feet 
center-to-center of each other; or pendant or surface mounted within 1

           3.4  Lighting--Prescriptive Compliance Alternative

                             3.4.1  Purpose

    3.4.1.1  This subsection provides a prescriptive procedure for 
determining an exterior lighting power allowance and the Interior 
Lighting Power Allowances for illumination systems installed in six 
types of new buildings. It is intended for use with buildings having 
simple lighting requirements and where the minimum amount of calculation 
and effort to achieve compliance is of primary concern. For other 
building types, to receive credit for switching, daylighting, or other 
trade-offs, or to receive credit for lighting optimization, use section 
3.5, section 11.0, or section 12.0.

[[Page 285]]

    3.4.1.2  This section also serves as the basis for calculating the 
skylight area in section 5.3.9.6, and may be used for estimating the 
lighting heat gain for calculating the internal load density in Equation 
5.4-1 and section 5.5.6.2.

                             3.4.2  General

    3.4.2.1  This method for compliance prescribes a total allowable 
Unit Lighting Power Allowance (ULPA) for interior lighting for the 
building type/area as listed in Table 3.4-1. There is no recognition of 
specific makeup of spaces and activities within the building.

                3.4.3  Exterior Lighting Power Allowance

    3.4.3.1  Building exteriors and exterior areas, as defined in 
section 3.1.2.2, and roads, grounds, parking, and other exterior areas, 
defined in section 3.1.2.3, shall have a lighting power density not to 
exceed the Exterior Lighting Power Allowance (ELPA), which is the sum of 
the allowances for each of the areas listed above, as calculated by 
Equation 3.4-1 using unit power densities from Table 3.4-2.

          3.4-2.
A=Exterior area in ft<SUP>2</SUP>.

                3.4.4  Interior Lighting Power Allowance

    3.4.4.1  The Interior Lighting Power Allowance (ILPA) shall be 
calculated using the prescriptive Unit Lighting Power Allowances (ULPA) 
in Table 3.4-1. First, determine if the predominant function of the 
proposed building is one of the six building types listed in Table 3.4-
1. If not, section 3.5, 11.0, or 12.0 must be used. Next, determine 
whether the proposed design has secondary functions that are 10% or more 
of the gross lighted area of the building and are listed in Table 3.4-1. 
If so, the designer has the option of using the predominant building 
function to calculate the ILPA or using the calculation method for 
multiple-use buildings in section 3.4.4.1.2 below.
    3.4.4.1.1  If the proposed building has only one function, has no 
secondary functions with 10% or more of the gross lighted area, or the 
designer chooses to determine the ILPA based on only one function, 
Equation 3.4-2 shall be used to determine the building ILPA. First, 
select the appropriate building type in Table 3.4-1, and the appropriate 
column for the Gross Lighted Area (GLA) of the proposed building. This 
value is the Unit Lighting Power Allowance (ULPA). Determine the ILPA by 
multiplying the ULPA by the GLA as shown in Equation 3.4-2.
ILPA=ULPA x GLA

                             Equation 3.4-2

Where:
ILPA=Interior Lighting Power Allowance, in Watts.
ULPA=Unit Lighting Power Allowance, in W/ft\2\,from Table 3.4-1.
GLA=Gross Lighted Area of the Proposed Building, in ft\2\.
    3.4.4.1.2  If a building design has more than one function listed in 
Table 3.4-1, such as an office building with parking and retail stores, 
with more than 10% of the gross lighted area, Equation 3.4-3 may be used 
to calculate the building Interior Lighting Power Allowance (ILPA). 
First, determine the gross lighted area of the building (GLA) and the 
gross lighted area for each qualifying secondary function 
(GLA<INF>f</INF>) in the building. Select the ULPA from Table 3.4-1 
under the column corresponding to the gross lighted area of the entire 
proposed building and multiply it by the gross lighted area of that 
function. Sum the products to determine the building ILPA, as shown in 
Equation 3.4-3 below.
ILPA=ULPA<INF>p</INF> GLA<INF>p</INF>+<greek-S> (ULPA<INF>i</INF> 
          GLA<INF>i</INF>)= [ULPA<INF>p</INF>

          ULPA<INF>f2</INF> GLA<INF>f2</INF> . . . ULPA<INF>fn</INF> 
          GLA<INF>f</INF>)]

                             Equation 3.4-3

Where:

i=numerical subscript (1,2, . . . n) for each secondary function with 
          10% or more of the gross lighted area of the building.
n=number of secondary functions.
ILPA=Interior Lighting Power Allowance, in Watts.
ULPA<INF>p</INF>=Unit Lighting Power Allowance of the predominant 
          function based on the gross lighted area of the entire 
          building, from Table 3.4-1, in W/ft<SUP>2</SUP>.
ULPA<INF>f</INF>=Unit Lighting Power Allowance of qualifying secondary 
          functions based on the gross lighted area of the entire 
          building, from Table 3.4-1, in W/ft<SUP>2</SUP>.
GLA<INF>p</INF>=Gross lighted area of the predominant function of the 
          proposed building.
GLA<INF>f</INF>=Gross lighted area of each qualifying secondary 
          function.

    3.4.4.3  Lighting compliance in partially defined speculative 
buildings. For defined functions in partially defined speculative 
buildings, the total connected lighting power shall not exceed the 
interior lighting power allowance for that portion of the building. When 
determining the ILPA for those cases, the gross lighted area of the 
entire building must be used.

        3.5  Lighting--System Performance Compliance Alternative

                             3.5.1  Purpose

    3.5.1.1  This subsection provides a procedure for determining the 
maximum lighting power allowance for buildings, roads and grounds. It 
allows the designer to take credit for the use

[[Page 289]]

of daylighting and other lighting controls. It also serves as a basis 
for estimating the lighting heat gain and lighting energy use for 
Section 5.0.

                             3.5.2  General

    3.5.2.1  The total Connected Lighting Power (CLP) in a building, 
including permanently installed lighting plus supplemental or task 
related lighting provided by movable fixtures or plug-in luminaires, 
shall not exceed the Interior Lighting Power Allowance (ILPA). A 
Lighting Power Control Credit (LPCC), taken for individual spaces, may 
only be utilized for credit to connected lighting power in those spaces 
for which credit is claimed.
    3.5.2.2  Compliance for lighting in partially defined speculative 
buildings. The total connected lighting power of lighting designs of 
defined areas of partially defined speculative buildings shall not 
exceed the interior lighting power allowance for those areas of the 
building for which lighting has been designed.
    3.5.3  The Lighting Power Budget (LPB) of each interior space shall 
be determined in accordance with Equation 3.5-1.

LPB=(A x UPD<INF>b</INF> x AF)+LPCC

                             Equation 3.5-1

AF=Area factor of the room, (Figure 3.5-1)
LPCC=Lighting Power Control Credit, as determined by Sec. 3.5.6

    3.5.3.1  The room area (A) shall be calculated from the inside 
dimensions of the room.
    3.5.3.2  The Base Unit Power Density (UPD) shall be selected from 
Table 3.5-1. For applications to areas or activities other than those 
given, select values for similar areas or activities.

    3.5.3.3  The Area Factor (AF) shall be determined from Figure 3.5-1 
based on the floor area and ceiling height of the room. Rooms with 
identical ceiling height and activities, and with similar size may be 
treated as a group. The AF of such a group of rooms shall be determined 
from the average area of the rooms.
    Equation 3.5-2 gives the formula used in developing Figure 3.5-1.

    3.5.4  Special Spaces and Activities.
    3.5.4.1  Multi-Function Rooms.
    3.5.4.1.1  For rooms serving multi-functions, such as hotel banquet/
meeting rooms and office conference/presentation rooms, an adjustment 
factor of 1.5 times the base UPD may be used if a supplementary lighting 
system is actually installed to serve the secondary function of the room 
and the design meets the following conditions:
    (a) The installed power for the supplementary system shall not be 
greater than 33% of the adjusted LPB calculated for that room; and
    (b) Independent controls shall be installed for the supplementary 
lighting system.
    3.5.4.2  Simultaneous Activities.
    3.5.4.2.1  In rooms containing multiple simultaneous activities, 
such as a large general office having separate accounting and drafting 
areas within the same room, the LPB for the rooms shall be the weighted 
average of the activities in proportion to the areas being served.
    3.5.4.3  Indoor Sports.
    3.5.4.3.1  The floor area of indoor sports activities areas shall be 
considered as the area within the playing boundaries of the sport, plus 
the floor area 10 ft beyond the playing boundaries, not to exceed the 
total floor area of the indoor room less the spectator seating area.
    3.5.5  Calculation of Interior Lighting Power Allowance. The system 
performance Interior Lighting Power Allowance (ILPA) shall be calculated 
in accordance with Equation 3.5-3. The ILPA shall include a 0.20 W/
ft<SUP>2</SUP> allowance for unlisted spaces.

ILPA=(LPB<INF>1</INF> x LS<INF>1</INF>+LPB<INF>2</INF> x LS<INF>2</INF>--

    3.5.6  Lighting Power Controls Credit and Power Adjustment Factor
    3.5.6.1  When calculating the ULPA in this section, the connected 
power for lights automatically controlled by daylighting sensors, 
occupancy sensor, programmable timing controls, or lumen maintenance 
controls may be reduced by factoring control credits on a specific area 
by area basis. This credit is termed the Lighting Power Controls Credit 
(LPCC) and shall be determined in accordance with Equation 3.5-4:

LPCC=CLP x PAF

                             Equation 3.5-4

Where:

LPCC=Lighting Power Controls Credit, Watts
CLP=Connected Lighting Power for the luminaires controlled by the 
          automatic control device, Watts
PAF=Power Adjustment Factor, from Table 3.5-2

The adjusted lighting power (ALP) is then equal to CLP minus the LPCC.
    3.5.6.2  The Lighting Power Controls Credit is limited to the 
specific luminaires controlled by the automatic control device.
    3.5.6.2.1  Only one adjustment factor may be used for each building 
space or luminaire, and 50% or more of the controlled luminaire shall be 
within the applicable space to qualify for the power adjustment factor.
    3.5.6.2.2  Controls shall be installed in series with the lights and 
in series with all manual switching devices in order to qualify for an 
adjustment factor.
    3.5.6.2.3  When sufficient daylight is available, daylight sensing 
controls shall be capable of reducing electrical power consumption for 
lighting, continuously or in steps, to 50% or less of maximum power 
consumption.
    3.5.6.2.4  Daylight sensing controls shall control all luminaires to 
which the power adjustment factor is applied and that direct a minimum 
of 50% of their light output into the daylight zone.
    3.5.6.2.5  Occupancy sensors located in daylighted spaces should be 
installed in conjunction with a manual ON switch, or photocell override 
for ON.

[[Page 296]]

    3.5.6.2.6  Programmable timing controls used for credit in 
conjunction with Table 3.5-2 shall be:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.091

    (a) Programmable for different schedules for occupied and unoccupied 
days;
    (b) Accessible for temporary override by occupants of individual 
zones, spaces or tasks, with automatic return to the original schedules; 
and
    (c) Capable of keeping time during power outages for a minimum of 
four hours.

Sec. 435.104  Auxiliary systems and equipment.

                              4.1  General

    This section contains a few minimum requirements for auxiliary 
systems and equipment. Because auxiliary systems and equipment vary 
greatly among buildings, the section is not more comprehensive.

                        4.2  Principles of Design

    4.2.1  Energy recovery should be used when coincident thermal and 
refrigeration loads of similar magnitude are expected.
    4.2.2  Consideration shall be given to the use of waste heat, energy 
recovery or heat tape systems to conserve energy.

                        4.3  Minimum Requirements

    4.3.1  Transportation Systems.
    4.3.1.1  Automatic elevator and/or conveyor systems shall 
incorporate schedule controls and efficient motor controls, such as 
solid state control devices.
    4.3.2  Freeze Protection System.
    4.3.2.1  Boilers or water heaters used for purposes such as freeze 
protection in fire protection storage vessels and defrosting sidewalks 
and driveways shall meet the efficiency requirements of sections 8.3 or 
9.3 when they operate in excess of 750 hours per year.
    4.3.3  Retail Food and Food Service Refrigeration.
    4.3.3.1  Refrigeration systems containing multiple compressors shall 
have compressors sized to optimally match capacity with loads.
    4.3.3.2  Variable speed shall be considered.


<R05>
Sec. 435.105  Building Envelope.

                              5.1  General

    5.1.1  This section contains requirements for the energy conscious 
design of building envelopes. It sets principles of good envelope 
design, and provides a set of minimum requirements and two alternative 
compliance paths--prescriptive and system performance.
    5.1.2  Compliance. A building shall be considered in Compliance with 
this section if the following conditions are met:
    5.1.2.1  The minimum requirements of Section 5.3 are met;
    5.1.2.2  The design of the building envelope complies with either 
the prescriptive criteria of section 5.4 or the system performance 
criteria of section 5.5. For the design of buildings with high internal 
heat gains, unusual operating schedules, or that incorporate innovative 
design strategies, consideration shall be given to using the compliance 
paths set forth in sections 11.0 or 12.0.
    5.1.3  The prescriptive compliance alternative of section 5.4 
provides requirements for buildings designed to take advantage of 
perimeter daylighting, thermal mass, high performance glazings, and 
fenestration shading. The designer is allowed to make trade-offs between 
thermal mass, wall insulation, amount of fenestration, shading 
coefficients, shading projections, thermal transmittance of the glazing, 
daylighting for several different climate locations.
    5.1.4  The systems performance compliance alternative of section 3.5 
provides calculation procedures that give

[[Page 297]]

credit for the benefits of more complex energy conserving envelope 
designs.
    5.1.5  Information on thermal properties, performance of building 
envelope sections and components, and heat transfer shall be obtained 
from the ASHRAE Handbook, 1985 Fundamentals Volume. When information is 
not available from this source, the data shall be obtained from 
laboratory or field test measurements conducted in accordance with ASTM 
Standard C-177-85, ``Standard Test Method for Steady-State Thermal 
Transmission Properties by Means of the Guarded Hot Plate,'' ASTM 
Standard C-518-85, ``Steady-State Thermal Transmission Properties by 
Means of the Heat Flow Meter,'' ASTM Standard C-236-80, ``Standard Test 
Method for Steady-State Thermal Performance of Building Assemblies by 
Means of a Guarded Hot Box,'' and ASTM Standard C-976-82, ``Thermal 
Performance of Building Assemblies By Means of a Calibrated Hot Box.''
    5.1.6  Daylighting Credit. In this section, daylighting credit for 
reduced energy use resulting from the use of automatic lighting control 
devices in conjunction with fenestration, is given only for space 
heating and cooling loads. Credit for the reduced use of electric 
lighting energy is calculated in section 3.5.6. If daylighting credit 
for reduced electric lighting energy use is desired to be applied to 
other building systems, such as more fenestration area, section 11.0 or 
12.0 should be used.
    5.1.7  The requirements of this section are not intended to replace 
building loads calculation procedures.

                        5.2  Principles of Design

                          5.2.1  Building Loads

    5.2.1.1  Building loads result from sources external and internal to 
the building. (1) External loads, from outdoor temperature, humidity, 
wind, and insolation, fluctuate daily and seasonally. (2) Internal loads 
from the activities conducted within the building, including heating and 
moisture produced by the occupants, lights, and process equipment (e.g., 
appliances, computers) vary with internal activities. Improving energy 
efficiency in a building depends on achieving a balance between and 
among the internal and external loads. The building design should, 
therefore, offset gains and losses of heat, light, and moisture between 
the interior and exterior of the building, among interior spaces, and 
over-time, (daily, seasonally, and annually).
    5.2.1.2  This balance of loads can be most efficiently achieved if 
the building envelope is viewed as, and designed to be, a controlled 
membrane rather than an immutable barrier. The typical design of a 
modern building has considered the building envelope to be a fixed 
barrier that restricts heat and air flow to the maximum extent possible. 
This will not usually yield the most energy efficient building.
    5.2.1.3  The desired goal of the energy design of the building 
envelope shall be to produce a controlled membrane that allows or 
prevents heat, light, and moisture flow to achieve a balance between 
internal and external loads. Thus the envelope becomes an integral part 
of the building's environmental conditioning systems.
    5.2.1.4  To achieve control of the building envelope as a membrane, 
and to simultaneously achieve occupant comfort in the perimeter zones, 
many of the traditional building skin components must be used 
(insulation, mass, caulking and weather stripping). However, other 
concepts shall also be considered to temper supply air or utilize waste 
heat in exhaust air to temper envelope conditions, such as operable 
solar shading devices, and the integration of glazing systems with the 
HVAC distribution system.

                   5.2.1.5  Control of External Loads

                    5.2.1.5.1  Control of Conduction

    (a) Controlled conductivity may be considered through the careful 
use of insulation, sensible (mass) or phase-change storage and movable 
insulation at levels which minimizes net heating and cooling loads on a 
time integrated (annual) basis.
    (b) Unintentional or uncontrolled thermal bridges shall be minimized 
and considered in energy related calculations since they can radically 
alter the conductivity of a building envelope. Examples include wall 
studs, balconies, ledges, and extensions of building slabs.

[[Page 298]]

         5.2.1.5.2  Control of Infiltration (Heat Loss or Gain)

    (a) Infiltration shall be minimized and all efforts to achieve a 
zero level shall be taken. This will minimize fan energy consumption in 
pressurized buildings during occupied periods and heat loss (or unwanted 
heat gain in warm climates) during unoccupied periods. Infiltration 
reduction shall be accomplished through design details that enhance the 
fit and integrity of building envelope joints in a way that may be 
readily achieved during building construction. This includes 
infiltration control by caulking, weather stripping, vestibule doors 
and/or revolving doors with construction meeting or exceeding accepted 
specifications.
    (b) The quantity of mechanical ventilation must vary with the need, 
with recommended values at any given time equal to that required by 
ASHRAE Standard 62-1981. Higher levels of ventilation (e.g., 
economizers) shall be considered to substitute for mechanical cooling.
    (c) Operable windows may be considered to allow for occupant 
controlled ventilation. When using operable windows, the design of the 
building's mechanical system must be carefully executed to minimize 
unnecessary HVAC energy consumption, and building operators must be 
cautioned about the improper use of the operable windows.
    (d) Non-mechanical ventilation can be enhanced in the shape of the 
building as well as the physical elements of the building envelope, such 
as cupolas.
    (e) For hotels and high rise dwelling units and other systems having 
exhaust totalling 3000 cfm or more, with annual operation in excess of 
3000 hours and within 200 linear ft of simultaneous make-up air 
equipment, they shall incorporate energy recovery or treatment to ASHRAE 
62-1981 quality levels and reuse exhaust air when allowed by code.

          5.2.1.5.3  Control of Radiated Heat Losses and Gains

    (a) Capability for occupant radiant comfort shall be maintained 
regardless of whether the building envelope is designed to be a static 
or dynamic membrane. Opaque surfaces shall be designed so that the 
average inside surface temperatures will remain within 5  deg.F of room 
temperature in the coldest anticipated weather (i.e., winter design 
conditions), and the coldest inside surface will remain within 25  deg.F 
of the room temperature.
    (b) In a building with time-varying internal heat generation, 
thermal mass may be considered for controlling radiant comfort. In the 
perimeter zone, thermal mass is more effective when it is positioned 
internal to the envelope insulation.
    (c) The effective control of solar radiation is critical to the 
design of energy-efficient buildings due to the high level of internal 
heat production already present in most commercial building types. In 
some climates, the lighting energy consumption savings due to 
daylighting techniques can be greater than the heating and cooling 
energy penalties from additional glazed surface area, provided that the 
building envelope is properly designed for daylighting and lighting 
controls are installed and used. In other climates they may not. 
Daylighting designs are most effective if direct solar beam radiation is 
not allowed to cause glare in building spaces.
    (d) The transparent portions of the building envelope shall be 
designed to prevent solar radiant gain above that necessary for 
effective daylighting and solar heating. On south-facing facades, the 
use of low shading coefficients is generally not as effective as 
external physical shading devices in achieving this balance. Light 
shelves offer a very effective means of admitting daylight while shading 
the view glazing and simultaneously allowing occupants to manipulate 
interior shading devices (draperies, blinds) without eliminating day 
light.
    (e) The solar spectrum contains a range of wavelengths including 
visible and infrared (heat). Designers shall consider which portion of 
the spectrum to admit into the building. For example, low emissivity, 
high-visible-transmittance glazings may be considered for the effective 
control of radiant heat gains and losses. For shading control designers 
may consider the careful use of vegetation that can block excess

[[Page 299]]

gain, year-around or seasonally depending on the plant species chosen.

                        5.3  Minimum Requirements

          5.3.1  Overall Thermal Transmittance (U<INF>o</INF>)

    5.3.1.1  The overall thermal transmittance of the building envelope 
above grade assembly shall be calculated as follows:

                                                                        
             U<INF>o=<greek-S>U<INF>iA<INF>i/A<INF>o=(U<INF>1A<INF>1+U<INF>2A<INF>2+ . . . +U<INF>nA<INF>n)/A<INF>o            
                                                                         
                                                                        
                                                                        

                             Equation 5.3-1

Where:
U<INF>o</INF>=the area weighted average thermal transmittance of the 
          gross area of the building envelope assembly, e.g., the 
          exterior wall assembly including fenestration and doors; roofs 
          and ceiling assembly; or the floor assembly, Btu/h<bullet>ft 
          \2\<bullet> deg.F.
A<INF>o</INF>=the gross area of the envelope assembly, ft \2\.
U<INF>i</INF>=the thermal transmittance of each individual path of the 
          envelope assembly (see Section 5.3.2), U<INF>i</INF>=1/
          R<INF>i</INF> (where R<INF>1</INF> is the total resistance to 
          heat flow of an individual path through an envelope assembly).
A<INF>i</INF>=the area of each individual element of the envelope 
          assembly, ft \2\.

        5. 3. 2  Thermal Resistance of Below Grade Components (R)

    5.3.2.1  In calculating the thermal resistance of all below grade 
components, the thermal performance of the adjacent ground shall be 
excluded.

                             5.3.2.2  Slabs

    5.3.2.2.1  The R-value required for slabs refers only to the 
insulation materials. Insulative continuity shall be maintained in the 
design of slab edge insulation systems. Continuity shall be maintained 
from the wall insulation through the slab/wall/footing intersection to 
the body of the slab edge insulation.
    5.3.2.2.2  Slab-on-grade floors shall have insulation around the 
perimeter of the floor with the thermal resistance (R<INF>u</INF>) of 
the insulation specified in accordance with Figure 5.5-2. The slab 
insulation specified shall extend either in a vertical plane downward 
from the top of the slab for the minimum distance shown or downward to 
the bottom of the slab then in a horizontal plane beneath the slab or 
outward from the building for the minimum distance shown. The horizontal 
length, or vertical depth, of insulation required varies from 24 in. to 
48 in. depending upon the R-value selected. For heated slabs, an R of 2 
shall be added to the thermal resistance required.
    5.3.2.2.3  Vertical insulation shall not be required to extend below 
the foundation footing. There are no insulation requirements for slabs 
in locations having less than 3,000 HDD65 or for footings extending less 
than 18 in. below grade.
    5.3.2.2.4  The dimensional requirements for horizontal insulation 
refers to the insulation materials only. Horizontal applications shall 
have a thermal break in the slab edge that provides continuity between 
the wall insulation on the slab and the horizontal insulation.

                             Below Grade Walls

    5.3.2.3.1  The R-value required for Below Grade Walls refers to the 
overall R-value of the wall assembly excluding air film coefficients and 
the thermal performance of the adjacent ground.

  5.3.3  Thermal Transmittance (U<INF>i</INF>) of an Envelope Assembly

    5.3.3.1  The thermal transmittance of each envelope assembly shall 
be determined with due consideration of all major series and parallel 
heat flow paths through the elements of the assembly. Compression of 
insulation shall be considered in determining the thermal resistance.
    5.3.3.2  The thermal transmittance of opaque assemblies 
U<INF>i</INF> shall be determined using a series path procedure that 
corrects parallel paths, such as insulation and studs in a wall cavity 
or the roof assembly shown in Figure 5.3-1. Table 5.3-1 prescribes the 
procedure to be used for Subsections 5.3.3.2.1 and 5.3.3.2.2.

as those provided in Tables 5.3-2 and 5.3-3, is available, the total 
resistance of the series path may be calculated using Equations 5.3-2a 
and 5.3-2b, and illustrated in Figure 5.3-1:

                           R<INF>TB=R<INF>1+R<INF>2+R<INF>3+R<INF>4+R<INF>5                           
                                                                         
                             Equation 5.3-3                             
                                                                         
                                                                        
                                                                        

    (i) Where R<INF>1</INF>, the effective mean flow path along the 
outer metal surface, is calculated by:

    (ii) And if it occurs, the resistance of insulation (R<INF>2</INF>) 
between the outer metal surface and the metal structural member is 
calculated by:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.098

    (iii) And, the resistance of the structural member (R<INF>3</INF>) 
is calculated by:

                                                                        
                                                         h<INF>3             
         R<INF>3                    =          ------------------------------
                                                    L x t<INF>3 x k<INF>3         
                                                                        

                             Equation 5.3-6

    (iv) And if it occurs, the resistance of insulation (R<INF>4</INF>) 
between the inner metal surface and the purlin flange is calculated by:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.099

    (v) And finally, the effective mean flow path along the inner metal 
surface (R<INF>5</INF>) is calculated by:

Where:
L=total length
h=coefficient of heat transfer
k=thermal conductivity
T=temperature
B=total width
H=partial height
t=thickness of sheet metal

    (2) Then calculate the parallel path resistance of the homogeneous 
insulation R<INF>H</INF> as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.101

    (3) Then obtain the overall construction resistance R<INF>C</INF> by 
combining R<INF>H</INF> and R<INF>TB</INF> as two parallel resistances:

                                                                        
                                                      R<INF>TB x R<INF>H          
          R<INF>C                    =          -----------------------------
                                                       R<INF>TB+R<INF>H           
                                                                        

                             Equation 5.3-10

    (4) Then add the inside and outside surface resistances 
R<INF>i</INF> and R<INF>u</INF> to get the total resistance 
R<INF>TOT</INF>:

                                                                        
                              R<INF>TOT=R<INF>C+R<INF>i+R<INF>u                             
                                                                         
                                                                        
                                                                        

                             Equation 5.3-11

    (5) The total area resistance m<INF>TOT</INF> is then calculated by:

                                                                        
                            m<INF>TOT=R<INF>TOT x B x L                           
                                                                         
                                                                        
                                                                        

                             Equation 5.3-12

    (6) And finally, obtain the U-value by:

                                                                        
                                                           1            
           U                      =           --------------------------
                                                          m<INF>TOT          
                                                                        

                             Equation 5.3-13

    (7) Where additional resistances are introduced in the construction, 
introduce them in lieu of the above (R<INF>2</INF> and R<INF>4</INF>) 
resistances. An example of this would be the calculation of both a 
metallic fastener and a block of higher thermal conductivity material 
between the outer sheet metal and the internal structural member as 
shown in Figure 5.3-3. In this case the original R<INF>2</INF> is re-
calculated by first calculating the thermal bridge R<INF>2TB</INF> as 
follows:

0.45 or less, use the F<INF>f</INF> for triple insulated glazing. 
Alternatively, values of the U<INF>g</INF> deg.F product may be used

capacity.
    5.3.7  Air Leakage and Moisture Migration
    5.3.7.1  The requirements of this subsection apply only to those 
locations separating the outdoors from interior building conditioned

building envelope, such as retail store entrances and loading bays, 
estimates of air leakage for HVAC system design shall be based on air 
exchange by traffic flow.
    5.3.7.2.6  To reduce infiltration due to stack-effect draft in 
multi-story buildings, the use of vestibules or revolving doors on all 
primary entries and exits shall be considered.

lighting power density, equipment power density, or fenestration shading 
device characteristics:
    5.3.8.1.1  Lighting Power Density and Equipment Power Density. For 
section 5.4, the total power density shall be assumed to be those listed 
in Table 5.3-4. For section 5.5, the values in Table 5.3-4 shall be 
assumed to be apportioned as \2/3\ lighting and \1/3\ for other 
equipment. Note that these are not recommended design values, but are 
for compliance purposes only.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.106

    5.3.8.1.2  Fenestration shading devices. Only those shading devices 
that are part of the design when it is being evaluated for compliance 
shall be considered when determining compliance.
    5.3.8.1.3  Daylighting controls for electric lighting. Only those 
controls that are part of the design when it is being evaluated for 
compliance shall be considered when determining compliance.
    5.3.9  Buildings Located in Climates With Greater Than 15,000 HDD 
Base 65  deg.F.
    5.3.9.1  For locations with a heating degree-day base (HDD) 65 
<SUP>o</SUP>F greater than 15,000, the envelope criteria listed in Table 
5.3-5 shall apply, and the window wall ratio (WWR) shall be less than or 
equal to 0.20.

    5.3.10  Daylight Credits for Skylights.
    5.3.10.1  Skylights used in conjunction with automatic lighting 
controls for daylighting can significantly reduce the lighting energy 
consumption, thereby more than offsetting the increase in envelope heat 
transfer.
    5.3.10.2  When determining building roof compliance, daylight 
credits for skylights may be used if the criteria of this subsection are 
met.
    5.3.10.3  Skylights for which daylight credit is taken may be 
excluded from the calculation of the overall thermal transmittance value 
(U<INF>or</INF>) of the roof assembly, if all of the following 
conditions are met:
    5.3.10.3.1  The opaque roof thermal transmittance U<INF>or</INF> 
value does not exceed the value determined within the selected Alternate 
Component Package (ACP) table for the prescriptive method or by Equation 
5.5-1 for the systems performance method.
    5.3.10.3.2  Skylight areas, including framing, as a percentage of 
the roof area do not exceed the values specified in Tables 5.3-6A and 
5.3-6B for building sites located within the climate ranges listed in 
the two Tables, where Visible Light Transmittance (VLT) is the 
transmittance of a particular glazing material over the visible portion 
of the solar spectrum. Skylight areas shall be interpolated between 
visible light transmittance values of 0.75 and 0.50, only.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.109



[[Page 317]]

    5.3.10.3.3  The skylight area associated with daylight credit can be 
taken is the area under each skylight whose dimension in each direction 
(centered on the skylight) is equal to the skylight dimension in that 
direction plus a distance equal to the floor to ceiling height.
    5.3.10.3.4  Skylight areas that overlap areas that have already 
taken daylight credit (perimeter window areas or other skylight areas) 
do not again take daylight credit.
    5.3.10.3.5  All electric lighting fixtures within skylight areas are 
controlled by daylight-activated automatic lighting controls.
    5.3.10.3.6  For buildings located in climates that have less than 
8000 HDD65, the overall thermal transmittance of the skylight assembly, 
including framing, is less than or equal to 0.7 Btu/h<bullet>ft 
\2\<bullet> deg.F. For locations greater than 8000 HDD65, the overall 
thermal transmittance of the skylight assembly, including framing, is 
less than or equal to 0.45 Btu/h<bullet>ft \2\<bullet> deg.F.
    5.3.10.3.7  Skylight curbs have thermal transmittance (U) values no 
greater than 0.21 Btu/h<bullet>ft \2\<bullet> deg.F.
    5.3.10.3.8  The infiltration coefficient of the skylights does not 
exceed 0.05 cfm/ft \2\.
    5.3.10.4  Skylight areas in Tables 5.3-6A and 5.3-6B may be 
increased by 50% if a shading device is used that blocks over 50% of the 
solar gain during the peak cooling design condition.
    5.3.10.5  Areas for vertical glazing in clerestories and roof 
monitors shall be included in the wall fenestration calculation.
    5.3.10.6  For shell buildings, the permitted skylight area from 
Tables 5.3-6A and 5.3-6B shall be based on a light level of 30 fc and a 
lighting power density (LPD) of less than 1 W/ft \2\.
    5.3.10.7  For speculative buildings, the permitted skylight area 
from Tables 5.3-6A and 5.3-6B shall be based on the unit lighting power 
allowance from Table 3.4-1 and an illuminance level as follows:
    5.3.10.7.1  For LPD less than or equal to 1.0 W/ft \2\, use 30 fc;
    5.3.10.7.2  For LPD greater than 1.0 W/ft \2\ and less than 2.5 W/ft 
\2\, use 50 fc; and
    5.3.10.7.3  For LPD greater than 2.5 W/ft \2\, use 70 fc.
    5.3.10.8  Buildings with roof assembly devices that cannot be 
evaluated under this subsection shall be evaluated using the Building 
Energy Compliance Methods of Section 11.0 or 12.0.

       5.4  Building Envelope--Prescriptive Compliance Alternative

    5.4.1  General.
    5.4.1.1  This section provides a simple compliance path using 
precalculated prescriptive requirements for selected exterior envelope 
configurations of new buildings.
    5.4.1.2  The Alternate Component Packages (ACP), found in this 
subsection, provide design criteria for use with the following options:
    5.4.1.2.1  ``Base Case''--buildings with envelopes designed without 
perimeter daylighting.
    5.4.1.2.2  ``Perimeter Daylighting''--buildings with envelopes that 
use additional fenestration area by incorporating automatic lighting 
controls in the perimeter zone to permit the use of daylighting in lieu 
of electric lighting. This ACP is not available for those climates that 
do not usually require space cooling by means of mechanical 
refrigeration.
    (a) This daylighting credit is in addition to the increased lighting 
power allowance provided in section 3.5. Some perimeter daylighting 
options allow a greater proportion of fenestration area due to the 
increased visible and decreased thermal transmittances of high 
performance glazings in combination with automatic lighting controls.
    5.4.1.3  Each ACP provides a limited number of complying 
combinations of building variables for a set of climate ranges. The 
criteria, such as maximum percent fenestration, were calculated using 
the system performance criteria of section 5.5. Values were chosen from 
within climate and other variable ranges for the most restrictive 
results, to ensure compliance of any combination of values within those 
ranges. Thus, for most climate locations and envelope parameters, the 
prescriptive criteria may be slightly more stringent than the system 
performance criteria of section 5.5.

[[Page 318]]

    5.4.1.4  Both the base and perimeter daylight cases have two or 
three fenestration U-value ranges depending on the climate.
    5.4.2  Compliance.
    5.4.2.1  The envelope design of the building being evaluated is in 
compliance with the prescriptive criteria of this section provided that:
    5.4.2.1.1  The minimum requirements of section 5.3 are met.
    5.4.2.1.2  All envelope thermal transmittance (U) values are less 
than or equal to those chosen from the ACP Table selected for roofs, 
opaque walls, walls next to unconditioned spaces, and floors over 
unconditioned spaces.
    5.4.2.1.3  The percentage of fenestration of the combined gross wall 
area is less than or equal to the value permitted for internal load 
range and glazing in the selected ACP Table.
    5.4.2.1.4  Slab-on-grade floors have insulation around the perimeter 
of the floor with the thermal resistance (R<INF>u</INF>) of the 
insulation as listed in the ACP table. The slab insulation specified 
shall extend either in a vertical plane downward from the top of the 
slab for the minimum distance shown or downward to the bottom of the 
slab then in a horizontal plane beneath the slab or outward from the 
building for the minimum distance shown. The horizontal length, or 
vertical depth, of insulation required varies from 24 in. to 48 in. 
depending upon the R-value selected. For heated slabs, an R of 2 shall 
be added to the thermal resistance required.
    (a) Vertical insulation shall not be required to extend below the 
foundation footing.
    (b) There are no insulation requirements for slabs in locations 
having less than 3,000 HDD65 or for footings extending less than 18 in. 
below grade.
    5.4.2.1.5  The thermal resistance of the below-grade wall assembly 
must be greater than or equal to that listed in the ACP table, or the 
heat loss calculated in accordance with Chapter 25 of the ASHRAE 
Handbook, 1985 Fundamentals shall be less than or equal to that of a 
wall below grade having a thermal resistance equal to that specified in 
Figure 5.5-3. No insulation is required for climates with less than 
3,000 HDD65 or for those portions of walls more than one story below 
grade.
    5.4.3  Procedure for Using the Alternate Component Packages (ACP).
    5.4.3.1  The prescriptive envelope criteria for each of 30 climate 
ranges are contained in Tables 5.4-2 through 5.4-31.
    5.4.3.2  The following steps shall be used to determine compliance 
with these prescriptive envelope criteria.
    5.4.3.2.1  Determine appropriate climate range using either (a) or 
(b) below.
    (a) From Table 5.4-1, select the appropriate ACP Table based on the 
climate for the building site. The main climate variables that are 
needed for the proper selection of an ACP Table are cooling degree-days 
base 65  deg.F (CDD65), heating degree-days base 50  deg.F (HDD50), and 
annual average daily incident of solar radiation on the east or west 
vertical surface of the facade, Btu/ft\2\/day (VSEW). For certain 
climate ranges this must be augmented by cooling degree-hours base 80 
deg.F (CDH80).
    (1) This data, for a specific building location, may be acquired 
from the U.S. Weather Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration or the local weather bureau. The column designated ``ACP 
Table No.'' in Table 5.4-1 contains the table number of the appropriate 
ACP Table.

    (b) From the list of cities in Appendix 5A, ``List of Cities and 
Climate Data'', which contains data for 234 cities, select the closest 
city climatologically to the building site. If the site is not one of 
the cities listed or if the climate at the site differs significantly 
from a listed adjacent city, obtain the information from the weather 
bureau or other reliable source and use (a) above. The column designated 
``ACP Table No.'' contains the table number of the appropriate ACP 
Table.
    (c) For information purposes only, the climate data used to develop 
the ACP tables for the above-grade wall section are shown in Table 5.4-
32. The criteria for all other envelope sections was based on the most 
stringent level for the cities listed in the ACP Table.
    5.4.3.2.2  Determination of Maximum Allowable Percent Fenestration.
    (a) Using the appropriate ACP Table, determine the maximum allowable 
percent fenestration. The maximum allowable percent fenestration is the 
total area of fenestration assemblies divided by the total gross 
exterior wall area, considering all elevations of the building. 
Determining the maximum allowable percent fenestration requires the 
following five steps:
    (1) Based on the Internal Load Density (ILD) for the proposed 
design, select one of the three Internal Load Ranges as the point of 
entry to the tables. Note for ILD's greater than 3.5 W/ft \2\ use the 
3.5 W/ft \2\ range. For shell buildings, see procedures in Section 
5.3.8. Determine the ILD of the proposed design, based on the sum of the 
Internal Lighting Power Allowance (ILPA), the Equipment Power Density 
(EPD) and Occupant Load Adjustment (OLA), as shown in Equation 5.4-1.

ILD=ILPA+EPD+OLA

                             Equation 5.4-1

    Where:
    The Internal Lighting Power Allowance (ILPA) shall be:
    1. The building average Internal Lighting Power Allowance (ILPA) of 
the design building in W/ft \2\ as determined in Section 3.4 or 3.5;
    2. The average of the Lighting Power Budgets (LPB) for all activity 
areas within 15 ft of each exterior wall based on the procedures 
specified by the Systems Performance Criteria of Section 3.5.3, or
    3. The actual lighting power density of the proposed design in W/ft 
\2\, either the building average or the average of the lighting power 
within 15 ft of each exterior wall.

    Note.--The lighting prescriptive path, Section 3.4, does not provide 
lighting values for health, assembly, multi-family high rise, and hotel/
motel buildings type occupancies. Use the 1.51 to 3.0 range of Internal 
Load Density for health and assembly buildings; and the 0 to 1.5 range 
for multi-family high rise and hotel/motel buildings.

    The Equipment Power Density (EPD) shall be either:
    1. The building average receptacle power density selected from Table 
5.4-33 in W/ft \2\; or

[[Page 382]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.172


    2. The actual average receptacle power density for all activity 
areas within 15 ft of each exterior wall in W/ft \2\, considering 
diversity. For determining compliance in Tables 5.4-2 through 5.4-31, 
the actual average receptacle power densities calculated by this method 
that exceed 1.0 W/ft \2\ shall be limited to 1.0 W/ft \2\ in Equation 
5.4-1.
    The Occupant Load Adjustment (OLA) shall be either:
    1. 0.0 W/ft\2\. This recognizes the assumed occupant sensible load 
of 0.6 W/ft\2\ that is built into the ACP tables; or
    2. A positive or negative difference between the actual occupant 
load and 0.6 W/ft\2\ if the design building has a larger or smaller 
occupant load.
    (2) Select external shading projection factor (PF). If no external 
shading projections are used in the proposed design, select the column 
designated Projection Factor=0.000-0.249. If external shading 
projections are used, determine the average area weighted projection 
factor on the window in accordance with Equation 5.4-2. Then select the 
appropriate column in the ACP Table.

                                                                        
                                 PF=P<INF>d/H                                
                                                                         
                                                                        
                                                                        

                             Equation 5.4-2

Where:

PF=Average area weighted projection factor
P<INF>d</INF>=External horizontal shading projection depth, in. or ft
H=Sum of height of the fenestration and the distance from the top of the 
          fenestration to the bottom of external shading projection in 
          units consistent with P<INF>d</INF>.


[[Page 383]]


    (3) Select the Shading Coefficient of the fenestration 
(SC<INF>x</INF>) including internal, integral, and external shading 
devices, but excluding the effect of external shading projections (PF). 
This includes curtains, shades, or blinds. Reference ASHRAE Handbook, 
1985 Fundamentals Volume, Chapter 27.
    (4) Select one of the daylighting options, either:
    1. Base Case, no daylighting; or
    2. Perimeter Daylighting (automatic daylight controls for lighting 
system must be used). This option is not available in some locations.
    (5) Select appropriate fenestration type. For most options, this is 
determined by the thermal transmittance value (U<INF>of</INF>) of the 
fenestration assembly. For some fenestration options, the visible light 
transmittance (VLT) of the fenestration should not be less than the 
shading coefficient of the glazed portion of the fenestration assembly, 
not considering any shading devices. The ranges generally correspond to 
single glazing, double glazing, triple glazing and high performance 
glazing incorporating low emissivity coatings/films or more than two 
glazing layers. Each ACP table includes at most, three ranges of glazing 
U-value.
    5.4.4.2.3  Determine the Maximum U<INF>ow</INF> for the Opaque Wall 
Assembly. In the appropriate ACP Table the Maximum U<INF>ow</INF> for 
the opaque wall assembly is determined using the following steps:
    (a) For a lightweight wall assembly, heat capacity (HC) less than 5 
Btu/ft\2\<bullet> deg.F, use the value indicated. This U<INF>ow</INF> is 
constant over all internal load ranges.
    (b) To use the mass wall adjustment, the following additional steps 
are necessary:
    (1) Select the same internal load range as that used in determining 
the maximum allowable percent fenestration.
    (2) Select the mass wall heat capacity (HC) and insulation position. 
If the wall insulation is positioned internal to or integral with the 
wall mass, use the column headed Interior/Integral Insulation. If the 
wall insulation is positioned external to the wall mass use the column 
headed Exterior Insulation. For HC less than 5 Btu/ft\2\<bullet> deg.F 
this adjustment table cannot be used. At this step you will have two 
choices of U<INF>ow</INF> that are keyed to a small or large percent 
fenestration. This represents the full range of U<INF>ow</INF> values 
allowed.
    (3) Select or interpolate the appropriate maximum U<INF>ow</INF> for 
the opaque wall based on the maximum allowable percent fenestration 
determined in Section 5.4.4.2.2 or the actual building percent 
fenestration whichever value is lower. The U<INF>ow</INF> shall be 
determined by straight line interpolation for fenestration percentages 
between the smallest and largest values listed. If the design building 
percentage fenestration is less than the smallest value listed, select 
the U<INF>ow</INF> for the largest percentage fenestration listed.
    5.4.4.2.4  Determine Other Envelope Criteria. In each ACP table, the 
criteria for roof, wall adjacent to unconditioned space, wall below 
grade (first story only), floor over unconditioned space, and slab-on-
grade floors, shall be met. For heated slabs on grade, the R-value shall 
be the R-value for the unheated slab-on-grade plus 2.0. For skylights, 
the daylight credit procedure presented in Section 5.3.10 shall be used.

    5.5  Building Envelope--System Performance Compliance Alternative

    5.5.1  Roof Thermal Transmittance Criteria
    5.5.1.1  Any building that is heated and/or mechanically cooled 
shall have an overall thermal transmittance value (U<INF>or</INF>) for 
the gross area of the roof assembly not greater than the value 
determined by Equation 5.5-1. The provisions of Section 5.3 shall be 
followed in determining acceptable combinations of materials that will 
meet the required U<INF>or</INF> values of Equation
5.5-1.

U<INF>o</INF>=1/
          (5.3+1.8 x 10<SUP>-</SUP>\3\ x HDD65+1.3 x 10<SUP>-3</SUP>
 x CDD65+2.6 x 10<SUP>-4</SUP> x CDH80)

                             Equation 5.5-1

    5.5.1.2  Equation 5.5-1 applies only for climate locations with 
HDD65 less than or equal to 15,000. For climate locations with HDD65 
greater than 15,000, see subsection 5.3.9, Table 5.3-5.
    5.5.1.2.1  Exceptions to Section 5.5.1.2:

[[Page 384]]

    (a) any building that is only heated shall have an overall thermal 
transmittance value (U<INF>or</INF>) for the gross area of the roof 
assembly less than or equal to the value determined by Equation 5.5-1 
with CDD65 and CDH80 set equal to zero; and
    (b) any building that is only mechanically cooled shall have an 
overall thermal transmittance value (U<INF>or</INF>) for the gross area 
of the roof assembly less than or equal to the value determined by 
Equation 5.5-1 with HDD65 set equal to zero.
    5.5.2  Floor Thermal Transmittance Criteria
    5.5.2.1  The floors of any building that is heated and/or 
mechanically cooled shall meet the following thermal criteria:
    5.5.2.1.1  Floors of conditioned spaces over unconditioned spaces 
shall have a thermal transmittance (U<INF>of</INF>) not greater than

    5.5.2.1.2  Slab-on-grade floors shall have insulation around the 
perimeter of the floor with the thermal resistance (R<INF>u</INF>) of 
the insulation as specified in Figure 5.5-2. The insulation specified in 
Figure 5.5-2 shall extend either in a vertical plane downward from the 
top of the slab for the minimum distance shown or downward to the bottom 
of the slab for the minimum distance shown then in a horizontal plane 
beneath the slab. The horizontal length, or vertical depth, of 
insulation required varies from 24 in. to 48 in. depending upon the R-
value selected. For heated slabs, an R of 2 shall be added to the 
thermal resistance required in Figure 5.5-2.

    (a) Vertical insulation is not required to extend below the 
foundation footing. There are no insulation requirements for slabs in 
locations having less than 3,000 HDD65 for footings extending less than 
18 in. below grade.
    5.5.3  Thermal Transmittance Criteria For Opaque Walls Enclosing 
Conditioned Spaces Exposed to Interior Unconditioned Spaces

 5.5.4  Thermal Resistance Criteria for Exterior Wall Insulation Below 
                                  Grade

    5.5.4.1  The thermal resistance (R) of the wall assembly shall be 
greater than, or equal to the insulation level specified in Figure 5.5-
4, or the heat loss calculated in accordance with Chapter 25 of the 
ASHRAE Handbook, 1985 Fundamentals Volume shall be less than, or equal 
to that of a wall below grade having a thermal resistance equal to that 
specified in Figure 5.5-4. No insulation is required for climate 
locations with less than 3,000 HDD65 for those portions of walls more 
than one story below grade.

          5.5.5  External Wall Criteria for Heating and Cooling

    5.5.5.1  The external wall heating criteria (WC<INF>h</INF>) and 
cooling criteria (WC<INF>c</INF>) represent limits on cumulative annual 
heating and cooling energy flux attributable to transmission and solar 
gain. These limits accommodate variation in internal load and wall heat 
capacity. They shall be determined for a building envelope design using 
Equations 5.5-2 and 5.5-6 in Attachment 5B, ``Equations to Determine 
External Wall Heating and Cooling Criteria (WC<INF>c</INF> and 
WC<INF>h</INF>) and to Determine Compliance (C<INF>i</INF> and 
H<INF>i</INF>) With the Criteria.''

            5.5.6  Wall Heating and Cooling Compliance Values

    5.5.6.1  The wall heating compliance value H<INF>i</INF> and the 
wall cooling compliance value C<INF>i</INF> are estimates of the 
cumulative annual heating and cooling energy flux attributable to heat 
transmission and solar gains. These estimates consider the effects of 
variations in internal load and wall heat capacity. They shall be 
calculated using Equations 5.5-2 and 5.5-6 in Attachment 5B.

                     5.5.6.3  Applying the Criteria

    5.5.6.3.1  The wall criteria shall be applied as follows:
    (a) For all buildings that are heated and mechanically cooled, the 
sum of the calculated wall heating and cooling compliance values, 
H<INF>i</INF> and C<INF>i</INF>, for all orientations of the proposed 
design, as determined in section 5.5.6, shall not exceed the sum of the 
corresponding wall criteria for all orientations for wall heating 
(WC<INF>h</INF>) and wall cooling (WC<INF>c</INF>).
    (b) For buildings that are only heated, the sum of the calculated 
wall heating compliance values, H<INF>i</INF>, for all orientations of 
the proposed design, as determined in section 5.5.6, shall not exceed 
the sum of the corresponding wall heating criterion WC<INF>h</INF> for 
all orientations.
    (c) For buildings that are only mechanically cooled, the sum of the 
calculated cooling compliance values, C<INF>i</INF>, for all 
orientations of the proposed design, as determined from section 5.5.6, 
shall not exceed the sum of the corresponding wall cooling criteria, 
WC<INF>c</INF> for all orientations.

          5.5.6.4  Constraints on Thermal Transmittance Values

    5.5.6.4.1  The compliance calculation procedure in section 5.5.6.3 
allows great flexibility in selecting values for envelope components as 
long as the overall criteria are met. In calculating compliance, two 
constraints are imposed on thermal transmittance values for opaque wall 
assemblies and fenestration assemblies comprising the U<INF>o</INF> 
term, as follows:
    (a) Opaque Wall Assemblies: The opaque portion of walls with heat 
capacity (HC) less than 7 Btu/ft<SUP>2</SUP><bullet> deg.F shall have an 
overall thermal transmittance (U<INF>ow</INF>) not greater than the 
value specified in Figure 5.5-4. Procedures, specified in section 5.3, 
shall be used to determine acceptable combinations of materials that 
meet the required value.
    (b) Fenestration Assemblies: The overall thermal transmittance 
(U<INF>of</INF>) of fenestration assemblies shall not exceed 0.81 Btu/
h<bullet>ft\2\<bullet> deg.F for all locations with more than 3000 HDD65 
if the fenestration area exceeds 10% of the total wall area exposed to 
the outside air. Thermal transmittance for the fenestration shall be 
determined using the calculation procedures in Section 5.3.1 and shall 
include the effects of sash, frames, edge effects, and spacers for 
multiple-glazed units.

                5.5.6.5  Constraint on Daylighting Credit

    5.5.6.5.1  For a given orientation, daylight credit may be used in 
Equations 5.5-2 and 5.5-6 only for that portion of the fenestration that 
is less than or equal to 65% of the gross wall area of the orientation.

                     5.5.6.6  Lighting Power Density

    5.5.6.6.1  The Lighting Power Density used in calculating the 
compliance value shall be:
    (a) The building average unit Interior Lighting Power Allowance of 
the proposed design in W/ft\2\ as specified in section 3.0;
    (b) The average of the Lighting Power Budgets for all activity areas 
within 15 ft of each exterior wall based

[[Page 393]]

on the procedures set forth in section 5.3; or
    (c) The actual lighting power density of the proposed design in W/
ft\2\, either building average or average of the lighting power within 
15 ft of each exterior wall.

                    5.5.6.7  Equipment Power Density

    5.5.6.7.1  The equipment power density used in determining 
compliance shall be either:
    (a) The ``Average Receptacle Power Densities'' from Table 5.4-32, or
    (b) The actual average Equipment Unit Power Density, considering 
diversity, either building average or average in the activity areas 
within 15 ft of each exterior wall, not to exceed 1 W/ft\2\.

                        5.5.6.8  Occupancy Loads

    5.5.6.8.1  An occupancy load of 0.6 W/ft\2\ is assumed. If the 
occupancy loads in the building design are different from this value, 
use the larger value.

Sec. 435.106  Electric power and distribution.

                              6.1  General

    6.1.1  This section contains minimum requirements for all building 
electrical systems, except required emergency systems.
    6.1.2  A building shall be considered in compliance with this 
section if the minimum requirements of section 6.3 are met.

                        6.2  Principles of Design

    6.2.1  Electric Distribution Systems
    6.2.1.1  Transformers and generating units shall be sized as close 
as possible to the actual anticipated load (i.e., oversizing is to be 
avoided so that fixed thermal losses are minimized).
    6.2.1.2  Distribution of electric power at the highest practical 
voltage and load selection at the maximum power factor consistent with 
safety shall be considered. The use of distribution system transformers 
shall be minimized.
    6.2.1.3  Tenant submetering can be one of the most cost-effective 
energy conservation measures available. A large portion of the energy 
use in tenant facilities occurs simply because there is no economic 
incentive to conserve.

                        6.3  Minimum Requirements

    6.3.1  Electrical Distribution System
    6.3.1.1  All commercial or multi-family high rise residential 
buildings, having designed connected electric service over 250 kVA, 
shall have electrical energy consumption check metered on the basis of 
usage category or tenant occupancy, depending on conditions defined 
below. For buildings that are occupied by multiple tenants, the metering 
shall be per tenant, if the tenant has a connected load of 100 kVA or 
more. HVAC and service hot water systems, shared among tenants, need not 
meet this requirement but shall be separately metered.
    6.3.1.2  The electrical power feeders for each facility for which 
check-metering is required shall be by tenant and shall be subdivided in 
accordance with the following categories:
    6.3.1.2.1  Lighting and receptacle outlets;
    6.3.1.2.2  HVAC and service water heating systems and equipment; and
    6.3.1.2.3  Special occupant equipment or systems of more than 20 kW, 
such as elevators, computer rooms, kitchens, printing equipment, and 
baling presses.
    6.3.1.2.4  Exception to Section 6.3.1.2:
    (a) 10% or less of the loads on a feeder may be from another usage 
category.
    6.3.1.3  The power feeders for each category shall contain portable 
or permanent submetering prior to or within any primary or secondary 
distribution panels. Such provisions shall include a separate 
compartment or panel of adequate size and design to house the necessary 
voltage and current transformers. An accessible means of attaching 
clamp-on meters or split-core current transformers shall be provided.
    6.3.1.4  The locations of these points of measurement may be central 
or distributed throughout the building, as

[[Page 426]]

appropriate to the layout of the building. A minimum arrangement shall 
provide a safe method for access to the enclosures through which feeder 
conductors pass, and have sufficient space to attach clamp-on or split-
core current transformers. These enclosures may be separate compartments 
or combined with electrical cabinets serving another function. 
Enclosures so furnished shall be identified by available measuring 
function. A preferred arrangement would include kWh meters and demand 
registers, or a means to transmit such information to a building energy 
management control system.
    6.3.1.5  In multiple-tenant buildings, where designed connected 
electrical service is over 250 kVA, each tenant space having a total 
connected load of more than 100 kVA shall have provision made to permit 
check-metering of the total tenant load. If the building is served by a 
common HVAC system, the HVAC loads need not be check metered for each 
tenant.

                           6.3.2  Transformers

    6.3.2.1  All permanently wired transformers, that are part of the 
building electrical distribution system, except utility-owned 
transformers, shall be selected to minimize the combination of no-load, 
part-load, and full-load losses, without compromising the electrical 
system operating and reliability requirements.
    6.3.2.2  If the total capacity of the transformers exceeds 300 kVA, 
a calculation of total estimated annual operating costs of the 
transformer losses shall be made. This calculation shall be based on 
estimated hours of transformer operation at projected part-load and 
full-load conditions, and the associated transformer core and coil 
losses. If appropriate data for projecting this calculation is 
unavailable, use Form 6.3-1 ``Transformer Loss Calculation Estimate'' as 
a basis for making the estimate. The calculations made in accordance 
with this section shall be used to compare among types of transformers 
and configurations available to the designer to balance energy costs 
with necessary operating flexibility, reliability (redundancy), and 
safety. The projected annual energy costs for the losses of the selected 
arrangement shall be retained as part of the electrical design 
documentation.

    6.3.3  Electric Motors
    6.3.3.1  All permanently wired polyphase motors of 1 hp or more 
serving the building, shall meet the requirements of this section. 
Motors expected to operate more than 500 hours per year shall have a 
minimum acceptable nominal full-load motor efficiency no less than that 
shown in Table 6.3-1.
    6.3.3.1.1  Table 6.3-1 applies to motors having nominal 1200, 1800, 
or 3600 RPM; with open, drip-proof, or TEFC enclosures. Other motor 
types are exempted from the minimum efficiency requirements of these 
standards.
    6.3.3.1.2  Motor efficiency ratings shall be based on a 
statistically valid quality control procedure conforming with ANSI/IEEE 
112-1984, Test Method B (Dynamometer) using NEMA MG 1-1987 (MG 1-12.54 
and MG 1-12.55) for motors below 500 hp. For motors 500 hp and above, 
ANSI/IEEE 112-1984, Test Method B or Method F (Equivalent Circuit 
Calculation), shall be used.
    6.3.3.1.3  Values listed in Table 6.3-1 are nominal efficiencies. 
Minimum motor efficiencies shall not be less than the corresponding 
values provided in NEMA MG 1-12.54.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.208

    6.3.3.1.4  Motor efficiency shall be tested using a statistically 
valid quality control procedure conforming with the IEEE 112A, Test 
Method B (1978) (Dynmometer) fan motors E below 500 hp, or Test Method F 
(1978) (Equivalent Circuit Calculation) based on no-load measurements 
for motors 500 hp and larger.

[[Page 429]]

    6.3.3.2  Motor nameplates shall list the minimum and the nominal 
full-load motor efficiencies and the full-load power factor.
    6.3.3.3  Full-load motor power factor for three-phase motors can be 
calculated from nameplate data by Equation 6.3-1:

% Power Factor=(hp  x  745  x  100)/(nominal efficiency  x  full-load 
          amps  x  rated voltage  x 3<SUP>0.5</SUP>).

                             Equation 6.3-1

    6.3.3.4  Motor horsepower rating shall not exceed 125% of the 
calculated maximum load being served, or the next larger standard motor 
size if a standard rating does not fall within this range.
    6.3.4  Operation and Maintenance of Electrical Systems
    6.3.4.1  The designer shall specify that building owners be provided 
with written information that provides basic data relating to the 
design, operation, and maintenance of the electrical distribution system 
for the building. This shall include:
    6.3.4.1.1  a single-line diagram of the ``as-built'' building 
electrical system;

Sec. 435.107  Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems.

                              7.1  General

    7.1.1  This section contains minimum and prescriptive requirements 
for the design of HVAC systems. It is recommended that the designer 
evaluate other energy conservation measures that may be applicable to 
the proposed design.
    7.1.2  A building shall be considered in compliance with this 
section if the following conditions are met:
    7.1.2.1  The minimum requirements of Section 7.3 are met; and
    7.1.2.2  The HVAC system design complies with the prescriptive 
criteria of section 7.4. For the design of HVAC systems that incorporate 
innovative or alternate design strategies, the compliance paths set 
forth in Section 11.0 or 12.0 should be used.

                        7.2  Principles of Design

                    7.2.1  Control of Equipment Loads

    7.2.1.1  The thermal impact of equipment and appliances shall be 
minimized by use of hoods, radiation shields, or other confining 
techniques, and by use of controls to assure that such equipment is 
turned off when not needed. In addition, major heat-generating equipment 
shall, where practical, be located where it can balance other heat 
losses. For example, computer centers or kitchen areas could be located 
in the north or northwest perimeter areas of buildings depending on 
climate and prevailing wind directions. In addition, heat recovery shall 
be specifically considered for this equipment.

                        7.2.2  HVAC System Design

    7.2.2.1  Separate HVAC systems shall be considered to serve areas 
expected to operate on widely differing operating schedules or design 
conditions. For instance, systems serving office areas should generally 
be separate from those serving retail areas. When a single system serves 
a multi-tenant building, provisions shall be made to shut-off or set-
back the heating and cooling to each area independently.
    7.2.2.2  Spaces with relatively constant and weather-independent 
loads may be served with systems separate from those serving perimeter 
spaces. Areas with special temperature or humidity requirements, such as 
computer rooms, shall be served by systems separate from those serving 
areas that require comfort heating and cooling only, alternatively, 
these areas shall be served by supplementary or auxiliary systems.
    7.2.2.3  The supply of zone cooling and heating shall be sequenced 
to prevent the simultaneous operation of heating and cooling systems for 
same space. Where this is not possible due to ventilation or air 
circulation requirements, air quantities shall be reduced as much as 
possible before reheating, recooling, or mixing hot and cold air

[[Page 430]]

streams. Finally, supply air temperature shall be reset to extend 
economizer operations and to reduce reheat, recool, or mixing losses.
    7.2.2.4  Systems serving areas with significant internal heat gains 
(lighting, equipment, and people), especially interior zones with little 
or no exposure to outside air, shall be designed to take advantage of 
mild or cool weather conditions to reduce cooling energy if heat 
recovery systems are not used. These systems, called air or water 
economizers, shall be designed to provide a partial reduction in cooling 
loads even when mechanical cooling must be used to provide the remainder 
of the load. Economizer controls shall be integrated with the mechanical 
cooling (leaving air temperature) controls so that mechanical cooling is 
only operated when necessary and so supply air is not overcooled to a 
temperature below the desired supply temperature. The systems and 
controls shall be designed so that economizer operation does not 
increase heating energy use. For instance, single fan dual duct or 
multizone systems that use the same mixed air plenum for both heating 
and cooling supplies shall not be used.
    7.2.2.5  Controls shall be provided to allow systems to operate in 
an occupied mode and an unoccupied mode. In the occupied mode, controls 
shall provide for a gradually changing control point as system demands 
change from cooling to heating. In the unoccupied mode, ventilation and 
exhaust systems shall be shut off if possible, and comfort heating and 
cooling systems shall be shut off except to maintain ``setback'' space 
conditions. The setback conditions shall be the minimum and maximum 
levels required to prevent damage to the building or its contents and 
provide for a reasonable morning pick-up period. Note however that night 
setback may not conserve energy in buildings with large amounts of 
thermal mass.
    7.2.2.6  In areas where diurnal temperature swings and humidity 
levels permit, the judicious coupling of air distribution systems and 
building structural mass may be considered to allow the use of night-
time precooling to reduce the use of day-time mechanical cooling.
    7.2.2.7  High ventilation, such as in hospital operating rooms, can 
impose enormous heating and cooling loads on HVAC equipment. In these 
cases, consideration shall be given to the use of recirculating filtered 
and cleaned air, rather than 100% outside air, and pre-heating outside 
air with solar systems or reclaimed heat from other sources.

                     7.2.3  Energy Transport Systems

    7.2.3.1  Energy shall be transported by the most energy efficient 
means possible. The following options, are listed in order of efficiency 
from the (most efficient) lowest energy transport burden to the highest:
    7.2.3.1.1  Electric Wire or Fuel Pipe,
    7.2.3.1.2  Two-Phase Fluid Transfer (Steam or Refrigerant),
    7.2.3.1.3  Single-Phase Liquid Fluid (Water, Glycol, Etc.), and
    7.2.3.1.4  Air.
    7.2.3.2  The distribution system shall be selected to complement 
other system parameters such as control strategies, storage 
capabilities, and conversion and utilization system efficiencies.

                         7.2.3.3  Steam Systems

    7.2.3.3.1  Provisions for seasonal or ``non-use time'' shutdown 
shall be incorporated.
    7.2.3.3.2  The venting of steam and ingestion of air shall be 
minimized with the design directed toward full vapor performance.
    7.2.3.3.3  Subcooling shall generally be prevented.
    7.2.3.3.4  Condensate shall be returned to boilers or source devices 
at the highest possible temperature.

                         7.2.3.4  Water Systems

    7.2.3.4.1  Design flow quantity shall be minimized by designing for 
the maximum practical temperature differential.
    7.2.3.4.2  Flow quantity shall be varied with load where possible.
    7.2.3.4.3  Designs shall be for lowest practical pressure rise (or 
drop).
    7.2.3.4.4  Operating and idle control modes shall be provided.

[[Page 431]]

    7.2.3.4.5  When locating equipment, the critical pressure path shall 
be identified and the runs sized for minimum practical pressure drop.

                          7.2.3.5  Air Systems

    7.2.3.5.1  Air flow quantity shall be minimized by careful load 
analysis and an effective distribution system. If the psychometric 
nature of the application allows, the supply air quantity shall vary 
with the sensible load (i.e., VAV systems). The fan pressure requirement 
shall be held to the lowest practical value. Fan pressure shall be 
avoided as a source for control power.
    7.2.3.5.2  Each fan system shall be designed and controlled to 
reduce mechanical cooling requirements by taking advantage of favorable 
weather conditions.
    7.2.3.5.3  ``Normal'' and ``idle'' control modes shall be provided 
for the fan systems as well as the psychometric systems.
    7.2.3.5.4  Duct run distances shall be as short as possible, and the 
runs on the critical pressure path sized for minimum practical pressure 
drop.

                         7.2.4  Radiant Heating

    7.2.4.1  Radiant heating systems shall be considered in lieu of 
convective or all-air heating systems to heat areas which experience 
infiltration loads in excess of two (2) air changes per hour at design 
heating conditions.
    7.2.4.2  Radiant heating systems should be considered for areas with 
high ceilings, for spot heating, and for other applications where 
radiant heating may be more energy efficient than convective or all-air 
heating systems.

                         7.2.5  Energy Recovery

    7.2.5.1  Systems that recover energy should be considered when 
rejected fluid is of adequate temperature and a simultaneous need for 
energy exists for a significant number of operating hours.

Weather Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
based on the same 99% and 2.5% values (or statistically similar 
annualized values such as 0.2% winter and 0.5% summer) may be used.
    7.3.1.3.1  Exception to Section 7.3.1.3:

least one of the following sources:
    7.3.1.8.1  Actual information based on the intended use of the 
building;
    7.3.1.8.2  Published data from manufacturers' technical publications

    7.3.1.10  Pick-up Loads. Transient loads such as warm-up or cool-
down loads that occur after off-hour setback or shutoff, may be 
calculated from basic principles, based on the heat capacity of the 
building and its contents, the degree of setback, and desired recovery 
time, or may be assumed to be up to 30% for heating and 10% for cooling 
of the steady-state design loads.

                   7.3.2  System and Equipment Sizing

Sec. 435.108  Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment.

                              8.1  General

    8.1.1  This section contains minimum requirements for fundamental to 
good practice and/or the minimum acceptable state-of-the-art in energy 
efficient HVAC equipment.
    8.1.2  A building shall be considered in compliance with this 
section if the minimum requirements of Section 8.3 are met.

                        8.2  Principles of Design

    8.2.1  The rate of energy input(s) and the heating or cooling 
output(s) of all HVAC products shall be ascertained. This information 
shall be based on equipment in new condition, and shall cover full load, 
partial load, and standby conditions. The information shall also include 
performance data for modes of equipment operation and at ambient 
conditions as specified in the minimum equipment performance 
requirements below.

                          8.2.2  Source Systems

    8.2.2.1  To allow for HVAC equipment operation at the highest 
efficiencies, conversion devices shall be matched to load increments, 
and operation of modules shall be sequenced. Oversized or large scale 
systems shall never be used to serve small seasonal loads (e.g., a large 
heating boiler to serve a summer service water heating load). Specific 
``low load'' units shall be incorporated in the design where prolonged 
use at minimal capacities is expected.
    8.2.2.2  Storage techniques should be used to level or distribute 
loads that vary on a time or spatial basis to allow operation of a 
device at maximum (full-load) efficiency.
    8.2.2.3  All equipment shall be the most efficient (or highest COP) 
practical, at both design and reduced capacity (part-load) operating 
conditions.
    8.2.2.4  Fluid temperatures for heating equipment shall be as low as 
practical and for cooling equipment as high as practical, while meeting 
loads and minimizing flow quantities.

                        8.3  Minimum Requirements

                       8.3.1  Equipment Efficiency

    8.3.1.1  Minimum Equipment Efficiency. Equipment shall have a 
minimum efficiency at the specified rating conditions, not less than the 
values shown in Tables 8.3-1 through 8.3-10. Minimum efficiencies for 
equipment using chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) refrigerants reflect the 
assumption that the use of certain refrigerants may be restricted 
because of ozone layer depletion concerns.
    8.3.1.2  Data furnished by the equipment supplier or certified under 
a nationally-recognized certification program or rating procedure may be 
used to satisfy these requirements.
    8.3.1.3  Integrated Part-Load Value (IPLV) is the descriptor for 
part-load efficiency for certain types of equipment. The IPLVs are found 
in the referenced ARI Standards. Compliance with minimum efficiency 
requirements specified for certain HVAC equipment shall include 
compliance with part-load requirements as well as standard or full-load 
requirements.
    8.3.1.4  If nationally-recognized test procedures for combined 
equipment are not available, efficiencies for service water heating 
shall be determined using data provided by equipment and component 
manufacturers, employing reasonable assumptions concerning uncertain 
parameters.
    8.3.1.5  Omission of minimum performance requirements for certain 
classes of HVAC equipment does not preclude use of such equipment where 
appropriate.

             8.3.2  Field Assembled Equipment and Components

    8.3.2.1  Where components, such as indoor or outdoor coils, from 
more than one manufacturer are used as parts of a cooling or heating 
unit, it shall be the responsibility of the system designer to specify 
component efficiencies, which when combined will provide equipment that 
is in compliance with the requirements of these standards, based on data 
provided by the component manufacturers.
    8.3.2.2  Total on-site energy input to the equipment shall be 
determined by combining the energy inputs to all

[[Page 443]]

components, elements, and accessories including but not limited to 
compressor(s), internal circulating pump(s), condenser-air fan(s), 
evaporative-condenser cooling water pump(s), purge devices, viscosity 
control heaters, and controls.
    8.3.2.3  Heat-Operated Water Chilling Package. Double-effect, heat-
operated water chilling packages shall be used in lieu of single-effect 
equipment, due to their higher efficiency, except where the energy input 
is from low temperature waste-heat or non-depletable energy sources.

                        8.3.3  Equipment Controls

    8.3.3.3  Heat pumps equipped with supplementary resistance heaters 
for comfort heating shall be installed with a control to prevent heater 
operation when the heating load can be met by the heat pump. A two-stage 
room thermostat, that controls the supplementary heat on its second 
stage, will meet this requirement. Supplementary heater operation is 
permitted where it can be shown that supplementary heating reduces 
energy use. Supplementary heater operation is permitted during short 
transient periods of less than 15 minutes during defrost cycles.
    8.3.3.3.1  Controls shall provide a means of activating the 
supplementary heat source on an emergency basis and a visible indicator 
shall be provided to indicate the emergency heat status.
    8.3.3.4  Cooling Equipment Auxiliary Controls. Evaporator coil 
frosting and excessive compressor cycling at part-load conditions shall 
not be controlled by use of either hot gas by-pass or evaporator 
pressure regulator control.

                    8.3.4  Comfort Heating Equipment

    8.3.4.1  The designer shall obtain data and information from the 
manufacturer of electric resistance comfort heating equipment regarding 
full-load and part-load energy consumption of the heating equipment over 
the range of voltages at which the equipment is intended to operate. All 
auxiliaries required for the operation of the heater equipment such as, 
but not limited to fans, pumps, viscosity control heaters, fuel handling 
equipment, and blowers shall be included in the energy input data 
provided by the manufacturer(s).

                           8.3.5  Maintenance

    8.3.5.1  Provisions shall be made to provide necessary preventive 
maintenance information to maintain efficient operation of all HVAC 
equipment.

    9.1.1  This section contains minimum and prescriptive requirements 
for the design of Service Water Heating Systems.
    9.1.2  A building shall be considered in compliance with this 
section if the following conditions are met:
    9.1.2.1  The minimum requirements of section 9.3 are met; and
    9.1.2.2  The Service Water Heating System design complies with the 
prescriptive criteria of section 9.4.

                        9.2  Principles of Design

    9.2.1  Showerheads shall be designed to provide and maintain user 
comfort and energy savings. They should not use removable flow 
restricting inserts to meet flow limitation requirements.
    9.2.2  Point of use water heaters shall be considered where their 
use will reduce energy consumption and is life cycle cost effective.
    9.2.3  High temperature condensate, when returned to condensation 
pump tanks or other vented tanks, will have a certain portion flashed 
into steam, thus wasting energy. To conserve this energy, a heat 
exchanger shall be considered for use in the condensate return line to 
heat or preheat the service water, cool the condensate, and prevent 
flashing.
    9.2.4  Storage may be used to optimize heat recovery when the flow 
of heat to be recovered is out of phase with the demand for heated 
water, or when energy use for water heating can be shifted to take 
advantage of off-peak rates.

                        9.3  Minimum Requirements

                        9.3.1  Sizing of Systems

    9.3.1.1  Service water heating system design loads for the purpose 
of sizing and selecting systems shall be determined in accordance with 
the procedures described in chapter 54 of the ASHRAE Handbook, 1987 HVAC 
Systems and Applications Volume, or a similar computation procedure.

                       9.3.2  Equipment Efficiency

    9.3.2.1  All water heaters and hot water storage tanks shall meet 
the criteria of Table 9.3-1. Where multiple criteria are listed, all 
criteria shall be met. Where no criteria are provided, no requirements 
need be met.

[[Page 457]]

    9.3.2.1.1  Exception to section 9.3.2.1
    (a) storage water heaters and hot water storage tanks having more 
than 500 gallons of storage capacity need not meet the heat loss (HL) 
requirements of Table 9.3-1 if the tank surface area is thermally 
insulated to R-12.5 and if a standing pilot light is not used.
    9.3.2.2  Heat Traps. Storage water heaters not equipped with 
integral heat traps and having vertical pipe risers shall be installed 
with heat traps on both the inlet and outlets. The heat trap shall be 
installed directly, or as close as possible to the outlet fittings. 
Circulating systems need not employ heat traps.
    9.3.2.2.1  A heat trap may take the form of a bent piece of tubing 
that forms a loop of 360 degrees; an arrangement of pipe fittings, such 
as elbows, connected so that the inlet and outlet piping make vertically 
upward runs just before turning downward to connect to the water 
heater's inlet and outlet fittings; a commercially available heat trap; 
or any other type that effectively restricts the natural tendency of hot 
water to rise in the vertical pipe during standby periods.
    9.3.2.2.2  When the water heater outlet is directly horizontal out 
of the tank, or is piped with an elbow on the vertical outlet and then 
downward, this piping arrangement itself is effectively a heat trap and 
a separate heat trap is not then needed.

                        9.3.3  Piping Insulation

    9.3.3.1  For circulating systems, piping insulation shall conform to 
the requirements of Table 7.3-1 or an equivalent level as calculated in 
accordance with Equation 7.3-1.
    9.3.3.2  For non-circulating systems, the first 8 ft of piping from 
a storage system that is maintained at a constant temperature shall be 
insulated in accordance with Table 7.3-1, or an equivalent level as 
calculated in accordance with Equation 7.3-1. Systems without a heat 
trap to prevent circulation due to natural convection shall be 
considered circulating systems.

                             9.3.4  Controls

    9.3.4.1  Temperature. Service water heating systems shall be 
equipped with temperature controls capable of adjustment from 90  deg.F 
to a temperature setting compatible with intended use, except for 
systems serving residential dwelling units may be equipped with controls 
capable of adjustment down to 110  deg.F only. (See ASHRAE Handbook, 
1987 Systems and Applications Volume, Chapter 54, Table 3).
    9.3.4.1.1  Where temperatures higher than 120  deg.F are required at 
certain outlets for a particular intended use, separate remote heaters 
or booster heaters shall be installed for those outlets unless it can be 
shown by calculation that either energy is not saved by the application 
of this requirement or that the total cost over the life of the 
equipment is not reduced.
    9.3.4.1.2  Circulating Hot Water Systems and Heated Pipes. Systems 
designed to maintain temperatures in hot water pipes, including 
circulating hot water systems and heat tape on water pipes, shall be 
equipped with automatic controls that can be set to turn off the system 
when hot water is not required.

  9.3.5  Equipment and Control Requirements for the Conservation of Hot 
                                  Water

    9.3.5.1  Showers used for other than safety reasons shall limit the 
maximum hot water discharge to 2.75 gpm when tested according to ANSI 
A112.18.1M-1979, ``Finished and Rough Brass Plumbing Fixtures''. The 
designer shall evaluate the use of lower flow showerheads than 2.75 gpm, 
particularly for heavily used facilities. Removable flow restricting 
inserts shall not be used in showerheads to meet this criterion. When 
flow restricting inserts are used as a component part of a showerhead, 
they shall be mechanically retained at the point of manufacture. 
[Mechanically retained means a pushing or pulling force to remove the 
flow restricting insert at 8 pounds or more.] This requirement shall not 
apply to showerheads that will cause water to leak significantly from 
areas other than the spray face, if the flow restricting insert were 
removed.
    9.3.5.2  Lavatories in public restrooms, with the exception of 
lavatories for physically handicapped persons, shall be equipped with 
devices that:
    9.3.5.2.1  Limit the flow of hot water to either:
    (a) A maximum of 0.5 gpm;

[[Page 458]]

    (b) 0.75 gpm if a device or fitting is used that limits the period 
of water discharge, such as a foot switch, fixture occupancy sensor; or
    (c) 2.5 gpm if equipped with a self-closing valve;
    9.3.5.2.2  Either be equipped with a foot switch or occupancy sensor 
or similar device or limit delivery with a self-closing valve or a foot 
switch to a maximum of 0.25 gallons of hot water for circulating 
systems;
    9.3.5.2.3  Limits delivery with a self-closing valve or a foot 
switch to a maximum of 0.50 gallons for non-circulating systems; and
    9.3.5.2.4  Limits the outlet temperature to a maximum 110  deg.F.

                          9.3.6  Swimming Pools

    9.3.6.1  Pool Heaters. All pool heaters shall meet the criteria of 
Table 9.3-1 and be equipped with a readily accessible ``on-off'' switch 
to allow system shut-off without adjusting the thermostat setting and, 
when applicable, allow restarting without manually relighting the pilot 
light.
    9.3.6.2  Pool Covers. Outdoor heated swimming pools shall be 
equipped with a pool cover. However, pools deriving over 70% of the 
energy for heating from non-depletable sources or from recovery of 
energy that would otherwise be wasted (computed over an operating 
season) need not be equipped with pool covers.
    9.3.6.3  Time Switches. Time switches shall be installed on all 
swimming pool pumps and all electric swimming pool heaters. These 
switches shall allow for the shutdown of heaters during hours of peak 
utility demand except as is necessary in peak period operation to 
maintain water in a clear and sanitary condition in keeping with 
applicable public health standards.
    9.3.6.3.1  Exceptions to section 9.3.5.3:
    (a) Where public health standards require 24 hour operation of 
pumps; and
    (b) Pumps are required to operate solar pool heating systems.

    9.4  Service Hot Water Heating Systems--Prescriptive Compliance 
                               Alternative

    9.4.1  Combination Service Water Heating/Space Heating Equipment

    9.4.1.1  Water heaters used for combination service water and space 
heating shall meet the appropriate minimum efficiency requirements of 
both section 8.3 and 9.3.
    9.4.1.2  Combination space heating and service water heating 
equipment shall only be used when at least one of the following 
conditions is met:
    9.4.1.2.1  where the annual space heating energy use is less than 
50% of the annual service water heating energy use;
    9.4.1.2.2  where the energy input or storage volume of the combined 
boiler or water heater is less than twice the size of the smaller of the 
separate boilers or water heaters otherwise required;
    9.4.1.2.3  where calculations show that the combined system uses no 
more energy than separate systems that meet the requirements of sections 
8.3 and 9.3; or
    9.4.1.2.4  where the input to the combined boiler is less than 
150,000
Btu/h.
    9.4.1.3  Combination function equipment (space heating, service 
water heating, cooling, etc.) shall comply with minimum efficiency 
requirements in accordance with nationally recognized test procedures. 
Where such procedures are not available for particular equipment 
designs, compliance shall be determined based on the function 
representing the maximum annual energy consumption, using data provided 
by equipment and component manufacturers.

             9.4.2  Additional Equipment Efficiency Measures

    9.4.2.1  Electric Water Heaters. In applications where water 
temperatures not greater than 145  deg.F are required, an economic 
evaluation shall be made on the potential benefit of using an electric 
heat pump water heater(s) instead of electric resistance water 
heater(s).

[[Page 459]]

The analysis shall compare the extra costs of the heat pump unit with 
the benefits in reduced energy costs, less increased maintenance costs, 
over the estimated service life of the heat pump water heater.
    9.4.2.1.1  Exception to section 9.4.2.1:
    (a) Electric resistance water heaters used in conjunction with site-
recovered or non-depletable energy sources or off-peak heating with 
thermal storage.
    9.4.2.2  Gas-Fired Water Heaters. All gas-fired storage water 
heaters that use indoor air for combustion or draft hood dilution and 
that are installed in a conditioned room shall be equipped with a vent 
damper unless the water heater is already so equipped. Unless the water 
heater has an available electrical supply, the installation of such a 
vent damper shall not require an electrical connection. The vent damper 
shall be listed as meeting appropriate ANSI standards and shall be 
installed in accordance with manufacturer's instructions and local 
codes.
    9.4.2.2.1  Exception to section 9.4.2.2:
    (a) where the cost of the damper exceeds the value of reduced energy 
costs over the damper's lifetime.

       9.4.3  Use of Waste Heat, Solar Energy, and Thermal Storage

    9.4.3.1  An evaluation shall be made of the potential for the use of 
condenser heat, waste energy, solar energy, or off-peak heating with 
thermal storage to reduce water heating energy cost.
    9.4.3.2  Storage shall be used to optimize heat recovery when the 
flow of heat to be recovered is out of phase with the demand for heated 
water, or when energy use for water heating can be shifted to take 
advantage of off-peak rates.

Sec. 435.110  Energy management.

                              10.1  General

    10.1.1  This section contains minimum requirements for building 
energy management systems. It describes the energy measurement, control, 
testing and documentation that shall be provided to the building owner. 
The intent is to minimize energy use by providing the building operator 
with design, construction and equipment data, along with a means of 
testing the completed facility.
    10.1.2  A building shall be considered in compliance with this 
section if the minimum requirements of Section 10.3 are met.

                       10.2  Principles of Design

                10.2.1  Energy Management Control Systems

    10.2.1.1  An energy management control system is critical to the 
effective management of building energy. Energy management systems 
require measurements at key points in the building system and must be 
capable of part-load operation recognition and be equipped with controls 
to match system capacity to load demands.
    10.2.1.2  Controls cannot correct inadequate source equipment, 
poorly selected components, or mismatched systems. Energy efficiency 
requires a design that is optimized by realistic loads prediction, 
careful system selection, and full control provisions.

                10.2.2  Building Operating Documentation

    10.2.2.1  The building construction drawings and specifications must 
show system types, sizes, performance criteria, controls, and materials 
intended for use prior to construction. The system designer shall 
provide or specify that documentation be provided for the education and 
guidance of the building operator showing the actual elements that have 
been installed, how they have been installed, how they performed during 
testing, and how they operate as a system in the completed facility. 
Since minimum energy use is the ultimate goal, operating procedures are 
one of the major factors in controlling energy use in buildings. The 
activities of building occupants and operators can result in differences 
as great as two to one in the energy consumption of essentially similar 
buildings. While neither the designer nor these standards can control 
the way the building is actually operated, the designer shall contribute 
to the education and guidance of the building

[[Page 460]]

operator by including this documentation in the contract specifications.
    10.2.2.2  The building operator shall be provided with the 
following:
    10.2.2.2.1  As-built drawings and specifications;
    10.2.2.2.2  Operating manuals with a schematic diagram, sequence of 
operation and system operating criteria for each and all systems 
installed;
    10.2.2.2.3  Where the building systems are complex, a comprehensive 
balancing and testing program and report to demonstrate the energy 
performance capabilities of the system; and
    10.2.2.2.4  Maintenance manuals with complete information for all 
major components in the facility.

                       10.3  Minimum Requirements

    10.3.1  Each distinct utility-provided energy service shall be 
metered. This shall apply to central and individual tenant meters. Such 
meters shall be located, or arranged, so that the meter can be visually 
monitored.
    10.3.2  Each distinct commercially-provided energy service shall 
have a system to measure and record the amount of energy being 
delivered, based on the energy content.
    10.3.3  The energy delivery systems shall be arranged to allow 
individual measurement of occupant lighting and outlet services, 
production processes, auxiliary systems, service water heating, space 
heating, space cooling, and HVAC delivery systems.
    10.3.4  Provisions shall be made for the measurement of energy 
inputs and outputs (flow, temperature, pressure, etc.) to determine 
equipment energy consumption and/or installed performance capabilities 
and efficiencies of all heating, cooling, and HVAC delivery systems 
equipment, greater than 20 kVA or 60,000 Btu/h energy input.

               10.3.5  Energy Measurement lnstrumentation

    10.3.5.1  In buildings or tenant areas with electric service greater 
than 150 kVA or fuel use greater than 500,000 Btu/h, energy use shall be 
measured for electrical lighting, miscellaneous power outlets, HVAC 
systems and equipment, service hot water, and process loads and when the 
peak use of:
    10.3.5.1.1  Production processes, including manufacturing, 
computers, laundries, kitchens, etc., is greater than 100 kVA or 300,000 
Btu/h;
    10.3.5.1.2  Auxiliary systems and service water heating is greater

Sec. 435.111  Building energy cost compliance alternative.

                              11.1  General

    11.1.1  This section provides an alternative compliance path that 
allows greater flexibility in the design of energy efficient buildings 
using an annual energy cost method. Energy cost is used as the common 
denominator in determining compliance. Using unit costs rather than 
units of energy or power such as Btu, kWh or kW allows the energy use 
contribution of different fuel sources at different times to be added 
and compared. This path allows for innovation in designs, materials, and 
equipment, such as daylighting, passive solar heating, heat recovery, 
better zonal temperature control, thermal storage, and other 
applications of off-peak electrical energy, that cannot be adequately 
evaluated by the prescriptive or system performance alternatives found 
in sections 3.4, 3.5, 5.4, 5.5, and 7.4. This compliance path is 
intended for design comparisons only and is not intended to be used to 
either predict, document, or verify annual energy consumption or annual 
energy costs.
    11.1.2  The Building Energy Cost Compliance Alternative is to be 
used in lieu of the prescriptive or system performance methods and in 
conjunction with the minimum requirements found in sections 3.3, 4.3, 
5.3, 6.3, 7.3, 8.3, 9.3 and 10.3.

[[Page 463]]

    11.1.3  Compliance. Compliance under this method requires detailed 
energy analyses of the entire Proposed Design, referred to as the Design 
Energy Consumption; an estimate of annual energy cost for the proposed 
design, referred to as the Design Energy Cost; and comparison against an 
Energy Cost Budget. Compliance is achieved when the estimated Design 
Energy Cost is less than or equal to the Energy Cost Budget (see Figure 
11-1). This section provides instructions for determining the Energy 
Cost Budget and for calculating the Design Energy Consumption and Design 
Energy Cost. The Energy Cost Budget shall be determined through the 
calculation of monthly energy consumption and energy cost of a Prototype 
or Reference Building design configured to meet the requirements of 
sections 3.0 through 10.0.

[[Page 464]]

[[Page 465]]

    11.1.4  Designers are encouraged to employ the Building Energy Cost 
Budget compliance method set forth in this section for evaluating 
proposed design alternatives in preference to using the prescriptive/
system methods. The Building Energy Cost Budget establishes the relative 
effectiveness of each design alternative in energy cost savings, 
providing an energy cost basis upon which the building owner and 
designer may select one design over another. This Energy Cost Budget is 
the highest allowable calculated Energy Cost Budget for a specific 
building design. Other alternative designs are likely to have lower 
annual energy costs and life cycle costs than those that minimally meet 
the Energy Cost Budget.
    11.1.5  The Energy Cost Budget is a numerical target for annual 
energy cost. It is intended to assure neutrality with respect to choices 
of HVAC system type, architectural design, fuel choice, etc., by 
providing a fixed, repeatable budget target that is independent of any 
of these choices wherever possible (i.e., for the prototype buildings). 
The Energy Cost Budget for a given building size and type will vary only 
with climate, the number of stories, and the choice of simulation tool. 
The specifications of the prototypes are necessary to assure 
repeatability, but have no other significance. They are not recommended 
energy conserving practice, or even physically reasonable practice for 
some climates or buildings, but represent a reasonable worst case of 
energy cost resulting from compliance with the spirit and the letter of 
sections 3.0 through 10.0.

          11.2  Determination of the Annual Energy Cost Budget

    11.2.1  The annual Energy Cost Budgets shall be determined in 
accordance with the Prototype Building Method in section 11.2.5, or the 
Reference Building Method in section 11.2.5. Both methods calculate an 
annual Energy Cost by summing the 12 monthly Energy Cost Budgets. Each 
monthly Energy Cost Budget is the product of the monthly Building Energy 
Consumption of each type of energy used multiplied by the monthly Energy 
Cost per unit of energy for each type of energy used.
    11.2.2  The Energy Cost Budget shall be determined in accordance 
with Equation 11-1 as follows:

ECB=ECB<INF>jan</INF>+ . . . ECB<INF>m</INF>+ . . . +ECB<INF>dec</INF>

                              Equation 11-1

Based on:

ECB<INF>m</INF>=BECON<INF>m1</INF> x ECOS<INF>m1</INF>+ . . . 
          +BECON<INF>mi</INF>  x  ECOS<INF>mi</INF>

                              Equation 11-2

Where:

ECB=The annual Energy Cost Budget
ECB<INF>m</INF>=The monthly Energy Cost Budget
BECON<INF>mi</INF>=The monthly Budget Energy Consumption of the 
          i<SUP>th</SUP> type of energy
ECOS<INF>mi</INF>=The monthly Energy Cost, per unit of the 
          i<SUP>th</SUP> type of energy

    11.2.3  The monthly Energy Cost Budget shall be determined using 
current rate schedules or contract prices available at the building site 
for all non-depletable types of energy purchased. These costs shall 
include demand charges, rate blocks, time of use rates, interruptable 
service rates, delivery charges, taxes, and all other applicable rates 
for the type, location, operation, and size of the proposed design. The 
monthly Budget Energy Consumption shall be calculated from the first day 
through the last day of each month, inclusive.
    11.2.4  The Energy Cost Budget, Design Energy Consumption and Design 
Energy Cost calculations are applicable only for determining compliance 
with these standards. They are not predictions of actual energy 
consumption or costs of the proposed building after construction. Actual 
experience will differ from these calculations due to variations such as 
occupancy, building operation and maintenance, weather, energy use not 
covered by these standards, changes in energy rates between design of 
the building and occupancy, and precision of the calculation tool.

                  11.2.5  Prototype Building Procedure

    11.2.5.1  The Prototype Building procedure shall be used for all 
building types listed below. For mixed-use buildings the Energy Cost 
Budget is derived by allocating the floor space of each building type 
within the floor space of the prototype building. For

[[Page 466]]

buildings not listed below, the Reference Building procedure of section 
11.2.5 shall be used.
    11.2.5.1.1  Prototype buildings include:
    (a) Assembly;
    (b) Office (Business);
    (c) Retail (Mercantile);
    (d) Warehouse (Storage);
    (e) School (Educational);
    (f) Hotel/Motel;
    (g) Restaurant;
    (h) Health/Institutional; and
    (i) Multi-Family.

  11.2.5.2  Use of the Prototype Building to Determine the Energy Cost 
                                 Budget

    11.2.5.2.1  Determine the building type of the Proposed Design using 
the categories in section 11.2.5.1. Using the appropriate Prototype 
Building characteristics from Tables 11-1 through 11-8, the building 
shall be simulated using the same gross floor area and number of floors 
for the Prototype Building as in the Proposed Design.
    11.2.5.2.3  The form, orientation, occupancy and use profiles for 
the Prototype Building shall be fixed as described in section 11.5.3. 
Envelope, lighting, other internal loads and HVAC systems and equipment 
shall meet the prescriptive or system requirements of section 3.0 
through 10.0 and are standardized inputs.

                    11.2.6  Reference Building Method

    11.2.6.1  The Reference Building procedure shall be used only when 
the Proposed Design cannot be represented by one or a combination of the 
Prototype Building listed in section 11.2.5.1 or the assumptions for the 
Prototype Building in section 11.5, such as occupancy and use-profiles, 
do not reasonably represent the Proposed Design.

  11.2.6.2  Use of the Reference Building to Determine the Energy Cost 
                                 Budget

    11.2.6.2.1  Each floor shall be oriented in the same manner for the 
Reference Building as in the Proposed Design. The form, gross and 
conditioned floor areas of each floor and the number of floors shall be 
the same as in the Proposed Design. All other characteristics, such as 
lighting, envelope and HVAC systems and equipment, shall meet the 
prescriptive/system requirements of section 3.0 through 10.0.

            11.2.7  Calculation Procedure and Simulation Tool

    11.2.7.1  The Prototype or Reference Buildings shall be modeled 
using the criteria of section 11.5 and section 11.6. The modeling shall 
use a climate data set appropriate for both the site and the complexity 
of the energy conserving features of the design. ASHRAE Weather Year for 
Energy Calculations (WYEC) data or bin weather data shall be a default 
choice.

 11.3  Determination of the Design Energy Consumption and Design Energy 
                                  Cost

    11.3.1  The Design Energy Consumption shall be calculated by 
modeling the Proposed Design using the same methods, assumptions, 
climate data, and simulation tool as were used to establish the Energy 
Cost Budget, except as explicitly stated in 11.5. The Design Energy Cost 
shall be calculated per Equation 11-3. If the Proposed Design includes 
cogeneration or non-depletable energy sources designed for the sale of 
energy off-site, then energy cost and income resulting from outside 
sales shall not be used to reduce the Design Energy Costs. Such systems 
shall be modeled as operating to supply energy needs of the Proposed 
Design only.

DECOS=DECOS<INF>jan</INF>+ . . . DECOS<INF>m</INF> . . . . 
          +DECOS<INF>dec</INF>

                              Equation 11-3

Based on:
DECOS<INF>m</INF>=DECON<INF>m1</INF> x ECOS<INF>m1</INF>+ . . . 
          +DECON<INF>mi</INF> x ECOS<INF>mi</INF>

                              Equation 11-4

Where:
DECOS=The annual Design Energy Cost
DECOS<INF>m</INF>=The monthly Design Energy Cost
ICON<INF>mi</INF>=The monthly Design Energy Consumption of the 
          i<SUP>th</SUP> type of energy
ECOS<INF>mi</INF>=The monthly Energy Cost per unit of the i<SUP>th</SUP> 
          type of energy

    The DECON<INF>mi</INF> shall be calculated from the first day 
through the last day of the month, inclusive.

                            11.4  Compliance

    11.4.1  If the Design Energy Cost is less than or equal to the 
Energy Cost

[[Page 467]]

Budget, and all of the minimum requirements of sections 3.0 through 10.0 
are met, the Proposed Design complies with the standards.

                  11.5  Standard Calculation Procedure

    11.5.1  The Standard Calculation Procedure consists of methods and 
assumptions for calculating the Energy Cost Budget for the Prototype or 
Reference Building and the Design Energy Consumption and Design Energy 
Cost of the Proposed Design. In order to maintain consistency between 
the Energy Cost Budget and the Design Energy Cost, the input assumptions 
to be used are stated below. These inputs shall be used to determine the 
Energy Cost Budget and the Design Energy Consumption.
    11.5.2  Prescribed assumptions shall be used without variation. 
Default assumptions shall be used unless the designer can demonstrate 
that a different assumption better characterizes the building's energy 
use over its expected life. No modified default assumptions shall be 
used in modeling both the Prototype or Reference Building and the 
Proposed Design unless the designer demonstrates clear cause to do 
otherwise. Special procedures for speculative buildings are discussed in 
section 11.5.9. Shell buildings may not use section 11.0.

                      11.5.3  Orientation and Shape

    11.5.3.1   The Prototype Building shall consist of the same number 
of stories, and gross and conditioned floor area as the Proposed Design, 
with equal area per story. The building shape shall be rectangular, with 
a 2.5:1 aspect ratio. The long dimensions of the building shall face 
East and West. This is intended to provide an energy budget that can be 
met even if there are unfavorable site constraints. The fenestration 
shall be uniformly distributed in proportion to exterior wall area.
    11.5.3.2  Floor-to-floor height for the Prototype Building shall be 
13 ft except for dwelling units in hotels/motels and multi-family high 
rise residential buildings where floor-to-floor height shall be 9.5 ft.
    11.5.3.3  The Reference Building shall consist of the same number of 
stories, and gross floor area for each story as the Proposed Design. 
Each floor shall be oriented in the same manner as the Proposed Design. 
The geometric form shall be the same as the Proposed Design.

                         11.5.4  Internal Loads

    11.5.4.1  The systems and types of energy specified in this section 
are intended only as constraints in calculating the Energy Cost Budget. 
They are not intended as either requirements or recommendations for 
either systems or the type of energy to be used in the Proposed Design 
or for calculation of Design Energy Cost.
    11.5.4.2  Internal loads for multi-family high rise residential 
buildings are presented in Table 11-1. These assumptions shall be 
prescribed assumptions. Internal loads for other building types shall be 
modeled as noted in this subsection.

                          11.5.4.2.1  Occupancy

    (a) Occupancy schedules shall be Default Assumptions. The same 
assumptions shall be made in computing Design Energy Consumption as were 
used in calculating the Energy Cost Budget.
    (b) Table 11-2, Occupancy Density, establishes the density, in 
ft\2\/person of conditioned floor area, to be used for each building 
type. Table 11-3, Building Schedule Percentage Multipliers, establishes 
the percentage of total occupants in the building by hour of the day for 
each building type.

                          11.5.4.2.2  Lighting

    (a) Interior Lighting Power Allowance (ILPA), for calculating the 
Energy Cost Budget shall be determined from section 3.0. The lighting 
power used to calculate the Design Energy Consumption shall be the 
actual adjusted power for lighting in the Proposed Design. If the 
lighting controls in the Proposed Design are more effective at saving 
energy than those required by section 3.3, the actual installed lighting 
power shall be used along with the schedules reflecting the action of 
the controls to calculate the Design Energy Consumption. This actual 
installed lighting power shall not be adjusted by the Power Adjustment 
Factors listed in Table 3.5-2.

[[Page 468]]

    (b) Lighting energy profiles are shown in Table 11-3 that establish 
the percentage of the lighting load switched-on in each Prototype or 
Reference Building by hour of the day. These profiles are default 
assumptions and can be changed when calculating the Energy Cost Budget 
to provide, for example, a 12 hour rather than an 8 hour work day.

                         11.5.4.2.3  Receptacles

    (a) Receptacle loads and profiles are default assumptions. The same 
assumptions shall be made in calculating Design Energy Consumption as 
were used in calculating the Energy Cost Budget.
    (b) Receptacle loads include all general service loads that are 
typical in a building. These loads exclude any process electrical usage 
and HVAC primary or auxiliary electrical usage. Table 11-4, Receptacle 
Power Densities, establishes the density, in W/ft\2\, to be used for 
each building type. The receptacle energy profiles shall be the same as 
the lighting energy profiles in Table 11-3. This profile establishes the 
percentage of the receptacle load that is switched on by hour of the day 
and by building type.

                   11.5.5  Building Exterior Envelope

                    11.5.5.1  Insulation and Glazing

    11.5.5.1.1  The insulation and glazing characteristics of the 
Prototype and Reference Building envelope shall be determined by using 
the first column under ``Base Case'', with no assumed overhangs for the 
appropriate Alternate Component Tables (ACP) in section 5.0, as defined 
by climate range. The insulation and glazing characteristics from this 
ACP are Prescribed Assumptions for Prototype and Reference Buildings for 
calculating the Energy Cost Budget. In calculating the Design Energy 
Consumption of the Proposed Design, the envelope characteristics of the 
Proposed Design shall be used.

                         11.5.5.2  Infiltration

    11.5.5.2.1  For Prototype and Reference Buildings, infiltration 
assumptions shall be prescribed assumptions for calculating the Energy 
Cost Budget and default assumptions for the Design Energy Consumption. 
Infiltration shall impact perimeter zones only.
    11.5.5.2.2  When the HVAC system is switched ``on'', no infiltration 
shall be assumed. When the HVAC system is switched ``off'', the 
infiltration rate for buildings with or without operable windows shall 
be assumed to be 0.038 cfm/ft\2\ of gross exterior wall. Hotels/motels 
and multi-family high rise residential buildings shall have infiltration 
rates of 0.038 cfm/ft\2\ of gross exterior wall area at all times.

              11.5.5.3  Envelope and Ground Absorptivities

    11.5.5.3.1  For Prototype and Reference Buildings, absorptivity 
assumptions shall be prescribed assumptions for computing the Energy 
Cost Budget and default assumptions for computing the Design Energy 
Consumption. The solar absorptivity of opaque elements of the building 
envelope is assumed to be 70%. The solar absorptivity of ground surfaces 
is assumed to be 80% (20% reflectivity).

                       11.5.5.4  Window Management

    11.5.5.4.1  For the Prototype and Reference Building, window 
management drapery assumptions shall be prescribed assumptions for 
setting the Energy Cost Budget. No draperies shall be the default 
assumption for computing the Design Energy Consumption. Glazing is 
assumed to be internally shaded by medium-weight draperies, closed one-
half time. The draperies shall be modeled by assuming that one-half the 
area in each zone is draped and one-half is not. If manually-operated 
draperies, shades, or blinds are to be used in the Proposed Design, the 
Design Energy Consumption shall be calculated by assuming they are 
effective over one-half the glazing area in each zone.

                            11.5.5.5  Shading

    11.5.5.5.1  For Prototype and Reference buildings and the Proposed 
Design, shading by permanent structures, terrain, and vegetation shall 
be taken into account for computing energy consumption, whether or not 
these features are located on the building site.

[[Page 469]]

A permanent fixture is one that is likely to remain for the life of the 
Proposed Design.

                   11.5.6  HVAC Systems and Equipment

    11.5.6.1  The specifications and requirements for the HVAC systems 
of the Prototype and Reference Buildings shall be those in Table 11-5, 
HVAC Systems for Prototype and Reference Buildings. For the calculation 
of the Design Energy Consumption, the HVAC systems and equipment of the 
Proposed Design shall be used.
    11.5.6.2  The systems and types of energy presented in Table 11-5 
are intended only as constraints in calculating the Energy Cost Budget. 
They are not intended as either requirements or recommendations for 
either systems or the type of energy to be used in the Proposed Building 
or for the calculation of the Design Energy Cost.

                          11.5.6.3  HVAC Zones

    11.5.6.3.1  HVAC zones for calculating the Energy Cost Budget of the 
Prototype or Reference Building shall consist of at least four perimeter 
and one interior zones per floor. Prototype Buildings shall have one 
perimeter zone facing each cardinal direction. The perimeter zones of 
Prototype and Reference Buildings shall be 15 ft in width, or one-third 
the narrow dimension of the building, when this dimension is between 30 
ft and 45 ft inclusive, or one-half the narrow dimension of the building 
when this dimension is less than 30 ft. Zoning requirements shall be a 
default assumption for calculating the Energy Cost Budget. For multi-
family high rise residential buildings, the prototype building shall 
have one zone per dwelling unit. The proposed design shall have one zone 
per unit unless zonal thermostatic controls are provided within units; 
in this case, two zones per unit shall be modeled. Building types such 
as assembly or warehouse may be modeled as a single zone if there is 
only one space.
    11.5.6.3.2  For calculating the Design Energy Consumption, no fewer 
zones shall be used than were in the Prototype and Reference Buildings. 
The zones in the simulation shall correspond to the zones provided by 
the controls in the Proposed Design. Thermally similar zones, such as 
those facing one orientation on different floors, may be grouped 
together for the purposes of either the Design Energy Consumption or 
Energy Cost Budget simulation.

           11.5.6.4  Equipment Sizing and Redundant Equipment

    11.5.6.4.1  For calculating the Energy Cost Budget of Prototype or 
Reference Buildings, HVAC equipment shall be sized to meet the 
requirements of section 7.3.2, without using any of the exceptions. The 
size of equipment shall be that required for the building without 
process loads considered. The designer shall determine the final 
equipment sizing including the process loads by separate calculations. 
Redundant and/or emergency equipment need not be simulated if it is 
controlled so that it will not be operated during normal operations of 
the building. The designer shall document the installation of process 
equipment and the size of process loads.
    11.5.6.4.2  For calculating the Design Energy Consumption, actual 
air flow rates and installed equipment size shall be used in the 
simulation, except that excess capacity provided to meet process loads 
need not be modeled if the process load was not modeled in setting 
Energy Cost Budget. Equipment sizing in the simulation of the Proposed 
Design shall correspond to the equipment actually selected for the 
design and the designer shall not use equipment sized automatically by 
the simulation tool.
    11.5.6.4.3  Redundant and/or emergency equipment need not be 
simulated if it is controlled to not be operated during normal 
operations of the building.

                      11.5.7  Service Water Heating

    11.5.7.1  The service water loads for Prototype and Reference 
Buildings are defined in terms of Btu/h per person in Table 11-6. The 
service water heating loads from Table 11-6 are prescribed assumptions 
for multi-family high rise residential buildings and default assumptions 
for all other buildings. The same service water heating load assumptions 
shall be made in calculating Design Energy Consumption as were

[[Page 470]]

used in calculating the Energy Cost Budget.
    11.5.7.2  The service water heating system, including piping losses 
for the Prototype Building, shall be modeled using the methods of the 
ASHRAE Handbook, 1987 HVAC Systems and Applications Volume using a 
system that meets all requirements of section 9.0. The service water 
heating equipment for the Prototype or Reference Building shall be 
either natural gas or 2 fuel oil, if natural gas is not available at 
the site, or an electric heat pump.
    11.5.7.3  Exception to section 11.5.7:
    11.5.7.3.1  If electric resistance service water heating is 
preferable to an electric heat pump when analyzed according to the 
criteria of section 9.3.7.1 or when service water temperatures exceeding 
145  deg.F are required for a particular application, electric 
resistance water heating may be used.

                            11.5.8  Controls

    11.5.8.1  All occupied conditioned spaces in the Prototype, 
Reference and Proposed Design Buildings in all climates shall be 
simulated as being both heated and cooled. The assumptions in this 
subsection are prescribed assumptions. If the Proposed Design does not 
include equipment for cooling or heating, the Design Energy Consumption 
shall be determined by the specifications for calculating the Energy 
Cost Budget as described in Table 11-7.
    11.5.8.2  Exceptions to section 11.5.8:
    11.5.8.2.1  If a building is to be provided with only heating or 
cooling, both the Prototype or Reference Building and the Proposed 
Design shall be simulated, using the same assumptions. If such an 
assumption is made, the analysis shall show that the building interior 
temperature meets the comfort criteria of ANSI/ASHRAE 55-1981 ``Thermal 
Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy,'' at least 98% of the 
occupied hours during the year.
    11.5.8.2.2  If warehouses are not intended to be mechanically 
cooled, both the Energy Cost Budget and Design Energy Consumption shall 
be modeled assuming no mechanical cooling; and
    11.5.8.2.3  In climates where winter design temperature (97.5% 
occurrence) is greater than 59  deg.F, space heating need not be 
modeled.
    11.5.8.3  Space temperature controls for the Prototype or Reference 
Building, except multi-family high rise residential buildings shall be 
set at 70  deg.F for space heating and 75  deg.F for space cooling with 
a deadband per section 7.3.4.5. The system shut off during off-hours 
shall be according to the schedule in Table 11-3, except that the 
heating system shall cycle on if any space should drop below the night 
setback setting of 55  deg.F. There shall be no similar setpoint during 
the cooling season. Lesser deadband ranges may be used in calculating 
the Design Energy Consumption.
    11.5.8.3.1  Exceptions to section 11.5.8.3:
    (a) Setback shall not be modeled in determining either the Energy 
Cost Budget or Design Energy Cost if setback is not realistic for the 
Proposed Design, such as 24 hour/day operations. Health facilities need 
not have night setback during the heating season;
    (b) Hotel/motels and multi-family high rise residential buildings 
shall have a night setback temperature of 60  deg.F from 11:00 p.m. to 
6:00 a.m. during the heating season; and
    (c) If deadband controls are not to be installed, the Design Energy 
Cost shall be calculated with both heating and cooling thermostat 
setpoints set to the same value between 70  deg.F and 75  deg.F 
inclusive, assumed to be constant for the year.
    11.5.8.3.2  For multi-family buildings, the thermostat schedule for 
the dwelling units shall be as in Table 11-8.
    (a) The Prototype Building shall use the single zone schedule. The 
Proposed Design shall use the two-zone schedule only if zonal 
thermostatic controls are provided. For Proposed Designs that use heat 
pumps employing supplementary heat, the controls used to switch on the 
auxiliary heat source during morning warm-up periods shall be simulated 
accurately. The thermostat assumptions for multi-family high-rise 
buildings are prescribed assumptions.
    11.5.8.4  When providing for outdoor air ventilation in calculating 
the Energy Cost Budget, controls shall be assumed to close the outside 
air intake to reduce the flow of outside air to 0

[[Page 471]]

cfm during setback and unoccupied periods. Ventilation using inside air 
may still be required to maintain scheduled setback temperature. Outside 
air ventilation, during occupied periods, shall be as required by ASHRAE 
Standard 62-1981, ``Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air,'' or the 
Proposed Design, whichever is greater.
    11.5.8.5  If humidification is to be used in the Proposed Design, 
the same level of humidification and system type shall be used in the 
Prototype or Reference Building. If dehumidification requires subcooling 
of supply air, then reheat for the Prototype or Reference Building shall 
be from recovered waste heat such as condenser waste heat.

                      11.5.9  Speculative Buildings

                           11.5.9.1  Lighting

    11.5.9.1.1  The interior lighting power allowance (ILPA) for 
calculating the Energy Cost Budget shall be determined from Table 3.4-1. 
The Design Energy Consumption may be based on an assumed adjusted 
lighting power for future lighting improvements.
    (a) The assumption about future lighting power used to calculate the 
Design Energy Consumption must be documented so that the future 
installed lighting systems may be in compliance with these standards. 
Documentation must be provided to enable future lighting systems to use 
either the Prescriptive method of section 3.4 or the Systems Performance 
method of section 3.5.
    (b) Documentation for future lighting systems that use the 
Prescriptive method of section 3.4 shall be stated as a maximum adjusted 
lighting power for the tenant spaces. The adjusted lighting power 
allowance for tenant spaces shall account for the lighting power 
provided for the common areas of the building.
    (c) Documentation for future lighting systems that use the System 
Performance method of section 3.5 shall be stated as a required lighting 
adjustment. The required lighting adjustment is the whole building 
lighting power assumed in order to calculate the Design Energy 
Consumption minus the ILPA value from Table 3.4-1 that was used to 
calculate the Energy Cost Budget. When the required lighting adjustment 
is less than zero, a complete lighting design must be developed for one 
or more representative tenant spaces, demonstrating acceptable lighting 
within the limits of the assumed lighting power allowance.

                  11.5.9.2  HVAC Systems and Equipment

    11.5.9.2.1  If the HVAC system is not completely specified in the 
plans, the Design Energy Consumption shall be based on reasonable 
assumptions about the construction of future HVAC systems and equipment. 
These assumptions shall be documented so that future HVAC systems and 
equipment may be in compliance with these standards.

                        11.6  The Simulation Tool

    11.6.1  Annual energy consumption shall be simulated with a multi-
zone, 8760 hours per year building energy model. The model shall account 
for:
    11.6.1.1  The dynamic heat transfer of the building envelope such as 
solar and internal gains;
    11.6.1.2  Equipment efficiencies as a function of load and climate;
    11.6.1.3  Lighting and HVAC system controls and distribution systems 
by simulating the whole building;
    11.6.1.4  The operating schedule of the building including night 
setback during various times of the year; and
    11.6.1.5  Energy consumption information at a level necessary to 
determine the Energy Cost Budget and Design Energy Cost through the 
appropriate utility rate schedules.
    11.6.2  While the simulation tool should simulate an entire year on 
an hour by hour basis (8760 hours), programs that approximate this 
dynamic analysis procedure and provide equivalent results are 
acceptable.
    11.6.3  Simulation tools shall be selected for their ability to 
simulate accurately the relevant features of the building in question, 
as shown in the tool's documentation. For example, a single zone model 
shall not be used to simulate a large, multi-zone building, and a 
steady-state model such as the degree-day method shall not be used to 
simulate buildings when equipment efficiency or performance is 
significantly affected by the dynamic patterns of

[[Page 472]]

weather, solar radiation, and occupancy. Relevant energy-related 
features shall be addressed by a model such as daylighting, atriums or 
sunspaces, night ventilation or thermal storage, chilled water storage 
or heat recovery, active or passive solar systems, zoning and controls 
of heating and cooling systems, and ground-coupled buildings. In 
addition, models shall be capable of translating the Design Energy 
Consumption into energy cost using actual utility rate schedules with 
the coincidental electrical demand of a building. Examples of public 
domain models capable of handling such complex building systems and 
energy cost translations available in the United States are DOE-2.1C and 
BLAST 3.0 and in Canada, Energy Systems Analysis Series.
    11.6.4  All simulation tools shall use scientifically justifiable 
documented techniques and procedures for modeling building loads, 
systems, and equipment. The algorithms used in the program shall have 
been verified by comparison with experimental measurements, loads, 
systems, and equipment.

Sec. 435.112  Building energy compliance alternative.

                              12.1  General

    12.1  This section provides an alternative path for compliance with 
the standards that allow for greater flexibility in the design of energy 
efficient buildings using an annual energy target method. This path, as 
does the path used in section 11.0, provides an opportunity for the use 
of innovative designs, materials, and equipment such as daylighting, 
passive solar heating, heat recovery, and thermal storage as well as 
other applications of off-peak electrical energy where they cannot be 
adequately evaluated by the prescriptive or system performance methods 
found in sections 3.4, 3.5, 5.4, 5.5, 7.4., and 9.4.
    12.1.2  The Building Energy Use Budget Target alternative may be 
used as an option to the Building Energy Cost Budget method in section 
11.0 and is to be used in lieu of the prescriptive and system 
performance methods and in conjunction with sections 3.3, 4.3, 5.3, 6.3, 
7.3, 8.3, 9.3 and 10.3.
    12.1.3  Compliance under this section is demonstrated by showing 
that the calculated annual energy usage for the Proposed Design is less 
than or equal to a calculated Energy Use Budget. (See Figure 12-1). A 
life-cycle cost economic analysis is required to evaluate alternative 
fuel sources and energy reduction strategies. The procedures in this 
chapter are intended only for establishing design compliance, and are 
not intended to be used either to predict, document or verify annual 
energy consumption or annual energy costs.

[[Page 489]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.238



[[Page 490]]

    12.1.4  Compliance under the Building Energy Use Budget method 
requires a detailed energy analysis, using a conventional simulation 
tool, of the Proposed Design. A life-cycle cost analysis shall be used 
to select the fuel source for the HVAC systems, service hot water, and 
process loads from available alternatives. The Annual Energy Consumption 
of the Proposed Design with the life-cycle cost-effective fuel selection 
is calculated to determine the modeled energy consumption, called the 
Design Energy Use.
    12.1.5  The Design Energy Use is defined as the energy that is 
consumed within the five foot line of a proposed building per 
ft<SUP>2</SUP> over a 24 hour day, 365-day year period and specified 
operating hours. The calculated Design Energy Use is then compared to a 
calculated Energy Use Budget.
    12.1.6  Compliance. The Energy Use Budget is determined by 
calculating the annual energy usage for a Reference or Prototype 
Building that is configured to comply with the provisions of section 
11.0 for such buildings, except that the fuel source(s) of the Prototype 
or Reference Building shall be the same life-cycle cost-effective 
source(s) selected for the Proposed Design. If the Design Energy Use is 
less than or equal to the Energy Use Budget then the proposed design 
complies with these standards.
    12.1.7  This section provides instructions for determining the 
Design Energy Use and for calculating the Energy Use Budget. The Energy 
Use Budget is the highest allowable calculated annual energy consumption 
for a specified building design. Designers are encouraged to design 
buildings whose Design Energy Use is lower than the Energy Use Budget. 
Incorporated in this section is an optional life-cycle cost economic 
analysis procedure that may be used by the designer to examine the 
economic feasibility of all energy design alternatives and to produce a 
more optimum design.

             12.2  Determination of the Annual Energy Budget

    12.2.1  The Energy Use Budget shall be calculated for the 
appropriate Prototype or Reference Building in accordance with the 
procedures prescribed in section 11.2 with the following exceptions: The 
Energy Use Budget shall be stated in units of Btu/ft<SUP>2.</SUP> yr and 
the simulation tool shall segregate the calculated energy consumption by 
fuel type producing an Energy Use Budget for each fuel (the fuel 
selections having been made by a life cycle cost analysis in determining 
the proposed design).
    12.2.2  The Energy Use Budget (EUB) is calculated similarly for the 
Reference or Prototype Building using the following equation:

EUB=EUB<INF>1</INF> x f<INF>1</INF>+EUB<INF>2</INF> x f<INF>2</INF>+ . . 
. . . +EUB<INF>i</INF> x f<INF>i</INF>

                              Equation 12-1

Where EUB<INF>1</INF>, EUB<INF>2</INF>, . . . EUB<INF>i</INF> are the 
calculated annual energy targets for each fuel used in the Reference or 
Prototype building and f<INF>1</INF>, f<INF>2</INF>, . . . f<INF>i</INF> 
are the energy conversion factors given in Table 12-1. In lieu of case 
by case calculation of the Energy Use Budget, the designer may construct 
Energy Use Budget tables for the combinations of energy source(s) that 
may be considered in a set of project designs, such as electric heating, 
electric service water, and gas cooling or oil heating, gas service 
water and electric cooling. The values in such optional Energy Use 
Budget tables shall be equal to or less than the corresponding Energy 
Use Budgets calculated on a case by case basis according to this 
section. Energy Use Budget tables shall be constructed to correspond to 
the climatic regions and building types in accordance with provisions 
for Prototype or Reference Building models in section 11.0 of these 
standards.

[[Page 492]]

              12.3  Determination of the Design Energy Use

    12.3.1  The Design Energy Use shall be calculated by modeling the 
Proposed Design using the same methods, assumptions, climate data, and 
simulation tool as were used to establish the Energy Use Budget, but 
with the design features that will be used in the final building design. 
The simulation tool used shall segregate the calculated energy 
consumption by fuel type giving an annual Design Energy Use for each 
fuel. The sum of the Design Energy Uses multiplied by the fuel 
conversion factors in Table 12-1 yields the Design Energy Use for the 
proposed design:

DEU=DEU<INF>1</INF> x f<INF>1</INF>+DEU<INF>2</INF> x f<INF>2</INF>+ . . 
          . . +DEU<INF>i</INF>  x f<INF>i</INF>

                              Equation 12-2

Where f<INF>1</INF>, f<INF>2</INF>, . . . f<INF>i</INF> are the fuel 
conversion factors in Table 12-1.

      12.3.2  Required Life Cycle Cost Analysis for Fuel Selection

    12.3.2.1  Fuel sources selected for the Proposed Design and 
Prototype or Reference buildings shall be determined by considering the 
energy cost and other costs and benefits that occur during the expected 
economic life of the alternative.
    12.3.2.2  The designer shall use the procedures set forth in subpart 
A of 10 CFR part 436 to make this determination. The fuel selection life 
cycle cost analysis shall include the following steps:
    12.3.2.2.1  Determine the feasible alternatives for energy sources 
of the Proposed Design's HVAC systems, service hot water, and process 
loads.
    12.3.2.2.2  Model the Proposed Design including the alternative HVAC 
and service water systems and conduct an annual energy analysis for each 
fuel source alternative using the simulation tool specified in this 
section. The annual energy analysis shall be computed on a monthly basis 
in conformance with section 11.0 of these standards with the exception 
that all process loads shall be included in the calculation. Separate 
the output of the analysis by fuel type.
    12.3.2.2.3  Determine the unit price of each fuel using information 
from the utility or other reliable local source. During rapid changes in 
fuel prices it is recommended that an average fuel price for the 
previous twelve months be used in lieu of the current price. Calculate 
the annual energy cost of each energy source alternative in accordance 
with procedures in section 11.0 for the Design Energy Cost. Estimate the 
initial cost of the HVAC and service water systems and other initial 
costs such as energy distribution lines and service connection fees 
associated with each fuel source alternative. Estimate other costs and 
benefits for each alternative including, but not necessarily limited to, 
annual maintenance and repair, periodic and one time major repairs and 
replacements and salvage of the energy and service water systems. Cost 
estimates shall be prepared using professionally recognized cost 
estimating tools, guides and techniques.
    12.3.2.2.4  Perform a life cycle cost analysis using the procedure 
specified in section 12.3.2.
    12.3.2.2.5  Compare the total life cycle cost of each energy source 
alternative. The alternative with the lowest total life-cycle cost shall 
be chosen as the energy source for the proposed design.

                            12.4  Compliance

    12.4.1  Compliance with this section is demonstrated if the Design 
Energy Use is equal to or less than the Energy Use Budget.

DEU<ls-thn-eq>EUB

                              Equation 12-3

    12.4.2  The energy consumption shall be measured at the building 
five foot line for all fuels. Energy consumed from non-depletable energy 
sources and heat recovery systems shall not be included in the Design 
Energy Use calculations. The thermal efficiency of fixtures, equipment, 
systems or plants in the proposed design shall be simulated by the 
selected calculation tool.

                  12.5  Standard Calculation Procedure

    12.5.1  The Standard Calculation Procedure consists of methods and 
assumptions for calculating the Energy Use Budgets for Prototype and 
Reference Buildings and the Design Energy Use for the Proposed Design. 
In

[[Page 493]]

order to maintain consistency between the Energy Use Budgets and the 
Design Energy Use, the input assumptions stated in section 11.5 are to 
be used.
    12.5.2  The terms Energy Cost Budget and Design Energy Cost or 
Consumption used in section 11.0 correlate to Energy Use Budget and 
Design Energy Use, respectively, in section 12.0.

                        12.6  The Simulation Tool

    12.6.1  The criteria established in section 11.0 for the selection 
of a simulation tool shall be followed when using the compliance path 
prescribed in section 12.0.

                 12.7  Life Cycle Cost Analysis Criteria

    12.7.1  The following life cycle cost criteria applies to the fuel 
selection requirements of this chapter and to option life cycle cost 
analyses performed to evaluate energy conservation design alternatives. 
The fuel source(s) selection shall be made in accordance with the 
requirements of subpart A of 10 CFR part 436. The implementation 
calculations for the methodology of subpart A of 10 CFR part 436 is 
provided in National Bureau of Standards Handbook 135 entitled ``Life 
Cycle Cost Manual for the Federal Energy Management Program.'' When 
performing life cycle cost analyses of optional energy conservation 
opportunities the designer may use the life cycle cost procedures of 
subpart A of 10 CFR part 436 or OMB Circular A-94 or an equivalent 
procedure that meets the assumptions listed below:
    12.7.1.1  The economic life of the Prototype Building and Proposed 
Design shall be 25 years. Anticipated replacements or renovations of 
energy related features and systems in the Prototype or Reference 
Building and Proposed Design during this period shall be included in 
their respective life cycle cost calculations.
    12.7.1.2  The designer shall follow established professional cost 
estimating practices when determining the costs and benefits associated 
with the energy related features of the Prototype or Reference Building 
and Proposed Design.
    12.7.1.3  All costs shall be expressed in current dollars. General 
inflation shall be disregarded. Differential escalation of prices 
(prices estimated to rise faster or slower than general inflation) for 
energy used in the life cycle cost calculations shall be those in effect 
at the time of the life cycle cost calculations as published by the 
Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration.
    12.7.1.4  The economic effects of taxes, depreciation and other 
factors not consistent with the practices of subpart A of 10 CFR part 
436 shall not be included in the life cycle cost calculation.

Sec. 435.300  Purpose.

    (a) This subpart establishes voluntary energy conservation 
performance standards for new residential buildings. The voluntary 
energy conservation performance standards are designed to achieve the 
maximum practicable improvements in energy efficiency and increases in 
the use of non-depletable sources of energy.
    (b) Voluntary energy conservation performance standards prescribed 
under this subpart shall be developed solely as guidelines for the 
purpose of providing technical assistance for the design of energy 
conserving buildings, and shall be mandatory only for the design of

Sec. 435.303  Requirements for the design of a Federal residential building.

    (a) The head of each Federal agency responsible for the construction 
of Federal residential buildings shall establish an energy consumption 
goal for each building to be designed or constructed by or for the 
agency.
    (b) The energy consumption goal for a Federal residential building 
shall be a total point score derived by using the micro-computer program 
and user manual entitled ``Conservation Optimization Standard for 
Savings in Federal Residences (COSTSAFR),'' unless the head of the 
Federal agency shall establish more stringent requirements for that 
agency.
    (c) The head of each Federal agency shall adopt such procedures as 
may be necessary to ensure that the design of a Federal residential 
building is not less energy conserving than the energy consumption goal 
established for the building.


<R05>
Sec. 435.304  The COSTSAFR Program.

    (a) The COSTSAFR Program (Version 3.0) provides a computerized 
calculation procedure to determine the most effective set of energy 
conservation measures, selected from among the measures included within 
the Program that will produce the practicable optimum life cycle cost 
for a type of residential building in a specific geographic location. 
The most effective set of energy conservation measures is expressed as a 
total point score that serves as the energy consumption goal.
    (b) The COSTSAFR Program (Version 3.0) also prints out a point 
system that identifies a wide array of different energy conservation 
measures indicating how many points various levels of each measure would 
contribute to reaching the total point score of the energy consumption 
goal. This enables a Federal agency to use the energy consumption goal 
and the point system in the design and procurement procedures so that 
designers and builders can pick and choose among different combinations 
of energy conservation measures to meet or exceed the total point score 
required to meet the energy consumption goal.
    (c) The COSTSAFR Program (Version 3.0) operates on a micro-computer 
system that uses the MS DOS operating system and is equipped with an 
8087 co-processor.

callable in less than ten years, as most recently reported by the 
Federal Reserve Board; and
    (2) Subject to a ceiling of 10 percent and a floor of three percent 
the real discount rate shall be a 12 month average of the composite 
yields of all outstanding U.S. Treasury bonds neither due nor callable 
in less than ten years, as most recently reported by the Federal Reserve 
Board, adjusted to exclude estimated increases in the general level of 
prices consistent with projections of inflation in the most recent 
Economic Report of the President's Council of Economic Advisors.
    (b) Each Federal agency shall assume that energy prices will change 
at rates projected by DOE's Energy Information Administration and 
published by NIST annually no later than the beginning of the fiscal 
year in the Annual Supplement to the Life Cycle Costing Manual for the 
Federal Energy Management Program, in tables consistent with the 
discount rate determined by DOE under paragraph (a) of this section, 
except that--
    (1) If the Federal agency is using component prices under 
Sec. 436.14(c), that agency may use corresponding component escalation 
rates provided by the energy or water supplier.
    (2) For Federal buildings in foreign countries, the Federal agency 
may use a ``reasonable'' escalation rate.
    (c) Each Federal agency shall assume that the price of energy or 
water in the base year is the actual price charged for energy or water 
delivered to the Federal building and may use actual component prices as 
provided by the energy or water supplier.
    (d) Each Federal agency shall assume that the appropriate study 
period is as follows:
    (1) For evaluating and ranking alternative retrofits for an existing 
Federal building, the study period is the expected life of the retrofit, 
or 25 years from the beginning of beneficial use, whichever is shorter.
    (2) For determining the life cycle costs or net savings of mutually 
exclusive alternatives for a given building energy system or building 
water system (e.g., alternative designs for a particular system or size 
of a new or retrofit building energy system or building water system), a 
uniform study period for all alternatives shall be assumed which is 
equal to--
    (i) The estimated life of the mutually exclusive alternative having 
the longest life, not to exceed 25 years from the beginning of 
beneficial use with appropriate replacement and salvage values for each 
of the other alternatives; or
    (ii) The lowest common multiple of the expected lives of the 
alternative, not to exceed 25 from the beginning of beneficial use with 
appropriate replacement and salvage values for each alternative.
    (3) For evaluating alternative designs for a new Federal building, 
the study period extends from the base year through the expected life of 
the building or 25 years from the beginning of beneficial use, whichever 
is shorter.
    (e) Each Federal agency shall assume that the expected life of any 
building energy system or building water system is the period of service 
without major renewal or overhaul, as estimated by a qualified engineer 
or architect, as appropriate, or any other reliable source except that 
the period of service of a building energy or water system shall not be 
deemed to exceed the expected life of the owned building, or the 
effective remaining term of the

[[Page 501]]

leased building (taking into account renewal options likely to be 
exercised).
    (f) Each Federal agency may assume that investment costs are a lump 
sum occurring at the beginning of the base year, or may discount future 
investment costs to present value using the appropriate present worth 
factors under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (g) Each Federal agency may assume that energy or water costs and 
non-fuel or non-water operation and maintenance costs begin to accrue at 
the beginning of the base year or when actually projected to occur.
    (h) Each Federal agency may assume that costs occur in a lump sum at 
any time within the year in which they are incurred.
    (i) This section shall not apply to calculations of estimated simple 
payback time under Sec. 436.22 of this part.

Sec. 436.15  Formatting cost data.

    In establishing cost data under Secs. 436.16 and 436.17 and 
measuring cost effectiveness by the modes of analysis described by 
Sec. 436.19 through Sec. 436.22, a format for accomplishing the analysis 
which includes all required input data and assumptions shall be used. 
Subject to Sec. 436.18(b), Federal agencies are encouraged to use 
worksheets or computer software referenced in the Life Cycle Cost Manual 
for the Federal Energy Management Program.


<R05>
Sec. 436.16  Establishing non-fuel and non-water cost categories.

    (a) The relevant non-fuel cost categories are--
    (1) Investment costs;
    (2) Non-fuel operation and maintenance cost;
    (3) Replacement cost; and
    (4) Salvage value.
    (b) The relevant non-water cost categories are--
    (1) Investment costs;
    (2) Non-water operation and maintenance cost;
    (3) Replacement cost; and
    (4) Salvage value.
    (c) The present value of recurring costs is the product of the base 
year value of recurring costs as multiplied by the appropriate uniform 
present worth factor under Sec. 436.14, or as calculated by computer 
software indicated in Sec. 436.18(b) and used with the official discount 
rate and escalation rate assumptions under Sec. 436.14. When recurring 
costs begin to accrue at a later time, subtract the present value of 
recurring costs over the delay, calculated using the appropriate uniform 
present worth factor for the period of the delay, from the present value 
of recurring costs over the study period or, if using computer software, 
indicate a delayed beneficial occupancy date.
    (d) The present value of non-recurring cost under Sec. 436.16(a) is 
the product of the non-recurring costs as multiplied by appropriate 
single present worth factors under Sec. 436.14 for the respective years 
in which the costs are expected to be incurred, or as calculated by 
computer software provided or approved by DOE and used with the official 
discount rate and escalation rate assumptions under Sec. 436.14.

<R05>
Sec. 436.17  Establishing energy or water cost data.

    (a) Each Federal agency shall establish energy costs in the base 
year by multiplying the total units of energy used in the base year by 
the price per unit of energy in the base year as determined in 
accordance with Sec. 436.14(c).
    (b) When energy costs begin to accrue in the base year, the present 
value of energy costs over the study period is the product of energy 
costs in the base year as established under Sec. 436.17(a), multiplied 
by the appropriate modified uniform present worth factor adjusted for 
energy price escalation for the applicable region, sector, fuel type, 
and study period consistent with Sec. 436.14, or as calculated by 
computer software provided or approved by DOE and used with the official 
discount rate and escalation rate assumptions under Sec. 436.14. When 
energy costs begin to accrue at a later time, subtract the present value 
of energy costs over the delay, calculated using the adjusted, modified 
uniform present worth factor for the period of delay, from the present 
value of energy costs over the

[[Page 502]]

study period or, if using computer software, indicate a delayed 
beneficial occupancy date.
    (c) Each Federal agency shall establish water costs in the base year 
by multiplying the total units of water used in the base year by the 
price per unit of water in the base year as determined in accordance 
with Sec. 436.14(c).
    (d) When water costs begin to accrue in the base year, the present 
value of water costs over the study period is the product of water costs 
in the base year as established under Sec. 436.17(a), or as calculated 
by computer software provided or approved by DOE and used with the 
official discount rate and assumptions under Sec. 436.14. When water 
costs begin to accrue at a later time, subtract the present value of 
water costs over the delay, calculated using the uniform present worth 
factor for the period of delay, from the present value of water costs 
over the study period or, if using computer software, indicate a delayed 
beneficial occupancy date.

<R05>
Sec. 436.18  Measuring cost-effectiveness.

    (a) In accordance with this section, each Federal agency shall 
measure cost-effectiveness by combining cost data established under 
Secs. 436.16 and 436.17 in the appropriate mode of analysis as described 
in Sec. 436.19 through Sec. 436.22.
    (b) Federal agencies performing LCC analysis on computers shall use 
either the Federal Buildings Life Cycle Costing (FBLCC) software 
provided by DOE or software consistent with this subpart.
    (c) Replacement of a building energy or water system with an energy 
or water conservation measure by retrofit to an existing Federal 
building or by substitution in the design for a new Federal building 
shall be deemed cost-effective if--
    (1) Life cycle costs, as described by Sec. 436.19, are estimated to 
be lower; or
    (2) Net savings, as described by Sec. 436.20, are estimated to be 
positive; or
    (3) The savings-to-investment ratio, as described by Sec. 436.21, is 
estimated to be greater than one; or
    (4) The adjusted internal rate of return, as described by 
Sec. 436.22, is estimated to be greater than the discount rate as set by 
DOE.
    (d) As a rough measure, each Federal agency may determine estimated 
simple payback time under Sec. 436.23, which indicates whether a 
retrofit is likely to be cost effective under one of the four 
calculation methods referenced in Sec. 436.18(c). An energy or water 
conservation measure alternative is likely to be cost-effective if 
estimated payback time is significantly less than the useful life of 
that system, and of the Federal building in which it is to be installed.
    (e) Mutually exclusive alternatives for a given building energy or 
water system, considered in determining such matters as the optimal size 
of a solar energy system, the optimal thickness of insulation, or the 
best choice of double-glazing or triple-glazing for windows, shall be 
compared and evaluated on the basis of life cycle costs or net savings 
over equivalent study periods. The alternative which is estimated to 
result in the lowest life cycle costs or the highest net savings shall 
be deemed the most cost-effective because it tends to minimize the life 
cycle cost of Federal building.
    (f) When available appropriations will not permit all cost-effective 
energy or water conservation measures to be undertaken, they shall be 
ranked in descending order of their savings-to-investment ratios, or 
their adjusted internal rate of return, to establish priority. If 
available appropriations cannot be fully exhausted for a fiscal year by 
taking all budgeted energy or water conservation measures according to 
their rank, the set of energy or water conservation measures that will 
maximize net savings for available appropriations should be selected.
    (g) Alternative building designs for new Federal buildings shall be 
evaluated on the basis of life cycle costs. The alternative design which 
results in the lowest life cycle costs for a given new building shall be 
deemed the most cost-effective.

Sec. 436.19  Life cycle costs.

    Life cycle costs are the sum of the present values of--
    (a) Investment costs, less salvage values at the end of the study 
period;
    (b) Non-fuel operation and maintenance costs:
    (c) Replacement costs less salvage costs of replaced building 
systems; and
    (d) Energy and/or water costs.

<R05>
Sec. 436.20  Net savings.

    For a retrofit project, net savings may be found by subtracting life 
cycle costs based on the proposed project from life cycle costs based on 
not having it. For a new building design, net savings is the difference 
between the life cycle costs of an alternative design and the life cycle 
costs of the basic design.


<R05>
Sec. 436.21  Savings-to-investment ratio.

    The savings-to-investment ratio is the ratio of the present value 
savings to the present value costs of an energy or water conservation 
measure. The numerator of the ratio is the present value of net savings 
in energy or water and non-fuel or non-water operation and maintenance 
costs attributable to the proposed energy or water conservation measure. 
The denominator of the ratio is the present value of the net increase in 
investment and replacement costs less salvage value attributable to the 
proposed energy or water conservation measure.

<R05>
Sec. 436.22  Adjusted internal rate of return.

    The adjusted internal rate of return is the overall rate of return 
on an energy or water conservation measure. It is calculated by 
subtracting 1 from the nth root of the ratio of the terminal value of 
savings to the present value of costs, where n is the number of years in 
the study period. The numerator of the ratio is calculated by using the 
discount rate to compound forward to the end of the study period the 
yearly net savings in energy or water and non-fuel or non-water 
operation and maintenance costs attributable to the proposed energy or 
water conservation measure. The denominator of the ratio is the present 
value of the net increase in investment and replacement costs less 
salvage value attributable to the proposed energy or water conservation 
measure.

Sec. 436.23  Estimated simple payback time.

    The estimated simple payback time is the number of years required 
for the cumulative value of energy or water cost savings less future 
non-fuel or non-water costs to equal the investment costs of the 
building energy or water system, without consideration of discount 
rates.

Sec. 436.24  Uncertainty analyses.

    If particular items of cost data or timing of cash flows are 
uncertain and are not fixed under Sec. 436.14, Federal agencies may 
examine the impact of uncertainty on the calculation of life cycle cost 
effectiveness or the assignment of rank order by conducting additional 
analyses using any standard engineering economics method such as 
sensitivity and probabilistic analysis. If additional analysis casts 
substantial doubt on the life cycle cost analysis results, a Federal 
agency should consider obtaining more reliable data or eliminating the 
building energy or water system alternative.

                               Contracting

    Source:60 FR 18334, Apr. 10, 1995, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 436.30  Purpose and scope.

    (a) General. This subpart provides procedures and methods which 
apply to Federal agencies with regard to the award and administration of 
energy savings performance contracts awarded within five years of April 
10, 1995. This subpart applies in addition to the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation at Title 48

[[Page 504]]

of the CFR and related Federal agency regulations. The provisions of 
this subpart are controlling with regard to energy savings performance 
contracts notwithstanding any conflicting provisions of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation and related Federal agency regulations.
    (b) Utility incentive programs. Nothing in this subpart shall 
preclude a Federal agency from--
    (1) Participating in programs to increase energy efficiency, 
conserve water, or manage electricity demand conducted by gas, water, or 
electric utilities and generally available to customers of such 
utilities;
    (2) Accepting financial incentives, goods, or services generally 
available from any such utility to increase energy efficiency or to 
conserve water or manage electricity demand; or
    (3) Entering into negotiations with electric, water, and gas 
utilities to design cost-effective demand management and conservation 
incentive programs to address the unique needs of each Federal agency.
    (c) Promoting competition. To the extent allowed by law, Federal 
agencies should encourage utilities to select contractors for the 
conduct of utility incentive programs in a competitive manner to the 
maximum extent practicable.
    (d) Interpretations. The permissive provisions of this subpart shall 
be liberally construed to effectuate the objectives of Title VIII of the 
National Energy Conservation Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 8287-8287c.

<R05>
Sec. 436.31  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart--
    Act means Title VIII of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act.
    Annual energy audit means a procedure including, but not limited to, 
verification of the achievement of energy cost savings and energy unit 
savings guaranteed resulting from implementation of energy conservation 
measures and determination of whether an adjustment to the energy 
baseline is justified by conditions beyond the contractor's control.
    Building means any closed structure primarily intended for human 
occupancy in which energy is consumed, produced, or distributed.
    Detailed energy survey means a procedure which may include, but is 
not limited to, a detailed analysis of energy cost savings and energy 
unit savings potential, building conditions, energy consuming equipment, 
and hours of use or occupancy for the purpose of confirming or revising 
technical and price proposals based on the preliminary energy survey.
    DOE means Department of Energy.
    Energy baseline means the amount of energy that would be consumed 
annually without implementation of energy conservation measures based on 
historical metered data, engineering calculations, submetering of 
buildings or energy consuming systems, building load simulation models, 
statistical regression analysis, or some combination of these methods.
    Energy conservation measures means measures that are applied to an 
existing Federally owned building or facility that improves energy 
efficiency, are life-cycle cost-effective under subpart A of this part, 
and involve energy conservation, cogeneration facilities, renewable 
energy sources, improvements in operation and maintenance efficiencies, 
or retrofit activities.
    Energy cost savings means a reduction in the cost of energy and 
related operation and maintenance expenses, from a base cost established 
through a methodology set forth in an energy savings performance 
contract, utilized in an existing federally owned building or buildings 
or other federally owned facilities as a result of--
    (1) The lease or purchase of operating equipment, improvements, 
altered operation and maintenance, or technical services; or
    (2) The increased efficient use of existing energy sources by 
cogeneration or heat recovery, excluding any cogeneration process for 
other than a federally owned building or buildings or other federally 
owned facilities.
    Energy savings performance contract means a contract which provides 
for the performance of services for the design, acquisition, 
installation, testing, operation, and, where appropriate,

[[Page 505]]

maintenance and repair of an identified energy conservation measure or 
series of measures at one or more locations.
    Energy unit savings means the determination, in electrical or 
thermal units (e.g., kilowatt hour (kwh), kilowatt (kw), or British 
thermal units (Btu)), of the reduction in energy use or demand by 
comparing consumption or demand, after completion of contractor-
installed energy conservation measures, to an energy baseline 
established in the contract.
    Facility means any structure not primarily intended for human 
occupancy, or any contiguous group of structures and related systems, 
either of which produces, distributes, or consumes energy.
    Federal agency has the meaning given such term in section 551(1) of 
Title 5, United States Code.
    Preliminary energy survey means a procedure which may include, but 
is not limited to, an evaluation of energy cost savings and energy unit 
savings potential, building conditions, energy consuming equipment, and 
hours of use or occupancy, for the purpose of developing technical and 
price proposals prior to selection.
    Secretary means the Secretary of Energy.


<R05>
Sec. 436.32  Qualified contractors lists.

    (a) DOE shall prepare a list, to be updated annually, or more often 
as necessary, of firms qualified to provide energy cost savings 
performance services and grouped by technology. The list shall be 
prepared from statements of qualifications by or about firms engaged in 
providing energy savings performance contract services on questionnaires 
obtained from DOE. Such statements shall, at a minimum, include prior 
experience and capabilities of firms to perform the proposed energy cost 
savings services by technology and financial and performance 
information. DOE shall issue a notice annually, for publication in the 
Commerce Business Daily, inviting submission of new statements of 
qualifications and requiring listed firms to update their statements of 
qualifications for changes in the information previously provided.
    (b) On the basis of statements of qualifications received under 
paragraph (a) of this section and any other relevant information, DOE 
shall select a firm for inclusion on the qualified list if--
    (1) It has provided energy savings performance contract services or 
services that save energy or reduce utility costs for not less than two 
clients, and the firm possesses the appropriate project experience to 
successfully implement the technologies which it proposes to provide;
    (2) Previous project clients provide ratings which are ``fair'' or 
better;
    (3) The firm or any principal of the firm has neither been insolvent 
nor declared bankruptcy within the last five years;
    (4) The firm or any principal of the firm is not on the list of 
parties excluded from procurement programs under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 
9.4; and
    (5) There is no other adverse information which warrants the 
conclusion that the firm is not qualified to perform energy savings 
performance contracts.
    (c) DOE may remove a firm from DOE's list of qualified contractors 
after notice and an opportunity for comment if--
    (1) There is a failure to update its statement of qualifications;
    (2) There is credible information warranting disqualification; or
    (3) There is other good cause.
    (d) A Federal agency shall use DOE's list unless it elects to 
develop its own list of qualified firms consistent with the procedures 
in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (e) A firm not designated by DOE or a Federal agency pursuant to the 
procedures in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section as qualified to 
provide energy cost savings performance services shall receive a written 
decision and may request a debriefing.
    (f) Any firm receiving an adverse final decision under this section 
shall apply to the Board of Contract Appeals of the General Services 
Administration in order to exhaust administrative remedies.

<R05>
Sec. 436.33  Procedures and methods for contractor selection.

    (a) Competitive selection. Competitive selections based on 
solicitation of firms are subject to the following procedures--
    (1) With respect to a particular proposed energy cost savings 
performance project, Federal agencies shall publish a Commerce Business 
Daily notice which synopsizes the proposed contract action.
    (2) Each competitive solicitation--
    (i) Shall request technical and price proposals and the text of any 
third-party financing agreement from interested firms;
    (ii) Shall consider DOE model solicitations and should use them to 
the maximum extent practicable;
    (iii) May provide for a two-step selection process which allows 
Federal agencies to make an initial selection based, in part, on 
proposals containing estimated energy cost savings and energy unit 
savings, with contract award conditioned on confirmation through a 
detailed energy survey that the guaranteed energy cost savings are 
within a certain percentage (specified in the solicitation) of the 
estimated amount; and
    (iv) May state that if the Federal agency requires a detailed energy 
survey which identifies life cycle cost effective energy conservation 
measures not in the initial proposal, the contract may include such 
measures.
    (3) Based on its evaluation of the technical and price proposals 
submitted, any applicable financing agreement (including lease-
acquisitions, if any), statements of qualifications submitted under 
Sec. 436.32 of this subpart, and any other information determines to be 
relevant, the Federal agency may select a firm on a qualified list to 
conduct the project.
    (4) If a proposed energy cost savings project involves a large 
facility with too many contiguously related buildings and other 
structures at one site for proposing firms to assume the costs of a 
preliminary energy survey of all such structures, the Federal agency--
    (i) May request technical and price proposals for a representative 
sample of buildings and other structures and may select a firm to 
conduct the proposed project; and
    (ii) After selection of a firm, but prior to award of an energy 
savings performance contract, may request the selected firm to submit 
technical and price proposals for all or some of the remaining buildings 
and other structures at the site and may include in the award for all or 
some of the remaining buildings and other structures.
    (5) After selection under paragraph (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this 
section, but prior to award, a Federal agency may require the selectee 
to conduct a detailed energy survey to confirm that guaranteed energy 
cost savings are within a certain percentage (specified in the 
solicitation) of estimated energy cost savings in the selectee's 
proposal. If the detailed energy survey does not confirm that guaranteed 
energy savings are within the fixed percentage of estimated savings, the 
Federal agency may select another firm from those within the competitive 
range.
    (b) Unsolicited proposals. Federal agencies may--
    (1) Consider unsolicited energy savings performance contract 
proposals from firms on a qualified contractor list under this subpart 
which include technical and price proposals and the text of any 
financing agreement (including a lease-acquisition) without regard to 
the requirements of 48 CFR 15.503 (a) and (c); 48 CFR 15.506-2(a)(1); 
and 48 CFR 15.507(a), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4) and (b)(5).
    (2) Reject an unsolicited proposal that is too narrow because it 
does not address the potential for significant energy conservation 
measures from other than those measures in the proposal.
    (3) After requiring a detailed energy survey, if appropriate, and 
determining that technical and price proposals are adequate, award a 
contract to a firm on a qualified contractor list under this subpart on 
the basis of an unsolicited proposal, provided that the Federal agency 
complies with the following procedures--
    (i) An award may not be made to the firm submitting the unsolicited 
proposal unless the Federal agency first publishes a notice in the 
Commerce Business Daily acknowledging receipt

[[Page 507]]

of the proposal and inviting other firms on the qualified list to submit 
competing proposals.
    (ii) Except for unsolicited proposals submitted in response to a 
published general statement of agency needs, no award based on such an 
unsolicited proposal may be made in instances in which the Federal 
agency is planning the acquisition of an energy conservation measure 
through an energy savings performance contract.
    (c) Certified cost or pricing data.
    (1) Energy savings performance contracts under this part are firm 
fixed-price contracts.
    (2) Pursuant to the authority provided under section 304A(b)(1)(B) 
of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1049, the 
heads of procuring activities shall waive the requirement for submission 
of certified cost or pricing data. However, this does not exempt 
offerors from submitting information (including pricing information) 
required by the Federal agency to ensure the impartial and comprehensive 
evaluation of proposals.


<R05>
Sec. 436.34  Multiyear contracts.

    (a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, Federal agencies may 
enter into a multiyear energy savings performance contract for a period 
not to exceed 25 years, as authorized by 42 U.S.C. 8287, without funding 
of cancellation charges, if:
    (1) The multiyear energy savings performance contract was awarded in 
a competitive manner using the procedures and methods established by 
this subpart;
    (2) Funds are available and adequate for payment of the scheduled 
energy cost for the first fiscal year of the multiyear energy savings 
performance contract;
    (3) Thirty days before the award of any multiyear energy savings 
performance contract that contains a clause setting forth a cancellation 
ceiling in excess of $750,000, the head of the awarding Federal agency 
gives written notification of the proposed contract and the proposed 
cancellation ceiling for the contract to the appropriate authorizing and 
appropriating committees of the Congress; and
    (4) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the multiyear 
energy savings performance contract is subject to 48 CFR part 17, 
subpart 17.1, including the requirement that the contracting officer 
establish a cancellation ceiling.
    (b) Neither this subpart nor any provision of the Act requires, 
prior to contract award or as a condition of a contract award, that a 
Federal agency have appropriated funds available and adequate to pay for 
the total costs of an energy savings performance contract for the term 
of such contract.


<R05>
Sec. 436.35  Standard terms and conditions.

    (a) Mandatory requirements. In addition to contractual provisions 
otherwise required by the Act or this subpart, any energy savings 
performance contract shall contain clauses--

Sec. 436.103  Program goal setting.

    (a) In developing and revising plans for a projected 10-year plan 
each agency shall establish and maintain energy conservation goals in 
accordance with the requirements of this section.
    (b) Agencies shall establish three types of conservation goals:
    (1) Energy consumption goals, by fuel type by functional category 
(see appendix B).
    (2) Energy efficiency goals by fuel type by functional category (see 
appendix B).
    (3) Fuel switching goals for shifting energy use from oil and 
natural gas to other fuels in more plentiful supply from domestic 
sources (see appendix B).
    (c) General operations energy conservation goals shall be 
established by each Federal agency with the broad purpose of achieving 
reductions in total energy consumption and increased efficiency without 
serious mission degradation or unmitigated negative environmental 
impacts. Within the broad framework, each agency should seek first to 
reduce energy consumption per unit of output in each applicable 
functional category. In evaluating energy efficiency, each agency should 
select and use standards of measurement which are consistent throughout 
the planning period. Particular attention should be given to increased 
energy use efficiency in nonrenewable fuel consumption. The second focus 
of attention should be on initiatives which shift energy use from oil 
and natural gas to other fuels in more plentiful supply from domestic 
sources.


<R05>
Sec. 436.104  Energy conservation measures and standards.

    (a) Each agency shall consider for inclusion in its plan the 
measures identified in appendix C of this subpart.
    (b) The following questions should be considered in the evaluation 
of each measure:
    (1) Does this measure provide an incentive or disincentive?
    (2) What is the estimate of savings by fuel type?
    (3) What are the direct and indirect impacts of this measure?
    (4) Is this measure to be mandatory throughout the agency?
    (5) If not mandatory, under what circumstances will it be 
implemented, and who will be responsible for determining specific 
applicability?

summary of which shall be included in the general operations plan, for 
assuaging the impact of a sudden disruption in the supply of oil-based 
fuels, natural gas or electricity. Priorities for temporarily reducing 
missions, production, services, and other programmatic or

[[Page 513]]

functional activities shall be developed in accordance with paragraph 
(b) of this section. Planning for emergencies is to address both 
buildings and general operations. Provisions shall be made for testing 
emergency actions to ascertain that they are effective.
    (b) Federal agencies shall prepare emergency conservation plans for 
10 percent, fifteen percent, and 20 percent reduction compared to the 
previous fiscal year in gasoline, other oil-based fuels, natural gas, or 
electricity for periods of up to 12 months. In developing these plans, 
agencies shall consider the potential for emergency reductions in energy 
use in buildings and facilities which the agency owns, leases, or has 
under contract and by employees through increased use of car and van 
pooling, preferential parking for multipassenger vehicles, and greater 
use of mass transit. Agencies may formulate whatever additional 
scenarios they consider necessary to plan for various energy 
emergencies.
    (c) In general, Federal agencies' priorities shall go to those 
activities which directly support the agencies' primary missions. 
Secondary mission activities which must be curtailed or deferred will be 
reported to DOE as mission impacts. The description of mission impacts 
shall include estimates of the associated resources and time required to 
mitigate the effects of the reduction in energy. Other factors or 
assumptions to be used in energy conservation emergency planning are as 
follows:
    (1) Agencies will be given 15-30 days notice to implement any given 
plan.
    (2) Substitution of fuels in plentiful supply for fuels in short 
supply is authorized, if the substitution can be completed within a 3-
month period and the cost is within the approval authority of the 
executive branch.
    (3) All costs and increases in manpower or other resources 
associated with activities or projects to assuage mission impacts will 
be clearly defined in respective agency plans. One-time costs will be 
identified separately.
    (4) Confronting the emergency situation will be considered a 
priority effort and all projects and increases in operating budgets 
within the approval authority of the executive branch will be 
expeditiously considered and approved if justified.
    (d) Summary plans for agency-wide emergency conservation management 
shall be provided to DOE pursuant to Sec. 436.102(b)(2)(vi). Such 
summaries shall include:
    (1) Agency-wide impacts of energy reductions as determined in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Actions to be taken agency-wide to alleviate the energy 
shortfalls as they occur.
    (3) An assessment of agency services or production that may need to 
be curtailed or limited after corrective actions have been taken.
    (4) A summation of control and feedback mechanisms for managing an 
energy emergency situation.


<R05>
Sec. 436.106  Reporting requirements.

    (a) By July 1 of each year each Federal agency shall submit an

agency in performing functions in support of its overall mission. 
Consideration is to be given, but not limited to, the following factors: 
Number of people using energy; number of vehicles using gasoline; 
amounts of other equipment using energy; tempo of operations (one, two, 
or three shifts); the type of operations (degree of equipment or labor 
intensity); equipment fuel limitations; environmental conditions 
(tropical versus arctic, etc.); budget levels for fuel, operations, 
maintenance, and equipment acquisition; and phase-out schedule (of older 
equipment or plants which may be inefficient). After identifying these 
factors, a further analysis shall be made to identify any projected 
workload changes in the quality or quantity of these factors on a yearly 
basis up to 1990.
    (2) Based upon the analysis in (a)(1) and an evaluation of available 
information on past energy usage, a baseline of energy use by fuel type 
by functional category shall be established beginning with FY 1975. In 
addition to ``General Transportation,'' other functional categories 
should be selected to enhance energy management. Total fuel use for a 
particular activity may be allocated to the functional category for 
which the preponderance of fuel is used. Figure B-1 is an example of one 
such baseline.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.241


[[Page 516]]


    This example shows an increase in energy use, for a specific fuel 
type, during the period 1975-1981, with a further increase from 1981 to 
1984 and a leveling off and no growth from 1984-1990. A justification, 
based on factors as discussed above, shall accompany each baseline.
    (3) Thereafter, analyses should be made of the measures available 
for reducing the energy consumption profiles without adverse impact on 
mission accomplishment. Finding viable opportunities for reducing energy 
use, increasing energy efficiency and switching energy sources, will 
require consultation with specialists in the fields of operations, 
maintenance, engineering, design, and economics, and consideration of 
the measures identified in Appendix C. The DOE Federal Energy Management 
Programs Office can, upon request, provide information on where such 
resources can be located. Once these measures are identified, they are 
to be incorporated into a time-phased investment program, (using where 
appropriate, the life cycle costing factors and methodology in subpart A 
of this part). If investment and other costs for implementing a measure 
are insignificant, a Federal agency may presume that a measure is cost-
effective without further analysis. An estimate must then be made as to 
the lead time required to implement the program and realize energy 
reductions.
    Figure B-2 shows a summarized investment program, which should be 
accompanied by a detailed description of the measures, projects, and 
programs making up the total planned investments for each year. This 
summary need not be by function or fuel type.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.242

    These analyses should enable the agency to project an energy 
consumption goal, with the assumption that funds for executing the 
planned projects will be approved. Figure B-3 shows a new energy use 
profile, with planned initiatives and related investments taken into 
consideration, and the resulting goal entitled ``Energy Use With A 
Plan'' superimposed on Figure B-1. Included are the anticipated effects 
on consumption cause by improvements in energy efficiency and fuel 
switching.

[[Page 517]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC04OC91.243


    A comparison of these projections will show the energy use avoidance 
resulting from the investment program as depicted in Figure B-2. Using 
the prices of fuel contained in Appendix C to Subpart A, the dollars 
saved can be projected against the dollars invested. Life cycle costing 
methodology pursuant to subpart A, will be used to determine priorities 
for submitting individual initiatives into the appropriate budget year.
    (b) For energy efficiencies--Energy efficiency baselines and goals 
for each fuel type shall be calculated using the same consumption 
factors and similar methodology to that outlined in paragraph (a). 
Energy consumption by fuel type shall be linked to mission through the 
functional categories listed in Sec. 436.106(a)(2). This will identify a 
rate which will indicate energy efficiency trends. This linkage may be 
accomplished through the following algorithm:
    Step 1: Determine functional categories from section 436.106(a)(2) 
which best describe the Agency overall mission.
    Step 2: Determine types of fuels used to support the functions 
selected in Step 1.
    Step 3: Determine quantities of fuel consumed or planned for 
consumption over a specific period of time.
    Step 4: Determine quantity of output of function for same period of 
time used in Step 3. Quantify output in a standard measure which best 
describes functional category.
    Step 5: Determine the energy efficiency ratio by dividing quantity 
from Step 4 by quantity from Step 3.
    This ratio of fuel consumed to a unit measure of output will be used 
to develop a projection of a baseline and goals through 1990, and used 
in reporting variance. Examples of ratios that should be considered are:

    <bullet> Production or industrial process type operations

Ton of product

Cu. ft. of natural gas

    <bullet> Services, such as postal delivery

Customers served or
pounds delivered

Gallons of automotive
gasoline

    <bullet> General transportation

Passenger miles

Gallons of automotive gasoline

    <bullet> Training

Persons trained
or in training

Gallons of navy special

    Agencies shall select one or more of these ratios, which shall be 
used throughout the planning period, or use more appropriate energy 
efficiency ratios, to describe their overall functions. Figure B-4 
illustrates the planning baseline and goal resulting from this type of 
analysis.

[[Page 519]]

    (c) For fuel switching--Fuel switching goals for gasoline other oil-
based fuel and natural gas may be calculated as follows:
    Step 1: For each fiscal year, identify investments, where 
appropriate, in fuel switching from gasoline, other oil-based fuel and 
natural gas to alternate renewable or nonrenewable fuel sources.
    Step 2: Project for each fiscal year, the avoidance in the use of 
gasoline, other oil-based fuel and natural gas resulting from previous 
fuel switching investments.
    Completion of these steps will permit the formulation of charts such 
as that shown in Figure B-5.

      Appendix D to Part 436--Energy Program Conservation Elements

    (a) In all successful energy conservation programs, certain key 
elements need to be present. The elements listed below must be 
incorporated into each agency conservation program and must be reflected 
in the 10-year plan prescribed in Sec. 436.102. Those organizations that 
have already developed programs should review them to determine whether 
the present management systems incorporate these elements.
    (1) Top Management Control. Top management must have a personal and 
sustained commitment to the program, provide active direction and 
motivation, and require regular review of overall energy usage at senior 
staff meetings.
    (2) Line Management Accountability. Line managers must be 
accountable for the energy conservation performance of their 
organizations and should participate in establishing realistic goals and 
developing strategies and budgets to meet these goals.
    (3) Formal Planning. An overall 10-year plan for the period 1980-
1990 must be developed and formalized which sets forth performance-
oriented conservation goals, including the categorized reduction in 
rates of energy consumption that the program is expected to realize. The 
plan will be supplemented by guidelines enumerating specific 
conservation procedures that will be followed. These procedures and 
initiatives must be life cycle cost-effective as well as energy 
efficient.
    (4) Goals. Goals must be established in a measurable manner to 
answer questions of ``Where are we?'' ``Where do we want to go?'' ``Are 
we getting there?'' and ``Are our initiatives for getting there life 
cycle cost-effective?''
    (5) Monitoring. Progress must be reviewed periodically both at the 
agency headquarters and at local facility levels to identify program 
weakness or additional areas for conservation actions. Progress toward 
achievement of goals should be assessed, and explanations should be 
required for non-achievement or unusual variations in energy use. 
Monitoring should include personal inspections and staff visits, 
management information reporting and audits.
    (6) Using Technical Expertise. Personnel with adequate technical 
background and knowledge of programmatic objectives should be used to 
help management set technical goals and parameters for efficient 
planning and implementation of energy conservation programs. These 
technicians should work in conjunction with the line managers who are 
accountable for both mission accomplishment and energy conservation.
    (7) Employee Awareness. Employees must gain an awareness of energy 
conservation through formal training and employee information programs. 
They should be invited to participate in the process of developing an 
energy conservation program, and to submit definitive suggestions for 
conservation of energy.
    (8) Energy Emergency Planning. Every energy management plan must 
provide for programs to respond to contingencies that may occur at the 
local, state or National level. Programs must be developed for potential 
energy emergency situations calling for reductions of 10 percent, 15 
percent and 20 percent for up to 12 months. Emergency plans must be 
tested to ascertain their effectiveness.
    (9) Budgetary and Fiscal Support. Resources necessary for the energy 
conservation program must be planned and provided for, and the fiscal 
systems adjusted to support energy management investments and 
information reporting.
    (10) Environmental Considerations. Each agency shall fulfill its 
obligations under the

[[Page 522]]

National Environmental Policy Act in developing its plan.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Subtract 171,258,000 from total program allocations.
    (3) Calculate each State's formula share as follows:
    (i) Divide the number of ``Low Income'' households in each State by 
the number of ``Low Income'' households in the United States and 
multiply by 100.
    (ii) Divide the number of ``Heating Degree Days'' for each State by 
the median ``Heating Degree Days'' for all States.
    (iii) Divide the number of ``Cooling Degree Days'' for each State by 
the median ``Cooling Degree Days'' for all States, then multiply by 0.1.
    (iv) Calculate the sum of the two numbers from paragraph (b)(3)(ii) 
and (iii) of this section.
    (v) Divide the residential energy expenditures for each State by the 
number of households in the State.
    (vi) Divide the sum of the residential energy expenditures for the 
States in each Census division by the sum of the households for the 
States in that division.
    (vii) Divide the quotient from paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section 
by the quotient from paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section.

section for each State by the residential energy expenditures per low-
income household for its respective Census division.
    (ix) Divide the product from paragraph (b)(3)(viii) of this section 
for each State by the median of the products of all States.
    (x) Multiply the results for paragraph (b)(3)(i), (iv) and (ix) of 
this section for each State.
    (xi) Divide the product in paragraph (b)(3)(x) of this section for 
each State by the sum of the products in paragraph (b)(3)(x) of this 
section for all States.
    (4) Calculate each State's program allocation as follows:
    (i) Multiply the remaining funds calculated in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section by the formula share calculated in paragraph (b)(3)(xi) of 
this section,
    (ii) Add the base allocation from paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
to the product of paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section.

[[Page 526]]

    (c) Should total program allocations for any fiscal year fall below 
the total program allocations under Pub. L. 103- 332, then each State's 
program allocation shall be reduced from its allocated amount under Pub. 
L. 103-332 by the same percentage as total program allocations for the 
fiscal year fall below the total program allocations under Pub. L. 103-
332.
    (d) All data sources used in the development of the formula are 
publicly available. The relevant data is available from the Bureau of 
the Census, the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration 
and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
    (e) Should updates to the data used in the formula become available 
in any fiscal year, these changes would be implemented in the formula in 
the following program year.
    (f) DOE may reduce the program allocation for a State by the amount 
DOE determines cannot be reasonably expended by a grantee to weatherize 
dwelling units during the budget period for which financial assistance 
is to be awarded. In reaching this determination, DOE will consider the 
amount of unexpended financial assistance currently available to a 
grantee under this part and the number of dwelling units which remains 
to be weatherized with the unexpended financial assistance.
    (g) DOE may increase the program allocation of a State by the amount 
DOE determines the grantee can expend to weatherize additional dwelling 
units during the budget period for which financial assistance is to be 
awarded.
    (h) The Support Office Director shall notify each State of the 
program allocation for which that State is eligible to apply.

Sec. 440.11  Native Americans.

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Support 
Office Director may determine, after taking into account the amount of 
funds made available to a State to carry out the purposes of this part, 
that:
    (1) The low-income members of an Indian tribe are not receiving 
benefits under this part equivalent to the assistance provided to other 
low-income persons in the State under this part and
    (2) The low-income members of such tribe would be better served by 
means of a grant made directly to provide such assistance.
    (b) In any State for which the Support Office Director shall have 
made the determination referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
Support Office Director shall reserve from the sums that would otherwise 
be allocated to the State under this part not less than 100 percent, or 
more than 150 percent, of an amount which bears the same ratio to the 
State's allocation for the fiscal year involved as the population of all 
low-income Native Americans for whom a determination under paragraph (a) 
of this section has been made bears to the population of all low-income 
persons in the State.
    (c) The Support Office Director shall make the determination 
prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section in the event a State:
    (1) Does not apply within the sixty-day time period prescribed in 
Sec. 440.12(a);
    (2) Recommends that direct grants be made for low-income members of 
an Indian tribe as provided in Sec. 440.12(b)(5);
    (3) Files an application which DOE determines, in accordance with 
the procedures in Sec. 440.30, not to make adequate provision for the 
low-income members of an Indian tribe residing in the State; or
    (4) Has received grant funds and DOE determines, in accordance with 
the procedures in Sec. 440.30, that the State has failed to implement 
the procedures required by Sec. 440.16(6).
    (d) Any sums reserved by the Support Office Director pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section shall be granted to the tribal 
organization serving the individuals for whom the determination has been 
made, or where there is no tribal organization, to such other entity as 
the Support Office Director determines is able to provide adequate 
weatherization assistance pursuant to this part. Where the Support 
Office Director intends to make a grant to an organization to perform 
services benefiting more than one Indian tribe, the approval of each 
Indian tribe shall be a

[[Page 527]]

prerequisite for the issuance of a notice of grant award.
    (e) Within 30 days after the Support Office Director has reserved 
funds pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Support Office 
Director shall give written notice to the tribal organization or other 
qualified entity of the amount of funds reserved and its eligibility to 
apply therefor.
    (f) Such tribal organization or other qualified entity shall 
thereafter be treated as a unit of general purpose local government 
eligible to apply for funds hereunder, pursuant to the provisions of 
Sec. 440.13.

Sec. 440.21  Standards and techniques for weatherization.

    (a) Paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section set forth the energy 
audit procedures which apply to the grantees and subgrantees who are 
subject to the 40 percent material cost requirement in Sec. 440.18(a) of 
this part. Paragraphs (b), (d), (e), and (h) through (k) of this section 
set forth the requirements for the energy audit procedures which, if 
satisfied in the State plan, warrant approval of a State's application 
to waive the 40 percent material cost requirement in Sec. 440.18(a) of 
this part.
    (b) Only weatherization materials which are listed in appendix A and 
which meet or exceed standards prescribed in appendix A to this part 
shall be purchased with funds provided under this part, except that DOE 
may approve an unlisted material upon application from any State.
    (c) The most cost-effective weatherization materials for each 
dwelling unit shall be determined by audit procedures using the 
following formula:
    (1) The cost of fuel saved per year by installing a weatherization 
material in a dwelling unit;
    (2) Multiplied by the appropriate lifetime of the weatherization 
material; and
    (3) Divided by the cost of the weatherization material and the cost 
of the installation of the weatherization material.
    (d) The computation of the cost of fuel saved per year must take 
into account the number of heating or cooling degree days in the area of 
which the computation is being made and must otherwise use reasonable 
methods and assumptions.
    (e) The figures used for the lifetime of the materials and for the 
costs of materials and cost of the installation of the materials must be 
generally accepted in the relevant trade.
    (f) The weatherization materials which shall be installed first are 
those which are determined to be the most cost effective using the 
formula in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (g) The audit procedures used in Project Retro-Tech to determine the 
most cost-effective weatherization materials comply with this section. 
The grantee or subgrantee may use other audit procedures to determine 
the most cost-effective weatherization materials, provided that these 
procedures comply with this section and are approved by the Support 
Office Director prior to their use. A grantee or subgrantee may use 
results obtained from audits conducted under the Residential 
Conservation Service Program as part of the audit procedures which have 
been approved by the Support Office Director.
    (h) The energy audit procedures must--
    (1) Consider the rate of energy use;
    (2) Address significant heating and cooling needs;
    (3) Make provision for use of advanced diagnostic and assessment 
techniques which DOE has determined are consistent with sound 
engineering practices;
    (4) Determine energy use from actual energy bills or by generally 
accepted engineering calculations;
    (5) Consistent with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, 
determine that

[[Page 534]]

each weatherization material is cost effective by ensuring that the net 
fuel cost savings over the lifetime of such weatherization material, 
discounted to present value in accordance with paragraph (i) of this 
section, to the costs to be claimed as allowable under 
Sec. 440.18(c)(1), (2), and (7), and any other significant, related cost 
required to be included by a State, is greater than or equal to one;
    (6) Assign priorities among weatherization materials in descending 
order of their cost effectiveness ratios calculated under paragraph 
(h)(5) of this section;
    (i) After adjusting those ratios for interaction between 
architectural and mechanical weatherization materials by decreasing the 
estimated fuel cost savings for a lower priority weatherization material 
in light of fuel cost savings for a related higher priority 
weatherization material; and
    (ii) Eliminating any weatherization material if its cost 
effectiveness ratio, as adjusted under paragraph (h)(6) of this section, 
is less than one;
    (7) Determine that the total conservation investment has a positive 
rate of return by ensuring that the ratio of the cumulative net fuel 
cost savings of all weatherization materials, adjusted for interaction 
between architectural and mechanical weatherization materials if any, to 
the cumulative costs included under paragraph (h)(5) of this section and 
the costs to be claimed as allowable under Sec. 440.18(c)(9), is greater 
than or equal to one;
    (8) Identify health and safety hazards to be abated with DOE funds 
in compliance with the State's DOE-approved health and safety procedures 
under Sec. 440.16(h); and
    (9) Treat the dwelling unit as a whole system by examining its 
heating and cooling system, its air exchange system and it occupants' 
living habits and needs, and making necessary adjustments to the 
priority of weatherization materials with adequate documentation of the 
reasons for such an adjustment.
    (i) The energy audit must provide for use of the annually adjusted 
discount rate provided by DOE except that a State may keep that rate 
constant up to 5 years or may use a reasonable higher real discount 
rate. Subject to a ceiling of 10 percent and floor of 3 percent and 
subject to adjustment by DOE region for a rate of fuel cost escalation 
predicted by the DOE Energy Information Administration, DOE shall 
calculate annually the adjusted discount rate, for use under paragraph 
(h) of this section as a 12-month average of the composite yields of all 
outstanding U.S. Treasury bonds neither due nor callable in less than 10 
years, as most recently reported by the Federal Reserve, adjusted to 
exclude estimated increases in the general level of prices consistent 
with projections of inflation in the most recent Economic Report of the 
President's Council of Economic Advisers.
    (j) For typical dwelling units without unusual energy consuming 
characteristics which significantly alter typical energy usage, energy 
audits may be accomplished by using a priority list developed by 
conducting, in compliance with paragraph (h) of this section, site-
specific energy audits of a representative sample of typical dwelling 
units for each major dwelling type covered by the State's weatherization 
program. Priority lists developed in accordance with this paragraph must 
be revalidated by conducting a representative sample of site-specific 
energy audits every 5 years.
    (k) Subject to DOE approval, a State may use as a part of an energy 
audit, a list of presumptively cost effective general heat waste 
reduction weatherization materials and the circumstance under which such 
materials may be presumed cost effective without need for further audit 
justification if those materials are shown to be cost effective in 
typical dwelling units for major dwelling unit types in the State based 
on documentation of a representative number of site-specific energy 
audits.

    (iv) No undue or excessive enhancement shall occur to the value of 
the dwelling units.
    (c) In order to secure the Federal investment made under this part 
and address the issues of eviction from and sale of property receiving 
weatherization materials under this part, States may seek landlord 
agreement to placement of a lien or to other contractual restrictions;
    (d) As a condition of having assistance provided under this part 
with respect to multifamily buildings, a State may require financial 
participation, when feasible, from the owners of such buildings. Such 
financial participation shall not be reported as program income, nor 
will it be treated as if it were appropriated funds. The funds 
contributed by the landlord shall be expended in accordance with the 
agreement between the landlord and the weatherization agency.
    (e) In devising procedures under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this 
section, States should consider requiring use of alternative dispute 
resolution procedures including arbitration.
    (f) A State may weatherize shelters. For the purpose of determining 
how many dwelling units exist in a shelter, a grantee may count each 800 
square feet of the shelter as a dwelling unit or it may count each floor 
of the shelter as a dwelling unit.

constructed renewable energy facility, or a facility covered by 
paragraph (f) of this section, must occur during the inclusive period 
beginning October 1, 1993, and ending on September 30, 2003.
    (f) Conversion of non-qualified facilities. Existing non-qualified 
facilities that are converted must meet either of the following 
criteria--
    (1) A facility employing solar, wind, geothermal or biomass sources 
must be refurbished during the allowed time of first use such that the 
fair market value of any previously used property does not exceed 20% of 
the facility's total value.
    (2) A facility not employing solar, wind, geothermal or biomass 
sources must be converted in part or in whole to a qualified facility 
during the allowed time of first use.
    (g) Location. The qualified renewable energy facility must be 
located in a State.


<R05>
Sec. 451.5  Where and when to apply.

    (a) Pre-application and notification. (1) An applicant may submit at 
any time a pre-application, containing the information described in 
Sec. 451.8 (a) through (e), to obtain a preliminary and conditional 
determination of eligibility.
    (2) To assist DOE in its budget planning, the owner or operator of a 
qualified renewable energy facility is requested to provide notification 
at least 6 months in advance of when a facility is expected to be first 
used, providing projected information specified in Sec. 451.8 (a) 
through (e).
    (b) Application. (1) Except as provided by paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, an application for an incentive payment for electric energy 
generated and sold in a fiscal year must be filed during the first 
quarter (October 1 through December 31) of the next fiscal year.
    (2) For energy generated and sold in fiscal year 1994, an 
application for incentive payment must be filed on or before September 
5, 1995.

information relating to the application.
    (b) Audits. DOE may require the applicant to conduct at its own 
expense and submit an independent audit, or DOE may conduct an audit, to 
verify the number of kilowatt-hours claimed to have been generated and 
sold by the qualified renewable energy facility and for which an 
incentive payment has been requested or made.
    (c) DOE determinations. Upon evaluating the application and any 
other relevant information, DOE shall determine:
    (1) Eligibility of the applicant for receipt of an incentive 
payment, based on the criteria for eligibility specified in this part; 
and
    (2) The number of kilowatt-hours to be used in calculating the 
incentive payment, based on the sum of net electric energy generated 
from a qualified renewable energy source at the qualified renewable 
energy facility and sold during the prior fiscal year, and any accrued 
energy.
    (d) Calculating payments. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) 
of this section, incentive payments under this part shall be determined 
by multiplying the number of kilowatt-hours determined under 
Sec. 451.9(c)(2) by 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, and adjusting that 
product for inflation for each fiscal year beginning after calendar year 
1993 in the same manner as provided in section 29(d)(2)(B) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, except that in applying such provisions 
calendar year 1993 shall be substituted for calendar year 1979.
    (e) Insufficient Funds. The Assistant Secretary for Energy 
Efficiency and Renewable Energy shall determine the extent to which 
appropriated funds are available to be obligated under this program for 
each fiscal year. If funds determined to be available under the 
preceding sentence are not sufficient to make full incentive payments 
for all approved applications, DOE shall--
    (1) Make incentive payments first, and if necessary on a pro rata 
basis, to owners or operators of qualified renewable energy facilities 
using solar, wind, geothermal, and closed-loop biomass technologies;
    (2) Make incentive payments second, and if necessary on a pro rata 
basis, to owners or operators of all other qualified renewable energy 
facilities.
    (3) Treat the number of kilowatt-hours for which an incentive 
payment is not made as a result of insufficient appropriations as 
accrued energy for which subsequent application for incentive payment 
may be made.
    (f) Notice to applicant. After calculating the amount of the 
incentive payment under paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section, the 
DOE Deciding Official shall then issue a written notice of the 
determination to the applicant--
    (1) Approving the application as eligible for payment and forwarding 
a copy to the DOE Finance Office with a request to pay;
    (2) Setting forth the calculation of the approved amount of the 
incentive payment; and
    (3) Stating the amount of accrued energy, measured in kilowatt-
hours, for each qualified renewable energy facility, if any, and the 
energy source for same.
    (g) Disqualification. If the application does not meet the 
requirements of this part or some of the kilowatt-hours claimed in the 
application are disallowed as unqualified, the Deciding Official shall 
issue a written notice denying the application in whole or in part with 
an explanation of the basis for denial.


<R05>
Sec. 451.10  Administrative appeals.

    (a) In order to exhaust administrative remedies, an applicant who 
receives a notice denying an application in whole or in part shall 
appeal, on or before 45 days from date of the notice issued by the DOE 
Deciding Official, to the Office of Hearings and Appeals, 1000 
Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20585, in accordance with 
the procedures set forth in subpart C of 10 CFR part 1003.

[[Page 547]]

    (b) If an applicant does not appeal under paragraph (a) of this 
section, the determination of the DOE Deciding Official shall become 
final for DOE and judicially unreviewable.
    (c) If an applicant appeals on a timely basis under paragraph (a) of 
this section, the decision and order of the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals shall be final for DOE.
    (d) If the Office of Hearings and Appeals orders an incentive 
payment, the DOE Deciding Official shall send a copy of such order to 
the DOE Finance Office with a request to pay.

<R05>
Sec. 455.63  Cost-effectiveness testing.

    (a) This paragraph applies to calculation of the simple payback 
period of energy conservation measures.
    (1) The simple payback period of each energy conservation measure 
(except measures to shift demand, or renewable resource measures) shall 
be calculated, taking into account the interactions among the various 
measures, by dividing the estimated total cost of the measure, as 
determined pursuant to Sec. 455.62(d)(3)(ii), by the estimated annual 
cost savings accruing from the measure (adjusted for demand charges), as 
determined pursuant to Sec. 455.62(d)(3)(vi), provided that:
    (i) At least 50 percent of the annual cost savings used in this 
calculation shall be from the cost of the energy to be saved or a higher 
percent if required by a State in its State Plan pursuant to 
Sec. 455.20(u)(3); and
    (ii) No more than 50 percent of the annual cost savings used in this 
calculation shall be from other cost savings, such as those resulting 
from energy conservation maintenance and operating procedures related to 
particular energy conservation measures, or from changes in type of fuel 
used, or a lower percent if required by a State in its State Plan 
pursuant to Sec. 455.20(u)(3).
    (2) The simple payback period of each renewable resource energy 
conservation measure shall be calculated, taking into account the 
interactions among the various measures, by dividing the estimated total 
cost of the measure, as determined pursuant to Sec. 455.62(d)(3)(ii), by 
the estimated annual cost savings accruing from the measure taking into 
account at least the annual cost of the non-renewable fuels displaced 
less the annual cost of the renewable fuel, if any, and the annual cost 
of any backup non-renewable fuel needed to operate the system, adjusted 
for demand charges, as determined pursuant to Sec. 455.62(d)(3)(vi).
    (3) The simple payback period of each energy conservation measure 
designed

[[Page 562]]

to shift demand to a period of lower demand and lower cost shall be 
calculated, taking into account the interactions among the various 
measures, by dividing the estimated total cost of the measure, as 
determined pursuant to Sec. 455.62(d)(3)(ii), by the estimated annual 
cost savings accruing from the measure taking into account at least the 
annual cost of the energy used before the measure is installed less the 
estimated annual cost of the energy to be used after the measure is 
installed, adjusted for demand charges, as determined pursuant to 
Sec. 455.62(d)(3)(vi).
    (b) This paragraph applies, in addition to paragraph (a) of this 
section, if the State plan requires the cost effectiveness of an energy 
conservation measure to be determined by life-cycle cost analysis or if 
the applicant requests such an analysis.
    (1) A life-cycle cost analysis, showing a savings-to-investment 
ratio greater than or equal to one over the useful life of the energy 
conservation measure or 15 years, whichever is less, shall be conducted 
in accordance with the requirements set forth in the State Plan pursuant 
to Secs. 455.20(u)(2), 455.20(u)(3) and Sec. 455.64.
    (2) The resulting savings-to-investment ratio shall be used for the 
purpose of ranking applications.


<R05>
Sec. 455.64  Life-cycle cost methodology.

    (a) The life-cycle cost methodology under Sec. 455.63(b) of this 
part is a systematic comparison of the relevant significant cost savings 
and costs associated with an energy conservation measure over its 
expected useful life, or other appropriate study period with future cost 
savings and costs discounted to present value. The format for displaying 
life-cycle costs shall be a savings-to-investment ratio.
    (b) An energy conservation measure must be cost effective, and its 
savings-to-investment ratio must be greater than or equal to one no 
earlier than the end of the second year of the study period.
    (c) A savings-to-investment ratio is the ratio of the present value 
of net cost savings attributable to an energy conservation measure to 
the present value of the net increase in investment, maintenance and 
operating, and replacement costs less salvage value or disposal cost 
attributable to that measure over a study period.
    (d) Except for energy conservation measures to shift demand or to 
use renewable energy resources, the numerator of the savings-to-
investment ratio shall include net cost savings, appropriately 
discounted and adjusted for energy cost escalation consistent with 
paragraph (g) of this section, subject to the limitation that the cost 
of the energy to be saved shall constitute at least 50 percent of the 
net cost savings unless the State specifies a higher percent in its 
State plan pursuant to Sec. 455.20(u)(3).
    (e) With respect to energy conservation measures to shift demand or 
to use renewable energy resources, the numerator of the savings-to-
investment ratio shall be net cost savings appropriately discounted and 
adjusted for energy cost escalation consistent with paragraph (g) of 
this section.
    (f) The study period for a life-cycle cost analysis, which may not 
exceed 15 years, shall be the useful life of the energy conservation 
measure or of the energy conservation measure with the longest life (for 
purposes of ranking buildings with multiple energy conservation 
measures).
    (g) The discount rate must equal or exceed the discount rate 
annually provided by DOE under 10 CFR part 436. The energy cost 
escalation rates must not exceed those annually provided by DOE under 10 
CFR part 436.
    (h) Investment costs may be assumed to be a lump sum occurring at 
the beginning of the base year, or to the extent that there are future 
investment costs, discounted to present value.
    (i) The cost of energy and maintenance and operating costs may be 
assumed to begin to accrue at the beginning of the base year or when 
they are actually projected to occur.
    (j) It may be assumed that costs occur in a lump sum at any time 
within the year in which they are incurred.

requirements of Sec. 455.62 and that was performed prior to the 
installation of the energy conservation measures.


<R05>
Sec. 455.104  Rebates from utilities and other entities.

    (a) Grantees which receive rebates or other monetary considerations 
from utilities or other entities for installing the energy conservation 
measures funded by a grant under this part may use such funds to meet 
their cost- sharing obligations pursuant to Sec. 455.100.
    (b) Where the rebate or monetary consideration does not exceed the 
non-Federal share of the cost of the measures applied for in a grant 
application, grantees are not required to deduct the amount of the 
rebate or monetary consideration from the cost of the measures, and DOE 
does not consider such rebates or monetary considerations to be program 
income which would have to be remitted to DOE upon receipt by the 
grantee.
    (c) Where the rebate or monetary consideration does exceed the non-
Federal share of the cost of the measures applied for in a grant 
application, grantees may use the excess to fund additional measures if 
such measures have been recommended in the technical assistance report. 
If it is not possible to use the excess funding in this way, the grantee 
must reduce the cost--and DOE will reduce the Federal share--by the 
amount of the excess above the non-Federal share.

Sec. 455.130  State evaluation of grant applications.

    (a) If an application received by a State is reviewed and evaluated 
by that State and determined to be in compliance with subparts E, F, and 
J of this part, Sec. 455.130(b), any additional requirements of the 
approved State Plan, State environmental laws, and other applicable laws 
and regulations, then such application will be eligible for financial 
assistance.
    (b) Concurrent with its evaluation and ranking of grant applications 
pursuant to Sec. 455.131, the State will forward applications for 
technical assistance or for energy conservation measures for schools to 
the State school facilities agency for review and certification that 
each school application is consistent with related State programs for 
educational facilities. For hospitals the certification requirement 
applies only if there is a State requirement for it in which case the 
procedure should be described in the State Plan.


<R05>
Sec. 455.131  State ranking of grant applications.

    (a) Except as provided by Sec. 455.92 of this part, all eligible 
applications received by the State will be ranked by the State in 
accordance with its approved State Plan.
    (b) For technical assistance programs, buildings shall be ranked in 
descending priority based upon the energy conservation potential, on a 
savings percentage basis, of the building as determined in the energy 
audit or energy use evaluation pursuant to Sec. 455.20(k). Each State 
shall develop separate rankings for all buildings covered by eligible 
applications for:
    (1) Technical assistance programs for units of local government and 
public care institutions and
    (2) Technical assistance programs for schools and hospitals.
    (c) All eligible applications for energy conservation measures 
received will be ranked by the State on building-by-building or a 
measure-by-measure basis. If a State ranks on a building-by-building 
basis, several buildings may be ranked as a single building if the 
application proposes a single energy conservation measure which is 
physically connected to all of the buildings. If a State ranks on a 
measure-by-measure basis, a measure that is physically connected to a 
number of buildings may be ranked as a single measure. Buildings or 
measures shall be ranked in accordance with the procedures established 
by the State Plan on the basis of the information developed during a 
technical assistance program (or its equivalent) for the building and 
the criteria for ranking applications. The criterion set forth in 
paragraph (1) of this subsection shall receive at least 50 percent of 
the weight given to the criteria used to rank applications. Each State 
may assign weights to the other criteria as set

[[Page 572]]

forth in the State Plan pursuant to Sec. 455.20(e). The criteria for 
ranking applications are:
    (1) Simple payback or a life-cycle cost analysis, calculated in 
accordance with Sec. 455.63 and Sec. 455.64, as applicable;
    (2) The types and quantities of energy to be saved, including oil, 
natural gas, or electricity, in a priority as established in the 
approved State Plan;
    (3) The types of energy sources to which conversion is proposed, 
including renewable energy;
    (4) The quality of the technical assistance program report; and
    (5) Other factors as determined by the State.
    (d) A State is exempt from the ranking requirements of this section 
when:
    (1) The total amount requested by all applications for schools and 
hospitals for technical assistance and energy conservation measures in a 
given grant program cycle for grants up to 50 percent is less than or 
equal to the funds available to the State for such grants and the total 
amount recommended for hardship funding is less than or equal to the 
amounts available to the State for such grants and
    (2) The total amount requested by all applications for buildings 
owned by units of local government and public care institutions in a 
given grant program cycle is less than or equal to the total amount 
allocated to the State for technical assistance program grants in the 
State;
    (e) If a State elects to permit applications for credit pursuant to 
Sec. 455.102, such applications for completed or partially completed 
energy conservation measures shall reflect both the work done and the 
work to be done and will be reviewed and ranked on the basis of the cost 
of all of the measures in the project. The credit shall not exceed the 
non-Federal share of the proposed additional energy conservation 
measures (and the Federal share shall not exceed the cost of the work 
remaining to be done).
    (f) Within the rankings of school and hospital buildings for 
technical assistance and energy conservation measures including 
renewable resource measures to the extent that approvable applications 
are submitted, a State shall initially assure that:
    (1) Schools receive at least 30 percent of the total funds allocated 
for schools and hospitals to the State in any grant program cycle and
    (2) Hospitals receive at least 30 percent of the total funds 
allocated for schools and hospitals to the State in any grant program 
cycle.
    (g) If there are insufficient applications from schools or hospitals 
to cover the respective 30 percent requirements specified in paragraph 
(f) of this section, then the State may recommend use of the remaining 
funds in those allocations for other qualified applicants.


<R05>
Sec. 455.132  State evaluation of requests for severe hardship assistance.

    (a) To the extent provided in Sec. 455.30(d), financial assistance 
will be initially available for schools and hospitals experiencing 
severe hardship based upon an applicant's inability to provide the non-
Federal share as specified in the State plan pursuant to Sec. 455.20(g). 
This financial assistance will be available only to the extent necessary 
to enable such institutions to participate in the program.
    (b) The State shall recommend funds for severe hardship applications 
wholly or partially from the funds reserved in accordance with 
Sec. 455.30(d) and as stated in an approved State Plan.
    (c) Applications for Federal funding in excess of the non-Federal 
share in the State plan pursuant to Sec. 455.20(x) based on claims of 
severe hardship shall be given an additional evaluation by the State to 
assess on a quantifiable basis to the maximum extent practicable the 
relative need among eligible institutions. The minimum amount of 
additional Federal funding necessary for the applicant to participate in 
the program will be determined by the State in accordance with the 
procedures established in the State Plan. The primary consideration 
shall be the institution's inability to provide the non-Federal share of 
the project cost as specified in the State plan pursuant to 
Sec. 455.20(x). Secondary criteria such as climate, fuel cost and fuel 
availability, borrowing capacity, median family income in the area, and 
other relevant factors as determined by the State may

[[Page 573]]

be addressed in the State Plan as specified in Sec. 455.20(g).
    (d) A State shall indicate, for those schools and hospitals with the 
highest rankings, determined pursuant to Sec. 455.131(b) and (c):
    (1) The amount of additional hardship funding requested by each 
eligible applicant for each building determined to be in a class of 
severe hardship and
    (2) The amount of hardship funding recommended by the State based 
upon relative need, as determined in accordance with the State Plan, to 
the limit of the hardship funds available. The State must decide on a 
case-by-case basis whether, and to what extent, it will recommend 
hardship funding.
    (e) If there are insufficient applications from hardship applicants 
to cover the 10 percent allocation provided for in Sec. 455.30(d), then 
the State may recommend use of the remaining funds for other qualified 
applicants. The total amount recommended for hardship grants cannot 
exceed the 10 percent limit.


<R05>
Sec. 455.133  Forwarding of applications from institutions and coordinating agencies for technical assistance and energy conservation measure grants.

    (a) Except as provided by Sec. 455.92 of this part, each State shall 
forward all applications recommended for funding within its allocation 
to DOE once each program cycle along with a listing of buildings or 
measures covered by eligible applications for schools, hospitals, units 
of local government, and public care institutions ranked by the State if 
necessary pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 455.131. If ranking has 
been employed, the list shall include the standings of buildings or 
measures.
    (1) Measure-by-measure rankings will be recombined for the 
respective buildings with more than one recommended measure and
    (2) Buildings will be consolidated under one grantee application.
    (b) The State shall indicate the amount of financial assistance 
requested by the applicant for each eligible building and, for those 
buildings recommended for funding within the limits of the State's 
allocation, the amount recommended for funding. If the amount 
recommended is less than the amount requested by the applicant, the list 
shall also indicate the reason for that recommendation.
    (c) The State shall indicate that it has reviewed and evaluated all 
of the submitted applications and that those applications meet the 
relevant requirements of the program, and shall certify that 
applications submitted are eligible pursuant to Sec. 455.130(a).


<R05>
Sec. 455.134  Forwarding of applications for State grants for technical assistance, program assistance, and marketing.

    A State eligible to apply for grants for technical assistance, 
program assistance, or marketing, as described in Sec. 455.121, may 
submit such an application to DOE any time after the allocations have 
been announced as part of, or in lieu of, an application for a grant for 
State administrative expenses. Such applications shall provide separate 
narrative descriptions, budgets and appropriate milestone dates, 
covering each activity or program, that are sufficiently detailed to 
enable DOE to reasonably evaluate the application.


<R05>
Sec. 455.135  State liaison, monitoring, and reporting.

    Each State shall be responsible for:
    (a) Consulting with eligible institutions and coordinating agencies 
representing such institutions in the development of its State Plan;
    (b) Notifying eligible institutions and coordinating agencies of the 
content of the approved State Plan and any amendment to a State Plan;
    (c) Notifying each applicant how the applicant's building or measure 
ranked among other applications, and whether and to what extent its 
application will be recommended for funding or if not to be recommended 
for funding, the specific reasons(s) therefor;
    (d) Certifying that each institution has given its assurance that it 
is willing and able to participate on the basis of any changes in 
amounts recommended for that institution in the State ranking pursuant 
to Sec. 455.131;
    (e) Reporting requirements pursuant to Sec. 455.113; and
    (f) Direct program oversight and monitoring of the activities for 
which grants are awarded as defined in the

Sec. 455.140  Approval of applications from institutions and coordinating agencies for technical assistance and energy conservation measures.

    (a) DOE shall review and approve applications submitted by a State 
in accordance with Sec. 455.133 if DOE determines that the applications 
meet the objectives of the Act, and comply with the applicable State 
Plan and the requirements of this part. DOE may disapprove all or any 
portion of an application to the extent funds are not available to carry 
out a program or measure (or portion thereof) contained in the 
application, or for such other reason as DOE may deem appropriate.
    (b) DOE shall notify a State and the applicant of the final approval 
or disapproval of an application at the earliest practicable date after 
the DOE receipt of the application, and, in the event of disapproval, 
shall include a statement of the reasons therefor.
    (c) An application which has been disapproved for reasons other than 
lack of funds may be amended to correct the cause of its disapproval and 
resubmitted in the same manner as the original application at any time 
within the same grant program cycle. Such an application will be 
considered to the extent funds have not already been designated for 
applicants by the ranking process at the time of resubmittal. However, 
nothing in this provision shall obligate either the State or DOE to take 
final action regarding a resubmitted application within the grant 
program cycle. An application not acted upon may be resubmitted in a 
subsequent grant program cycle.
    (d) DOE shall not provide supplemental funds to cover cost overruns 
or other additional costs beyond those provided for in the original 
grant award for technical assistance projects and shall fund only one 
technical assistance project per building.
    (e) DOE shall not provide supplemental funds to cover cost overruns 
or other additional costs beyond those provided for in the original 
grant award for energy conservation measures funded under a grant in a 
given grant program cycle. DOE shall not provide funds to cover energy 
conservation measures intended to replace energy conservation measures 
funded in an earlier grant cycle unless the State has funds remaining 
after all applications for new energy conservation measures have been 
evaluated and submitted to DOE for funding.
    (f) If provided for in the State Plan, an applicant may reapply for 
a technical assistance program or an energy conservation measure grant 
which was included in a prior grant application but which was not 
implemented and for which no funds were expended.
    (g) An applicant may apply for, and DOE may make, grant awards in 
another grant program cycle for additional energy conservation measures 
which relate to a building which previously received grants for other 
energy conservation measures.
    (h) Funds which become available to a grantee after the installation 
of all approved measures, due to cost underruns in the installed 
measures, may be used by the grantee for additional measures if such 
measures are approved in writing by the State and DOE.
    (i) DOE may fund costs incurred by an applicant for technical 
assistance and energy conservation measure projects after the date of 
the grant application, so long as that date is no earlier than the close 
of the preceding grant program cycle. Such costs may be funded when, in 
the judgment of DOE, the applicant has complied with program 
requirements and the costs incurred are allowable under applicable cost 
principles and the approved project budget. The applicant bears the 
responsibility for the entire project cost unless the application is 
approved by DOE in accordance with this part.
    (j) In addition to the prior approval requirements for project 
changes as specified in the DOE Financial Assistance Rules (10 CFR part 
600), a grantee shall request prior written approval from DOE before:
    (1) Transferring DOE or matching amounts between buildings included 
in an approved application when the

[[Page 575]]

State ranks applications on a building-by-building basis or
    (2) Transferring DOE or matching amounts between energy conservation 
measures included in an approved application when the State ranks on a 
measure-by-measure basis.

<R05>
Sec. 490.200  Purpose and scope.

    This subpart sets forth rules implementing the provisions of Section 
507(o) of the Act which requires, subject to some exemptions, that 
certain percentages of new light duty motor vehicles acquired for State 
fleets be alternative fueled vehicles.


<R05>
Sec. 490.201  Alternative fueled vehicle acquisition mandate schedule.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this part, of the new light duty 
motor vehicles acquired annually for State government fleets, including 
agencies thereof but excluding municipal fleets, the following 
percentages shall be alternative fueled vehicles for the following model 
years;
    (1) 10 percent for model year 1997;
    (2) 15 percent for model year 1998;
    (3) 25 percent for model year 1999;
    (4) 50 percent for model year 2000; and
    (5) 75 percent for model year 2001 and thereafter.
    (b) Each State shall calculate its alternative fueled vehicle 
acquisition requirements for the State government fleets, including 
agencies thereof, by applying the alternative fueled vehicle acquisition 
percentages for each model year to the total number of new light duty 
motor vehicles to be acquired during that model year for those fleets.
    (c) If the calculation performed under paragraph (b) of this section 
produces a number that requires the acquisition of a partial vehicle, an 
adjustment to the acquisition number will be made by rounding the number 
of vehicles down the next whole number if the fraction is less than one 
half and by rounding the number of vehicles up to the next whole number 
if the fraction is equal to or greater than one half.
    (d) A State fleet that first becomes subject to this part after 
model year 1997 shall acquire alternative fueled vehicles in the next 
model year at the percentage applicable to that model year according to 
the schedule in paragraph (a) of this section, unless the State is 
granted an exemption or reduction of the acquisition percentage pursuant 
to the procedures and criteria in section 490.204.


<R05>

light duty vehicle (regardless of the model year of manufacture), 
capable of operating on alternative fuels that was not previously under 
control of the State or State agency;
    (b) The purchase or lease of an after-market converted light duty 
vehicle (regardless of model year of manufacture), that was not 
previously under control of the State or State agency;
    (c) The conversion of a newly purchased or leased light duty vehicle 
to operate on alternative fuels within four months after the vehicle is 
acquired for a State fleet; and
    (d) The application of alternative fueled vehicle credits allocated 
under subpart F of this part.

been approved by DOE under this section.
    (2) Any Light Duty Alternative Fueled Vehicle Plan must provide for 
voluntary acquisitions or conversions, or combinations thereof, by 
State, local, and private fleets that equal or exceed the State's 
alternative fuel vehicle acquisition requirement under section 490.201.
    (3) Any acquisitions of light duty alternative fueled vehicles by 
participants in the State plan may be included for purposes of 
compliance, irrespective of whether the vehicles are in

[[Page 596]]

excluded categories set forth in section 490.3 of this part.
    (4) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section or except 
for a fleet exempt under section 490.204, a State that does not have an 
approved plan in effect under this section is subject to the State fleet 
acquisition percentage requirements of section 490.201.
    (5) If a significant commitment under an approved plan is not met by 
a participant of a plan, the State shall meet its percentage 
requirements under section 490.201 or submit to DOE an amendment to the 
plan for DOE approval.

required by this section.
    (b) A covered person requesting an exemption must demonstrate that--
    (1) Alternative fuels that meet the normal requirements and 
practices of the principal business of the covered person are not 
available from fueling sites that would permit central fueling of that 
person's vehicles in the area in which the vehicles are to be operated; 
or
    (2) Alternative fueled vehicles that meet the normal requirements 
and practices of the principal business of the covered person are not 
available for purchase or lease commercially on reasonable terms and 
conditions in any State included in a MSA/CMSA that the vehicles are 
operated in.
    (c) Documentation. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c) (2) of 
this section, if a covered person is seeking an exemption under
